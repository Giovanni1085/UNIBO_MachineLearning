On the ninth of De cember, 1635, lie had returned to Canada, and on the 7th of October, 1637, was married at Quebec, and the next month, went to Three Rivers, where he lived until 1642, when he died. Of him it is said, in a letter written in 1640, that he had pen etrated farthest into those distant countries, and that if he had proceeded \" three days more on a great river which flows from that lake [Green Bay] he would have found the sea.\" The Dakotahs, called by the Ojibways, Nado waysioux, or Sioux (Soos), as abbreviated by the French, used to claim superiority over other peo ple, because, their sacred men asserted that the mouth of the Minnesota River was immediately over the centre of the earth, and below the centre of the heavens. The first white men in Minnesota, of whom we have any record, were, according to Garneau, two persons of Huguenot affinities, Medard Chouart, known as Sieur Groselliers, and Pierre d'Esprit, called Sieur Radisson. While this teaching is very different from that of the modern astronomer, it is certainly true, that the region west of Lake Superior, extending through the valley of the Minnesota, to the Mis- souri River, is one of the most healthful and fer- tile regions beneath the skies, and may prove to be the centre of the republic of the United States of America. Baron D'Avagour, a brave officer, who was killed in fighting the Turks, while he was Governor of Canada, in a dispatch to the French Government, dated August 14th, 1663, after referring to Lake Huron, wrote, that beyond \" is met another, called Lake Superior, the waters of which, it is believed, flow into New Spain, and this, according to general opinion, ought to be the centre of the country.-\" Groselliers (pronounced Gro-zay-yay) was born near Ferte-sous-Jouarre, eleven miles east of Meaux, in France, and when about sixteen years of age, in the year 1641, came to Canada. The fur trade was the great avenue to prosperity, and in 1646, he was among the Huron Indians, who then dwelt upon the eastern shore of Lake Huron, bartering for peltries. On the second of Septem ber, 1647, at Quebec, he was married to Helen, the widow of Claude Etienne, who was the daugh ter of a pilot, Abraham Martin, whose baptismal name is still attached to the suburbs of that city, the \"Plains of Abraham,\" made famous by the death there, of General Wolfe, of the English army, in 1759, and of General Montgomery, of the Continental armv, in December, 1775, at the As early as 1635, one of Champlain's interpre ters, Jean Nicolet (Mcolay), who came to Cana da in 1618, reached the western shores of Lake Michigan.

In the year 1659, Groselliers and Radisson arrived at Chagouamik on, and determined to visit the Hurons and Pe tuns, with, whom the former had traded when they resided east of Lake Huron. After a six days' journey, in a southwesterly direction, they reached their retreat toward the sources of the Black, Chippewa, and Wisconsin Rivers. From' this point they journeyed north, and passed the winter of 1659-60 among the \" Nadouechiouec,\" or Sioux villages in the Mille Lacs (Mil Lak) re gion. From the Hurons they learned of a beau tiful river, wide, large, deep, and comparable with the Saint Lawrence, the great Mississippi, which flows through the city of Minneapolis, and whose sources are in northern Minnesota. commencement of the \" War for Independence.\" His son, Medard, was born in 1657, and the next year his mother died. The second wife of Gro selliers was Marguerite Hayet (Hayay) Radisson, the sister of his associate, in the exploration of the region west of Lake Superior. Radisson was born at St. Malo, and, while a boy, went to Paris, and from thence to Canada, and in 1656, at Three Rivers, married Elizabeth, the daughter of Madeleine Hainault, and, after her death, the daughter of Sir David Kirk or Kerkt, a zealous Huguenot, became his wife. The Iroquois of New York, about the year 1650, drove the Hurons from their villages, and forced them to take refuge with their friends the Tinon- tates, called by the French, Petuns, because they cultivated tobacco. In time the Hurons and their allies, the Ottawas (Ottaw-waws), were again driven by the Iroquois, and after successive wanderings, were found on the west side of Lake Michigan. In time they reached the Mississippi, and ascending above the Wisconsin, they found the Iowa River, on the west side, which they fol- lowed, and dwelt for a time with the Ayoes (loways) who were very friendly ; but being ac- customed to a country of lakes and forests, they were not satisfied with the vast prairies. Return- ing to the Mississippi, they ascended this river, in search of a better land, and were met by some of the Sioux or Dakotahs, and conducted to their villages, where they were well received. The Sioux, delighted with the axes, knives and awls of European manufacture, which had been pre- sented to them, allowed the refugees to settle upon an island in the Mississippi, below the mouth of the St. Croix River, called Bald Island from the absence of trees, about nine miles from the site of the present city of Hastings. Possessed of firearms, the Hurons and Ottawas asserted their superiority, and determined to conquer the country for themselves, and having incurred the hostility of the Sioux, were obliged to flee from the isle in the Mississippi. Descending below Lake Pepin, they reached the Black River, and ascending it, found an unoccupied country around its sources and that of the Chippeway. In this region the Hurons estabhshed themselves, while their allies, the Ottawas, moved' eastward, till they found the shores of Lake Superior, and set tled at Chagouamikon (Sha - gah - wah - mik - ong ) Northeast of Mille Lacs, toward the extremity of Lake Superior, they met the \" Poualak,\" or Assiniboines of the prairie, a separated band of the Sioux, who, as wood was scarce and small, made fire with coal (charbon de terre) and dwelt in tents of skins ; although some of the more in dustrious built cabins of clay (terre grasse), like the swallows build their nests. The spring and summer of 1660, Groselliers and Radisson passed in trading around Lake Superior. On the 19th of August they returned to Mon treal, with three hundred Indians and sixty ca noes loaded with \" a wealth of skins.\" \" Furs of bison and of beaver, Furs of sable and of ermine.\" The citizens were deeply stirred by the travelers' tales of the vastness and richness of the region they had visited, and their many romantic adven tures. In a few days, they began their return to the far West, accompanied by six Frenchmen and two priests, one of whom was the Jesuit, ReneMe nard. His hair whitened by age, and his mind ripened by long experience, he seemed the man for the mission. Two hours after midnight, of the day before departure, the venerable missionary penned at \" Three Rivers,\" the following letter to a friend : 'Reverend Father : \" The peace of Christ be with you : I write to you probably the last, which I hope will be the seal of our friendship until eternity.

Let your friendship, my good Father, be useful to me by the desirable fruits of your daily sacrifice. Upon De l'lsle's map of Louisiana, published nearly two centuries ago, there appears the Lake of the Ottawas, and the Lake of the Old or De serted Settlement, west of Green Bay, and south of Lake Superior. The Lake of the Old Planta tion is supposed to have been the spot occupied by the Hurons at the time when Menard attempt ed to visit them. One way of access to this seclu ded spot was from Lake Superior to the head waters of the Ontanagon River, and then by a port age, to the lake. It could also be reached from the head waters of the Wisconsin, Black and Chip pewa Rivers, and some have said that Menard descended the Wisconsin and ascended the Black River. \" In three or four months you may remember me at the memento for the dead, on account of my old age, my weak constitution and the hard ships I lay under amongst these tribes. Never theless, I am in peace, for I have not been led to this mission by any temporal motive, but I think it was by the voice of God. I was to resist the grace of God by not coming. Eternal remorse would have tormented me, had I not come when I had the opportunity. \" We have been a little surprized, not being able to provide ourselves with vestments and oth er things, but he who feeds the little birds, and clothes the lilies of the fields, will take care of his servants; and though it should happen we should die of want, we would esteem ourselves happy. I am burdened with business. What I can do is to recommend our journey to your daily sacrifice, and to embrace you with the same sen timents of heart as I hope to do in eternity. Perrot, who lived at the same time, writes : \" Father Menard, who was sent as missionary among the Outaouas [Utaw-waws] accompanied by certain Frenchmen who were going to trade with that people, was left by all who were with him, except one, who rendered to him until death, all of the services and help that he could have hoped. The Father followed the Outaouas [Utaw waws]to the Lake of the Illinoets [Illino-ay, now Michigan] and in their flight to the Louisianne, [Mississippi] to above the Black River. There this missionary had but one Frenchman for a companion. This Frenchman carefully followed the route, and made a portage at the same place as the Outaouas. He found himself in a rapid, one day, that was carrying him away in his canoe. The Father, to assist, debarked from his own, but did not find a good path to come to him. He en tered one that had been made by beasts, and de siring to return, became confused in a labyrinth of trees, and was lost. The Frenchman, after having ascended the rapids with great labor, awaited the good Father, and, as he did not come, resolved to search for him. With all his might, for several days, he called his name in the woods, hoping to find him, but it was useless. He met, however, a Sakis [Sauk] who was carrying the camp-kettle of the missionary, and who gave him some intelligence. He assured him that he had found his foot -prints at some distance, but that he had not seen the Father. He told him, also, that he had found the tracks of several, who were going towards the Scioux. He declared that he supposed that the Scioux might have killed or captured him. Indeed, several years afterwards, \" My Reverend Father, Your most humble and affectionate servant in Jesus Christ. R. MENARD. \"From the Three Rivers, this 26th August, 2 o'clock after midnight, 1660.\" On the loth of October, the party with which he journeyed reached a bay on Lake Superior, where he found some of the Ottawas, who had fled from the Iroquois of New York. For more than eight months, surrounded by a few French voyageurs, he lived, to use his words, \" in a kind Of- small hermitage, a cabin built of fir branches piled one on another, not so much to shield us from the rigor of the season as to correct my im agination, and persuade me I was sheltered.\" During the summer of 1661, he resolved to visit the Hurons, who had fled eastward from the Sioux of Minnesota, and encamped amid the marshes of Northern Wisconsin. Some Frenchmen, who had been among the Hurons, in vain attempted to dis suade him from the journey. To their entreaties he replied, \" I must go, if it cost me my life. I can not suffer souls to perish on the ground of saving the bodily life of a miserable old man like myself. What! Are we to serve God only when there is nothing to suffer, and no risk of life?\""], [18, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF 3IINNES0TA. 4 They are forty or fifty leagues from here, in a country of prairies, abounding in all kinds of game. They have fields, in which they do not sow Indian corn, but only tobacco. Providence has provided them with a species of marsh rice, which, toward the end of summer, they go to col lect in certain small lakes, that are covered with it. They presented me with some when I was at the extremity of Lake Tracy [Superior], where I saw them. They do not use the gun, but only the bow and arrow with great dexterity. Their cabins are not covered with bark, but -with deer skins well dried, and stitched together so that the cold does not enter. These people are above all other savage and warlike. In our presence they seem abashed, and were motionless as statues. They speak a language entirely unknown to us, and the savages about here do not understand them.\" there were found among this tribe, his breviary and cassock, which they exposed at their festivals, making offerings to them of food.\" In a journal of the Jesuits, Menard, about the seventh or eighth of August, 1661, is said to have been lost. Groselliers (Gro-zay-yay), while Menard was endeavoring to reach the retreat of the Hurons which he had made known to the authorities of Canada, was pushing through the country of the Assineboines, on the northwest shore of Lake Superior, and at length, probably by Lake Alem pigon, or Nepigon, reached Hudson's Bay, and early in May, 1662, returned to Montreal, and surprised its citizens with his tale of new discov eries toward the Sea of the North. The Hurons did not remain lpng toward the sources of the Black River, after Menard's disap pearance, and deserting their plantations, joined their allies, the Ottawas, at La Pointe, now Bay field, on Lake Superior. While here, they deter mined to send a war party of one hundred against the Sioux of Mille Lacs (Mil Lak) region. At length they met their foes, who drove them into one of the thousand marshes of the water-shed between Lake Superior and the Mississippi, where they hid themselves among the tall grasses. The Sioux, suspecting that they might attempt to es cape in the night, cut up beaver skins into strips, and hung thereon little bells, which they had ob tained from the French traders. The Hurons, emerging from their watery hiding place, stumbled over the unseen cords, ringing the bells, and the Sioux instantly attacked, killing all but one. The mission at La Pointe was not encouraging, and Allouez, \" weary of their obstinate unbelief ,\" departed, but Marquette succeeded him for abrief period. The \"Relations\" of the Jesuits for 1670-71, allude to the Sioux or Dakotahs, and their attack upon the refugees at La Pointe : \" There are certain people called Nadoussi, dreaded by their neighbors, and although they only use the bow and arrow, they use it with so much skill and dexterity, that in a moment they fill the air. After the Parthian method, they turn their heads in flight, and discharge their ar rows so rapidly that they are to be feared no less in their retreat than in their attack. About the year 1665, four Frenchmen visited the Sioux of Minnesota, from the west end of Lake Superior, accompanied by an Ottawa chief, and in the summer of the same year, a flotilla of canoes laden with peltries, came down to Mon treal. Upon their return, on the eighth of Au gust, the Jesuit Father, Allouez, accompanied the traders, and, by the first of October, reached Che goimegon Bay, on or near the site of the modern town of Bayfield, on Lake Superior, where he found the refugee Hurons and Ottawas. While on an excursion to Lake Alempigon, now Ne pigon, this missionary saw, near the mouth of Saint Louis River, in Minnesota, some of the Sioux. He writes : \" There is a tribe to the west of this, toward the great river called Messipi. \" They dwell on the shores and around the great river Messipi, of which we shall speak. They number no less than fifteen populous towns, and yet they know not how to cultivate the earth by seeding it, contenting themselves with a sort of marsh rye, which we call wild oats. \" For sixty leagues from the extremity of the upper lakes, towards sunset, and, as it were, in the centre of the western nations, they have all united their force by a general league, which has been made against them, as against a common enemy. \" They speak a peculiar language, entirely dis tinct from that of the Algonquins and Hurons, whom they generally surpass in generosity, since they often content themselves with the glory of"], [19, "GROSELLIERS AND RADISSON IN THE ENGLISH SER VICE. 5 having obtained the victory, and release the pris oners they have taken in battle. at the occurrence, and in a letter to Colbert, one of the Ministers of Louis the Fourteenth, speaks in condemnation of this discharge of a cannon by a Brother attached to the Jesuit Mission. \" Our Outouacs of the Point of the Holy Ghost [La Pointe, now Bayfield] had to the present time kept up a kind of peace with them, but affairs having become embroiled during last winter, and some murders having been committed on both sides, our savages had reason to apprehend that the storm would soon burst upon them , and j udged that it was safer for them to leave the place, which in fact they did in the spring.\" From this period, the missions of the Church of Rome, near Lake Superior, began to wane. Shea, a devout historian of that church, writes: \" In 1680, Father Enjalran was apparently alone at Green Bay, and Pierson at Mackinaw ; the latter mission still comprising the two villages, Huron and Kiskakon. Of the other missions, neither Le Clerq nor Hennepin, the Recollect, writers of the West at this time, makes any mention, or in any way alludes to their existence, and La Hon tan mentions the Jesuit missions only to ridicule them.\" Marquette, on the 13th of September, 1669, writes : \" The Nadouessi are the Iroquois of this country. * * * they lie northwest of the Mission of the Holy Ghost [La Pointe, the modern Bay field] and we have not yet visited them, having confined ourselves to the conversion of the Otta was.\" The Pigeon River, a part of the northern boun dary of Minnesota, was called on the French maps Grosellier's River, after the first explorer of Min nesota, whose career, with his associate Radisson, became quite prominent in connection with the Hudson Bay region. Soon after this, hostilities began between the Sioux and the Hurons and Ottawas of La Pointe, and the former compelled their foes to seek an other resting place, toward the eastern extremity of Lake Superior, and at length they pitched their tents at Mackinaw. A disagreement occurring between Groselliers and his partners in Quebec, he proceeded to Paris, and from thence to London, where he was intro duced to the nephew of Charles I., who led the cavalry charge against Fairfax and Cromwell at Naseby, afterwards commander of the English fleet. The Prince listened with pleasure to the narrative of travel, and endorsed the plans for prosecuting the fur trade and seeking a north west passage to Asia. The scientific men of Eng land were also full of the enterprise, in the hope that it would increase a knowledge of nature. The Secretary of the Royal Society wrote to Rob ert Boyle, the distinguished philosopher, a too sanguine letter. His words were : \" Surely I need not tell you from hence what is said here, with great joy, of the discovery of a northwest passage; and by two Englishmen and one Frenchman represented to his Majesty at Oxford, and an swered by the grant of a vessel to sail into Hud son's Bay and channel into the South Sea.\" In 1674, some Sioux warriors came down to Sault Saint Marie, to make a treaty of peace with adjacent tribes. A friend of the Abbe de Galli nee wrote that a council was had at the fort to which \"the Nadouessioux sent twelve deputies, and the others forty. During the conference, one of the latter, knife in hand, drew near the breast of one of the Nadouessioux, who showed surprise at the movement ; when the Indian with the knife reproached him for cowardice. The Nadouessioux said he was not afraid, when the other planted the knife in his heart, and killed him. All the savages then engaged in conflict, and the Nadouessioux bravely defended them selves, but, overwhelmed by numbers, nine of them were killed. The two who survived rushed into the chapel, and closed the door. Here they found munitions of war, and fired guns at their enemies, who became anxious to burn down the chapel, but the Jesuits would not permit it, be cause they had their skins stored between its roof and ceiling. In this extremity, a Jesuit, Louis Le Boeme, advised that a cannon should be point ed at the door, which was discharged, and the two brave Sioux were killed.\" The ship Nonsuch was fitted out, in charge of Captain Zachary Gillam, a son of one of the early settlers of Boston ; and in this vessel Groselliers and Radisson left the Thames, in June, 1668, and in September reached a tributary of Hudson's Bay. The next year, by way of Boston, they re turned to England, and in 1670, a trading com- Governor Frontenac of Canada, was indignant"], [20, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 6 pany was chartered, still known among venerable English corporations as \"The Hudson's Bay Company.\" He has taken possession of this great region for the King of England, and for his personal benefit A publication for the benefit of this French ad venturer, has been made in England. He was a youth when he arrived here, and his wife and children are yet here.\" The Reverend Mother of the Incarnation, Su perior of the Ursulines of Quebec, in a letter of the 27th of August, 1670, writes thus : Talon, Intendent of Justice in Canada, in a dis patch to Colbert, Minister of the Colonial Depart ment of France, wrote on the 10th of November, 1670, that he has received intelligence that two English vessels are approaching Hudson's Bay, and adds : \" After reflecting on all the nations that might have penetrated as far north as that, I can alight on only the English, who, under the guidance of a man named Des Grozellers, for merly an inhabitant of Canada, might possibly have attempted that navigation.\" \"It was about this time that a Frenchman of our Touraine, named des Groselliers, married in this country, and as he had not been successful in making a fortune, was seized with a fancy to go to New England to better his condition. He excited a hope among the English that he had found a passage to the Sea of the North. With this expectation, he was sent as an envoy to Eng- Sand. where there was given to him, a vessel, with crew and every thing necessary for the voy age. With these advantages, he put to sea, and in place of the usual route, which others had ta ken in vain, he sailed in another direction, and searched so wide, that he found the grand Bay of the North. He found large population, and filled his ship or ships with peltries of great value. * * * After years of service on the shores of Hudson's Bay, either with English or French trading com panies, the old explorer died in Canada, and it has been said that his son went to England, where he was hving in 1696, in receipt of a pension."], [21, "EARLY MENTION OF LAKE SUPERIOR COPPER. 7 CHAPTER II.

This island is twenty-five leagues in length ; it is seven from the mainland, and sixty from the head of the lake. Nearly all around the island, on the water's edge, pieces of copper are found mixed with pebbles, but espe cially on the side which is opposite the south, and principally in a certain bay, which is near the northeast exposure to the great lake. * * * Before white men had explored the shores of Lake Superior, Indians had brought to the tra ding posts of the St. Lawrence River, specimens of copper from that region. Sagard, in his History of Canada, published in 1636, at Paris, writes : \" There are mines of copper which might be made profitable, if there were inhabitants and work men who would labor faithfully . That would be done if colonies were established. About eighty or one hundred leagues from the Hurons, there is a mine of copper, from which Truchemont Brusle showed me an ingot, on his return from a voyage which he made to the neighboring nation.\" \" Advancing to the head of the lake (Fon du Lac) and returning one day's journey by the south coast, there is seen on the edge of the water, a rock of copper weighing seven or eight hundred pounds, and is so hard that steel can hardly cut it, but when it is heated it cuts as easily as lead. Near Point Chagouamigong [Sha - gah - wah - mik ong, near Bayfield] where a mission was establish ed rocks of copper and plates of the same metal were found. * * * Returning still toward the mouth of the lake, following the coast on the south as twenty leagues from the place last mentioned, we enter the river called Nantaouagan [Ontona gon] on which is a hill where stones and copper fall into the water or upon the earth. They are readily found. Pierre Boucher, grandfather of Sieur de la Ve rendrye, the explorer of the lakes of the northern boundary of Minnesota, in a volume published A. D. 1640, also at Paris, writes : \" In Lake Su perior there is a great island, fifty or one hundred leagues in circumference, in which there is a very beautiful mine of copper. There are other places in those quarters, where there are similar mines ; so I learned from four or five Frenchmen, who lately returned. They were gone three years, without finding an opportunity to return; they told me that they had seen an ingot of copper all refined which was on the coast, and weighed more than eight hundred pounds, according to their es timate. They said that the savages, on passing it, made a fire on it, after which they cut off pie ces with their axes.\" \" Three years smce we received a piece wThich was brought from this place, which weighed a hundred pounds, and we sent it to Quebec to Mr. Talon. It is not certain exactly where this was broken from. We think it was from the forks of the river ; others, that it was from near the lake, and dug up.\" Talon, Intendent of Justice in Canada, visited France, taking a half-breed voyageur with him, and while in Paris, wrote on the 26th of Febru ary, 1669, to Colbert, the Minister of the Marine Department, \"that this voyageur had penetrated among the western nations farther than any other Frenchman, and had seen the copper mine on Lake Huron. [Superior:1] The man offers to go In the Jesuit Relations of 1666-67, there is this description of Isle Royale : \" Advancing to a place called the Grand Anse, we meet with an island, three leagues from land, which is cele brated for the metal which is found there, and for the thunder which takes place there; for they say it always thunders there."], [22, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 8 to that mine, and explore, either by sea, or by lake and river, the communication supposed to exist between Canada and the South Sea, or to the regions of Hudson's Bay.\" between two high hills, the plain above which feeds the lakes, and receives a great deal of snow, which, in melting, forms torrents which wash the borders of this river, composed of solid gravel, which is rolled down by it. As soon as Talon returned to Canada he com missioned Jolliet and Pere [Perrot] to search for the mines of copper on the upper Lakes. Jolliet received an outfit of four hundred livres, and four canoes, and Perrot one thousand livres. Minis ister Colbert wrote from Paris to Talon, in Feb ruary, 1671, approving of the search for copper, in these words : \" The resolution you have taken to send Sieur de La Salle toward the south, and Sieur de St. Lusson to the north, to discover the South Sea passage, is very good, but the principal tiling you ought to apply yourself in discoveries of this nature, is to look for the copper mine. \" The gravel at the bottom of this, hardens it self, and assumes different shapes, such as those pebbles which I send to Mr. Bellinzany. My opinion is that these pebbles, rounded and carried off by the rapid waters, then have a tendency to become copper, by the influence of the sun's rays which they absorb, and to form other nuggets of metal similar to those which I send to Sieur de Bellinzany, found by the Sieur de Saint Luspon, about four hundred leagues, at some distance from the mouth of the river. \" He hoped by the frequent journeys of the savages, and French who are beginning to travel by these routes, to discern the source of produc tion.\" \" Were this mine discovered, and its utility evident, it would be an assured means to attract several Frenchmen from old, to New France.\" On the 14th of June, 1671, Saint Lusson at Sault St. Marie, planted the arms of France, in the pres ence of Nicholas Perrot, who acted as interpreter on the occasion ; the Sieur Jolliet ; Pierre Moreau or Sieur de la Taupine ; a soldier of the garrison of Quebec, and several other Frenchmen. Governor Denonville, of Canada, sixteen years after the above circumstances, wrote : \" The cop per, a sample of which I sent M. Arnou, is found at the head of Lake Superior. The body of the mine has not yet been discovered. I have seen one of our voyageurs who assures me that, some fifteen months ago he saw a lump of two hundred weight, as yellow as gold, in a river which falls into Lake Superior.

The Jesuit Fathers among the Outaouas [Ou-taw-waws] use an anvil of this ma terial, which weighs about one hundred pounds. There will be no rest until the source from whence these detached lumps come is discovered.

In a letter to Seignalay, published for the first time by Harrisse, he writes that it was in the village of Izatys [Issati]. Upon Fran quelin's map, the Mississippi branches into the Tintonha [Teeton Sioux] country, and not far from here, he alleges, was seen a tree upon which was this legend: \" Arms of the King cut on this tree in the year 1679.\" In the year 1678, several prominent merchants of Quebec and Montreal, with the support of Governor Frontenac of Canada, formed a com pany to open trade with the Sioux of Minnesota, and a nephew of Patron, one of these merchants, a brother-in-law of Sieur de Lusigny, an officer of the Governor's Guards, named Daniel Grey solon Du Luth [Doo-loo], a native of St. Germain en Laye, a few miles from Paris, although Lahon tan speaks of him as from Lyons, was made the leader of the expedition. At the battle of Seneffe against the Prince of Orange, he was a gendarme, and one of the King's guards. He estabhshed a post at Kamanistigoya, which was distant fifteen leagues from the Grand Port age at the western extremity of Lake Superior ; and here, on the fifteenth of September, he held a council with the Assenipoulaks [Assineboines] and other tribes, and urged them to be at peace with the Sioux. During this summer, he dis patched Pierre Moreau, a celebrated voyageur, nicknamed La Taupine, with letters to Governor Frontenac, and valuable furs to the merchants. His arrival at Quebec, created some excitement. It was charged that the Governor corresponded with Du Luth, and that he passed the beaver, sent by him, in the name of merchants in his in terest. The Intendant of Justice, Du Chesneau, wrote to the Minister of the Colonial Department of France, that \" the man named La Taupine, a famous coureur des bois, who set out in the month of September of last year, 1678, to go to the Ou tawacs, with goods, and who has always been in terested with the Governor, having returned this year, and I, being advised that he had traded in Du Luth was also a cousin of Henry Tonty, who had been in the revolution at Naples, to throw off the Spanish dependence. Du Luth's name is va riously spelled in the documents of his day. Hen nepin writes, \"Du Luth;\" others, \"Dulhut,\" \" Du Lhu,\" \" Du Lut,\" \" De Luth,\" \" Du Lud.\" The temptation to procure valuable furs from the Lake Superior region, contrary to the letter of the Canadian law, was very great ; and more than one Governor winked at the contraband trade. Randin, who visited the extremity of Lake Superior, distributed presents to the Sioux and Ottawas in the name of Governor Frontenac, to secure the trade, and after his death, Du Luth was sent to complete what he had begun. With a party of twenty, seventeen Frenchmen and three Indians, he left Quebec on the first of September, 1678, and on the fifth of April, 1679, Du Luth writes to Governor Frontenac, that he is in the woods, about nine miles from Sault St. Marie, at the entrance of Lake Superior, and"], [24, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 10 with the Sioux ; and if their efforts were unsuc cessful, they expected to push on to the English, at Hudson's Bay.

Reach ing its head waters, by a short portage, of half a league, he reached a lake which was the source of the Saint Croix River, and by this, he and his companions were the first Europeans to journey in a canoe from Lake Superior to the Mississippi. La Salle writes, that Du Luth, finding that the Sioux were on a hunt in the Mississippi val ley, below the Saint Croix, and that Accault, Au gelle and Hennepin, who had come up from the Illinois a few weeks before, were with them, de scended until he found them.

Done at Montreal, the 5th September, 1679.\" La Taupine, in due time returned to Lake Su perior with another consignment of merchandise. The interpreter of Du Luth, and trader with the Sioux, was Faffart, who had been a soldier under La Salle at Fort Frontenac, and had deserted. \"Thirty-eight or forty leagues above the Chip peway they found the river by which the Sieur Du Luth did descend to the Mississippi. He had been three years, contrary to orders, with a com pany of twenty \" coureurs du bois\" on Lake Su perior; he had borne himself bravely, proclaiming everywhere that at the head of his brave fellows he did not fear the Grand Prevost, and that he would compel an amnesty. La Salle was commissioned in 1678, by the King of France, to explore the West, and trade in cibola, or buffalo skins, and on condition that he did not traffic with the Ottauwaws, who carried their beaver to Montreal. On the 27th of August, 1679, he arrived at Mackinaw, in the \" Griffin,\" the first sailing ves sel on the great Lakes of the West, and from thence went to Green Bay, where, in the face of his commission, he traded for beaver. Loading his vessel with peltries, he sent it back to Niag ara, while he, in canoes, proceeded with his ex pedition to the Hlinois River. The ship was never heard of, and for a time supposed to be lost, but La Salle afterward learned from a Pawnee boy fourteen or fifteen years of age, who was brought prisoner to his fort on the Illinois by some Indians, that the pilot of the \" Griffin \" had been among the tribes of the Upper Missouri. He had ascended the Mississippi with four others in two birch canoes with goods and some hand grenades, taken from the ship, with the intention of join ing Du Luth, who had for months been trading \" While he was at Lake Superior, the Nadoue sioux, enticed by the presents that the late Sieur Randin had made on the part of Count Fronte nac, and the Sauteurs [Ojibways], who are the sav ages who carry the peltries to Montreal, and who dwell on Lake Superior, wishing to obey the re peated orders of the Count, made a peace to unite the Sauteurs and French, and to trade with the Nadouesioux, situated about sixty leagues to the west of Lake Superior. Du Luth, to disguise his desertion, seized the opportunity to make some reputation for himself, sending two messen gers to the Count to negotiate a truce, during which period their comrades negotiated still bet ter for beaver. Several conferences were held with the Na-"], [25, "FAFFART, DU LUTH'S INTERPRETER. 11 douessioux, and as he needed an interpreter, he led off one of mine, named Faffart, formerly a sol dier at Fort Frontenac. During this period there were frequent visits between the Sauteurs [Ojib ways] and Nadouesioux, and supposing that it might increase the number of beaver skins, he sent Faffart by land, with the Nadouesioux and Sauteurs [Ojibways]. The young man on his re turn, having given an account of the quantity of beaver in that region, he wished to proceed thither himself, and, guided by a Sauteur and a Nadoue sioux, and four Frenchmen, he ascended the river Nemitsakouat, where, by a short portage, he de scended that stream, whereon he passed through forty leagues of rapids [Upper St. Croix River], and finding that the Nadouesioux were below with my men and the Father, who had come down again from the village of the Nadouesioux, he discovered them. They went up again to the village, and from thence they all together came down.

Upon his return to Canada, he departed for Mackinaw. Governor De la Barre, on the 9th of November, 1683, wrote to the French Government that the Indians west and north of Lake Superior, \" when they heard by expresses sent them by Du Lhut, of his arrival at Missili makinak, that he was coming, sent him word to come quickly and they would unite with him to prevent others going thither. If I stop that pass as I hope, and as it is necessary to do, as the Eng lish of the Bay [Hudson's] excite against us the savages, whom Sieur Du Lhut alone can quiet.\" While stationed at Mackinaw he was a partici pant in a tragic occurrence. During the summer of 1683 Jacques le Maire and Colin Berthot, while on their way to trade at Keweenaw, on Lake Su perior, were surprised by three Indians, robbed, and murdered. Du Luth was prompt to arrest and punish the assassins. In a letter from Mack inaw, dated April 12, 1684, to the Governor of Canada, he writes: \"Be pleased to know, Sir, that on the 24th of October last, I was told that Folle Avoine, accomplice in the murder and rob bery of the two Frenchmen, had arrived at Sault Ste. Marie with fifteen families of the Sauteurs [Ojibways] who had fled from Chagoamigon [La Pointe] on account of an attack which they, to gether with the people of the land, made last Spring upon the Nadouecioux [Dakotahs.] At this very period, another party charges Frontenac as being Du Luth's particular friend. Du Luth, during the fall of 1681, was engaged in the beaver trade at Montreal and Quebec. Du Chesneau, the Intendant of Justice for Can ada, on the 13th of November, 1681, wrote to the Marquis de Siegnelay, in Paris : \" Not content with the profits to be derived from the countries under the King's dominion, the desire of making money everywhere, has led the Governor [Fron tenac], Boisseau, Du Lut and Patron, his uncle, to send canoes loaded with peltries, to the En glish. It is said sixty thousand livres' worth has been sent thither ;\" and he further stated that there was a very general report that within five or six days, Frontenac and his associates had di vided the money received from the beavers sent to New England. \" He believed himself safe at the Sault, on ac count of the number of allies and relatives he had there. Rev. Father Albanel informed me that the French at the Saut, being only twelve in num ber, had not arrested him, believing themselves too weak to contend with such numbers, espe cially as the Sauteurs had declared that they would not allow the French to redden the land of their fathers with the blood of their brothers. \" On receiving this information, I immediately resolved to take with me six Frenchmen, and em bark at the dawn of the next day for Sault Ste. Marie, and if possible obtain possession of the murderer. I made known my design to the Rev. Father Engalran, and, at my request, as he had some business to arrange with Rev. Father Al banel, he placed himself in my canoe. At a conference in Quebec of some of the dis tinguished men in that city, relative to difficulties with the Iroquois, held on the 10th of October, 1682, Du Luth was present. From thence he went \" Having arrived within a league of the village"], [26, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 12 of the Saut, the Rev. Father, the Chevalier de Fourcille, Cardonnierre, and I disembarked. I caused the canoe, in which were Baribaud, Le Mere, La Fortune, and Macons, to proceed, while we went across the wood to the house of the Rev. Father, fearing that the savages, seeing me, might suspect the object of my visit, and cause Folle Avoine to escape. Finally, to cut the matter short, I arrested him, and caused him to be guarded day and night by six Frenchmen. Kiaonan [Keweenaw] under pretext of going to war in the spring against the Nadouecioux, to avenge the death of one of his relatives, son of Ou enaus, but really to protect himself against us, in case we should become convinced that his chil dren had killed the Frenchmen. This precaution placed me between hope and fear respecting the expedition which M. Pere [Perrot] had under taken. \" On the 24th of November, [1683], he came across the wood at ten o'clock at night, to tell me that he had arrested Achiganaga and four of his children. He said they were not all guilty of the murder, but had thought proper, in this affair, to follow the custom of the savages, which is to seize all the relatives. Folle Avoine, whom I had ar rested, he considered the most guilty, being with out doubt the originator of the mischief. \"I then called a council, at which I requested all the savages of the place to be present, where I repeated what I had often said to the Hurons and Ottawas since the departure of M. Pere [Per rot], giving them the message you ordered me, Sir, that in case there should be among them any spirits so evil disposed as to follow the example of those who have murdered the French on Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, they must separate the guilty from the innocent, as I did not wish the whole nation to suffer, unless they protected the guilty. * * * The savages held several councils, to which I was invited, but their only object seemed to be to exculpate the prisoner, in order that I might release him. \" I immediately gave orders that Folle Avoine should be more closely confined, and not allowed to speak to any one ; for I had also learned that he had a brother, sister, and uncle in the village of the Kiskakons. \" M. Pere informed me that he had released the youngest son of Achiganaga, aged about thirteen or fourteen years, that he might make known to their nation and the Sauteurs [Ojibways], who are at Nocke and in the neighborhood, the reason why the French had arrested his father and bro thers. M. Pere bade him assure the savages that if any one wished to complain of what he had done, he would wait for them with a firm step ; for he considered himself in a condition to set them at defiance, having found at Kiaonau [Keweenaw] eighteen Frenchmen who had wintered there. \" All united in accusing Achiganaga and his children, assuring themselves with the belief that M. Pere, [Perrot] with his detachment would not be able to arrest them, and wishing to persuade me that they apprehended that all the Frenchmen might be killed. \" I answered them, * * * 'As to the antici pated death of M. Pere [Perrot], as well as of the other Frenchmen, that would not embarrass me, since I believed neither the allies nor the nation of Achiganaga would wish to have a war with us to sustain an action so dark as that of which we were speaking. Having only to attack a few murderers, or, at most, those of their own family, I was certain that the French would have them dead or alive.' \" On the 25th, at daybreak, M. Pere embarked at the Sault, with four good men whom I gave him, to go and meet the prisoners. He left them four leagues from there, under a guard of twelve Frenchmen ; and at two o'clock in the afternoon, they arrived. I had prepared a room in my house for the prisoners, in which they were placed under a strong guard, and were not allowed to converse with any one. \" This was the answer they had from me during the three days that the councils lasted; after which I embarked, at ten o'clock in the morning, sustained by only twelve Frenchmen, to show a few unruly persons who boasted of taking the prisoner away from me, that the French did not fear them. \" On the 26th, I commenced proceedings ; and this, sir, is the course I pursued. I gave notice to all the chiefs and others, to appear at the council which I had appointed, and gave to Folle Avoine the privilege of selecting two of his rela- \" Daily I received accounts of the number of savages that Achiganaga drew from his nation to"], [27, "INDIANS CONDEMNED TO BE SHOT. 13 tives to support his interests ; and to the other prisoners I made the same offer. the French that were here, and, after the interro gations and answers of the accused had been read to them, the guilt of the three appeared so evi dent, from their own confessions, that the vote was unanimous that all should die. But as the French who remained at Kiaonan to pass the win ter had written to Father Engalran and to myself, to beg us to treat the affair with all possible len iency, the savages declaring that if they made the prisoners die they would avenge themselves, I told the gentlemen who were with me in coun cil that, this being a case without a precedent, I believed it was expedient for the safety of the French who would pass the winter in the Lake Superior country to put to death only two, as that of the third might bring about grievous conse quences, while the putting to death, man for man, could give the savages no complaint, since this is their custom. M. de la Tour, chief of the Fathers, who had served much, sustained my opinions by strong reasoning, and all decided that two should be shot, namely, Folle Avoine and the older of the two brothers, while the younger should be released, and hold his life, Sir, as a gift from you. \" The council being assembled, I sent for Folle Avoine to be interrogated, and caused his answers to be written, and afterwards they were read to him, and inquiry made whether they were not, word for word, what he had said. He was then removed under a safe guard. I used the same form with the two eldest sons of Achiganaga, and, as Folle Avoine had indirectly charged the father with being accessory to the murder, I sent for him and also for Folle Avoine, and bringing them into the council, confronted the four. \" Folle Avoine and the two sons of Achiganaga accused each other of committing the murder, without denying that they were participators in the crime. Achiganaga alone strongly maintained that he knew nothing of the design of Folle Avoine, nor of his children, and called on them to say if he had advised them to kill the French men. They answered, ' No.' \" This confrontation, which the savages did not expect, surprised them; and, seeing the prisoners had convicted themselves of the murder, the Chiefs said: 'It is enough; you accuse your selves; the French are masters of your bodies.' \" I then returned to the cabin of Brochet with Messrs. Boisguillot, Pere, De Repentigny, De Manthet, De la Ferte, and Macons, where were all the chiefs of the Outawas du Sable, Outawas Sinagos, Kiskakons, Sauteurs, D'Achiliny, a part of the Hurons, and Oumamens, the chief of the Amikoys. I informed them of our decision * * * that, the Frenchmen having been killed by the different nations, one of each must die, and that the same death they had caused the French to suffer they must also suffer. * * * This decision to put the murderers to death was a hard stroke to them all, for none had believed that I would dare to undertake it. * * * I then left the council and asked the Rev. Fathers if they wished to baptize the prisoners, which they did. \" The next day I held another council, in which I said there could be no doubt that the French men had been murdered, that the murderers were known, and that they knew what was the prac tice among themselves upon such occasions. To all this they said nothing, which obliged us on the following day to hold another council in the cabin of Brochet, where, after having spoken, and seeing that they would make no decision, and that all my councils ended only in reducing tobacco to ashes, I told them that, since they did not wish to decide, I should take the responsibility, and that the' next day I would let them know the deter mination of the French and myself. \" It is proper, Sir, you should know that I ob served all these forms only to see if they would feel it their duty to render to us the same justice that they do to each other, having had divers ex amples in which when the tribes of those who had committed the murder did not wish to go to war with the tribe aggrieved, the nearest rela tions of the murderers killed them themselves; that is to say, man for man. \"An hour after, I put myself at the head of forty-two Frenchmen, and, in sight of more than four hundred savages, and within two hundred paces of their fort, I caused the two murderers to be shot. The impossibility of keeping them until spring made me hasten their death. * * * When M. Pere made the arrest, those who had committed the murder confessed it; and when he asked them what they had done with our goods, \" On the 29th of November. I gathered together"], [28, "14 EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. they answered that they were almost all con cealed. He proceeded to the place of conceal ment, and was very much surprised, as were also the French with him, to find them, in fifteen or twenty different places. By the carelessness of the savages, the tobacco and powder were entire ly destroyed, having been placed in the pinery, under the roots of trees, and being soaked in the water caused by ten or twelve days' continuous rain, which inundated all the lower country. The season for snow and ice having come, they had all the trouble in the world to get out the bales of cloth. council, that in future the savages need not think by presents to save those who commit similar deeds. Besides, sir, M. Pere showed plainly by his conduct, that he is not strongly inclined to favor the savages, as was reported. Indeed, I do not know any one whom they fear more, yet who flatters them less or knows them better. \" The criminals being in two different places, M. Pere being obliged to keep four of them, sent Messrs. de Repentigny, Manthet, and six other Frenchmen, to arrest the two who were eight leagues in the woods. Among others, M. de Re pentigny and M. de Manthet showed that they feared nothing when their honor called them. \" They then went to see the bodies, but could not remove them, these miserable WTetches hav ing thrown them into a marsh, and thrust them down into holes which they had made. Not sat isfied with this, they had also piled branches of trees upon the bodies, to prevent them from float ing when the water should rise in the spring, hoping by this precaution the French would find no trace of those who were killed, but would think them drowned ; as they reported that they had found in the lake on the other side of the Portage, a boat with the sides all broken in, which they believed to be a French boat. \" M. de la Chevrotiere has also served well in person, and by his advice, having pointed out where the prisoners were. Achiganaga, who had adopted him as a son, had told him where he should hunt during the winter. * * * * * It still remained for me to give to Achiganaga and his three children the means to return to his family. Their home from which they were taken was nearly twenty-six leagues from here. Know ing their necessity, I told them you would not be satisfied in giving them life ; you wished to pre serve it, by giving them all that was necessary to prevent them from dying with hunger and cold by the way, and that your gift was made by my hands. I gave them blankets, tobacco, meat, hatchets, knives, twine to make nets for beavers, and two bags of corn, to supply them till they could kill game. \" Those goods which the French were able to secure, they took to Kiaonau [Keweenaw], where were a number of Frenchmen who had gone there to pass the winter, who knew nothing of the death of Colin Berthot and Jacques le Maire, until M. Pere arrived. \" The ten who formed M. Pere's detachment having conferred together concerning the means they should take to prevent a total loss, decided to sell the goods to the highest bidder. The sale was made for 1100 livres, which was to be paid in beavers, to M. de la Chesnaye, to whom I send the names of the purchsers. \" They departed two days after, the most con tented creatures in the world, but God was not ; for when only two days' journey from here, the old Achiganaga fell sick of the quinsy, and died, and his children returned. When the news of his death arrived, the greater part of the savages of this place [Mackinaw] attributed it to the French, saying we had caused him to die. I let them talk, and laughed at them. It is only about two months sin ce the children of Achiganaga returne 1 toKiaonan.\" \u2022' The savages who were present when Achiga naga and his children were arrested wished to pass the calumet to M. Pere, and give him cap tives to satisfy him for the murder committed on the two Frenchmen ; but he knew their inten tion, and would not accept their offer. He told them neither a hundred captives nor a hundred packs of beaver would give back the blood of his brothers ; that the murderers must be given up to me, and I would see what I would do. Some of those opposed to Du Luth and Fron tenac, prejudiced the King of France relative to the transaction we have described, and in a letter to the Governor of Canada, the King writes : \" It appears to me that one of the principal causes of the war arises from one Du Luth having caused two to be killed who had assassinated two French- \" I caused M. Pere to repeat these things in the"], [29, "ENGLISH TRADERS CAPTURED. 15 men on Lake Superior ; and you sufficiently see now much this man's voyage, which can not pro duce any advantage to the colony, and which was permitted only in the interest of some private persons, has contributed to distract the peace of the colony.\" The design of this post was to block the pas sage of the English to the upper lakes. Before it was estabhshed, in the fall of 1686, Thomas Roseboom, a daring trader from Albany, on the Hudson, had found his way to the vicinity of Mackinaw, and by the proffer of brandy, weak ened the allegiance of the tribes to the French. Du Luth and his young brother appear to have traded at the western extremity of Lake Superior, and on the north shore, to Lake Nipegon. A canoe coming to Mackinaw with dispatches for the French and their allies, to march to the Seneca country, in New York, perceived this New York trader and associates, and, giving the alarm, they were met by three hundred coureurs du bois and captured. In June, 1684, Governor De la Barre sent Guil let and Hebert from Montreal to request Du Luth and L>urantaye to bring down voyageurs and In dians to assist in an expedition against the Iro quois of New York. Early in September, they reported on the St. Lawrence, with one hundred and fifty coureurs des bois and three hundred and fifty Indians ; but as a treaty had just been made with the Senecas, they returned. In the spring of 1687 Du Luth, Durantaye, and Tonty all left the vicinity of Detroit for Ni agara, and as they were coasting along Lake Erie they met another Enghsh trader, a Scotchman by birth, and by name Major Patrick McGregor, a person of some influence, going with a number of traders to Mackinaw. Having taken him pris oner, he was sent with Roseboom to Montreal. DelaBarre's successor, Governor Denonville, in a dispatch to the French Government, dated November 12th, 1685, alludes to Du Luth being in the far West, in these words : \" I likewise sent to M. De la Durantaye, who is at Lake Superior under orders from M. De la Barre, and to Sieur Du Luth, who is also at a great distance in an other direction, and all so far beyond reach that neither the one nor the other can hear news from me this year ; so that, not being able to see them at soonest, before next July, I considered it best not to think of undertaking any thing during the whole of next year, especially as a great number of our best men are among the Outaouacs, and can not return before the ensuing summer. * * * In regard to Sieur Du Luth, I sent him orders to repair here, so that I may learn the number of savages on whom I may depend. He is accredit ed among them, and rendered great services to M. De la Barre by a large number of savages he brought to Niagara, who would have attacked the Senecas, was it not for an express order from M. De la Barre to the contrary.\" Du Luth, Tonty, and Durantaye arrived at Ni agara on the 27th of June, 1687, with one hun dred and seventy French voyageurs, besides In dians, and on the 10th of July joined the army of Denonville at the mouth of the Genesee River, and on the 13th Du Luth and his associates had a skirmish near a Seneca village, now the site of the town of Victor, twenty miles southeast of the city of Rochester, New York. Governor Denon ville, in a report, writes: \" On the 13th, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, having passed through two dangerous defiles, we arrived at the third, where we were vigorously attacked by eight hun dred Senecas, two hundred of whom fired, wish ing to attack our rear, while the rest would attack our front, but the resistance, made produced such a great consternation that they soon resolved to fly. * * * We witnessed the painful sight of the usual cruelties of the savages, who cut the dead into quarters, as is done in slaughter houses, in order to put them into the kettle. The greater number were opened while still warm, that the blood might be drunk.

A portion of the order reads as follows : \" After having given all the orders that you may judge necessary for the safety of this post, and having well secured the obedience of the Indians, you will return to Michilimackinac, there to await Rev.

It is neces sary to examine this proposition. If the mission aries care for only the extension of commerce, pursuing the course they have hitherto, I agree to it; but if it is the use of brandy that hinders the advancement of the cause of God, I deny it, for it is a fact which no one can deny that there are a great number of savages who never drink brandy, yet who are not, for that, better Chris tians. misfortune that this wound will prevent him go ing back again, for he is a man of capacity.\" In the order to Du Luth assigning him to duty at the post on the site of the modern Fort Gra tiot, above the city of Detroit, the Governor of Canada said: \" If you can so arrange your affairs that your brother can be near you in the Spring, I shall be very glad. He is an intelligent lad, and might be a great assistance to you; he might also be very serviceable to us.\" This lad, Greysolon de la Tourette, during the winter of 1686-7 was trading among the Assina boines and other tribes at the west end of Lake Superior, but, upon receiving a dispatch, hastened to his brother, journeying in a canoe without any escort from Mackinaw. He did not arrive until after the battle with the Senecas. Governor Den onville, on the 25th of August, 1687, wrote: \"All the Sioux, the most numerous of all the tribes, who inhabit the region along the shore of Lake Superior, do not even like the smell of brandy. Are they more advanced in religion for that'_' They do not wish to have the subject men tioned, and when the missionaries address them they only laugh at the foolishness of preaching. Yet these priests boldly fling before the eyes of Europeans, whole volumes filled with glowing descriptions of the conversion of souls by thou sands in this country, causing the poor missiona ries from Europe, to run to martyrdom as flies to sugar and honey.\" \" Du Luth's brother, who has recently arrived from the rivers above the Lake of the Allempi gons [Nipegon], assures me that he saw more than fifteen hundred persons come to trade with him, and they were very sorry he had not goods suffi cient to satisfy them. They are of the tribes ac customed to resort to the English at Port Nelson and River Bourbon, where, they say, they did not go this year, through Sieur Du Lhu's influence.\" After the battle in the vicinity of Rochester, New York, Du Luth, with his celebrated cousin, Henry Tonty, returned together as far as the post above the present city of Detroit, Michigan, but this point, after 1688, was not again occupied. Du Luth, or Du Lhut, as he wrote his name, during this discussion, was found upon the side of order and good morals. His attestation is as follows : \"I certify that at different periods I have lived about ten years among the Ottawa nation, from the time that I made an exploration to the Nadouecioux people until Fort Saint Jo seph was established by order of the Monsieur Marquis Denonville, Governor General, at the head of the Detroit of Lake Erie, which is in the Iroquois country, and which I had the honor to command. During this period, I have seen that the trade in eau-de-vie (brandy) produced great disorder, the father killing the son, and the son throwing his mother into the fire; and I maintain that, morally speaking, it is impossible to export brandy to the woods and distant missions, with out danger of its leading to misery.\" From this period Du Luth becomes less prom inent. At the time when the Jesuits attempted to exclude brandy from the Indian country a bit ter controversy arose between them and the traders. Cadillac, a Gascon by birth, command ing Fort Buade, at Mackinaw, on August 3, 1695, wrote to Count Frontenac: \"Now, what reason can we assign that the savages should not drink brandy bought with their own money as well as we? Is it prohibited to prevent them from be coming intoxicated? Or is it because the use of brandy reduces them to extreme misery, placing it out of their power to make war by depriving them of clothing and arms? If such representa tions in regard to the Indians have been made to the Count, they are very false, as every one knows who is acquainted with the ways of the savages. * * * It is bad faith to represent to the Count Governor Frontenac, in an expedition against the Oneidas of New York, arrived at Fort Fron tenac, on the 19th of July, 1695, and Captain Du Luth was left in command with forty soldiers,"], [31, "DU LUTH AFFLICTED WITH GOUT. 17 and masons and carpenters, with orders to erect new buildings.

La Salle writes to his friends in Paris, that Du Luth is looked upon as an outlaw by the governor. While official documents prove that Du Luth was in Minnesota a year before Accault and asso ciates, yet La Salle writes: \" Moreover, the Na donesioux is not a region which he has discov ered. It is known that it was discovered a long time before, and that the Rev. Father Hennepin and Michael Accault were there before him.\" La Salle in this communication describes Ac cault as one well acquainted with the language and names of the Indians of the Illinois region, and also \" cool, brave, and prudent,\" and the head of the party of exploration. In the summer of 1680, Michael Accault ( Ako), Hennepin, the Franciscan missionary, Augelle, Du Luth, and Faffart all visited the Falls of Saiut Anthony. We now proceed with the first description of the country above the Wisconsin, to which is given, for the first and only time, by any writer, the Sioux name, Meschetz Odeba, perhaps in tended for Meshdeke Wakpa, River of the Foxes. The first description of the valley of the upper Mississippi was written by La Salle, at Fort Frontenac, on Lake Ontario, on the 22d of Au gust, 1682, a month before Hennepin, in Paris, obtained a license to print, and some time before the Franciscan's first work, was issued from the press. He describes the Upper Mississippi in these words : \" Following the windings of the Missis sippi, they found the river Ouisconsing, Wiscon sing, or Meschetz Odeba, which flows between Bay of Puans and the Grand river. * * * About twenty-three or twenty-four leagues to the north or northwest of the mouth of the Ouisconsing, * * * they found the Black river, called by the Nadouesioux, Chabadeba [Chapa Wakpa, Beaver river] not very large, the mouth of which is bor dered on the two shores by alders. La Salle's knowledge must have been received from Michael Accault, the leader of the expedi tion, Augelle, his comrade, or the clerical attache, the Franciscan, Hennepin. It differs from Hennepin's narrative in its free dom from bombast, and if its statements are to be credited, the Franciscan must be looked on as one given to exaggeration. The careful student, however, soon learns to be cautious in receiving the statement of any of the early explorers and ecclesiastics of the Northwest. The Franciscan depreciated the Jesuit missionary, and La Salle did not hesitate to misrepresent Du Luth and others for his own exaltation. La Salle makes \" Ascending about thirty leagues, almost at the same point of the compass, is the Buffalo river [Chippewa], as large at its mouth as that of the Illinois. They follow it ten or twelve leagues, where it is deep, small and without rapids, bor dered by hills which widen out from time to time to form prairies.\" statements which we deem to be wide of the truth when his prejudices are' aroused. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th of April, 1680, the travelers were met by a war party of one hundred Sioux in thirty-three birch bark canoes. \"Michael Accault, who was the At the very time that the Intendant of Justice in Canada is complaining that Governor Fronte nac is a friend and correspondent of Du Luth,"], [33, "HENNEPIN CRITICISED BY LA SALLE. 19 leader,\" says La Salle, \" presented the Calumet.\" The Indians were presented by Accault with twenty knives and a fathom and a half of tobacco and some goods. Proceeding with the Indians ten days, on the 22d of April the isles in the Mis sissippi were reached, where the Sioux had killed some Maskoutens, and they halted to weep over the death of two of their own number ; and to assuage their grief, Accault gave them in trade a box of goods and twenty-four hatchets. and he speaks more conformably to that which he wishes than to that which he knows.\" Hennepin was born in Ath, an inland town of the Netherlands. From boyhood he longed to visit foreign lands, and it is not to be wondered at that he assumed the priest's garb, for next to the soldier's life, it suited one of wandering pro pensities. At one time he is on a begging expedition to some of the towns on the sea coast. In a few months he occupies the post of chaplain at an hospital, where he shrives the dying and admin isters extreme unction. From the quiet of the hospital he proceeds to the camp, and is present at the battle of Seneffe, which occurred in the year 1674. When they were eight leagues below the Falls of Saint Anthony, they resolved to go by land to their village, sixty leagues distant. They were well received ; the only strife among the villages was that which resulted from the desire to have a Frenchman in their midst. La Salle also states that it was not correct to give the impression that Du Luth had rescued his men from captivity, for they could not be properly called prisoners. His whole mind, from the time that he became a priest, appears to have been on \" things seen and temporal,\" rather than on those that are \" un seen and eternal.\" While on duty at some of the ports of the Straits of Dover, he exhibited she characteristic of an ancient Athenian more than that of a professed successor of the Apostles. He sought out the society of strangers \" who spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.\" With perfect non chalance he confesses that notwithstanding the nauseating fumes of tobacco, he used to slip be hind the doors of sailors' taverns, and spend days, without regard to the loss of his meals, listening to the adventures and hair-breadth escapes of the mariners in lands beyond the sea. He continues: \" In going up the Mississippi again, twenty leagues above that river [Saint Croix] is found the falls, which those I sent, and who passing there first, named Saint Anthony. It is thirty or forty feet high, and the river is nar rower here than elsewhere. There is a small island in the midst of the chute, and the two banks of the river are not bordered by high hills, which gradually diminish at this point, but the country on each side is covered with thin woods, such as oaks and other hard woods, scattered wide apart. \" The canoes were carried three or four hun dred steps, and eight leagues above was found the west [east?] bank of the river of the Nadoue sioux, ending in a lake named Issati, which ex pands into a great marsh, where the wild rice grows toward the mouth.\" In the year 1676, he received a welcome order from his Superior, requiring him to embark for Canada. Unaccustomed to the world, and arbi trary in his disposition, he rendered the cabin of the ship in which he sailed any thing but heav enly. As in modern days, the passengers in a vessel to the new world were composed of hete rogeneous materials. There were young women going out in search for brothers or husbands, ec clesiastics, and those engaged in the then new, but profitable, commerce in furs. One of his fellow passengers was the talented and enterpri prising, though unfortunate, La Salle, with whom he was afterwards associated. If he is to be credited, his intercourse with La Salle was not very pleasant on ship-board. The young women, tired of being cooped up in the narrow accommo dations of the ship, when the evening was fair In the latter part of his letter La Salle uses the following language relative to his old chaplain: \" I believed that it was appropriate to make for you the narrative of the adventures of this canoe, because I doubt not that they will speak of it, and if you wish to confer with the Father Louis Hen nepin, Recollect, who has returned to France, you must know him a little, because he will not fail to exaggerate all things; it is his character, and to me he has written as if he were about to be burned when he was not even in danger, but he beheves that it is honorable to act in this maimer,"], [34, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 20 which he called Crevec\u0153ur, on account of the many disappointments he had experienced. sought the deck, and engaged in the rude dances of the French peasantry of that age. Hennepin, feeling that it was improper, began to assume the air of the priest, and forbade the sport. La Salle, feeling that his interference was uncalled for, called him a pedant, and took the side of the girls, and during the voyage there were stormy discussions. On the last of February, Accault, Augelle, and Hennepin left to ascend the Mississippi. The first work bearing the name of the Rev erend Father Louis Hennepin, Franciscan Mis sionary of the Recollect order, was entitled, \" De scription de la Louisiane,\" and in 1683 published hi Paris. Good humor appears to have been restored when they left the ship, for Hennepin would oth erwise have not been the companion of La Salle As soon as the book appeared it was criticised. Abbe Bernou, on the 29th of February, 1684, writes from Rome about the \"paltry book\" (mes hcant livre) of Father Hennepin. About a year before the pious Tronson, under date of March 13, 1683, wrote to a friend: \" I have interviewed the P. Recollect, who pretends to have descended the Mississippi river to the Gulf of Mexico. I do not know that one will believe what he speaks any more than that which is in the printed relation of P. Louis, which I send you that you may make your own reflections.\" in his great western journey. Sojourning for a short period at Quebec, the adventure-loving Franciscan is permitted to go to a mission station on or near tbe site of the present town of Kingston, Canada West. Here there was much to gratify his love of novelty, and he passed considerable time in ram bling among the Iroquois of New York. In 1678 he returned to Quebec, and was ordered to join the expedition of Robert La Salle. On the map accompanying his first book, he boldly marks a Recollect Mission many miles north of the point he had visited. In the Utrecht edition of 1697 this dehberate fraud is erased. On the 6th of December Father Hennepin and a portion of the exploring party had entered the Niagara river. In the vicinity of the Falls, the winter was passed, and while the artisans were preparing a ship above the Falls, to navigate the great lakes, the Recollect whiled away the hours, in studying the manners and customs of the Sen eca Indians, and in admiring the sublimest han diwork of God on the globe. Throughout the work he assumes, that he was the leader of the expedition, and magnifies trifles into tragedies. For instance, Mr. La Salle writes that Michael Accault, also written Ako, who was the leader, presented the Sioux with the calu met ;\" but Hennepin makes the occurrence more formidable. On the 7th of August, 1679, the ship being completely rigged, unfurled its sails to the breezes of Lake Erie. The vessel was named the \" Grif fin,\" in honor of the arms of Frontenac, Governor of Canada, the first ship of European construc tion that had ever ploughed the waters of the He writes : \" Our prayers were heard, when on the 11th of April, 1680, about two o'clock in the afternoon, we suddenly perceived thirty -three bark canoes manned by a hundred and twenty Indians coming down with very great speed, on a war party, against the Miamis, Illinois and Maro as. These Indians surrounded us, and while at a distance, discharged some arrows at us, but as they approached our canoe, the old men seeing us with the calumet of peace in our hands, prevent ed the young men from killing us. These sava ges leaping from their canoes, some on land, others into the water, with frightful cries and great inland seas of North America. After encountering a violent and dangerous storm on one of the lakes, during which they had given up all hope of escaping shipwreck, on the 27th of the month, they were safely moored in the harbor of \" Missihmackinack.\" From thence the party proceeded to Green Bay, where they left the ship, procured canoes, and continued along the coast of Lake Michigan. By the mid dle of January, 1680, La Salle had conducted his expedition to the Illinois River, and, on an emi nence near Lake Peoria, he commenced, with much heaviness of heart, the erection of a fort, yells approached us, and as we made no resist ance, being only three against so great a number, one of them wrenched our calumet from our hands, while our canoe and theirs were tied to the shore. We first presented to them a piece of"], [35, "HENNEPIN'S DIFFICULTY WITH PRAYER-BOOK. 21 French tobacco, better for smoking than theirs-* and the eldest among them uttered the words' \" Miamiha, Miamiha.\" so as not to be surprised asleep. The next morn ing, a chief named Narrhetoba asked for the peace calumet, filled it with willow bark, and all smoked. It was then signified that the white men were to return with them to their villages.\" \" As we did not understand their language, we took a little stick, and by signs which we made on the sand, showed them that their enemies, the Miamis, whom they sought, had fled across the river Colbert [Mississippi] to join the Islinois; when they saw themselves discovered and unable to surprise their enemies, three or four old men laying their hands on my head, wept in a mourn ful tone. In his narrative the Franciscan remarks, \" I found it difficult to say my office before these Indians. Many seeing me move my lips, said in a fierce tone, ' Ouakanche.' Michael, all out of countenance, told me, that if I continued to say my breviary, we should all three be killed, and the Picard begged me at least to pray apart, so as not to provoke them. I followed the latter's advice, but the more I concealed myself the more I had the Indians at my heels ; for when I en tered the wood, they thought I was going to hide some goods under ground, so that I knew not on what side to turn to pray, for they never let me out of sight. This obliged me to beg pardon of my canoe -men, assuring them I could not dis pense with saying my office. By the word, ' Ou akanche,' the Indians meant that the book I was reading was a spirit, but by their gesture they nevertheless showed a kind of aversion, so that to accustom them to it, I chanted the litany of the Blessed Virgin in the canoe, with my book opened. They thought that the breviary was a spirit which taught me to sing for their diversion ; for these people are naturally fond of singing.\" \" With a spare handkerchief I had left I wiped away their tears, but they would not smoke our Calumet. They made us cross the river with great cries, while all shouted with tears in their eyes; they made us row before them, and we heard yells capable of striking the most resolute with terror. After landing our canoe and goods, part of which had already been taken, we made a fire to boil our kettle, and we gave them two large wild turkeys which we had killed. These Indians having called an assembly to deliberate what they were to do with us, the two head chiefs of the party approaching, showed us by signs that the warriors wished to tomahawk us. This com pelled me to go to the war chiefs with one young man, leaving the other by our property, and throw into their midst six axes, fifteen knives and six fathom of our black tobacco ; and then bringing down my head, I showed them with an axe that they might kill me, if they thought proper. This present appeased many individual members, who gave us some beaver to eat, put ting the three first morsels into our mouths, accor ding to the custom of the country, and blowing on the meat, which was too hot, before putting the bark dish before us to let us eat as we liked. We spent the night in anxiety, because, before reti ring at night, they had returned us our peace calumet. This is the first mention of a Dahkotah word in a European book. The savages were annoyed rather than enraged, at seeing the white man reading a book, and exclaimed, \"Wakan-de!\" this is wonderful or supernatural. The war party was composed of several bands of the M'de wahkantonwan Dahkotahs, and there was a di versity of opinion in relation to the disposition that should be made of the white men. The relatives of those who had been killed by the Miamis, were in favor of taking their scalps, but others were anxious to retain the favor of the French, and open a trading intercourse. \" Our two boatmen were resolved to sell their lives dearly, and to resist if attacked ; their arms and swords were ready. As for my own part, I determined to allow myself to be killed without any resistance ; as I was going to announce to them a God who had been foully accused, un justly condemned, and cruelly crucified, without showing the least aversion to those who put him to death. We watched in turn, in our anxiety, Perceiving one of the canoe-men shoot a wild turkey, they caUed the gun, \" Manza Ouackange,\" iron that has understanding; more correctly, \" Maza Wakande,\" this is the supernatural metal. Aquipaguetin, one of the head men, resorted to the following device to obtain merchandise. Says the Father, \" This wily savage had the bones of some distinguished relative, which he"], [36, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 22 near the fire, he anointed his legs and the soles of his feet with wildcat oil. preserved with great care in some skins dressed and adorned with several rows of black and red porcupine quills. From time to time he assem bled his men to give it a smoke, and made us come several days to cover the bones with goods, and by a present wipe away the tears he had shed for him, and for his own son killed by the Miamis. To appease this captious man, we threw on the bones several fathoms of tobacco, axes, knives, beads, and some black and white wampum brace lets. * * * We slept at the point of the Lake of Tears [Lake Pepin], which we so called from the tears which this chief shed all night long, or by one of his sons whom he caused to weep when he grew tired.\" The son of the chief took great pleasure in car rying upon his bare back the priest's robe with dead men's bones enveloped. It was called Pere Louis Chinnen. In the Dahkotah language Shin na or Shinnan signifies a buffalo robe. Hennepin's description of his life on the island is hi these words : \" The day after our arrival, Aquipaguetin, who was the head of a large family, covered me with a robe made of ten large dressed beaver skins, trimmed with porcupine quills. This Indian showed me five or six of his wives, telling them, as I afterwards learned, that they shouP1 in fu ture regard me as one of their children. The next day, after four or five leagues' sail, a chief came, and telling them to leave their canoes, he pulled up three piles of grass for seats. Then taking a piece of cedar full of httle holes, he placed a stick into one, which he revolved between the palms of his hands, until he kindled a fire, and informed the Frenchmen that they would be at Mille Lac in six days. On the nineteenth day after their captivity, they arrived in the vicinity of Saint Paul, not far, it is probable, from the marshy ground on which the Kaposia band once lived, and now called Pig's Eye. \" He set before me a bark dish full of fish, and seeing that I could not rise from the ground, he had a small sweating-cabin made, in which he made me enter with four Indians. This cabin he covered with buffalo skins, and inside he put stones red-hot. He made me a sign to do as the others before beginning to sweat, but I merely concealed my nakedness with a handkerchief. As soon as these Indians had several times breathed out quite violently, he began to sing vo ciferously, the others putting their hands on me and rubbing me while they wept bitterly. I be gan to faint, but I came out and could scarcely take my habit to put on. When he made me sweat thus three times a week, I felt as strong as ever.\" The journal remarks, \" Having arrived on the nineteenth day of cur navigation, five leagues below St. Anthony's Falls, these Indians landed us in a bay, broke our canoe to pieces, and se creted their own in the reeds.\" They then followed the trail to Mille Lac, sixty leagues distant. As they approached their villa ges, the various bands began to show their spoils. The tobacco was highly prized, and led to some contention. The chalice of the Father, which glistened in the sun, they were afraid to touch, supposing it was \"wakan.\" After five days' walk they reached the Issati [Dahkotah] settle ments in the valley of the Rum or Knife river. The different bands each conducted a Frenchman to their village, the chief Aquipaguetin taking charge of Hennepin. After marching through the marshes towards the sources of Rum river, five wives of the chief, in three bark canoes, met them and took them a short league to an island where their cabins were. The mariner's compass was a constant source of wonder and amazement. Aquipaguetin hav ing assembled the braves, would ask Hennepin to show his compass. Perceiving that the needle turned, the chief harangued his men, and told them that the Europeans were spirits, capable of doing any thing. In the Franciscan's possession was an iron pot with feet like lions', which the Indians would not touch unless their hands were wrapped in buffalo skins. The women looked upon it as \"wakan,\" and would not enter the cabin where it was. \" The chiefs of these savages, seeing that I was desirous to leam, frequently made me write, naming all the parts of the human body ; and as I would not put on paper certain indelicate words, at which they do not blush, they were heartily amused.\" An aged Indian kindly rubbed down the way worn Franciscan; placing him on a bear -skin"], [37, "HENNEPIN'S VISIT TO FALLS OF SAINT ANTHONY. 23 They often asked the Franciscan questions, to answer which it was necessary to refer to his lex icon. This appeared very strange, and, as they had no word for paper, they said, \"That white thing must be a spirit which tells Pere Louis all we say.\" who believed that I had cured the child ; but she died soon after, to my great consolation. \" During my stay among them, there arrived four savages, who said they were come alone five hundred leagues from the west, and had been four months upon the way. They assured us there was no such place as the Straits of Anian, and that they had traveled without resting, except to sleep, and had not seen or passed over any great lake, by which phrase they always mean the sea. Hennepin remarks : \" These Indians often asked me how many wives and children I had, and how old I was, that is, how many winters; for so these natives always count. Never illu mined by the light of faith, they were surprised at my answer. Pointing to our two Frenchmen, whom I was then visiting, at a point three leagues from our village, I told them that a man among us could only have one wife ; that as for me, I had promised the Master of hfe to live as they saw me, and to come and live with them to teach them to be like the French. \" They further informed us that the nation of the Assenipoulacs [Assiniboines] who he north east of Issati, was not above six or seven days' journey ; that none of the nations, within their knowledge, who he to the east or northwest, had any great lake about their countries, which were very large, but only rivers, which came from the north. They further assured us that there were very few forests in the countries through which they passed, insomuch that now and then they were forced to make fires of buffaloes' dung to boil their food. All these circumstances make it appear that there is no such place as the Straits of Anian, as we usually see them set down on the maps. And whatever efforts have been made for many years past by the English and Dutch, to find out a passage to the Frozen Sea, they have not yet been able to effect it. But by the help of my discovery aud the assistance of God, I doubt not but a passage may still be found, and that an easy one too. \" But that gross people, till then lawless and faithless, turned all I said into ridicule. ' How,' said they, ' would you have these two men with thee have wives? Ours would not hve with them, for they have hair all over their face, and we have none there or elsewhere.' In fact, they were never better pleased with me than when I was shaved, and from a complaisance, certainly not criminal, I shaved every week. \" As often as I went to visit the cabins, I found a sick child, whose father's name was Mamenisi. Michael Ako would not accompany me ; the Picard du Gay alone followed me to act as spon sor, or, rather, to witness the baptism. \" For example, we may be transported into the Pacific Sea by rivers which are large and capable of carrying great vessels, and from thence it is very easy to go to China and Japan, without cross ing the equinoctial line. ; and, in all probability, Japan is on the same continent as America.\" \" I christened the child Antoinette, in honor of St. Anthony of Padua, as weU as for the Picard's name, which was Anthony Auguelle. He was a native of Amiens, and nephew of the Procurator- General of the Premonstratensians both now at Paris. Having poured natural water on the head and uttered these words : ' Creature of God, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,' I took half an altar cloth which I had wrested from the hands of an Indian who had stolen it from me, and put it on the body of the baptized child; for as I could not say mass for want of wine and vest ments, this piece of linen could not be put to bet ter use than to enshroud the first Christian child among these tribes. I do not know whether the softness of the linen had refreshed her, but she was the next day smiling in her mother's arms, Hennepin in his first book, thus describes his first visit to the Falls of St. Anthony: \"In the beginning of July, 1680, wre descended the [Rum] River hi a canoe southward, with the great chief Ouasicoude [Wauzeekootay] that is to say Pierced Pine, with about eighty cabins composed of more than a hundred and thirty families and about two hundred and fifty warriors. Scarcely would the Indians give me a place in their httle flotilla, for they had only old canoes. They went four leagues lower down, to get birch bark to make some more. Having made a hole in the ground, to hide our silver chalice and our papers, till our"], [38, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 24 return from the hunt, and keeping only our bre viary, so as not to be loaded, I stood on the bank of the lake formed by the river we had called St. Francis [now Rum] and stretched out my hand to the canoes as they rapidly passed in succession. offering as a sacrifice to the falls; which is, in it self, admirable and frightful. I heard him while shedding copious tears, say as he spoke to the great cataract, ' Thou who art a spirit, grant that our nation may pass here quietly, without acci dent ; may kill buffalo in abundance ; conquer our enemies, and bring in slaves, some of whom we will put to death before thee. The Messenecqz (so they call the tribe named by the French Outa gamis) have killed our kindred ; grant that we may avenge them.' This robe offered in sacrifice, served one of our Frenchmen, who took it as we returned.\" \"Our Frenchmen also had one for themselves, which the Indians had given them. They would not take me in, Michael Ako saying that he had taken me long enough to satisfy him. I was hurt at this answer, seeing myself thus abandoned by Christians, to whom I had always done good, as they both often acknowledged; but God never having abandoned me on that painful voyage, in spired two Indians to take me in their httle canoe, where I had no other employment than to bale out with a httle bark tray, the water which entered by httle holes. This I did not do with out getting all wet. This boat might, indeed, be called a death box, for its lightness and fragility. These canoes do not generally weigh over fifty pounds, the least motion of the body upsets them, unless you are long accustomed to that kind of navigation. It is certainly wonderful, that Hennepin, who knew nothing of the Sioux language a few weeks before, should understand the prayer offered at the Falls without the aid of an interpreter. The narrator continues: \"A league beyond St. Anthony of Padua's Falls, the Picard was obhged to land and get his powder horn, which he had left at the Falls. * * * As wre descended the river Colbert [Mississippi] we found some of our Indians on the islands loaded with buffalo meat, some of which they gave us. Two hours after landing, fifteen or sixteen warriors whom we had left above St. Anthony of Padua's Falls, en tered, tomakawk in hand, upset the cabin of those who had invited us, took all the meat and bear oil they found, and greased themselves from head to foot,\" \" On disembarking in the evening, the Picard, as an excuse, told me that their canoe was half rotten, and that had we been three in it, we should have run a great risk of remaining on the way. ***** Four days after our departure for the buffalo hunt, we halted eight leagues above St. Anthony of Padua's Falls, on an eminence opposite the mouth of the River St. Francis [Rum] * * * The Picard and myself went to look for haws, gooseberries, and httle wild fruit, which often did us more harm than good. This obliged us to go alone, as Michael Ako refused, in a wretched canoe, to Ouisconsin river, which was more than a hundred leagues off, to see whether the Sieur de la Salle had sent to that place a re inforcement of men, with powder, lead, and other munitions, as he had promised us. . This was done because the others had violated the rules for the buffalo hunt. With the Indians Hennepin went down the river sixty leagues, and then went up the river again, and met buffalo. He continues : \"While seeking the Ouisconsin River, that savage father, Aquipaguetin, whom I had left, and who I believed more than two hundred leagues off, on the 11th of July, 1680, appeared with the warriors.\" After this, Hennepin and Picard continued to go up the river almost eighty leagues. \"The Indians would not have suffered this voyage had not one of the three remained with them. They wished me to stay, but Michael Ako absolutely refused. As we were making the portage of our canoe at St. Anthony of Padua's Falls, we perceived five or six of our Indians who had taken the start ; one of them was up in an oak opposite the great fall, weeping bitterly, with a rich dressed beaver robe, whitened inside, and trimmed with porcupine quills, which he was There is great confusion here, as the reader will see. When at the mouth of the Rum River, he speaks of the Wisconsin as more than a hun dred leagues off. He floats down the river sixty leagues ; then he ascended, but does not state the distance; then he ascerjds eighty leagues. He continues : \" The Indians whom he had left with Michael Ako at Buffalo [Chippeway] River,"], [39, "HENNEPIN MEETS SIEUR DU LUTH. 25 with the flotilla of canoes loaded with meat, came down. * * * All the Indian women had their stock of meat at the mouth of Buffalo River .and on the islands, and again we went down the Col bert [Mississippi] about eighty leagues. * * * We had another alarm in our camp : the old men on duty on the top of the mountains announced that they saw two warriors in the distance ; all the bowmen hastened there with speed, each try ing to outstrip the others ; but they brought back only two of their enemies, who came to tell them that a party of their people were hunting at the extremity of Lake Conde [Superior] and had found four Spirits (so they call the French) who, by means of a slave, had expressed a wish to come on, knowing us to be among them. * * * On the 25th of July, 1680, as we were ascending the river Colbert, after the buffalo hunt, to the In dian villages, we met Sieur du Luth, who came to the Nadouessious with five French soldiers. They joined us about two hundred and twenty leagues distant from the country of the Indians who had taken us. As we had some knowledge of the language, they begged us to accompany them to the villages of these tribes, to which I readily agreed, knowing that these two French men had not approached the sacrament for two years.\" The second work of Hennepin, an enlargement of the first, appeared at Utrecht in the year 1697, ten years after La Salle's death. During the in terval between the publication of the first and second book, he had passed three years as Super intendent of the Recollects at Reny in the province of Artois, when Father Hyacinth Lefevre, a friend of La Salle, and Commissary Provincial of Recol lects at Paris, wished him to return to Canada. He refused, and was ordered to go to Rome, and upon his coming back was sent to a convent at St. Omer, and there received a dispatch from the Minister of State in France to return to the coun tries of the King of Spain, of which he was a subject. This order, he asserts, he afterwards learned was forged. In the preface to the English edition of the New Discovery, published in 1698, in London, he writes : \"The pretended reason of that violent order was because I refused to return into America, where I had been already eleven years ; though the particular laws of our Order oblige none of us to go beyond sea against his will. I would have, however, returned very willingly had I not known the malice of M. La Salle, who would have ex posed me to perish, as he did one of the men who accompanied me in my discovery. God knows that I am sorry for his unfortunate death ; but the judgments of the Almighty are always just, for the gentleman was killed by one of his own men, who were at last sensible that he exposed them to visible dangers without any necessity and for his private designs.\" Here again the number of leagues is confusing, and it is impossible to believe that Du Luth and his interpreter Faffart, who had been trading with the Sioux for more than a year, needed the help of Hennepin, who had been about three months with these people. We are not told by what route Hennepin and Du Luth reached Lake Issati or Mille Lacs, but Hennepin says they arrived there on the 11th of August, 1680, and he adds, \" Toward the end of September, having no implements to begin an establishment, we resolved to tell these people, that for their benefit, we would have to return to the French settlements. The grand Chief of the Issati or Nadouessiouz consented, and traced in pencil on paper I gave him, the route I should take for four hundred leagues. With this chart, we set out, eight Frenchmen, in two canoes, and descended the river St. Francis and Colbert [Rum and Mississippi]. Two of our men took two bea ver robes at St. Anthony of Padua's Falls, which the Indians had hung in sacrifice on the trees.\" After this he was for about five years at Gosse hes, in Brabant, as Confessor in a convent, and from thence removed to his native place, Ath, in Belgium, where, according to his narrative in the preface to the \" Nouveau Decouverte,\" he was again persecuted. Then Father Payez, Grand Commissary of Recollects at Louvain, being in formed that the King of Spain and the Elector of Bavaria recommended the step, consented that he should enter the service of William the Third of Great Britain, who had been very kind to the Roman Catholics of Netherlands. By order of Payez he was sent to Antwerp to take the lay habit in the convent there, and subsequently went to Utrecht, wliere he finished his second book known as the New Discovery."], [40, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 26 few wTords : \" Two of our men seized two beaver robes at the Falls of St. Anthony of Padua, which the Indians had in sacrifice, fastened to trees.\" But in the Utrecht edition, commencing on page 416, there is much added concerning Du Luth. After using the language of the edition of 1683, already quoted it adds: \"Hereupon there arose a dispute between Sieur du Luth and myself. I commended what they had done, say ing, 'The savages might judge by it that they disliked the superstition of these people.' The Sieur du Luth, on the contrary, said that they ought to have left the robes where the savages placed them, for they would not fail to avenge the insult we had put upon them by this action, and that it was feared that they would attack us on this journey. I confessed he had some foun dation for what he said, and that he spoke accor ding to the rules of prudence. But one of the two men flatly replied, the two robes suited them, and they cared nothing for the savages and their superstitions. The Sieur du Luth at these words was so greatly enraged that he nearly struck the one who uttered them, but I intervened and set tled the dispute. The Picard and Michael Ako ranged themselves on the side of those who had taken the robes in question, which might have resulted badly. His first volume, printed in 1683, contains 312 pages, with an appendix of 107 pages, on the Customs of the Savages, while the Utrecht book of 1697 contains 509 pages without an appendix. On page 249 of the New Discovery, he begins an account of a voyage alleged to have been made to the mouth of the Mississippi, and occupies over sixty pages in the narrative. The opening sentences give as a reason for concealing to this time his discovery, that La Salle would have re ported him to his Superiors for presuming to go down instead of ascending the stream toward the north, as had been agreed ; and that the two with him threatened that if he did not consent to de scend the river, they would leave him on shore during the night, and pursue their own course. He asserts that he left the Gulf of Mexico, to return, on the 1st of April, and on the 24th left the .Arkansas ; but a week after this, he declares he landed with the Sioux at the marsh about two miles below the city of Saint Paul. The account has been and is still a puzzle to the historical student. In our review of his first book we have noticed that as early as 1683, he claimed to have descended the Mississippi. In the Utrecht publication he declares that while at Quebec, upon his return to France, he gave to Father Valentine Roux, Commissary of Recol lects, his journal, upou the promise that it would be kept secret, and that this Father made a copy of his whole voyage, including the visit to the Gulf of Mexico ; but in his Description of Louis iana, Hennepin wrote, \" We had some design of going to the mouth of the river Colbert, which more probably empties into the Gulf of Mexico than into the Red Sea, but the tribes that seized us gave us no time to sail up and down the river.\" \" I argued with Sieur du Luth that the savages would not attack us, because I was persuaded that their great chief Ouasicoude would have our interests at heart, and he had great credit with his nation. The matter terminated pleasantly. \" When we arrived near the river Ouisconsin, we halted to smoke the meat of the buffalo we had killed on the journey. During our stay, three savages of the nation we had left, came by the side of our canoe to tell us that their great chief Ouasicoude, having learned that another chief of these people wished to pursue and kill us, and that he entered the cabin where he was consult ing, and had struck him on the head with such violence as to scatter his brains upon his associ ates ; thus preventing the executing of this inju rious project. The additions in his Utrecht book to magnify his importance and detract from others, are many. As Sparks and Parkman have pointed out the plagiarisms of this edition, a reference here is unnecessary. Du Luth, who left Quebec in 1678, and had been in northern Minnesota, with an interpreter, for a year, after he met Ako and Hennepin, be comes of secondary importance, in the eyes of the Franciscan. \" We regaled the three savages, having a great abundance of food at that time. The Sieur du Luth, after the savages had left, was as enraged as before, and feared that they would pursue and attack us on our voyage. He would have pushed In the Description of Louisiana, on page 289, Hennepin speaks of passing the Falls of Saint Anthony, upon his return to Canada, in these"], [41, "TRIBUTE TO DANIEL GREYSOLON DU LUTH. 27 the matter further, but seeing that one man would resist, and was not in the humor to be imposed upon, he moderated, and I appeased them in the end with the assurance that God would not aban don us in distress, and, provided we confided in Him, he would deliver us from our foes, because He is the protector of men and angels.\" de Frontenac, planting the arms of his Majesty in several nations on the right and left.\" In the second volume of his last book, which is called \" A Continuance of the New Discovery of a vast Country in America,\" etc., Hennepin no ticed some criticisms. To the objection that his work wTas dedicated to William the Third of Great Britain, he replies : \" My King, Iris most Catholic Majesty, his Elec toral Highness of Bavaria, the consent in waiting of the Superior of my order, the integrity of my faith, and the regular observance of my vows, which his Britannic Majesty allows me, are the best warrants of the uprightness of my inten tions.\" After describing a conference with the Sioux, he adds, \" Thus the savages were very kind, without mentioning the beaver robes. The chief Ouasicoude told me to offer a fathom of Marti nico tobacco to the chief Aquipaguetin, who had adopted me as a son. This had an admirable effect upon the barbarians, who went off shouting several times the word ' Louis,' [Ouis or We] which, as he said, means the sun. Without van ity, I must say that my name will be for a long time among these people. To the query, how he could travel so far upon the Mississippi in so httle time, he answers with a bold face, \" That we may, with a canoe and a pair of oars, go twenty, twenty-five, or thirty leagues every day, and more too, if there be oc casion. And though we had gone but ten leagues a day, yet in thirty days we might easily have gone three hundred leagues. If during the time we spent from the river of the Illinois to the mouth of the Meschasipi, in the Gulf of Mexico, we had used a httle more haste, we might have gone the same twice over.\" \"The savages having left us, to go to war against the Messorites, the Maroha, the Illinois, and other nations which live toward the lower part of the Mississippi, and are irreconcilable foes of the people of the North, the Sieur du Luth, who upon many occasions gave me marks of his friendship, could not forbear to tell our men that I had all the reason in the world to believe that the Viceroy of Canada would give me a favorable reception, should we arrive before winter, and that he wished with all his heart that he had been among as many natives as myself.\" To the objection, that he said, he nad passed eleven years in America, wiien he had been there but about four, he evasively replies, that \" reck oning from the year 1674, when I first set out, to the year 1688, when I printed the second edition of my ' Louisiana,' it appears that I have spent fifteen years either in travels or printing my Discoveries.\" The style of Louis Hennepin is unmistakable in this extract, and it is amusing to read his pa tronage of one of the fearless explorers of the Northwest, a cousin of Tonty, favored by Fron tenac, and who was in Minnesota a year before his arrival. To those who objected to the statement in his first book, in the dedication to Loins the Four teenth, that the Sioux always call the sun Louis, he writes : \" I repeat what I have said before, that being among the Issati and Nadouessans,by whom I was made a slave in America, I never heard them call the sun any other than Louis. It is true these savages call also the moon Louis, but with this distinction, that they give the moon the name of Louis Bastache, which in their lan guage signifies, the sun that shines in the night.\" In 1691, six years before the Utrecht edition of Hennepin, another Recollect Franciscan had pub lished a book at Paris, called \" The First Estab lishment of the Faith in New France,\" in which is the following tribute to Du Luth, whom Hen nepin strives to make a subordinate : \" In the last years of M. de Frontenac 's administration, Sieur DuLuth, a man of talent and experience, opened a way to the missionary and the Gospel in many different nations, turning toward the north of that lake [Superior] where he even built a fort, he advanced as far as the Lake of the Issati, called Lake Buade, from the family name of M. The Utrecht edition called forth much censure, and no one in France doubted that Hennepin was the author. D'lberville, Governor of Lou isiana, while in Paris, wrote on July 3d 1699, to"], [42, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 28 the Minister of Marine and Colonies of France, in these words : \" Very much vexed at the Rec ollect, whose false narratives had deceived every one, and caused our suffering and total failure of our enterprise, by the time consumed in the search of things which alone existed in his imag ination.\" * * * he makes Mr. de la Salle appear in his Relation, wounded with two balls in the head, turn toward the Recollect Father Anastase, to ask him for absolution, having been killed in stantly, without littering a word \u25a0 and other like false stories.\" Hennepin gradually faded out of sight. Bru net mentions a letter written by J. B. Dubos, from Rome, dated March 1st, 1701, which men tions that Hennepin was hving on the Capitoline Hill, in the celebrated convent of Ara C\u0153li, and was a favorite of Cardinal Spada. The time and place of his death has not been ascertained. The Rev. Father James Gravier, in a letter from a fort on the Gulf of Mexico, near the Mis sissippi, dated February 16th, 1701, expressed the sentiment of his times when he speaks of Hen nepin \" who presented to King William, the Rela tion of the Mississippi, where he never was, and after a thousand falsehoods and ridiculous boasts,"], [43, "NICHOLAS PEBBOT, FOUNDER OF FIBST POST ON LAKE PEPIN. 29 CHAPTER V.

Mississippi was reached, a party of Winnebagoes was employed to notify the tribes of Northern Iowa that the French had ascended the river, and wished to meet them. It was further agreed that prairie fires would be kindled from time to time, so that the Indians could follow the French. Nicholas Perrot, sometimes written Pere, was one of the most energetic of the class in Canada known as \"coureurs des bois,\" or forest rangers. Born in 1644, at an early age he was identified with the fur trade of the great inland lakes. As early as 1665, he was among the Outagamies [Foxes], and in 1667 was at Green Bay. In 1669, he was appointed by Talon to go to the lake re gion in search of copper mines. At the formal taking possession of that country in the name of the King of France, at Sault St. Marie, on the 14th of May, 1671, he acted as interpreter. In 1677, he seems to have been employed at Fort Frontenac. La Salle was made very sick the next year, from eating a salad, and one Nicholas Perrot, called Joly C\u0153ur (Jolly Soul) was sus pected of having mingled poison with the food. After this he was associated with Du Luth in the execution of two Indians, as we have seen. In 1684, he was appointed by De la Barre, the Governor of Canada, as Commandant for the West, and left Montreal with twenty men. Ar riving at Green Bay in Wisconsin, some Indians told him that they had visited countries toward the setting sun, where they obtained the blue and green stones suspended from their ears and noses, and that they saw horses and men hke Frenchmen, probably the Spaniards of New Mex ico ; and others said that they had obtained hatch ets from persons who lived in a house that walked on the water, near the mouth of the river of the Assiniboines, alluding to the English established at Hudson's Bay. Proceeding to the portage be tween the Fox and Wisconsin, thirteen Hurons were met, who were bitterly opposed to the es tablishment of a post near the Sioux. After the After entering Lake Pepin, near its mouth, on the east side, Perrot found a place suitable for a post, where there was wood. The stockade was built at the foot of a bluff beyond which was a large prairie. La Potherie makes this statement, which is repeated by Penicaut, who writes of Lake Pepin : \" To the right and left of its shores there are also prairies. In that on the right on the bank of the lake, there is a fort, which was built by Nicholas Perrot, whose name it yet [1700] bears.\" Soon after he was estabhshed, it was announced that a band of Aiouez [Ioways] was encamped above, and on the way to visit the post. The French ascended in canoes to meet them, but as they drew nigh, the Indian women ran up the bluffs, and hid in the woods ; but twenty of the braves mustered courage to advance and greet Perrot, and bore him to the chief's lodge. The chief, bending over Perrot, began to weep, and allowed the moisture to fall upon his visitor. After he had exhausted himself, the principal men of the party repeated the slabbering process. Then buffalo tongues were boiled in an earthen pot, and after being cut into small pieces, the chief took a piece, and, as a mark of respect, placed it in Perrot's mouth. During the winter of 1684-85, the French tra ded in Minnesota. At the end of the beaver hunt, the Ayoes [Ioways] came to the post, but Perrot was absent visiting the Nadouaissioux. and they sent a chief to notify him of their arrival. Four Illinois met him on the wyay, and were anxious for the return of four children held by the French. \"When the"], [44, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 30 me of your designs; you will take my things away and put me in the kettle, and proceed against the Nadouaissioux, The Spirit told me to be on my guard, and he would help me.\" At this they were astonished, and confessed that an attack was meditated. That night the chiefs slept in the stockade, and early the next morn ing a part of the hostile force was encamped in the vicinity, and wished to trade. Perrot had now only a force of fifteen men, and seizing the chiefs, he told them he would break their heads if they did not disperse the Indians. One of the chiefs then stood up on the gate of the fort and said to the warriors, \" Do not advance, young men, or you are dead. The Spirit has warned Metaminens [Perrot] of your designs.\" They fol lowed the advice, and afterwards Perrot presents ed them with twro guns, two kettles, and some tobacco, to close the door of war against the Na douaissioux, and the chiefs were all permitted to make a brief visit to the post. Sioux, who were at war with the Illinois, per ceived them, they wished to seize their canoes, but the French voyageurs who were guarding them, pushed into the middle of the river, and the French at the post coming to their assistance, a reconcihation was effected, and four of the Sioux took the Illinois upon their shoulders, and bore them to the shore. An order having been received from Denon ville, Governor of Canada, to bring the Miamis, and other tribes, to the rendezvous at Niagara, to go on an expedition against the Senecas, Per rot entrusting the post at Lake Pepin to a few Frenchmen, visited the Miamis, who were dwel ling below on the Mississippi, and with no guide but Indian camp fires, went sixty miles into the country beyond the river. Upon his return, he perceived a great smoke, and at first thought that it was a war party pro ceeding to the Sioux country. Fortunately he met a Maskouten chief, who had been at the post to see him, and he gave the intelligence, that the Outagamies [Foxes], Kikapous [Kickapoos], and Mascoutechs [Maskoutens], and others, from the region of Green Bay, had determined to pillage the post, kill the French, and then go to war against the Sioux. Hurrying on, he reached the fort, and learned that on that very day three spies had been there and seen that there were only six Frenchmen in charge. Returning to Green Bay in 1686, he passed much time in collecting allies for the expedition against the Iroquois in New York. During this year he gave to the Jesuit chapel at Depere, five miles above Green Bay, a church utensil of silver, fif teen inches high, still in existence. The stand ard, nine inches in height, supports a radiated circlet closed with glass on both sides and sur mounted with a cross. This vessel, weighing about twenty ounces, was intended to show the consecrated wafer of the mass, and is called a soleil, monstrance, or ostensorium. The next day two more spies appeared, but Perrot had taken the precaution to put loaded guns at the door of each hut, and caused his men frequently to change their clothes. To the query, \" How many French were there?\" the reply was given, \" Forty, and that more were daily expected, who had been on a buffalo hunt, and that the guns were well loaded and knives well sharpened.\" They were then told to go back to their camp aud bring a chief of each nation represented, and that if Indians, in large numbers, came near, they would be fired at. In accordance with this mes- sage six chiefs presented themselves, After their bows and arrows were taken away they were in- vited to Perrot's cabin, who gave something to eat and tobacco to smoke. Looking at Perrot's loaded guns they asked, '\u25a0 If he was afraid of his children?\" He replied, he was not. They con tinued, \" You are displeased.\" He answered, \" I have good reason to be.

Mississippi to the post which in 1684 he had erected, just above the mouth, and on the east side of Lake Pepin. During the spring of 1687 Perrot, with De Lu th and Tonty, was with the Indian allies and the French in the expedition against the Senecas of the Genessee Valley in New York. As soon as the rivers were navigable, the Na douaissioux came down and escorted Perrot to one of their villages, where he was welcomed with much enthusiasm. He was carried upon a beaver robe, followed by a long line of warriors, each bearing a pipe, and singing. After taking him around the village, he was borne to the chief's lodge, when several came in to weep over his head, with the same tenderness that the Ayoes (Ioways) did, when Perrot several years before arrived at Lake Pepin. \" These weepings,\" says an old chronicler \" do not weaken their souls. They are very good warriors, and reported the bravest in that region. They are at war with all the tribes at present except the Saulteurs [Chippeways] and Ayoes [Ioways], and even with these they have quarrels. At the break of day the Nadouaissioux bathe, even to the youngest. They have very fine forms, but the women are not comely, and they look upon them as slaves. They are jealous and suspicious about them, and they are the cause of quarrels and blood-shedding. The next year Denonville, Governor of Canada, again sent Perrot with forty Frenchmen to the Sioux who, says Potherie, \" were very distant, and who would not trade with us as easily as the other tribes, the Outagamis [Foxes] having boasted of having cut off the passage thereto.\" When Perrot arrived at Mackinaw, the tribes of that region were much excited at the hostility of the Outagamis [Foxes] toward the Sauteurs [Chippeways]. As soon as Perrot and his party reached Green Bay a deputation of the Foxes sought an interview. He told them that he had nothing to do with this quarrel with the Chippe ways. In justification, they said that a party of their young men, in going to war against the Nadouaissioux, had found a young man and three Chippeway girls. Perrot was silent, and continued his journey towards the Nadouaissioux. Soon he was met by five chiefs of the Foxes in a canoe, who begged him to go to their village. Perrot consented, and when he went into a chief's lodge they placed be fore him broiled venison, and raw meat for the rest of the French. He refused to eat because, said he, \"that meat did not give him any spirit, but he would take some when the Outagamis [Foxes] were more reasonable.\" He then eluded them for not having gone, as requested by the Governor of Canada, to the Detroit of Lake Erie, and during the absence of the French fight ing with the Chippeways. Having ordered them to go on their beaver hunt and only fight against the Iroquois, he left a few Frenchmen to trade and proceeded on his journey to the Sioux coun try. Arriving at the portage between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers they were impeded by ice, but with the aid of some Pottawattomies they trans ported their goods to the Wisconsin, which they found no longer frozen. The Chippeways were informed that their daughters had been taken from the Foxes, and a deputation came to take them back, but being attacked by the Foxes, who did not know their errand, they fled without se curing the three girls. Perrot then ascended the \" The Sioux are very dextrous with their ca noes, and they fight unto death if surrounded, Their country is full of swamps, which shelter them in summer from being molested.

Of this complaint was made, and the guilty leader was near being put to death by his associ ates. Amicable relations having been formed, preparations were made by Perrot to return to his post. As they were going away, one of the Frenchmen complained that a box of his goods had been stolen. Perrot ordered a voyageur to bring a cup of water, and into it he poured some brandy. He then addressed the Indians and told them he would dry up their marshes if the goods were not restored ; and then he set on fire the brandy in the cup, The savages were astonished and terrified, and supposed that he possessed su pernatural powers ; and in a little pWle the goods"], [46, "32 EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. border of the river St. Croix, and at the mouth of the river St. Pierre, on the bank of which were the Mantantans, and further up to the interior, as far as the Menchokatonx [Med-ay-wah-kawn twawn], with whom dwell the majority of the Songeskitons [Se-see-twawns] and other Nadou essioux who are to the northwest of the Missis sippi, to take possession, for and in the name of the King, of the countries and rivers inhabited by the said tribes, and of which they are proprietors. The present act done in our presence, signed with our hand, and subscribed.\" were found and restored to the owner, and the French descended to their stockade. The Foxes, while Perrot wras in the Sioux country, changed their village, and settled on the Mississippi. Coming up to visit Perrot, they asked him to establish friendly relations between them and the Sioux. At the time some Sioux were at the post trading furs, and at first they supposed the French were plotting with the Foxes. Perrot, however, eased them by present ing the calumet and saying that the French con sidered the Outagamis [Foxes] as brothers, and then adding: \"Smoke in my pipe; this is the manner with which Onontio [Governor of Can ada] feeds his children.\" The Sioux replied that they wished the Foxes to smoke first. This was reluctantly done, and the Sioux smoked, but would not conclude a definite peace until they consulted their chiefs. This was not concluded, because Perrot, before the chiefs came down, received orders to return to Canada. The three Chippeway girls of whom mention has been made were still with the Foxes, and Perrot took them with him to Mackinaw, upon his return to Canada. While there, the Ottawas held some prisoners upon an island not far from the mainland. The Jesuit Fathers went over and tried to save the captives from harsh treatment, but were unsuc cessful. The canoes appeared at length near each other, one man paddling in each, while the war riors were answering the shouts of the prisoners, who each held a white stick in his hand. As they neared the shore the chief of the party made a speech to the Indians who lived on the shore, and giving a history of the campaign, told them that they wrere masters of the prisoners. The warriors then came on land, and, according to custom, abandoned the spoils. An old man then ordered nine men to conduct the prisoners to a separate place. The women and the young men formed a line with big sticks. The young pris oners soon found their feet, but the old men were so badly used they spat blood, and they were con demned to be burned at the Mamilion. About this time, in the presence of Father Jo seph James Marest, a Jesuit missionary, Boisguil lot, a trader on the Wisconsin and Mississippi, Le Sueur, wlio afterward built a post below the Saint Croix River, about nine miles from Hastings, the following document was prepared: \" Nicholas Perrot, commanding for the King at the post of the Nadouessioux, commissioned by the Marquis Denonville, Governor and Lieuten ant Governor of all New France, to manage the interests of commerce among all the Indian tribes and people of the Bay des Puants [Green Bay], Nadouessioux, Mascoutens, and other western na tions of the Upper Mississippi, and to take pos session in the King's name of all the places where he has heretofore been and whither he will go: The Jesuit Fathers and the French officers were much embarrassed, and feared that the Iro quois would complain of the little care which had been used to prevent cruelty. \" We this day, the eighth of May, one thousand six hundred and eighty-nine, do, in the presence of the Reverend Father Marest, of the Society of Jesus, Missionary among the Nadouessioux, of Monsieur de Boisguillot, commanding the French in the neighborhood of the Ouiskonche, on the Mississippi, Augustin Legardeur, Esquire, Sieur de Caumont, and of Messieurs Le Sueur, Hebert, Lemire and Blein. Perrot, in this emergency, walked to the place where the prisoners were singing the death dirge. in expectation of being burned, and told them to sit down and be silent. A few Ottauwaws rudely told them to sing on, but Perrot forbade. He then went back to the Council, where the old men had rendered judgment, and ordered one prisoner to be burned at Mackinaw, one at Sault St. Marie and another at Green Bay. Undaunted he spoke as follows : \"I come to cut the strings of the \" Declare to all whom it may concern, that, be ing come from the Bay des Puants, and to the Lake of the Ouiskonches, we did transport our selves to the country of the Nadouessioux, on the"], [47, "PERROT VISITS THE LEAD MINES. 33 dogs.

Take care, that, if oyu swallow them, Onontio will tear them with violence from between your teeth. I speak as a brother, and I think I am showing pity to your children, by cutting the bonds of your prisoners.\" They arrested the massengers and came to the post for the purpose of plunder. Perrot asked them why they acted in this manner, and said that the Foxes, Miamis, Kickapoos, Illinois, and Maskoutens had united in a war party against them, but that he had persuaded them to give it up, and now he wished them to return to their families and to their beaver. The Sioux declared that they had started on the war-path, and that they were ready to die. After they had traded their furs, they sent for Perrot to come to their camp, and begged that he would not hinder them from searching for their foes. Perrot tried to dis suade them, but they insisted that the Spirit had given them men to eat, at three days' journey from the post Then more powerful influences were used. After giving them two kettles and some merchandise, Poerrt spoke thus: \" I love your life, and I am sure you will be defeated. Your Evil Spirit has deceived you. If you kill the Outagamis, or their allies, you must strike me first; if you kill them, you kill me just the same, for I hold them under one wing and you under the other.\" After this he extended the calumet, which they at first refused; but at length a chief said he was right, and, making invocations to the sun, wished Perrot to take him back to his arms. This was granted, on condition that he would give up his weapons of war. The chief then tied them to a pole in the centre of the fort, turning them toward the sun. He then persuaded the other chiefs to give up the expedition, and, send ing for Perrot, he placed the calumet before him, one end in the earth aud the other on a small forked twig to hold it firm. Then he took from his own sack a pair of his cleanest moccasins, and taking off Perrot's shoes, put on these. After he had made him eat, presenting the calumet, he said: \" We listen to you now. Do for us as you do for our enemies, and prevent them from kill ing us, and we will separate for the beaver hunt. The sun is the witness of our obedience.\" His boldness had the desired effect. The pris oners were released, and two of them were sent with him to Montreal, to be returned to the Iro quois. On the 22nd of May, 1690, with one hundred and forty-three voyageurs and six Indians, Per rot left Montreal as an escort of Sieur de Lou vigny La Porte, a half-pay captain, appointed to succeed Durantaye at Mackinaw, by Frontenac, the new Governor of Canada, who in October of the previous year had arrived, to take the place of Denonville. Perrot, as he approached Mackinaw, wrent in advance to notify the French of the coming of the commander of the post. As he came in sight of the settlement, he hoisted the white flag with the fleur de lis and the voyageurs shouted, \" Long live the king! \" Louvigny soon appeared and was received by one hundred \"coureur des bois\" under arms. From Mackinaw, Perrot proceeded to Green Bay, and a party of Miamis there begged him to make a trading establishment on the Mississippi towards the Ouiskonsing (Wisconsin.) The chief made him a present of a piece of lead from a mine which he had found in a small stream which flows into the Mississippi. Perrot promised to visit him within twenty days, and the chief then returned to his village below the d'Ouiskonche (iWsconsin) River. After this, Perrot descended the Mississippi and revealed to the Maskoutens, who had come to meet him, how he had pacified the Sionx. He, about this period, in accordance with his prom ise, visited the lead mines. He found the ore abundant \" but the lead hard to work because it lay between rocks which required blowing up. It had very little dross and was easily melted.\" Having at length reached his post on Lake Pepin, he was informed that the Sioux were forming a large war party against the Outaga mis (Foxes) and other alhes of the French. He gave notice of his arrival to a party of about four hundred Sioux who were on the Mississippi. 3"], [48, "34 EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA.

Perrot was ordered by Frontenac to es tablish a new post for the Miamis in Michigan, in the neighborhood of the Kalamazoo River. Two years later he is present again, in August, at a council in Montreal, then returned to the West, and in 1699 is recalled from Green Bay. In 1701 he was at Montreal acting as interpreter, and appears to have died before 1718: his wife was Madeline Raclos, and his residence was in the Seigneury of Becancourt, not far from Three Rivers, on the St. Lawrence.

Tliis is an observation that I made dur ing these three or four days that I passed here. The Sakis, the Poutouatamis, and a few of the Malominis have their villages on the border of this river, and the Jesuits have a house there. In the place there is carried on quite a commerce in furs and Indian corn, which the Indians traffic with the ' coureurs des bois' that go and come, for it is their nearest and most convenient passage to the Mississippi. The \" Travels \" of Baron La Hontan appeared in A. D. 1703, both at London and at Hague, and wrere as saleable and readable as those of Hennepin, which were on the counters of booksellers at the same time. La Hontan, a Gascon by birth, and in style of writing, when about seventeen years of age, ar rived in Canada, in 1683, as a private soldier, and was with Gov. De la Barre in his expedition of 1684, toward Niagara, and was also in the battle near Rochester, New York, in 1687, at which Du Luth and Perrot, explorers of Minnesota, were present. \" The lands here are very fertile, and produce, almost without culture, the wheat of our Europe, peas, beans, and any quantity of fruit unknown in France. \" The moment I landed, the warriors of three nations came by turns to my cabin to entertain me with the pipe and chief dance ; the first in proof of peace and friendship, the second to indi cate their esteem and consideration for me. In return, I gave them several yards of tobacco, and beads, with which they trimmed their capots. The next morning, I was asked as a guest, to one of the feasts of this nation, and after having sent my dishes, which is the custom, I went towards noon. They began to compliment me of my arrival, and after hearing them, they all, one after the other, began to sing and dance, in a manner that I will detail to you when I have more leisure. These songs and dances lasted two hours, and were sea soned with whoops of joy, and quibbles that they have woven into their ridiculous musique. Then the captives waited upon us. The whole troop were seated in the Oriental custom. Each one had his portion before him, like our monks in their refectories. They commenced by placing four dishes before me. The first consisted of two white fish simply boiled in water. The second was chopped meats with the boiled tongue of a bear ; the third a beaver's tail, all roasted. They made me drink also of a syrup, mixed with water, made out of the maple tree. The feast lasted two In 1688 he appears to have been sent to Fort St. Joseph, which was built by Du Luth, on the St. Clare River, near the site of Fort Gratiot, Michigan. It is possible that he may have accom panied Perrot to Lake Pepin, who came about this time to reoccupy his old post. From the following extracts it will be seen that his style is graphic, and that he probably had been in 1688 in the valley of the Wisconsin. At Mack inaw, after his return from his pretended voyage of the Long River, he writes: \" I left here on the 24th September, with my men and five Outaouas, good hunters, whom I have before mentioned to you as having been of good service to me. All my brave men being provided with good canoes, filled with provisions and ammunition, together with goods for the In dian trade, I took advantage of a north wind, and in three days entered the Bay of the Pouteouata mis, distant from here about forty leagues. The entrance to the bay is full of islands. It is ten leagues wide and twenty-five in length. \" On the 29th we entered a river, which is quite deep, whose waters are so affected by the lake that they often rise and fall three feet in twelve"], [50, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 36 hours, after which, I requested a chief of the nation to sing for me ; for it is the custom, when we have business with them, to employ an inferior for self in all the ceremonies they perform.

The next day and the day following, I attended the feasts of the other nations, where I observed the same formalities.\" ocean; that the Indians say that they have seen bearded men with caps, who gather gold-dust on the seashore, but that it is very far from this country, and that they pass through many nations unknown to the French. \" I have a memoir of La Motte Cadillac, form erly Governor of Missilimackinack, who says that if St. Peters [MinnesotaJ River is ascended to its source they will, according to all appearance, find in the highland another river leading to the West ern Ocean. He alleges that, on the 23d of October, he reached the Mississippi River, and, ascending, on the 3d of November he entered into a river, a tributary from the west, that was almost without a current, and at its mouth filled with rushes. He then describes a journey of five hundred miles up this stream. He declares he found upon its banks three great nations, the Eokoros, Essa napes, and Gnacsitares, and because he ascended it for sixty days, he named it Long River. \"For the last two years I have tormented exceedingly the Governor-General, M. Raudot, and M. Duche, to move them to discover this ocean. If I succeed, as I hope, we shall hear tidings before three years, and I shall have the pleasure and the consolation of having rendered a good service to Geography, to Religion and to the State.\" For years his wondrous story was believed, and geographers hastened to trace it upon their maps. But in time the voyage up the Long River was discovered to be a fabrication. There is extant a letter of Bobe, a Priest of the Congregation of the Mission, dated Versailles, March 15, 1716, and addressed to De LTsle, the geographer of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, which exposes the deception. Charlevoix, in his History of New France, al luding to La Hontan 's voyage, writes: \" The voyage up the Long River is as fabulous as the Island of Barrataria, of which Sancho Panza was governor. Nevertheless, in France and else where, most people have received these memoirs as the fruits of the travels of a gentleman who wrote badly, although quite lightly, and who had no religion, but who described pretty sincerely what he had seen. The consequence is that the compilers of historical and geographical diction aries have almost always followed and cited them in preference to more faithful records.\" He writes: \"It seems to me that you might give the name of Bourbonia to these vast coun tries which are between the Missouri, Mississippi, and the Western Ocean. Would it not be well to efface that great river which La Hontan says he discovered? Even in modern times, Nicollet, employed by the United States to explore the Upper Mississ ippi, has the following in his report: \"All the Canadians, and even the Governor General, have told me that this river is unknown. If it existed, the French, who are on the Illinois, and at Ouabache, would know of it. The last volume of the ' Lettres Edifiantes' of the Jesuits, in which there is a very fine relation of the Illinois Country, does not speak of it, any more than the letters which I received this year, which tell won ders of the beauty and goodness of the country. They send me some quite pretty work, made by the wife of one of the principal chiefs. \"Having procured a copy of La Hontan's book, in which there is a roughly made map of his Long River, I was struck with the resem blance of its course as laid down with that of Cannon River, which I had previously sketched in my own field-book. I soon convinced myself that the principal statements of the Baron in ref erence to the country and the few details he gives of the physical character of the the river, coin cide remarkably with what I had laid down as belonging to Cannon River. Then the lakes and swamps corresponded; traces of Indian villages mentioned by him might be found by a growth of wild grass that propagates itself around all old Indian settlements.\" \" They tell me, that among the Scioux, of the Mississippi, there are always Frenchmen trading; that the course of the Mississippi is from north to west, and from west to south; that it is known that toward the source of the Mississippi there is a river in the highlands that leads to the western"], [51, "LE SUEUR, EXPLORER OF THE MINNESOTA RIVER. 37 CHAPTER vn.

Le Sueur was a native of Canada, and a rela tive of D'lberville, the early Governor of Louis iana. He came to Lake Pepin in 1683, with Nicholas Perrot, and his name also appears at tached to the document prepared in May, 1689, after Perrot had re-occupied his post just above the entrance of the lake, on the east side. On the fifteenth of July, 1695, Le Sueur arrived at Montreal with a party of Ojibways, and the first Dakotah brave that had ever visited Canada. The Indians were much impressed with the power of France by the marching of a detach ment of seven hundred picked men, under Chev alier Cresafi, who were on their way to La Chine. In 1692, he was sent by Governor Frontenac of Canada, to La Pointe, on Lake Superior, and in a dispatch of 1693, to the French Government, is the following : \"Le Sueur, another voyageur, is to remain at Chagouamagon [La Pointe] to en deavor to maintain the peace lately concluded be tween the Saulteurs [Chippeways] and Sioux. This is of the greatest consequence, as it is now the sole pass by which access can be had to the latter nation, whose trade is very profitable ; the country to the south being occupied by the Foxes and Maskoutens, who several times plundered the French, on the ground they were carrying ammu nition to the Sioux, their ancient enemies.\" On the eighteenth, Frontenac, in the presence of Callieres and other persons of distinction, gave them an audience. The first speaker was the chief of the Ojibway band at La Pointe, Shingowahbay, who said: \" That he was come to pay his respects to Onon tio [the title given the Governor of Canada] in the name of the young warriors of Point Chagouami gon, and to thank him for having given them some Frenchmen to dwell with them; to testify their sorrow for one Jobin, a Frenchman, who was killed at a feast, accidentally, and not ma liciously. AVe come to ask a favor of you, which is to let us act. We are allies of the Sciou. Some Outagamies, or Mascoutins, have been killed. The Sciou came to mourn with us. Let us act, Father; let us take revenge. Entering the Sioux country in 1694, he estab hshed a post upon a prairie island in the Missis sippi, about nine miles below the present town of Hastings, according to Bellin and others. Peni caut, who accompanied him in the exploration of the Minnesota, writes, \" At the extremity of the lake [Pepin] you come to the Isle Pelee, so called because there are no trees on it. It is on this island \" Le Sueur alone, who is acquainted with the language of the one and the other, can serve us. We ask that he return with us.\""], [52, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 38 Another speaker of the Ojibways was Le Bro- sures me of his protection, and I promise him that if he condescends to restore my children, now prisoners among the Foxes, Ottawas and Hurons, I will return hither, and bring with me the twen ty-two villages whom he has just restored to life by promising to send them Iron.\" chet. Teeoskahtay, the Dahkotah chief, before he spoke, spread out a beaver robe, and, laying an other with a tobacco pouch and otter skin, began to weep bitterly. After drying his tears, he said: \" All of the nations had a father, who afforded them protection; all of them have iron. B\"t he was a bastard in quest of a father; he was come to see him, and hopes that he will take pity on him.\" On the 14th of August, two weeks after the Ojibway chief left for his home on Lake Superior, Nicholas Perrot arrived with a deputation of Sauks, Foxes, Menomonees, Miamis of Maramek and Pottowatomies. Two days after, they had a council with the governor, who thus spoke to a Fox brave: He then placed upon the beaver robe twenty two arrows, at each arrow naming a Dahkotah village that desired Frontenac 's protection. Re suming his speech, he remarked: \" I see that you are a young man; your nation has quite turned away from my wishes; it has pillaged some of my young men, whom it has treated as slaves. I know that your father, who loved the French, had no hand in the indignity. You only imitate the example of your father who had sense, when you do not co-operate with those of your tribe who are wishing to go over to my enemies, after they grossly insulted me and defeated the Sioux, whom I now consider my son. I pity the Sioux; I pity the dead whose loss I deplore. Perrot goes up there, and he will speak to your nation from me for the release of their prisoners; let them attend to him.\" \"It is not on account of what I bring that I hope him who rules the earth will have pity on me. I learned from the Sauteurs that he wanted nothing; that he was the Master of the Iron; that he had a big heart, into which he could receive all the nations. This has induced me to abandon my people and come to seek his protection, and to beseech bim to receive me among the number of his children. Take courage, Great Captain, and reject me not; despise me not, though I ap pear poor in your eyes. All the nations here present know that I am rich, and the httle they offer here is taken from my lands.\" Teeoshkahtay never returned to his native land. While in Montreal he was taken sick, and in thirty-three days he ceased to breathe; and, fol lowed by white men, his body was interred in the white man's grave. Count Frontenac in reply told the chief that he would receive the Dahkotahs as his children, on condition that they would be obedient, and that he would send back Le Sueur with him. Teeoskahtay, taking hold of the governor's knees, wept, and said: \"Take pity on us; we are well aware that wre are not able to speak, be ing children; but Le Sueur, who understands our language, and has seen all our villages, will next year inform you what will have been achieved by the Sioux nations represented by those arrows be fore you.\" Le Sueur instead of going back to Minnesota that year, as was expected, went to France and received a hcense, in 1697, to open certain mines supposed to exist in Minnesota. The ship in which he was returning was captured by the Eng lish, and he was taken to England. After his release he went back to France, and, in 1698, ob tained a new commission for mining. Having finished, a Dahkotah woman, the wife of a great chief whom Le Sueur had purchased from captivity at Mackinaw, approached those in authority, and, with downcast eyes, embraced their knees, weeping and saying: While Le Sueur was in Europe, the Dahkotas waged war against the Foxes and Miamis. In retaliation, the latter raised a war party and en tered the land of the Dahkotahs. Finding their foes intrenched, and assisted by \" coureurs des bois,\" they w*ere indignant; and on their return they had a skirmish with some Frenchmen, who were carrying goods to the Dahkotahs. \" I thank thee, Father; it is by thy means I have been liberated, and am no longer captive.\" Then Teeoskahtay resumed: \" I speak like a man penetrated with joy.

In the month of December he arrived from France, with thirty workmen, to proceed to the supposed mines in Minnesota. On the thirteenth of July, 1700, with a felucca, two canoes, and nineteen men, having ascended the Mississippi, he had reached the mouth of the Missouri, and six leagues above this he passed the Illinois. He there met three Canadians, who came to join him, with a letter from Father Mar est, who had once attempted a mission among the Dahkotahs, dated July 13, Mission Immaculate Conception of the Holy Virgin, in Illinois. \" I have the honor to write, in order to inform you that the Saugiestas have been defeated by the Scioux and Ayavois [Iowas]. The people have formed an alliance with the Quincapous [Kicka poos], some of the Mecoutins, Renards [Foxes], and Metesigamias, and gone to revenge them selves, not on the Scioux, for they are too much afraid of them, but perhaps on the Ayavois, or very likely upon the Paoutees, or more probably upon the Osages, for these suspect nothing, and the others are on their guard. \" This would be very desirable, in consequence of the great difficulty there will be in constraining them to it, should they be inclined to lift the mask altogether and become buccaneers; or should Sieur Le Sueur, as he easily could do, furnish them with goods for their beaver and smaller peltry, which he might send down by the return of other Frenchmen, whose sole desire is to obey, and who have remained only because of the impossi- bility of getting their effects down. This would rather induce those who would continue to lead a vagabond life to remain there, as the goods they would receive from Le Sueur's people would afford them the means of doing so.\" \" As you wdl probably meet these alhed na tions, you ought to take precaution against their plans, and not allow them to board your vessel, since they are traitors, and utterly faithless. I pray God to accompany you in all your designs.\" Twenty-two leagues above the Illinois, he passed a small stream which he called the River of Oxen, and nine leagues beyond this he passed a smaU river on the west side, where he met four Cana dians descending the Mississippi, on their way to the Illinois. On the 30th of July, nine leagues above the last-named river, he met seventeen Scioux, in seven canoes, who were going to re- In reply to this communication, Louis XIV. answered that \u2014 \" His majesty has approved that the late Sieur de Frontenac and De Champigny suspended the"], [54, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 40 a league. The half of this portage is shaking ground, and at the end of it is a small river which descends into a bay called Winnebago Bay. It is inhabited by a great number of nations who carry their furs to Canada. Monsieur Le Sueur came by the Wisconsin river to the Mississippi, for the first time, in 1683, on his way to the Scioux coun try, where he had already passed seven years at different periods. The Mississippi, opposite the mouth of the Wisconsin, is less than half a mile wide. From the 1st of September to the 5th, our voyageur advanced fourteen leagues. He passed the river \" Aux Canots,\" which comes from the northeast, and then the Quincapous, named from a nation which once dwelt upon its banks. venge the death of three Scioux, one of whom had been burned, and the others killed, at Tamarois, a few days before his arrival in that village. As he had promised the chief of the Illinois to ap pease the Scioux who should go to war against his nation, he made a present to the chief of the party to engage bim to turn back. He told them the King of France did not wish them to make this river more bloody, and that he was sent to tell them that, if they obeyed the king's word, they would receive in future all things necessary for them. The chief answered that he accepted the present, that is to say, that he would do as had been told him. From the 30th of July to the 25th of August, Le Sueur advanced fifty-three and one-fourth leagues to a small river which he called the River of the Mine. At the mouth it runs from the north, but it turns to the northeast. On the right seven leagues, there is a lead mine in a prairie, one and a half leagues. The river is only navigable in high water, that is to say, from early spring till the month of June. From the 5th to the 9th he made ten and a half leagues, and passed the rivers Cachee and Aux Ailes. The same day he perceived canoes, filled with savages, descending the river, and the five Canadians recognized them as the party who had robbed them. They placed sentinels in the wood, for fear of being surprised by land, and when they had approached within hearing, they cried to them that if they approached farther they would fire. They then drew up by an island, at half the distance of a gun shot. Soon, four of the princi pal men of the band approached in a canoe, and asked if it was forgotten that they were our brethren, and with what design we had taken arms when we perceived them. Le Sueur replied that he had cause to distrust them, since they had robbed five of his party. Nevertheless, for the surety of his trade, being forced to be at peace with all the tribes, he demanded no redress for the robbery, but added merely that the king, their master and his, wished that his subjects should navigate that river without insult, and that they had better beware how they acted. From the 25th to the 27th he made ten leagues, passed two small rivers, and made himself ac quainted with a mine of lead, from which he took a supply. From the 27th to the 30th he made eleven and a half leagues, and met five Canadians, one of whom had been dangerously wounded in the head. They were naked, and had no ammu nition except a miserable gun, with five or six loads of powder and balls. They said they were descending from the Scioux to go to Tamarois, and, when seventy leagues above, they perceived nine canoes in the Mississippi, in which were ninety savages, who robbed and cruelly beat them. This party were going to war against the Scioux, and were composed of four different nations, the Outagamies [Foxes], Poutouwatamis [Pottowatta mies], and Puans [Winnebagoes], who dwell in a country eighty leagues east of the Mississippi from where Le Sueur then was. The Indian who had spoken was silent, but an other said they had been attacked by the Scioux, and that if they did not have pity on them, and give them a little powder, they should not be able to reach their villages. The consideration of a missionary, who was to go up among the Scioux, and whom these savages might meet, induced them to give two pounds of powder. ' The Canadians determined to follow the detach ment, which was composed of twenty-eight men. This day they made seven and a half leagues. On the 1st of September he passed the Wisconsin river. It runs into the Mississippi from the north east. It is nearly one and a half miles wide. At about seventy-five leagues up this river, on the right, ascending, there is a portage of more than M. Le Sueur made the same day three leagues; passed a stream on the west, and afterward an other river on the east, which is navigable at all times, and which the Indians call Red River."], [55, "RATTLESNAKES ON SHORES OF LAKE PEPIN. 41 On the 10th, at daybreak, they heard an elk whistle, on the other side of the river. A Cana dian crossed in a small Scioux canoe, which they had found, and shortly returned with the body of the animal, which wras very easily killed, \" quand il est en rut,\" that is, from the beginning of Sep tember until the end of October. The hunters at this time made a whistle of a piece of wood, or reed, and when they hear an elk whistle they an swer it. The animal, believing it to be another elk, approaches, and is killed with ease. miles long. In these are found several caves, to, which the bears retire in winter. Most of the caverns are more than seventy feet in extent, and two hundred feet high. There are several of which the entrance is very narrow, and quite closed up with saltpetre, It would be dangerous to enter them in summer, for they are filled with rattlesnakes, the bite of which is very dangerous. Le Sueur saw some of these snakes which were six feet in length, but generally they are about four feet. They have teeth resembling those of the pike, and their gums are full of small vessels. in which their poison is placed. The Scioux say they take it every morning, and cast it away at night. They have at the tail a kind of scale which makes a noise, and this is ealled the rattle. From the 10th to the 14th, M. Le Sueur made seventeen and a half leagues, passing the rivers Raisin and Paquilenettes (perhaps the Wazi Ozu and Buffalo.) The same day he left, on the east side of the Mississippi, a beautiful and large river, which descends from the very far north, and called Bon Secours (Chippeway), on accoimt of the great quantity of buffalo, elk, bears and deers winch are found there. Three leagues up this river there is a mine of lead, and seven leagues above, on the same side, they found another long river, in the vicinity of which there is a copper mine, from which he had taken a lump of sixty pounds in a former voyage. In order to make these mines of any account, peace must be ob tained between the Scioux and Ouatagamis (Fox es), because the latter, who dwell on the east side of the Mississippi, pass this road continually when going to war against the Sioux. Le Sueur made on this day seven and a half leagues, and passed another river, called Hiam bouxecate Ouataba, or the River of Flat Rock. [The Sioux call the Cannon river Inyanbosndata.] On the 15th he crossed a small river, and saw in the neighborhood several canoes, filled with Indians, descending the Mississippi. He sup posed they were Scioux, because he could not dis tinguish whether the canoes were large or small. The arms were placed in readiness, and soon they heard the cry of the savages, which they are ac customed to raise when they rush upon their en emies. He caused them to be answered in the same manner; and after having placed all the men behind the trees, he ordered them not to fire until they were commanded. He remained on shore to see what movement the savages would make, and perceiving that they placed two on shore, on the other side, where from an eminence they could ascertain the strength of his forces, he caused the men to pass and repass from the shore to the wood, in order to make them believe that they were numerous. This ruse succeeded, for as soon as the two descended from the eminence the chief of the party came, bearing the calumet, which is a signal of peace among the Indians. They said that having never seen the French navi gate the river with boats like the felucca, they had supposed them to be Enghsh, and for that reason they had raised the war cry, and arranged them selves on the other side of the Mississippi; but having recognized their flag, they had come with out fear to inform them, that one of their num ber, who was crazy, had accidentally killed a Penicaut, in his journal, gives a brief descrip tion of the Mississippi between the Wisconsin and Lake Pepin. He writes: \"Above the Wis consin, and ten leagues higher on the same side, begins a great prairie extending for sixty leagues along the bank; this prairie is called Aux Ailes. Opposite to Aux Ailes, on the left, there is another prairie facing it called Paquilanet which is not so long by a great deal. Twenty leagues above these prairies is found Lake Bon Secours \" [Good Help, now Pepin.] In this region, at one and a half leagues on the northwest side, commenced a lake, which is six leagues long and more than one broad, called Lake Pepin.

The Frenchman they brought was Denis, a Ca nadian, and he reported that his companion was accidentally killed. His name was Laplace, a de serting soldier from Canada, who had taken ref uge in this country. Le Sueur rephed, that Onontio (the name they give to all the governors of Canada), being their father and his, they ought not to seek justification elsewhere than before him; and he advised them to go and see him as soon as possible, and beg him to wipe off the blood of this Frenchman from their faces. Having finished their speech, they leaned over the head of Le Sueur, according to their custom, crying out, \"Ouaechissou ouaepanimanabo,\" that is to say, \" Have pity upon us.\" Le Sueur had foreseen that the estabhshment of Blue Earth river would not please the Scioux of the East, who were, so to speak, masters of the other Scioux and of the nations which will be hereafter men tioned, because they were the first with whom trade was commenced, and in consequence of which they had already quite a number of guns. The party was composed of forty-seven men of different nations, who dwell far to the east, about the forty-fourth degree of latitude. Le Sueur, discovering who the chiefs were, said the king whom they had spoken of in Canada, had sent him to take possession of the north of the river; and that he wished the nations who dwell on it, as well as those under his protection, to live in peace. As he had commenced his operations not only with a view to the trade of beaver but also to gain a knowledge of the mines which he had pre viously discovered, he told them that he was sor ry that he had not known their intentions sooner, and that it was just, since he came expressly for them, that he should establish himself on their land, but that the season was too far advanced for him to return. He then made them a present of powder, balls and knives, and an armful of to bacco, to entice them to assemble, as soon as pos sible, near the fort he was about to construct, that when they should be all assembled he might tell them the intention of the king, their and his sovereign. He made this day three and three-fourths leagues; and on the 16th of September, he left a large river on the east side, named St. Croix, be cause a Frenchman of that name was shipwrecked at its mouth. It comes from the north-northwest. Four leagues higher, in going up, is found a small lake, at the mouth of which is a very large mass of copper. It is on the edge of the water, in a small ridge of sandy earth, on the west of this lake. [One of La Salle 's men was named St. Croix.] From the 16th to the 19th, he advanced thir teen and three-fourths leagues. After having made from Tamarois two hundred and nine and a half leagues, he left the navigation of the Missis sippi, to enter the river St. Pierre, on the west side. By the 1st of October, he had made in this river forty-four and one-fourth leagues. After he entered Blue river, thus named on account of the mines of blue earth found at its mouth, he found ed his post, situated in forty-four degrees, thir teen minutes north latitude. He met at this place nine Scioux, who told him that the river belonged to the Scioux of the west, the Ayavois (Iowas) and Otoctatas (Ottoes), who lived a little farther off; that it was not their custom to hunt The Scioux of the West, according to the state ment of the Eastern Scioux, have more than a thousand lodges. They do not use canoes, nor cultivate the earth, nor gather wild rice. They remain generally on the prairies which are be tween the Upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers, and hve entirely by the chase. The Scioux gen erally say they have three souls, and that after death, that which has done well goes to the warm country, that which has done evil to the cold regions, and the other guards the body. Poly gamy is common among them. They are very jealous, and sometimes fight in duel for their wives. They manage the bow admirably, and have been seen several times to kill ducks on the"], [57, "BLUE EARTH ASSAYED BY L'HULLIER IN PARIS. 43 whig. They make their lodges of a number of buffalo skins interlaced and sewed, and carry them wherever they go. They are all great smo kers, but their manner of smoking differs from that of other Indians. There are some Scioux who swallow all the smoke of the tobacco, and others who, after having kept it some time in their mouth, cause it to issue from the nose. In each lodge there are usually two or three men with their families. to them, they wept and repeated, according to custom, \" Ouaechissou ! ouaepanimanabo I\" Le Sueur told them to cease crying, and added that the French had good hearts, and that they had come into the country to have pity on them. At the same time he made them a present, saying to them, \" Carry back your beavers and say to all the Scioux, that they will have from me no more powder or lead, and they will no longer smoke any long pipe until they have made satisfaction for robbing the Frenchman. On the third of October, they received at the fort several Scioux, among whom was Wahkan tape, chief of the village. Soon two Canadians arrived who had been hunting, and who had been robbed by the Scioux of the East, who had raised their guns against the establishment which M. Le Sueur had made on Blue Earth river. The same day the Canadians, who had been sent off on the 22d, arrived without having found the road which led to the Ayavois and Otoctatas. On the 25th, Le Sueur went to the river with three canoes, which he filled with green and blue earth. It is taken from the hills near which are very abundant mines of copper, some of which was worked at Paris in 1696, by L'lluillier, One of the chief collectors of the king. Stones were also found there which would be curious, if worked. On the fourteenth the fort was finished and named Fort L'Huillier, and on the twenty-second two Canadians were sent out to invite the Aya vois and Otoctatas to come and establish a vil lage near the fort, because these Indians are in dustrious and accustomed to cultivate the earth, and they hoped to get provisions from them, and to make them work in the mines. On the ninth of November, eight Mantanton Scioux arrived, who had been sent by their chiefs to say that the Mendeoucantons were still at their lake on the east of the Mississippi, and they could not come for a long time ; and that for a single village which had no good sense, the others ought not to bear the punishment ; and that they were willing to make reparation if they knew how. Le Sueur replied tbat he was glad that they had a disposition to do so. On the twenty-fourth, six Scioux Oujalespoi tons wished to go into the fort, but were told that they did not receive men who had killed Frenchmen. This is the term used when they have insulted them. The next day they came to the lodge of Le Sueur to beg him to have pity on them. They wished, according to custom, to weep over his head and make him a present of packs of beavers, which he refused. He told them he was surprised that people who had rob bed should come to him ; to which they replied that they had heard it said that two Frenchmen had been robbed, but none from their village had been present at that wicked action. On the 15th the two Mantanton Scioux, who had been sent expressly to say that all of the Scioux of the east, and part of those of the west, were joined together to come to Jhe French, be cause they had heard that the Christianaux and the Assinipoils were making war on them. These two nations dwell above the fort on the east side, more than eighty leagues on the Upper Mississippi. Le Sueur answered, that he knew it was the Mendeoucantons and not the Oujalespoitons ; \" but,\" continued he, \" you are Scioux ; it is the Scioux who have robbed me, and if I were to fol low your manner of acting I should break your heads ; for is it not true, that when a stranger (it is thus they call the Indians who are not Scioux) has insulted a Scioux, Mendeoucanton, Oujalespoitons, or others\u2014 all the villages revenge upon the first one they meet?\" The Assinipoils speak Scioux, and are certainly of that nation. It is only a few years since that they became enemies. The enmity thus origi nated: The Christianaux, having the use of arms before the Scioux, through the English at Hud son's Bay, they constantly warred upon the As sinipoils, who were their nearest neighbors. The latter, being weak, sued for peace, and to render it more lasting, married the Christianaux As they had nothing to answer to what he said"], [58, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 44 The next day, he assembled in the fort the principal men of both villages; and as it is not possible to subdue the Scioux or to hinder them from going to war, unless it be by inducing them to cultivate the earth, he said to them that if they wished to render themselves worthy of the protection of the king, they must abandon their erring life, and form a village near his dwelling, where they would be shielded from the insults of of their enemies; and that they might be happy and not hungry, he would give them all the corn necessary to plant a large piece of ground; that the king, their and his chief, in sending him, had forbidden him to purchase beaver skins, knowing that this kind of hunting separates them and ex poses them to their enemies; and that in conse quence of this he had come to establish himself on Blue River and vicinity, where they had many times assured him were many kinds of beasts, for the skins of which he would give them all things necessary; that they ought to reflect that they could not do without French goods, and that the only way not to want them was, not to go to war with our allied nations. women. The other Scioux, who had not made the compact, continued the war; and, seeing some Christianaux with the Assinipoils, broke their heads. The Christianaux furnished the Assini poils with arms and merchandise. On the 16th the Scioux returned to their vil lage, and it was reported that the Ayavois and Otoctatas were gone to establish themselves to wards the Missouri River, near the Maha, who dwell in that region. On the 26th the Mantan tons and Oujalespoitons arrived at the fort; and, after they had encamped in the woods, Wah kantape came to beg Le Sueur to go to his lodge. He there found sixteen men with women and children, with their, faces daubed with black. In the middle of the lodge were several buffalo skins which were sewed for a carpet. After mo tioning him to sit down, they wept for the fourth of 'an hour, and the chief gave him some wild rice to eat (as was their custom), putting the first three spoonsful to his mouth. After which, he said all present were relatives of Tioscate, whom Le Sueur took to Canada in 1695, and who died there in 1696. At the mention of Tioscate they began to weep again, and wipe their tears and heads upon the shoulders of Le Sueur. Then Wahkantape again spoke, and said that Tioscate begged him to for get the insult done to the Frenchmen by the Mendeoucantons, and take pity on his brethren by giving them powder and balls whereby they could defend themselves, and gain a living for their wives and children, who languish in a coun try full of game, because they had not the means of killing them. \" Look,\" added the chief, \" Be hold thy children, thy brethren, and thy sisters; it is to thee to see whether thou wishest them to die. They will live if thou givest them powder and ball; they will die if thou refusest.\" As it is customary with the Indians to accom pany their word with a present proportioned to the affair treated of, he gave them fifty pounds of powder, as many balls, six guns, ten axes, twelve armsful of tobacco, and a hatchet pipe. On the first of December, the Mantantons in vited Le Sueur to a great feast. Of four of their lodges they had made one, in which were one hundred men seated around, and every one his dish before him. After the meal, Wahkantape, the chief, made them all smoke, one after another, in the hatchet pipe which had been given them. He then made a present to Le Sueur of a slave and a sack of wild rice, and said to him, showing him his men: \" Behold the remains of this great village, which thou hast aforetimes seen so nu merous! All the others have been killed in war; and the few men whom thou seest in this lodge, accept the present thou hast made them, and are resolved to obey the great chief of all nations, of whom thou hast spoken to us. Thou oughtest not to regard us as Scioux, but as French, and in stead of saying the Scioux are miserable, and have no mind, and are fit for nothing but to rob and steal from the French,-thou shalt say my breth ren are miserable and have no mind, and we must Le Sueur granted them their request, but as the Scioux never answer on the spot, especially in matters of importance, and as he had to speak to them about his establishment he went out of the lodge without saying a word. The chief and all those within followed him as far as the door of the fort; and when he had gone in, they went around it three times, crying with all their strength, \" Atheouanan! \" that is to say, \" Father, have pity on us.\" [Ate unyanpi, means Our Father.]"], [59, "D'lBERVILLE'S MEMOIR ON THE MISSISSIPPI TRIBES. 45 try to procure some for them.

Having finished his speech, he covered his face with his garment, and the others imitated him. They wept over their companions who had died in war, and chanted an adieu to their country in a tone so gloomy, that one could not keep from partaking of their sorrow. The above catalogue of villages concludes the extract that La Harpe has made from Le Sueur's journal. In the narrative of Major Long's second expe dition, there are just as many villages of the Gens du Lac, or M'dewakantonwan Scioux mentioned, though the names are different. After leaving the Mille Lac region, the divisions evidently were different, and the villages known by new names. Wahkantape then made them smoke again, and distributed the presents, and said that he was go ing to the Mendeoucantons, to inform them of the resolution, and invite them to do the same. Charlevoix, who visited the valley of the Lower Mississippi in 1722, says that Le Sueur spent a winter in his fort on the banks of the Blue Earth, and that in the following April he went up to the mine, about a mile above. In twenty-two days they obtained more than thirty thousand pounds of the substance, four thousand of which were se lected and sent to France. On the twelfth, three Mendeoucauton chiefs, and a large number of Indians of the same vil lage, arrived at the fort, and the next day gave satisfaction for robbing the Frenchmen. They brought four hundred pounds of beaver skins, and promised that the summer following, after their canoes were built and they had gathered their wild rice, that they would come and estabhsh themselves near the French. The same day they returned to their village east of the Mississippi. On the tenth of February, 1702, Le Sueur came back to the post on the Gulf of Mexico, and found D'lberville absent, who, however, arrived on the eighteenth of the next month, with a ship from France, loaded with supplies. After a few weeks, the Governor of Louisiana sailed again for the old country, Le Sueur being a fellow passenger. NAMES OF THE BANDS OF SCIOUX OF THE EAST, WITH THEIR SIGNIFICATION.

It is important that the commandant of the Mississippi should have a report of those who inhabit the rivers that fall into the Mississippi, and principally those of the river Illinois. \" The Canadians intimate to the savages that they ought not to listen to us but to the governor of Canada, who always speaks to them with large presents, that the governor of Mississippi is mean and never sends them any thing. This is true, and what I cannot do. It is imprudent to accus tom the savages to be spoken to by presents, for, with so many, it would cost the king more than the revenue derived from the trade. When they come to us, it will be necessary to bring them in subjection, make them no presents, and compel them to do what we wish, as if they were French men. \" The Spaniards have divided the Indians into parties on this point, and we can do the same.

We had a good deal of trouble the first two weeks in ac customing ourselves to it, having fever and di arrh\u0153a and becoming so tired of it as to hate the smell. But by degrees our bodies became adapt ed to it so well that at the end of six weeks there was not one of us who could not eat six pounds of meat a day, and drink four bowls of broth. As soon as we were accustomed to this kind of living it made us very fat, and then there was no more sickness. \" The Illinois and Mascoutens have detained the French canoes they find upon the Mississippi, saying that the governors of Canada have given them permission. I do not know whether this is so, but if true, it follows that we have not the liberty to send any one on the Mississippi. \"M. Le Sueur would have been taken if he had not been the strongest. Only one of the canoes he sent to the Sioux was plundered.\" * * * \" When spring arrived we went to work in the copper mine. This was the beginning of April of this year [1701.] We took with us twelve labor ers and four hunters. This mine was situated about three-quarters of a league from our post. We took from the mine in twenty days more than twenty thousand pounds weight of ore, of which we only selected four thousand pounds of the finest, which M. Le Sueur, who was a very good judge of it, had carried to the fort, and which has since been sent to France, though I have not learned the result. Penicaut's account varies in some particulars from that of La Harpe's. He calls the Mahkahto Green River instead of Blue and writes: \" We took our route by its mouth and ascended it forty leagues, wlien we found another river falling in to the Saint Pierre, which we entered. We sailed this the Green River because it is of that color by reason of a green earth which loosening itself from from the copper mines, becomes dis solved and makes it green. '\u25a0This mine is situated at the beginning of a very long mountain, which is upon the bank of the river, so that boats can go right to the -mouth of the mine itself. At this place is the green earth, which is a foot and a half in thickness, and above it is a layer of earth as firm and hard as stone, and black and burnt like coal by the exhalation from the mine. The copper is scratched out with a knife. There are no trees upon this mountain. * * * After twenty-two days' work, we returned to our fort. When the Sioux, who belong to the nation of savages who pillaged the Canadians, came they brought us merchandize of furs. \" A league up this river, we found a point of land a quarter of a league distant from the woods, and it was upon this point that M. Le Sueur resolved to build his fort, because we could not go any higher on account of the ice, it being the last day of September. Half of our people went hunting whilst the others worked on the fort. WTe killed four hundred buffaloes, which were our provisions for the winter, and which we placed upon scaffolds in our fort, after having skinned and cleaned and quartered them. We also made cabins in the fort, and a magazine to keep our goods. After having drawn up our shallop within the inclosure of the fort, we spent the winter in our cabins. \"They had more than four himdred beaver robes, each robe made of nine skins sewed to gether. M. Le Sueur purchased these and many other skins wilich he bargained for, in the week he traded with the savages. * We sell in return wares which come very dear to the buyers, especially tobacco from Brazil, in the proportion of a hundred crowns the pound; two little horn-handled knives, and four leaden bul lets are equal to ten crowns in exchange for skins ; and so with the rest. \" When wre were working in our fort in the beginning seven French traders from Canada took refuge there. They had been pillaged and stripped naked by the Sioux, a wandering nation hving only by hunting and plundering. Among these seven persons there was a Canadian gen tleman of Le Sueur's acquaintance, whom he rec ognized at once, and gave him some clothes, as he did also to all the rest, and whatever else was necessary for them. They remained with us during the entire winter at our fort, where we had not food enough for all, except buffalo meat \" In the beginning of May, we launched our shallop in the water, and loaded it with green"], [62, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 48 to him an unfortunate investment, as he has been robbed of a part of the goods by the Outa gamies. The occasion of the robbery by one of our own allies was as follows. I speak with a full knowledge of the facts as they occurred while I was at Michilliniackiane. From time immemo rial our allies have been at war with the Sioux, and on my arrival there in conformity to the or der of M. Frontenac, the most able man who has ever come into Canada, I attempted to negotiate a truce between the Sioux and all our allies. Succeeding in this negotiation I took the occa sion to turn their arms against the Iroquois with whom we were then at war, and soon after I ef fected a treaty of peace between the Sioux and the French and their allies which lasted two years. earth that had been taken out of the river, and with the furs we had traded for, of which we had three canoes full. M. Le Sueur before going held council with M. D'Evaque [or Eraque] the Canadian gentleman, and the three great chiefs of the Sioux, three brothers, and told them that as he had to return to the sea, he desired them to live in peace with M. D'Evaque, whom he left hi command at Fort L'Huillier, with twelve Frenchmen. M. Le Sueur made a considerable present to the three brothers, chiefs of the sava ges, desiring them to never abandon the French. Afterward we the twelve men whom he had chosen to go down to the sea with him embarked. In set ting out, M. Le Sueur promised to M. D'Evaque and the twelve Frenchmen who remained with him to guard the fort, to send up munitions of war from the Illinois country as soon as he should arrive there ; which he did, for on getting there he sent off to him a canoe loaded with two thou sand pounds of lead and powder, with three of our people in charge.\" \"At the end of tha'; time the Sioux came, in great numbers, to the villages of the Miamis, un der pretense of ratifying the treaty. They were well received by the Miamis, and, after spending several days in their villages, departed, apparent ly perfectly satisfied with their good reception, as they certainly had every reason to be. Le Sueur arrived at the French fort on the Gulf of Mexico in safety, and in a few weeks, in the spring of 1701, sailed for France, with his kinsman, D'lberville, the first governor of Lou isiana. \" The Miamis, believing them already far dis tant, slept quietly; but the Sioux, who had pre meditated the attack, returned the same night to the principal village of the Miamis, where most of the tribe were congregated, and, taking them by surprise, slaughtered nearly three thousand(?) and put the rest to flight.. In the spring of the next year (1702) D'Evaque came to Mobile and reported to D'lberville, who had come back from France, that he had been attacked by the Foxes and Maskoutens, who killed three Frenchmen who were working near Fort LTIuillier, and that, being out of powder and lead, he had been obliged to conceal the goods which were left and abandon the post. At the Wisconsin River he had met Juchereau, formerly criminal judge in Montreal, with thirty-five men, on his way to establish a tannery for buffalo skins at the Wabash, and that at the Illinois he met the canoe of supplies sent by Bienville, DTberville's brother. \" This perfectly infuriated all tne nations. They came with their complaints, begging me to join with them and exterminate the Sioux. But the war we then had on our hands did not permit it, so it became necessary to play the orator in a long harangue. In conclusion I advised them to ' weep their dead, and wrap them up, and leave them to sleep coldly till the day of vengeance should come;' telling them we must sweep the land on this side of the Iroquois, as it was neces sary to extinguish even their memory, after which the allied tribes could more easily avenge the atrocious deed that the Sioux had just committed upon them. In short, I managed them so well that the affair was settled in the manner that I proposed. La Motte Cadillac, in command at Detroit, in a letter written on August 31st, 1703, alludes to Le Sueur's expedition in these words: \"Last year they sent Mr. Boudor, a Montreal merchant, into the country of the Sioux to join Le Su eur. He succeeded so well in that journey he transported thither twenty-five or thirty thous and pounds of merchandize with which to trade in all the country of the Outawas. This proved \" But the twenty-five permits still existed, and the cupidity of the French induced them to go among the Sioux to trade for beaver.

Boudor has just been robbed by the Fox nation, and M. Jucheraux has given a thousand crowns, in goods, for the right of passage through the country of the allies to his habitation. \" I immediately informed M. Frontenac, and M. Champigny having read the communication, and commanded that an ordinance be published at Mon treal forbidding the traders to go into the country of the Sioux for the purpose of traffic under penalty of a thousand francs fine, the confiscation of the goods, and other arbitrary penalties. The ordi nance was sent to me and faithfully executed. The same year [1699] I descended to Quebec, having asked to be reheved. Since that time, in spite of this prohibition, the French have con tinued to trade with the Sioux, but not without being subject to affronts and indignities from our allies themselves which bring dishonor on the French name. * * * I do not consider it best any longer to allow the traders to carry on com merce with the Sioux, under any pretext what- \" The allies say that Le Sueur has gone to the Sioux on the Mississippi; that they are resolved to oppose him, and if he offers any resistance they will not be answerable for the consequences. It would be well, therefore, to give Le Sueur warning by the Governor of Mississippi. \"The Sauteurs [Chippeways] being friendly with the Sioux wished to give passage through their country to M. Boudor and others, permit ting them to carry arms and other munitions of war to this nation; but the other nations being opposed to it, differences have arisen between them which have resulted in the robbery of M. Boudor. This has given occasion to the Sau teurs to make an outbreak upon the Sacs and Foxes, killing thirty or forty of them.

I do not know what course the Pottawatomies will take, nor even what course they will pursue who are here, if M. Louvigny does not come, es pecially if the Foxes were to attack them or us.\" The next July, M. Lignery urged upon the au thorities the establishment of a garrison of trained soldiers at Mackinaw, and the Intendant of Can ada wrote to the King of France : \" Michilimackinac might be re - estabhshed, without expense to his Majesty, either by sur rendering the trade of the post to such individu als as will obligate themselves to pay all the ex penses of twenty-two soldiers and two officers; to furnish munitions of war for the defense of the fort, and to make presents to the savages. After the Fox Indians drove away Le Sueur's men, in 1702, from the Makahto, or Blue Earth river, the merchants of Montreal and Quebec did not encourage trade with the tribes beyond Mack inaw. DAigreult, a French officer, sent to inspect that post, in the summer of 1708, reported that he arrived there, on the 19th of August, and found there but fourteen or fifteen Frenchmen. He also wrote: \" Since there are now only a few wanderers at Michilimackinack, the greater part of the furs of the savages of the north goes to the English trading posts on Hudson's Bay. The Outawas are unable to make this trade by them selves, because the northern savages are timid, and will not come near them, as they have often been plundered. It is, therefore, necessary that the French be allowed to seek these northern tribes at the mouth of their own river, which empties into Lake Superior.\" \" Or the expenses of the post might be paid by the sale of permits, if the King should not think proper to grant an exclusive commerce. It is ab solutely necessary to know the wishes of the King concerning these two propositions ; and as M. Lignery is at Michilimackinac, it will not be any greater injury to the colony to defer the re-estab ment of this post, than it has been for eight or ten years past.\" The war with England ensued, and in April, 1713, the treaty of Utrecht was ratified. France had now more leisure to attend to the Indian tribes of the West. Louis de la Porte, the Sieur De Louvigny, in 1690, accompanied by Nicholas Perrot, with a de tachment of one hundred and seventy Canadians and Indians, came to Mackinaw, and until 1694 was in command, when he was recalled. Early in 1714, Mackinaw was re-occupied, and on the fourteenth of March, 1716, an expedition under Lieutenant Louvigny, left Quebec. His arrival at Mackinaw, where he had been long ex pected, gave confidence to the voyageurs, and friendly Indians, and with a force of eight hun dred men, he proceeded against the Foxes in Wisconsin. He brought with him two pieces of cannon and a grenade mortar, and besieged the fort of the Foxes, which he stated contained five hundred warriors, and three thousand men, a declaration which can scarcely be credited. After -In 1712, Father Joseph J. Marest the Jesuit missionary wrote, \" If this country ever needs M. Louvigny it is now ; the savages say it is ab solutely necessary that he should come for the safety of the country, to unite the tribes and to defend those whom the war has caused to return to Michilimacinac. ******"], [65, "DESIRE FOR A NORTHERN ROUTE 10 THE PACIFIC. 51 three days of skirmishing he prepared to mine the fort, when the Foxes capitulated. had killed the French, but he thought the sta tionary Sioux would receive Christian instruction. The paddles of the birch bark canoes and the gay songs of the voyageurs now began to be heard once more on the waters of Lake Superior and its tributaries. In 1717, the post erected by Du Luth, on Lake Superior near the northern boun dary of Minnesota, was re-occupied by Lt. Ro bertel de la Noue. The hostility of the Foxes had also prevented the establishment of a fort and mission among the Sioux. On the seventh of June, 1726, peace was con cluded by De Lignery with the Sauks, Foxes, and Winnebagoes at Green Bay; and Linctot, who had succeeded Saint Pierre in command at La Pointe, was ordered, by presents and the promise of a missionary, to endeavor to detach the Dah kotahs from their alliance with the Foxes. At this time Linctot made arrangements for peace between the Ojibways and Dahkotas, and sent two Frenchmen to dwell in the villages of the latter, with a promise that, if they ceased to fight the Ojibways, they should have regular trade, and a \"black robe\" reside in their country. In view of the troubles among the tribes of the northwest, in the month of September, 1718, Cap tain St. Pierre, who had great influence with the Indians of Wisconsin and Minnesota, was sent with Ensign Linctot and some soldiers to re-oc cupy La Pointe on Lake Superior, now Bayfield, in the northwestern part of Wisconsin. The chiefs of the band there, and at Keweenaw, had threatened war against the Foxes, who had killed some of their number. Traders and missionaries now began to prepare for visiting the Sioux, and in the spring of 1727 the Governor of Canada wrote that the fathers, appointed for the Sioux mission, desired a case of mathematical instruments, a universal astro nomic dial, a spirit level, chain and stakes, and a telescope of six or seven feet tube. When the Jesuit Charlevoix returned to France after an examination of the resources of Canada and Louisiana, he urged that an attempt should be made to reach the Pacific Ocean by an inland route, and suggested that an expedition should proceed from the mouth of the Missouri and fol low that stream, or that a post should be estab lished among the Sioux which should be the point of departure. The latter was accepted, and in 1722 an allowance was made by the French Gov ernment, of twelve hundred livres, for two Jes uit missionaries to accompany those who should establish the new post. D'Avagour, Superin tendent of Missions, in May, 1723, requested the authorities to grant a separate canoe for the con veyance of the goods of the proposed mission, and as it was necessary to send a commandant to persuade the Indians to receive the mission aries, he recommended Sieur Pachot, an officer of experience. On the sixteenth of June, 1727, the expedition for the Sioux country left Montreal in charge of the Sieur de la Perriere who was son of the dis tinguished and respected Canadian, Pierre Bou cher, the Governor of Three Rivers. La Perriere had served in Newfoundland and been associated with Hertel de Rouville in raids into New England, and gained an unenviable no toriety as the leader of the savages, while Rou ville led the French in attacks upon towns like Haverhill, Massachusetts, where the Indians ex ultingly killed the Puritan pastor, scalped his loving wife, and dashed out his infant's brains against a rock. He was accompanied by his brother and other relatives. Two Jesuit fathers, De Gonor and Pierre Michel Guignas, were also of the party. A dispatch from Canada to the French govern ment, dated October 14, 1723, announced that Father de la Chasse, Superior of the Jesuits, ex pected that, the next spring, Father Guymoneau, and another missionary from Paris, would go to the Sioux, but that they had been hindered by the Sioux a few months before kilting seven French men, on their way to Louisiana. The aged Jesuit, Joseph J. Marest, who had been on Lake Pepin in 1689 with Perrot, and was now in Mon treal, said that it was the wandering Sioux who In Shea's \" Early French Voyages\" there was printed, for the first time, a letter from Father Guignas, from the Brevoort manuscripts, written on May 29, 1728, at Fort Beauharnois, on Lake Pepin, which contains facts of much interest. He writes: \" The Scioux convoy left the end of Montreal Island on the 16th of the month of June last year, at 11 a.m., and reached Michili-"], [66, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 52 mackinac the 22d of the month of July.

Yet it is apparently quite wide, with a chain of hills on both sides, but there is only one miserable little channel amid this extent of apparent bed, which is a kind of marsh full of rushes and wild rice of almost impenetrable thickness. They have nothing but mere bark cabins, without any kind of palisade or other fortification. As soon as the French ca noes touched their shore they ran down with their peace calumets, lighted in spite of the rain, and all smoked. \" We spent the rest of the month at this post, in the hope of receiving from day to day some news from Montreal, and in the design of strengthening ourselves against the alleged ex treme difficulties of getting a free passage through the Foxes. At last, seeing nothing, we set out on our march, the first of the month of August, and. after seventy-three leagues quite pleasant sail along the northerly side of Lake Michigan, running to the southeast, we reached the Bay [Green] on the 8th of the same month, at 5:30 p. M. This post is at 44 degrees 43 minutes north latitude. \"We stayed among them the rest of this day, and all the next, to know what wrere their designs and ideas as to the French post among the Sioux. The Sieur Reaume, interpreter of Indian lan guages at the Bay, acted efficiently there, and with devotion to the King's service. Even if my testimony, Sir, should be deemed not impartial, I must have the honor to tell you that Rev. Father Chardon, an old missionary, was of very great as sistance there, and the presence of three mission aries reassured these cut-throats and assassins of the French more than all the speeches of the best orators could have done. \" We stopped there two days, and on the 11th in the morning, we embarked, in a very great impatience to reach the Foxes. On the third day after our departure from the bay, quite late in the afternoon, in fact somewhat in the night, the chiefs of the Puans [Winnebagoes] came out three leagues from their village to meet the French, with their peace calumets and some bear meat as a refreshment, and the next day we were received by that small nation, amid several discharges of a few guns, and with great demonstrations. \" A general council was convened in one of the cabins, they were addressed in decided friendly terms, and they rephed in the same way. A small present was made to them. On their side they gave some quite handsome dishes, lined with dry meat. \" They asked us with so good a grace to do them the honor to stay some time with them that we granted them the rest of the day from noon, and the following day. There may be in all the village, sixty to eighty men, but all the men and women of very tall stature, and well made. They are on the bank of a very pretty httle lake, in a most agreeable spot for its situation and the goodness of the soil, nineteen leagues from the bay and eight leagues from the Foxes. On the following Sunday, 17th of the month of August, very early in the morning, Father Chardon set out, with Sieur Reaume, to return to the Bay, and the Sioux expedition, greatly re joiced to have so easily got over this difficulty, which had everywhere been represented as so in surmountable, got under way to endeavor to reach its journey's end. \" Early the next morning, the 15th of the month of August, the convoy preferred to continue its route, with quite pleasant weather, but a storm coming on in the afternoon, we arrived quite wet, still in the rain, at the cabins of the Foxes, a nation so much dreaded, and really so httle to be dreaded. From all that we could see, it is composed of two hundred men at most, but there is a perfect hive of children, especially boys from ten to fourteen years old, well formed. \" Never was navigation more tedious than what we subsequently made from uncertainty as to our course. No one knew it, and we got astray every moment on water and on land for want of a guide and pilots. We kept on, as it were feeling our way for eight days, for it was only on the ninth, about three o'clock p. m., that we arrived, by accident, believing ourselves still far off, at the portage of the Ouisconsin, which is forty-five leagues from the Foxes, counting all the twists and turns of this abominable river. ' \u2022 They are cabined on a little eminence on the bank of a small river that bears their name, ex-"], [67, "SITUATION AND DESCRIPTION OF FORT BEAUHARNOIS. 53 This portage is half a league in length, and half of that is a kind of marsh full of mud, of one hundred feet, surrounded by pickets twelve feet long, with two good bastions. For so small a space there are large buildings quite distinct and not huddled together, each thirty, thirty-eight and twenty-five feet long by sixteen feet wide. \" The Ouisconsin is quite a handsome river, but far below what we had been told, apparently, as those who gave the description of it in Canada saw it only in the high waters of spring. It is a shallow river on a bed of quicksand, which forms bars almost everywhere, and these often change place. Its shores are either steep, bare mountains or low points with sandy base. Its course is from northeast to southwest. From the portage to its mouth in the Mississippi, I estimated thirty-eight leagues. The portage is at 43 deg. 24 min. north latitude. \" All would go well there if the spot were not inundated, but this year [1728], on the 15th of the month of April, we were obliged to camp out and the water ascended to the height of two feet and eight inches in the houses, and it is idle to say that it was the quantity of snow that fell this year. The snow in the vicinity had melted long before, and there was only a foot and a half from the 8th of February to the 15th of March; you could not use snow-shoes. \" The Mississippi from the mouth of the Ouis consin ascending, goes northwest. This beauti ful river extends between two chains of high, bare and very sterile mountains, constantly a league, three-quarters of a league, or where it is narrowest, half a league f.part. Its centre is oc cupied by a chain of well wooded islands, so that regarding from the heights above, you would think you saw an endless valley watered on the right and left by two large rivers ; sometimes, too, you could discern no river. These islands are overflowed every year, and would be adapted to raising rice. Fifty-eight leagues from the mouth of the Ouisconsin, according to my calculation, ascending the Mississippi, is Lake Pepin, which is nothing else but the river itself, destitute of islands at that point, where it may be half a league wide. This river, in what I traversed of it, is shallow, and has shoals in several places, be cause its bed is moving sands, like that of the Ouisconsin. \" I have great reason to think that this spot is inundated more or less every year; I have always thonght so, but they were not obliged to believe me, as old people who said that they had lived in this region fifteen or twenty years declared that it was never overflowed. We could not enter our much-devastated houses until the 30th of April, and the disorder is even now scarcely re paired. \" Before the end of October [1727] all the houses were finished and furnished, and each one found himself tranquilly lodged at home. They then thought only of going out to explore the hills and rivers and to see those herds of all kinds of deer of which they tell such stories in Canada. They must have retired, or diminished greatly, since the time the old voyageurs left the country; they are no longer in such great numbers, and are killed with difficulty. \"On the 17th of September, 1727, at noon, we reached this lake, which had been chosen as the bourne of our voyage. We planted ourselves on the shore about the middle of the north side, on a low point, where the soil is excellent. The wood is very dense there, but is already thinned in consequence of the rigor and length of the winter, which has been severe for the climate, for we are here on the parallel of 43 deg. 41 min. It is true that the difference of the winter is great compared to that of Quebec and Montreal, for all that some poor judges say. \" After beating the field, for some time, all re assembled at the fort, and thought of enjoying a httle the fruit of their labors.

This article, which re gards the service, and the expense of which must be on his majesty's account, obliges them to ap ply for orders. They will, as far as lies in their power, induce the traders to meet that expense, which will possibly amount to 1000 livres or 1500 livres a year for the commandant, and in proportion for the officer under him; but, as in the beginning of an establishment the expenses exceed the profits, it is improbable that any com pany of merchants will assume the outlay, and in this case they demand orders on this point, as well as his majesty's opinion as to the necessity of preserving so useful a post, and a nation which has already afforded proofs of its fidelity and atr tachment. which invitation they accepted, and returned only in the month of July following. \" The interests of religion, of the service, and of the colony, are involved in the maintenance of this establishment, which has been the more nec essary as there is no doubt but the Foxes, when routed, would have found an asylum among the Scioux had not the French been settled there, and the docility and submission manifested by the Foxes can not be attributed to any cause ex cept the attention entertained by the Scioux for the French, and the offers which the former made the latter, of which the Foxes were fully cognisant. \" It is necessary to retain the Scioux in these favorable dispositions, in order to keep the Foxes in check and counteract the measures they might adopt to gain over the Scioux, who will invaria bly reject their propositions so long as the French remain in the country, and their trading post shall continue there. But, despite all these ad vantages and the importance of preserving that establishment, M. de Beauharnois cannot take any steps until he has news of the French who asked his permission this summer. to go up there with a canoe load of goods, and until assured that those who wintered there have not dismantled the fort, and that the Scioux continue in the same sentiments. Besides, it does not seem very easy, in the present conjuncture, to maintain that post unless there is a solid peace with the Foxes; on the other hand, the greatest portion of the tra ders, who apphed in 1727 for the establishment of that post, have withdrawn, and will not send thither any more, as the rupture with the Foxes, through whose country it is necessary to pass in order to reach the Scioux in canoe, has led them to abandon the idea. But the one and the other case might be remedied. The Foxes will, in all probability, come or send next year to sue for peace; therefore, if it be granted to them on ad vantageous conditions, there need be no appre hension when going to the Sioux, and another company could be formed, less numerous than the first, through whom, or some responsible mer chants able to afford the outfit, a new treaty could be made, whereby these difficulties would be soon obviated.

After peace was estabhshed with the Foxes, Legardeur Saint Pierre was in command at Fort Beauhar nois, and Father Guignas again attempted to es tablish a Sioux mission. In a communication dated 12th of October, 1736, by the Canadian au thorities is the following: \"In regard to the Scioux, Saint Pierre, who commanded at that post, and Father Guignas, the missionary, have written to Sieur de Beauharnois on the tenth and eleventh of last April, that these Indians ap peared well intentioned toward the French, and had no other fear than that of being abandoned by them. Sieur de Beauharnois annexes an ex tract of these letters, and although the Scioux seem very friendly, the result only can tell whether this fidelity is to be absolutely depended upon, for the unrestrained and inconsistent spirit which composes the Indian character may easily change it. They have not come over this summer as yet, but M. de la St. Pierre is to get them to do so next year, and to have an eye on their proceed ings.\" The reply to this communication from Louis"], [71, "DE LUSIGNAN VISITS THE SIOUX COUNTRY. \u25a0 a XV. dated Versailles, May 10th, 1737, was in these words : \" As respects the Scioux, according to what the commandant and missionary at that post have written to Sieur de Beauharnois rela tive to the disposition of these Indians, nothing appears to be wanting on that point. advised beforehand of the design of the French to wage war against them, it would be easy for them to retire to the one or the other before their passage could be intersected or themselves at tacked in their villages.\" In the summer of 1743, a deputation of the Sioux came down to Quebec, to ask that trade might be resumed. Three years after this, four Sioux chiefs came to Quebec, and asked that a commandant might be sent to Fort Beauharnois ; which was not granted. \" But their delay in coming down to Montreal since the time they have promised to do so, must render their sentiments somewhat suspected, and nothing but facts can determine whether their fidelity can be absolutely relied on. But what must still further increase the uneasiness to be entertained in their regard is the attack on the convoy of M. de Verandrie, especially if this officer has adopted the course he had informed the Marquis de Beauharnois he should take to have revenge therefor.\" During the winter of 1745-6, De Lusignan vis ited the Sioux country, ordered by the govern ment to hunt up the \"coureurs des bois,\" and withdraw them from the country. They started to return with him, but learning that they would be arrested at Mackinaw, for violation of law, they ran away. While at the villages of the Sioux of the lakes and plains, the chiefs brought to this officer nineteen of their young men, bound with cords, who had killed three Frenchmen, at the Illinois. While he remained with them, they made peace with the Ojibways of La Pointe, with whom they had been at war for some time. On his return, four chiefs accompanied him to Montreal, to solicit pardon for their young braves. The particulars of the attack alluded to will be found in the next chapter. Soon after this the Foxes again became troublesome, and the post on Lake Pepin was for a time abandoned by the French. A dispatch in 1 741 uses this language : \" The Marquis de Beauharnois' opinion respect ing the war against the Foxes, has been the more readily approved by the Baron de Longeuil, Messieurs De la Chassaigne, La Corne, de Lig nery, La Noue, and Duplessis - Fabert, whom he had assembled at his house, as it appears from all the letters that the Count has writ n for sev eral years, that he has nothing so much at heart as the destruction of that Indian nation, which can not be prevailed on by the presents and the good treatment of the French, to live in peace, not withstanding all its promises. The lessees of the trading-post lost many of their peltries that winter in consequence of a fire. Reminiscences of St. Pierre's residence at Lake Pepin were long preserved. Carver, in 1766, \"ob served the ruins of a French factory, where, it is said, Captain St. Pierre resided, and carried on a great trade with the Nadouessies before the re duction of Canada.\" \" Besides, it is notorious that the Foxes have a secret understanding with the Iroquois, to secure a retreat among the latter, in case they be obliged to abandon their villages. They have one already secured among the Sioux of the prairies, with whom they are alhed; so that, should they be Pike, in 1805, wrote in his journal: \" Just be low Pt.

De Gonor conversed much upon the route to the Pacific with Verendrye, and promised to use his influence with the Canadian authorities to advance the project of exploration. Charles De Beauharnois, the Governor of Can ada, gave Verendrye a respectful hearing, and carefully examined the map of the region west of the great lakes, which had been drawn by Ocha gachs (Otchaga), the Indian guide. Orders were soon given to fit out an expedition- of fifty men. It left Montreal in 1731, under the conduct of his sons and nephew De la Jemeraye, he not joining the party till 1733, in consequence of the deten tions of business. Early in the year 1728, two travelers met at the secluded post of Mackinaw, one was named De Gonor, a Jesuit Father, who with Guignas, had gone with the expedition, that the September before had built Fort Beauharnois on the shores of Lake Pepin, the other was Pierre Gualtier Va reinies, the Sieur de la Verendrye the commander of the post on Lake Nepigon of the north shore of Lake Superior, and a relative of the Sieur de la Perriere, the commander at Lake Pepin. In the autumn of 1731, the party reached Rainy Lake, by the Nantouagan, or Groselliers river, now called Pigeon. Father Messayer, who had been stationed on Lake Superior, at the Grosel liers river, was taken as a spiritual guide. At the foot of Rainy Lake a post was erected and called Fort St. Pierre, and the next year, having crossed Minittie, or Lake of the Woods, they es tablished Fort St. Charles on its southwestern bank. Five leagues from Lake Winnipeg they established a post on the Assinaboine. An un published map of these discoveries by De la Jem eraye still exists at Paris. The river Winnipeg, called by them Maurepas, in honor of the minis ter of France in 1734, was protected by a fort of the same name. Verendrye was the son of Rene Gualtier Va rennes who for twenty-two years was the chief magistrate at Three Rivers, whose wife was Ma rie Boucher, the daughter of his predecessor whom he had married when she was twelve years of age. He became a cadet in 1697, and in 1704 accompanied an expedition to New England. The next year he was in Newfoundland and the year following he went to France, joined a regi ment of Brittany and was in the conflict at Mal plaquet when the French troops were defeated by the Duke of Marlborough. When he returned to Canada he was obhged to accept the position of ensign notwithstanding the gallant manner in which he had behaved. In time he became iden tified with the Lake Superior region. While at Lake Nepigon the Indians assured him that there was a communication largely by water to the Pacific Ocean. One, named Ochagachs, drew a rude map of the country, which is still preserved among the French archives. Pigeon River is About this time their advance was stopped by the exhaustion of supplies, but on the 12th of April, 1735, an arrangement was made for a sec ond equipment, and a fourth son joined the expe dition. In June, 1736, while twenty-one of the expedi-"], [73, "DISCOVERY OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 59 tion were camped upon an isle in the Lake of the Woods, they were surprised by a band of Sioux hostile to the French allies, the Cristinaux, and all killed. The island, upon this account, is called Massacre Island. A few days after, a party of five Canadian voyageurs discovered their dead bodies and scalped heads. Father Ouneau, the missionary, was found upon one knee, an ar row in his head, his breast bare, his left hand touching the ground, and the right hand raised. a leaden plate of the arms of France, and raised a monument of stones, which they called Beau harnois. They returned to the Lake of the Woods on the 2d of July. North of the Assiniboine they proceeded to Lake Dauphin, Swan's Lake, explored the riv er \"Des Biches,\" and ascended even to the fork of the Saskatchewan, which they called Pos koiac. Two forts were subsequently established, one near Lake Dauphin and the other on the river \" des Biches,\" called Fort Bourbon. The northern route, by the Saskatchewan, was thought to have some advantage over the Missouri, be cause there was no danger of meeting with the Spaniards. Among the slaughtered was also a son of Ver endrye, who had a tomahawk in his back, and his body adorned with garters and bracelets of porcu pine. The father was at the foot of the Lake of the Woods when he received the news of his son's murder, and about the same time heard of the death of his enterprising nephew, Dufrost de la Jemeraye, the son of his sister Marie Reine de Varennes, and brother of Madame Youville, the foundress of the Hospitaliers at Montreal. Governor Beauharnois having been prejudiced against Verendrye by envious persons, De Noy elles was appointed to take command of the posts. During these difficulties, we find Sieur de la Verendrye, Jr., engaged in other duties. In August, 1747, he arrives from Mackinaw at Mon treal, and in the autumn of that year he accom panies St. Pierre to Mackinaw, and brings back the convoy to Montreal. In February, 1748, with five Canadians, five Cristenaux, two Ottawas, and one Sauteur, he attacked the Mohawks near Schenectady, and returned to Montreal with two scalps, one that of a chief. On June 20th, 1748, it is recorded that Chevalier de la Verendrye de parted from Montreal for the head of Lake Supe rior. Margry states that he perished at sea in November, 1764, by the wreck of the \" Auguste.\" It was under the guidance of the latter that the party had, in 1731, mastered the difficulties of the Nantaouagon, or Groselliers river. On the 3d of October, 1738, they built an ad vanced post, Fort La Reine, on the river Assini boels, now Assinaboine, which they called St Charles, and beyond was a branch called St. Pierre. These two rivers received the baptismal name of Verendrye, which was Pierre, and Gov ernor Beauharnois, which wras Charles. The post became the centre of trade and point of departure for explorations, either north or south. It was by ascending the Assinaboine, and by the present trail from its tributary, Mouse river, they reached the country of the Mantanes, and in 1741, came to the upper Missouri, passed the Yel low Stone, and at length arrived at the Rocky Mountains. The party was led by the eldest son and his brother, the chevalier. They left the Lake of the Woods on the 29th of April, 1742, came in sight of the Rocky Mountains on the 1st of January, 1743, and on the 12th ascended them. On the route they fell in with the Beaux Hom mes, Pioya, Petits Renards, and Arc tribes, and stopped among the Snake tribe, but could go no farther in a southerly direction, owing to a war between the Arcs and Snakes. Fortunately, Gahssioniere the successor of Beauharnois, although deformed and insignifi cant in appearance, was fair minded, a lover of science, especially botany, and anxious to push discoveries toward the Pacific. Verendrye the father was restored to favor, and made Captain of the Order of St. Loms, and ordered to resume explorations, but he died on December 6th, 1749, while planning a tour up the Saskatchewan. The Swedish Professor, Kalm, met him in Can ada, not long before his decease, and had inter esting conversations with him about the furrows on the plains of the Missouri, which he errone ously conjectured indicated the former abode of an agricultural people. These ruts are familiar to modern travelers, and may be only buffalo trails. On the 19th of May, 1744, they had returned to the upper Missouri, and, in the country of the Petite Cerise tribe, they planted on an eminence Father Coquard, wno had been associated with"], [74, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 60 he determined to send two expeditions toward the Pacific Ocean, one by the Missouri and the other by the Saskatchewan. Verendrye, says that they first met the Mantanes, and next the Brochets. After these were the Gros Ventres, the Crows, the Flat Heads, the Black Feet, and Dog Feet, who were established on the Missouri, even up to the falls, and that about thirty leagues beyond they found a narrow oass in the mountains. Father Coquard, one of the companions of Ve rendrye, was consulted as to the probability of finding a pass in the Rocky Mountains, through which they might, in canoes, reach the great lake of salt water, perhaps Puget's Sound. Bougainville gives a more full account: he says: 'He who most advanced this discovery was the Sieur de la Veranderie. He went from Fort la Reine to the Missouri. He met on the banks of this river the Mandans, or White Beards, who had seven villages with pine stockades, strength ened by a ditch. Next to these were the Kinon gewiniris. or the Brochets, in three villages, and toward the upper part of the river were three villages of the Mahantas. All along the mouth of the Wabeik, or Shell River, were situated twenty-three villages of the Panis. To the south west of this river, on the banks of the Ouanarade ba, or La Graisse, are the Hectanes or Snake tribe. They extend to the base of a chain of mountains which runs north northeast. South of this is the river Karoskiou, or Cerise Pelee, which is supposed to flow to California. The enterprise was at length confided to two experienced officers, Lamarque de Marin and Jacques Legardeur de Saint Pierre. The former was assigned the way, by the Missouri, and to the latter was given the more northern route; but Saint Pierre in some way excited the hostil ity of the Cristinaux, who attempted to kill him, and burned Fort la Reine. His lieutenant, Bou cher de Niverville, who had been sent to establish a post toward the source of the Saskatchewan, failed on account of sickness. Some of his men, however, pushed on to the Rocky Mountains, and in 1753 established Fort Jonquiere. Henry says St. Pierre established Fort Bourbon. In 1753, Saint Pierre was succeeded in the command of the posts of the West, by de la Corne, and sent to French Creek, in Pennsylva nia. He had been but a few days there when he received a visit from Washington, just entering upon manhood, bearing a letter from Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia, complaining of the en croachments of the French. \" He found in the immense region watered by the Missouri, and in the vicinity of forty leagues, the Mahantas, the Owiliniock, or Beaux Hom mes, four villages; opposite the Brochets the Black Feet, three villages of a hundred lodges each; op posite the Mandans are the Ospekakaerenousques, or Flat Heads, four villages; opposite tha Panis are the Arcs of Cristinaux, and Utasibaoutchatas of Assmiboel, three villages; following these the Makesch, or Little Foxes, two villages; tho Pi wassa, or great talkers, three villages; the Ka kokoschena, or Gens de la Pie, five villages; the Kiskipisounouini,, or the Garter tribe, seven vil lages.\" Soon the clash of arms between France and England began, and Saint Pierre, at the head of the Indian allies, fell near Lake George, in Sep tember, 1755, in a battle with the English. After the seven years' war was concluded, by the treaty of Paris, the French relinquished all their posts in the Northwest, and the work begun by Veren drye, was, in 1805, completed by Lewis and Clarke ; and the Northern Pacific Railway is fast approaching the passes of the Rocky Mountains, through the valley of the Yellow Stone, and from thence to the great land-locked bay of the ocean, Puget's Sound. Galassoniere was succeeded by Jonquiere in the governorship of Canada, who proved to be a grasping, peevish, and very miserly person.

English influence produced increasing dissatis faction among the Indians that were beyond Mackinaw. Not only were the voyageurs robbed and maltreated at Sault St. Marie and other points on Lake Superior, but even the commandant at Mackinaw was exposed to insolence, and there was no security anywhere. Under the influence of Sieur Marin, who was in command at Green Bay in 1753, peaceful re lations were in a measure restored between the French and Indians. As the war between England and France deep ened, the officers of the distant French posts were called in and stationed nearer the enemy. Legardeur St. Pierre, was brought from the Lake Winnipeg region, and, in December, 1753, was in command of a rude post near Erie, Pennsylvania. Langlade, of Green Bay, Wisconsin, arrived early in July, 1755, at Fort Duquesne. With Beauyeu and De Lignery, who had been engaged in fight ing the Fox Indians, he left that fort, at nine o'clock of the morning of the 9th of July, and, a httle after noon, came near the English, who had halted on the south shore of the Monongahela, and were at dinner, with their arms stacked. By the urgent entreaty of Langlade, the western half-breed, Beauyeu, the officer in command or dered an attack, and Braddock was overwhelmed, and Washington was obliged to say, \" We have been beaten, shamefully beaten, by a handful of Frenchmen.\" On the twenty-third of August, 1747, Philip Le Due arrived at Mackinaw from Lake Superior, stating that he had been robbed of his goods at Kamanistigoya, and that the Ojibways of the lake were favorably disposed toward the English. The Dahkotahs were also becoming unruly in the absence of French officers. In a few weeks after Le Due's robbery, St. Pierre left Montreal to become commandant at Mackinaw, and Vercheres was appointed for the post at Green Bay. In the language of a docu ment of the day, St. Pierre was \" a very good officer, much esteemed among all the nations of those parts ; none more loved and feared.\" On his arrival, the savages were so cross, that he ad vised that no Frenchman should come to trade. By promptness and boldness, he secured the Indians who had murdered some Frenchmen, and obtained the respect of the tribes. While the three murderers were being conveyed in a canoe down the St. Lawrence to Quebec, in charge of a sergeant and seven soldiers, the savages, with characteristic cunning, though manacled, suc ceeded in killing or drowning the guard. Cutting their irons with an axe, they sought the woods, and escaped to their own country. \"Thus,\" writes Galassoniere, in 1748, to Count Maurepas, Under Baron Dieskau, St. Pierre commanded the Indians, in September, 1755, during the cam paign near Lake George, where he fell gallantly fighting the Enghsh, as did his commander. The Rev. Claude Coquard, alluding to the French defeat, in a letter to his brother, remarks: \" We lost, on that occasion, a brave officer, M. de St. Pierre, and had his advice, as well as that of several other Canadian officers, been followed, Jonckson [Johnson] was irretrievably destroyed,"], [76, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 62 and we should have been spared the trouble we have had this year.\" Pierre, Lusignan, Marin, Langlade, and others, became the pioneers of the British, a few years afterwards, in the occupation of the outposts of the lakes, and in the exploration of Minnesota. Other officers who had been stationed on the borders of Minnesota also distinguished them selves during the French war. The Marquis Montcalm, in camp at Ticonderoga, on the twen ty-seventh of July, 1757, writes to Vaudreuil, Governor of Canada: Rogers, the celebrated captain of rangers, sub sequently commander of Mackinaw, and Jona than Carver, the first British explorer of Minne sota, were both on duty near Lake Champlain, the latter narrowly escaping at the battle of Fort George. \" Lieutenant Marin, of the Colonial troops, who has exhibited a rare audacity, did not consider himself bound to halt, although his detachment of about four hundred men was reduced to about two hundred, the balance having been sent back on account of inability to follow. He carried off a patrol of ten men, and swept away an ordinary guard of fifty hke a wafer; went up to the en emy's camp, under Fort Lydias (Edward), where he was exposed to a severe fire, and retreated like a warrior. He was unwilling to amuse himself making prisoners; he brought in only one, and thirty-two scalps, and must have killed many men of the enemy, in the midst of whose ranks it was neither wise nor prudent to go in search of scalps. The Indians generally all behaved well. * * * The Outaouais, who arrived with me, and whom I designed to go on a scouting party towards the lake, had conceived a project of administering a corrective to the Enghsh barges. * * * On the day before yesterday, your brother formed a detachment to accompany them. I arrived at his camp on the evening of the same day. Lieuten ant de Corbiere, of the Colonial troops, was re turning, in consequence of a misunderstanding, and as I knew the zeal and intelligence of that officer, I made him set out with a new instruc tion to join Messrs de Langlade and Hertel de Chantly. They remained in ambush all day and night yesterday; at break of day the English ap peared on Lake St. Sacrament, to the number of twenty-two barges, under the command of Sieur Parker. The whoops of our Indians impressed them with such terror that they made but feeble resistance, and only two barges escaped.\" On Christmas eve, 1757, Rogers approached Fort Ticonderoga, to fire the outhouses, but was prevented by discharge of the cannons of the French. He contented himself with killing fifteen beeves, on the horns of one of which he left this laconic and amusing note, addressed to the commander of the post: '\u2022 I am obhged to you, Sir, for the repose you have allowed me to take; / thank you for the fresh meat you have sent me, I request you to present my compliments to the Marquis du Montcalm.\" On the thirteenth of March, 1758, Durantaye, formerly at Mackinaw, had a skirmish with Rog ers. Both had been trained on the frontier, and they met \" as Greek met Greek.\" The conflict was fierce, and the French victorious. The In dian alhes, finding a scalp of a chief underneath an officer's jacket, were furious, and took one hundred and fourteen scalps in return. When the French returned, they supposed that Captain Rogers was among the killed. At Quebec, when Montcalm and Wolfe fell, there were Ojibways present assisting the French The Indians, returning from the expeditions against the Enghsh, were attacked with small pox, and many died at Mackinaw. On the eighth of September, 1760, the French delivered up all their posts in Canada. A few days after the capitulation at Montreal, Major Rogers was sent with English troops, to garrison the posts of the distant Northwest. On the eighth of September, 1761, a year after the surrender, Captain Balfour, of the eightieth regiment of the British army, left Detroit, with a detachment to take possession of the French forts at Mackinaw and Green Bay. Twenty-five soldiers were left at Mackinaw, in command of Lieutenant Leslie, and the rest sailed to Grsen Bay, under Lieutenant Gorrell of the Royal After De Corbiere's victory on Lake Cham plain, a large French army was collected at Ti conderoga, with which there were many Indians from the tribes of the Northwest, and the Ioways appeared for the first time in the east.

The fort had been abandoned for sev eral years, and was in a dilapidated condition. In charge of it there was left a lieutenant, a cor poral, and fifteen soldiers. Two Enghsh traders arrived at the same time, McKay from Albany, and Goddard from Montreal. then understood they lay out of the government of Canada, but made no doubt they would have traders from the Mississippi in the spring. They went away extremely well pleased. June 14th, 1763, the traders came down from the Sack coun try, and confirmed the news of Landsing and his son being killed by the French. There came with the traders some Puans, and four young men with one chief of the Avoy [loway] nation, to demand traders. ***** Gorrell in his journal alludes to the Minnesota Sioux. He writes \u2014 \" On March 1, 1763, twelve warriors of the Sous came here. It is certainly the greatest nation of Indians ever yet found. Not above two thousand of them were ever armed with firearms ; the rest depending entirely on bows and arrows, which they use with more skill than any other Indian nation in America. They can shoot the wildest and largest beasts in the woods at seventy or one hundred yards distant. They are remarkable for their dancing, and the other nations take the fashions from them. ***** This nation is always at war with the Chippewas, those who destroyed Mishamakinak. They told me with warmth that if ever the Chippewas or any other Indians wished to obstruct the passage of the traders coming up, to send them word, and they would come and cut them off from the face of the earth ; as all Indians were their slaves or dogs. I told them I was glad to see them, and hoped to have a lasting peace with them. They then gave me a letter wrote in French, and two belts of wampum from their king, in which he expressed great joy on hearing of there being English at his post. The letter was written by a French trader whom I had allowed to go among them last fall, with a promise of his behaving well ; which he did, better than any Canadian I ever knew. * * * -5 * With regard to traders, I would not allow any to go amongst them, as I \" On the nineteenth, a deputation of Winneba goes, Sacs, Foxes and Menominees arrived with a Frenchman named Pennensha.

He brought with him a pipe from the Sous, desiring that as the road is now clear, they would by no means allow the Chippewas to obstruct it, or give the English any disturbance, or prevent the traders from coming up to them.

In company with the traders, he left Green Bay on the twentieth, and ascending Fox river, arrived on the twenty-fifth at an island at the east end of Lake Winnebago, containing about fifty acres. Jonathan Carver was a native of Connecticut His grandfather, William Carver, was a native of WTigan, Lancashire, England, and a captain in King William's army during the campaign in Ireland, and for meritorious services received an appointment as an officer of the colony of Con necticut. Here he found a Winnebago village of fifty houses. He asserts that a woman was in author ity. In the month of October the party was at the portage of the Wisconsin, and descending that stream, they arrived, on the ninth at a town of the Sauks. While here he visited some lead mines about fifteen miles distant. An abundance of lead was also seen in the village, that had been brought from the mines. His father was a justice of the peace in the new world, and in 1732, the subject of this sketch was born. At the early age of fifteen he was called to mourn the death of his father. He then commenced the study of medicine, but his roving disposition could not bear the confines of a doc tor's office, and feeling, perhaps, that his genius would be cramped by pestle and mortar, at the age of eighteen he purchased an ensign's commis sion hi one of the regiments raised during the French war. He was of medium stature, and of strong mind and quick perceptions. On the tenth they arrived at the first village of the \" Ottigaumies\" [Foxes] about five miles be fore the Wisconsin joins the Mississippi, he per ceived the remnants of another village, and learned that it had been deserted about thirty years before, and that the inhabitants soon after their removal, built a town on the Mississippi, near the mouth of the \" Ouisconsin,\" at a place called by the French La Prairie les Chiens, which signified the Dog Plains. It was a large town, and contained about three hundred families. The houses were built after the Indian manner, and pleasantly situated on a dry rich soil. In the year 1757, he was captain under Colonel Williams in the battle near Lake George, where Saint Pierre was killed, and narrowly escaped with his life. After the peace of 1763, between France and England was declared, Carver conceived the pro ject of exploring the Northwest. Leaving Boston in the month of June, 1766, he arrived at Macki naw, then the most distant British post, in the month of August. Having obtained a credit on some French and English traders from Major Rogers, the officer in command, he started with them on the third day of September. Pursuing the usual route to Green Bay, they arrived there on the eighteenth. He saw here many houses of a good size and shape. This town was the great mart where all the adjacent tribes, and where those who inhabit the most remote branches of the Mississippi, an nually assemble about the latter end of May, bringing with them their furs to dispose of to the traders. But it is not always that they conclude their sale here. This was determined by a gen"], [79, "SUPPOSED FORTIFICATIONS NEAR LAKE PEPIN. 65 eral council of the chiefs, who consulted whether it would be more conducive to their interest to sell their goods at this place, or to carry them on to Louisiana or Mackinaw. of the bed of earth by which it was covered, I was able to draw certain conclusions of its great anti quity. I examined all the angles, and every part with great attention, and have often blamed my self since, for not encamping on the spot, and drawing an exact plan of it. To show that this description is not the offspring of a heated imag ination, or the chimerical tale of a mistaken trav eler, I find, on inquiry since my return, that Mons. St. Pierre, and several traders have at dif ferent times, taken notice of similar appearances, upon which they have formed the same conjec tures, but withont examining them so minutely as I did. How a work of this kind could exist in a country that has hitherto (according to the gen erally received opinion) been the seat of war to untutored Indians alone, whose whole stock of military knowledge has only, till within two cen turies, amounted to drawing the bow, and whose only breastwork even at present is the thicket, I know not. I have given as exact an account as possible of this singular appearance, and leave to future explorers of those distant regions, to dis cover whether it is a production of nature or art. Perhaps the hints I have here given might lead to a more perfect investigation of it, and give us very different ideas of the ancient state of realms that we at present believe to have been, from the earliest period, only the habitations of savages.\" At a small stream called Yellow River, oppo site Prairie du Chien, the traders who had thus far accompanied Carver took up their residence for the winter. From this point he proceeded in a canoe, with a Canadian voyageur and a Mohawk Indian as companions. Just before reaching Lake Pepin, while his attendants were one day preparing din ner, he walked out and was struck with the pecu liar appearance of the surface of the country, and thought it was the site of some vast artificial earth- work. It is a fact worthy of remembrance, that he was the first to call the attention of the civilized world to the existence of ancient monu ments in the Mississippi valley. We give his own description : \"On the first of November I reached Lake Pepin, a few miles below which I landed, and, whilst the servants were preparing my dinner, I ascended the bank to view the country. I had not proceeded far before I came to a fine, level, open plain, on which I perceived, at a little dis tance, a partial elevation that had the appearance of entrenchment. On a nearer inspection I had greater reason to suppose that it had really been intended for this many centuries ago. Notwith standing it was now covered with grass, I could plainly see that it-had once been a breastwork of about four feet in height, extending the best part of a mile, and sufficiently capacious to cover five thousand men. Its form was somewhat circular and its flanks reached to the river. Lake Pepin excited his admiration, as it has that of every traveler since his day, and here he remarks : \" I observed the ruins of a French fac tory, where it is said Captain St. Pierre resided, and carried on a very great trade with the Nau dowessies, before the reduction of Canada.\" Carver's first acquaintance with the Dahkotahs commenced near the river St. Croix. It would seem that the erection of trading posts on Lake Pepin had enticed them from their old residence on Rum river and Mille Lacs. \" Though much defaced by time, every angle was distinguishable, and appeared as regular and fashioned with as much military skill as if planned by Vauban himself. The ditch was not visible, but I thought, on examining more curiously, that I could perceive there certainly had been one. From its situation, also, I am convinced that it must have been designed for that purpose. It fronted the country, and the rear was covered by the river, nor was there any rising ground for a considerable way that commanded it; a few straggling lakes were alone to be seen near it. In many places small tracks were worn across it by the feet of the elks or deer, and from the depth He says: \"Near the river St. Croix reside bands of the Naudowessie Indians, called the River Bands. This nation is composed at pres ent of eleven bands. They were originally twelve, but the Assinipoils, some years ago, re volting and separating themselves from the oth ers, there remain at this time eleven. Those I met here are termed the River Bands, because they chiefly dwell near the banks of this river; the other eight are generally distinguished by the 5"], [80, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 66 curling waters. The chief, on reaching the emi nence some distance below Cheever's, began to invoke his gods, and offer oblations to the spirit in the waters. title of Nadowessies of the Plains, and inhabit a country more to the westward. The names of the former are Nehogatawonahs, the Mawtaw bauntowahs, and Shashweentowahs. \"In the middle of the Falls stands a small island, about forty feet broad and somewhat lon ger, on which grow a few cragged hemlock and spruce trees, and about half way between this island and the eastern shore is a rock, lying at the very edge of the Falls, in an oblique position, that appeared to be about five or six feet broad, and thirty or forty long. At a little distance be low the Falls stands a small island of about an acre and a half, on which grow a great number of oak trees.\" Arriving at wiiat is now a suburb of the cap ital of Minnesota, he continues: \"About thir teen miles below the Falls of St. Anthony, at which I arrived the tenth day after I left Lake Pepin, is a remarkable cave, of an amazing depth. The Indians term it Wakon-teebe [Wakan-tipi]. The entrance into it is about ten feet wide, the height of it five feet. The arch within is fifteen feet high and about thirty feet broad; the bottom consists of fine, clear sand. About thirty feet from the entrance begins a lake, the water of which is transparent, and extends to an unsearch able distance, for the darkness of the cave pre ents all attempts to acquire a knowledge of it.] I threw a small pebble towards the nterior part of it with my utmost strength. I could hear that it fell into the water, and, notwithstanding it was of a small size, it caused an astonishing and ter rible noise, that reverberated through all those gloomy regions. I found in this cave many In dian hieroglyphics, which appeared very ancient, for time had nearly covered them with moss, so that it was with difficulty I could trace them. They were cut in a rude manner upon the inside of the wall, which was composed of a stone so ex tremely soft that it might be easily penetrated with a knife; a stone everywhere to be found near the Mississippi. From this description, it would appear that the httle island, now some distance below the Falls, was once in the very midst, and shows that a con stant recession has been going on, and that in ages long past they were not far from the Minne sota river. No description is more glowing than Carver's of the country adjacent: \" The country around them is extremely beau tiful. It is not an uninterrupted plain, where the eye finds no relief, but composed of many gentle ascents, which in the summer are covered with the finest verdure, and interspersed with httle groves that give a pleasing variety to the pros pect. On the whole, when the Falls are inclu ded, which may be seen at a distance of four miles, a more pleasing and picturesque view, I believe, cannot be found throughout the uni verse.\" \" At a little distance from this dreary cavern, is the burying-place of several bands of the Nau dowessie Indians. Though these people have no fixed residence, being in tents, and seldom but a few months in one spot, yet they always bring the bones of the dead to this place. \" He arrived at the Falls on the seventeenth of November, 1766, and appears to have ascended as far as Elk river. On the twenty-fifth of November, he had re turned to the place opposite the Minnesota, where he had left his canoe, and this stream as yet not being obstructed with ice, he commenced its as cent, with the colors of Great Britain flying at the stern of his canoe. There is no doubt that he entered this river, but how far he explored it cannot be ascertained. He speaks of the Rapids near Shakopay, and asserts that he went as far as two hundred miles beyond Mendota. He re marks: \"Ten miles. below the Falls of St. Anthony, the river St. Pierre, called by the natives Wada paw Menesotor, f alls into the Mississippi from the west. It is not mentioned by Father Hennepin, though a large, fair river. This omission, I con sider, must have proceeded from a small island [Pike's] that is situated exactly in its entrance.\" When he reached the Minnesota river, the ice became so troublesome that he left his canoe in the neighborhood of what is now St. Anthony, and walked to St. Anthony, in company with a young Winnebago chief, who had never seen the \" On the seventh of December, I arrived at the utmost of my travels towards the West, where I"], [81, "SIOUX BURIAL ORATION VERSIFIED BY SCHILLER. 67 met a large party of the Naudowessie Indians, among whom I resided some months.\" and pleasing language? Why are those feet mo tionless, that a few hours ago were fleeter than the deer on yonder mountains? Why useless hang those arms, that could climb the tallest tree or draw the toughest bow? Alas, every part of that frame which we lately beheld with admira tion and wonder has now become as inanimate as it was three hundred years ago! We will not, however, bemoan thee as if thou wast forever lost to us, or that thy name would be buried in oblivion; thy soul yet lives in the great country of spirits, with those of thy nation that have gone before thee; and though we are left behind to perpetuate thy fame, we will one day join thee. After speaking of the upper bands of the Dah kotahs and their allies, he adds that he \" left the habitations of the hospitable Indians the latter end of April, 1767, but did not part from them for several days, as I was accompanied on my journey by near three hundred of them to the mouth of the river St. Pierre. At this season these bands annually go to the great cave (Day ton's Bluff) before mentioned. When he arrived at the great cave, and the In dians had deposited the remains of their deceased friends in the burial-place that stands adjacent to it, they held their great council to which he was admitted. \" Actuated by the respect we bore thee whilst living, wre now come to tender thee the last act of kindness in our power; that thy body might not he neglected on the plain, and become a prey to the beasts of the field or fowls of the air, and we will take care to lay it with those of thy predeces sors that have gone before thee; hoping at the same time that thy spirit will feed with their spirits, and be ready to receive ours when we shall also arrive at the great country of souls.\" When the Naudowessies brought their dead for interment to the great cave (St. Paul), I attempted to get an insight into the remaining burial rites, but whether it was on account of the stench which arose from so many dead bodies, or whether they chose to keep this part of their custom secret from me, I could not discover. I found, however, that they considered my curiosity as ill-timed, and therefore I withdrew. * * For this speech Carver is principally indebted to his imagination, but it is well conceived, and suggested one of Schiller's poems, which G\u0153the considered one of his best, and wished \" he had made a dozen such.\" One formality among the Naudowessies in mourning for the dead is very different from any mode I observed in the other nations through which I passed. The men, to show how great their sorrow is, pierce the flesh of their arms above the elbows with arrows, and the women cut and gash their legs with broken flints till the blood flows very plentifully. * * Sir E.

This might also in time befadlitated by canals or shorter cuts, and a communication opened by water with New York by way of the Lakes.\" On the eleventh of September, less than six months after Carver's speech at Dayton's Bluff, and the departure of a number of chiefs to the English fort at Mackinaw, Johnson writes to General Gage: \"Though I wrote to you some days ago, yet I would not mind saying something again on the score of the vast expenses incurred, and, as I understand, still incurring at Michili mackinac, chiefly on pretense of making a peace between the Sioux and Chippeweighs, with which I think we have very little to do, in good policy or otherwise.\" The subject of this sketch was also confident that a route would be discovered by way of the Minnesota river, which would open a passage to China and the English settlements in the East Indies.\" Carver having returned to England, interested Whitworth, a member of parliament, in the northern route. Had not the American Revolu tion commenced, they proposed to have built a fort at Lake Pepin, to have proceeded up the Minnesota until they found, as they supposed they could, a branch of the Missouri, and from thence, journeying over the summit of lands un til they came to a river which they called Ore gon, they expected to descend to the Pacific. Sir William Johnson, in a letter to Lord Hills borough, one of his Majesty's ministers, dated August seventeenth, 1768, again refers to the subject : Carver, in common with other travelers, had his theory in relation to the origin of the Dahko tahs. He supposed that they came from Asia. He remarks: \"But this might have been at dif ferent times and from various parts \u2014 from Tar tary, China, Japan, for the inhabitants of these places resemble each other. * * * \"Much greater part of those who go a trading are men of such circumstances and disposition as to venture their persons everywhere for extrava gant gains, yet the consequences to the public are not to be slighted, as we may be led into a general quarrel through their means. The In dians in the part adjacent to Michillmackinac have been treated with at a very great expense for some time previous. \"It is very evident that some of the names and customs of the American Indians resemble those of the Tartars, and I make no doubt but that in some future era, and this not far distant, it will be reduced to certainty that during some of the wars between the Tartars and Chinese a part of the inhabitants of the northern provinces were driven from their native country, and took refuge in some of the isles before mentioned, and from thence found their way into America. * * * \"Major Rodgers brings a considerable charge against the former for mediating a peace between some tribes of the Sioux and some of the Chippe weighs, which, had it been attended with success, would only have been interesting to a very few French, and others that had goods in that part of the Indian country, but the contrary has hap pened, and they are now more violent, and war against one another.\" \"Many words are used both by the Chinese and the Indians which have a resemblance to each other, not only in their sound, but in their signi fication. The Chinese call a slave Shungo; and the Noudowessie Indians, whose language, from their little intercourse with the Europeans, is least corrupted, term a dog Shungush [Shoan kah.J The former denominate one species of their tea Shoushong; the latter call their tobacco Shou sas-sau [Chanshasha.] Many other of the words used by the Indians contain the syllables che, chaw, and ehu, after the dialect of the Chinese.\" Though a wilderness of over one thousand miles intervened between the Falls of St. An thony and the white settlements of the English, Carver was fully impressed with the idea that the State now organized under the name of Minne sota, on account of its beauty and fertility, would attract settlers.

The remark of Humbolt in \" Cosmos\" is worthy of remembrance. \"As the structure of American idioms appears remarkably strange to nations speaking the mod em languages of Western Europe, and who readily suffer themselves to be led away by some acci dental analogies of soimd, theologians have gen erally believed that they could trace an affinity with the Hebrew, Spanish colonists with the Basque and the Enghsh, or French settlers with Gaelic, Erse, or the Bas Breton. I one day met on the coast of Peru, a Spanish naval officer and an Enghsh whaling captain, the fontier of whom declared that he had heard Basque spoken at Ta hiti; the other, Gaelic or Erse at the Sandwich Islands.\" Carver became very poor while in England, and was a clerk in a lottery-office. He died in 1780, and left a widow, two sons, and five daught ers, in New England, and also a child by another wife that he had married in Great Britain \" At the Great Cave, May 1st, 1767. \"Signed, HAWNOPAWJATIN. OTOHTGNGOOMLISHEAW. \" The original deed was never exhibited by the assignees of the heirs. By his Enghsh wife Car ver had one child, a daughter Martha, who was cared for by Sir Bichard and Lady Pearson. In time she eloped and married a sailor. A mercan tile firm in London, thinking that money could be made, induced the newly married couple, the day after the wedding, to convey the grant to them, with the understanding that they were to have a tenth of the profits. After his death a claim was urged for the land upon which the capital of Minnesota now stands' and for many miles adjacent. As there are still many persons who believe that they have some right through certain deeds purporting to be from the heirs of Carver, it is a matter worthy of an investigation. Carver says nothing in his book of travels in re lation to a grant from the Dahkotahs, but after he was buried, it was asserted that there was a deed belonging to him in existence, conveying valuable lands, and that said deed was executed at the cave now in the eastern suburbs of Saint Paul. The merchants despatched an agent by the name of Clarke to go to the Dahkotahs, and ob tain a new deed; but on his way he was murdered in the state of New York. In the year 1794, the heirs of Carver's Ameri can wife, in consideration of fifty thousand pounds sterling, conveyed their interest in the Carver grant to Edward Houghton of Vermont. In the year 1806, Samuel Peters, who had been a tory and an Episcopal minister during the Kevolu tionary war, alleges, in a petition to Congress, that he had also purchased of the heirs of Carver their rights to the grant. DEED PURPORTING TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN AT THE CAVE IN THE BLUFF BELOW ST. PAUL. \" To Jonathan Carver, a chief under the most mighty and potent George the Third, King of the English and other nations, the fame of whose warriors has reached our ears, and has now been fully told us by our good brother Jonathan, afore said, whom we rejoice to have come among us, and bring us good news from his country. Before the Senate committee, the same year, he testified as follows: \"We, chiefs of the Naudowessies, who have hereunto set our seals, do by these presents, for ourselves and heirs forever, in return for the aid and other good services done by the said Jona- \" In the year 1774, 1 arrived there (London), and met Captain Carver.

They say that if Captain Carver did ever obtain a deed or grant, it was signed by some foolish young men who were not chiefs and who were not author ized to make a grant. Among the Sioux of the River there are no such names. \" 3. They say the Indians never received any thing for the land, and they have no intention to part with it without a consideration. From my knowledge of the Indians, I am induced to think they would not make so considerable a grant, and have it to go into full effect without receiving a substantial consideration. In 1821, General Leavenworth, having made inquiries of the Dahkotahs, in relation to the alleged claim, addressed the following to the commissioner of the land office : '\u2022 4. They have, and ever have had, the pos session of the land, and intend to keep it. I know that they are very particular in making every person who wishes to cut timber on that tract obtain their permission to do so, and to ob tain payment for it. In the month of May last, some Frenchmen brought a large raft of red cedar timber out of the Chippewa River, which timber was cut on the tract before mentioned. The In dians at one of the villages on the Mississippi, where the principal chief resided, compelled the Frenchmen to land the raft, and would not per mit them to pass until they had received pay for the timber, and the Frenchmen were compelled to leave their raft with the Indians until they went to Prairie du Chien, and obtained the nec essary articles, and made the payment required.\" \" Sir: \u2014 Agreeably to your request, I have the honour to inform you what I have understood from the Indians of the Sioux Nation, as well as some facts within my own knowledge, as to what is commonly termed Carver's Grant. The grant purports to be made by the chiefs of the Sioux of the Plains, and one of the chiefs uses the sign of a serpent, and the other of a turtle, purport ing that their names are deriyed from those ani mals. \"The land lies on the east side of the Mississ ippi. The Indians do not recognize or acknowl edge the grant to be valid, and they among others assign the following reasons: On the twenty-third of January, 1823, the Com mittee of Public Lands made a report on the claim to the Senate, which, to every disinterested person, is entirely satisfactory. After stating the facts of the petition, the report continues: \"1. The Sioux of the Plains never owned a foot of land on the east side of the Mississippi. The Sioux Nation is divided into two grand di visions, viz: The Sioux of the Lake; or perhaps more literally Sioux of the River, and Sioux of the Plain. The former subsists by hunting and fishing, and usually move from place to place by water, in canoes, during the summer season, and travel on the ice in the winter, when not on their hunting excursions. The latter subsist en tirely by hunting, and have no canoes, nor do they know but little about the use of them. They reside in the large prairies west of the Mississippi, and follow the buffalo, upon which they entirely subsist; these are called Sioux of the Plain, and never owned land east of the Mississippi. \" The Rev. Samuel Peters, in his petition, fur ther states that Lefei, the present Emperor of the Sioux and Naudowessies, and Red Wing, a safchem, the heirs and successors of the two grand chiefs who signed the said deed to Captain Car ver, have given satisfactory and positive proof that they allowed their ancestors' deed to be gen uine, good, and vahd, and that Captain Carver's heirs and assigns are the owners of said territory, and may occupy it free of all molestation. The committee have examined and considered the claims thus exhibited by the petitioners, and remark that the original deed is not produced, nor any competent legal evidence offered of its execu tion ; nor is there any proof that the persons, who \" 2. The Indians say they have no knowledge of any such chiefs as those who have signed the grant to Carver, either amongst the Sioux of the"], [86, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 72 in him, yet, from some cause, that government did not think proper to do it. it is alleged made the deed, were the chiefs of said tribe, nor that (if chiefs) they had authority to grant and give away the land belonging to their tribe. The paper annexed to the petition, as a copy of said deed, has no subscribing witnesses ; and it would seem impossible, at this remote pe riod, to ascertain the important fact, that the per sons who signed the deed comprehended and understood the meaning and effect of their act. \" The territory has since become the property of the United States, and an Indian grant not good against the British government, would ap pear to be not binding uDon the United States government. \" What benefit the British government derived from the services of Captain Carver, by his trav els and residence among the Indians, that gov ernment alone could determine, and alone could judge what remuneration those services deserved. \" The want of proof as to these facts, would interpose in the way of the claimants insuperable difficulties. But, in the opinion of the committee, the claim is not such as the United States are under any obligation to allow, even if the deed were proved in legal form. \" One fact appears from the declaration of Mr. Peters, in his statement in writing, among the papers exhibited, namely, that the British gov ernment did give Captain Carver the sum of one thousand three hundred and seventy-five pounds six shillings and eight pence sterling. To the United States, however, Captain Carver rendered no services which could be assumed as any equit able ground for the support of the petitioners' claim. \" The British government, before the time when the alleged deed bears date, had deemed it pru dent and necessary for the preservation of peace with the Indian tribes under their sovereignty, protection and dominion, to prevent British sub jects from purchasing lands from the Indians, and this rule of policy was made known and en forced by the proclamation of the king of Great Britain, of seventh October, 1763, which contains an express prohibition. \"The committee being of opinion that the United States are not bound in law and equity to confirm the said alleged Indian grant, recom mend the adoption of the resolution: \" Captain Carver, aware of the law, and know ing that such a contract could not vest the legal title in him, apphed to the British government to ratify and confirm the Indian grant, and, though it was competent for that government then to confirm the grant, and vest the title of said land \" ' Resolved, That the prayer of the petitioners ought not to be granted.\" ' Lord Palmerston stated in 1839, that no trace could be found in the records of the British office of state papers, showing any ratification of the Carver grant."], [87, "EXPLORATIONS BY LIEUTENANT Z.

The main building was sixty by twenty-five feet, and one and a half story In height, where resided the Director of the fur trade of the Fond du Lac department of the North west Company. In the centre was a small store, twelve and a half feet square, and near the main gate was flagstaff fifty feet in height, from which used to float the flag of Great Britain. At the beginning of the present century, the region now known as Minnesota, contained no white men, except a few engaged in the fur trade. In the treaty effected by Hon. John Jay, Great Britain agreed to withdraw her troops from all posts and places within certain boundary hnes, on or before the first of June, 1796, but all Brit ish settlers and traders might remain for one year, and enjoy all their former privileges, with out being obliged to be citizens of the United States of America. William Morrison was, in 1802, the trader at Leech Lake, and in 1804 he was at Elk Lake, the source of the Mississippi, thirty-two years after wards named by Schoolcraft, Lake Itasca. The entire force of the Northwest Company, west of Lake Superior, in 1805, consisted of three accountants, nineteen clerks, two interpreters, eighty-five canoe men, and with them were twenty-nine Indian or half-breed women, and about fifty children. In the year 1800, the trading posts of Minnesota were chiefly held by the Northwest Company, and their chief traders resided at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, and Fon du Lac, on St. Louis River. In the year 1794, this company built a stockade one hundred feet square, on the southeast end of Sandy Lake. There were bastions pierced for small arms, in the southeast and in the northwest corner. The pickets which surrounded the post were thirteen feet high. On the north side there was a gate ten by nine feet ; on the west side, one six by five feet, and on the east side a third gate six by five feet. Travelers entering the main gate, saw on the left a one story building twenty feet square, the residence of the superintendent, and on the left of the east gate, a building twenty- five by fifteen, the quarters of the voyageurs. Entering the western gate, on the left was a stone house, twenty by thirty feet, and a house twenty by forty feet, used as a store, and a workshop, and a residence for clerks. On the south shore of Leech Lake there was another establishment, a httle larger. The stockade was one hundred On the seventh of May, 1800, the Northwest Territory, which included all of the western country east of the Mississippi, was divided. The portion not designated as Ohio, was organ ized as the Territory of Indiana. On the twentieth of December, 1803, the province of Louisiana, of which that portion of Minnesota west of the Mississippi was a part, was officially delivered up by the French, who had just obtained it from the Spaniards, accord ing to treaty stipulations. To the transfer of Louisiana by France, after twenty days' possession, Spain at first objected ; but in 1804 withdrew all opposition. President Jefferson now deemed it an object of paramount importance for the United States to explore the country so recently acquired, and make the acquaintance of the tribes residing therein ; and steps were taken for an expedition to the upper Mississippi. Early in March, 1804, Captain Stoddard, of the United States army, arrived at St. Louis, the agent of the French Republic, to receive from"], [88, "74 EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. the Spanish authorities the possession of the country, which he immediately transferred to the United States. ber of the early Minnesota Legislative assem blies. On the eighth of the month Lieutenant Pike left Prairie du Chien, in two batteaux, with Sergeant Henry Kennerman, Corporals William E. Mack and Samuel Bradley, and ten privates. As the old settlers, on the tenth of March, saw the ancient flag of Spain displaced by that of the United States, the tears coursed down their cheeks. At La Crosse, Frazer, of Prairie du Chien, overtook him, and at Sandy point of Lake Pepin he found a trader, a Scotchman by the name of Murdoch Cameron, with his son, and a young man named John Rudsdell. On the twonty- first he breakfasted with the Kaposia band of Sioux, who then dwelt at the marsh below Day- ton's Bluff, a few miles below St. Paul. The same day he passed three miles from Mendota the encampment of J. B. Faribault, a trader and native of Lower Canada, then about thirty years of age, in which vicinity he continued for more than fifty years. He married Pelagie the daugh- ter of Francis Kinnie by an Indian woman, and his eldest son, Alexander, born soon after Pike's visit, was the founder of the town of Faribault. On the twentieth of the same month, the terri tory of Upper Louisiana was constituted, com prising the present states of Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, and a large portion of Minnesota. On the eleventh of January, 1805, the terri tory of Michigan was organized. The first American officer who visited Minne sota, on business of a public nature, was one who was an ornament to his profession, and in energy and endurance a true representative of the citi zens of the United States. We refer to the gallant Zebulon Montgomery Pike, a native of New Jersey, who afterwards fell in battle at York, Upper Canada, and whose loss was justly mourned by the whole nation. When a young lieutenant, he was ordered by General Wilkinson to visit the region now known as Minnesota, and expel the British traders who were found violating the laws of the United States, and form alliances with the Indians. With only a few common soldiers, he was obliged to do the work of several men. At times he would precede his party for miles to reconnoitre, and then he would do the duty of hunter. Arriving at the confluence of the Minnosota and the Mississippi Rivers, Pike and his soldiers encamped on the Northeast point of the island which still bears his name. The next day was Sunday, and he visited Cameron, at his trading post on the Minnesota River, a short distance above Mendota. On Monday, the 23d of September, at noon, he held a Council with the Sioux, under a cover- ing made by suspending sails, and gave an ad- mirable talk, a portion of which was as follows : I \" Brothers, I am happy to meet you here, at this council fire which your father has sent me to kindle, and to take you by the hands, as our chil- dren. We having but lately acquired from the Spanish, the extensive territory of Louisiana, our general has thought proper to send out a number of his warriors to visit all his red children ; to tell them his will, and to hear what request they may have to make of their father. I am happy the choice fell on me to come this road, as I find my brothers, the Sioux, ready to listen to my words. During the day he would perform the part of surveyor, geologist, and astronomer, and at night,' though hungry and fatigued, his lofty enthu siasm kept him awake until he copied the notes, and plotted the courses of the day. On the 4th day of September, 1805, Pike ar rived at Prairie du Chien, from St. Louis, and was politely treated by three traders, all born un der the flag of the United States. One was named Wood, another Frazer, a native of Vermont, who, when a young man became a clerk of one Blakely, of Montreal, and thus became a fur trader. The third was Henry Fisher, a captain of the Militia, and Justice of the Peace, whose wife was a daughter of Goutier de Verville. Fisher was said to have been a nephew of Pres dent Monroe, and later in life traded at the sources of the Minnesota. One of his daughters was the mother of Joseph Rolette, Jr., a mem- \" Brothers, it is the wish of our government to establish military posts on the Upper Mississippi, at such places as might be thought expedient.

It was with difficulty that the chiefs signed the following agreement; not that they objected to the lan guage, but because they thought their word should be taken, without any mark ; but Pike overcame their objection, by saying that he wished them to sign it on his account. \"Sept. 26th, Thursday. \u2014 Embarked atthe usual hour, and after much labor in passing through the rapids, arrived at the foot of the Falls about three or four o'clock ; unloaded my boat, and had the principal part of her cargo carried over the portage.

This business, closing and sealing, appeared like a last adieu to the eivihzed world. Sent a large packet to the General, and a letter to Mrs. Pike, with a short note to Mr. Frazer. Two young Indians brought my flag across by land, who ar rived yesterday, just as we came in sight of the Fall.

Sept. 30th, Monday. \u2014 Loaded my boat, moved over and encamped on the Island. The large boats loading likewise, we went over and put on board. In the mean time, I took a survey of the Falls, Portage, etc. If it be possible to pass the Falls in high water, of which I am doubtful, it must be on the East side, about thirty yards from shore ; as there are three layers of rocks, one be low the other. The pitch off of either, is not more than five feet ; but of this I can say more on my return. Sept. 28th, Saturday.\u2014 Brought my barge over, and put her in the river above the Falls. While we were engaged with her three-fourths miles from camp, seven Indians painted black, appeared on the heights. We had left our guns at the camp and were entirely defenceless. It occurred. to me that they were the small party of Sioux who were obstinate, and would go to war, when the other part of the bands came in; these they proved to be ; they were better armed than any I had ever seen; having guns, bows, arrows, clubs, spears, and some of them even a case of pistols. I was at that time giving my men a dram ; and giving the cup of liquor to the first, he drank it off ; but I was more cautious with the remainder. I sent my interpreter to camp with them, to wait my coming ; wishing to purchase one ot their war clubs, it being made of elk horn, and decorated with inlaid work. This and a set of bows and arrows I wished to get as a curiosity. But the liquor I had given him began to operate, he came back for me, but refusing to go till I brought my boat, he returned, and (I suppose being offended) borrowed a canoe and crossed the river. In the afternoon got the other boat near the top of the hill, when the props gave way, and she slid all the way down to the bottom, but fortunately without injuring any person. It raining very hard, we left her. Killed one goose and a racoon. On the tenth of October, the expedition reached some 'arge island below Sauk Rapids, where in 1797, Porlier and Joseph Renville had wintered. Six days after this, he reached the Rapids in Morrison county, which still bears his name, and he writes: \"When we arose in the morning, found that snow had fallen during the night, the ground was covered and it continued to snow. This, indeed, was but poor encourage ment for attacking the Rapids, in which we were certain to wade to our necks. I was determined, however, if possible to make la riviere de Cor beau, [Crow Wing River], the highest point was made by traders in their bark canoes. We em barked, and after four hours work, became so benumbed with cold that our limbs were perfectly useless. We put to shore on the opposite side of the river, about two-thirds of the way up the rapids. Built a large fire ; and then discovered that our boats were nearly half full of water; both having sprung large leaks so as to obhge me to keep three hands bailing. My sergeant (Ken nerman) one of the stoutest men I ever knew, broke a blood-vessel and vomited nearly two quarts of blood. One of my corporals (Bradley) also evacuated nearly a pint of blood, when he attempted to void his urine.

This day I had"], [91, "PIKE'S BLOCK HOUSE NEAR SWAN RIVER. 77 ing themselves to obey my orders. After we had breakfast and refreshed ourselves, we went down to our boats on the rocks, where I was obliged to leave them. I then informed my men that we would return to the camp and there leave some of the party and our large boats. This informa tion was pleasing, and the attempt to reach the camp soon accomplished. My reasons for this step have partly been already stated. The nec essity of unloading and refitting my boats, the beauty and convenience of the spot for building huts, the fine pine trees for peroques, and the quantity of game, were additional inducements. We immediately unloaded our boats and secured their cargoes. In the evening I went out upon a small, but beautiful creek, which emptied into the Falls, for the purpose of selecting pine trees to make canoes. Saw five deer, and killed one buck weighing one hundred and thirty-seven pounds. By my leaving men at this place, and from the great quantities of game in its vicinity, I was ensured plenty of provision for my return voyage. In the party left behind was one hunter, to be continually employed, who would keep our stock of salt provisions good. Distance two hundred and thirty-three and a half miles above the Falls of St. Anthony. During the next month he hunted the buffalo which were then in that vicinity. On the third of December he received a visit from Robert Dickson, afterwards noted in the history of the country, who was then trading about sixty miles below, on the Mississippi. On the tenth of December with some sleds he continued his journey northward, and on the last day of the year passed Pine River. On the third of January, 1806, he reached the trading post at Red Cedar, now Cass Lake, and was quite indig nant at finding the British flag floating from the staff. The night after this his tent caught on fire, and he lost some valuable and necessary clcthing.

They have also beaver, deer, and moose ; but the pro vision they chiefly depend upon is wild oats, of which they purchase great quantities from the savages, giving at the rate of about one dollar and a half per bushel. But flour, pork, and salt, are almost interdicted to persons not principals in the trade. Flour sells at half a dollar ; salt a dollar ; pork eighty cents ; sugar half a dollar ; and tea four dollars and fifty cents per pound. The sugar is obtained from the Indians, and is made from the maple tree.\" Having left his large boats and some soldiers at this point, he proceeded to the vicinity of Swan River where he erected a block house, and on the thirty-first of October he writes: \"En closed my httle work completely with pickets.

I was therefore obliged to omit mentioning every particular relative to the rascal who fired on my sentinel, and of the scoun drel who broke the Fols Avoins' canoes, and threatened my life; the interpreters, however, in formed them that I wanted some of their princi pal chiefs to go to St. Louis; and that those who thought proper might descend to the prairie, where we would give them more explicit infor mation. They all smoked out of the Santeur's pipe, excepting three, who were painted black, and were some of those who lost their relations last winter. I invited the Fils de Pinchow, and the son of the Killeur Rouge, to come over and sup with me; when Mr. Dickson and myself en deavored to explain what I intended to have said to them, could I have made myself understood; that at the prairie we would have all things ex plained; that I was desirous of making a better report of them than Captain Lewis could do from their treatment of him. The former of those savages wras the person who remained around my post all last winter, and treated my men so well; they endeavored to excuse their people. A Mr. Anderson, in the employ of Robert Dickson, was residing at the west end of the lake. Awhile here he hoisted the American flag in the fort. The Enghsh yacht still flying at the top of the flagstaff, he directed the Indians and his sol diers to shoot at it. They soon broke the iron pin to which it was fastened, and it fell to the ground. He was informed by a venerable old Ojibway chief, called Sweet, that the Sioux dwelt there when he was a youth. On the tenth of February, at ten o'clock, he left Leech Lake with Corporal Bradley, the trader MeGillis and two of Iris men, and at sunset arrived at Red Cedar, now Cass Lake. At this place, in 1798, Thompson, employed by the Northwest Company for three years, in topographical surveys, made some ob servations. He believed that a line from the Lake of the Woods would touch the sources of the Mississippi. Pike, at this point, was very kindly treated by a Canadian named Roy, and his Ojibway squaw. On his return home, he reached Clear River on the seventh of April, where he found his canoe and men, and at night was at Grand Rapids, Dickson's trading post. He talked until four o'clock the next morning with this person and another trader named Porlier. He forbade while there, the traders Greignor [Grig non] and La Jennesse, to sell any more liquor to Indians, who had become very drunken and un ruly. On the tenth he again reached the Falls of Saint Anthony. He writes in his journal as follows : \"April 12th, Saturday.\u2014 Embarked early. Al though my interpreter had been frequently up the river, he could not tell me where the cave (spoken of by Carver) could be found; we carefully sought for it, but in vain. At the Indian village, a few miles below St. Peter's, we were about to pass a few lodges, but on receiving a very partic ular invitation to come on shore, we landed, and were received in a lodge kindly; they presented us sugar. I gave the proprietor a dram, and was about to depart when he demanded a kettle of liquor; on being refused, and after I had left the shore, he told me he did not hke the arrange ments, and that he would go to war this summer. I directed the interpreter to tell him that if I returned to St. Peter's with the troops, I would settle that affair with him. On our arrival at the St. Croix, I found the Pettit Corbeau with his people, and Messrs. Frazer and Wood. We had a conference, when the Pettit Corbeau made April 11th, Friday. \u2014 Although it snowed very hard we brought over both boats, and descended the river to the island at the entrance of the St. Peter's. I sent to the chiefs and informed them I had something to communicate to them. The Fils de Pincho immediately waited on me, and informed me that he would provide a place for the purpose. About sundown I was sent for and introduced into the council-house, where I found a great many chiefs of the Sussitongs, Gens de Feuilles, and the Gens du Lac. The Yanctongs had not yet come down. They were all awaiting for my arrival. There were about one hundred lodges, or six hundred people; we were saluted on our crossing the river with ball as usual. The council-house was two large lodges, capable of"], [93, "CAMERON SELLS LIQUOR TO INDIANS. 79 many apologies for the misconduct of his people; he represented to us the different manners in which the young warriors had been inducing him to go to war; that he had been much blamed for dismissing his party last fall; but that he was de termined to adhere as far as lay in his power to our instructions; that he thought it most prudent to remain here and restrain the warriors. He then presented me with a beaver robe and pipe, and his message to the general. That he was determined to preserve peace, and make the road clear; also a remembrance of his promised medal. I made a reply, calculated to confirm him in his good intentions, and assured him that he should not be the less remembered by his father, although not present. I was informed that, notwithstand ing the instruction of his license, and my par ticular request, Murdoch Cameron had taken liquor and sold it to the Indians on the river St. Peter's, and that his partner below had been equally imprudent. I pledged myself to prose cute them according to law; for they have been the occasion of great confusion, and of much injury to the other traders. This day met a canoe of Mr. Dickson's loaded with provisions, under the charge of Mr. Anderson, brother of the Mr. Anderson at Leech Lake. He politely offered me any provision he had on board (for which Mr. Dickson had given me an order), but not now being in want, I did not accept of any. This day, for the first time, I observed the trees beginning to bud, and indeed the climate seemed to have changed very materially since we passed the Falls of St. Anthony.\" The strife of political parties growing out of the French Revolution, and the declaration of war against Great Britain in the year 1812, post poned the military occupation of the Upper Mississippi by the United States of America, for several years."], [94, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 80 XIII.

Notwithstanding the professions of friendship made to Pike, in the second war with Great Brit ain, Dickson and others were found bearing arms against the Republic. A year after Pike left Prairie du Chien, it was evident, that under some secret influence, the Indian tribes were combining against the United States. In the year 1809, Nicholas Jarrot declared that the British traders were furnishing the sav ages with guns for hostile purposes. On the first of May, 1812, two Indians were apprehended at Chicago, who were on their way to meet Dickson at Green Bay. They had taken the precaution to hide letters in their moccasins, and bury them in the ground, and were allowed to proceed after a brief detention. Frazer, of Prairie du Chien, who had been with Pike at the Council at the mouth of the Minnesota River, was at the port age of the Wisconsin when the Indians dehvered these letters, which stated that the British flag would soon be flying again at Mackinaw. At Green Bay , the celebrated warrior, Black Hawk, was placed in charge of the Indians who were to aid the British. The American troops at Macki naw were obliged, on the seventeenth of July, 1812, to capitulate without firing a single gun. One who was made prisoner, writes from Detroit to the Secretary of War : On the first of May, 1814, Governor Clark, with two hundred men, left St. Louis, to build a fort at the junction of the Wisconsin and Missis sippi. Twenty days before he arrived at Prairie du Chien, Dickson had started for Mackinaw with a band of Dahkotahs and Winnebagoes. The place was left in command of Captain Deace and the Mackinaw Fencibles. The Dahkotahs refusing to co-operate, when the Americans made their appearance they fled. The Americans took possession of the old Mackinaw house, in which they found nine or ten trunks of papers belong ing to Dickson. From one they took the follow ing extract : \"'Arrived, from below, a few Winnebagoes with scalps. Gave them tobacco, six pounds powder and six pounds ball.' \" A fort was immediately commenced on the site of the old residence of the late H. L. Dous man, which was composed of two block-houses in the angles, and another on the bank of the river, with a subterranean communication. In honor of the governor of Kentucky it was named \"Shelby.\" \" The persons who commanded the Indians are Robert Dickson, Indian trader, and John Askin, Jr., Indian agent, and his son. The latter two were painted and dressed after the manner of the Indians. Those who commanded the Canadians are John Johnson, Crawford, Pothier, Armitinger, La Croix, Rolette, Franks, Living ston, and other traders, some of whom were lately concerned in smuggling British goods into the The fort was in charge of Lieutenant Perkins, and sixty rank and file, and two gunboats, each of which carried a six-pounder; and several howitzers were commanded by Captains Yeiser, Sullivan, and Aid-de-camp Kennerly. The traders at Mackinaw, learning that the Americans had built a fort at the Prairie, and knowing that as long as they held possession they would be cut off from the trade with the"], [95, "LOYALTY OF FARIBAULT AND THE ONE-EYED SIOUX. 81 Dahkotahs, immediately raised an expedition to capture the garrison. nation, he ascended the Missouri under the pro tection of the distinguished trader, Manual Lisa, as far as the Au Jacques or James River, and from thence struck across the country, enlisting the Sioux in favour of the United States, and at length arrived at Prairie du Chien. On his arri val, Dickson accosted him, and inquired from whence he came, and what was his business ; at the same time rudely snatching his bundle from his shoulder, and searching for letters, The \" one-eyed warrior \" told him that he was from St. Louis, and that he had promised the white chiefs there that he would go to Prairie du Chien, and that he had kept his promise The captain was an old trader by the name of McKay, and under him was a sergeant of ar tillery, with a brass six-pounder, and three or four volunteer companies of Canadian voyageurs, officered by Captains Griguon, Rolette and An derson, with Lieutenants Brisbois and Duncan Graham, all dressed in red coats, with a number of Indians. The Americans had scarcely completed their rude fortification, before the British force, guid ed by Joseph Rolette, Sr., descended in canoes to a point on the \"Wisconsin, several miles from the Prairie, to which they marched in battle array. McKay sent a flag to the Fort demanding a surrender. Lieutenant Perkins replied that he would defend it to the last. Dickson then placed him in confinement in Fort McKay, as the garrison was called by the British, and ordered him to divulge what infor mation he possessed, or he would put him to death. But the faithful fellow said he would impart nothing, and that he was ready for death if he wished to kill him. Finding that confine ment had no effect, Dickson at last hberated him. He then left, and visited the bands of Sioux on the Upper Mississippi, with which he passed the winter. When he returned in the spring, Dick son had gone to Mackinaw, and Capt. A. Bulger, of the Royal New Foundland Regiment, was in command of the fort. A fierce encounter took place, in which the Americans were worsted. The officer was wounded, several men were killed and one of their boats captured, so that it became necessary to retreat to St. Louis. Fort Shelby after its capture, was called Fort McKay. Among the traders a few remained loyal, es pecially Provencalle and J. B. Faribault, traders among the Sioux. Faribault was a prisoner among the British at the time Lieut. Col. Wm. McKay was preparing to attack Fort Shelby, and he refused to perform any service, Faribault's wife, who was at Prairie du Chien, not knowing that her husband was a prisoner in the hands of the advancing foe, fled with others to the Sioux village, where is now the city of Winona. Fari bault was at length released on parole and re turned to his trading post. On the twenty-third of May, 1815, Capt. Bul ger, wrote from Fort McKay to Gov. Clark at St. Louis : \" Official intelligence of peace reached me yesterday. I propose evacuating the fort, taking with me the guns captured in the fort. * * * * I have not the smallest hesitation in declaring my decided opinion, that the presence of a detachment of British and United States troops at the same time, would be the means of embroiling one party or the other in a fresh rup ture with the Indians, which I presume it is the wish of both governments to, avoid.\" Pike writes of his flag, that \"being in doubt whether it had been stolen by the Indians, or had fallen overboaid and floated away, I sent for my friend the Orignal Leve.\" He also calls the Chief, Rising Moose, and gives his Sioux name Tahamie. He was one of those, who in 1805, signed the agreement, to surrender land at the junction of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers to the United States. He had but one eye, having lost the other when a boy, belonged to the Wapasha band of the Sioux, and proved true to the flag which had waved on the day he sat in council with Pike. The next month the \" One-Eyed Sioux,\" with three other Indians and a squaw, visited St. Louis, and he informed Gov. Clark, that the British commander left the cannons in the fort when he evacuated, but in a day or two came back, took the cannons, and fired the fort with the American flag flying, but that he rushed in and saved it from being burned. From this time, the British flag ceased to float in the Valley of the Missis sippi. In the fall of 1814, with another of the same c>"], [96, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 82 CHAPTER XIV.

In the midst of this beautiful scenery is situated a village of the Sioux Indians, on an extensive lawn called the Aux Aisle Prairie ; at which we lay by for a short time. On our arrival the Indians hoisted two American flags, and we returned the compliment by discharging our blunderbuss and pistols. They then fired several guns ahead of us by way of a salute, after which we landed and were received with much friend ship. The name of their chief is Wauppaushaw, or the Leaf, commonly called by a name of the same import in French, La Feuille, or La Fye, as it is pronounced in English. He is considered one of the most honest and honorable of any of the Indians, and endeavors to inculcate into the minds of his people the sentiments and principles adopted by himself. He was not at home at the time I called, and I had no opportunity of seeing him. The Indians, as I suppose, with the ex pectation that I had something to communicate to them, assembled themselves at the place where I landed and seated themselves upon the grass. I inquired if their chief was at home, and was answered in the negative. I then told them I should be very glad to see him, but as he was absent I would call on him again in a few days when I should return. I further told them that cur father, the new President, wished to ob tain some more information relative to his red children, and that I was on a tour to acquire any intelligence he might stand in need of. With this they appeared well satisfied, and permitted Mr. Hempstead and myself to go through their village.

Major Stephen H. Long, of the Engineer Corps of the United States Army, learning that there was little or no danger to be apprehended from the Indians, determined to ascend to the Falls of Saint Anthony, in a six-oared skiff presented to him by Governor Clark, of Saint Louis. His party consisted of a Mr. Hempstead, a native of New London, Connecticut, who had been hving at Prairie du Chien, seven soldiers, and a half breed interpreter, named Roque. A bark canoe accompanied them, containing Messrs. Gun and King, grandsons of the celebrated traveler, Jona than Carver. On the ninth ot July, 1817, the expedition left Prairie du Chien, and on the twelfth arrived at \" Trempe a l'eau.\" He writes : \" When we stopped for breakfast, Mr. Hemp stead and myself ascended a high peak to take a view of the country. It is known by the name of the Kettle Hill, having obtained this appella tion from the circumstance of its having numer ous piles of stone on its top, most of them fragments of the rocky stratifications which constitute the principal part of the hill, but some of them small piles made by the Indians. These at a distance have some similitude of kettle;*; arranged along upon the ridge and sides of the hill. From this, or almost any other eminence in its neighborhood, the beauty and grandeur of the prospect would baffle the skill of the most inge nious pencil to depict, and that of the most ac complished pen to describe.

I accepted of his services, and he was ready to attend me on the tour in a very short time. When we hove in *ight the Indians were engaged in a ceremony called the Bear Dance; a ceremony which they are in the habit of performing when any young man is desirous of bringing himself into particu lar notice, and is considered a kind of initiation into the state of manhood. I went on to the ground where they had their performances, which were ended sooner than usual on account of our arrival. There was a kind of flag made of fawn skin dressed with the hair on, suspended on a pole. Upon the flesh side of it were drawn certain rude figures indicative of the dream which it is necessary the young man should have dreamed, before he can be considered a proper candidate for this kind of initiation ; with this a pipe was suspended by way of sacrifice. Two arrows were stuck up at the foot of the pole, and fragments of painted feathers, etc., were strewed about the ground near to it. These per tained to the religious rites 'attending the cere mony, which consists in bewailing and self-mor tification, that the Good Spirit may be induced to pity them and succor their undertaking. his assailants, and even to taking the life of any of them. \" This part of the ceremony is performed three times, that the bear may escape from his den and return to it again through three of the ave- nues communicating with V . On being hunted from the fourth or last avenue, the bear must make his escape through all hL pursuers, if pos- sible, and flee to the woods, whei ht. t j remain through the day. This, however, is seldom or never accomplished, as all the young men exert themselves to the utmost in order to trap him. When caught, he must retire to r lodge erected for his reception in the field, where he is to be se- cluded from all society through the day, except one of his particular friends whom he is allowed to take with him as an attendant. Here he smokes and performs various other rites which superstition has led the Indians to believe are sa- cred. After this ceremony is ended, the young Indian is considered qualified to act any part as an efficient member of their community. The Indian who has the good fortune to catch the bear and overcome him when endeavoring to make his escape to the woods, is considered a candidate for preferment, and is on the first suit- able occasion appointed the leader of a small war party, in order that he may further have an op- portunity to test his prowess and perform more essential service in behalf of his nation. It is accordingly expected that he will kill some of their enemies and return with their scalps. I re- gretted very much that I had missed the oppor- tunity of witnessing this ceremony, which is never performed except when prompted by the particular dreams of one or other of the young men, who is never complimented twice in the same manner on account of his dreams.\" \" At the distance of two or three hundred yards from the flag, is an excavation which they call the bear's hole, prepares1, for the occasion. It is about two feet deep, and has two ditches, about one foot deep, leading across it at right an- gles. The young hero of the farce places himself in this hole, to be hunted by the rest of the young men, all of whom on this occasion are dressed in their best attire and painted in their neatest style. The hunters approach the hole in the direction of one oi\" the ditches, and discharge then guns, which were previously loaded for the purpose witli. blank cartridges, at the one who acts the part of the bear; whereupon he leaps from his den, having a hoop in each hand, and a wooden lance ; the hoops serving as forefeet to aid him in characterizing his part, and his lance to defend him from his assailants. Thus accoutred he dances round the place, exhibiting various feats of activity, while the other Indians pursue him and endeavor to trap him as he attempts to re turn to his den, to effect which he is privileged to use any violence he pleases with impunity against On the sixteenth he approached the vicinity of where is now the capital of Minnesota, and writes : \" Set sail at half past four this morning with a favorable breeze. Passed an Indian bury ing ground on our left, the first that I have seen surrounded by a fence. In the centre a pole is erected, at the foot of which rehgious rites are performed at the burial of an Indian, by the particular friends and relatives of the deceased. Upon the pole a flag is suspended when any per son of extraordinary merit, or one who is very much beloved, is buried. In the enclosure were"], [98, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 84 \"Five miles above this is the Fountain Cave, on the same side of the river, formed in the same kind of sandstone but of a more pure and fine quahty. It is far more curious and interesting than the former. The entrance of the cave is a large winding hall about one hundred and fifty feet in length, fifteen feet in width, and from eight to sixteen feet in height, finely arched overhead, and nearly perpendicular. Next suc ceeds a narrow passage and difficult of entrance, which opens into a most beautiful circular room, finely arched above, and about forty feet in di ameter. The cavern then continues a meander ing course, expanding occasionally into small rooms of a circular form. We penetrated about one hundred and fifty yards, till our candles began to fail us, when we returned. To beauti fy and embellish the scene, a fine crystal stream flows through the cavern, and cheers the lone some dark retreat with its enlivening murmurs. The temperature of the water in the cave was 46 deg., and that of the air 60 deg. Entering this cold retreat from an atmosphere of 89 deg., I thought it not prudent to remain in it long enough to take its several dimensions and me ander its courses ; particularly as we had to wade in water to our knees in many places in order to penetrate as far as we went. The fountain sup plies an abundance of water as fine as I ever drank. This cavern I was informed by my interpreter, has been discovered but a few years. That the Indians formerly living in its neighbor hood knew nothing of it till within six years past. That it is not the same as that described by Carver is evident, not only from this circum stance, but also from the circumstance that in stead of a stagnant pool, and only one accessible room of a very different form, this cavern has a brook running through it, and at least four rooms in succession, one after the other. Car ver's Cave is fast filling up with sand, so that no water is now found in it, whereas this, from the very nature of the place, must be enlarging, as the fountain will carry along with its current all the sand that falls into it from the roof and sides of the cavern.\" two scaffolds erected also, about six feet high and six feet square. Upon one of them were two coffins containing dead bodies. Passed a Sioux village on our right containing fourteen cabins. The name of the chief is the Petit Corbeau, or Little Raven. The Indians were all absent on a hunting party up the River St. Croix, which is but a httle distance across the country from the village. Of this we were very glad, as this band are said to be the most notorious beggars of all the Sioux on the Mississippi. One of their cabins is furnished with loop holes, and i3 sit uated so near the water that the opposite side of the river is within musket-shot range from the building. By this means the Petit Corbeau is enabled to exercise a command over the pass age of the river and has in some instances com pelled traders to land with their goods, and in duced them, probably through fear of offending him, to bestow presents to a considerable amount, before he would suffer them to pass. The cabins are a kind of stockade buildings, and of a better appearance than any Indian dwellings I have before met with. \" Two miles above the village, on the same side of the river, is Carver's Cave, at which we stopped to breakfast. However interesting it may have been, it does not possess that character in a very high degree at present. We descend ed it with lighted candles to its lower extremity. The entrance is very low and about eight feet broad, so that a man in order to enter it must be completely prostrate. The angle of descent within the cave is about 25 deg. The flooring is an inclined plane of quicksand, formed of the rock in which the cavern is formed. The dist ance from its entrance to its inner extremity is twenty-four paces, and the width in the broadest part about nine, and its greatest height about seven feet. In shape it resembles a bakers's oven. The cavern was once probably much more ex tensive. My interpreter informed me that, since his remembrance, the entrance was not less than ten feet high and its length far greater than at present. The rock in which it is formed is a very white sandstone, so friable that the frag ments of it will almost crumble to sand when taken into the hand. A few yards below the mouth of the cavern is a very copious spring of fine water issuing from the bottom of the cliff. On the night of the sixteenth, he arrived at the Falls of Saint Anthony and encamped on the east shore just below the cataract. He writes in his journal :"], [99, "DESCRIPTION OF FALLS OF SAINT ANTHONY. 85 \"The place where we encamped last night need- the right channel also. The rapids commence several hundred yards above the cataract and continue about eight miles below. The fall of the water, beginning at the head of the rapids, and extending two hundred and sixty rods down the river to where the portage road commences, below the cataract is, according to Pike, fifty- eight feet. If this estimate be correct the whole fall from the head to the foot of the rapids, is not probably much less than one hundred feet. But as I had no instrument sufficiently accurate to level, where the view must necessarily be pretty extensive, I took no pains to ascertain the extent of the fall. The mode I adopted to ascertain the height of a cataract, was to suspend a line and plummet from the table rock on the south side of the river, which at the same time had very little water passing over it as the river was unusually low. The rocky formations at this place were arranged in the following order, from the surface downward. A coarse kind of lime- stone in thin strata containing considerable silex; a kind of soft friable stone of a greenish color and slaty fracture, probably containing lime, aluminum and silex ; a very beautiful satratifica- tion of shell limestone, in thin plates, extremely regular in its formation and containing a vast number of shells, all apparently of the same kind. This formation constitutes the Table Rock of the cataract. The next in order is a white or yellowish sandstone, so easily crumbled that it deserves the name of a sandbank rather than that of a rock. It is of various depths, from ten to fifty or seventy-five feet, and is of the same char- acter with that found at the caves before des- cribed. The next in order is a soft friable sand- stone, of a greenish color, similar to that resting upon the shell limestone. These stratifications occupied the whole space from the low water mark nearly to the top of the bluffs. On the east, or rather north side of the river, at the Falls, are high grounds, at the distance of half a mile from the river, considerably more elevated than the bluffs, and of a hilly aspect. ed no embellishment to render it romantic in the highest degree. The banks on both sides of the river are about one hundred feet high, decorated with trees and shrubbery of various kinds. The post oak, hickory, walnut, linden, sugar tree, white birch, and the American box ; also various evergreens, such as the pine, cedar, juniper, etc., added their embellishments to the scene. Amongst the shrubery were the prickly ash, plum, and cherry tree, the gooseberry, the black and red raspberry, the chokeberry, grape vine, etc. There were also various kinds of herbage and flowers, among which were the wild parsley, rue, spikenard, etc., red and white roses, morning glory and various other handsome flowers. A few yards below us was a beautiful cascade of fine spring water, pouring down from a project ing precipice about one hundred feet bight. On our left was the Mississippi hurrying through its channel with great velocity, and about three quarters of a mile above us, in plain view, was the majestic cataract of the Falls of St. Anthony. The murmuring of the cascade, the roaring of the river, and the thunder of the cataract, all contrib uted to render the scene the most interesting and magnificient of any I ever before witnessed.\" \"The perpendicular fall of the water at the cataract, was stated by Pike in his journal, as six- teen and a half feet, which I found to be true by actual measurement. To this height, however, four or five feet may be added for the rapid des- cent which immediately succeeds to the perpen- dicular fall within a few yards below. Immedi- ately at the cataract the river is divided into two parts by an island which extends considerably above and below the cataract, and is about five hundred yards long. The channel on the right side of the Island is about three times the width of that on the left. The quanity of water pass- ins through them is not, however, in the same proportion, as about one-third part of the whole passes through the left channel. In the broadest channel, just below the cataract, is a small island also, about fifty yards in length and thirty in breadth. Both of these islands contain the same kind of rocky formation as the banks of the river, and are nearly as high. Besides these, there are immediately at the foot of the cataract, two islands of very inconsiderable size, situated in Speaking of the bluff at the confluence Od the Mississippi and Minnesota, he writes: \"A military work of considerable magnitude might be con structed on the point, and might be rendered sufficiently secure by occupying the commanding height in the rear in a suitable manner, as the"], [100, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 86 latter would control not only the point, but all the neighboring heights, to the full extent of a twelve pounder's range. The work on the point would be necessary to control the navigation of the two rivers. But without the commanding work in the rear, would be hable to be greatly annoyed from a height situated directly opposite on the other side of the Mississippi, which is here no more than about two hundred and fifty yards wide. This latter height, however, would not be eligible for a permanent post, on account of the numerous ridges and ravines situated im mediately in its rear.\""], [101, "EABLY HISTORY OF BED RIVER VALLEY. 87 CHAPTEE XV.

Bellin describes the fort on Red River, but asserts that it was abandoned because of its vicinity to Fort La Reine, on the north side of the Assinneboine, and only about nine miles by a portage, from Swan Lake. Red Lake and Red River were so called by the early French explo rers, on account of the reddish tint of the waters after a storm. The valley of the Red River of the North is not only an important portion of Minnesota, but has a most interesting history. While there is no evidence that Groselliers, the first white man who explored Minnesota, ever visited Lake Winnipeg and the Red River, yet he met the Assineboines at the head of Lake Supe rior and at Lake Nepigon, while on his way by a northeasterly trail to Hudson's Bay, and learned something of this region from them. The first person, of whom we have an account, who visited the region, was an Enghshman, who came hi 1692, by wray of York River, to Winni peg. Thomas Douglas, Earl of Selkirk, a wealthy, kind-hearted but visionary Scotch nobleman, at the commencement of the present century formed the design of planting a colony of agriculturists west of Lake Superior. In the year 1811 he obtained a grant of land from the Hudson Bay Company called Ossiniboia, which it seems strange has been given up by the people of Man itoba. In the autumn of 1812 a few Scotchmen with their families arrived at Pembina, in the Red River Valley, by way of Hudson Bay, where they passed the winter. In the winter of 1813-14 they were again at Fort Daer or Pembina. The colonists of Red River were rendered very un happy by the strife of rival trading companies. Ochagachs, or Otchaga, an intelligent Indian, in 1728, assured Pierre Gualtier de Varenne, known in history as the Sieur Verendrye, while he was stationed at Lake Nepigon, that there was a communication, largely by water, west of Lake Superior, to the Great Sea or Pacific Ocean. The rude map, drawn by this Indian, was sent to France, and is still preserved. Upon it is marked Kamanistigouia, the fort first established by Du Luth. Pigeon River is called Mantohavagane. Lac Sasakanaga is marked, and Rainy Lake is named Tecamemiouen. The river St. Louis, of Minnesota, is R. fond du L. Superior. The French geographer, Bellin, in his \" Remarks upon the map of North America,\" published in 1755, at Paris, alludes to this sketch of Ochagachs, and says it is the earliest drawing of the region west of Lake Superior, in the Depot de la Marine. In the spring of 1815, McKenzie and Morrison, traders of the Northwest company, at Sandy Lake, told the Ojibway chief there, that they would give him and his band all the goods and rum at Leech or Sandy Lakes, if they would an noy the Red River settlers. After this Verendrye, in 1737, drew a map, which remains unpublished, which shows Red Lake in Northern Minnesota, and the point of the Big Woods in the Red River Valley. There The Earl of Selkirk hearing of the distressed condition of his colony, sailed for America, and"], [102, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 88 had a bearing which suggested a different origin. By his efficiency and temperate habits, he had se cured the respect of his employers, and on the Earl of Selkirk's arrival at Red River, his attention was called to him, and in his welfare he became deeply interested. By repeated conversations with him, memories of a different kind of exist ence were aroused, and the light of other days began to brighten. Though he had forgotten his father's name, he furnished sufficient data for Selkirk to proceed with a search for his relatives. Visiting the United States in 1817, he published a circular in the papers of the Western States, which led to the identification of the man. in the fall of 1815, arrived at New York City. Proceeding to Montreal he found a messenger who had traveled on foot in mid-winter from the Red River by way of Red Lake and Fon du Lac, of Lake Superior. He sent back by this man, kind messages to the dispirited settlers, but one night he was way-laid near Fon du Lac, and robbed of his canoe and dispatches. An Ojib way chief at Sandy Lake, afterwards testified that a trader named Grant offered him rum and tobacco, to send persons to intercept a bearer of dispatches to Red River, and soon the messenger was brought in by a negro and some Indians. Failing to obtain military aid from the British authorities in Canada, Selkirk made an engagement with four officers and eighty privates, of the discharged Meuron regiment, twenty of the De Watteville, and a few of the Glengary Fencibles, which had served in the late war with the United States, to accompany him to Red River. They were to receive monthly wages for navigating the boats to Red River, to have lands assigned them, and a free passage if they wished to return. It appeared from his own statement, and those of his friends, that his name was John Tanner, the son of a minister of the gospel, who, about the year 1790, lived on the Ohio river, near the Miami. Shortly after his location there, a band of roving Indians passed near the house, and found John Tanner, then a little boy, filling his hat with walnuts from under a tree. They seized him and fled. The party was led by an Ottawa whose wife had lost a son. To compen sate for his death, the mother begged that a boy of the same age might be captured. When he reached Sault St. Marie, he received the intelligence that the colony had again been destroyed, and that Semple, a mild, amiable, but not altogether judicious man, the chief governor of the factories and territories of the Hudson Bay company, residing at Red River, had been killed. Adopted by the band, Tanner grew up an Indian in his tastes and habits, and was noted for bravery. Selkirk was successful in finding his relatives. After twenty-eight years of sepa ration, John Tanner in 1818, met his brother Edward near Detroit, and went with him to his home in Missouri. He soon left his brother, and went back to the Indians. For a time he was interpreter for Henry R. Schoolcraft, but became lazy and ill-natured, and hi 1836, skulking behind some bushes, he shot and killed Schoolcraft's brother, and fled to the wilderness, where, in 1847, he died. His son, James, was kindly treat ed by the missionaries to the Ojibways of Minne sota; but he walked in the footsteps of his father. In the year 1851, he attempted to impose upon the Presbyterian minister in Saint Paul, and, when detected, called upon the Baptist minister, who, believing him a penitent, cut a hole in the ice, and received him into the church by immer sion. In time, the Baptists found him out, when he became an Unitarian missionary, and, at last, it is said, met a death by violence. Schoolcraft, in 1832, says he saw at Leech Lake, Majegabowi, the man who had killed Gov. Semple, after he fell wounded from his horse. Before he heard of the death of Semple, the Earl of Selkirk had made arrangements to visit his colony by way of Fon du Lac, on the St. Louis River, and Red Lake of Minnesota, but he now changed his mind, and proceeded with his force to Fort William, the chief trading post of the Northwest Company on Lake Superior ; and ap prehending the principal partners, warrants of commitment were issued, and they were forward- ed to the Attorney-General of Upper Canada. While Selkirk was engaged at Fort Wilham, a party of emigrants in charge of Miles McDon nel, Governor, and Captain D'Orsomen, went forward to reinforce the colony. At Rainy Lake they obtained the guidance of a man who had all the characteristics of an Indian, and yet Lord Selkirk was in the Red River Valley"], [103, "EARL OF SELKIRK VISITS SAINT LOUIS. 89 during the summer of 181 7, and on the eighteenth of July concluded a treaty with the Crees and Saulteaux, for a tract of land beginning at the mouth of the Red River, and extending along the same as far as the Great Forks (now Grand Forks) at the mouth of Red Lake River, and along the Assinniboine River as far as Musk Rat River, and extending to the distance of six miles from Fort Douglas on every side, and likewise from Fort Daer (Pembina) and also from the Great Forks, and in other parts extending to the distance of two miles from the banks of the said rivers. Dickson, as I have before observed, is situated near the head of the St. Peter's, to which place he transports his goods from Selkirk's Red River establishment, in carts made for the purpose. The trip is performed in five days, sometimes less.

The climate was represented as \"mild and healthy.\" \" Wood either for building or fuel in the greatest plenty,\" and the country supplying \"in profusion, whatever can be re quired for the convenience, pleasure or comfort of hfe.\" Remarkable statements considering that every green thing had been devoured the year before by grasshoppers. Having restored order and confidence, attend ed by three or four persons he crossed the plains to the Minnesota River, and from thence pro ceeded to St. Louis. The Indian agent at Prairie du Chien was not pleased with Selkirk's trip through Minnesota; and on the sixth of February, 1818, wrote the Governor of Illinois under excitement, some groundless suspicions : \u2022' What do you suppose, sir, has been the re sult of the passage through my agency of this British nobleman'.1 Two entire bands, and part of a third, all Sioux, have deserted us and joined Dickson, who has distributed to them large quan tities of Indian presents, together with flags, medals, etc. Knowing this, what must have been my feelings on hearing that his lordship had met with a favourable reception at St. Louis. The newspapers announcing Ms arrival, and general Scottish appearance, all tend to discompose me ; believing as I do, that he is plotting with his friend Dickson our destruction\u2014 sharpening the savage scalping knife, and colonizing a tract of country, so\u00bbremote as that of the Red River, for the purpose, no doubt, of monopolizing the fur and peltry trade of this river, the Missouri and their waters ; a trade of the first importance to our Western States and Territories. A courier who had arrived a few days since, confirms the belief that Dickson is endeavouring to undo what I have done, and secure to the British govern ment the affections of the Sioux, and subject the Northwest Company to his lordship. * * * Under the influence of these statements, a num ber were induced to embark. In the spring of 1821, about two hundred persons assembled on the banks of the Rhine to proceed to the region west of Lake Superior.

On Wednesday, the last day of June, Col. Leav enworth and troops arrived from Green Bay, at Prairie du Chien. Scarcely had they reached this point when Charlotte Seymour, the wife of Lt. Nathan Clark, a native of Hartford, Ct., gave birth to a daughter, whose first baptismal name was Charlotte, after her mother, and the second Ouisconsin, given by the officers in view of the fact that she was born at the junction of that stream with the Mississippi.

LEAVENWORTH ARRIVES AT MENDOTA 91 the city of Minneapolis, living to do good as she has opportunity. The first sutler of the post was a Mr. Devotion. He brought with him a young man named Phi lander Prescott, who was born in lS01,at Phelps town, Ontario county, New York. At first they stopped at Mud Hen Island, in the Mississippi below the mouth of the St. Croix River. Coming up late in the year 1819, at the site of the pres ent town of Hastings they found a keel-boat loaded with supphes for the cantonment, in charge of Lieut. Oliver, detained by the ice. In June, under instructions from the War Department, Major Thomas Forsyth, connected with the office of Indian affairs, left St. Louis with two thousand dollars worth of goods to be distributed among the Sioux Indians, in accor dance with the agreement of 1805, already re ferred to, by the late General Pike. About nine o'clock of the morning of the fifth of July, he joined Leavenworth and his command at Prairie du Chien. Some time was occupied by Leavenworth awaiting the arrival of ordnance, provisions and recruits, but on Sunday morning, the eighth of August, about eight o'clock, the expedition set out for the point now known as Mendota. The flotilla was quite imposing ; there were the Colonel's barge, fourteen batteaux with ninety-eight soldiers and officers, two large canal or Mackinaw boats, filled with various stores, and Forsyth 's keel boat, containing goods and pres ents for the Indians. On the twenty-third of August, Forsyth reached the mouth of the Min nesota with his boat, and the next morning Col. Leavenworth arrived, and selecting a place at Mendota, near the present railroad bridge, he 6rdered the soldiers to cut downi trees and make a clearing. On the next Saturday Col. Leaven worth, Major Vose, Surgeon Purcell, Lieutenant Clark and the wife of Captain Gooding ivited the Falls of Saint Anthony with Forsyth, in his keel boat. Amid all the changes of the troops, Mr. Pres cott remained nearly all his life in the vicinity of the post, to which he came when a mere lad, and was at length killed in the Sioux Massacre. EVENTS OF THE YEAK 1820 111 the spring of 1820, Jean Baptiste Faribault brought up Leavenworth's horses from Prairie du Chien. The first Indian Agent at the post was a former army officer, Lawrence Taliaferro, pronounced Toliver. As he had the confidence of the Gov ernment for twenty-one successive years, he is deserving of notice. His family was of Italian origin, and among the early settlers of Virginia. He was born in 1794, in King William county in that State, and when, in 1812, war was declared against Great Britain, with four brothers, he entered the army, and was commissioned as Lieutenant of the Thirty-fifth Infantry. He behaved gallantly at Fort Erie and Sackett's Harbor, and after peace was declared, he was retained as a First Lieuten ant of the Third Infantry. In 1816 he was sta tioned at Fort Dearborn, now the site of Chicago. While on a furlough, he called one day upon President Monroe, who told him that a fort would be built near the Falls of Saint Anthony, and an Indian Agency established, to which he offered to appoint him. His commission was dated March 27th, 1819, and he proceeded in due time to his post. Early in September two more boats and a bat teaux, with officers and one hundred and twenty recruits, arrived. During the winter of 1820, Laidlow and others, in behalf of Lord Selkirk's Scotch settlers at Pembina, whose crops had been destroyed by grasshoppers, passed the Cantonment, on then way to Prairie du Chien, to purchase wheat. Upon the fifteenth of April they began their return with their Mackinaw boats, each loaded with two hundred bushels of wheat, one hundred of oats, and thirty of peas, and reached the mouth of the Minnesota early in May. Ascending this stream to Big Stone Lake, the boats were drawn on rollers a mile and a half to Lake Traverse, and on the third of June arrived at Pembina and cheered the desponding and needy settlers of the Selkirk colony. On the fifth day of May, 1820, Leavenworth left his winter quarters at Mendota, crossed the stream and made a summer camp near the present military grave yard, which in consequence of a fine spring has been called \"Camp Cold Water.\" The Indian agency, under Taliaferro, remained for a time at the old cantonment.

The first distinguished visitors at the new encampment were Governor Lewis Cass, of Michigan, and Henry Schoolcraft, who arrived in July, by way of Lake Superior and Sandy Lake. The relations between Col. Leavenworth and Indian Agent Taliaferro were not entirely har monious, growing out of a disagreement of views relative to the treatment of the Indians, and on the day of the arrival of Governor Cass, Tel iaferro WTites to Leavenworth : The earhest manuscript in Minnesota, written at the Cantonment, is dated October 4, 1820, and is in the handwriting of Colonel Snelling. It reads : \" In justice to Lawrence Taliaferro, Esq., Indian Agent at this post, we, the undersigned, officers of the Fifth Regiment here stationed, have presented him this paper, as a token, not only of our individual respect and esteem, but as an entire approval of his conduct and deportment as a pubhc agent in this quarter.

The Indian Agent, through Cohn Campbell, as interpreter, notified the Sissetons that trade would cease with them, until the murderers were dehvered. At a council held at Big Stone Lake, one of the murderers, and the aged father of another, agreed to surrender themselves to the commanding officer. On the twelfth of November, accompamed by their friends, they approached the encampment in solemn procession, and marched to the centre of the parade. First appeared a Sisseton bear ing a British flag ; then the murderer and the de voted father of another, their arms pinioned, and A few days after this note was written Josiah Snelling, who had been recently promoted to the Colonelcy of the Fifth Regiment, arrived with his family, relieved Leavenworth, and infused new life and energy.

Snelling detained the old chief, while the murderer was sent to St. Louis for trial. In the middle of October, there embarked on the keel-boat \" Saucy Jack,\" for Prairie du Chien, Col. Snelling, Lieut. Baxley, Major Tahaferro, and Mrs. Gooding, EVENTS OF 1822 AND 1823. Early in January, 1822, there came to the Fort from the Red River of the North, Col. Robert Dickson, Laidlow, a Scotch farmer, the superin tendent of Lord Selkirk's experimental farm, and one Mackenzie, on their way to Prairie du Chien. Dickson returned with a drove of cattle, but owing to the hostility of the Sioux his cattle were scattered, and never reached Pembina. EVENTS OF THE YEAR 1821. Col. Snelling built the fort in the shape of a lozenge, in view of the projection between the two rivers. The first row of barracks was of hewn logs, obtained from the pine forests of Rum River, but the other buildings were of stone. Mrs. Van Cleve, the daughter of Lieutenant, afterwards Captain Clark, writes : During the winter of 1823, Agent Tahaferro was in Washington. While returning in March, he was at a hotel in Pittsburg, when he received a note signed G. C. Beltrami, who was an Italian exile, asking permission to accompany him to the Indian territory. He was tall and commanding in appearance, and gentlemanly in bearing, and Taliaferro was so forcibly impressed as to accede to the request. After reaching St. Louis they embarked on the first steamboat for the Upper Mississippi. \" In 1821 the fort, although not complete, was fit for occupancy. My father had assigned to him the quarters next beyond the steps leading to the Commissary's stores, and during the year my little sister Juliet was born there. At a later period my father and Major Garland obtained permission to build more commodious quarters outside the walls, and the result was the two stone houses afterwards occupied by the Indian Agent and interpreter, lately destroyed.\" It wras named the Virginia, and was built in Pittsburg, twenty-two feet in width, and one hundred and eighteen feet in length, in charge of a Captain CrawTford. It reached the Fort on the tenth of May, and was saluted by the discharge of cannon. Among the passengers, besides the Agent and the Italian, were Major Biddle, Lieut. Russell, and others. Early in August, a young and intelligent mixed blood, Alexis Bailly, in after years a member of the legislature of Minnesota, left the cantonment with the first drove of cattle for the Selkirk Set tlement, and the next winter returned with Col. Robert Dickson and Messrs. Laidlow and Mac kenzie. The arrival of the Virginia is an era in the history of the Dahkotah nation, and will proba bly be transmitted to their posterity as long as they exist as a people. They say their sacred men, the night before, dreamed of seeing some monster of the waters, which frightened them very much. The next month, a party of Sissetons visited the Indian Agent, and told him that they had started with another of the murderers, to which reference has been made, but that on the way he had, through fear of being hung, killed himself. As the boat neared the shore, men, women, and children beheld with silent astonishment, supposing that it was some enormous water-spirit, coughing, puffing out hot breath, and splashing water in every direction. When it touched the landing their fears prevailed, and they retreated some distance ; but when the blowing off of steam commenced they were completely un nerved : mothers forgetting their children, with streaming hair, sought hiding-places ; chiefs, re- This fall, a mill was constructed for the use of the garrison, on the west side of St. Anthony Falls,under the supervision of Lieutenant McCabe.

Upon she return of the son in safety he was much gratified at what he considered the prowess of his parent. The peace agreement beteen the Ojibways and Dahkotahs, made through the influence of Gov ernor Cass, was of brief duration, the latter be ing the first to violate the provisions. On the fourth of June, Taliaferro, the Indian agent among the Dahkotahs, took advantage of the presence of a large number of Ojibways to renew the agreement for the cessation of hostili ties. The council hall of the agent was a large room of logs, in which waved conspicuously the flag of the United States, surrounded by British colors and medals that had been delivered up from time to time by Indian chiefs. On the third of July, 1823, Major Long, of the engineers, arrived at the fort in command of an expedition to explore the Minnesota River, and the region along the northern boundary line of the United States. Beltrami, at the request of Col. Snelling, was permitted to be of the party, and Major Taliaferro kindly gave him a horse and equipments. The relations of the Italian to Major Long were not pleasant, and at Pembina Beltrami left the expedition, and with a \" bois brule \", and two Ojibways proceeded and discovered the northern sources of the Mississippi, and suggested where the western sources would be found ; which was verified by Schoolcraft nine years later. About the second week in September Beltrami returned to the fort by way of the Mississippi, escorted by forty or fifty Ojibways, and on the 25th departed for New Orleans, where he published his discov eries in the French language. Among the Dahkotah chiefs present were Wapashaw7, Little Crow, and Penneshaw ; of the Ojibways there were Kendouswa, Moshomene, and Pasheskonoepe. After mutual accusations and excuses concerning the infraction of the pre vious treaty, the Dahkotahs lighted the calumet, they having been the first to infringe upon the agreement of 1820. After smoking and passing the pipe of peace to the Ojibways, who passed through the same formalities, they all shook hands as a pledge of renewed amity. The morning after the council, Flat Mouth, the distinguished Ojibway chief, arrived, who had left his lodge vowing that he would never be at peace with the Dahkotahs. As he stepped from his canoe, Penneshaw held out his hand, but was repulsed with scorn. The Dahkotah warrior immediately gave the alarm, and in a moment runners were on their way to the neighboring villages to raise a war party. The mill which was constructed in 1821, for sawing lumber, at the Falls of St. Anthony, stood upon the site of the Holmes and Sidle Mill, in Minneapolis, and in 1823 was fitted up for grind ing flour. The following extracts from corres pondence addressed to Lieut. Clark, Commissary at Fort Snelling, will be read with interest. Under the date of August 5th, 1823, General Gibson writes : \" From a letter addressed by Col. Snelling to the Quartermaster General, dated the 2d of April, I learn that a large quan tity of wheat would be raised this summer. The assistant Commissary of Subsistence at St. Louis has been instructed to forward sickles and a pair of millstones to St. Peters. If any flour is manu factured from the wheat raised, be pleased to let me know as early as practicable, that I may deduct the quantity manufactured at the post from the quantity advertised to be contracted for.\" On the sixth of June, the Dahkotahs had assem bled, stripped for a fight, and surrounded the Ojibways. The latter, fearing the worst, con cealed their women and children behind the old barracks which had been used by the troops while the fort was being erected. At the solicitation of the agent and commander of the fort, the Dahko tahs desisted from an attack and retired. On the seventh, the Ojibways left for their homes; but, in a few hours, while they were making a portage at Falls of St. Anthony, they were again approached by the Dahkotahs, who would have attacked them, if a detachment of troops had not arrived from the fort.

Scott, on a tour of inspection, and at his sug gestion, its name was changed from Fort St. Anthony to Fort Snelling. The following is an extract from his report to the War Department : Charlotte Ouisconsin Van Cleve, now the oldest person living who was connected with the can- tonment in 1819, in a paper read before the De partment of American History of the Minnesota Historical Society in January, 1880, wrote : \" In 1823, Mrs. Snelling and my mother estab- \" This work, of which the War Department is in possession of a plan, reflects the highest credit on Col.

The cost of erection to the government has been the amount paid for tools and iron, and the per diem paid to soldiers employed as mechanics. I wish to suggest to the General in Chief, and through him to the War Department, the propriety of calling this work Fort Snelling, as a just compliment to the meritorious officer under whom it has been erected.

It was held in the basement of the commanding officer's quarters, and was productive of much good. Many of the soldiers, with their families, attended. Joe. Brown, since so well know in this country, then a drummer boy, was one of the pupils. A Bible class, for the officers and their wives, was formed, and all became so inter ested in the history of the patriarchs, that it fur nished topics of conversation for the week. One day after the Sunday School lesson on the death of Moses, a member of the class meeting my mother on the parade, after exchanging the usual greet ings, said, in saddened tones, ' But don't you feel sorry that Moses is dead ? ' Early in the spring of 1824, the Tully boys were rescued from the Sioux and brought to the fort. They were children of one of the settlers of Lord Selkirk's colony, and with their parents and others, were on their way from Red River In 1824, Major Taliaferro proceeded to Wash ington with a delegation of Chippeways and Dah kotahs, headed by Little Crow, the grand father of the chief of the same name, who was engaged in the late horrible massacre of defenceless women and children. The object of the visit, was to secure a convocation of all the tribes of the Upper Mississippi, at Prairie du Chein, to define their boundary lines and establish friendly rela tions. When they reached Prairie du Chein, Wahnatah, a Yankton chief, and also Wapashaw, by the whisperings of mean traders, became dis- Valley to settle near Fort Snelling. The party was attacked by Indians, and the parents of these children murdered, and the boys captured. Through the influence of Col. Snell ing the children were ransomed and brought to the fort. Col.

Little Crow, perceiving this, stopped all hesitancy by the fol lowing speech: \"My friends, you can do as you please. I am no coward, nor can my ears be pulled about by evil counsels. We are here and should go on, and do some good for our nation. I have taken our Father here (Tahaferro) by the coat tail, and will follow him until I take by the hand, our great American Father.\" Forty years ago, the means of communication between Fort Snelling and the civilized world were very limited. The mail in winter was usu ally carried by soldiers to Prairie du Chien. On the 26th of January, 1826, there was great joy in the fort, caused by the return from furlough of Lieutenants Baxley and Russell, who brought with them the first mail received for five months. About this period there was also another excite ment, cause by the seizure of liquors in the trad\" ing house of Alexis Bailey, at New Hope, now Mendota. While on board of a steamer on the Ohio River, Marcpee or the Cloud, in consequence of a bad dream, jumped from the stern of the boat, and was supposed to be drowned, but he swam ashore and made his way to St. Charles, Mo., there to be murdered by some Sacs. The re mainder safely arrived in Washington and ac complished the object of the visit. The Dahko tahs returned by way of New York, and while there were anxious to pay a visit to certain par ties with Wm. Dickson, a half-breed son of Col Robert Dickson, the trader, who in the war of 1812-15 led the Indians of the Northwest against the United States. During the months of February and March, in this year, snow fell to the depth cf two or three feet, and there was great suffering among the Indians. On one occasion, thirty lodges of Sisse ton and other Sioux were overtaken by a snow storm on a large prairie. The storm continued for three days, and provisions grew scarce, for the party were seventy in number. At last, the stronger men, with the few pairs of snow-shoes in their possession, started for a tradmg post one hundred miles distant. They reached their des tination half alive, and the traders sympathizing sent four Canadians with supplies for those left behind. After great toil they reached the scene of distress, and found many dead, and, what was more horrible, the living feeding on the corpses of their relatives. A mother had eaten her dead child and a portion of her own father's arms. The shock to her nervous system was so great that she lost her reason. Her name was Pash uno-ta, and she was both young and good look ing. One day in September, while at Fort Snell ing, she asked Captain Jouett if he knew which was the best portion of a man to eat, at the same time taking him by the collar of his coat. He rephed with great astonishment, \"No !\" and she then said, \"The arms.\" She then asked for a piece of his servant to eat, as she was nice and fat. A few days after this she dashed herself from the bluffs near Fort Snelling, into the river. Her body was found just above the mouth of the Minnesota, and decently interred by the agent. After this visit Little Crow carried a new double-barreled gun, and said that a medicine man by the name of Peters gave it to him for signing a certain paper, and that he also prom ised he would send a keel-boat full of goods to them. The medicine man referred to was the Rev. Samuel Peters, an Episcopal clergyman, who had made himself obnoxious during the Revolution by his tory sentiments, and was sub sequently nominated as Bishop of Vermont. Peters asserted that in 1806 he had purchased of the heirs of Jonathan Carver the right to a tract of land on the upper Mississippi, embracing St. Paul, alleged to have been given to Carver by the Dahkotahs, in 1767. i The next year there arrived, in one of the keel boats from Prairie du Chien, at Fort Snelhng a box marked Col. Robert Dickson. On opening, it was found to contain a few presents from Peters to Dickson's Indian wife, a long letter, and a copy of Carver's alleged grant, written on parch ment. EVENTS OF THE YEARS 1825 AND 1826. On the 30th of October, 1825, seven Indian women in canoes, were drawn into the rapids above the Falls of St. Anthony: All were saved The spring of 1826 was very backward. On the 20th of March snow fell to the depth of one or one and a half feet on a level, and drifted in"], [111, "NEGRO SLAVES AT FORT SNELLING. 97 heaps from six to fifteen feet in height. On the 5th of April, early in the day, there was a violent storm, and the ice was still thick in the river. During the storm flashes of lightning were seen and thunder heard. On the 10th, the thermome ter was four degrees above zero. On the 14th there was rain, and on the next day the St. Peter river broke up, but the ice on the Mississippi re mained firm. On the 21st, at noon, the ice began to move, and carried away Mr. Faribault's houses on the east side of the river. For several days the river was twenty feet above low water mark, and all the houses on low lands were swept off. On the second of May, the steamboat Lawrence, Captain Reeder, arrived. twenty-two years of age, and had been three years at WTest Point. At a Court Martial convened to try the officer for violating the Articles of War, the accused objected to the testimony of Lieut. Wilham Alexander, a Tennesseean, not a gradu ate of the Military Academy, on the ground that he was an infidel. Alexander, hurt by tliis allu sion, challenged the objector, and another duel was fought, resulting only in slight injuries to the clothing of the combatants. Inspector Gen eral E. P. Gaines, after this, visited the fort, and in his report of the inspection he wrote : \"A defect in the discipline of this regiment has ap neared in the character of certain personal con troversies, between the Colonel and several of his young officers, the particulars of which I forbear to enter into, assured as I am that they will be developed in the proceedings of a general court martial ordered for the trial of Lieutenant Hun ter and other officers at Jefferson Barracks. Major Taliaferro had inherited several slaves, which he used to hire to officers of the garrison. On the 31st of March, his negro boy, Wilham, was employed by Col. Snelling, the latter agree ing to clothe him. About this time, William at tempted to shoot a hawk, but instead shot a small boy, named Henry Cullum, and nearly killed him. In May, Captain Plympton, of the Fifth Infantry, wished to purchase his negro woman, Eliza, but he refused, as it was his intention, ultimately, to free his slaves. Another of his negro girls, Har riet, wras married at the fort, the Major perform ing the ceremony, to the now historic Dred Scott, who was then a slave of Surgeon Emerson. The only person that ever purchased a slave, to retain in slavery, was Alexis Bailly, who bought a man of Major Garland. The Sioux, at first, had no prejudices against negroes. They called them \" Black Frenchmen,\" and placing their hands on their woolly heads would laugh heartily. \" From a conversation with the Colonel I can have no doubt that he has erred in the course pursued by him in reference to some of the con troversies, inasmuch as he has intimated to his officers his willingness to sanction in certain cases, and even to participate in personal conflicts, con trary to the twenty-fifth, Article of War.\" The Colonel's son, William Joseph, after this passed several years among traders and Indians, and became distinguished as a poet and brilliant author. . His \"Tales of the Northwest,\" published in Boston in 1820, by Hilliard, Gray, Little & Wil kins, is a work of great literary ability, and Catlin thought the book was the most faithful picture of Indian hfe he had read. Some of his poems were also of a high order. One of his pieces, deficient in dignity, was a caustic satire upon modern American poets, and was published under the title of \" Truth, a Gift for Scribblers.\" The following is a list of the steamboats that had arrived at Fort Snelling, up to May 26, 1826 : 1 Virginia, May 10, 1823 ; 2 Neville ; 3 Put nam, April 2, 1825 ; 3 Mandan ; 5 Indiana ; 6 Law rence, May 2, 1826; 7 Sciota ; 8 Eclipse; 9 Jo sephine ; 10 Fulton; 11 Red Rover; 12 Black Rover \\ 13 Warrior; 14 Enterprise; 15 Volant. Nathaniel P. Wilhs, who had winced under the last, wrote the following lampoon : \" Oh, smelling Joseph ! Thou art like a cur.

In this ap peared the following pasquinade upon Willis : \"I hve by hunting fur, thou say'st, so let it be, EVENTS OF A. D. 1827. On the twenty-eighth of May, 1827, the Ojib way chief at Sandy Lake, Kee-wee-zais-hish called by the Enghsh, Flat Mouth with seven warriors and some women and children, in all amounting to twenty-four, arrived about sunrise at Fort Snelling. Walking to the gates of the garrison, they asked the protection of Colonel Snelling and Taliaferro, the Indian agent. They were told, that as long as they remained under the United States flag, they wrere secure, and were ordered to encamp within musket shot of the high stone walls of the fort. But tell me, Natty !

The wooden plates emptied of their contents, they engaged in conversation, and whiffed the peace pipe. died in, Nat ! thine apotheosis had been certain.\" Snelling died at Chelsea, Mass., December six teenth, 1848, a victim to the appetite which en enslaved Robert Burns. In the year 1826, a small party of Ojibways (Chippeways) came to see the Indian Agent, and three of them ventured to visit the Colum- bia Fur Company's trading house, two miles from the Fort. While there, they became aware of their danger, and desired two of the white men attached to the establishment to accompany them back, thinking that their pres- ence might be some protection. They were in error. As they passed a little copse, three Dah- kotahs sprang from behind a log with the speed of light, fired their pieces into the face of the fore- most, and then fled. The guns must have been double loaded, for the man's head was literally blown from his shoulders, and his white com- panions were spattered with brains and blood. The survivors gained the Fort without further molestation. Their comrade was buried on the spot where he fell. A staff was set up on his grave, which became a landmark, and received the name of The Murder Pole. The murderers boasted of their achievement and with impunity. They and their tribe thought that they had struck a fair blow on their ancient enemies, in a becom- ing manner. It was only said, that Toopunkah Zeze of the village of the Batture aux Fievres, and two others, had each acquired a right to wear skunk skins on their heels and war-eagles' feathers on their heads. That night, some officers and their friends were spending a pleasant evening at the head-quarters of Captain Clark, which was in one of the stone houses which used to stand outside of the walls of the fort. As Captain Cruger was walking on the porch, a bullet whizzed by, and rapid firing was heard. As the Dahkotahs, or Sioux, left the Ojibway camp, notwithstanding their friendly talk, they turned and discharged their guns with deadly aim upon their entertainers, and ran off with a shout of satisfaction. The report was heard by the sentinel of the fort, and he cried, repeatedly, \" Corporal of the guard !\" and soon at the gates, were the Ojibways, with their women and the wounded, telhng their tale of woe in wild and in coherent language. Two had been killed and six wounded. Among others, was a little girl about seven years old, who was pierced through both thighs with - bullet. Surgeon McMahon made every effort to save her life, but without avail. Flat Mouth, the chief, reminded Colonel Snel ling that he had been attacked while under the protection of the United States flag, and early the next morning, Captain Clark, with one hundred soldierc, proceeded towards Land's End, a tra ding-post of the Columbia Fur Company, on the Minnesota, a mile above the former residence of"], [113, "TRAGIC SCENE UNDER THE WALLS OF THE FORT. 99 Franklin Steele, where the Dahkotahs were sup posed to be. The soldiers had just left the large gate of the fort, when a party of Dahkotahs, in battle array, appeared on one of the prairie hills. After some parleying they turned their backs, and being pursued, thirty-two were cap tured near the trading-post. first, of running for their lives. At the first fire the coward fell a corpse; but his brave compan ion, though wounded, ran on, and had nearly reached the goal of safety, when a second bullet killed him. The body of the coward now became a common object of loathing for both Dahkotahs and Ojibways. Colonel Snelling ordered the prisoners to be brought before the Ojibways, and two being pointed out as participants in the slaughter of the preceding night, they were delivered to the aggrieved party to deal with in accordance with their customs. They were led out to the plain in front of the gate of the fort, and when placed nearly without the range of the Ojibway guns, they were told to run for their lives. With the rapidity of deer they bounded away, but the Ojib way bullet slew faster, and after a few steps, they fell gasping on the ground, and were soon lifeless. Then the savage nature displayed itself in all its hideousness. Women and children danced for joy, and placing their fingers in the bullet holes, from which the blood oozed, they licked them with delight. The men tore the scalps from the dead, and seemed to luxuriate in the privilege of plunging their knives through the corpses. After the execution, the Ojibways returned to the fort, and were met by the Colonel. He had prevented all over whom his authority extended from wit nessing the scene, and had done his best to con fine the excitement to the Indians. The same day a deputation of Dahkotah warriors received audience, regretting the violence that had been done by their young men, and agreeing to deliver up the ringleaders. Colonel Snelling told the Ojibways that the bodies must be removed, and then they took the scalped Dahkotahs, and dragging them by the heels, threw them off the bluff into the river, a hundred and fifty feet beneath. The dreadful scene was now over ; and a detachment of troops was sent with the old chief Flat Mouth, to escort him out of the reach of Dahkotah vengeance. An eyewitness wrote : \" After this catastrophe, all the Dahkotahs quitted the vicinity of Fort Snel ling, and did not return to it for some months. It was said that they formed a conspiracy to de mand a council, and kill the Indian Agent and the commanding officer. If this was a fact, they had no opportunity, or wanted the spirit, to exe cute their purpose. \" The Flat Mouth's band lingered in the fort till their wounded comrade died. He was sensi ble of his condition, and bore his pains with great fortitude. When he felt his end approach, he desired that his horse might be gaily caparisoned, and brought to the hospital window, so that he might touch the animal. He then took from his medicine bag a large cake of maple sugar, and held it forth. It may seem strange, but it is true, that the beast ate it from his hand. His features were radiant with delight as he fell back on the pillow exhausted. His horse had eaten the sugar, he said, and he was sure of a favorable reception and comfortable quarters in the other world. Half an hour after, he breathed his last. We tried to discover the details of his superstition, but could not succeed. It is a subject on which Indians unwillingly discourse.\" At the time appointed, a son of Flat Mouth, with those of the Ojibwa party that were not wounded, escorted by United States troops, marched forth to meet the Dahkotah deputation, on the prairie just beyond the old residence of the Indian agent. With much solemnity two more of the guilty were handed over to the assaulted. One was fearless, and with firmness stripped himself of his clothing and ornaments, and distributed them. The other could not face death with composure. He was noted for a hid eous hare-lip, and had a bad reputation among his fellows. In the spirit of a coward he prayed for life, to the mortification of his tribe. The same opportunity was presented to them as to the In the fall of 1826, all the troops at Prairie du Chien had been removed to Fort Snelling, the commander taking with him two Wimiebagoes that had been confined in Fort Crawford. After the soldiers left the Prairie, the Indians in the vicinity were quite insolent. In June, 1827, two keel-boats passed Prairie du Chien on the way to Fort Snelling with provis ions. When they reached Wapashaw village, on"], [114, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA.. 100 keel -boat appeared, and among her passengers was Joseph Snelling, the talented son of the colonel, who wrote a story of deep interest, based on the facts narrated. the site of the present town of Winona, the crew were ordered to come ashore by the Dahkotahs. Complying, they found themselves surrounded by Indians with hostile intentions. The boatmen had no fire-arms, but assuming a bold mien and a defiant voice, the captain of the keel-boats ordered the savages to leave the decks ; which was suc cessful, The boats pushed on, and at Red Wing and Kaposia the Indians showed that they were not friendly, though they did not molest the boats. Before they started on their return from Fort Snelling, the men on board, amounting to thirty-two, were all provided with muskets and a barrel of ball cartridges. At a meeting of the citizens it was resolved to repair old Fort Crawford, and Thomas McNair was appointed captain. Dirt was thrown around the bottom logs of the fortification to prevent its being fired, and young Snelling was put in com mand of one of the block-houses. On the next day a voyageur named Loyer, and the well-known trader Duncan Graham, started through the in terior, west of the Mississippi, with intelligence of the murders, to Fort Snelling. Intelligence of this attack was received at the fort, on the evening of the ninth of July, and Col. Snelling started in keel boats with four companies to Fort Crawford, and on the seventeenth four more companies left under Major Fowle. After an absence of six weeks, the soldiers, without firing a gun at the enemy, returned. When the descending keel-boats passed Wapa shaw, the Dahkotas were engaged in the war dance, and menaced them, but made no attack. Below this point one of the boats moved in ad vance of the other, and when near the mouth of the Bad Axe, the half-breeds on board descried hostile Indians on the banks. As the channel neared the shore, the sixteen men on the first boat were greeted with the war whoop and a vol ley of rifle balls from the excited Winnebagoes, killing two of the crew. Rushing into their ca noes, the Indians made the attempt to board the boat, and two were successful. One of these stationed himself at the bow of the boat, and fired with killing effect on the men below deck. An old soldier of the last war with Great Britain, called Saucy Jack, at last despatched him, and began to rally the fainting spirits on board. Du ring the fight the boat had stuck on a sand-bar. With four companions, amid a shower of balls from the savages, he plunged into the water and pushed off the boat, and thus moved out of reach of the galling shots of the Winnebagoes. As they floated down the river during the night, they heard a wail in a canoe behind them, the voice of a father mourning the death of the son who had scaled the deck, and was now a corpse in possession of the white men. The rear boat passed the Bad Axe river late in the night, and escaped an attack. A few weeks after the attack upon the keel boats General Gaines inspected the Fort, and, subsequently in a communication to the War Department wrote as follows ; \" The main points of defence against an enemy appear to have been in some respects sacrificed, in the effort to secure the comfort and conven ience of troops in peace. These are important considerations, but on an exposed frontier the primary object ought to be security against the attack of an enemy. \" The buildings are too laige, too numerous, and extending over a space entirely too great, enclosing a large parade, five times greater than is at all desireable in that climate. The build ings for the most part seem well constructed, of good stone and other materials, and they contain every desirable convenience, comfort and securi ty as barracks and store houses. \" The work may be rendered very strong and adapted to a garrison of two hundred men by re moving one-half the buildings, and with the ma terials of which they are constructed, building a tower sufficiently high to command the hill be tween the Mississippi and St. Peter's [Minnesota], and by a block house on the extreme point, or brow of the cliff , near the commandant's quarters, to secure most effectually the banks of the river, and the boats at the landing. The first keel-boat arrived at Prairie du Chein, with two of their crew dead, four wounded, and the Indian that had been killed on the boat. The two dead men had been residents of the Prairie, and now the panic was increased. On the morn ing of the twenty-eighth of June the second"], [115, "DEATH OF COL.

The excitement was intense among the Sioux, and immediately war parties started in pursuit. Hole-in-the-Day 's band was not sought, but the Mille Lacs and Saint Croix Chippeways. The Lake Calhoun Sioux, with those from the villages on the Minnesota, assembled at the Falls of Saint Anthony, and on the morning of the fourth of July, came up with the Mille Lacs Chippeways on Rum River, before sunrise. Not long after the war whoop was raised and the Sioux attacked, killing and wounding ninety. On the second of August old Hole-in-the-Day, and some Ojibways, came to the fort. They stopped first at the cabin of Peter Quinn, whose wife was a half-breed Chippeway, abort a mile from the fort. The Kaposia band of Sioux pursued the Saint Croix Chippeways, and on the third of July found them in the Penitentiary ravine at Stillwater, under the influence of whisky. Aitkin, the old trader, was with them. The sight of the Sioux tended to make them sober, but in the fight twenty-one were killed and twenty-nine were wounded. The missionary, Samuel W. Pond, told the agent that the Sioux, of Lake Calhoun were aroused, and on their way to attack the Chippe ways. The agent quieted them for a time, but two of the relatives of those slain at Lac qui Parle in April, hid themselves near Quinn's house, and as Hole-in-the-Day and his associates were pass ing, they fired and killed one Chippeway and wounded another. Obequette, a Chippeway from Red Lake, succeded, however, in shooting a Sioux while he was in the act of scalping his comrade. The Chippeways were brought within the fort as soon as possible, and at nine o'clock a Sioux was confined in the guard-house as a hostage. Whisky, during the year 1839, was freely in troduced, in the face of the law prohibiting it. The first boat of the season, the Ariel, came to the fort on the fourteenth of April, and brought twenty barrels of whisky for Joseph II. Brown, and on the twenty-first of May, the Glaucus brought six barrels of liquor for David Faribault. On the thirtieth of June, some soldiers went to Joseph R. Brown's groggery on the opposite side of the Mississippi, and that night forty - seven were in the guard-house for drunkenness. The demoralization then existing, led to a letter by Surgeon Emerson on duty at the fort, to the Sur geon General of the United States army, in which he writes : Notwithstanding the murdered Chippeway had been buried in the graveyard of the fort for safety, an attempt was made on the part of some of the Sioux, to dig it up. On the evening of the sixth, Major Plympton sent the Chippeways across the river to the east side, and ordered them to go home as soon as possible. \" The whisky is brought here by citizens who are pouring in upon us and settling themselves on the opposite shore of the Mississippi river, in defiance of our worthy commanding officer, Major J. Plympton, whose authority they set at naught. At this moment there is a citizen named Brown, once a soldier in the Fifth Infantry, who was discharged at this post, while Colonel Snelling commanded, and who has been since employed by the Ameri can Fur Company, actually building on the land marked out by the land officers as the reserve, and within gunshot distance of the fort, a very expensive whisky shop.\" EVENTS OF A. D. 1839. On the twentieth day of June the elder Hole in-the-Day arrived from the Upper Mississippi with several hundred Chippeways. Upon their return homeward the Mississippi and Mille Lacs band encamped the first night at the Falls of Saint Anthony, and some of the Sioux visited them and smoked the pipe of peace. On the second of July, about sunrise, a son-in law of the chief of the Sioux band, at Lake Cal houn, named Meekaw or Badger, was killed and scalped by two Chippeways of the Pillager band, relatives of him who lost his life near Patrick"], [118, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 104 CHAPTER XVIII.

Sioni or Dahkotah people-Meaning of words Sioux and Dahkotah-Early villages \u2014 Residence of Sioui in 184\u00bb-The Winnehagoes-The Ojihways or Chippeways. The French traders, to avoid exciting the atten tion of Indians, while conversing in their pres ence, were accustomed to designate them by names, which would not be recognized. The three Indian nations who dwelt in this region after the organization of Minnesota, were the Sioux or Dahkotahs ; the Ojibways or Chip peways ; and the Ho-tchun-graws or Winneba goes. The Dahkotahs were nicknamed Sioux, a word composed of the two last syllables of the Ojibway word for foes SIOUX OR DAHKOTAHS. They are an entirely different group from the Algonquin and Iroquois, who were found by the early settlers of the Atlantic States, on the banks of the Connecticut, Mohawk, and Susquehanna Rivers. Under the influence of the French traders, the eastern Sioux began to wander from the Mille Lacs region. A trading post at O-ton-we-kpa dan, or Rice Creek, above the Falls of Saint Anthony, induced some to erect their summer dwellings and plant corn there, which took the place of wild rice. Those who dwelt here were called Wa-kpa-a-ton-we-dan Those who dwell on the creek. Another division was known as the Ma-tan-ton- wan. When the Dahkotahs were first noticed by the European adventurers, large numbers were occu pying the Mille Lacs region of country, and appro priately called by the voyageur, \"People of the Lake,\" \"Gens duLac.\" And tradition asserts that here was the ancient centre of this tribe. Though we have traces of their warring and hunting on the shores of Lake Superior, there is no satisfactory evidence of their residence, east of the Mille Lacs region, as they have no name for Lake Superior. Less than a hundred years ago, it is said that the eastern Sioux, pressed by the Chippeways, and influenced by traders, moved seven miles above Fort Snelling on the Minnesota River. MED-DAY-WAII-KAWN-TWAWNS. The word Dahkotah, by which they love to be designated, signifies allied or joined together in friendly compact, and is equivalent to \" E pluri bus unum,\" the motto on the seal of the United States. In 1849 there were seven villages of Med-day wah-kawn-twawn Sioux. (1) Below Lake Pepin, where the city of Winona is, was the village of Wapashaw. This band was called Kee-yu-ksa, because with them blood relations intermarried. Bounding or Whipping Wind was the chief. (2) At the head of Lake Pepin, under a lofty bluff, was the Red Wing village, called Ghay-mni-chan Hill, wood and water. Shooter was the name of the chief. (3) Opposite, and a little below the Pig's Eye Marsh, was the Kaposia band. The word, Kapoja means light, given because these people are quick travelers. His Scarlet People, better known as Little Crow, was the chief, and isnotorious as the leader in the massacre of 1862. In the history of the mission at La Pointe, Wisconsin, published nearly two centuries ago, a a writer, referring to the Dahkotahs, remarks : \" For sixty leagues from the extremity of the Upper Lake, toward sunset; and, as it were in the centre of the western nations, they have all united their force by a general league.\" The Dahkotahs in the earliest documents, and even until the present day, are called Sioux, Scioux, or Soos. The name originated with the early voy ageurs.

By the treaty of 1837 they were removed to Iowa, and by another treaty in October, 1846, they came to Minnesota in the spring of 1848, to the country between the Long Prairie, and Crow Wing Rivers. The agency was located on Long Prairie River, forty miles from the Mississippi, and in 1849 the tribe numbered about twenty-five hundred souls. West of this division of the Sioux were\u2014 In February 1855, another treaty was made with them, and that spring they removed to lands on the Blue Earth River. Owing to the panic caused by the outbreak of the Sioux in 1862, Con gress, by a special act, without consulting them, in 1863, removed them from their fields in Min nesota to the Missouri River, and in the words of a missionary, \"they were, like the Sioux, dumped in the desert, one hundred miles above Fort Randall\" W AR-P A Y-KU-T A Y.

North and west of the last were the War-pay twawns, or People of the Leaf, and their princi pal village was Lac qui Parle. They numbered about fifteen hundred. OJIBWAY OR CHIPPEWAY NATION. The Ojibways or Leapers, when the French came to Lake Superior, had their chief settlement at Sault St. Marie, and were called by the French Saulteurs, and by the Sioux, Hah-ha-tonwan, Dwellers at the Falls or Leaping Waters. SE-SEE-TWAWNS. To the west and southwest of these bands of Sioux were the Se-see-twawns (Sissetoans), or Swamp Dwellers. This band claimed the land west of the Blue Earth to the James River, and the guardianship of the Sacred Red Pipestone Quarry. Their principal village was at Traverse, and the number of the band was estimated at thirty-eight hundred. When Du Luth erected his trading post at the western extremity of Lake Superior, they had not obtained any foothold in Minnesota, and were constantly at war with their hereditary enemes, the Nadouaysioux. By the middle of the eighteenth century, they had pushed in and occu pied Sandy, Leech, Mille Lacs and other points between Lake Superior and the Mississippi, which had been dwelling places of the Sioux. In 1S20 the principal villages of Ojibways in Minnesota were at Fond du Lac, Leech Lake and Sandy Lake. In 1837 they ceded most of their lands. Since then, other treaties have been made, until in the year 1881, they are confined to a few res ervations, in northern Minnesota and vicinity. HO-TCHUN-GRAWS, OR WINNEBAGOES.

In 1823 he had estab lished a large boarding school composed of children of various tribes, and here some were educated who became wives of men of intelli gence and influence at the capital of Minnesota.

Bancroft the distinguished historian, catching the enthusiasm of the narratives of the early Jesuits, depicts, in language which glows, their missions to the Northwest ; yet it is erroneous to suppose that the Jesuits exercised any perma nent influence on the Aborigines. Shea, a devoted member of the Roman Catho lic Church, in his History of American Catholic Missions writes : \" In 1680 Father Engalran was apparently alone at Green Bay, and Pierson at Mackinaw. Of the other missions neither Le- Clerq nor Ilennepin, the Recollect writers of the West at this time, make any mention, or in any way allude to their existence.\" He also says that \"Father Menard had projected a Sioux mission ; Marquette, Allouez, Druilletes, all en tertained hopes of realizing it, and had some intercourse with that nation, but none of them ever succeeded in establishing a mission.\" In pursuance of this policy, the Rev. Alvan Coe, and J. D. Stevens, then a licentiate who had been engaged in the Mackinaw Mission, made a tour of exploration, and arrived on September 1, 1829, at Fort Snelling. In the journal of Major Lawrence Taliaferro, which is in possession of the Minnesota Historical Society, is the following entry : \" The Rev. Mr. Coe and Stevens reported to be on their way to this post, members of the Presbyterian church looking out for suitable places to make mission ary establishment for the Sioux and Chippeways, found schools, and instruct in the arts and agri culture.\" Father Hennepin wrote: \" Can it be possible, that, that pretended prodigious amount of savage converts could escape the sight of a multitude of French Canadians who travel every year ? * * * How comes it to pass that these churches so devout and so numerous, should be invisible, when I passed through so many countries and nations ? \" The agent, although not at that time a commu nicant of the Church, welcomed these visitors, and afforded them every facility in visiting the Indians. On Sunday, the 6th of September, the Rev. Mr. Coe preached twice in the fort, and the next night held a prayer meeting at the quarters of the commanding officer. On the next Sunday he preached again, and on the 14th, with Mr. Stevens and a hired guide, returned to Mackinaw by way of the St. Croix river. During this visit the agent offered for a Presbyterian mi-ssion the mill which then stood on the site of Minneapolis, and had been erected by the government, as well as After the American Fur Company was formed, the island of Mackinaw became the residence of the principal agent for the Northwest, Robert Stuart a Scotchman, and devoted Presbyterian.

Wlnle there a steamboat arrived, and among the passengers were two young men, brothers, natives of Washington, Connecticut, Samuel W. and Gideon H. Pond, who had come, constrained by the love of Christ, and without con ferring with flesh and blood, to try to improve the Sioux. CHIPPEWAY MISSIONS. In 1830, F. Ayer, one of the teachers at Mack inaw, made an exploration as far as La Pointe, and returned. Upon the 30th day of August, 1831, a Macki naw boat about forty feet long arrived at La Pointe, bringing from Mackinaw the principal trader, Mr. Warren, Rev. Sherman Hall and wife, and Mr. Frederick Ayer, a catechist and teacher. Samuel, the older brother, the year before, had talked with a liquor seller in Galena, Illinois, who had come from the Red River country, and the desire was awakened to help the Sioux ; and he wrote to his brother to go with him. Mrs. Hall- attracted great attention, as she was the first white woman who had visited that region. Sherman Hall was born on April 30, 1801, at Wethersfield, Vermont, and in 1828 graduated at Dartmouth College, and completed his theological studies at Andover, Massachu setts, a few weeks before he journeyed to the Indian country. The Rev. Samuel W. Pond still lives at Shako pee, in the old mission house, the first building of sawed lumber erected in the valley of the Minne sota, above Fort Snelling. MISSIONS AMONG THE SIOUX A. D. 1835. About this period, a native of South Carolina, a graduate of Jefferson College, Pennsylvania, the Rev. T. S. Williamson, M. D., who previous to his ordination had been a respectable physi cian in Ohio, was appointed by the American Board of Foreign Missions to visit the Dahkotahs with the view of ascertaining what could be done to introduce Christian instruction. Having made inquiries at Prairie du Chien and Fort Snelling, he reported the field was favorable. His classmate at Dartmouth and Andover, the Rev W. T. Boutwell still living near Stillwater, became his yoke-fellow, but remained for a time at Mackinaw, which they reached about the mid dle of July. In June, 1832, Henry R. School craft, the head of an exploring expedition, invited Mr. Boutwell to accompany him to the sources of the Mississippi. When the expedition reached Lac la Biche or Elk Lake, on July 13, 1832, Mr. Schoolcraft, who was not a Latin scholar, asked the Latin word for truth, and was told \"veritas.\" He then wanted the word which signified head, and was told \"caput.\" To the astonishment of many, School craft struck off the first sylable, of the word ver-i-tas and the last sylable of ca-put, and thus coined the word Itasca, which he gave to the lake, and which some modern writers, with all gravity, tell us was the name of a maiden who once dwelt on its banks. Upon Mr. Boutwell's return from this expedition he was at first asso ciated with Mr. Hall in the mission at La Pointe. The Presbyterian and Congregational Churches, through their joint Missionary Society, appointed the following persons to labor in Minnesota : Rev. Thomas S. Williamson, M. D., missionary and physician ; Rev. J. D. Stevens, missionary ; Alexander Huggins, farmer ; and their -wives ; Miss Sarah Poage, and Lucy Stevens, teachers; who were prevented during the year 1834, by the state of navigation, from entering upon their work. During the winter of 1834-35, a pious officer of the army exercised a good influence on his fellow officers and soldiers under his command. In the absence of a chaplain of ordained minis ter, he, like General Havelock, of the British army in India, was accustomed not only to drill the soldiers, but to meet them in bis own quar ters, and reason with them \"of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.\" In 1833 the mission band which had centered at La Pointe diffused their influence. In Octo ber Rev. Mr. Boutwell went to Leech Lake, Mr. Ayer opened a school at Yellow Lake, Wiscon sin, and Mr. E. F. Ely, now in California, became a teacher at Aitkin's trading post at Sandy Lake.

One of the number (a woman) was informed that a brother of hers had died during her absence. He was not at this village, but with another band, and the information had just reached here. In the evening they set up a most piteous crying, or rather wailing, which con tinued, with some little cessations, during the night. The sister of the deceased brother would repeat, times without number, words which may be thus translated into English: 'Come, my brother, I shall see you no more for ever.' The night was extremely cold, the thermometer standing from ten to twenty below zero. About sunrise, next morning, preparation was made for performing the ceremony of cutting their flesh, in order to give relief to their grief of mind. The snow was removed from the frozen ground over about as large a space as would be required to place a small Indian lodge or wigwam. In the centre a very small fire was kindled up, not to give warmth, apparently, but to cause a smoke. The sister of the deceased, who was the chief mourner, came out of her lodge followed by three other women, who repaired to the place prepared. They were all barefooted, and nearly naked. Here they set up a most bitter lamenta tion and crying, mingling their wailings with the words before mentioned. The principal mourner commenced gashing or cutting her ankles and legs up to the knees with a sharp stone, until her legs were covered with gore and flowing blood ; then in like manner her arms, shoulders, and breast. The others cut themselves in the same way, but not so severely. On this poor infatuated woman I presume there were more than a hun dred long deep gashes in the flesh. I saw the operation, and the blood instantly followed the instrument, and flowed down upon the flesh. She appeared frantic with grief. Through the pain of her wounds, the loss of blood, exhaustion of strength by fasting, loud and long-continued and bitter groans, or the extreme cold upon her al most naked and lacerated body, she soon sunk upon the frozen ground, shaking as with a violent fit of the ague, and writhing in apparent agony. ' Surely,' I exclaimed, as I beheld the bloody On the twenty-seventh of this month the Rev. Dr. Williamson united in marriage at the Fort Lieutenant Edward A. Ogden to Eliza Edna, the daughter of Captain G. A. Loomis, the first marriage service in which a clergyman officiated in the present State of Minnesota. On the eleventh of June\" a meeting was held at the Fort to organize a Presbyterian Church, sixteen persons who had been communicants, and six who made a profession of faith, one of whom was Lieutenant Ogden, were enrolled as members. Four elders were elected, among whom were Capt. Gustavus Loomis and Samuel W. Pond. The next day a lecture preparatory to administer ing the communion, was delivered, and on Sun day, the 14th, the first organized church in the Valley of the Upper Mississippi assembled for the first time in one of the Company rooms of the Fort. The services in the morning were conducted by Dr. Williamson. The afternoon service com menced at 2 o'clock. The sermon of Mr. Stevens was upon a most appropriate text, 1st Peter, ii:25 ; \" For ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.\" After the discourse, the sacrament of the Lord's supper was administered. At a meeting of the Sessiop on the thirty-first of July, Rev. J. D. Stevens, missionary, was in vited to preach to the church, \" so long as the duties of his mission will permit, and also to pre side at all the meetings of the Session.\" Captain Gustavus Loomis was elected Stated Clerk of the Session, and they resolved to observe the monthly concert of prayer on the first Monday of each month, for the conversion of the world. Two points were selected by the missionaries as proper spheres of labor. Mr. Stevens and family proceeded to Lake Harriet, and Dr. Wil liamson and family, in June, proceeded to Lac qui Parle. As there had never been a chaplain at Fort Snelling, the Rev. J. D. Stevens, the missionary at Lake Harriet, preached on Sundays to the Presbyterian church, there, recently organized."], [123, "A ROMAN CATHOLIC .MISSIONARY. 109 scene, 'the tender mercies of the heathen are cruelty!' Bishop Loras, of Dubuque, wrote the next year of his visit as follows : \" Our young missionary, M. Ravoux, passed the winter on the banks of Lac-qui-Parle, without any other support than Providence, without any other means of conver sion than a burning zeal, he has wrought in the space of six months, a happy revolution among the Sioux. From the time of his arrival he has been occupied night and day in the study of their language. ***** 'When he instructs the savages, he speaks to them with so much fire whilst showing them a large copper crucifix which he carries on his breast, that he makes the strong est impression upon them.\" \" The little church at the fort begins to mani fest something of a missionary spirit Their con tributions are considerable for so small a number. I hope they will not only be willing to contribute liberally of their substance, but will give them selves, at least some of them, to the missionary work. \" The surgeon of the military post, Dr. Jarvis, has been very assiduous in his attentions to us in our sickness, and has very generously made a do nation to our board of twenty-five dollars, being the amount of his medical services in our family. \" On the nineteenth instant we commenced a school with six full Indian children, at least so in all their habits, dress, etc.; not one could speak a word of any language but Sioux. The school has since increased to the number of twenty-five. I am now collecting and arranging words for a dic tionary. Mr. Pond is assiduously employed in preparing a small spelling-book, which we may forward next mail for printing. The impression, however was evanescent, and he soon retired from the field, and no more efforts were made in this direction by the Church of Rome. This young Mr. Ravoux is now the highly respected vicar of the Roman Catholic diocese of Minnesota, and justly esteemed for his simplicity and unobtrusiveness. CHIPPEWAY MISSIONS AT POKEGUMA. On the fifteenth of September, 1836, a Presby terian church was organized at Lac-qui-Parle, a branch of that in and near Fort Snelling, and Joseph Renville, a mixed blood of great influ ence, became a communicant. He had been trained in Canada by a Roman Catholic priest, but claimed the right of private judgment. Mr. Renville's wife was the first pure Dahkotah of whom we have any record that ever joined the Church of Christ. This church has never become extinct, although its members have been neces sarily nomadic. After the treaty of Traverse des Sioux, it was removed to Hazlewood. Driven from thence by the outbreak of 1862, it has be came the parent of other churches, in the valley of the upper Missouri, over one of which John Renville, a descendant of the elder at Lac-qui- Parle, is the pastor. Pokeguma is one of the \"Mille Lacs,\" or thou sand beautiful lakes for which Minnesota is re markable. It is about four or five miles in extent , and a mile or more in width. This lake is situated on Snake River, about twenty miles above the junction of that stream with the St. Croix. In the year 1836, missionaries came to reside among the Ojibways and Pokeguma, to promote their temporal and spiritual welfare. Their mis sion house was built on the east side of the lake ; but the Indian village was on an island not far from the shore. In a letter written in 1837, we find the fol lowing: \"The young women and girls now make, mend, wash, and iron after our man ner. The men have learned to build log houses, drive team, plough, hoe, and handle an American axe with some skill in cutting large trees, the size of which, two years ago, would have afforded them a sufficient reason why they should not med dle with them.\" ROMAN CATHOLIC MISSION ATTEMPTED. Father Ravoux, recently from France, a sin cere and earnest priest of the Church of Rome, came to Mendota in the autumn of 1841, and after a brief sojourn with the Rev. L. Galtier, who had erected Saint Paul's chapel, which has given the name of Saint Paul to the capital of Minnesota, he ascended the Minnesota River( and visited Lac-qui-Parle. In May, 1841, Jeremiah Russell, who was In dian farmer, sent two Chippeways, accompanied by Elam Greeley, of Stillwater, to the Falls of Saint Croix for supplies. On Saturday, the fifteenth of the month they arrived there, and"], [124, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 110 was shallow, returned the fire, and ran into the woods, escaping without material injury. the next day a steamboat came up with the goods. The captain said a war party of Sioux, headed by Little Crow, was advancing, and the two Chippeways prepared to go back and were their friends. The little girls, in their fright, waded into the lake; but were pursued. Their parents upon the island, heard the death cries of their children. Some of the Indians around the mission-house jumped into their canoes and gained the island. Others went into some fortified log huts. The attack upon the canoe, it was afterwards learned, was premature. The party upon that side of the lake were ordered not to fire, until the party stationed in the woods near the mission began. They had hardly left the Falls, on their re turn, before they saw a party of Dahkotahs. The sentinel of the enemy had not noticed the ap proach of the young men. In the twinkling of an eye, these two young Ojibways raised their guns, fired, and killed two of Little Crow's sons. The discharge of the guns revealed to a sentinel, that an enemy was near, and as the Ojibways were retreating, he fired, and mortally wounded one of the two. There were in all one hundred and eleven Dahkotah warriors, and all the fight was in the vicinity of the mission-house, and the Ojibways mostly engaged in it were those who had been under religious instruction. The rest were upon the island. According to custom, the corpses of the chief's sons were dressed, and then set up with their faces towards the country of their ancient ene mies. The wounded Ojibway was horribly mangled by the infuriated party, and his limbs strewn about in every direction. His scalped head was placed in a kettle, and suspended in front of the two Dahkotah corpses. The fathers of the murdered girls, burning for revenge, left the island in a canoe, and drawing it up on the shore, hid behind it, and fired upon the Dahkotahs and killed one. The Dahkotahs advancing upon them, they were obliged to escape. The canoe was now launched. One lay on his back in the bottom ; the other plunged into the water, and, holding the canoe with one hand, and swimming with the other, he towed his friend out of danger. The Dahkotahs, in furiated at their escape, fired volley after volley at the swimmer, but he escaped the balls by putting his head under water whenever he saw them take aim, and waiting till he heard the discharge, he would then look up and breathe. Little Crow, disheartened by the loss of his two boys, returned with his party to Kaposia. But other parties were in the field. It was not till Friday, the twenty-first of May, that the death of one of the young Ojibways sent by Mr. Russell, to the Falls of Saint Croix, was knowTi at Pokeguma. Mr. Russell on the next Sunday, accompanied by Captain William Holcomb and a half-breed, went to the mission station to attend a religious service, and while crossing the lake in returning, the half-breed said that it was rumored that the Sioux were approaching. On Monday, the twen ty-fourth, three young men left in a canoe to go to the west shore of the lake, and from thence to Mille Lacs, to give intelligence to the Ojibways there, of the skirmish that had already occurred. They took with them two Indian girls, about twelve years of age, who were pupils of the mis sion school, for the purpose of bringing the canoe back to the island. Just as the three were land ing, twenty or thirty Dahkotah warriors, with a war whoop emerged from their concealment be hind the trees, and fired into the canoe. The young men instantly sprang into the water, which After a fight of two hours, the Dahkotahs re treated, with a loss of two men. At the request of the parents, Mr. E. F. Ely, from whose notes the writer has obtained these facts, be ing at that time a teacher at the mission, went across the lake, with two of his friends, to gather the remains of his murdered pupils. He found the corpses on the shore. The heads cut off and scalped, with a tomahawk buried in the brains of each, were set up in the sand near the bodies. The bodies were pierced in the breast, and the right arm of one was taken away. Re moving the tomahawks, the bodies were brought back to the island, and in the afternoon were buried in accordance with the simple but solemn rites of the Church of Christ, by members of the mission."], [125, "SIOUX MISSIONARIES BEFORE THE TREATIES. 111 The sequel to this story is soon told.

It contained then about 5500 words, not including the various forms of the verbs. Since that time, the words collected by Dr. Williamson and myself, have, I presume, increased the num ber to six thousand. ***** in this con nection, I may mention that during the winter of 1839-40, Mrs. Riggs, with some assistance, wrote an English and Sioux vocabulary containing about three thousand words. One ot Mr. Ren ville's sons and three of his daughters are en gaged in copying. In committing the grammati cal principles of the language to writing, we have done something at this station, but more has been done by Mr. S. W. Pond.\" In July of the following year, 1842, a war party was formed at Fond du Lac, about forty in num ber, and proceeded towards the Dahkotah country. Sneaking, as none but Indians can, they arrived unnoticed at the little settlement below Saint Paul, commonly called \"Pig's Eye,\" which is opposite to what was Kaposia, or Little Crow's village. Finding an Indian woman at work in the garden of her husband, a Canadian, by the name of Gamelle, they killed her ; also another woman, with her infant, whose head was cut off. The Dahkotahs, on the opposite side, were mostly intoxicated ; and, flying across in their canoes but half prepared, they were worsted in the en counter. They lost thirteen warriors, and one of their number, known as the Dancer, the Ojib ways are said to have skinned. Steadily the number of Indian missionaries increased, and in 1851, before the lands of the Dahkotahs west of the Mississippi were ceded to the whites, they were disposed as follows by the Dahkotah Presbytery.

Soon after this the Chippeway missions of the St. Croix Valley were abandoned. In a little while Rev. Mr. Boutwell removed to the vicinity of Stillwater, and the missionaries, Ayer and Spencer, went to Red Lake and other points in Minnesota. Traverse des Sioux, Rev. Robert Hopkins, Mis sionary; Mrs. Agnes Hopkins, Alexander G. Huggins, Mrs. Lydia P. Hoggins, Assistants. Shakpay, or Shokpay, Rev. Samuel W. Pond, Missionary; Mrs. Sarah P. Pond, Assistant.

Branson commenced a Methodist mission at Kaposia, about four miles below, and opposite Saint Paul. It was afterwards removed across the river to Red Rock. He was assisted by the Rev. Thomas W. Pope, and the latter was succeeded by the Rev. J. Holton. Red Wing, Rev. John F. Aiton, Rev. Joseph W. Hancock, Missionaries; Mrs. Nancy H. Aiton, Mrs. Hancock, Assistants. The Rev. Daniel Gavin, the Swiss Presbyte rian Missionary, spent the winter of 1839 in Lac qui-Parle and was afterwards married to a niece of the Rev. J. D. Stevens, of the Lake Harriet Mission. Mr. Stevens became the farmer and teacher of the Wapashaw band, and the first white man who lived where the city of Winona has been built. Another missionary from Switz erland, the Rev. Mr. Denton, married a Miss Skinner, formerly of the Mackinaw mission. During a portion of the year 1839 these Swiss missionaries lived with the American mission aries at camp Cold Water near Fort Snelling, but their chief field of labor was at Red Wing. The Rev. Mr. Spates and others also labored for a brief period among the Ojibways. PRESBYTERIAN MISSIONS CONTINUED. At the stations the Dahkotah language was dil igently studied. Rev. S. W. Pond had prepared a dictionary of three thousand words, and also a small grammar. The Rev. S. R. Riggs, who joined the mission in 1837, in a letter dated February 24, 1841, writes: \"Last summer, after returning from Fort Snelling, I spent five weeks in copying again the Sioux vocabulary which we had collected and arranged at this sta-"], [126, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA.. 112 CHAPTER XX.

The Saint Croix river, according to Le Sueur, named after a Frenchman who was drowned at its mouth, was one of the earliest throughfares from Lake Superior to the Mississippi. The first white man who directed canoes upon its waters was Du Luth, who had in 1679 explored Minne sota. He thus describes his tour in a letter, first published by Harrisse : \"In June, 1680, not be ing satisfied, with having made my discovery by land, I took two canoes, writh an Indian who was my interpreter, and four Frenchmen, to seek means to make it by water. With this view I entered a river which empties eight leagues from the extremity of Lake Superior, on the south side, where, after having cut some trees and broken about a hundred beaver dams, I reached the upper waters of the said river, end then I made a portage of half a league to reach a lake, the outlet of which fell into a very fine river, which took me down into the Mississippi. There I learned from eight cabins of Nadouecioux that the Rev. Father Louis Hennepin, Recollect, now at the convent of Saint Germain, with two other Frenchmen had been robbed, and carried off as slaves for more than three hundred leagues by the Nadouecioux themselves.\" The pine forests between the Saint Croix and Minnesota had been for several years a tempta tion to energetic men. As early as November, 1836, a Mr. Pitt went with a boat and a party of men to the Falls of Saint Croix to cut pine tim ber, with the consent of the Chippeways but the dissent of the United States authorities. In 1837 while the treaty was being made by Com missioners Dodge and Smith at Fort Snelling, on one Sunday Franklin Steele, Dr. Fitch, Jeremiah Russell, and a Mr. Maginnis left Fort Snelling for the Falls of Saint Croix in a birch bark canoe paddled by eight men, and reached that point about noon on Monday aud commenced a log cabin. Steele and Maginnis remained here, while the others, dividing into two parties, one under Fitch, and the other under Russell, search ed for pine land. The first stopped at Sun Rise, while Russel went on to the Snake River. About the same time Robbinet and Jesse B. Taylor came to the Falls in the interest of B. F. Baker who had a stone trading house near Fort Snelling, since destroyed by fire. On the fifteenth of July, 1838, the Palmyra, Capt. Holland, arrived at the Fort, with the official notice of the ratifica tion of the treaties ceding the lands between the Saint Croix and Mississippi. He then relates how he left two Frenchmen with his goods, and went with Ms interpreter and two Frenchmen in a canoe down the Mississippi, and after two days and two nights, found Henne pin, Accault and Augelle. He told Hennepin that he must return with him through the country of the Fox tribe, and writes : \" I preferred to re trace my steps, manifesting to them [the Sioux] the just indignation I felt against them, rather than to remain after the violence they had done She had on board C. A. Turtle, L. W. Stratton and others, with the machinery for the projected mills of the Northwest Lumber Company at the Falls of Saint Croix, and reached that point on the seventeenth, the first steamboat to disturb the waters above Lake Saint Croix. The steamer Gypsy came to the fort on the twenty-first of"], [127, "WOMEN IN THE VALLEY OF THE SAINT CROIX. 113 October, with goods for the Chippeways, and was chartered for four hundred and fifty dollars, to carry them up to the Falls of Saint Croix. In passing through the lake, the boat grounded near a projected town called Stambaughvdle, after S. C. Stambaugh, the sutler at the fort. On the afternoon of the 26th, the goods were landed, as stipulated. Until the year 1841, the jurisdiction of Craw ford county, Wisconsin, extended over the delta of country between the Saint Croix and Missis sippi. Joseph R. Brown having been elected as representative of the county, in the territorial legislature of Wisconsin, succeeded in obtaining the passage of an act on November twentieth, 1841, organizing the county of Saint Croix, with Dahkotah designated as the county seat. The agent of the Improvement Company at the falls was Washington Libbey, who left in the fall of 1838, and was succeeded by Jeremiah Russell, Stratton acting as millwright in place of Calvin Tuttle. On the twelfth of December, Russell and Stratton walked down the river, cut the first tree and built a cabin at Marine, and sold their claim. At the time prescribed for holding a court in the new county, it is said that the judge of the district arrived, and to his surprise, found a claim cabin occupied by a Frenchman. Speedily retreating, he never came again, and judicial proceedings for Saint Croix county ended for several years. Phineas Lawrence was the first sheriff of this county. The first women at the Falls of Saint Croix were a Mrs. Orr, Mrs. Sackett, and the daughter of a Mr. Young. During the winter of 1838-9, Jere miah Russell married a daughter of a respectable and gentlemanly trader, Charles H. Oakes. On the tenth of October, 1843, was commenced a settlement which has become the town of Still water. The names of the proprietors were John McKusick from Maine, Calvin Leach from Ver mont, Elam Greeley from Maine, and Elias McKean from Pennsylvania. They immediately commenced the erection of a sawmill. Among the first preachers were the Rev. W. T. Boutwell and Mr. Seymour, of the Chippeway Mission at Pokeguma. The Rev. A. Brunson, of Prairie du Chien, who visited this region in 1838, wrote that at the mouth of Snake River'he found Franklin Steele, with twenty-five or thirty men, cutting timber for a mill, and when he offered to preach Mr. Steele gave a cordial assent. John H. Fonda, elected on the twenty-second of September, as coroner of Crawford county, Wisconsin, asserts that he was once notified that a dead body was lying in the water opposite Pig's Eye slough, and immediately proceeded to the spot, and on taking it out, recognized it as the body of a negro woman belonging to a certain captain of the United States army then at Fort Crawford. The body was cruelly cut and bruised, but no one appearing to recognise it, a verdict of \" Found dead,\" was rendered, and the corpse was buried. Soon after, it came to light that the woman was whipped to death, and thrown into the river during the night. On the sixteenth of August, Mr. Steele, Living ston, and others, left the Falls of Saint Croix in a barge, and went around to Fort Snelling. The steamboat Fayette about the middle of May, 1839, landed sutlers' stores at Fort Snell ing and then proceeded with several persons of intelligence to the Saint Croix river, who settled at Marine. The place was called after Marine in Madison county, Illinois, where the company, consisting of Judd, Hone and others, was formed to budd a saw mill in the Saint Croix Valley. The mill at Marine commenced to saw lumber, on August 24, 1839, the first in Minnesota. The year that the Dahkotahs ceded their lands east of the Mississippi, a Canadian Frenchman by the name of Parrant, the ideal of an Indian whisky seller, erected a shanty in what is now the city of Saint Paul. Ignorant and overbear ing he loved money more than his own soul. Destitute of one eye, and the other resembling that of a pig, he was a good representative of Caliban. Some one writing from his groggery designated it as \" Pig's Eye.\" The reply to the letter was directed in good faith to \" Pig's Eye \" Joseph R. Brown, who since 1838, had lived at Chan Wakan, on the west side of Grey Cloud Island, this year made a claim near the upper end of the city of Stillwater, which he called Dahkotah, and was the first to raft lumber down the Saint Croix, as well as the first to represent the citizens of the valley in the legislature of Wisconsin. 8"], [128, "114 EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. Some years ago the editor of the Saint Paul Press described the occasion in these words : practices, he felt a kindly interest in the whites of Pig's Eye, which place was now beginning to be called, after a little log chapel which had been erected at the suggestion of Rev. L. Galtier, and called Saint Paul's. Though a missionary among the Dahkotahs, he was the first to take steps to promote the education of the whites and half breeds of Minnesota. In the year 1847, he wrote to ex-Governor Slade, President of the National Popular Education Society, in relation to the condition of what has subsequently become the capital of the state. \" Edmimd Brisette, a clerkly Frenchman for those days, who lives, or did live a little while ago, on Lake Harriet, was one day seated at a table in Parrant's cabin, with pen and paper about to write a letter for Parrant (for Parrant, like Charlemagre, could not write) to a friend of the latter in Canada. The question of geog raphy puzzled Brissette at the outset of the epistle; where should he date a letter from a place without a name ? He looked up inquir ingly to Parrant, and met the dead, cold glare of the Pig's Eye fixed upon him, with an irresist ible suggestiveness that was inspiration to Brisette.\" In accordance with his request, Miss H. E. Bishop came to his mission-house at Kaposia, and, after a short time, was introduced by him to the citizens of Saint Paul. The first school house in Minnesota besides those connected with the Indian missions, stood near the site of the old Brick Presbyterian church, corner of Saint Peter and Third street, and is thus described by the teacher : In 1842, the late Henry Jackson, of Mahkahto, settled at the same spot, and erected the first store on the height just above the lower landing, Roberts and Simpson followed, and opened small Indian trading shops. In 1846, the site of Saint Paul was chiefly occupied by a few7 shanties owned by \"certain lewd fellows of the baser sort,\" who sold rum to the soldier and Indian. It was despised by all decent white men, and known to the Dahkotahs by an expression in their tongue which means, the place where they sell minne-wakan [supernatural water]. \u2022' The school was commenced in a little log hovel, covered with bark, and chinked with mud, previously used as a blacksmith shop. On three sides of the interior of this humble log cabin, pegs were driven into the logs, upon which boards were laid for seats. Another seat was made by placing one end of a plank between the cracks of the logs, and the other upon a chair. This was for visitors. A rickety cross-legged table in the centre, and a hen's nest in one corner, com pleted the furniture.\" The chief of the Kaposia band in 1846, was shot by his own brother in a drunken revel, but sur viving the wound, and apparently alarmed at the deterioration under the influence of the modern harpies at Saint Paul, went to Mr. Bruce, Indian Agent, at Fort Snelling, and requested a mis sionary. The Indian Agent in his report to gov ernment, says : Saint Croix county, in the year 1847, was de tached from Crawford county, Wisconsin, and reorganized for judicial purposes, and Stillwater made the county seat. In the month of June the United States District Court held its session in the store-room of Mr. John McKusick ; Judge Charles Dunn presiding. A large number of lumbermen had been attracted by the pineries in the upper portion of the valley of Saint Croix, and Stillwater was looked upon as the center of the lumbering interest. \"The chief of the Little Crow's band, who re sides below this place (Fort Snelling) about nine miles, in the immediate neighbourhood of the whiskey dealers, has requested to have a school established at his village. He says they are de termined to reform, and for the future, will try to do better. I wrote to Doctor Williamson soon after the request was made, desiring him to take charge of the school. He has had charge of the mission school at Lac qui Parle for some years ; is well qualified, and is an excellent physician.\" The Rev. Mr. Boutwell, feeling that he could be more useful, left the Ojibways, and took up his residence near Stillwater, preaching to the lumbermen at the Falls of Saint Croix, Marine Mills, Stillwater, and Cottage Grove. In a letter speaking of Stillwater, he says, \" Here is a little village sprung up like a gourd, but whether it is to perish as soon, God only knows.\" In November, 1846, Dr. Williamson came from Lac qui Parle, as requested, and became a resi dent of Kaposia.

On the twenty-ninth of May, 1848, the act to admit Wisconsin changed the boundary line to the present, and as first defined in the enabling act of 1846. After the bill of Mr. Martin was introduced into the House of Representatives in 1846 it was referred to the Committee on Terri tories, of which Mr. Douglas was chairman. On the twentieth of January, 1847, he reported in favor of the proposed territory with the name of Itasca. On the seventeenth of February, be fore the bill passed the House, a discussion arose in relation to the proposed name. Mr. Win throp of Massachusetts proposed Chippewa as a substitute, alleging that this tribe was the prin cipal in the proposed territory, which was not correct. Mr. J. Thompson of Mississippi disliked all Indian names, and hoped the territory would be called Jackson. Mr. Houston of Delaware thought that there ought to be one territory named after the \" Father of his country,\" and proposed Washington. All of the names pro posed were rejected, and the name in the original bill inserted. On the last day of the session, March third, the bill was called up in the Senate and laid on the table. Three years elapsed from the time that the territory of Minnesota was proposed in Congress, to the final passage of the organic act. On the sixth of August, 1846, an act was passed by Con gress authorizing the citizens of Wisconsin Ter ritory to frame a constitution and form a state government. The act fixed the Saint Louis river to the rapids, from thence south to the Saint Croix, and thence down that river to its junction with the Mississippi, as the western boundary. On the twenty -third of December, 1846, the delegate from Wisconsin, Morgan L. Martin, in troduced a bill in Congress for the organization of a territory of Minnesota. This bill made its western boundary the Sioux and Red River of the North. On the third of March, 1847, per mission was granted to Wisconsin to change her boundary, so that the western limit would pro ceed due south from the first rapids of the Saint Louis river, and fifteen miles east of the most easterly point of Lake Saint Croix, thence to the Mississippi. \u2022 When Wisconsin became a state the query arose whether the old territorial government did not continue in force west of the Saint Croix river. The first meeting on the subject of claim ing territorial privileges was held in the building at Saint Paul, known as Jackson's store, near the corner of Bench and Jackson streets, on the bluff. This meeting was held in July, and a convention was proposed to consider their posi tion. The first public meeting was held at Still water on August fourth, and Messrs. Steele and Sibley were the only persons present from the west side of the Mississippi. This meeting is sued a call for a general convention to take steps to secure an early territorial organization, to assemble on the twenty-sixth of the month at A number in the constitutional convention of Wisconsin, were anxious that Rum river should be a part of her western boundary, while citizens of the valley of the Saint Croix were desirous that the Chippeway river should be the limit of Wisconsin. The citi zens of Wisconsin Territory , in the valley of the Saint Croix, and about Fort Snelling, wished to be included in the projected new territory, and on the twenty-eighth of March, 1848, a memorial signed by H. H. Sibley, Henry M. Rice, Franklin Steele, William R.

Sixty-two delegates answered the call, and among those present, were W. D. Phillips, J. W. Bass, A. Larpenteur, J. M. Boal, and others from Saint Paul. To the convention a letter was presented from Mr. Catlin, who claimed to be acting governor, giving his opinion that the Wisconsin territorial organization was still in force. The meeting also appointed Mr. Sibley to visit Washington and represent their views ; but the Hon. John H. Tweedy having resigned his office of delegate to Congress on September eighteenth, 1848, Mr. Catlin, who had made Stillwater a temporary residence, on the ninth of October issued a proclamation ordering a special election at Stillwater on the thirtieth, to fill a vacancy occasioned by the resignation. At this election Henry H. Sibley was elected as delegate of the citizens of the remaining portion of Wisconsin Territory. His credentials were presented to the House of Representatives, and the committee to whom the matter was referred presented a majority and minority report; but the resolution introduced by the majority passed and Mr. Sibley took his seat as a delegate from Wisconsin Territory on the fifteenth of January, 1849. The territory of Minnesota was named after the largest tributary of the Mississippi within its limits. The Sioux call the Missouri Minnesho shay, muddy water, but the stream after which this region is named, Minne-sota. Some say that Sota means clear; others, turbid; Schoolcraft, bluish green. Nicollet wrote. \"The adjective Sotah is of difficult translation. The Canadians translated it by a pretty equivalent word, brouille, perhaps more properly rendered into English by blear. I have entered upon this explanation be cause the word really means neither clear nor turbid, as some authors have asserted, its true meaning being found in the Sioux expression Ishtah-sotah, blear-eyed. \" From the fact that the word signifies neither blue nor white, but the peculiar appearance of the sky at certain times, by some, Minnesota has been defined to mean the sky tinted water, which is certainly poetic, and the late Rev. Gideon H. Pond thought quite corre'ct. Mr. H. M. Rice, and other gentlemen, visited Washington during the winter, and, uniting with Mr. Sibley, used all their energies to obtain the organization of a new territory.

Here and there a frame tenement was erected, and, under the auspices of the Hon. II. M. Rice, who had obtained an inter est in the town, some warehouses were con structed, and the foundations of- the American House, a frame hotel, which stood at Third and Exchange street, were laid. In 1849, the popu lation had increased to two hundred and fifty or three hundred inhabitants, for rumors had gone abroad that it might be mentioned in the act, creating the territory, as the capital of Minnesota. More than a month after the adjournment of Congress, just at eve, on the ninth of April, amid terrific peals of thunder and torrents of rain, the weekly steam packet, the first to force its way through the icy barrier of Lake Pepin, rounded the rocky point whistling loud and long, as if the bearer of glad tidings. Before she was safely moored to the landing, the shouts of the excited villagers were heard announcing that there was a territory of Minnesota, and that Saint Paul was the seat of government. On the third of March, 1849, the bill was passed by Congress for organizing the territory of Minnesota, whose boundary on the west, extended to the Missouri River. At this time, the region was little more than a wilderness. The west bank of the Mississippi, from the Iowa line to Lake Itasca, was unceded by the Indians. At Wapashaw, was a trading post in charge of Alexis Bailly, and here also resided the ancient voyageur, of fourscore years, A. Rocque. At the foot of Lake Pepin was a store house kept by Mr. F. S. Richards. On the west shore of the lake lived the eccentric Wells, whose wife was a bois brule, a daughter of the deceased trader, Duncan Graham. The two unfinished buildings of stone, on the beautiful bank opposite the renowned Maiden's Rock, and the surrounding skin lodges of his wife's relatives and friends, presented a rude but picturesque scene. Above the lake was a cluster of bark wigwams, the Dahkotah village of Raymneecha, now Red Wing, at which was a Presbyterian mission house. Every successive steamboat arrival poured out on the landing men big with hope, and anxious to do something to mould the future of the new state. Nine days after the news of the existence of the territory of Minnesota was received, there arrived James M. Goodhue with press, type, and printing apparatus. A graduate of Amherst college, and a lawyer by profession, he wielded a sharp pen, and wrote editorials, which, more than anything else, perhaps, induced immigration. Though a man of some faults, one of the counties properly bears his name. On the twenty-eighth of April, he issued from his press the first number of the Pioneer. The next settlement was Kaposia, also an In dian village, and the residence of a Presbyterian missionary, the Rev. T. S. Williamson, M. D. On the east side of the Mississippi, the first set tlement, at the mouth of the St. Croix, was Point Douglas, then as now, a small hamlet. At Red Rock, the site of a former Methodist mission station , there were a few farmers. Saint Paul was just emerging from a collection of In dian whisky shops and birch roofed cabins of On the twenty - seventh of May, Alexander Ramsey, the Governor, and family, arrived at Saint Paul, but owing to the crowded state of pub-"], [132, "EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. 118 the Baldwin School building, and the late Frank lin Steele was the marshal of the day. lie houses, immediately proceeded in the steamer to the establishment of the Fur Company, known as Mendota, at the junction of the Minnesota and Mississippi, and became the guest of the Hon. H. H. Sibley. On the seventh of July, a proclamation was is sued, dividing the territory into seven council districts, and ordering an election to be held on the first day of August, for one delegate to rep resent the people in the House of Representatives of the United States, for nine councillors and eighteen representatives, to constitute the Legis lative Assembly of Minnesota. On the first of June, Governor Ramsey, by pro clamation, declared the territory duly organized, with the following officers : Alexander Ramsey, of Pennsylvania, Governor ; C. K. Smith, of Ohio, Secretary, A. Goodrich, of Tennessee, Chief Justice ; D. Cooper, of Pennsylvania, and B. B. Meeker, of Kentucky, Associate Judges ; Joshua L. Taylor, Marshal ; H. L. Moss, attorney of the United States. In this month, the Hon. H. M. Rice despatch ed a boat laded with Indian goods from the the Falls of St. Anthony to Crow Wing, which was towed by horses after the maimer of a canal boat. On the eleventh of June, a second proclama tion was issued, dividing the territory into three temporary judicial districts. The first comprised the county of St. Croix ; the county of La Pointe and the region north and west of the Mississippi, and north of the Minnesota and of a line running due west from the headwaters of the Minnesota to the Missouri river, constituted the second ; and the country west of the Mississippi and south of the Minnesota, formed the third district. Judge Goodrich was assigned to the first, Meeker to the second, and Cooper to the third. A court was ordered to be held at Stillwater on the second Monday, at the Falls of St. Anthony on the third, and at Mendota on the fourth Monday of August. The election on the first of August, passed off with little excitement, Hon. H, H. Sibley being elected delegate to Congress without opposition. David Lambert, on what might, perhaps, be termed the old settlers' ticket, was defeated in St. Paul, by James M. Boal. The latter, on the night of the election, was honored with a ride through town on the axle and fore-wheels of an old wagon, which was drawn by his admiring but somewhat undisciplined friends. J. L. Taylor having declined the office of United States Marshal; A. M. Mitchell, of Ohio, a graduate of West Point, and colonel of a regi ment of Ohio volunteers in the Mexican war, was appointed and arrived at the capital early in August. Until the twenty -sixth of June, Governor Ramsey and family had been guests of Hon. H. H. Sibley, at Mendota. On the afternoon of that day they arrived at St. Paul, in a birch-bark canoe, and became permanent residents at the capital. The house first occupied as a guber natorial mansion, was a small frame building that stood on Third, between Robert and Jackson streets, formerly known as the New England House. There were three papers published in the ter ritory soon after its organization. The first was the Pioneer, issued on April twenty-eighth, 1849, under most discouraging circumstances. It was at first the intention of the witty and reckless editor to have called his paper \" The Epistle of St. Paul.\" About the same time there was issued in Cincinnati, under the auspices of the late Dr. A. Randall, of California, the first number of the Register. The second number of the paper was printed at St. Paul, in July, and the office was on St. Anthony, between Washington and Market Streets, About the first of June, James Hughes, afterward of Hudson, Wisconsin, arrived with a press and materials, and established the Minnesota Chronicle. After an existence of a few weeks two papers were discontinued ; and, in their place, was issued the \" Chronicle and A few days after, the Hon. II. M. Rice and family moved from Mendota to St. Paul, and oc cupied the house he had erected on St. Anthony street, near the corner of Market. On the first of July, a land office was estab lished at Stillwater, and A. Van Vorhes, after a few weeks, became the register. The anniversary of our National Independence was celebrated in a becoming manner at the cap ital. The place selected for the address, was a grove that stood on the sites of the City Hall and"], [133, "DESCRIPTION OF THE TEMPORARY CAPITOL. 119 Register,\" edited by Nathaiel McLean and John P. Owens. written, and its perusal afforded satisfaction at home and abroad. The first courts, pursuant to proclamation of the governor, were held in the month of August. At Stillwater, the court was organized on the thirteenth of the month, Judge Goodrich pre siding, and Judge Cooper by courtesy, sitting on the bench. On the twentieth, the second judi cial district held a court. The room used was the old government mill at Minneapolis. The presiding judge was B. B. Meeker; the foreman of the grand jury, Franklin Steele. On the last Monday of the month, the court for the third judicial district was organized in the large stone warehouse of the fur company at Mendota. The presiding judge was David Cooper. Governor Ramsey sat on the right, and Judge Goodrich on the left. Hon. H. II. Sibley was the foreman of the grand jury. As some of the jurors could not speak the English language, W. II. Forbes acted as interpreter. The charge of Judge Cooper was lucid, scholarly, and dignified. At the request of the grand jury it was afterwards published. The first session of the legislature adjourned on the first of November. Among other proceed ings of interest, was the creation of the following counties: Itasca, Wapashaw, Dahkotah, Wah nahtah, Mahkahto, Pembina Washington, Ram sev and Benton. The three latter counties com prised the country that up to that time had been ceded by the Indians on the east side of the Mis sissippi, StiV water was declared the county seat of Washington, Saint Paul, of Ramsey, and \" the seat of justice of the county of Benton was to be within one-quarter of a mile of a point on the east side of the Mississippi, directly opposite the mouth of Sauk river.\" EVENTS OF A. D 1850. By the active exertions of the secretary of ttm territory, C. K. Smith, Esq., the Historical Society of Minnesota was incorporated at the first session of the legislature. The opening an nual address was delivered in the then Methodist (now Swedenborgian) church at Saint Paul, on the first of January, 1850. On Monday, the third of September, the first Legislative Assembly convened in the \" Central House,\" in Saint Paul, a building at the corner of Minnesota and Bench streets, facing the Mississippi river which answered the double purpose of capitol and hotel. On the first floor of the main building was the Secreta ry's office and Representative chamber, and in the second story was the library and Council chamber. As the flag was run up the staff in front of the house, a number of Indians sat on a rocky bluff in the vicinity, and gazed at what to them was a novel and perhaps saddening scene ; for if the tide of immigration sweeps in from the Pacific as it has from the Atlantic coast, they must soon dwindle. The following account of the proceedings is from the Chronicle and Register. \"The first public exercises of the Minnesota Historical Society, took place at the Methodist church, Saint Paul, on the first inst., and passed off highly creditable to all concerned. The day was pleasant and the attendance large. At the appointed hour, the President and both Vice-Presidents of the society being absent ; on motion of Hon. C. K. Smith, Hon. Chief Justice Goodrich was called to the chair. The same gentleman then moved that a committee, consisting of Messrs. Parsons K. Johnson, John A. Wakefield, and B. W. Brunson, be appointed to wait upon the Orator of the day, Rev. Mr. Neill, and inform him that the audience was waiting to hear his address. The legislature having organized, elected the following permanent officers: David Olmsted, President of Council ; Joseph R. Brown, Secre ary; II. A. Lambert, Assistant. In the House of Representatives, Joseph W. Furber was elect ed Speaker : W. D. Phillips, Clerk : L. B. Wait, Assistant. \" Mr. Neill was shortly conducted to the pulpit; and after an eloquent and approriate prayer by the Rev. Mr. Parsons, and music by the band, he proceeded to deliver his discourse upon the early French missionaries and Voyageurs into Minne sota. We hope the society wdl provide for its publication at an early day. On Tuesday afternoon, both houses assembled in the dining hall of the hotel, and after prayer was offered by Rev. E. D. Neill, Governor Ram sey delivered his message. The message was ably \"After some brief remarks by Rev.

In youth he had been a member of the Columbia Fur Com pany, and conforming to the habits of traders, had purchased a Dahkotah wife who was wholly ignorant of the English language. As a family of children gathered around him he recognised the relation of husband and father, and consci entiously discharged his duties as a parent. His daughter at a proper age was sent to a boarding school of some celebrity, and on the night re ferred to was married to an intelligent young American farmer. Among the guests present were the officers of the garrison in full uniform, with their wives, the United States Agent for the Dahkotahs, and family, the bois brules of the neighborhood, and the Indian relatives of the mother. The mother did not make her appear ance, but, as the minister proceeded with the ceremony, the Dahkotah relatives, wrapped in their blankets, gathered in the hall and looked in through the door. Hobart, upon the objects and ends of history, the ceremonies were concluded with a prayer by that gentleman. The audience dispersed highly delighted with all that occurred.\" At this early period the Minnesota Pioneer issued a Carrier's New Year's Address, which was amusing doggerel. The reference to the future greatness and ignoble origin of the capital of Minnesota was as follows : \u2014 The cities on this river must be three, Two that are built and one that is to be. One, is the mart of all the tropics yield, The cane, the orange, and the cotton-field, And sends her ships abroad and boasts Her trade extended to a thousand coasts ; The other, central for the temperate zone, Garners the stores that on the plains are grown, A place where steamboats from all quarters, range, To meet and speculate, as 'twere on 'change. The third will le, where rivers confluent flow From the wide spreading north through plains of snow ; The marriage feast was worthy of the occa sion. In consequence of the numbers, the officers and those of European extraction partook first; then the bois brules of Ojibway and Dah kotah descent; and, finally, the native Ameri cans, who did ample justice to the plentiful sup ply spread before them. The mart of all that boundless forests give To make mankind more comfortably live, The land of manufacturing industry, The workshop of the nation it shall be.

Sibley, and the delegate to Congress devised at Washington, this winter, the territorial seal. The design was Falls of St. Anthony in the distance.

An Indian, amazed at the sight of the plough, and fleeing on horseback towards the setting sun.

Yes ; Pig's Eye ! That's the spot ! The motto of the Earl of Dunraven, \"Qu\u00e6 sursum volo videre\". (I wish to see what is above) was most appropriately selected by Mr. Sibley, but by the blunder of an engraver it appeared on the territorial seal, \"Quo sursum. velo videre,\" which no scholar could translate. At length was substituted, \"L' Etoile du Nord,\" \"Star of the North,\" while the device of the setting sun remained, and this is objectionable, as the State of Maine had already placed the North Star on her escutcheon, with the motto \"Dirigo,\" \"I guide.\" Perhaps some future legislature may A very funny name ; is't not ? Pig's Eye's the spot, to plant my city on, To be remembered by, when I am gone. Pig's Eye converted thou shalt be, like Saul : Thy name henceforth shall be Saint Paul. On the evening of New Year's day, at Fort Snelling, there was an assemblage which is only seen on the outposts of civilization. In one of the stone edifices, outside of the wall, belonging to the United States, there resided a gentleman who had dwelt in Minnesota since the year 1819,"], [135, "SCALP DANCE IN STILLWATER. 121 direct the first motto to be restored and correctly engraved. the Falls of St. Anthony. The boat loft the fort after dinner, with Governor Ramsey and other guests, also the band of the Sixth Regiment on board, and reached the falls between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. The whole town, men, women and children, lined the shore as the boat approached, and welcomed this first arrival, with shouts and waving handkerchiefs. In the montn of April, there was a renewal of hostilities between the Dahkotahs and Ojibways, on lands that had been ceded to the Umted States. A war -prophet at Red Wing, dreamed that he ought to raise a war party. Announcing the fact, a number expressed their willingness to go on such an expedition. Several from the Kaposia village also joined the party, under the leadership of a worthless Indian, who had been confined in the guard-house at Fort Snelling, the year previous, for scalping his wife. On the afternoon of May fifteenth, there might have been seen, hurrying through the streets of Saint Paul, a number of naked and painted braves of the Kaposia band of Dahkotahs, ornamented with all the attire of war, and panting for the scalps of their enemies. A few hours before, the warlike head chief of the Ojibways, young Hole in-the-Day , having secreted his canoe in the retired gorge which leads to the cave in the upper sub urbs, with two or three associates had crossed the river, and, almost in sight of the citizens of the town, had attacked a small party of Dahkotahs. and murdered and scalped one man. On receipt of the news, Governor Ramsey granted a parole to the thirteen Dahkotahs confined in Fort Snell ing, for participating in the Apple river massacre. Passing up the valley of the St. Croix, a rew miles above Stillwater the party discovered on the snow the marks of a keg and footprints. These told them that a man and woman of the Ojibways had been to some whisky dealer's, and were re turning. Following their trail, they found on Apple river, about twenty miles from Stillwater, a band of O j ibways encamped in one lodge. Waitr ing till daybreak of Wednesday, April second, the Dahkotahs commenced firing on the unsuspecting inmates, some of whom were drinking from the contents of the whisky keg. The camp was com posed of fifteen, and all were murdered and scalp ed, with the exception of a lad, who was made a captive. On the morning of the sixteenth of May, the first Protestant church edifice completed in the white settlements, a small frame bnilding, built for the Presbyterian church, at Saint Paul, was destroyed by fire, it being the first conflagration that had occurred since the organization of the territory. On Thursday, the victors came to Stillwater, and danced the scalp dance around the captive boy, in the heat of excitement, striking him in the face with the scarcely cold and bloody scalps of his relatives. The child was then taken to Ka posia, and adopted by the chief. Governor Ram sey immediately took measures to send the boy to his friends. At a conference held at the Gov ernor's mansion, the boy was delivered up, and, on being led out to the kitchen by a little son of the Governor, since deceased, to receive refresh ments, he cried bitterly, seemingly more alarmed at being left with the whites than he had been while a captive at Kaposia. One of the most interesting events of the year 1850, was the Indian council, at Fort Snelling. Governor Ramsey had sent runners to the differ ent bands of the Ojibways and Dahkotahs, to meet him at the fort, for the purpose of en deavouring to adjust their difficulties. On Wednesday, the twelfth of June, after much talking, as is customary at Indian councils, the two tribes agreed as they had frequently done before, to be friendly, and Governor Ramsey presenting to each party an ox. the council was dissolved. From the first of April the waters of the Mis sissippi began to rise, and on the thirteenth, the lower floor of the warehouse, then occupied by William Constans, at the foot of Jackson street, St. Paul, was submerged. Taking advantage of the freshet, the steamboat Anthony Wayne, for a purse of two hundred dollars, ventured through the swift current above Fort Snelling, and reached On Thursday, the Ojibways visited St. Paul for the first time, young Hole-in-the-Day being dressed in a coat of a captain of United States infantry, which had been presented to him at the fort. On Friday, they left in the steamer Gov ernor Ramsey, which had been built at St. An thony, and just commenced running between"], [136, "122 EXPLORERS AND PIOA'EERS OF MINNESOTA. that point and Sauk Rapids, for their homes in the wilderness of the Upper Mississippi. correct information in relation to the habits, the belief, and superstitions, of the Dahkotahs. On the tenth of December, a new paper, owned and edited by Daniel A. Robertson, late United States marshal, of Ohio, and called the Minne sota Democrat, made its appearance. The summer of 1850 was the commencement of the navigation of the Minnesota River by steamboats. With the exception of a steamer that made a pleasure excursion as far as Shokpay, in 1841, no large vessels had ever disturbed the waters of this stream. In June, the \" Anthony Wayne,\" which a few weeks before had ascended to the Falls of St. Anthony, made a trip. On the eighteenth of July she made a second trip, going almost to Mahkahto. The \" Nominee \" also navigated the stream for some distance. During the summer there had been changes in the editorial supervision of the \" Chronicle and Register.\" For a brief period it was edited by L. A. Babcock, Esq., who was succeeded by W. G. Le Due. About the time of the issuing of the Demo crat, C. J. Hemiiss, formerly reporter for the United States Gazette, Phdadelphia, became the editor of the Chronicle. On the twenty-second of July the officers of the \" Yankee,\" taking advantage of the high water, determined to navigate the stream as far as possible. The boat ascended to near the Cot tonwood river. The first proclamation for a thanksgiving day was issued in 1850 by the governor, and the twenty-sixth of December was the time appointed and it was generally observed. As the time for the general election in Septem ber approached, considerable excitement was manifested. As there were no political issues before the people, parties were formed based on personal preferences. Among those nominated for delegate to Congress, by various meetings, were II. II. Sibley, the former delegate to Con gress, David Olmsted, at that time engaged in the Indian trade, and A. M. Mitchell, the United States marshal. Mr. Olmsted withdrew his name before election day, and the contest was between those interested in Sibley and Mitchell. The friends of each betrayed the greatest zeal, and neither pains nor money were spared to in sure success. Mr. Sibley was elected by a small majority. For the first time in the territory, soldiers at the garrisons voted at this election, and there was considerable discussion as to the propriety of such a course. EVENTS OF A. D. 1851. On Wednesday, January first, 1851, the second Legislative Assembly assembled in a three-story brick building, since destroyed by fire, that stood on St. Anthony street, between Washington and Franklin. D. B. Loomis was chosen Speaker of the Council, and M. E. Ames Speaker of the House. This assembly was characterized by more bitterness of feeling than any that has since convened. The preceding delegate election had been based on personal preferences, and cliques and factions manifested themselves at an early period of the session. The locating of the penitentiary at Stillwater, and the capitol building at St. Paul gave some dissatisfaction. By the efforts of J. W. North, Esq., a bill creating the University of Minnesota at or near the Falls of St. Anthony, was passed, and signed by the Governor. This institution, by the State Constitution, is now the State Uni versity. Miss Fredrika Bremer, the well known Swedish novelist, visited Minnesota in the month of October, and was the guest of Governor Ramsey. During November, the Dahkotah Tawaxitku Kin, or the Dahkotah Friend, a monthly paper, was commenced, one-half in the Dahkotah and one-half in the English language. Its editor was the Rev. Gideon II. Pond, a Presbyterian mis sionary, and its place of publication at Saint Paul. It was published for nearly two years, and, though it failed to attract the attention of the Indian mind, it conveyed to the English reader much During the session of this Legislature, the pub lication of the \" Chronicle and Register\" ceased. About the middle of May, a war party of Dah kotahs discovered near Swan River, an Ojibway with a keg of whisky. The latter escaped, with the loss of his keg. The war party, drinking the contents, became intoxicated, and, firing upon some teamrters they met driving their wagons with goods to the Indian Agency, killed one of"], [137, "LANDS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI CEDED. 123 them, Andrew Swartz, a resident of St. Paul. The news was conveyed to Fort Ripley, and a party of soldiers, with Hole-in-the-Day as a guide, started in pursuit of the murderers, but did not succeed in capturing them. Through the influ ence of Little Six the Dahkotah chief, whose vil lage was at (and named after him) Shok pay, five of the offienders were arrested and placed in the guard-house at Fort Snelling. On Monday, June ninth, they left the fort in a wagon, guarded by twenty-five dragoons, destined for Sauk Rapids for trial. As they departed they all sang their death song, and the coarse soldiers amused themselves by making signs that they were going to be hung. On the first evening of the journey the five culprits encamped with the twenty-five dragoons. Handcuffed, they were placed in the tent, and yet at midnight they all escaped, only one being wounded by the guard. What was more remarkable, the wounded man was the first to bring the news to St. Paul. Pro ceeding to Kaposia, his wound was examined by the missionary and physician, Dr. Williamson ; and then, fearing an arrest, he took a canoe and paddled up the Minnesota. The excuse offered by the dragoons was, that all the guard but one fell asleep. and Ramsey, it was passed to the chiefs. The paper containing the treaty was then read in English and translated into the Dahkotah by the Rev. S. R. Riggs, Presbyterian Missionary among this people. This finished, the chiefs came up to the secretary's table and touched the pen; the white men present then witnessed the document, and nothing remained but the ratification of the United States Senate to open that vast country for the residence of the hardy immigrant. During* the first week in August, a treaty was also concluded beneath an oak bower, on Pilot Knob, Mendota, with the M'dewakantonwan and Wahpaykootay bands of Dahkotahs. About sixty of the chiefs and principal men touched the pen, and Little Crow, who had been in the mission school at Lac qui Parle, signed Ids own name. Before they separated, Colonel Lea and Governor Ramsey gave them a few words of advice on various subjects connected with their future well being, but particularly on the subject of educa tion and temperance. The treaty was interpret ed to them by the Rev. G. II. Pond, a gentleman who was conceded to be a most correct speaker of the Dahkotah tongue. The day after the treaty these lower bands received thirty thousand dollars, winch, by the treaty of 1837, was set apart for education ; but, by the misrepresentations of interested half breeds, the Indians were made to believe that it ought to be given to them to be employed as they pleased. The first paper published in Minnesota, beyond the capital, was the St. Anthony Express, which made its appearance during the last week of April or May. The most important event of the year 1851 was the treaty with the Dahkotahs, by which the west side of the Mississippi and the valley of the Minnesota River were opened to the hardy immi grant. The commissioners on the part of the United States were Luke Lea, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and Governor Ramsey. The place of meeting for the upper bands was Trav erse des Sioux. The commission arrived there on the last of June, but were obliged to wait many days for the assembling of the various bands of Dahkotahs. The next week, with their sacks filled with money, they thronged the streets of St. Paul, purchasing whatever pleased their fancy. On the seventeenth of September, a new paper wras commenced in St. Paul, under the auspices of the \"Whigs,\" and John P. Owens became editor, which relation he sustained until the fall of 1857. The election for members of the legislature and county officers occurred on the fourteenth of October ; and, for the first time, a regular Demo cratic ticket was placed before the people. The parties called themselves Democratic and Anti organization, or Coalition. On the eighteenth of July, all those expected having arrived, the Sissetoans and Wahpaytoan Dahkotahs assembled in grand council with the United States commissioners. After the usual feastings and speeches, a treaty was concluded on Wednesday, July twenty-third. The pipe having been smoked by the commissioners, Lea In the month of November Jerome Fuller ar rived, and took the place of Judge Goodrich as Chief Justice of Minnesota, who was removed ; and, about the same time, Alexander Wilkin was"], [138, "124 EXPLORERS AND PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA. appointed secretary of the territory in place of C. K. Smith. his death, to hew timber. While there he was fired upon by a small party of Dahkotahs ; a ball broke his arm, and he was pierced with arrows. His scalp was wrenched from his head, and was afterwards seen among Sisseton Dahkotahs, near Big Stone Lake. The eighteenth of December, pursuant to proclamation, was observed as a day of Thanks giving. EVENTS OF A. D. 1852. About the last of August, the pioneer editor of Minnesota, James M. Goodhue, died. The third Legislative Assembly commenced its sessions in one of the edifices on Third below Jackson street, which became a portion of the Merchants' Hotel, on the seventh of January, 1852. At the November Term of the United States District Court, of Ramsey comity, a Dahkotah, named Yu-ha-zee, was tried for the murder of a German woman. With others she was travel ing above Shokpay, when a party of Indians, of whom the prisoner was one, met them ; and, gathering about the wagon, were much excited. The prisoner punched the woman first with his gun, and, being threatened by one of the party, loaded and fired, killing the woman and wound ing one of the men. This session, compared with the previous, formed a contrast as great as that between a boisterous day in March and a calm June morn ing. The minds of the population were more deeply interested in the ratification of the treaties made with the Dahkotahs, than in political dis cussions. Among other legislation of interest was the creation of Hennepin county. On the day of his trial he was escorted from Fort Snelling by a company of mounted dragoons in full dress. It was an impressive scene to witness the poor Indian half hid in his blanket, in a buggy with the civil officer, surrounded with all the pomp and circumstance of war. The jury found him guilty. On being asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed, he replied, through the interpreter, that the band to which he belonged would remit their annuities if he could be released. To this Judge Hayner, the successor of Judge Fuller, replied, that he had no authority to release him; and, ordering him to rise, after some appropriate and impressive remarks, he pro nounced the first sentence of death ever pro nounced by a judicial officer in Minnesota. The prisoner trembled while the judge spoke, and was a piteous spectacle. By the statute of Min nesota, then, one convicted of murder coidd not be executed until twelve months had elapsed, and he was confined until the governor of the ter orrity should by warrant order his execution. On Saturday, the fourteenth of February, a dog-train arrived at St. Paul from the north, with the distinguished Arctic explorer, Dr. Rae. He had been in search of the long-missing Sir John Franklin, by way of the Mackenzie river, and was now on his way to Europe. On the fourteenth of May, an interesting lusus natur\u00e6 occurred at Stillwater. On the prairies, beyond the elevated bluffs which encircle the business portion of the town, there is a lake which discharges its waters through a ravine, and sup plied McKusick's mill. Owing to heavy rains, the hills became saturated with water, and the lake very full. Before daylight the citizens heard the \" voice of many waters,\" and looking out, saw rushing down through the ravine, trees, gravel and diluvium. Nothing impeded its course, and as it issued from the ravine it spread over the town site, covering up barns and small tenements, and, continuing to the lake shore, it materially improved the landing, by a deposit of many tons of earth. One of the editors of the day, alluding to the fact, quaintly remarked, that \"it was a very extraordinary movement of real estate.\" EVENTS OF A. D. 1853. During the summer, Elijah Terry, a young man who had left St. Paul the previous March, and went to Pembina, to act as teacher to the mixed bloods in that vicinity, was murdered un der distressing circumstances. With a bois brule he had started to the woods on the morning of The fourth Legislative Assembly convened on the fifth of January, 1853, in the two story brick edifice at the corner of Third and Minnesota streets.

Governor Ramsey's message was an interesting document. typed, and which was engraved for Graham's Magazine, wallowed in gore. The Baldwin school, now known as Macalester College, was incorporated at this session of the legislature, and was opened the following June. On the ninth of April, a party of Ojibways killed a Dahkotah, at the village of Shokpay. A war party, from Kaposia, then proceeded up the valley of the St. Croix, and killed an Ojibway. On the morning of the twenty-seventh, a band of Ojibway warriors, naked, decked, and fiercely gesticulating, might have been seen in the busiest street of the capital, in search of their enemies. Just at that time a small party of women, and one man, who had lost a leg in the battle of Still water, arrived in a canoe from Kaposia, at the Jackson street landing. Perceiving the Ojib ways, they retreated to the building then known as the \" Pioneer \" office, and the Ojibways dis charging a volley through the windows, wounded a Dahkotah woman who soon died. For a short time, the infant capital presented a sight similar to that witnessed in ancient days in Hadley or Deerfield, the then frontier towns of Massachusetts. Messengers were despatched to Fort Snelling for the dragoons, and a party of citizens mounted on horseback, were quickly in pursuit of those who with so much boldness had sought the streets of St. Paul, as a place to avenge their wrongs. The dragoons soon fol lowed, with Indian guides scenting the track of the Ojibways, like bloodhounds. The next day they discovered the transgressors, near the Falls of St. Croix. The Ojibways manifesting what was supposed to be an insolent spirit, the order was given by the lieutenant in command, to fire, and he whose scalp was afterwards daguerreo During the summer, the passenger, as he stood on the hurricane deck of any of the steamboats, might have seen, on a scaffold on the bluffs in the rear of Kaposia, a square box covered with a coarsely fringed red cloth. Above it was sus pended a piece of the Ojibway's scalp, whose death had caused the affray in the streets of St. Paul. Within, was the body of the woman who had been shot in the \" Pioneer \" building, while seeding refuge. A scalp suspended over the corpse is supposed to be a consolation to the soul, and a great protection in the journey to the spirit land. On the accession of Pierce to the presidency of the United States, the officers appointed under the Taylor and Fillmore administrations were removed, and the following gentlemen substitu ted : Governor, W. A. Gorman, of Indiana ; Sec retary, J. T. Rosser, of Virginia ; Chief Justice. W. H. Welch, of Minnesota ; Associates, Moses Sherburne, of Maine, and A. G. Chatfield, of Wisconsin. One of the first official acts of the second Governor, was the making of a treaty with the Winnebago Indians at Watab, Benton county, for an exchange of country. On the twenty-ninth of June, D. A. Robertson, who by his enthusiasm and earnest advocacy of its principles had done much to organize the Democratic party of Minnesota, retired from the editorial chair and was succeeded by David Olm sted. At the election held in October, Henry M. Rice and Alexander Wilkin were candidates for deligate to Congress.

EVENTS OF A. D. 1855. The sixth session of the legislature convened on the third of January, 1855. W. P. Murray was elected President of the Council, and James S. Norris Speaker of the House. The fifth session of the legislature was com menced in the building just' completed as the Capitol, on January fourth, 1854. The President of the Council was S. B. Olmstead, and the Speak er of the House of Representatives was N. C. D. Taylor. About the last of January, the two houses ad journed one day, to attend the exercises occa sioned by the opening of the first bridge of any kind, over the mighty Mississippi, from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico. It was at Falls of Saint Anthony, and made of wire, and at the time of its opening, the patent for the land on which the west piers were built, had not been issued from the Land Office, a striking evi dence of the rapidity with which the city of Minneapolis, which now surrounds the Falls, has developed. Governor Gorman delivered his first annual message on the tenth, and as his predecessor, urged the importance of railway communications, and dwelt upon the necessity of fostering the in terests of education, and of the lumbermen. The exciting bill of the session was the act in corporating the Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad Company, introduced by Joseph R. Brown. It was passed after the hour of midnight on the last day of the session. Contrary to the expectation of his friends, the Governor signed the bill. On the twenty-ninth of March, a convention was held at Saint Anthony, which led to the formation of the Republican party of Minnesota. This body took measures for the holding of a territorial convention at St. Paul, which con vened on the twenty-fifth of July, and William R. Marshall was nominated as delegate to Con gress. Shortly after the friends of Mr. Sibley nominated David Olmsted and Henry M. Rice, the former delegate was also a candidate. The contest was animated, and resulted in the elec tion of Mr. Rice. On the afternoon of December twenty-seventh, the first public execution in Minnesota, in accord ance with the forms of law, took place. Yu-ha zee, the Dahkotah who had been convicted in November, 1852, for the murder of a German woman, above Shokpay, was the individual. The scaffold was erected on the open space be tween an inn called the Franklin House and the rear of the late Mr. J. W. Selby's enclosure in St. Paul. About two o'clock, the prisoner, dressed in a white shroud, left the old log pris on, near the court house, and entered a carriage with the officers of the law. Being assisted up the steps that led to the scaffold, he made a few remarks in his own language, and was then exe cuted. Numerous ladies sent in a petition to the governor, asking the pardon of the Indian, to which that officer in declining made an appro priate reply. About noon of December twelfth, 1855, a four horse vehicle was seen driving rapidly through St. Paul, and deep was the interest when it was announced that one of the Arctic exploring party, Mr. James Stewart, was on his way to Canada with relics of the world - renowned and world mourned Sir John Franklin. Gathering together the precious fragments found on Montreal Island and vicinity, the party had left the region of ice bergs on the ninth of August, and after a con tinued land journey from that time, had reached"], [141, "PROPOSED REMOVAL OF THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT. 127 Saint Paul on that day, en route to the Hudson Bay Company's quarters in Canada. Mr. Balcombe moved that further proceedings under the call be dispensed with ; which did not prevail. From that time until the next Thursday afternoon, March the fifth, a period of one hun dred and twenty-three hours, the Council re mained in their chamber without recess. At that time a motion to adjourn prevailed. On Friday another motion was made to dispense with the call of the Council, which did not prevail. On Saturday, the Council met, the president declared the call still pending. At seven and a half p. m, a committee of the House was. announced. The chair ruled, that no communication from the House could be received while a call of the Coun cil was pending, and the committee withdrew. A motion was again made during the last night of the session, to dispense with all further pro ceedings under the call, which prevaded, with one vote only in the negative. EVENTS OF A. D. 1856. The seventh session of the Legislative Assem bly was begun on the second of January, 1856, and again the exciting question was the Minne sota and Northwestern Railroad Company. John B. Brisbin was elected President of the Council, and Charles Gardner, Speaker of the House. This year was comparatively devoid of interest. The citizens of the territory were busily engaged in making claims in newly organized counties, and in enlarging the area of civilization. On the twelfth of June, several Ojibways entered the farm house of Mr. Whallon, who re sided in Hennepin county, on the banks of the Minnesota, a mile below the Bloomington ferry. The wife of the farmer, a friend, and three child ren, besides a little Dahkotah girl, who had been brought up in the mission-house at Kaposia, and so changed in manners that her origin was scarcely perceptible, were sitting in the room when the Indians came in. Instantly seizing the little Indian maiden, they threw her out of the door, killed and scalped her, and fled before the men who were near by, in the field, could reach the house. Mr. Ludden then moved that a committee be appointed to wait on the Governor, and inquire if he had any further communication to make to the Council. Mr. Lowry moved a call of the Council, which was ordered, and the roll being called, Messrs. Rolette, Thompson and Tillotson were absent. At twelve o'clock at night the president re sumed the chair, and announced that the time limited by law for the continuation of the session of the territorial legislature had expired, and he therefore declared the Council adjourned and the seat of government remained at Saint Paul. EVENTS OF A. D. 1857. The procurement of a state organization, and a grant of lands for railroad purposes, were the topics of political interest during the year 1857. The excitement on the capital question was in tense, and it was a strange scene to see members of the Council, eating and sleeping hi the hall of legislation for days, waiting for the sergeant-at arms to report an absent member in his seat. The eighth Legislative Assembly convened at the capitol on the seventh of January, and J. B. Brisbin was elected President of the Council, and J. W. Furber, Speaker of the House. A bill changing the seat of government to Saint Peter, on the Minnesota River, caused much discussion. On the twenty-third of February, 1857, an act passed the United States Senate, to authorize the people of Minnesota to form a constitution, preparatory to their admission into the Union on an equal footing with the original states. On Saturday, February twenty -eighth, Mr. Balcombe offered a resolution to report the bill for the removal of the seat of government, and should Mr. Rolette, chairman of the committee, fail, that W. W. Wales, of said committee, report a copy of said bill. Governor Gorman called a special session of the legislature, to take into consideration measures that would give efficiency to the act. The extra session convened on April twenty seventh, and a message was transmitted by Sam uel Medary, who had been appointed governor in place of W. A. Gorman, whose term of office Mr. Setzer, after the reading of the resolution, moved a call of the Council, and Mr. Rolette was found to be absent.

According to the provision of the consti tution, an election was held for state officers and the adoption of the constitution, on the second Tuesday, the thirteenth of October. The constitution was adopted by almost a unanimous vote. It provided that the territorial officers should retain their offices until the state was ad mitted into the Union, not anticipating the long delay which was experienced. had expired. The extra session adjourned on the twenty-third of May; and in accordance with the provisions of the enabling act of Con gress, an election was held on the first Monday in June, for delegates to a convention which was to assemble at the capitol on the second Monday in July. The election resulted, as was thought, in giving a majority of delegates to the Republi can party. At midnight previous to the day fixed for the meeting of the convention, the Republicans pro ceeded to the capitol, because the enabling act had not fixed at what hour on the second Mon day the convention should assemble, and fear ing that the Democratic delegates might antici pate them, and elect the officers of the body. A little before twelve, A. M., on Monday, the secretary of the territory entered the speaker's rostrum, and began to call the body to order; and at the same time a delegate, J. W. North, who had in his possession a written request from the majority of the delegates present, proceeded to do the same thing. The secretary of the ter ritory put a motion to adjourn, and the Demo cratic members present voting in the affirmative, they left the hall. The Republicans, seeling that they were in the majority, remained, and in due time organized, and proceeded with the business specified in the enabling act, to form a constitu tion, and. take all necessary steps for the estab lishment of a state government, in conformity with the Federal Constitution, subject to the approval and ratification of the people of the proposed state. The first session of the state legislature com menced on the first Wednesday of December, at the capitol, in the city of Saint Paul ; and during the month elected Henry M. Rice and James Shields as their Representatives in the United States Senate. EVENTS OF A. D. 1858. On the twenty-ninth of January, 1858, Mr. Douglas submitted a bill to the United States Senate, for the admission of Minnesota into the Union. On the first of February, a discussion arose on the bill, in which Senators Douglas, Wilson, Gwin, Hale, Mason, Green, Brown, and Crittenden participated. Brown, of Mississippi, was opposed to the admission of Minnesota, un til the Kansas question was settled. Mr. Crit tenden, as a Southern man, could not endorse ;il that was said by the Senator from Mississippi; and his words of wisdom and moderation during this day's discussion, were worthy of remem brance. On April the seventh, the bill passed the Senate with only three dissenting votes ; and in a short time the House of Representatives concurred, and on May the eleventh, the Presi dent approved, and Minnesota was fully rec ognized as one of the United States of America. After several days the Democratic wing also organized in the Senate chamber at the capitol, and, claiming to be the true body, also proceeded to form a constitution. Both parties were re markably orderly and intelligent, and everything was marked by perfect decorum. After they had been in session some weeks, moderate counsels"], [143, "FIRST STATE LEGISLATURE. 129 OUTLINE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA ciating the engrafting of such a peculiar amend ment into the constitution; but the people were poor and needy and deluded and would not lis ten; their hopes and happiness seemed to depend upon the plighted faith of railway corporators, and on April the 15th, the appointed election day, 25,023 votes were deposited for, while only 6,733 votes were cast against the amendment. CHAPTER XXIV. FIRST STATE LEGISLATUEE STATE RAILWAY BONDS MINNESOTA DURING THE CIVIL WAR-REGIMENTS THE SIOUX OUTBREAK. The transition of Minnesota from a territorial to a state organization occurred at the period when the whole republic was suffering from financial em barrassments. FIRST STATE LEGISLATURE. The election of October, 1857, was carried on with much partisan feeling by democrats and re publicans. The returns from wilderness precincts were unusually large, and in the counting of votes for governor, Alexander Ramsey appeared to have received 17,550, and Henry H. Sibley 17,796 bal lots. Governor Sibley was declared elected by a majority of 246, and duly recognized. The first legislature assembled on the 2d of December, 1857, before the formal admission of Minnesota into the Union, and on the 25th of March, 1858, adjourned until June the 2d, when it again met. The next day Governor Sibley delivered his mes sage. His term of office was arduous. On the 4th of August, 1858, he expressed his determina tion not to deliver any state bonds to the railway companies unless they would give first mortgages, with priority of hen, upon their lands, roads and franchises, in favor of the state. One of the com panies applied for a mandamus from the supreme court of the state, to compel the issue of the bonds without the restrictions demanded by the By an act of congress approved by the president on the 5th of March, 1857, lands had been granted to Minnesota to aid in the construction of railways. During an extra session of the legislature of Min nesota, an act was passed in May, 1857, giving the congressional grant to certain corporations to build railroads. A few months after, it was discovered that the corporators had neither the money nor the credit to begin and complete these internal improve ments. In the winter of 1858 the legislature again listened to the siren voices of the radway corpora tions, until their words to some members seemed like \"apples of gold in pictures of silver,\" and an additional act was passed submitting to the people an amendment to the constitution which provided for the loan of the public credit to the land grant railroad companies to the amount of $5,000,000, upon condition that a certain amount of labor on the roads was performed. Some of the citizens saw in the proposed meas ure \"a cloud no larger than a man's hand,\" which would lead to a terrific storm, and a large public meeting was convened at the capitol in St. Paul, and addressed by ex-Governor Gorman, D. A. Robertson, WdliamR. Marshall and others depre- governor. In November the court, Judge Flandrau dis- sentin\"-, directed the governor to issue state bonds aj sjan as a radway company delivered their first 9"], [144, "OUTLINE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. 130 mortgage bonds, as provided by the amendment to the constitution. But, as was to be expected, bonds sent out under such peculiar circumstances were not sought after by capitalists. Moreover, after over two million dollars in bonds had been issued, not an iron rail had been laid, and only about two hundred and fifty miles of grading had been completed. deposited for Alexander Ramsey as governor, and 17,532 for George L. Becker. Governor Ramsey, in an inaugural delivered on the second of Jan uary, 1860, devoted a large space to the discus sion of the difficulties arising from the issue of the radroad bonds. He said : \"It is extremely desirable to remove as speedily as possible so vex ing a question from our state politics, and not al low it to remain for years to disturb our elections, possibly to divide our people into bond and anti bond parties, and introduce, annually, into our legislative halls an element of discord and possi bly of corruption, all to end just as similar compli cations in other states have ended. The men who will have gradually engrossed the posession of all the bonds, at the cost of a few cents on the dollar, will knock year after year at the door of the legisla ture for their payment in fuU, the press wid be subsidized; the cry of repudiation will be raised; all the ordinary and extraordinary means of pro curing legislation in doubtful cases will be freely resorted to, until finally the bondholders will pile up almost fabulous fortunes. * * * * It is assuredly true that the present time is, of all others, alike for the present bondholder and the people of the state, the very time to arrange, ad just and settle these unfortunate and deplorable railroad and loan complications.\" In his last message Governor Sibley in refer ence to the law in regard to state credit to railways, says: \"I regret to be obliged to state that the measure has proved a failure, and has by no means accomplished what was hoped from it, either in providing means for the issue of a safe currency or of aiding the companies in the completion of the work upon the roads.\" ACT FOR NORMAL SCHOOLS. Notwithstanding the pecuniary complications of the state, during Governor Sibley's administra tion, the legislature did not entirely forget that there were some interests of more importance than radway construction, and on the 2d of August, 1858, largely through the influence of the late John D. Ford, M. D., a public spirited citizen of Winona, an act was passed for the establishment of three training schools for teachers. FIRST STEAMBOAT ON THE RED RIVER OF THE NORTH. In the month of June, 1859 an important route was opened between the Mississippi and the Red River of the North. The then enterprising firm of J. C. Burbank & Co., of St. Paul, having se cured from the Hudson Bay Company the trans portation of their supplies by way of the Missis sippi, in place of the tedious and treacherous routes through Hudson's Bay or Lake Superior, they purchased a little steamboat on the Red River of the North which had bsen built by Anson North rup, and commenced the carrying of freight and passengers by land to Breckenridge and by water to Pembina. The legislature of this year passed a law sub mitting an amendment to the constitution which would prevent the issue of any more radroad bonds. At an election in November, 1860, it was voted on, and reads as follows: \"The credit of the state shall never be given on bonds in aid of any in dividual, association or corporation; nor shall there be any further issue of bonds denominated Min nesota state railroad bonds, under what purports to be an amendment to section ten, of article nine, of the constitution, adopted April 14, 1858, which is hereby expunged from the constitution, saving, excepting, and reserving to the state, nevertheless, all rights, remedies and forfeitures accruing under said amendment.\" This boat had been the first steamboat which moved on the Mississippi above the falls of St. Anthony, to which there is a reference made upon the 121st page. FIRST WHITE PERSON EXECUTED. On page 126 there is a notice of the first In dian hung under the laws of Minnesota. On March 23, 1860 the first white person was executed and attracted considerable attention from the fact, the one who suffered the penalty of the law was a woman. Mr. Northrup, after he purchased the boat, with a large number of wagons carried the boat and machinery from Crow Wing on the Mississippi and on the 8th of April, 1859, reached the Red River not far from the site of Fargo.

Anna, his fourth wife, was tried for the offence, found guilty, and on the 3d of De cember, 1859, sentenced to be hung. The oppo nents to capital punishment secured the passage of an act, by the legislature, to meet her case, but it was vetoed by the governor, as unconstitutional. Two days before the execution, the unhappy wo man asked her spiritual adviser to write to her parents in North Carolina, but not to state the cause of her death. Her scaffold was erected within the square of the Ramsey connty jaU. First regiment was opened at Fort Snelling. More companies having offered than were necessary on the 30th of May Governor Ramsey sent a tele gram to the secretary of war, offering another regiment. THE FIRST REGIMENT. On the 14th of June the First regiment was or dered to Washington, and on the 21st it embarked at St. Paul on the steamboats War Eagle and Northern Belle, with the following officers: Wdlis A. Gorman, Colonel \u2014 Promoted to be brigadier general October 7, 1861, by the advice of Major General Winfield Scott. THIRD STATE LEGISLATURE. The third state legislature assembled on the 8th of January, 1861, and adjourned on the 8th of March. As Minnesota was the first state which received 1,280 acres of land in each township, for school purposes, Governor Ramsey in his annual message occupied several pages, in an able and elaborate argument as to the best methods of guarding and selling the school lands, and of protecting the school fund.

The people of Minnesota had not been as excited as the citizens of the Atlantic states on the ques tion which was discussed before the presidential election of November, 1860, and a majority had calmly declared their preference for Abraham Lin coln, as president of the republic. Edward D. NeiU, Chaplain \u2014 Commissioned July 13, 1862, hospital chaplain U. S. A., resigned in 1864, and appointed by President Lincoln, one of his secretaries. After a few days in Washington, the regi iment was sent to Alexandria, Virginia, where untU the 16th of July it remained. On the morning of that day it began with other troops of Franklin's brigade to movetoward the enemy, and that night encamped in the val ley of Pohick creek, and the next day marched to Sangster's station on the Orange & Alexandria railroad. The third day Centreville was reached. Before daylight on Sunday, the 21st of July, the soldiers of the First regiment rose for a march to battle. About three o'clock in the morning they left camp, and after passing through the hamlet of Centrevdle, halted for General Hunter's column to pass. At daylight the regiment again began to move, and after crossing a bridge on the Warren ton turnpike, turned into the woods, from which at about ten o'clock it emerged into an open coun try, from which could be seen an artillery engage ment on the left between the Union troops under Hunter, and the insurgents commanded by Evans. But the blood of her quiet and intelligent popu lation was stirred on the morning of Aprd 14, 1861, by the intelligence in the daily newspapers that the day before, the insurgents of South Caro lina had bombarded Fort Sumter, and that after a gallant resistance of thirty-four hours General Robert Anderson and the few soldiers of his com mand had evacuated the fort. Governor Ramsey was in Washington at this period, and called upon the president of the repub lic with two other citizens from Minnesota, and was the first of the state governors to tender the services of his fellow citizens. The offer of a regi ment was accepted. The first company raised un der the call of Minnesota was composed of ener getic young men of St. Paul, and its captain was the esteemed William H. Acker, who afterwards fell in battle. On the last Monday of Aprd a camp for the"], [146, "OUTLINE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. 132 lieutenant-colonel of a Mississippi regiment rode out between us, waving his hand for us to stop firing. I rushed up to him and asked 'If he was a secessionist?' He said 'He was a Mississippian.' I presented my bayonet to his breast and com manded him to surrender, which he d_d after some hesitation. I ordered him to dismount, and led him and his horse from the field, in the meantime disarming him of his sword and pistols. I led him off about two miles and placed him in charge of a lieutenant with an escort of cavalry, to be taken to General McDowell. He requested the officer to adow me to accompany him, as he desired my pro tection. The officer assured him that he would be safe in their hands, and he rode off. I retained his pistol, but sent his sword with him.\" In an other letter, dated the 25th of July, Mr. Irvine writes from Washington : \"I have just returned from a visit to Lieutenant-Colonel Boone, who is confined in the old Capitol. I found him in a pleasant room on the third story, surrounded by several southern gentlemen, among whom was Senator Breckenridge. He was glad to see me, and appeared quite wed after the fatigue of the battle of Sunday. There were with me Chaplain Nedl, Captains Wilkin and Colville, and Lieuten ant Coates, who were introduced.\" An hour after this the regiment reached a branch of Bud Run, and, as the men were thirsty, began to fid their empty canteens. Wlnle thus occu pied, and as the St. Paul company under Captain Wdkins was crossing the creek, an order came for Colonel Gorman to hurry up the regiment. The men now moved rapidly through the wood land of a hdlside, stepping over some of the dead of Burnside's command, and hearing the cheers of victory caused by the pressing back of the in surgent troops. At length the regiment, passing Sudley church, reached a clearing in the woods, and halted, whde other troops of Franklin's brig ade passed up the Sudley church road. Next they passed through a narrow strip of woods and occupied the cultivated field from which Evans and Bee of the rebel army had been driven by the troops of Bumside, Sykes and others of Hunter's division. Crossing the Sudley road, Rickett's battery un limbered and began to fire at the enemy, whose batteries were between the Robinson and Henry house on the south side of the Warrenton turn pike, while the First Minnesota passed to the right. After firing about twenty minutes the battery was ordered to go down the Sudley road nearer the enemy, where it was soon disabled. The First Minnesota was soon met by rebel troops advancing under cover of the woods, who supposed the reg iment was a part of the confederate army. The mistake of several regiments of the Union troops in supposing that the rebels were friendly regiments led to confusion and disaster, which was fodowed by panic. Javan B. Irvine, then a private citizen as St. Paul, on a visit to the regiment, now a captain in the United States army, wrote to his wife: \"We had just formed when we were ordered to kneel and fire upon the rebels who were advancing under the cover of the woods. We fired two volleys through the woods, when we were ordered to rally in the woods in our rear, which all did except the first platoon of our own company, which did not hear the order and stood their ground. The rebels soon came out from their shelter between us and their battery. Colonel Gorman mistook them for friends and told the men to cease firing upon them, although they had three secession flags directly in front of their advancing columns. This threw our men into confusion, some declaring they are friends; others that they are enemies. I called to our boys to give it to them, and fired away myself as rapidly as possible. The rebels themselves mistook us for Georgia troops, and waved their hands at us to cease firing. I had just loaded to give them another charge, when a SECOND REGIMENT. The Second Minnesota Regiment which had been organized in July, 1861, left Fort Snelling on the eleventh of October, and proceeding to Louisvdle, was incorporated with the Army of the Ohio.

Early in Aprd the First regiment as a part of Sedgwick's division of the Army of the Potomac arrived near Torktown, Virginia, and was stationed between the Warwick and York rivers, near Wynnes' mid. Dur ing the night of the 30th of May, there was a con tinual discharge of cannon by the enemy, but just before daylight the next day, which was Sunday, it ceased and the pickets cautiously approaching discovered that the rebels had abandoned their works. The next day the regiment was encamped on the field where Cornwallis surrendered to Wash ington. In December, the First Battery of Light Artil lery left the State, and reported for duty at St. Louis, Missouri CAVALRY. During the fad, three companies of cavalry were organized, and proceeded to Benton Barracks, Missouri. Ultimately they were incorporated with the Fifth Iowa Cavalry. MOVEMENTS OF MINNESOTA TROOPS IN 1862. On Sunday the 19th of January, 1862, not ter from Somerset and about forty miles from Danville, Kentucky, about 7 o'clock in the morning, Col. Van Cleve was ordered to meet the enemy, In ten minutes the Second Minnesota regiment was in line of battle. After supporting a battery for some time it continued the march, and pro ceeding half a mde found the enemy behind the fences, and a hand to hand fight of thirty minutes ensued, resulting in the flight of the rebels. Gen. Zollicoffer and Lieut. Peyton, of the insurgents were of the kided. BATTLE OF FAIR OAKS. While Gorman's brigade was encamped at Goodly Hole creek, Hanover county, Virginia, an order came about three o'clock of the afternoon of Saturday, the thirty-first day of May to to cross the Chicahominy and engage in the battle which had been going on for a few hours. In a few minutes the First Minnesota was on the march, by a road which had been cut through the swamp, and crossed the Chicahominy by a rude bridge of logs, with both ends com pletely submerged by the stream swoden by re cent rains, and rising every hour. BATTLE OF PITTSBURG LANDING. On Sunday, the 6th of Aprd occurred the battle of Pittsburg Landing, in Tennessee. Minnesota was there represented by the First Minnesota bat- tery, Captain Emil Munch, which was attached to the division of General Prentiss. Captain Munch was severely wounded. One of the soldiers of his command wrote as follows: \"Sunday morning, just after breakfast, an officer rode up to our Cap- tain's tent and told him to prepare for action. * * * * * *We wheeled into battery and opened upon them. * * * The first time we wheeled one of our drivers was killed; his name was Colby Stinson.

The next day they were in line of battle but not attacked. Upon the field around a country farm house they encamped. BATTLE OF SAVAGE STATION.

Before the close of May the Second, Fourth and Fifth regiments were in conflict with the insur gents, near Corinth, Mississippi. BATTLE OF IUKA. On the 18th of September, Colonel Sanborn, acting as brigade commander in the Third divis ion of the Army of the Mississippi, moved his troops, including the Fourth Minnesota regiment, to a position on the Tuscumbia road, and formed a line of battle. On Monday, between White Oak swamp and Willis' church, the regiment had a skirmish, and Captain Colvdle was sligiitly wounded. Tuesday was the 1st of July, and the regiment was drawn up at the dividing line of Henrico and Charles City county, in sight of James river, and although much exposed to the enemy's batteries, was not actuady engaged. At midnight the order was given to move, and on the morning of the 2d of July they tramped upon the wheat fields at Har rison's Landing, and in a violent rain encamped. BATTLE OF CORINTH. In a few days the contest began at Iuka, culmi nated at Corinth, and the Fourth and Fifth regi ments and First Minnesota battery were engaged. On the 3d of October, about five o'clock, Colo nel Sanborn advanced his troops and received a severe fire from the enemy. Captain Mowers beckoned with his sword during the firing, as if he wished to make an important communication, but before Colonel Sanborn reached his side he fell, having been shot through the head. Before daylight on the 4th of October the Fifth regiment, under command of Colonel L. F. Hubbard, was aroused by the discharge of artillery. Later in the day it became engaged with the enemy, and drove the rebels out of the streets of Corinth. A private writes: \"When we charged on the enemy General Rosecrans asked what little regiment that was, and on being told said 'The Fifth Minnesota had saved the town.'

THIRD REGIMENT HUMILIATED. On the morning of the 13th of July, near Mur freesboro, Ky., the Third regiment was in the pres ence of the enemy. The colonel caUed a council of officers to decide whether they should fight, and the first vote was in the affirmative, but an-"], [149, "THE SIOUX OUTBREAK. 135 other vote being taken it was decided to surrender. Lieutenant-Colonel C. W. Griggs, Captains An drews and Hoyt voted each time to fight. In September the regiment returned to Minnesota, humdiated by the want of good judgment upon the part of their colonel, and was assigned to duty in the Indian country. a messenger who had ridden down from Red wood that day, hearing the news of the terrible occurrences of that morhing. This messenger was Mr. \u2014 Dickinson, who formerly kept a hotel at Henderson, but was living on the reservation at that time. He was in great distress about the safety of his family, and returning at once was killed by the Indians. ' THE SIOUX OUTBREAK. The year 1862 will always be remembered as the period of the uprising of the Sioux, and the slaughter of the unsuspecting inhabitants of the scattered settlements in the Minnesota valley. Elsewhere in this work will be found a detailed ac count of the savage cruelties. In this place we only give the narrative of the events as related by Alexander Ramsey, then the governor of Min nesota. \"When Agent Galbraith received the news, Mr. Shedey states, no one would at first believe it, as such rumors are frequent in the Indian country. Mr. Dickinson assured him of the truth with such earnestness, however, that his account was finally credited and the Renvdle Rangers were at once armed and sent back to Fort Ridgely, where they did good service in protecting the post. \"Agent Galbraith at once prepared the dispatches to me, giving the terrible news and calling for aid. No one could be found who would volunteer to carry the message, and Mr. Shedey offered to come himself. He had great difficulty in getting a horse; but finally secured one, and started for St. Paul, a distance of about ninety mdes, about dark. He had not ridden a horse for some years, and as may be wed supposed by those who have had experience in amateur horseback-riding, suf fered very much from soreness; but rode ad night at as fast a gate as his horse could carry him, spreading the startling news as he went down the Minnesota valley. Reaching St. Paul about 9 A. M., much exhausted he made his way to the capitol, and laid before me his message. The news soon spread through the city and created intense ex citement. \"My surprise may therefore be judged, when, on August 19th, whde busy in my office, Mr. Wm. H. Shelley, one of our citizens who had been at the agency just before the outbreak, came in, dusty and exhausted with a fifteen hours' ride on horse back, bearing dispatches to me of the most start ling character from Agent Galbraith, dated Au gust 18th, stating that the same day the Sioux at the lower agency had risen, murdered the settlers, and were plundering and burning all the build ings in that vicinity. As I believe no particulars regarding the manner in which the news were first conveyed to me has been published, it might be mentioned here. Mr. Shelley had been at Red wood agency, and other places in that vicinity, with the concurrence of the agent, recruiting men for a company, which was afterwards mustered into the Tenth regiment under Captain James O'Gor man, formerly a clerk of Nathan Myrick, Esq., a trader at Redwood, and known as the Renville Ranger3. He (Shelley) left Redwood, he states, on Saturday, August 16th, with forty-five men, bound for Fort Snelling. Everything was quiet there then. It may be wed to note here that one of the supposed causes of the outbreak was the fact that the Indians had been told that the gov ernment needed soldiers very badly, that many white men had been killed, and that ad those in that locality were to be marched south, leaving the state unprotected. Seeing the men leave on Saturday may have strengthened this belief. Stop ping at Fort Ridgely that night, the Renvdle Rangers the next day continued their march, and on Monday afternoon arrived at St. Peter. Gal braith was with them. Here he was overtaken by \"At that time, of course, the full extent and threatening nature of the outbreak could not be determined. It seemed serious, it is true, but in view of the riotous conduct of the Indians at Yellow Medicine a few days before, was deemed a repetition of the emeute, which would be simply local in its character, and easily queded by a smaU force and good management on the part of the authorities at the agency. \"But these hopes, (that the outbreak was a local one) were soon rudely dispelled by the arrival, an hour or two later, of another courier, George C. Whitcomb, of Forest City, bearing the news of the murders at Acton. Mr. Whitcomb had ridden to Chaska or Carver on Monday, and came down from there on the smad steamer Antelope, reaching the city an hour or two after Mr. Shedey. \"It now became evident that the outbreak was"], [150, "OUTLINE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. 136 more general than had at first been credited, and that prompt and vigorous measures would be re quired for its suppression and the protection of the inhabitants on the frontier. I at once pro ceeded to Fort Snelling and consulted with the authorities there (who had already received dis patches from Fort Ridgely) regarding the out break and the best means to be used to meet the the upper Minnesota, with intelligence of the most painful character, regarding the extent and ferocity of the massacre. The messages ad pleaded earnestly for aid, and intimated that without speedy reinforcements or a supply of arms, Fort Ridgely, New Ulm, St. Peter and other points would undoubtedly fall into the hands of the savages, and thousands of persons be butchered The principal danger seemed to be to the settle ments in that region, as they were in the vicinity of the main body of Indians congregated to await the payments. Comers arrived from various points every few hours, and I spent the whole night answering their cads as I could. danger. \"A serious difficulty met us at the outstart. The only troops at Fort Snelling were the raw recruits who had been hastdy gathered for the five regi ments. Most of them were without arms or suit able clothing as yet; some not mustered in or properly officered, and those who had arms had no fixed ammunition of the proper calibre. We were without transportation, quartermaster's or commissary stores, and, in fact, devoid of anything with which to commence a campaign against two or three thousand Indians, wed mounted and armed, with an abundance of ammunition and provisions captured at the agency, and flushed with the easy victories they had just won over the unarmed settlers. Finally four companies were fully organized, armed and uniformed, and late at night were got off on two small steamers, the An telope and Pomeroy, for Shakopee, from which point they would proceed overland. It was ar ranged that others should fodow as fast as they could be got ready. \"Late that night, probably after midnight, Mr. J. Y. Branham, Sr., arrived from Forest City, after a forced ride on horseback of 100 miles, bearing the fodowing message: $ $ * $ $ * * * \"Forest City, Aug. 20, 1862, 6 o'clock a. m. His Excedency, Alexander Ramsey, Governor, etc. \u2014 Sir: In advance of the news from the Min nesota river, the Indians have opened on us in Meeker. It is war! A few propose to make a stand here. Send us, forthwith, some good guns and ammunition to match. Yours truly, A. C. Smith. Seventy-five stands of Springfield rifles and sev eral thousand rounds of bad cartridges were at once issued to George C. Whitcomb, to be used in arming a company which I directed to be raised and enroded to use these arms; and Gen. Sibley gave Mr. Whitcomb a captain's commission for the company. Transportation was furnished him, and the rifles were in Forest City by the morning of the 23d, a portion having been issued to a company at Hutchinson on the way up. A com pany was organized and the arms placed in their hands, and I am glad to say they did good service in defending the towns of Forest City and Hutch inson on more than one occasion, and many of the Indians are known to have been killed with them. The conduct and bravery of the courageous men who guarded those towns, and resisted the assaults of the red savages, are worthy of being commemo rated on the pages of our state history.\" \"This expedition was placed under the manage ment of H. H. Sibley, whose long residence in the country of the Sioux had given him great influ ence with that people, and it was hoped that the chiefs and older men were stid sensible to reason, and that with his diplomatic ability he could bring the powers of these to check the mad and reck less disposition of the \"young men,\" and that if an opportunity for this failed that his knowledge of Indian war and tactics would enable him to overcome them in battle. And I think the result indicated the wisdom of my choice. \u2022T at once telegraphed ad the facts to President Lincoln, and also telegraphed to Governor Solo mon, of Wisconsin, for one hundred thousand cart ridges, of a calibre to fit our rifles, and the requi sition was kindly honored by that patriotic officer, and the ammunition was on its way next day. The governors of Iowa, Hlinois and Michigan were also asked for arms and ammunition. MOVEMENT OF MINNESOTA REGIMENTS 1863. On the 3d of Aprd, 1863, the Fourth regiment was opposite Grand Gulf, Mississippi, and in a few days they entered Port Gibson, and here Col. Sanborn resumed the command of a brigade.

The Second regiment, under Colonel George, on the 19th of September fought at Chicamauga, and in the first day's fight, eight were killed and forty-one wounded. On the 25th of November, Lieutenant-Colonel Bishop in command, it moved against the enemy at Mission Ridge, and of the seven non-commissioned officers in the color guard, six were killed or wounded. FIFTH REGIMENT. The Fifth regiment reached Grand Gulf on the 7th of May and was in the battles of Raymond and Jackson, and at the rear of Vicksburg. The Fourth regiment was also in the vicinity of Chattanooga, but did not suffer any loss. BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG. EVENTS OF 1864. The First regiment reached Gettysburg, Pa., on the 1st of July, and the next morning Han cock's corps, to which it was attached, moved to a ridge, the right resting on Cemetery Hid, the left near Sugar Loaf Mountain. The line of battle was a semi-ellipse, and Gibbon's division, to which the regiment belonged occupied the center of the curve nearest the enemy. On the 2d of July, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, Gen eral Hancock rode up to Colonel Colville, and ordered him to charge upon the advancing foe. The muzzles of the opposing muskets were not far distant and the conflict was terrific. When the sun set Captain Muller and Lieutenant Farrer were killed; Captain Periam mortally wounded; Colonel Colvide, Lieut-Colonel Adams, Major Downie, Adjutant Peller, Lieutenants Sinclair, Demerest, DeGray and Boyd, severely wounded. The Third regiment, which after the Indian ex pedition had been ordered to Little Rock, Arkan sas, on the 30th of March, 1864, had an engage ment near Augusta, at Fitzhugh's Woods. Seven men were killed and sixteen wounded. General C. C. Andrews, in command of the force, had his horse kided by a buflet. FIRST REGIMENT. The First regiment after three year's service was mustered out at Fort Sneding, and on the 28th of April, 1864, held its last dress parade, in the presence of Governor Mdler, who had once been their lieutenant-colonel and commander. In May some of its members re-enlisted as a battal ion, and again joined the Army of the Potomac. SIXTH, SEVENTH, NINTH AND TENTH REGIMENTS. The Sixth regiirent, which had been in the ex pedition against the Sioux, in June, 1864, was as signed to the 16th army corps, as was the Seventh, Ninth and Tenth, and on the 13th of July, near Tupelo, Mississippi, the Seventh, Ninth and Tenth, with portions of the Fifth, were in battle. Dur ing the first day's fight Surgeon Smith, of the Seventh, was fatady wounded through the neck. On the morning of the 14th the battle began in earnest, and the Seventh, under Colonel W. R. Marshall, made a successful charge. Colonel Al exander Wilkin, of the Ninth, was shot, and fed dead from his horse. On the 3d of July, about 10 o'clock in the morn ing, the rebels opened a terrible artillery fire, which lasted imtd 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and then the infantry was suddenly advanced, and there was a fearful conflict, resulting in the defeat of the enemy. The loss on this day was also very severe. Captain Messick, in command of the First regiment, after the wounding of Colvide, and Adams and Downie, was killed. Captain Farred was mortally wounded, and Lieutenants Harmon, Heffelfinger, and May were wounded. Color-Ser geant E. P. Perkins was wounded on the 2d of July. On the 3d of July Corporal Dehn, of the color guard was shot through the hand and the flag staff cut in two. Corporal H. D. O'Brien seized the flag with the broken staff and waving it over his head rushed up to the muzzles of the enemy's muskets and was wounded in the hand, but Corporal W. N. Irvine instantly grasped the THE FOURTH REGIMENT. On the 15th of October the Fourth regiment were engaged near Altoona, Georgia. THE EIGHTH REGIMENT. On the 7th of December the Eighth was in bat tle near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and fourteen were killed and seventy-six wounded."], [152, "OUTLINE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. 138 BATTLE OF NASHVILLE.

Hubbard, of the Fifth, commanding a brigade, after he had been knocked off his horse by a ball, rose, and on foot led his command over the enemy's works. Colonel W. R. Marshall, of the Seventh, in com mand of a brigade, made a gallant charge, and Lieutenant-colonel S. P. Jennison, of the Tenth, one of the first on the enemy's parapet, received a severe wound. STATE AFFAIRS FROM A. D. 1862 to A. D. 1882. In consequence of the Sioux outbreak, Gov ernor Ramsey caded an extra session of the legis lature, which on the 9th of September, 1862, as sembled. As long as Indian hostilities continued, the flow of immigration was checked, and the agricultural interests suffered; but notwithstanding the dis turbed condition of affairs, the St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company laid ten miles of rad, to the Fads of St. Anthony. MINNESOTA TROOPS IN 1865. FIFTH STATE LEGISLATURE. During the fall of 1862 Alexander Ramsey had again been elected governor, and on the 7th of January, 1863, delivered the annual message before the Fifth state legislature. During this session he was elected to fid the vacancy that would take place in the United States senate by the expira tion of the term of Henry M. Rice, who had been a senator from the time that Minnesota was organ ized as a state. After Alexander Ramsey became a senator, the lieutenant-governor, Henry A. Swift, became governor by constitutional provision. In the spring of 1865 the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth regiments were engaged in the siege of Mobile. The Second and Fourth regi ments and First battery were with General Sher man in his wonderful campaign, and the Eighth in the month of March was ordered to North Car olina. The battalion, the remnant of the First, was with the Army of the Potomac untd Lee's sur render. Arrangements were soon perfected for disband ing the Union army, and before the close of the summer all the Minnesota regiments that had been on duty were discharged. GOVERNOR STEPHEN A. MILLER At the election during the fall of 1863, Stephen A. Miller, colonel of the Seventh regiment, was elected governor by a majority of about seven thousand votes, Henry T. Welles being his com petitor, and representative of the democratic party. During Governor Mdler's administration, on the 10th of November, 1865, two Sioux chiefs, Little Six and Medicine Bottle, were hung at Fort Snel ling, for participation in the 1862 massacra LiST OF MINNESOTA REGIMENTS AND TROOPS.

The former was elected by about five thousand majority. In 1867 Governor Marshad was again nominated for the office, and Charles E. Flandrau was the democratic candidate, and he was again elected by about the same major ity as before. GOVERNOR HORACE AUSTIN. Horace Austin, the judge of the Sixth judicial district, was in 1869 the republican candidate for governor, and received 27,238 votes, and George L. Otis, the democratic candidate, 25,401 votes. In 1871 Governor Austin was again nominated,"], [153, "ROCKY MOUNTAIN LOCUST. 139 and received 45,883 votes, while 30,092 ballots were cast for Wintfarop Young, the democratic candidate. The important event of his adminis tration was the veto of an act of the legislature giving the internal improvement, lands to certain railway corporations. zens of Minnesota were excited by a telegraphic announcement that a band of outlaws from Mis souri had, at mid-day, ridden into the town of Northfield, recklessly discharging firearms, and proceeding to the bank, killed the acting cashier in an atte\u00bbpt to secure its funds. Two of the desperadoes were shot in the streets, by firm resi dents, and in a brief period, parties from the neighboring towns were in pursuit of the assassins. After a long and weary search four were sur rounded in a swamp in Watonwan county, and one was killed, and the others captured. Toward the close of Governor Austin's adminis tration, William Seeger, the state treasurer, was im peached for a wrong use of public funds. He plead guilty and was disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust or profit in the state. GOVEBNOB OUSHMAN K. DAVIS. The republicans in the fall of 1873 nominated Cushman K. Davis for governor, who received 40,741 votes, while 35,245 ballots were thrown for the democratic candidate, Ara Barton. At the November term of the fifth district court held at Faribault, the criminals were arraigned, and under an objebtionable statute, by pleading guilty, received an imprisonment for life, instead of the merrited death of the gallows. The summer that he was elected the locust made its appearance in the land, and in certain regions devoured every green thing. One of the first acts of Governor Davis was to relieve the farmers who had suffered from the visitation of locusts. The legislature of 1874 voted relief, and the people of the state voluntarily contributed clothing and provisions. THE EOCKY MOUNTAIN LOCUST. As early as 1874 in some of the counties of Minnesota, the Rocky Mountain locust, of the same genus, but a different species from the Eu rope and Arctic locust, driven eastward by the failure of the succulent grasses of the upper Mis souri valley appeared as a short, stout-legged, d _- vouring army, and in 1875 the myriad of eggs deposited were hatched out, and the insects bom within the state, flew to new camping grounds, to begin their devastations. During the administration of Governor Davis the principle was settled that there was nothing in the charter of a railroad company limiting the power of Minnesota to regulate the charges for freight and travel. In the spring the locust appeared in some coun ties, but by an ingenious contrivance of sheet iron, covered with tar, their numbers were speedily reduced. It was soon discovered that usually but one hatching of eggs took place in the same district, and it was evident that the crop of 1877 would be remunerative. When the national Thanksgiving was observed on the 26th of No vember nearly 40,000,000 bushels of wheat had been garnered, and many who had sown in tears, devoutly thanked Him who had given plenty, and meditated upon the words of the Hebrew Psalm ist, \"He maketh peace within thy borders and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.\" WOMEN ALLOWED TO VOTE FOB SCHOOL OFFICEES. At the election in November, 1875, the people sanctioned the following amendment to the con stitution: \"The legislature may, notwithstanding anything in this article, [Article 7, section 8] pro vide by law that any woman at the age of twenty-one years and upwards, may vote at any election held for the purpose of chosing any officer of schools, or upon any measure relating to schools, and may also provide that any such woman shall be eligible to hold any office solely pertaining to the management of schools.\" GOVEENOB J. S. PILLSBUEY. GOVEBNOE PIIiLSBDET'S SECOND TEEM. John S. Pillsbury, the republican nominee, at the election of November, 1875, received 47,073 for governor while his democratic competitor, D. L. Buell obtained 35,275 votes. Governor Pillsbury in his inaugural message, delivered on the 7th of January, 1876, urged upon the legislature, as his predecessors had done, the importance of provid ing for the payment of the state railroad bonds. At the election in November, 1877, Governor Pillsbury was elected a second time, receiving 59,701, while 39,247 votes were cast for William L. Banning, the nominee of the democratic party. At this election the people voted to adopt two im portant amendments to the constitution. BIENNIAL SESSION OF THE LEGISLATUEE. One provided for a biennial, in place of the an nual session of the legislature, in these words: EAID ON NOBTHFIELD BANK. On the 6th of September, 1876, the quiet citi-"], [154, "OUTLINE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. 140 people at the November election disapproved of the proposition. Against the proposed amendment 45,669 votes were given, and only 26,311 in favor. \"The legislature of the state shad consist of a senate and house of representatives, who shall meet biennially, at the seat of government of the state, at such time as shall be prescribed by law, but no session shad exceed the term of sixty days.\" FIRST BIENNIAL SESSION. The first biennial session of the legislature con vened in January, 1881, and Governor Pillsbury again, in his message of the 6th of January, held up to the view of the legislators the dishonored railroad bonds, and the duty of providing for their settlement. In his argument he said: CHRISTIAN INSTRUCTION EXCLUDED FROM SCHOOLS. The other amendment excludes Christian and other religious instructions from all of the edu cational institutions of Minnesota in these words: \"But in no case, shall the moneys derived as afore said, or any portion thereof, or any public moneys, or property be appropriated or used for the sup port of schools wherein the distinctive doctrines, or creeds or tenets of any particular Christian or other religious sect, are promulgated or taught.\" \"The liability having been voluntardy incurred, whether it was wisely created or not is foreign to the present question. It is certain that the obli gations were fairly given for which consideration was fairly received; and the state having chosen foreclosure as her remedy, and disposed of the property thus acquired unconditionally as her own, the conclusion seems to me irresistible that she assumed the payment of the debt resting upon such property by every principle of law and equity. And, moreover, as the state promptly siezed the radroad property and franchises, ex pressly to indemnify her for payment of the bonds, it is difficult to see what possible justification there can be for her refusal to make that payment.\" IMPEACHMENT OF JUDGE PAGE. The personal unpopularity of Sherman Page, judge of the Tenth judicial district, culminated by the house of representatives of the legislature of 1878, presenting articles, impeaching him, for con duct unbecoming a judge : the senate sitting as a court, examiued the charges, and on the 22d of June, he was ac quitted. GOVERNOR PILLSBURY'S THIRD TERM. The republican party nominated John S. Pills bury for a third term as governor, and at the elec tion in November, 1879, he received 57,471 votes, while 42,444 were given for Edmund Rice, the rep resentative of the democrats. The legislature in March passed an act for the adjustment of these bonds, which being brought before the supreme court of the state was declared void. The court at the same time declared the amendment to the state constitution, which pro hibited the settlement of these bonds, without the assent of a popular vote, to be a violation of the clause in the constitution of the United States of America prohibiting the impairment of the obliga tion of contracts. This decision cleared the way for final action. Governor Pdlsbury called an extra session of the legislature in October, 1881, which accepted the offer of the bondholders, to be satisfied with a partial payment, and made provis ions for cancelling bonds, the existence of which for more than twenty years had been a humiliation to a large majority of the thoughtful and intelli gent citizens of Minnesota, and a blot upon the otherwise fair name of the commonwealth. With a persistence which won the respect of the opponents of the measure, Governor Pillsbury con tinued to advocate the payment of the state rail road bonds. The legislature of 1870 submitted an amendment to the constitution, by which the \"in ternal improvement lands\" were to be sold and the proceeds to be used in cancelling the bonds, by the bondholders agreeing to purchase the lands at a certain sum per acre. The amendment was adopted by a vote of the people, but few of the bondholders accepted the provisions, and it failed to effect the proposed end. The legislature of 1871 passed an act for a commission to make an equitable adjustment of the bonds, but at a special election in May it was rejected. GOVERNOR HUBBARD. The legislature of 1877 passed an act for calling in the railroad bonds, and issueing new bonds, which was submitted to the people at a special election on the 12th of June, and not accepted. Lucius F. Hubbard, who had been colonel of the Fifth Regiment, was nominated by the repub lican party, and elected in November, 1881, by a large majority over the democratic nominee, R. W. Johnson. He entered upon his duties in Jan uary, 1882, about the time of the present chapter going to press. The legislature of 1878 proposed a constitu tional amendment offering the internal improve ment lands in exchange for radroad bonds, and the"], [155, "HISTORY OF STATE INSTITUTIONS. 141 the Penitentiary at Stidwater.

CAPITOL PENITENTIARY UNIVERSITY DEAF AND DUMB INSTITUTION SCHOOL FOB BLIND AND IMBECILES INSANE ASYLUMS STATE REFORM SCHOOL NORMAL SCHOOLS. Among the public buildings of Minnesota, the capitol is entitled to priority of notice. TEMPORARY CAPITOLS. In the absence of a capitol the first legislature of the territory of Minnesota convened on Mon- day, the 3d of September, 1849, at St. Paul, in a log building covered with pine boards painted white, two stories high, which was at the time a public inn, afterward known as the Central House, and kept by Robert Kennedy. It was situated on the high bank of the river. The main portion of the building was used for the library, secretary's office, council chamber and house of representa- tives' hall, while the annex was occupied as the dining-room of the hotel, with rooms for travelers in the story above. Both houses of the legisla- ture met in the dining-hall to listen to the first message of Governor Ramsey. The permanent location of the capital was not settled by the first legislature, and nothing could be done toward the erection of a cajiitol with the $20,000 appropriated by congress, as the perma- nent seat of government had not been designated. William R. Marshall, since governor, at that time a member of tl\u00e6 house ot representatives from St. Anthony, with others, wished that point to be designated as the capital. Twenty years after, in some remarks before the Old Settlers' Association of Hennepin county, Ex- Governor Marshall alluded to this desire. He said: \"The original act [of congress] made St. Paul the temporary capital, but provided that the legislature might determine lh3 permanent capital. A bill was introduced by the St. Paul delegation to fix the permanent capital there. I opposed it, endeavoring to have St. Anthony made the seat of government. We succeeded in defeat- ing the bill which sought to make St. Paul the permanent capital, but we could not get through the bill fixing it at St. Anthony. So the question remained open in regard to the permanent capital until the next session in 1851, when a compromise was effected by which the capitol was to be at St. Paul, the State University at St. Anthony, and The second territorial legislature assembled on the 2d of January, 1871, in a brick budding three stories in height, which stood on Third street in St. Paul, on a portion of the site now occupied by the Metropolitan Hotel, and before the session closed it was enacted that St. Paul should be the permanent capital, and commissioners were ap pointed to expend the congressional appropriation for a capitol. When the Third legislature assembled, in Jan uary, 1852, it was stdl necessary to occupy a hired building known as Goodrich's block, which stood on Third street just below the entrance of the Merchants' Hotel. In 1853, the capitol not being finished, the fourth legislature was obliged to meet in a two-story brick building at the corner of Third and Minnesota streets, and directly in the rear of the wooden edifice where the first legisla ture in 1849 had met. THE CAPITOL. After it was decided, in 1851, that St. Paul was to be the capital of the territory, Charles Bazilla gave the square bounded by Tenth, Eleventh, Wabasha, and Cedar streets for the capitol. Apian was adopted by the building commission ers, and the contract was taken by Joseph Daniels, a builder, who now resides in Washington as a lawyer and claim agent. The budding was of brick, and at first had a front portico, supported by four Ionic columns. It was two stories above the basement, 139 feet long and nearly 54 feet in width, with an extension in the rear 44x52 feet. In July, 1853, it was so far completed as to allow the governor to occupy the executive office. SPEECHES OF EX-PRESIDENT FILLMORE AND GEORGE BANCROFT.

On the 8th of June a large excursion party, under the auspices of the builders of the Chicago & Rock Island railway, arrived at St. Paul from the latter point, in five large steamboats, and among the passengers were some of the most distinguished scholars, statesmen and divines of the republic. At night the popu lation of St. Paul fided the capitol, and the more sedate listened in the senate chamber to the stir ring speeches of Ex-President Fillmore, and the historian, George Bancroft, who had been secre tary of the navy, and minister plenipotentiary to Great Britain, whde at a later period of the night the youthful portion of the throng danced in the reom then used by the supreme court. had not been conceived. Those sentinel walls that look down upon the Mississippi, seen as I beheld them, in their abundant verdure, just when the earliest tinge of the fall gave luxuriance to the forests, made me think how much of taste and genius had been wasted in celebrating the high lands of Scotland, before the civilized man had reached the banks of the Mississippi; and the beautiful Lake Pepin, seen at sunset, when the autumnal green of the hills was lost in the deep blue, and the genial atmosphere reflected the rays of the sun, and the skies above seemed to move down and spread their gorgeous drapery on the scene, was a piece of upholstery, such as none but the hand of nature could have made, and it was but the vestibule of the capitol of the state of Minnesota. ***** ***** * * * Here is the place, the central place where the agriculture of the richest region of North America must pour its tribute. On the east, all along the shore of Lake Superior, and west, stretching in one broad plain, in a belt quite across the continent, is a country where State after State is to arise, and where the productions for the support of humanity, in old and crowded States, must be brought forth. The \"Pioneer\" of the next day thus alludes to the occasion : \" The ball in honor of the guests of the excursion came off, in fine style. At an early hour, the assembly having been called to or der, by the Hon. H. H. Sibley, a welcoming speech was delivered by Governor Gorman, and replies were made by Ex-President Fillmore and the learned historian Bancroft. ****** The dancing then commenced and was kept up till a late hour, when the party broke up, the guests returning to the steamers, and our town's people to their homes, all delighted with the rare enter tainment.\" \"This is then a commanding field, but it is as commanding in regard to the destiny of this coun try and of this continent, as it is, in regard to the commercial future, for power is not permanently to reside on the eastern slope of the Alleghany Mountains, nor in the sea-ports. Sea-ports have always been overran and controlled by the people of the interior, and the power that shall communi cate and express the will of men on this continent is to be located in the Mississippi valley and at the sources of the Mississippi and Saint Lawrence. HON. W. H. SEWARD'S SPEECH. On the 8th of September, 1860, the capitol was visited by Hon. William H. Seward. At mid-day he met by invitation the members of the Histori cal Society in their rooms at the Capitol, and an address of welcome was made by the Rt. Rev. Bishop Anderson, of Rupert's Land, to which he made a brief response. In the afternoon, crowds assembled in the grounds to listen to an expected speech, and every window of the capitol was occupied with eager faces. Standing upon the front steps, he ad dressed the audience in the language of a patriot and a statesman, and among his eloquent utter ances, was the following prediction. \"In our day, studying, perhaps what might seem to others trifling or visionary, I had cast about for the future and ultimate central seat of power of North American people. I had looked at Quebec, New Orleans, Washington, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and San Francisco, and it had been the result of my last conjecture, that the seat of power in North America could be found in the valley of Mexico, and that the glories of the Aztec capital would be surrendered, at its becoming at last the capital of the United States of America, but I have corrected that view.

Michael Doran announced that the building was on fire. All eyes were at once turned in that direction, and the flash of the flames was visible from the top of the gallery, as well as from the hall, which is on a level with the floor of the senate. The panic that ensued had a different effect upon the differ ent persons, and those occupying places nearest the entrance, pushing open the door, and rushing pell mell through the blinding smoke. Two or three ladies happened to be in the vicinity of the doors, and happily escaped uninjured. But the opening of the door produced a draft which drew into the senate chamber clouds of smoke, the fire in the meantime having made its appearance over the center and rear of the gallery. All this occurred so suddenly that senators standing near the re porter's table and the secretary's desk, which were on the opposite side of the chamber from the en trance, stood as if paralyzed, gazing in mute as tonishment at the smoke that passed in through the open doors, at the flames over the gallery, and the rushing crowd that blocked the door- ways. The senate suddenly and formally adjournel. President Gdman, however stood in his place, gavel in hand, and as he rapped his desk, loud and often he yeded: \"Shut that door! Shut that door!\" FLAG PRESENTATION-. In a few months after this speech, Mr. Seward was chosen by President Lincoln, inaugurated March 4, 1861, as secretary of state, and the next great crowd in front of the capitol was collected by the presentation of a flag by the ladies of St. Paul to the First Minnesota regiment which had been raised for the suppression of the slave-holders rebellion. On May the 25th, 1861, the regiment came down from their rendezvous at Fort Sneding, and marched to the capital grounds. The wife of Governor Ramsey, with the flag in hand, appeared on the front steps, surrounded by a committee of ladies, and presenting it to Colonel Gorman, made a brief address in which she said : \" From this capitol, to the most remote frontier cottage, no heart but shall send up a prayer for your safety; no eye but shall follow with affection the flutter ings of your banner, and no one but shall feel pride, when you crown the banner as you wfll crown it, with glory.\" As the State increased in population it was nec essary to alter and enlarge the budding, and in 1873, a wing was added fronting on Exchange street, and the cupola was improved. The legis lature of 1878 provided for the erection of another wing, at an expense of $14,000, fronting on Waba sha street. The building, by successive additions, was in length 204 feet, and in width 150 feet, and the top of the dome was more than 100 feet from the ground. \"The cry was taken up by Colonel Crooks and other senators, and the order was finady obeyed, after which, the smoke clearing away, the senators were enabled to codect their senses and decide what was best to be done. President Gilman, still standing up in his place, calm and collected as if nothing unusual had happened, was encour aging the senators to keep cool. Colonel Crooks was giving orders as if a battle was raging around him. THE OAPITOL IN FLAMES. On the morning of the 1st of March, 1881, it was destroyed by fire. About 9 o'clock in the the evening two gentlemen, who lived opposite, discovered the capitol was on fire, and immedia tely, by the telegraph, an alarm notified the firemen of the city, and the occupants of the capitol. The flames rapidly covered the cupola and licked the flag flying from the staff on top. One of the reporters of the Pioneer Press, who was in the senate chamber at the time, graphically describes the scene within. \"Other senators were giving such advice as oc curred to them, but unfortunately no advice was pertinent except to keep cool and that was all. Some were imp irtuning the secretary and his as sistants to save the records, and General Jennison, his hands full of papers, was waiting a chance to walk out with them. But that chance looked re mote, indeed, for there, locked in the senate cham ber, were at least fifty men walking around, some looking at each other in a dazed sort of a way; others at the windows looking out at the snow-cov ered yard, now dluminated from the flames, that were heard roaring and crackling overhead. He writes: \"The senate was at work on third reading of house bdls; Lieutenant Governor Gil man in his seat, and Secretary Jennison reading something about restraining cattle in Rice county ; the senators were lying back listening carelessly,"], [158, "144 OUTLINE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. From some windows men were yelling to the lim ited crowd below : \"Get some ladders! Send for ladders!\" Other windows were occupied. About this time terror actuady siezed the members, when Senator Buck remarked that the fire was raging overhead, and at the same moment burning brands began to drop through the large ventdators upon the desks and floor beneath. bare wads alone remained of the capitol which for nearly thirty years had been familiar to the law-makers and public men of Minnesota. Steps were immediately taken to remove the debris and build a new capitol, upon the old site. The foundation walls have been laid, and in the course of a year the superstructure will be com pleted. \"Then, for a moment, it seemed as if ad hopes of escape were cut off. ***** But happily the flames having made their way through the dome, a draught was created strong enough to clear the halls of smoke. The dome was almost directly over the entrance of the senate chamber, and burning brands and timbers had fallen down through the glass ceiling in front of the door, rendering escape in that director im possible. THE PENITENTIARY. Before the penitentiary was budt, those charged or convicted of crime were placed in charge of the commandants of Fort Sneding or Ripley, and kept at useful employment under military supervision. At the same time it was decided to erect a capitol at St. Pard,it was also determined that the territorial prison should be budt at or within half a mile of Stdlwater. A small lot was secured in 1851 in what was called the Battle ravine, in consequence of the conflict between the Sioux and Chippeways de- scribed on the 103d page. Within a stone wad was erected offices of the prison, with an annex con- taining six cells. A warden's house was built on the outside of the wall. In 1853, an addition of six cells was made and on the 5th of March, 1853, Ft R. Delano entered upon his duties as warden. His reports to the legislature show that for several years there was little use for the cells. The prison was opened for criminals on the 1st of September,1853,and until January, 1858 there had been received only five convicts, and forty-one county and thirty city prisoners awaiting trial. The use of the prison by the counties and city as a temporary place of confinement led to some misunderstanding between the warden and Wash- ington county, and the grand jury of that county in November, 1857, complained that the warden was careless in discharge of his duties. The jury, among other complaints sent the following ironi- cal statement: \"It was also found in such exami- nation that one Maria Roffin, committed on charge of seding spirituous liquors to the Indians within the territory of the United States escaped in the words of the record, 'by leaving the prison' and it is a matter of astonishment to this grand jury that she so magnanimously consented to leave the penitentiary behind her.\" \"But a small window leading from the cloak room of the senate chamber to the first landing of the main stairway furnished an avenue of escape, and through this little opening every man in the sen ate chamber managed to get out. \"The windows were about ten feet high, but Mr. Michael Doran and several other gentlemen stood at the bottom, and nobly rendered assistance to those who came tumbling out, some headlong, some sideways and some feet foremost. \" As the reporter of the Pioneer-Press came out and landed on his feet, he paused for a moment to survey the scene overhead, where the flames were lashing themselves into fury as they played under neath the dome, aud saw the flag-staff burning, and coals dropping down like fiery hail. \"It took but a few minutes for the senators to get out, after which they assembled on the outside, and they had no sooner gained the street than the ceiling of the senate chamber fell in, and in ten minutes that whole wing was a mass of flames.\" Simdar scenes took place in the hall of the house of representatives. A young lawyer, with a friend, as soon as the fire was noticed, ran into the law library and began to throw books out of the windows, but in a few minutes the density of the smoke and the approach of the flames com pelled them to desist, and a large portion of the library was burned. The portraits of Generals Sherman and Thomas which were hung over the stairway were saved. The books of the Histori cal Society, in the basement, were removed, but were considerably damaged. In three hours the Francis O. J. Smith acted as warden for a brief period after Delano, and then H. N. Setzer. In 1859, the nnmber of cells had increased to sixteen, and among the inmates was a hitherto respectable"], [159, "HISTORY OF STATE INSTITUTIONS. 145 citizen sentenced for fifteen years for robbing a post-office. in my judgment, if a smad loan was effected to erect a budding, and establish one or two profes sorships, and a preparatory department, such loan to be based upon the townships of land appropri ated for the sole use of the University.\" In 1860 John S. Proctor became warden, and after eight years of efficient service, was succeeded by Joshua L. Taylor. By successive additions in 1869 nearly ten acres were enclosed by prison walls, and during this year extensive shops were built. The State in 1870 erected a costly prison at an expense of about $80,000, which, besides a chapel and necessary offices, contained two hun dred and ninety-nine cells. While it was pleasing to locfl pride to have a budding in prospect which could be seen from afar, the friends of education shook their heads, and declared the prospect of borrowing money to build a University building before the common school system was organized was visionary, and would be unsuccessful. The idea, however, con tinued to be agitated, and the Regents at length were authorized by the Legislature of 1856, to issue bonds in the name of the University, under its corporate seal, for fifteen thousand dodars, to be secured by the mortgage of the University budding which had been erected on the new site, and forty thousand dodars more were authorized to be issued by the Legislature of 1858, to be secured by a lien on the lands devoted for a Ter ritorial University. With the aid of these loans a costly and inconvenient stone edifice was con structed, but when finished there was no demand for it, and no means for the payment of interest or professors. A. C. Webber succeeded Taylor as Warden in March, 1870, and the following October, Henry A. Jackman took his place, and continued in office until August, 1874, when the present incumbent, J. A. Reed, was appointed. It has been the policy of the State to hire the convicts to labor for contractors, in workshops within the walls. At present the inmates are largely engaged in the making of agricultural machines for the firm of Seymour, Sabin & Co. THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. The Territorial Legislature of 1851, passed an act establishing the University of Minnesota at or near the Fads of St. Anthony, and memorialized Congress for a grant of lands for the Institution. Soon after, Congress ordered seventy-two sections of land to be selected and reserved for the use of said University. In the fall of 1858, in the hope that the Uni versity might be saved from its desperate condi tion, the Regents elected the Rev. Edward D. Neid as Chancellor. He accepted the position without any salary being pledged, and insisted that a University must necessarily be of slow de velopment, and must succeed, not precede, the common schools, and contended that five years might elapse before anything could be done for a University which would be tangible and visible. He also expressed the belief that in time, with strict watchfulness, the heavy load of debt could be lifted. As the Regents had no funds, Franklin Steele gave the site now the public square, on Second Street in the East Division, opposite the Minnesota Medical College. Mr. Steele and others at their own expense erected a wooden building thereon, for a Preparatory Department, and the Rev. E. W. Merrdl was eng.iged as Principal. At the close of the year 1853, the Regents reported that there was ninety- four students in attendance, but that the site selected being too near the Fads, they had purchased of Joshua L. Taylor and Paul B. George about twenty-five acres, a mde eastward, on the heigth overlooking the Falls of St. Anthony. The Legislature of 1860 abolished the old board of Regents of the Territorial University by pass ing an act for a State University, which had been prepared by the Chancellor, and met the approval of Chancellor Tappan, of Michigan University. Its first section declared \"that the object of the State University established by the Constitution of the State, at or near the Fads of St. Anthony, shall be to provide the best and most efficient means of imparting to the youth of the State an education more advanced than that given in the public schools, and a thorough knowledge of the Governor Gorman, in his message in 1854 to the Legislature said : \"The University of Minne sota exists as yet only in name, but the time has come when a substantial reality may and should be created.\" But the Regents could not find any patent which would compress a myth into reality, for not an acre of the land grant of Congress was available. The Governor in his message therefore added: \"It would not embarrass our resources, ID"], [160, "OUTLINE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. 146 branches of literature, the arts and sciences, with their various applications.\" The increased demand for pine lands, of which the University owned many acres, and the sound discretion of these gentlemen co-operated in pro curing happy results. In two years Governor Marshall, in his message to the legislature, was able to say: \"The very able and successful man agement of the affairs of the institution, under the present board of Regents, relieving it of over one hundred thousand dodars of debt, and saving over thirty thousand acres of land that was at one time supposed to be lost, entitles Messrs. Pillsbury, Merriman, and Nicols to the lasting gratitude of the State.\" This charter also provided for the appointment of five Regents, to be appointed by the Governor, and confirmed by the Senate, in place of the twelve who had before been elected by the Legis lature. The Legislature of 1860 also enacted that the Chancellor should be ex-officio State Superin tendent of Public Instruction. The first meeting of the Regents of the State University was held on the fifth of April, 1860, and steps were taken to secure the then useless edi fice from further ddapidation. The Chancellor urged at this meeting that a large portion of the territorial land grant would be absorbed in pay ment of the moneys used in the erection of a building in advance of the times, and that the only way to secure the existence of a State University was by asking Congress for an addi tional two townships, or seventy-two sections of laud, which he contended could be done under the phraseology of the enabling act, which said: \"That seventy-two sections of land shall be set apart and reserved for the use and support of a State Univer sity to be selected by the Governor of said State,\" etc. The legislature of 1867 appropriated $5,000 for a preparatory and Normal department, and the Regents this year chose as principal of the school, the Rev. W. W. Washburn, a graduate of the Uni versity of Michigan, and Gabriel Campbell, of the same institution, and Ira Moore as assistants. The legislature of 1868 passed an act to reorganize the University, and to establish an Agricultural Col lege therein. Departing from the policy of the University of Michigan, it established what the Regents wished.a department of Elementary instruction. It also pro vided for a Codege of Science, Literature and the Arts; a College of Agriculture and Mechanics with Military Tactics; a college of Law, and a College of Medicine. The Regents requested the Governor to suggest to the authorities that it was not the intention of Congress to turn over the debts and prospectively encumbered lands of an old and badly managed Territorial institution, but to give the State that was to be, a grant for a State University, free from all connection with the Territorial organiza tion. The Governor communicated these views to the authorities at Washington, but it was not till after years of patient waiting that the land was obtained by an act of Congress. The provision of the act of 1860, for the appoint ment of Regents was retained, and the number to be confirmed by the Senate, was increased from five to seven. The new board of Regents was organized in March, 1868. John S. Pillsbury, of St. Anthony, President; O. C. Merriman, of St. Anthony, Sec retary, and John Nicols, of St. Paul, Treasurer. At the breaking out of the civil war in 1861, the Chancedor became Chaplain of the First Regi ment of Minnesota Volunteers, and went to the seat of war, aud the University affairs continued to grow worse, and the University building was a by-word and hissing among the passers by. Dur ing the year 1863, some of the citizens of St. An thony determined to make another effort to extri cate the institution from its difficulties, and the legislature of 1864 passed an act abolishing the board of Regents, and creating three persons sole regents, with power to liquidate the debts of the institution. The Regents under this law were John S. Pillsbury and O. C. Merriman, of St. An thony, and John Nicols, of St. Paul. At a meeting of the Regents in August, 1869, arrangements were made for collegiate work by electing as President and Professor of mathematics William W. Folwed. President Folwed wa3 born in 1835, in Seneca county, New York, and graduated with distinction in 1827, at Hobart College in Geneva, New York. For two years he was a tutor at Hobart, and then went to Europe. Upon his return the civil war was raging, and he entered the 50th New York Volun teers. After the army was disbanded he engaged in business in Ohio, but at the time of his election to the presidency of the University, was Professor of mathematics, astronomy, and German at Ken yon College."], [161, "HISTORY OF STATE INSTITUTIONS. 147 THE FACULTY. tus, and are thoroughly ventilated.

The condition was complied with, but the financial condition of the country and the breaking out of the civil war, with other causes retarded the progress of the Institution for five years.

The campus of the university since it was orig- inally acquired, has been somewhat enlarged, and now consists of about fifty acres in extent, undu- lating in surface, and well wooded with native trees. The buildings are thus far but two in number, the plan of the original building, which in outline was not unlike the insane asylum build- ing at St. Peter, having been changed by the erection in 1876, of a large four-story structure budt of stone aud surmounted by a tower.

The entire budding is four stories above the base ment.\" use of the Institution, which opened on the 9th of September, 1863, with five pupils, which soon in creased to ten. On February 13th, 1864, the State appropriated about forty thousand dollars for the suppert of the Institution, and the directors expended about one thousand dollars in the erection of small additional building, eighteen by twenty feet in dimensions, with a recitation room in the basement. The exterior walls are budt of blue lime stone from this vicinity, and the style Franco Roman esque. Over the center is a graceful cupola, and the top of the same is one hundred and fifty feet above the ground.

The directors the next month elected as Super intendent Jonathan L. Noyes, A. M. On the 7th of September Professor Noyes arrived at Faribault with Miss A. L. Steele as an assistant teacher and Henrietta Watson as matron. The entire cost to the State of ad the improve ments was about $175,000, and the building will accommodate about two hundred pupds. The rooms are lighted by gas from the Faribault Gas Works. NORTH WING OF EDIFICE COMPLETED. INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS. Upon the 17th of March, 1868, the Institution was removed to a wing of the new building upon a site of fifty-two acres beautifully situated upon the brow of the hilis east of Faribault. The edi fice of the French louvre style, and was designed by Monroe Sheire, a St. Paul architect, and cost about fifty-three thousand dollars, and water was introduced from springs in the vicinity. The first shop opened was for making barrels. To this cooper shop has been added a shoe shop, a tador shop and a printing office. MAGAZINE. The pupils established in March, 1876, a little paper called the Gopher. It was printed on a small press, and second-hand type was used. In June, 1877, it was more than doubled in size, and changed its name to \"The Mutes' Com panion.\" Printed with good type, and filled with pleasant articles it stid exists, and adds to the in terest in the institution. WORK SHOPS. In 1869, the Superintendent was cheered by the completion of the first work shop, and soon eight mutes under the direction of a mute foreman be gan to make flour barrels, and in less than a vear had sent out more than one thousand, and in 1873 4,054 barrels were made. EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. In 1863 a law was passed by the legislature re quiring blind chddren to be educate under the su pervision of the Deaf and Dumb Institution. Early in July, 1866, a school for the blind was ojjened in a separate building, erected for the pur pose, under the care of Miss H. N. Tucker. Dur ing the first term there were three pupils. In May, 1868, the blind pupils weae brought into the deaf and dumb institution, but the experiment of in structing these two classes together was not satis factory, and in 1874 the blind were removed to the old Faribault House, which had been fitted up for their accommodation. In 1876 Prof. James J. Dow was made principal of the blind school. SOUTn WING BEGAN. The completed wing was not intended to accom modate more than sixty pupils and soon there was a demand for more room. During the year 1869 the foundation of the south wing was completed, and on the 10th of September 1873 the budding was occupied by boys, the other wing being used for the girls. By the time the building was ready students were waiting to occupy. MAIN BUILDING COMPLETED. In 1879 the design was completed by the finish ing of the centre building. The whole edifice is thus described by the architect, Monroe Sheire: \"The plan of the building is rectangular, and con sists of a central portion one huudred feet north Half a mile south of the Deaf and Dumb Insti tution, a large, new brick building has been erected for the blind, by the side of the residence formerly occupied by Alexander Faribault."], [163, "HISTORY OF STATE INSTITUTIONS. 149 Pennsylvania Institution of the Deaf and Dumb, on Bond Street, Philadelphia, and found instructing deaf mutes was a pleasant occupation.

With wisdom and patience, gentleness and energy, and an unfaltering trust in a superintending Providence, he has there contin ued his work with the approbation of his fellow citizens, and the affection of the pupils of the institution. SCHOOL FOR THE FEEBLE MINDED. From time to time, in his report to the-Legisla ture, Superintendent Noyes alluded to the fact that some children appeared deaf and dumb because of their feeble mental development, and in 1879, the state appropriated $5,000 for a school for imbecile children. The institution was started in July of that year by Dr. Henry M. Knight, now deceased, then Superintendent and founder of the Connecticut school of the same description, who was on a visit to Faribault. He superintended the school until the arrival, in September, of his son, Dr. George H. Knight, who had been trained under his father. For the use of the school the Fairview House was rented, and fourteen feeble children were sent from the Insane Asylum at St. Peter. In eigh teen months the number had increased to twenty five. At the time that he was relieved of the care of the blind and imbecile, the directors entered upon their minutes the following testimonial: The site of the new building for the school is about forty rods south of the Blind School. The dimensions are 41x80 feet, with a tower projection 20x18 feet. It is of limestone, and three stories above the basement, covered with an iron hip-roof, and cost about $26,000. \"Resolved, That upon the retirement of Prof. J. L. Noyes from the superiutendency of the depart ments of the blind and imbecile, the the board of Directors, of the Minnesota Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, and Blind and Idiots, and Imbe ciles, desire to testify to his deep interest in these several departments; his efficient and timely ser vices in this establishment ; and his wise direction of their early progress, untd they have become full-fledged and independent departments of our noble State charitable institutions. SUPERINTENDENT 3. L. NOYES. The growth of the Minnesota institution for the education of the deaf and dumb and the blind, has been so symmetrical, and indicative of one moulding mind, that __ sketch of the institution would be incomplete without some notice of the Superintendent, who has guided it for the last sixteen years. \"For his cordial and courteous co-operation with the directors in their work, and for his timely counsel and advice, never withheld when needed, the board, by this testimonial, render to him their hearty recognition and warm acknowledgement.\" On the 13th of June, 1827, Jonathan Lovejoy Noyes was born in Windham, Rockingham county, New Hampshire. At the age of fourteen years he was sent to Phillips Academy, Andover. Massachu setts, not only only one of the oldest, but among the best schools in the United States. At Andover he had the advantage of the instruction of the thorough Greek scholar, Dr. Samuel H. Taylor, the eminent author, Lyman H. Coleman, D. D., afterwards Professor of Latin in Lafayette Col lege, Pennsylvania, and William H. Wells, whose English grammar has been used in many insti tutions. On the 21st of July, 1862, Professor Noyes mar ried Eliza H. Wadsworth, of Hartford, Connecti cut, a descendent of the Colonel Wadsworth, who in the old colony time, hid the charter of Connecti cut in an oak, which for generations has been known in history as the \"Charter Oak.\" They have but one child, a daughter. INSANE HOSPITAL AT ST. PETER. Untd the year 1866, the insane of Minnesota were sent to the Iowa Asylum for treatment, but in January of that year the Legislature passed an act appointing Wm. R. Marshall, John M. Berry, Thomas Wdson, Charles Mclhath, and S. J. R. McMillan to select a proper place for the Minne- After completing his preparatory studies, in 1848, he entered Yale College, and in four years received the diploma of Bachelor of Arts.

The vicinity of St. Peter was chosen, the citizens presenting to the State two hundred and ten acres one mde south of the city, and on the Minnesota River, directly op posite to Kasota. The remains of eighteen patients were found in the ruins, and seven died in a few days after the fire, in consequence of injuries and exposure. In October, 1866, temporary buildings were erected, and the Trustees elected Samuel E. Shantz, of Utica, N. Y., as the Superintendent. A plan submitted by Samuel Sloan, a Philadelphia architect, consisting of a central building, with sections and wings for the accommodation of at least five hundred patients, in 1867, was adopted, and in 1876 the great structure was completed. Immediate steps were taken by the Governor to repair the damages by the fire. INSANE HOSPITAL AT ROCHESTER. In 1878, the Legislature enacted a law by which an inebriate asylum commenced at Roches ter could be used for an Insane Asylum. With the appropriation, alterations and additions were made, Dr. J. E. Bowers elected Superintendent, and on the 1st of January, 1879, it was opened for patients. It is built of Kasota limestone, the walls lined with brick, and the roof covered with slates. The central budding is four stories in height, sur mounted with a fine cupola, and therein are the chapel and offices. Each wing is three stories high, with nine separate halls. Twenty thonsand dollars have since been appro priated for a wing for female patients. The expenses of construction of the Asylum, with the outbuildings, has been more than half a million of dollars. Dr. Shantz having died, Cyrus K. Bartlett, M. D., of Northampton, Massachu setts, was appointed Superintedent. STATE REFORM SCHOOL. During the year 1865, I. V. D. Heard, Esq., a lawyer of Saint Paul, and at that time City At torney sent a communication to one of the daily papers urging the importance of separating chi'd ren arrested for petty crimes, from the depraved adults found in the station house or county jail, and also called the attention of the City Councd to the need for a Reform School. In January, 1880, in the old temporary build ings and in the Asylum proper there were six hun dred and sixty patients. On the 15th of Novem ber, 1880, about half past eight in the evening, the Superintendent and assistants were shocked by the announcement that the north wing was on fire. It began in the northwest corner of the basement, and is supposed to have been kindled by a patient employed about the kitchen who was not violent. The flames rapidly ascended to the dif ferent stories, through the holes for the hot air pipes, and the openings for the dumb waiters. The next Legislature, in 1866, under the influ ence created by the discussion passed a law creat ing a House of Refuge, and appropriated $5,000 for its use on condition that the city of Saint Paul would give the same amount. In November, 1867, the managers purchased thirty acres with a stone farm house and barn thereon, for $10,000, situated in Rose township, in Saint Anthony near Snelling Avenue, in the west ern suburbs of Saint Paul. The wing at the time contained two hundred and seventy patients, and as they were liberated by their nurses and told to make their escape, ex hibited various emotions. Some clapped their hands with glee, others trembled with fear. Many, barefooted and with bare heads, rushed for the neighboring hills and sat on the cold snow. A few remained inside. One patient was noticed in a window of the third story, with his knees drawn up to his chin, and his face in his hands, a cool and interested looker on, and with an expres sion of cynical contempt for the flames as they ap proached his seat. When a tongue of fire would shoot toward him, he would lower his head, and after it passed would resume his position with more than the indifference of a stoic. At last the brick In 1868 the House of Refuge was ready to re ceive wayward youths, and this year the Legis lature changed the name to the Minnesota State Reform School, and accepted it as a state institu tion. The Rev. J. G. Rihelduffer D. D., who had for years been pastor of one of the Saint Paul Presbyterian churches was elected superintendent In 1869 the main building of light colored brick, 40x60 feet was erected, and occupied in December. In February, 1879, the laundry, a separate building was burned, and an appropriation of the"], [165, "SKETCHES OF PUBLIC MEN. 151 Legislature was made soon after of $15,000 for the rebuilding of the laundry and the erection of a work shop. This shop is 50x100 and three stories high. The boys besides receiving a good English education, are taught to be tailors, tinners, carpenters and gardeners. The sale of bouquets from the green house, of sleds and toys, and of tin ware has been one of the sources of revenue. second Normal School, the Legislature give $5,000 for its support. George M. Gage was elected Principal and on the 1st of September, 1868 the school was opered, It occupied the basement of the Methodist church for a few weeks, and then moved into a room over a store at the corner of Front and Main streets. In Aprd 1870, the State building was first occupied. Doctor Rihelduffer continues as superintendent and by his judicious management has prepared many of the inmates to lead useful and honorable lives, after their discharge from the Institution. Prof. Gage resgned in June, 1872, and his suc cessor was Miss J. A. Sears who remained one year. In July 1873, the Rev. D. C. John was elected principal, and in the spring of 1880, he retired. The present Principal is Professor Edward Sear ing, formerly State Superintendent of Public In struction in Wisconsin, a fine Latin scholar, and editor of an edition of Virgd. STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. By the influence of Lieut. Gov. Holcomb and others the first State Legislature in 1858 passed an Act by which three Normal schools might be erected, but made no proper provision for their support. ST. CLOUD NORMAL SCHOOL. In 1869, the citizens of St. Cloud gave $5,000 for the establishment in that city of the third Normal School, and a budding was fitted up for its use. The legislature in 1869, appropriated $3,000 for current expenses. In 1870, a new build ing was begun, the legislature having appropriated $10,000, and in 1873, $30,000; this building in 1875 was first occupied. In 1875, the Rev. D. L. Kiehle was elected Principal, Prof. Ira Moore, the first Principal having resigned. In 1881, Prof. Kiehle was appointed State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Jerome Aden, late of New York, was elected his successor. WINONA NORMAL SCHOOL. Dr. Ford, a graduate of Dartmouth college, and a respectable physician in Winona, with sev eral residents of the same place secured to the amount of $5,512 subscriptions for the establish ment of a Normal School at that point, and a small appropriation was secured in 1880 from the Legislature. John Ogden, as Ohio, was elected Principal, and in September, 1860, the school was opened in a temporary building. Soon after the civil war be gan the school was suspended, and Mr. Ogden entered the army. In 1864 the Legislature made an appropriation of $3,000, and and William F. Phelps, who had been in charge of the New Jersey Normal School at Trenton, was chosen principal. In 1865 the State appropriated $5,000 annually for the school and the citizens of Winona gave over $20,000 to ward the securing of a site and the erection of a CHAPTER XXVII.

Then he was employed as a copyist in the office of Register of Deeds. For several years he was engaged in such business as would give sup port. Thoughtful, persevering and studious, at the age of eighteen he was able to enter Lafayette College, at Easton, Pennsylvania. After he left college he entered a lawyer's office in Harrisburg, and subsequently attended lectures at the Law School at Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Hon. H. H. Sibley, and with his famdy was his guest for several weeks. He then came to St. Paul, occupied a small housa on Third street near the corner of Robert. On the 1st of June he issued his first proclama mation declaring the organization of the Territorial government, and on the 11th, he issued another creating judicial districts and providing for the election of members of a legislature to assemble in September. To his duties as Governor was added the superintendency of Indian affairs and during the first summer he held frequent confer ences with the Indians, and his first report to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs is stiil valuable for its information relative to the Indian tribes at that time hunting in the vadeys of the Minnesota and the Mississippi. At the age of twenty-four, in 1839, he was ad mitted to the bar of Dauphin county. His execu tive ability was immediately noticed, and the next year he took an active part in the political cam paign, advocating the claims of William H. Harri son, and he was complimented by being made Secretary of the Pennsylvania Presidential Elec tors. After the electoral vote was delivered in Washington, in a few weeks, in January 1841, he was elected chief clerk of the House of Represen tatives of Pennsylvania. Here his ability in dis patching business, and his great discretion made a most favorable impression, and in 1843, the Whigs of Dauphin, Lebanon and Schuylkid counties nominated him, as their candidate for Congress. Popular among the young men of Harrisburg, that city which had hitherto given a democratic majority, voted for the Whig ticket which he represented, and the whole district gave him a majority of votes. At the expiration of his term, in 1845 he was again elected to Congress. During the Governor's term of office he visited the Indians at their vdlages, and made himself familiar with their needs, and in the summer of 1851, made treaties with the Sioux by which the country between the Mississippi Rivers, north of the State of Iowa, was opened for occupation by the whites. His term of office as Governor expired in April, 1853, and in 1855 his fellow townsmen elected him Mayor of St. Paul. In 1857, after Minnesota had adopted a State Constitution, the Republican party nominated Alexander Ramsey for Governor, and the Democrats nominated Henry H. Sibley. The election in October was close and exciting, and Mr. Sibley was at length de clared Governor by a majority of about two hun dred votes. The Republicans were dissatisfied with the result, and contended that more Demo cratic votes were thrown in the Otter Tad Lake region than there were citizens residing in the northern district. Strong in his political preferences, without man ifesting political rancor, and of large perceptive power, he was in 1848 chosen by the Whig party Pensylvania, as the secretary of the Central Com mittee, and he directed the movements in his na tive State, which led to the electoral votes being thrown for General Zachary Taylor for President. In 1859, Mr. Ramsey was again nominated by the Republicans for Governor, and elected by four thousand majority. Before the expiration of his term of office, the Republic was darkened by civil war. Governor Ramsey happened to be in Wash ington when the news of the firing upon Fort Sum ter was received, and was among the first of the State Governors to call upon the President and tender a regiment of volunteers in defense of the Republic. Returning to the State, he dis played energy and wisdom in the organization of regiments. On the 4th of March, 1849, President Taylor took the oath of office, and in less than a month he signed the commission of Alexander Ramsey as Governor of the Territory of Minnesota, which had been created by a law approved the day before his inauguration. By the way of Buffalo, and from thence by lake to Chicago, and from thence to Galena, where he took a steamboat, he traveled to Minnesota and arrived at St. Paul early in the morning of the 27th of May, with his wife, chddren and nurse, but went with the boat up to Mendota, where he was cordially met by the Territorial delegate, In the fall of 1861, he was again nominated and elected as Governor, but before the expiration of this term, on July 10th, 1863, he was elected by"], [167, "SKETCHES OF PUBLIC MEN. 153 the Legislature, United States Senator. Upon en tering the Senate, he was placed on the Commit tees on Naval Affairs, Post-offices, Patents, Pacific Railroad, and Chairman of the Committee on Rev olutionary Pensions and Revolutionary Claims. He was also one of the Committee appointed by Congress to accompany the remains of President Lincoln to Springfield Cemetery, Illinois. to the seat of war, and was present in several bat tles, and when peace was declared returned with the reputation of being a dashing officer. Resuming the practice of law, in the fad of 1848 he was elected to Congress aud served two terms, his last expiring on the 4th of March, 1853, the day when his fellow officer in the Mexican War, Gen. Franklin Pierce took the oath of office as President of the United States. With a commis sion bearing the signature of President Pierce he arrived in Saint Paul, in May, 1853, as the second Territorial Governor of Minnesota. The Legislature of 1869 re-elected him for the term ending in March, 1875. In 1880, he was ap pointed Secretary of War by President Hayes, and for a time also acted as Secretary of the Navy. He was married in 1845 to Anna Earl, daughter of Michael H. Jenks, a member of Congress from Bucks county. He has had three children; his two sons died in early youth; his daughter Marion, the wife of Charles Eliot Furness, resides with her family, with her parents in St. Paul. His term of Governor expired in the spring of 1857, and he was elected a member of the Com mittee to frame a State Constitution, which on the second Monday in July of that year, convened at the Capitol. After the committee adjourned he again entered upon the practice of law but when the news of the firing of Fort Sumter reached Saint Paul he realized that the nation's life was endangered, and that there would be a civil war. He offered his services to Governor Ram sey and when the First Regiment of Minnesota volunteers was organized he was commissioned as Colonel. He entered with ardor upon his work of drilling the raw troops in camp at Fort Sneding, and the privates soon caught his enthusiasm. GOVERNOR GORMAN A. D. 1853 TO A. D. 1857. At the expiration of Governor Ramsey's term of office, President Pierce appointed Wdlis Arnold Gorman as his successor. Gevernor Gorman was the only son of David L. Gorman and born in January, 1866 near Flemingsburgh, Kentucky- After receiving a good academic education he went to Bloomington, Indiana, and in 1836 graduated in the law department of the State University. He imediately entered upon the practice of law with few friends and no money, in Bloomington, and in a year was called upon to defend a man charged with murder, and obtained his acquittal. No officer ever had more pride in his regiment and his soldiers were faithful to his orders. His regiment was the advance regiment of Franklin's Brigade, in Heintzelman's Division at the first Bat tle of Bull Run, and there made a reputation which it increased at every battle, especiady at Gettysburg. Upon the recommendation of Gen eral Winfield Scott who had known him in Mex ico after the battle of Bull Run he was appointed Brigadier General by President Lincoln, That one so young should have engaged in such a case excited the attention of the public, and two years afterwards was elected a member of the Indiana legislature. His popularity was so great that he was re-elected a number of times. When war was declared against Mexico he enlisted as a private in a company of volunteers, which with others at New Albany was mustered into the ser- vice for one year, as the Third Regiment of Indiana Volunteers, with James H. Lane, after- wards U. S. Senator for Kansas, as Colonel, while he was commissioned as Major. It is said that under the orders of General Taylor with a de- tachment of riflemen he opened the battle of Buena Vista. In this engagement his horse was shot and fed into a deep ravine carrying the Major with, him and severely bruising him. After three years of service as Brigadier General he was mustered out and returning to St. Paul resumed his profession. From that time he held several positions under the city government. He died on the afternoon of the 25th of May, 1876. GOVERNOR SIBLEY, A. D. 1858 to A. D. 1860. No one is more intimately asssociated with the development of the Northwest than Henry Hast ings Sibley, the first Governor of Minnesota under the State constitution. By the treaty of Peace of 1783, Great Britain recognizsd the independence of the United States of America, and the land east of the Mississippi, In August, 1847, he returned to Indiana and by his enthusiasm helped to raise the Fourth Regi ment and was elected its Colonel, and went back"], [168, "OUTLINE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. 154 and northwest of the Ohio river was open to set tlement by American citizens. In'a new quarters at the mouth of the Minnesota River. In 1836, he built the first stone residence in Minnesota, without the military reservation, at Mendota, and here he was given to hospitality. The missionary of the cross, and the man of sci ence, the officer of the army, and the tourist from a foreign land, were received with a friendliness that caused them to forget while under his roof that they were strangers in a strange land. In 1786, while Congress was in session in New York City, Dr. Manasseh Cutler, a graduate of Yale, a Puritan divine of a considerable scientific attainments, visited that place, and had frequent conferences with Dane of Massachusetts, and Jef ferson, of Virginia, relative to the colonization of the Ohio valley, and he secured certain provisions in the celebrated \"ordinance of 1787,\" among others, the grant of land in each township for the support of common schools, and also two townships for the use of a University. In 1843, he was married to Sarah J. Steele, the sister of Franklin Steele, at Fort Snelling. On August 6th, 1846, Congress authorized the people of Wisconsin to organize a State govern ment with the St. Croix River as a part of its west ern boundary, thus leaving that portion of Wis consin territory between the St. Croix and Missis sippi Rivers si 11 under the direct supervison of Congress, and the Hon. M. L. Martin, the dele gate of Wisconsin territory in Congress, intro duced a bill to organize the territory of Minnesota including portions of Wisconsin and Iowa. Under the auspiices of Dr. Cutler, and a few others, the first colony, in December, 1787, left Massachusetts, and after a wearisome journey, on April 7, 1788, reached Marietta, at the mouth of the Muskingum River. Among the families of this settlement was the maternal grandfather of Governor Sibley, Colonel Ebenezer Sproat, a gallant officer of Rhode Island, in the war of the Rebellion, and a friend of Kos ciusko. It was not until the 29th of May, 1848, how ever, that Wisconsin territory east of the Saint Croix, was reorganized as a State. On the 30th of October, Mr. Sibley, who was a resident of Iowa territory, was elected delegate to Congress, and after encountering many difficulties, was at length admitted to a seat. Governor Sibley's mother, Sarah Sproat, was ssnt to school to the then celebrated Moravian Seminary at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and subse quently finished her education at Philadelphia. In 1797 she returned to her wilderness home and her father purchased for her pleasure a piano, said to have been the first transjiorted over the Alle ghany Mountains. Soon after this Solomon Sibley, a young lawyer, a native of Sutton, Massachusetts, visited Marietta, and become acquainted and at tached to Sarah Sproat, and in 1802, they were married. The next year Mrs. Sibley went to De troit where her husband had settled, and she com menced housekeeping opposite where the Biddle House is situated in that city. In 1799, Gover nor Sibley's father was a representative from the region now known as Michigan, in the first Ter ritorial Legislature of Northwest, which met at Cincinnati. From 1820 to 1823 he was delegate to Congress from Michigan, and in 1824 he became judge of the supreme court, and in 1836 resigned. Respected by ad, on the 4th of April he died. On the 3d of March, 1849, a law was approved by the President for the organization of Minne sota teritory, and in the fall of that year he was elected the first delegate of the new Territory, as his father had been at an early period elected a delegate from the then new Michigan territory. In 1851, he was elected for another term of two years. In 1857, he was a member of the convention to frame a State constitution for Minnesota, and was elected presiding officer by the democrats. By the same party he was nominated for Governor and elected by a f-m dl m:i ority over the republican candidate, Alexander Rm sey. Minnesota was admitted as a State on the 11th of May, 1858, and on the 28th Governor Sibley delivered his inaugural message. His son, Henry Hastings Sibley, was born in February, 1811, in the city of Detroit. At the age of seventeen, relinquishing the study of law, he became a clerk at Sault St. Marie and then was employed by Robert Stuart, of the American Fur Company at Mackinaw. In 1834 he was placed in charge of the Indian trade above Lake Pepin with After a residence of twenty -eight years at Men dota, in 1862, he became a resident of Saint Paul. At the beginning of the Sioux outbreak, Governor Ramsey appointed him Colonel, and placed him at the head of the forces employed against the In dians. On the 23d of September, 1862, he fought"], [169, "SKETCHES OF PUBLIC MEN. 155 the severe and decisive battle of Wood Lake. In March, 1863, he was confirmed by the senate as Brigadier General, and on the 29th of November, 1865, he was appointed Brevet Major General for efficient and meritorious services. the State Senate, and served during the years 1864 and 1865, and was then appointed by the President, Register of the Land Office at St. Peter. On the 25th of February, 1869 he died. GOVEENOB MILLER\u2014 A. D. 1864 TO A. D. 1866 Since the war he has taken an active interest in every enterprise formed for the advancement of Minnesota, and for the benefit of St. Paul, the city of his residence. His sympathetic nature leads him to open his ear, and also his purse to those in distress, and among his chief mourners when he leaves this world will be the many poor he has be friended, and the faint-hearted who took courage from his words of kindness. His beloved wife, in May, 1869, departed this Use, leaving four chd dren, two daughters and two sons. Stephen A. Miller was the grandson us a Ger man immigrant who about the year 1785 settled in Pennsylvania. His parents were David and Rosanna Mdler, and on the 7th of January, 1816, he was born in what is now Perry county in that State. He was like many of our best citizens, obliged to bear the yoke in his yonth. At one time he was a canal boy and when quite a youth was in charge of a canal boat. Fond of reading he ac quired much information, and of pleasing address he made friends, so that in 1837 he became a for warding and commission merchant in Harrisburg. He always felt an interest in public affairs, and was an efficient speaker at political meetings. In 1849 he was elected Prothonatary of Dauphin county, Pa., and from 1853 to 1855 was editor of the Harrisburg Telegraph; then Governor Pol lock, of Pennsylvania, appointed him Flour In spector for Philadelphia, which office he held untd 1858, when he removed to Minnesota on account of his health, and opened a store at Saint Cloud. GOVERNOR RAMSEY, JANUARY 1860 TO APRIL 1863. Alexander Ramsey, the first Territorial Gov ernor, was elected the second State Governor, as has already been mentioned on another page. Be fore his last term of office expired he was elected United States Senator by the Legislature, and Lieutenant Governor Swift became Governor, for the unexpired term. GOVERNOR SWIFT, APRIL, 1863 TO JANUARY, 1864. Henry A. Swift was the son of a physician, Dr. John Swift, and on the 23d of March, 1823, was born at Ravenna, Ohio. In 1842, he graduated at Western Reserve College, at Hudson, in the same State, and in 1845 was admitted to the practice of the law. During the winter of 1846-7, he was an assistant clerk of the lower house of the Ohio Legislature, and his quiet manner and methodic method of business made a favorable impression. The next year he was elected the Chief Clerk, and continued in office for two years. For two or three years he was Secretary of the Portage Farm- ers' Insurance Company. In April, 1853, he came to St. Paul, and engaged in merchandise and other occupations, and in 1856, became one of the founders of St. Peter. At the election of 1861, he was elected a State Senator for two years. In March, 1863, by the resignation of Lieutenant Governor Donnelly, who had been elected to the United States House of Representatives, he was chosen temporary President of the Senate, and when Governor Ramsey, in Aprd, 1863, left the gubernatorial chair, for a seat in the United States Senate he became the acting Governor. When he ceased to act as Governor, he was again elected to In 1861, Governor Ramsey who had known him in Pennsylvania, appointed him Lieutenant Colo- nel of the First Regiment of Minnesota Volunteers, and was present with his regiment on July 21st of that year in the eventful battle of Bud Run. Gorman in his report of the return of the First Minnesota Regiment on that occasion wrote: \"Be- fore leaving the field, a portion of the right wing, owing to the configuration of the ground and in- tervening woods, became detached, under the com- mand of Lt. Col. Miller whose gallantry was con- spicuous throughout the entire battle, and who contended every inch of the ground with his for ces thrown out as skirmishers in the woods, and succeeded in occupying the original ground on the right, after the repulse of a body of cavalry.\" After this engagement, his friend Simon Cam eron, the Secretary of War, tendered him a posi tion in the regular army which he declined. Although in ill health he continued with the regiment, and was present at Fair Oaks and Mal vern Hid.

In a few weeks, on the 23d of September, 1862, he was in the battle of Wood Lake, and led a charge of five companies of his own regiment, and two of the Sixth, which routed the Sioux, sheltered in a ravine. In 1873, he was elected to the Legislature for a district in the southwestern portion of the State, and in 1876, was a Presidential elector, and bore the electoral vote to Washington. In November, 1863, he became Colonel of the Seventh Regiment. After the campaign in the Indian country the regiment was ordered south, and he gallantly led his command, on the 14th of July, 1864, at the battle near Tupelo, Mississippi. In the conflict before Nashvide, in December, he acted as a Brigade commander, and in April, 1865, he was present at the surrender of Mobile. During the latter years of his life he was em ployed as a land agent by the St. Paul & Sioux City Railroad Company. In 1881 he died. He was married in 1839 to Margaret Funk, and they had three sons, and a daughter who died in early childhood. His son Wesley, a Lieutenant in the United States Army, fell in battle at Gettysburg; his second son was a Commissary of Subsistence, but is now a private; and his youngest son is in the service of a Pennsylvania railroad. In 1865, he was nominated by the Republican party, and elected Governor of Minnesota, and in 1867, he was again nominated and elected. He entered upon his duties as Governor, in January, 1866, and retired in 1870, after four years of service. In 1870, he became vice-president of the bank which was known as the Marine National, which has ceased to exist, and was engaged in other en terprises. GOVERNOR MARSHAL, A. D. 1866 to A. D. 1870. William Rainey Marshall is the son of Joseph Marshall, a farmer and native of Bourbon county, Kentucky, whose wife was Abigail Shaw, of Penn sylvania. He was born on the 17th of October, 1825, in Boone county, Missouri. His boyhood was passed in Quincy, Illinois, and before he at tained to manhood he went to the lead mine dis trict of Wisconsin, and engaged in mining and surveying. In 1874, he was appointed one of the board of Railroad Commissioners, and in 1875, by a change of the law, he was elected Railroad Commissioner, and until January, 1882, discharged its duties. He has always been ready to help in any move ment which would tend to promote the happiness and intelligence of humanity. In September, 1847, when twenty-two years of age, he came to the Fads of St. Croix, and in a few months visited the Falls of St. Anthony, staked out a claim and returned. In the spring of 1848, he was elected to the Wisconsin legislature, but his seat was contested on the ground that he lived beyond the boundaries of the state of Wis consin. In 1849, he again visited the Falls of St. Anthony, perfected his claim, opened a store, and represented that district in the lower house of the first Territorial legislature. In 1851, he came to St. Paul and established an iron and heavy hard ware business. On the 22d of March, 1854, he was married to Abby Langford, of Utica, and has had one child, a son. GOVERNOR AUSTIN A. D. 1870\" TO A. D. 1874. Horace Austin, about the year 1831, was bom in Connecticut. His father was a blacksmith, and for a time he was engaged in the same occupation. Determined to be something in the world, for sev eral years, during the winter, he taught school. He then entered the office of a wed known law firm at Augusta, Maine, and in 1854 came west. For a brief period he had charge of a school at the Falls of Saint Anthony. In 1852, he held the office of County Surveyor, and the next year, with his brother Joseph and In 1856, he became a resident of St. Peter, on"], [171, "SKETCHES OF PUBLIC MEN. 157 the Minnesota River. In 1863, in the expedition against the Sioux Indians, he served as captain in the volunteer cavalry. In 1869, he was elected Governor, and in 1871 he was re-elected. Soon after the termination of his second gubernatorial term, he was appointed Auditor of the United States Treasury at Washington. He has since been a United States Land Officer in Dakota ter ritory, but at present is residing at Fergus Falls, Minnesota. New Hampshire, where his father and grandfather lived. Like the sons of many New Hampshire farmers, he was obliged, at an early age, to work for a sup port. He commenced to learn house painting, but at the age of sixteen was a boy in a country store. When he was twenty-one years of age, he formed a partnership with Walter Harriman, subsequently Governor of New Hampshire. After two years he removed to Concord, and for four years was a tailor and dealer in cloths. In 1853, he came to Michigan, and in 1855, visited Minnesota, and was so pleased that he settled at St. Anthony, now the East Divi sion of the city of Minneapolis, and opened a hardware store. Soon a fire destroyed his store and stock upon which there was no insurance, but by perseverance and hopefulness, he in time re covered from the loss, with the increased confidenco of his fellow men. For six years he was an efficient member of the St. Anthony councd. GOVERNOR DAVIS A. D. 1874 TO A. D. 1876. Cushman Kellog Davis, the son of Horatio N. and Clarissa F. Davis, on the 16th of June, 1838, was born at Henderson, Jefferson county, New York. When he was a babe but a few months old, his father moved to Waukesha, Wisconsin, and opened a farm. At Waukesha, Carroll College had been commenced, and in this institution Gov ernor Davis was partly educated, but in 1857 grad uated at the University of Michigan. In 1863, he was one of three appointed sole Re gents of the University of Minnesota, with power to liquidate a large indebtedness which had been unwisely created in Territorial days. By his carefulness, after two or three years the debt was canceled, and a large partion of the land granted to the University saved. He read law at Waukesha with Alexander Ran dall, who was Governor of Wisconsin, and at a later period Postmaster General of the United States, and in 1859 was admitted to the bar. In 1862, he was commissioned as first beuten ant of the 28th Wisconsin Infantry, and in time became the adjutant general of Brigadier General Willis A. Gorman, ex-Governor of Minnesota, but in 1864, owing to id health he left the army. In 1863, he was elected a State Senator, and served for seven terms. In 1875, he was nomi nated by the republicans and elected Governor; in 1877, he was again elected, and in 1879 for the third time he was chosen, the only person who has served three successive terms as the Governor of Minnesota. Coming to Saint Paul in August, 1864, he en tered upon the practice of his profession, and formed a partnership with ex-Governor Gorman. Gifted with a vigorous mind, a fine voice, and an impressive speaker, he soon took high rank in his profession. By his courage and persistence he succeeded in obtaining the settlement of the radroad bonds which had been issued under the seal of the State, and had for years been ignored, and thus injured the credit of the State. In 1867, he was elected to the lower house of the legislature, and the next year was commisioned United States District Attorney, which position he occupied for five years. In 1872, with his nephew he engaged in the manufacture of flour, and the firm owns several mifls. Lately they have erected a mid in the East Division, one of the best and largest in the world. In 1863, he was nominated by the republicans, and elected Governor. Entering upon the duties of the office in 1874, he served two years. Since his retirement he has had a large legal practice, and is frequently asked to lecture upon literary subjects, always interesting the audience. GOVERNOR HUBBARD, A. D. 1882. Lucius Frederick Hubbard was born on the 26th of January, 1836, at Troy, New York. His father, Charles Frederick, at the time of his death was Sheriff of Rensselaer county.

CHAPTER XXV. ment of education, without ignoring any others arising from the necessity of civd government, and its necessary separation from ecclesiastical control. It must be observed by every reasoning mind, that in the advancement and growth of social elements from savagery, through families and tribes to civilization, and the better forms of government, that in the increasing growth, multi plied industries continually lead so a resistless demand for division of labor, both intellectual and physical. This division must eventually lead, in every form of government, to a separation of what may be termed Church and State; and, of course, in such division, every separate organization must control the elements necessary to sustain its own perpetuity; for otherwise its identity would be lost, and it would cease to have any recognized existence. EDUCATION DEFINITION OF THE WORD STATE EDUCATION CHURCH AND STATE SEPARATED SEPARATION BENEFICIAL STUDIES NOT LIMITED RIVALRY FRIENDLY. As a word, education is of wide application and may convey but an indefinite idea. Broadly, it means to draw out, to lead forth, to train up, to foster, to enable the individual to properly use the faculties, mental or corporal, with which he is endowed; and to use them in a way that wdl ac complish the desired result in all relations and in any department of industry, whether in the domain of intellectual research, or confined to the fields of physical labor. State Education points at once to a definite field of investigation; an organization which is to have extensive direction and control of the subject matter embraced in the terms chosen. It at once excludes the conclusion that any other species of education than secular education is intended. It excludes all other kinds of education not included in this term, without ihe slightest reflection upon parochial, sectarian, denominational, or individual schools; independent or corporate educational or- ganizations. State Education, then, may embrace whatever is required by the State in the due exe- cution of its mission in the protection of individ- ual rights, and the proper advancement of the citizen in material prosperity; in short, whatever may contribute in any way to the honor, dignity, and fair fame of a State; whose sovereign wdl directs, and, to a very great extent, controls the destiny of its subjects. In these divisions of labor, severally organized for different and entirely distinct objects, mutual benefits must result, not from any invasion of the separate rights of the one or the other, by hostde aggression, but by reason of the greatest harmony of elements, and hence greater perfec tion in the labors of each, when limited to the promotion of each separate and peculiar work. In the division, one would be directed towards the temporal, the other toward the spiritual advance ment of man, in any and ad relations which he sustains, not only to his fellow-men, but to the material or immaterial universe. These depart ments of labor are sufficiently broad, although intimately related, to require the best directed energies of each, to properly cultivate their sepa rate fields. And an evidence of the real harmony A reason may be given for this special depart- 11"], [176, "162 STATE EDUCATION. existing between these organizations, the Church and State, relative to the present investigation, is found in the admitted fact, that education, both temporal and spiritual, secular and sectarian, was a principal element of the original organization, and not in conflict with its highest duty, or its most vigorous growth. In the division of the original organization, that department of educa tion, which was only spiritual, was retained with itsnecessrry adjuncts, while that which was only temporal was relegated to a new organization, the temporal organization, the State. The separate elements are still of the same quality, although wielded by two instead of one organization. In this respect, education may be compared to the diamond, which, when broken and subdivided into most minute particles, each separate particle retains not only the form and number of facets, but the brilliancy of the original diamond. So in the case before us, though education has suffered division, and has been appropriated by different organisms, it is nevertheless the same in nature, and retains the same quality and luster of the parent original. reasonable men, it would be quite as easy to deter mine the final triumph of State Education, as to determine the final success of the Cristian faith over Buddhism, or the final triumph of man, in the subjugation of the earth to his control. The decree has gone forth, that man shall subdue the earth; so that, guided by the higher law, Educa tion, under the direction or protection of the State, must prove a final success, for only by organic, scientific, and human instrumentality can the pur pose of the Creator be possibly accomplished on earth. If we have found greater perfection in quality, and better adaptation of methods in the work done by these organizations since the separation, we must conclude that the triumphs of each will be in proportion to the completeness of the separa tion; and that the countries the least shackled by entangling alliances in this regard, must, other things being equal, lead the van, both in the ad vancement of science and in the triumphs of an enlightened faith. And we can by a very slight comparison of the present with the past, deter mine for ourselves, that the scientific curriculum of State schools has been greatly widened and en riched, and its methods better adapted to proposed ends. We can as easily ascertain the important fact that those countries are in advance, where the two great organizations, Church and State, are least in conflict. We know also, that from the nature of the human movement westward, that the best defined conditions of these organizations should be found in the van of this movement. On this continent, then, the highest development of these organizations should be found, at least, when time shall have matured his natural results in the growth and polish of our institutions. Even now, in our infancy, what country on earth can show equal results in either the growth of general knowl edge, the advance of education, or the triumphs of Christian labor at home and abroad ? These are the legitimate fruits of the wonderful energy given to the mind of man in the separate labors of these organizations, on the principle of the division of labor, and consequently better directed energies in every department of industry. This movement is onward, across the continent, and thence around the globe. Its force is irresistable, and all efforts to reunite these happily divided powers, and to return to the culture of past times, and the governments and laws of past ages, must be as unavailing as an attempt to reverse the laws The laws of growth in these separate organiza tions, the Church composed of every creed, and the State in every form of government, must deter mine the extent to which their special education shall be carried. If it shall be determined by the Church, that her teachers, leaders, and followers in any stage of its growth, shall be limited in their acquisitions to the simple elements of knowl edge, reading, writing, and arithmetic, it may be determined that the State should limit education to the same simple elements. But as the Church, conscious of its immature growth, has never restricted her leaders, teachers, or followers, to these simple elements of knowledge; neither has the State seen fit to limit, nor can it ever limit education to any standard short of the extreme limits of its growth, the fullest development \u00abf its resources, and the demands of its citizens. State Education and Church Education are alike in their infancy, and no one is able to prescribe limits to the one or the other. The separation of Church and State, in matters of government only, is yet of very narrow limits, and of very recent origin. And the separation of Church and State, in mat ters of education, has not yet clearly dawned upon the minds of the accredited leaders of these clearly distinct organizations. It is rational, however, to conclude, that among"], [177, "COLONIAL PERIOD. 163 of nature.

By this law \"every town containing fifty house-holders was required to appoint a teach er to teach all children as shall resort to him to write and read;\" and every town containing one hundred families or house-holders was required to \"set up grammar schools, the master thereof being able to instruct youths so far as they may be fitted for the University.\" CHAPTER XXVI. COLONIAL PERIOD \u2014 EDUCATION AT MASSACHUSETTS BAY IN 1836 HARVARD COLLEGE PROVISION FOR COMMON SCHOOLS IN NEW AMSTERDAM IN PENNSLVANIA WILLIAM PENN's GREAT LAW WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE. In New Amsterdam, among the Reformed Prot estant Dutch, the conception of a school system guaranteed and protected by the State, seems to have been entertained by the colonists from Hol land, although circumstances hindered its practi cal development. The same general statement is true of the mixed settlements along the Deleware; Menonites, Catholics, Dutch, and Swedes, in con nection with their churches, established little schools in their early settlements. In 1682, the legislative assembly met at Chester. William Penn made provision for the education of youth of the province, and enacted, that the Governor and pro vincial Council should erect and order all public schools. One section of Penn's Great law,\" is in the words following: State Education is natural in its application. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and every organism after its own kind. Now, in pursuance of this well known law of na ture, that everything created is made after its own order, and its own likeness, it fodows that the new comers on this continent brought with them the germ of national and spiritual life. If we are right in this interpretation of the laws of life re lating to living organisms, we shall expect to find its proper manifestation in the early institutions they created for their own especial purposes imme diately after their arrival here. We look into their history, and we find that by authority of the General Court of Massachusetts, in 1836, sixteen years after the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, Harvard College was established, as an existing identity; that in 1638, it was endowed by John Harvard, and named after him. But the Common School was not overlooked. At a public meeting in Boston, Aprd 13th, 1636, it was \"generally agreed that one Philemon Pormont be entreated to become school master for teaching and nourter ing children.\" \"Be it enacted by authority aforesaid, that all persons within the province and territories thereof, having children, and all the guardians and trustees of orphans, shall cause such to be instructed in reading and writing, so that they may be able to read the scriptures and to write by the time that they attain the age of 12 years, and that they then be taught some useful trade or skdl, that the poor may work to live, and the rich, if they become poor may not want ; of which every county shall take care. And in case such parents, guardians, or overseers shall be found deficient in this respect, every such parent, guardian, or overseer, shall pay for every such child five pounds, except there should appear incapacity of body or understanding to hinder it.\" After the date above, matters of education ran through the civd authority, and is forcibly ex pressed in the acts of 1642 and 1647, passed by the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Col ony. By the act of 1642, the select men of every town are required to have vigdant eye over their brothers and neighbors, to see, first, that none of them shad suffer so much barbarism in any of their families, as not to endeavor to teach by them selves or others, their chddren and apprentices so much learning as shad enable them perfectly to read the English tongue, and knowledge of the Capital laws, under penalty of twenty sbdlings for each offense. By the act of 1647, support of schools was made compulsory, and their blessings And this \"Great law\" of William Penn, of 1682, wid not suffer in comparison with the English stat ute on State Education, passed in 1870, and amend ed in 1877, one hundred and ninety -five years later. In this respect America is two hundred years in advance of Great Britain in State education. But our present limits wdl not allow us to compare American and English State school systems. In 1693, the assembly of Pennsylvania passed a second school law providing for the education of youth in every county. These elementary schools were free for boys and girls.

The legal Government had its origin September 17th, 1787, while the ordinance for the government of the Northwest Territory was passed two months and four days before. Article Third of the renowned ordinance reads as follows: In Virginia, William and Mary College was fa mous even in colonial times. It was supported by direct State aid. In 1726, a tax was levied on liquors for its benefit by the House of Burgesses; in 1759, a tax on peddlers was given this college by law, and from various revenues it was, in 1776, the richest college in North America. \"Religion, morality, and knowledge being nec essary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\" These extracts from the early history of State Education in pre-Colonial and Colonial times give abundant evidence of the nature of the organisms planted in American soil by the Pilgrim Fathers and their successors, as well as other early settlers on our Atlantic coast. The inner life has kept pace with the requirements of the external organi zations, as the body assumes stdl greater and more national proportions. The inner life grew with the exterior demands. What is the territory embraced by this author itative enunciation of the Confederate govern ment ? The extent of the land embraced is almost if not quite equal to the area of the original thir teen colonies. Out of this munificent possession added to the infant American Union, have since been carved, by the authority of the United States government, the princely states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and in part, Min nesota. In this vast region at least, the govern ment has said that education \"shall be forever encouraged.\" Encouraged how and by whom? Encouraged by the Government, by the legal State, by the supreme power of the land. This announcement of governmental aid to State schools was no idle boast, made for the encour agement of a delusive hope, but the enunciation of a great truth, inspired by the spirit of a higher life, now kindled in this new American temple, in which the Creator intended man should worship him according to the dictates of an enlightened conscience, \"where none should molest or make him afraid.\" CHAPTER XXVII. STATE EDUCATION UNDER THE CONFEDERATION ORDINANCE OF 1787 PROVISION FOR EDUCATION AID GIVEN TO STATES IN THE NOTTHWEST TER- RITORY OHIO INDIANA ILLINOIS MICHIGAN WISCONSIN MINNESOTA SECTIONS OF LAND SIXTEEN AND THIRTY-SIX GRANTED IN AID OF ED- UCATION. On the 9th of July, 1787, it was proclaimed to the world, that on the 15th of November, 1778, in the second year of the independence of America, the several colonies of New Hampshire, Massa chusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Providence Planta tions, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Penn sylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia had entered into a Confederate Union. The early Confederation passed away, but the spirit that animated the organism was immortal, and immediately manifested itself in the new Gov ernment, under our present constitution. On the 17th of September, 1787, two months and four days from the date of the ordinance erecting the Northwest Territory was adopted, the new Con stitution was inaugurated. The first State gov ernment erected in the new territory was the State of Ohio, in 1802. The enabling act, passed by Congress on this accession of the first new State, a part of the new acquisition, contains this substantial evidence that State aid was faithfully remembered and readdy offered to the cause of education : This Confederate Union, thus organized as a Government, was able to receive grants of land and to hold the same for such purposes as it saw proper. To the new government cessions were made by several of the States, from 1781 to 1802, of which the Virginia grant was the most im portant. The Confederate Government, on the 13th of July, 1787, and within less than four years after the reception of the Virginia Land Grant, known as the Northwest Territory, passed the ever mem orable ordinance of 1787. This was the first real Sec. 3 : \"That the following proposition be and the same is hereby offered to the convention of the eastern States of said territory, when formed, for"], [179, "AID TO STATES IN THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. 165 their free acceptance or rejection, which, if ac cepted by the convention, shall be obligatory upon the United States : lost nothing of its fervor in the grant made to the New Northwest. When the Territory of Minne sota was organized, Hon. Stephen A. Douglas, then a Senator in Congress from the State of Hlinois, nobly advocated \" claims of Minnesota to an increased amount of urovernment aid for the support of schools, extending from the Common school to the University. By Mr. Douglas' very able, disinterested, and generous assistance and sup port in Congress, aided by Hon. H. M. Rice, then Delegate from Minnesota, our enabling act was made stdl more liberal in relation to State Educa tion, than that of any State or Territory yet ad mitted or organized, in the amount of lands granted to schools generally. \"That section number sixteen, in every town ship, and where such section has been sold, granted or disposed of, other lands equivalent thereto, and most contiguous to the same, shad be granted to the inhabitants of such township for the use of schools.\" The proposition of course was duly accepted by the vote of the people, in the adoption of their constitution prior to their admission to the Union, and on March 3d, 1803, Congress granted to Ohio, in addition to section sixteen, an additional grant of one complete township for the purpose of establishing any higher institutions of learning. This was the beginning of substantial national recognition of State aid to schools by grants of land out of the national domain; but the Govern ment aid did not end in this first effort. The next State, Indiana, admitted in 1816, was granted the same section, number sixteen, in each town ship; and in addition thereto, two townships of land were expressly granted for a seminary of learning. In the admission of Illinois, in 1818, the section numbered sixteen, in each township, and two entire townships in addition thereto, for a seminary of learning, and the title thereto vested in the legislature. In the admission of Michi gan, in 1836, the same section sixteen, and seventy two sections in addition thereto, were set apart to said State for the purpose of State University. In the admission of Wisconsin, in 1848, the same provision was made as was made to the other States previously formed out of the new territory. This was the commencement. Section eighteen of the enabling act, passed on the 3d of March, 1849, is as follows: \"And be it further enacted, That when the lands in said Territory shall be surveyed under the direction of the Government of the United States, preparatory to bringing the same into market, sections numbered sixteen and thirty- six in each township in said Territory shall be, and the same are hereby reserved for the purpose of being applied to schools in said Territory, and in the States and Territories hereafter to be created out of the same.\" As the additions to the family of States increase westward, the national domain is still more freely contributed to the use of schools; and the charac ter of the education demanded by the people made more and more definite. In 1851, whde Oregon and Minnesota were yet territories of the United States, Congress passed the following act: \"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of America, in Congress assem bled: That the Governors and legislative assem blies of the Territories of Oregon and Minnesota, be, and they are hereby authorized to make such laws and needful regulations as they shall deem most expedient to protect from injury and waste, sections numbered sixteen and thirty-six in said Territories reserved in each township for the sup port of schools therein. These five States completed the list of States which could exist in the territory northwest of the Ohio River. Minnesota, the next State, in part lying east of the Mississippi, and in part west, takes its territory from two different sources; that east of the Father of Waters, from Virginia, which was embraced in the Northwest Territory, and that lying west of the same, from \"the Louisiana Purchase,\" bought of France by treaty of April 30, 1803, including also the territory west of the Mississippi which Napoleon had previously ac quired from Spain. The greater portion of Min nesota, therefore, lies outside the first territorial acquisition of the Government of the United States; and yet the living spirit that inspired the early grants, out of the first acquisition, had (2) \"And be it further enacted, That the Sec retary of the Interior be, and he is hereby author ized and directed to set a) art and reserve from sale, out of any of the public lands within the Territory of Minnesota to which the Indian tribe has been or may be extinguished, and not other wise appropriated, a quantity of land not exceed ing two entire townships, for the use and support"], [180, "166 STATE EDUCATION. of a University in said Territory, and for no other purpose whatsoever, to be located by legal sub divisions of not less than one entire section.\" [Approved February 19, 1851.] priated to each State (except States in rebelhon), a quantity equal to thirty thousand acres for each senator and representative in Congress to which the States are respectively entitled by the appor tionment under the census of 1860.\" Section four of said act is in substance as fol lows: \"That all moneys derived from the sale of these lands directly or indirectly shall be invested in stocks yielding not less than five per cent.upon the par value of such stocks. That the money so in vested shad constitute a perpetual fund, the capital of which shad remain forever undiminished, and the interest thereof shall be inviolably appropriated by each State winch may claim the benefit of the act to the endowment, support, and maintenance of at least one college, where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such man ner as the legislatures of the States may respect ively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life. CHAPTER XXVIII. STATE EDUCATION IN MINNESOTA CONSTITUTIONAL MEASURES LEGISLATION BOARD OF REGENTS THE HEAD OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM HIGHER EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL BOARD UNIVERSITY GRANT AID OF CONGRESS IN 1862 RESULTS VALUE OF SCHOOLHOUSES SCHOOLS AIDED BY A GRANT OF $400 EACH. When Minnesota was prepared by her popula tion for application to Congress for admission as a State, Congress, in an act authorizing her to form a State government, makes the fodowing pro vision for schools : (1) \"That sections numbered sixteen and thirty -six in every township of public land in said State, and where either of said sections, or any part thereof, has been sold or otherwise dis posed of, other lands equivalent thereto, and as contiguous as may be, shad be granted to said State for the use of schools. Section five, second clause of said act, provides \"That no portion of said fund, nor the interest thereon, shall be applied, directly or indirectly, under any pretense whatever, to the purchase, erection, preservation, or repairs of any building or buildings.\" (2) \"That seventy-two sections of land shall be set apart and reserved for the use and support of a State University to be selected by the Gov ernor of said State, subject to the approval of the commissioner at the general land office, and be appropriated and applied in such manner as the legislature of said State may prescribe for the purpose aforesaid, but for no other purpose.\" [Passed February 26, 1857.] Section five, third clause, \"That any State which may take and claim the benefit of the pro visions of this act shad provide within five years, at least no less than one College, as described in the fourth section of this act, or the grant to such State shall cease; and the said State shad be bound to pay the United States the amount re ceived of any lands previously sold.\" But that there might be no misapprehension that the American Government not only had the inclination to aid in the proper education of the citizens, but that in cases requiring direct control, the government would not hesitate to exercise its authority, in matters of education as wed as in any and ad other questions affecting its sover eignty. To this end, on the second of July, 1862, Congress passed the \"act donating public lands to the several States and Territories which may pro vide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts.\" Section five, fourth clause, \"An annual report shad be made regarding the progress of each col lege, recording any improvements and experiments made, with their costs and results, and such other matters, including State, industrial, and economi cal statistics, as may be supposed useful; one copy of which shad be transmitted by mail free, by each, to all the other colleges which may be en dowed under the provisions of this act, and also one copy to the Secretary of the Interior.\" \"Be it enacted, &c, that there be granted to the several States for the purposes hereinafter mentioned, an amount of public land to be appro- Under this act Minnesota is entitled to select 150,000 acres to aid in teaching the branches in the act named in the State University, making"], [181, "AID OF CONGRESS IN 1862. 167 the endowment fund of the Government to the state of Minnesota for educational purposes as follows : people who have the destinies of the Western Hemisphere in their hands. That the external organism of the system capable of accomplishing this heavy task, and of carrying forward this re sponsible duty rests with the people themselves, and is as extensive as the government they have estabdshed for the protection of their rights and the growth of their physical industries, and the free development of their intedectual powers. The people, organized as a Nation, in assuming this duty, have in advance, proclaimed to the world, that \"Redgion, Morality, and Knowledge\" are alike essential \"to good government.\" And in organizing a government free from sectarian con trol or adiance, America made an advance hitherto unknown, both in its temporal and spiritual power ; for hitherto the work of the one had hindered the others, and the labors and unities of the two were inconsistent with the proper functions of either. The triumph, therefore, of either, for the control of both, was certain ruin, whde separation of each, the one from the other, was the true life of both. Such a victory, therefore, was never before known on earth, as the entire separa tion, and yet, the friendly rivalry of Church and State, first inaugurated in the free States of America. This idea was crystalized and at once stamped on the fore-front of the Nation's hfe in the aphorism, \"Religion, morality, and knowledge are alike essential to good government.\" And the deduction from this national aphorism, necessarily follows: \"That schools and the means of educa tion, should forever be encouraged.\" We assume, then, without further illustration drawn from the acts of the Nation, that the means of education have not and wid not be withheld. We have seen two great acquisitions, the Northwest Terri tory, and the Louisiana Purchase, parceled out in greater and greater profusion for educational uses, till the climax is reached in the Mississippi Vadey, the future great center of national power. At the head of this vadey sits as regnant queen, the state of Minnesota, endowed with the means of education unsurpassed by any of her compeers in the sisterhood of States. Let us now inquire, as pertinent to this discussion, 1. For common schools, in acres 3,000,000 2. For State University, four townships 208,360 Total apportionment 3,208,360 All these lands have not been selected. Under the agricultural college grant, only 94,439 acres have been selected, and only 72,708 acres under the two University grants, leaving only 167,147 acres realized for university purposes, out of the 208,360, a possible loss of 41,203 acres. The permanent school fund derived from the national domain by the state of Minnesota, at a reasonable estimate of the value of the lands se cured out of those granted to her, cannot vary far from the results below, considering the prices already obtained: 1. Common school lands in acres, 3,000,000, valued at $18,000,000 2. University grants, in all, m acres, 223,000, valued at 1,115,000 Amount in acres, 3,223,000 $19,115,000 Out of this permanent school fund may be real- ized an annual fund, when lands are ad sold : 1. For common schools $1,000,000 2. University instruction 60,000 These several grants, ample as they seem to be, are, however, not a tithe of the means required from the State itself for the free education of the chddren of the State. We shad see further on what the State has already done in her free school system. Minnesota, a State first distinguished by an ex- tra grant of Government land, has something to unite it to great national interest. Its position in the sisterhood of States gives it a prominence that none other can occupy. A State lying on both sides of the great Father of waters, in a conti- nental valley midway between two vast oceans en circling the Western Hemisphere, with a soil of superior fertility, a climate unequaded for health, and bright with skies the most inspiring, such a State, it may be said, must ever hold a prominent position in the Great American Union. In the acts of the early settlements on the At- WHAT HAS MINNESOTA DONE FOR STATE EDUCATION ? The answer is in part made up from her con stitution, and the laws enacted in pursuance thereof: First, then, article VIII. of her consti tution, reads thus: lantic coast, in the Colonial Government and the National Congress, we have the evidence of a de termined intention \"that schools and the means of education shad forever be encouraged\" by the"], [182, "STATE EDUCATION. 168 advance of the establishment of a State Govern ment, \"that the proceeds of the land that may hereafter be granted by the United States to the Territory for the support of the University, shall be and remain a perpetual fund to be called \"The University Fund,\" \"the interest of which shad be appropriated to the support of a University, and no sectarian instruction shall be allowed in such, University!\" This organization of the Universiiy was confirmed by the State Constitution, and the congressional land grants severady passed to that corporation, and the use of the funds arising therefrom were subjected to the restrictions named. So that both the common school and University were dedicated to State School purposes, and ex pressly excluded from sectarian control or secta rian instruction. Section 1. The stability of a republican form of government depending mainly upon the intel dgence of the people, it shad be the duty of the Legislature to estabhsh a general and uniform system of public schools. Section 2. The proceeds of such lands as are, or hereafter may be granted by the United States for the use of schools in each township in this State, shad remain a perpetual school fund to the State. * * * * The principal of all funds arising from sales or other disposition of lands or other property, granted or entrusted to this State, shall forever be preserved inviolate aud undimin ished; and the income arising from the lease or sale of said school land shall be distributed to the different townships throughout the State, in pro portion to the number of scholars in each town ship between the ages of five and twenty-one years; and shall be faithfully applied to the spe cific object of the original grant or appropriation.\" In this respect the State organization corres ponds with the demands of the general Govern ment; and has organized the school system reach ing from the common school to the University, so that it may be said, the-State student may, if he chooses, in the State of Minnesota, pass from grade to grade, through common school, high school, and State University free of charge for tuition. Without referring specially to the pro gressive legislative enactments, the united system may be referred to as made up of units of differ ent orders, and successively in its ascending grades, governed by separate boards, rising in the scale of importance, from the local trustee, direc tors, and treasurer, in the common school, to the higher board of education, of six members in the independent school district, and more or less than that number in districts and large cities under special charter, until we reach the climax in the dignified Board of Regents; a board created by law and known as the Regents of the State Uni versity. This honorable body consists of seven men nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the senate of the State legislature, each holding his office for three years; and besides these there are three ex-officio members consisting of the President of the State University, the Superin tendent of Public Instruction, and the Governor of the State. This body of ten men are in reality the legal head of the State University, and indi rectly the effective head of the State School Sys tem of Minnesota, and are themselves subject only to the control of the State Legislature. These various officers, throughout this series, are severally trustees of legal duties which cannot be Section 3. The Legislature shall make such provision by taxation or otherwise, as, with the income arising from the school fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of public schools in each township in the State. But in no case shall the moneys derived as aforesaid, or any portion thereof, or any public moneys or property, be appropriated or used for the support of schools wherein the distinctive doc trines, creeds, or tenets of any particular Christian or other redglous sect are promulgated or taught.\" THE UNIVERSITY. \"Section 4.

The State Constitution is in full harmony with the National Government in the distinctive outlines laid down in the extracts above made. And the Territorial and State Governments, within these limits, have consecutively appropriated by legis lation, sufficient to carry forward the State School System. In the Territorial act, establishing the University, the people of the State announced in"], [183, "MINNESOTA STATE SYSTEM. 169 delegated. They fad under the legal maxim \" that a trustee cannot make a trustee.\" These are the legal bodies to whom the several series of employes and servitors owe obedience. These various trustees determine the course of study and the rules of transfer from grade to grade untd the last grade is reached at the head of the State system, or the scholar has perhaps completed a post-graduate course in a polytechnic school, inaugurated by the State for greater perfection, it may be in chemistry, agriculture, the mechanic arts, or other specialty, required by the State or national government. head of the State system, having the same relation to the High School as the High School has to the Common School. There was no longer any reason why the same rule should not apply in the trans fer from the High School to the University, that applied in the transfer from the Common School to the High School, and to this conclusion the people of the State have already fully arrived. The rules of the board of Regents of the State Univers ity now adow students, with the Principal's cer tificate of qualification, to enter the Freshman class, on examination in sub-Freshman studies only. But even this is not satisfactory to the friends of the State School system. They demand, for High School graduates, an entrance into the University, when the grade below is passed, on the examina tion of the school below for graduation therein. If, on the one hand, the High Schools of the State, under the law for the encouragement of higher education, are required to prepare students so that they shall be qualified to enter some one of the classes of the University, on the other hand the University should be required to admit the stu dents thus qualified without further examination. The rule should work in either direction. The rights of students under the law are as sacred, and should be as inalienable, as the rights of teachers or faculties in State institutions. The day of un limited, irresponsible discretion, a relic of abso lute autocracy, a despotic power, has no place in systems of free schools under constitutional and statutary dmitations,and these presidents and facul ties who continue to exercise this power in the ab sence of right, should be reminded by Boards of Regents at the head of American State systems, that their resignation would be acceptable. They belong to an antiquated system, outgrown by the age in which we live. This system, let it be understood, differs from ad private, practical, denominational, or sectarian schools. The State organism and all the sectarian elements of the church are in this department of labor entirely distinct. The State protects and encourages, but does not control either the schools or the faith of the church. The church supports and approves, but does not yield its tenets or its creed to the curriculum of the schools of the State. The State and the Church are in this respect, en tirely distinct and different organizations. State Education, however, and the education of the ad herents of the church are in harmony throughout a great portion of the State curriculum. Indeed there seems to be no reason why the greater por tion of denominational teaching so far as the same is in harmony with the schools of the State, should not be relegated to the State, that the church throughout all its sectarian element might be the better able to direct its energies and economize its benevolence in the cultivation of its own fields of chosen labor. But, however this may be, and wherever these two organizations choose to divide their labors, they are stdl harmonious even in their rivalry. The spirit of the people of our State was fully intimated in the legislature of 1881, in the House Bid, introduced as an amendment to the law of 1878-79, for the encouragement of higher educa tion, but finally laid aside for the law then in force, slightly amended, and quite in harmony with the House Bill. Sections two and five al luded to, read as f odows : The organism as a State system has, in Minne sota, so matured that through all the grades to the University, the steps are defined and the gradients passed without any conflict of authority. The only check to the regular order of ascending grades was first met in the State University. These schools, in older countries, had at one time, an independ ent position, and in their origin had their own scholars cf all grades, from the preparatory depart ment to the Senior Class in tne finished course; but in our State system, when the common schools became graded, and the High School had grown up as a part of the organism of a completed sys tem, the Univeraity naturady took its place at the \"Any pubdc, graded or high school in any city or incorporrted vidage or township organized into a district under the so-called township sys tem, which shad have regular classes and courses of study, articulating with some course of study, optional or required, in the State University, and"], [184, "STATE EDUCATION. 170 school dfe. And no legislation framed on any other theory of educational promotion in republi can States can stand against this American con sciousness of equality existing between all the members of the body pohtic. In this conscious ness is embraced the inalienable rights of the child or the youth to an education free in all our public schools. In Minnesota it is guaranteed in the constitution that the legislature shall make such provisions, by taxation or otherwise, as with the income arising from the school fund, wdl secure a thorough and efficient system of public schools in each township in the State.\" Who shall say that the people have no right to secure such thorough and efficient system, even should that \"thorough and efficient system\" extend to direct taxation for a course extending to graduation from a Univer sity ? Should such a course exceed the constitu tional limitation of a thorough and efficient sys tem of pubiic schools ? shall raise annuady for the expense of said school double the amount of State aid allowed by this act, and shall admit students of either sex into the higher classes thereof from any part of the State, without charge for tuition, shall receive State aid as specified in section four of this act.

The people, through the medium of the law making power, have given on three several occa sions, in 1878, 1879 and 1881, an intimation of the scope and measuring of our State constitution on educational extension to higher education than the common school. In the first section of the act of 1881, the legislature created a High School Board, consisting of the Governor of the State, Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the President of the University of Minnesota, who are charged with certain duties and granted certain powers contained in the act. And this High School Board are required to grant State aid to the amount of $400 during the school year to any public graded school, in any city or incorporated village, or township organized into a district which shad give preparatory instruction, extending to and articulating with the University course in some one of its classes, and shall admit sudents of either sex, from any part of the State, without charge for tuition. Provided only that non-resi dent pupils shall be qualified to enter some one of the organized classes of such graded or high school. To carry out this act, giving State aid directly out of the State treasury to a course of education reach ing upward to the common school through the high school to the University, the legislature appropriated the entire sum of $20,000. In this manner we have the interpretation of the people of Minnesota as to the meaning of \"a thorough THE RELATED SYSTEM. We have now seen the position of the Univer sity in our system of Public Schools. In its po sition only at the head of the series it differs from the grades below. The rights of the scholar fol low him throughout the series. When he has completed and received the certificate or diploma in the prescribed course in the High School, ar ticulating with any course, optional or required, in the University, he has the same right, uncon ditioned, to pass to the higher class in that course, as he had to pass on examination, from one class to the other in any of the grades below. So it fol lows, that the University faculty or teacher who assumes the right to reject, condition, or re-exam ine such student, would exercise an abuse of power, unwarranted in law, arbitrary in spirit, and not republican in character. This rule is better and better understood in all State Universities, as free State educational organisms are more crystal ized into forms, analogous to our State and na tional governments.

The States receiving said lands are required, in their codeges or uni versities, to \"teach such branches of learning as are related to Agriculture and the Mechanic arts, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, in such manner as the Legislatures of the States may re spectively prescribe, in order to promote the lib eral and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life.\" 550.28, which was paid out by the State more than was derived from the government endow ment fund. And it is not at all likely that the endowment fund, generous as it is, wdl ever pro duce an amount equal to the cost of instruction. The ratio of the increase of scholars, it is believed, wdl always be in advance of the endowment fund. The cost of instruction cannot fall much below an average, for all grades of scholars, of eight dol lars per annum to each pnpd. Our present 180,000 scholars enrolled would, at this rate, re quire $1,440,000, and in ten years, and long be fore the sale of the school lands of the State shall have been made, this 180.000 will have increased a hundred per cent., amounting to 360.000 scholars. These, at $8.00 per scholar for tuition, would equal $2,880,000 per annum, while the interest from the school fund in the same time cannot exceed $2,000,000, even should the land average the price of $6.00 per acre, and the interest realized be always equal to 6 per cent. And the Legislature of Minnesota has already established in its University, optional or required courses of study fully meeting the limitations in the congressional act of 1862. In its elementary department, it has three courses, known as clas sical, scientific, and modern. In the College of Science, Literature, and the Arts, the courses of study are an extension of those of the elementary departments, and lead directly to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bach elor of Literature. In the College of Mechanic Arts the several courses of studies are principady limited to Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engi neering, and Architecture. In the College of Ag riculture are: (1) The regular University course, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Agriculture. (2) The Elementary course, in part coinciding with the Scientific course of the Elementary De partment. (3) A Farmer's Lecture course. (4) Three special courses for the year 1880-81. Law and Medicine have not yet been opened in the State University for want of means to carry for ward these departments, now so much needed. SOME OF THE RESULTS. In these infant steps taken by our State, we can discern the tendency of our organism towards a completed State system, as an element of a still wider union embracing the nation. To know what is yet to be done in this direction we must know what has already been done. We have, in the twenty years of our State history, built 3,693 school houses, varying in cost from $400 to $90, 000; total value of all, $3,156,210; three Normal Schoool buildings at a cost of (1872) $215,231.52; a State University at an expenditure for buddings alone of $70,000, and an allowance by a late act of the Legislature of an additional $100,000, in three yearly appropriations, for additional build ings to be erected, in all $170,000, adowed by the State for the University. Add these to the cost of common school structures, and we have al ready expended in school buddings over $4,800, 000 for the simple purpose of housing the infant organism, our common school system here planted. We have seen a movement in cities like St. Paul. Minneapolis, Stillwater, and Winona, towards the local organization of a completed system of home schools, carrying instruction free to the University course, with a total enrollment of 13,500 scholars and 265 teachers, dady seated in buildings, all in the modern style of school architecture, and school furniture, costing to these cities the sum of Our State constitution has therefore been prac tically interpreted by the people, by a test that cannot be misconstrued. They have fortified their opinion by the payment of the necessary tax to insure the success of a thorough and efficient system of public schools throughout the State. This proof of the people's interest in these schools appears in the amounts paid for expenses and instruction. From the school fund the State of Minnesota received, in 1879, the fud sum of $232,187.43. The State paid out, that same year the sum of $394,737.71. The difference is $162,-"], [186, "STATE EDUCATION 172 $850,000 for buddings, and for instruction the sum of $118,000 annually. CHAPTER XXIX.

VISION OF LABOR THE GREATEST CAUSE OF GROWTH LOCAL TAXATION IN DIFFERENT STATES STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM KNOWS NO SECT IGNORANCE IN- HERITED, THE COMMON FOE OF MANKIND \u2014 THE NATURAL AND NATIONAL RIGHTS OF PUPILS. The organic elements that regularly combine to form governments, are similar to those organic ele ments that combine to form systems of mental cul ture. The primitive type of government is the famdy. This is the lowest organic form. If no improvement is ever made upon this primitive ele ment, by other combinations of an artificial nature. human governments would never rise higher than the family. If society is to advance, this organ ism widens into the clan, and in like manner the clan into the village, and the village into the more dignified province, and the province into the State. Ad these artificial conditions above the family are the evidences of growth in pursuance of the laws of artificial life. In like manner the growth of intellectual organisms proceeds from the family instruction to the common school. Here the arti ficial organism would cease to advance, and would remain stationary, as the clan in the organism of government, unless the common school should pass on to the wider and stid higher unit of a graded system reaching upward to the high school. Now this was the condition of the com mon school in America during the Colonial state, and even down to the national organization. Soon after this period, the intellectual life of the nation began to be aroused, and within the last fifty years, the State common school has culminated in the higher organism of the high school, and it is of very recent date that the high school has reached up to and articulated in any State with the State University. On this continent, both Gov ernment and State schools started into life, freed from the domination of institutions grown effete from age and loss of vital energy. Here, both en tered into wider combinations, reaching higher results than the ages of the past. And yet, in ed ucational organization we are far below the stand ard of perfection we shall attain in the rapidly advancing future. Not until our system of edu cation has attained a national character as com plete in its related articulation as the civil organ ization of towns, counties, and States in the national Union, can our educational institutions do the These forty-two State aid schools have paid in all for buddings and furniture the gross sum of $642,700; some of these buildings are superior in ad that constitutes superiority in school archi tecture. The Rochester buildings and grounds cost the sum of $90,000. Several others, such as the Austin, Owatonna, Faribault, Hastings, Red Wing, Rushford, St. Cloud, and St. Peter school houses, exceed in value the sum of $25,000; and others of these buildings are estimated at $6,000, $8,000, $10,000, and $15,000. In ad they have an enrollment of scholars in attendance on classes graded up to the University course, numbering 13,000, under 301 teachers, at an annual salary amounting in all to $123,569, and having in their A, B, C, D classes 1,704 scholars, of whom 126 were prepared to enter the sub-freshman class of the State University in 1880, and the number en tering these grades in the year 1879-80 was 934, of whom 400 were non-residents of the districts. And in all these forty-two home schools of the people, the fitting schools of the State University, one uniform course of study, articulating with some course in the University, was observed. As many other courses as the local boards desired were also carried on in these schools. This, in short, is a part of what we have done."], [187, "DIVISION OF LABOR A CAUSE OF GROWTH. 173 work required of this age. And in Minnesota, one of the leading states in connected school organic relations, we have, as yet, some 4,000 common school districts, with an enrollment of some 100, 000 scholars of different ages, from five to twenty one years; no higher in the scale than the com mon school, prior to the first high school on the American continent. These chaotic elements, out side of the system of graded schools now aided by the State, must be reduced to the same organ ized graded system as those that now articulate in their course with the State University. by the growth of years, it puts forth its infant branches and leaflets, suited to its immature but maturing nature; finady it gives evidence of stal wart powers, and now its widespreading top tow ers aloft among its compeers rearing its head high among the loftiest denizens of the woods. In like manner is the growth of the maturing State school organism. In the common school, the foundation is laid for the rising structure, but here is no branches, no fruitage. It seems in its early in fancy to put forth no branches, but is simply tak ing hold of the elements below on which its inner life and growth depends. As the system rises, the underlying laws of hfe come forth in the prin ciples of invention, manufacturing, engraving, and designing, enriching every branch of intellectual and professional industry, and beautifying every field of human culture. These varied results are all in the law of growth in the organism of State schools carried on above the common schools to the University course. The higher the course the more beneficial the results to the industries of the world, whether those industries are intellectual or purely physical, cater only to the demands of wealth, or tend to subserve the modest demands of the humblest citizen. Our complete organization as a State system for educational purposes, equal to the demands of the State, and required by the spirit of the age, will not be consummated until our four thousand school districts shall reap the full benefits of a graded system reaching to the high school course, articu lating with some course in the State University, and a course in common with every other high school in the State. The system thus organized might be required to report to the Board of Re gents, as the legal head of the organization, of the State School system, not only the numerical sta tistics, but the number and standing of the classes in each of the high schools in the several studies of the uniform course, established by the Board of Regents, under the direction of the State Legisla ture. To this system must finally belong the cer tificate of standing and graduation, entitling the holder to enter the designated class in any grade of the State schools, named therein, whether High School or University. But this system is not and can never be a skeleton merely, made up of life less materials, as an anatomical specimen in the office of the student of the practice of the healing art. Within this organism there must preside the living teacher, bringing into this organic struc ture, not the debris of the effete systems of the past, not the mental exuvia of dwarfed intellectual powers of this or any former age, but the teacher inspired by nature to feel and appreciate her meth ods, and ever moved by her divine afflatus. The only criticism that can reach the question now under consideration, is whether the graded organization tends to produce the results to which we have referred. The law relating to the division of labor has especially operated in the graded sys tem of State schools. Under its operation,it is claim ed, by good judges, that eight years of school life, from five to twenty-one, has been saved to the pupils of the present generation, over those of the ungraded schools ante-dating the last fifty years. By the operation of this law, in one generation, the saving of time, on the enrollments of State schools in the graded systems of the northern States of the American Union, would be enormous. For the State of Minnesota alone, on the enroll ment of 180,000, the aggregate years of time saved would exceed a mddon ! The time saved on the enrodment of the schools of the different States, under the operation of this law would exceed over twenty mdlion years! Every living organism has its own laws of growth; and the one we have under consideration may in its most important feature be compared to the growth of the forest tree. In its earlier years the forest tree strikes its roots deep into the earth and matures its growing rootlets, the support of its future trunk, to stand against the storms and winds to which it is at all times exposed. When fullv rooted in the ground, with a trunk matured To the division of labor is due the wonderful facility with which modern business associations have laid their hands upon every branch of indus trial pursuits, and bestowed upon the world the comforts of hfe. Introduced into our system of education it produces results as astonishing as the"], [188, "174 STATE EDUCATION. advent of the spinning Jenny in the manufacture of cloth. As the raw material from the cotton field of the planter, passing, by gradation, through the unskilled hands of the ordinary laborer to the more perfect process of improved machinery, secure additional value in a constantly increasing ratio; so the graded system of intellectual cul ture, from the Primary to the High School, and thence to the University, adds increased lustre and value to the mental development, in a ratio commensurate with the increased skdl of the mem tal operator. than similar instruction can be had in ungraded schools of any character whatever. In this re spect the State system is without a rival. It has the power to introduce such changes as may meet all the demands of the State and all the claims of the learner. The State school knows no sect, no party, no privileged class, and no special favorites; the high, the low, the rich, and the poor, the home and foreign-born, black or white, are all equal at this altar. The child of the ruler and the ruled are here equal. The son of the Governor, the wood sawyer, and the hod-carrier, here meet on one level, and alike contend for ranks, and alike expect the honors due to superior merit, the reward of intedectual culture. But, aside from the republi can character of the State school system, the sys tem is a State necessity. Without the required State culture, under its control, the State must cease to exist as an organism for the promotion of human happiness, or the protection of human rights, and its people, though once cultured and refined, must certainly return to barbarism and savage life. There can be no compromise in the warfare agrinst inherited ignorance. Under ad governments the statute of limitations closes over the subject at twenty-one years; so that during the minority of the race, must this warfare be waged by the government without truce. No peace can ever be proclaimed in this war, untd the child shall inherit the matured wisdom, instead of the primal ignorance of the ancestor. The law of growth in State schools was clearly announced by Horace Mann, when he applied to this system the laV governing hydraulics, that no stream could rise above its fountain. The com mon school could not produce a scholarship above its own curriculum. The high school was a grade above, and as important in the State system as the elevated fountain head of the living stream. This law of growth makes the system at once the most natural, the most economical, and certainly the most popular. These several elements might be illustrated, but the reader can easily imagine them at his leisure. As to the last, however, suffer an illustration. In Minnesota, for the school year ending August 21, 1880, according to the report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, there were enrolled, one hundred and eighty thousand, two hundred and fifty-eight scholars in the State schools, whde all others embracing kindergartens, private schools, parochial schools, of all sects and all denominations, had an attendance at the same time of only two thousand four hundred and twenty-eight; and to meet all possible omissions, if we adow double this number, there is less than three per cent, of the enrollment in the State school. This ratio will be found to hold good, at least, throughout all the Northern States of the American Union. These State schools then, are not unpopular in comparison with the schools of a private and opposite character. Nor is it owing altogether to the important fact, that State schools are free, that they are more popular than schools of an opposite character; for these State schools are a tax upon the property of the people, and yet a tax most cheerfully borne, in consequence of their superior excellence and importance. The State School system, in our government, is from the necessity of the case, National. No State can enforce its systam beyond the hmits of its own territory. And unless the nation enforce its own uniform system, the conflict between jurisdic tions could never be determined. No homogen eous system could ever be enforced. As the graded system of State schools has now reached the period in its history which corresponds to the colonial history of the national organization, it must here fail, as did the colonial system of gov ernment, to fully meet the demands of the people. And what was it, let us consider, that led the peo ple in the organization of the national govern ment, \"to form a more perfect union?\" Had it then become necessary to take this step, that \"justice\" might be established, domestic tranqufl ity insured, the common defense made more effi cient, the general welfare promoted, and the bless ings of liberty better secured to themselves and The State school, if not already, can be so graded, that each scholar can have the advantage of superior special instruction far better adapted to the studies through which he desires to pass,"], [189, "CONCLUSION. 175 their posterity, that the fathers of the gov ernment should think it necessary to form a more perfect union.\" Why the necessity of a more perfect union? Were our fathers in fear of a domestic or foreign foe, that had man ifested his power in their immediate presence, threatening to jeopardize or destroy their do mestic tranquility? Was this foe an hereditary enemy, who might at long intervals of time invade their territory, and endanger the liberties of this people? And for this reason did they demand a more perfect union ? And does not this reason now exist in still greater force for the formation of a still more perfect union in our system of State schools? Our fathers were moved by the most natural of all reasons, by this law of self-defense. They were attacked by a power too great to be successfully resisted in their colonial or unorgan ixed state. The tear of a destruction of the sev eral colonies without a more perfect union drove them to this alternative. It was union and the hope of freedom, against disunion and the fear of death, that cemented the national government. And this was an external organism, the temple in which the spirit of freedom should preside, and in which her worshippers should enjoy not only do mestic but national tranquility. Now, should it be manifest to the world, that the soul and spirit, the very life of this temple, erected to freedom, is similarly threatened, should not be the same cause that operated in the erection of the temple itself, operate in the protection of its sacred fires, it3 soul and spirit ? It would seem to require no admoni tion to move a nation in the direction of its high est hopes, the protection of its inner life. against their hereditary foe, this enemy to our government, has kept among us a standing army of iditerates, who can neither read nor write, but are armed with the ballot, more powerful than the sword, ready to strike the most deadly blow at human freedom; he has cut off and almost entirely destroyed our trade between states of the same government; has imposed a tax upon us without our consent, most grievous to be borne; he has quite abolished the free system of United States laws in several of our States; he has established in many sections, arbitrary tribunals, excluding the subject from the right of trial by jury, and en larged the powers of his despotic rule, endanger ing the lives of peaceable citizens; he has aliena ted government of one section, by declaring the inhabitants, aliens and enemies to his supposed hereditary right; he has excited domestic insur rections amongst us; he has endeavored to destroy the peace and harmony of our people by bringing his despotic ignorance of our constitutions into con flict with the freedom and purity of our elections; he has raised up advocates to his cause who have openly declared that our system of State Educa tion, on which our government rests, is a failure*; he has spared no age, no sex, no portion of our country, but has, with his ignominious minions, afflicted the North and the South, the East and the West, the rich and the poor, the black and the white; an enemy alike to the people of every sec tion of the government, from Maine to California, from Minnesota to Louisiana. Such an inexorable enemy to government and the domestic tranquility of all good citizens deserves the opprobrium due only to the Prince of Darkness, against whom eter nal war should be waged; and for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protec tion of Divine Providence, we should, as did our fathers, mutually pledge to each other, as citizens as the free States of America, our lives, our for tunes, and our sacred honor. And what is this enemy, and where is the power able to destroy both the temple and the spirit of freedom ? And why should State Education take upon itself any advanced position other than its present independent organic elements? In the face of what enemy should it now be claimed we should attempt to change front, and \"form a more perfect union to insure domestic tranquility, and promote the general welfare,\" to the end that we may the better secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity ? That potent foe to our free institutions, to which we are now brought face to face, is human ignorance, the natural hereditary foe to every form of enlightened free government. This hereditary enemy is now home steaded upon our sod.

But this pretended grant has been examined by our government and entirely ignored as a pure invention of parties in interest, after Carver's death, to profit by his Indian ser vice in Minnesota. LOUIS hennepin's visit TO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI IN 1680 \u2014 CAPTAIN JONATHAN CARVER VISITS THE COUNTRY IN 1766 THE NAMES OF THE TRIBES TREATIES WITH SIOUX INDIANS FROM 1812 TO 1859 THEIR RESERVATIONS CIVILIZATION EF- FORTS SETTLEMENTS OF THE WHITES CONTIGU- OUS TO THE RESERVATIONS. The first authentic knowledge of the country upon the waters of the Upper Mississippi and its tributaries, was given to the world by Louis Hen nepin, a native of France. In 1680 he visited the Fads of St. Anthony, and gave them the name of his patron saint, the name they still bear. There can be no doubt that these same Indians, known to Captain Carver as the Naudowessies, in 1767, were the same who inhabited the country upon the Upper Mississippi and its tributaries when the treaty of Traverse des Sioux was made, in 1851, between the United States and the Sisse ton and Wapaton bands of Dakota or Sioux Indi ans. The name Sioux is said to have been bestowed upon these tribes by the French; and that it is a corruption of the last sydable of their more an cient name, which in the peculiar gutteral of the Dakota tongue, has the sound of the last sydable of the old name Naudowess.'es, Sioux. Hennepin found the country occupied by wild tribes of Indians, by whom he and his compan ions were detained as prisoners, but kindly treated, and finally released. In 1766, this same country was again visited by a white man, this time by Jonathan Carver, a British subject, and an officer in the British army. Jonathan Carver spent some three years among different tribes of Indians in the Upper Missis sippi country. He knew the Sioux or Dakota Indians as the Naudowessies, who were then occu pying the country along the Mississippi, from Iowa to the Fads of St. Anthony, and along the Minnesota river, then caded St. Peter's, from its source to its mouth at Mendota. To the north of these tribes the country was then occupied by the Ojibwas, commonly called Chippewas, the heredi tary enemies of the Sioux. The tribes inhabiting the Territory of Minne sota at the date of the massacre, 1862, were the following: Medawakontons (or Vidage of the Spirit Lake); Wapatons (or Vidage of the Leaves); Sissetons (or Vdlage of the Marsh); and Wapakutas (or Leaf Shooters). Ad these were Sioux Indians, connected intimately with other wild bands scattered over a vast region of country, including Dakota Territory, and the country west of the Missouri, even to the base of the Rocky Mountains. Over all this vast region roamed these wild bands of Dakotas, a powerful and warlike nation, holding by their tenure the country north to the British Possessions. Carver found these Indian nations at war, and by his commanding influence finady succeeded in making peace between them. As a reward for his good offices in this regard, it is claimed that two chiefs of the Naudowessies, acting for their nation, at a council held with Carver, at the great cave, (177) 12"], [192, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 178 The Sissetons had a hereditary chief, Ta-tanka Mazin, or Standing Buffalo; and at the date of the massacre his father, \"Star Face,\" or the \"Or phan,\" was yet alive, but superannuated, and ad the duties of the chief were vested in the son, Standing Buffalo, who remained friendly to the whites and took no part in the terrible massacre on our border in 1862. the Hawk and Yellow Medicine rivers. This last reservation had also a width of ten miles on each side of the Minnesota river. The Indians west of the Missouri, in referring to those of their nation east of the river, called them Isanties, which seems to have been applied to them from the fact that, at some remote period, they, had lived at Isantamde, or \"Knife Lake,\" one of the Mdle Lacs, in Minnesota. The four tribes named, the Medawakontons, Wa patons, Sissetons and Wapakutas, comprised the entire \"annuity Sioux\" of Minnesota; and in 1862 these tribes numbered about six thousand and two hundred persons. All these Indians had from time to time, from the 19 th day of July, 1815, to the date of the massacre of 1862, received pres ents from the Government, by virtue of various treaties of amity and friendship between us and their accredited chiefs and heads of tribes. These Indian treaties inaugurated and contrib uted greatly to strengthen a custom of granting, to the pretended owners of lands occupied for purposes of hunting the wild game thereon, and living upon the natural products thereof, a con sideration for the cession of their lands to the Government of the United States. This custom culminated in a vast annuity fund, in the aggre gate to over three million dollars, owing to these tribes, before named, in Minnesota. This annuity system was one of the causes of the massacre of 1862. Soon after the close of the last war with Great Britain, on the first day of June, 1816, a treaty was concluded at St. Louis between the United States and the chiefs and warriors representing eight bands of the Sioux, composing the three tribes then called the \"Sioux of the Leaf,\" the \"Sioux of the Broad Leaf,\" and the \"Sioux who Shoot in the Pine Tops,\" by the terms of which these tribes confirmed to the United States all cessions or grants of lands previously made by them to the British, French, or Spanish govern ments, within the limits of the United States or its Territories. For these cessions no annuities were paid, for the reason that they were mere con firmations of grants made by them to powers from whom we had acquired the territory. Indian Life. \u2014 Before the whites came in con tact with the natives, they dressed in the skins o' animals which they kdled for food, such as the buffalo, wolf, elk, deer, beaver, otter, as wed as the small fur-bearing animals, which they trapped on lakes and streams. In later years, as the settle ments of the white race approached their borders, they exchanged these peltries and furs for blankets, cloths, and other articles of necessity or ornament. The Sioux of the plains, those who inhabited the Coteau and beyond, and, indeed, some of the Sisseton tribes, dress in skins to this day. Even among those who are now called \"civilized,\" the style of costume is often unique. It is no picture of the imagination to portray to the reader a \"stal wart Indian\" in breech-cloth and leggins, with a calico shirt, all \"fluttering in the wind,\" and hig head surmounted with a stove-pipe hat of most surprising altitude, carrying in his hand a pipe of exquisite workmanship, on a stem not unlike a cane, sported as an ornament by some city dandy. His appearance is somewhat varied, as the seasons come and go. He may be seen in summer or in winter dressed in a heavy cloth coat of coarse fab ric, often turned inside out with ad his civilized and savage toggery, from head to foot, in the most bewildering juxtaposition. On beholding him, the dullest imagination cannot refrain from the poetic exclamtion of Alexander Pope, From the treaty of St. Louis, in 1816, to the treaty ratified by the United States Senate in 1859, these tribes had remained friendly to the whites, and had by treaty stipulations parted with all the lands to which they claimed title in Iowa; ad on the east side of the Mississippi river, and all on the Minnesota river, in Minnesota Territory, ex cept certain reservations. One of these reserva tions lay upon both sides of the Minnesota, ten miles on either side of that stream, from Hawk river on the north, and Yellow Medicine river on the south side, thence westerly to the head of Big Stone Lake and Lake Traverse, a distance of about one hundred miles. Another of these reser vations commenced at Little Rock river on the east, and a line running due south from opposite its mouth, and extending up the river westerly to the easterly line of the first-named reservation, at \"Lo! the poor Indian, whose untutored mind!\""], [193, "EFFORTS OF CIVILIZATION. 179 Efforts to Civilize these Annuity Indians. \u2014 The treaty of 1858, \"made at Washington, elabo rated a scheme for the civilization of these annuity Indians. A civilization fund was provided, to be taken from their annuities, and expended in im provements on the lands of such of them as should abandon their tribal relations, and adopt the habits and modes of life of the white race. To ad such, lands were to be assigned in severalty, eighty acres to each head of a family. On these farms were to be erected the necessary farm-buildings, and farming implements and cattle were to be furnished them. In the absence of the famdy from the house and fields, thus deserted, the wandering \"blanket In dians\" commit whatever destruction of fences or tenements their desires or necessities may suggest. This perennial process goes on; so that in the spring when the disheartened farmer Indian re turns to his desolate home, to prepare again for another crop, he looks forward with no different results for the coming winter. It will be seen, from this one dlustration, drawn from the actual results of the civilizing process, how hopeless was the prospect of elevating one class of related savages without at the same time protecting them from the incursions of their own relatives, against whom the class attempted to be favored, had no redress. In this attempt to civil ize these Dakota Indians the forty years, less or more, of missionary and other efforts have been measurably lost, and the money spent in that di rection, if not wasted, sadly misapplied. In addition to these favors the government offered them pay for such labors of value as were performed, in addition to the crops they raised. Indian farmers now augmented rapidily, until the appalling outbreak in 1862, at which time about one hundred and sixty had taken advantage of the munificent provisions of the treaty. A number of farms, some 160, had good, snug brick houses erected upon them. Among these civilized savages was Little Crow, and many of these farmer- Indians belonged to his own band. The treaty of 1858 had opened for settlement a vast frontier country of the most attractive char acter, in the Vadey of the Minnesota, and the streams putting into the Minnesota, on either side, such as Beaver creek, Saered Heart, Hawk and Chippewa rivers and some other small streams, were flourishing settlements of white families. Within this ceded tract, ten miles wide, were the scattered settlements of Birch Coolie, Patterson Rapids, on the Sacred Heart, and others as far up as the Upper Agency at Yellow Medicine, in Ren ville county. The county of Brown adjoined the reservation, and was, at the time of which we are now writing, settled mostly by Germans. In this county was the flourishing town of New Ulm, and a thriving settlement on the Big Cottonwood and Watonwan, consisting of German and American pioneers, who had selected this lovely and fertile valley for their future homes. The Indians disliked the idea of taking any por tion of the general fund belonging to the tribe for the purpose of carrying out the civilization scheme- Those Indians who retained the \"blanket,\" and hence caded \"blanket Indians,\" denounced the measure as a fraud upon their rights. The chase was then a God-given right; this scheme forfeited that ancient natural right, as it pointed unmistaka bly to the destruction of the chase. But to the friends of Indian races, the course inaugurated seemed to be, step by step, lifting these rude children of the plains to a higher level. This scheme, however, was to a great degree thwarted by the helpless condition of the \"blanket Indians\" during a great portion of the year, and their persistent determination to remain followers of the chase, and a desire to continue on the war- Other counties, Blue Earth, Nicodet, Sibley, Meeker, McLeod, Kandiyohi, Monongalia and Murray, were all situated in the finest portions of the state. Some of the valleys along the streams, such as Butternut vadey and others of similar character, were lovely as Wyoming and as fertile as the Garden of Eden. These countie3, with others somewhat removed from the direct attack of the Indians in the massacre, as Wright, Stearns and Jackson, and even reaching on the north to Fort Abercrombie, thus extending from Iowa to the Valley of the Red River of the North, were severady involved in the consequences of the war- path. When the chase fails, the \"blanket Indians\" re- sort to their relatives, the farmers, pitch their tepees around their houses, and then commence the process of eating them out of house and home. When the ruin is complete, the farmer Indians, driven by the law of self-preservation, with their wives and chddren, leave their homes to seek such subsistence as the uncertain fortunes of the chase may yield."], [194, "180 HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. fare of 1862. This extended area had at the time a population of over fifty thousand people, princi pady in the pursuit of agriculture; and although the settlements were in their infancy, the people were happy and contented, and as prosperous as any simdar community in any new country on the American continent, since the landing of the Pd grini Fathers. section towards the government. In his report of that year, made to the Indian department, Major Prichette says: \"The complaint which runs through ad their coun cils points to the imperfect performance, or non-ful fillment of treaty stipulations. Whether these were wed or id founded, it is not my promise to discuss. That such a belief prevads among them, impairing their confidence and good faith in the government, cannot be questioned.\" We have in short, traced the Dakota tribes of Minnesota from an early day, when the white man first visited and explored these then unknown re gions, to the time of the massacre. We have also given a synopsis of ad the most important treaties between them and the government, with an allu sion to the country adjacent to the reservations, and the probable number of people residing in the portions of the state ravaged by the savages. In one of these councils Jagmani said: \"The Indians sold their lands at Traverse des Sioux. I say what we were told. For fifty years they were to be paid $50,000 per annum. We were also promised $300,000, and that we have not seen.\" Mapipa Wicasta (Cloud Man), second chief of Jagmani 's band, said: \"At the treaty of Traverse des Sioux, $275,000 were to be paid them when they came upon their reservation; they desired to know what had be come of it. Every white man knows that they have been five years upon their reservation, and have yet heard nothing of it.\" CHAPTER XXXI. COMPLAINTS OF THE INDIANS TREATIES OF TRA- VERSE DES SIOUX AND MENDOTA OBJECTIONS TO THE MODE OF PAYMENT INKPADUTA MASSACRE AT SPIRIT LAKE PROOF OF CONSPIRACY \u2014IN- In this abridged form we can only refer in brief to these complaints; but the history would seem to lack completeness without the presentation of this feature. As the fact of the dissatisfaction ex isted, the government thought it worth whde to appoint Judge Young to investigate the charges made against the governor, of the then Minnesota territory, then acting, ex-officio, as superintendent of Indian affairs for that locality. Some short extracts from Judge Young's report are here pre sented : DIAN COUNCILS. In a former chapter the reader has had some account of the location of the several bands of of Sioux Indians in Minnesota, and their relation to the white settlements on the western border of the state. It is now proposed to state in brief some of the antecedents of the massacre. PROMINENT CAUSES. 1. By the treaty of Traverse des Sioux, dated July 23, 1851, between the United States and the Sissetons andWapatons, $275,000 were to be paid their chiefs, and a further sum of $30,000 was to be expended for their benefit in Indian improve ments. By the treaty of Mendota, dated August 5, 1851, the Medawakantons and Wapakutas were to receive the sum of $200,000, to be paid to their chief, and for an improvement fund the further sum of $30,000. These several sums, amounting in the aggregate to $555,000, these Indians, to whom they were payable, claim they were never paid, except, perhaps, a smad portion expended in improvements on the reservations. They became dissatisfied, and expressed their views in councd freely with the agent of the government. \"The governor is next charged with having paid over the greater part of the money, appropriated under the fourth article of the treaty of July 23 and August 5, 1851, to one Hugh Tyler, for pay ment or distribution to the 'traders' and 'half breeds,' contrary to the wishes and remonstrances of the Indians, and in violation of law and the stipulations contained in said treaties; and also in violation of his own solemn pledges, personally made to them, in regard to said payments. \"Of $275,000 stipulated to be paid under the first clause of the fourth article of the treaty of Traverse des Sioux, of July 24, 1851, the sum of $250,000, was delivered over to Hugh Tyler, by the governor, for distribution omong the 'traders' and 'half-breeds,' according to the arrangement made by the schedule of the Traders' Paper, dated at Traverse des Sioux, July 23, 1851.\" In 1857, the Indian department at Washington sent out Major Kintzing Prichette, a man of great experience, to inquire into the cause of this disaf-"], [195, "CAUSES OF IRRITATION. 181 \"For this large sum of money, Hugh Tyler ex ecuted two receipts to the Governor, as the attor ney for the 'traders' and 'half breeds;' .the one for $210,000 on account of the 'traders,' and the other for $40,000 on account of the ' half-breeds ;' the first dated at St. Paul, December 8, 1852, and the second at Mendota, December 11, 1852.\" mony it was evident that the money was not paid to the chiefs, either to the Sisseton, Wapaton, or Medawakanton bands, as they in open councd re quested; but that they were compelled to submit to this mode of payment to the traders, otherwise no payment would be made, and the money would be returned to Washington ; so that in violation of law they were compelled to comply with the Gov ernor's terms of payment, according to Hugh Ty ler's power of attorney. \"And of the sum of $110,000, stipulated to be paid to the Medawakantons, under the fourth ar ticle of the treaty of August 5, 1851, the sum of $70,000 was in hke manner paid over to the said Tyler, on a power of attorney executed to him by the traders and claimants, under the said treaty, on December 11, 1852. The receipts of the said Tyler to the Governor for this money, $70,000, is dated at St. Paul, December 13, 1852, making to gether the sum of $320,000. This has been shown to have been contrary to the wishes and remon strances of a large majority of the Indians.\" And Judge Young adds : \" It is also believed to be in violation of the treaty stipulations, as well as the law making the appropriations under them.\" The examination of this complaint, on the part of the Indians, by the Senate of the United States, resulted in exculpating the Governor of Minnesota ( Governor Ramsey ) from any censure, yet the In dians were not satisfied with the treatment they had received in this matter by the accredited agents of the Government. 2. Another cause of irritation among these In dians arose out of the massacre of 1857, at Spirit Lake, known as the Inkpaduta massacre. Inkpa duta was an outlaw of the Wapakuta band of Sioux Indians, and his acts in the murders at Spirit Lake were entirely disclaimed by the \"annu ity Sioux.\" He had slain Tasagi, a Wapakuta chief, and several of his relatives, some twenty years previous, and had thereafter led a wandering and marauding hfe about the head waters of the Des Moines river. These several sums of money were to be paid to these Indians in open council, and soon after they were on their reservations provided for them by the treaties. In these matters the report shows they were not consulted at ad, in open council; but on the contrary, that arbitrary divisions and distributions were made of the entire fund, and their right denied to direct the manner in which they should be appropriated. See Acts of Con gress, August 30, 1852.. Inkpaduta was connected with several of the bands of annuity Sioux Indians, and similar rela tions with other bands existed among his fodowers. These ties extended even to the Yanktons west of the James river, and even over the Missouri. He was himself an outlaw for the murder of Tasagi and others as stated, and fodowed a predatory and lawless life in the neighborhood of his related tribes, for which the Sioux were themselves blamed. The Indians claimed, also, that the third section of the act was violated, as by that section the ap propriations therein referred to, should, in every instance, be paid directly to the Indians them selves, to whom it should be due, or to the tribe, or part of the tribe, per capita, \"unless otherwise the imperious interest of the Indians or some treaty stipulation should require the payment to be made otherwise, under the direction of the president.\" This money was never so paid. The report further states that a large sum, \"$55,000, was deducted by Hugh Tyler by way of discount and percentage on gross amount of payments, and that these exactions were made both from tra ders and half-breeds, without any previous agree ment, in many instances, and in such a way, in some, as to make the impression that unless they were submitted to, no payments would be made to such claimants at ad.\" The depredations of these Indians becoming in sufferable, and the settlers finding themselves suf ficiently strong, deprived them of their guns and drove them from the neighborhood. Recovering some of their guns, or, by other accounts, digging up a few old ones which they had buried, they proceeded to the settlement of Spirit Lake and demanded food. This appears to have been given to a portion of the band which had first arrived, to the extent of the means of those applied to. Soon after, Inkpaduta, with the remainder of his followers, who, in all, numbered twelve men and two boys, with some women who had lingered be hind, came in and demanded food also. The set tler gave him to understand that he had no more And, finady the report says, that from the testi-"], [196, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 182 were told by you that a thousand dollars would be paid for killing each of the murderers. We, with the men who went out, want to be paid for what we have done. Three men were kdled, as we know. ***** Ad of us want our money very much. A man of another band has done wrong, and we are to suffer for it. Our old women and children are hungry for this. I have seen $10,000 sent here to pay for our going out. I wish our soldiers were paid for it. I suppose our Great Father has more money than this.\" to give; whereupon Inkpaduta spoke to his eldest son to the effect that it was disgraceful to ask these people for food which they ought to take themselves, and not to have it thrown to them like dogs. Thus assured, the son immediately shot the man, and the murder of the whole famdy fol lowed. From thence they proceeded from house to house, untd every famdy in the settlement, without warning of those previously slain, were all massacred, except four women, whom they bore away prisoners, and afterward violated, with cir cumstances of brutality so abhorrent as to find no paradel in the annals of savage barbarity, unless we except the massacre of 1862, which occurred a few years later. Major Pritchette, the special government agent, thought it necessary to answer some points made by Mazakuti Mani, and spoke, in council, as fol lows: From Spirit Lake the murderers proceeded to Springfield, at the outlet of Shetek, or Pelican lake, near the head waters of the Des Moines river; where they remained encamped for some days, trading with Mr. William Wood from Man kato, and his brothers. Here they succeeded in lolling seventeen, including the Woods, making, in all, forty-seven persons, when the men raided, and firing upon them, they retreated and deserted that part of the country. Of the four women taken captives by Inkpaduta, Mrs. Stevens and Mrs. Noble were killed by the Indians, and Mrs. Marble and Miss Gardner were rescued by the Wapaton Sioux, under a promise of reward from the Government, and for which the three Indians who brought in these captives received each one thousand dodars. \"Your Great Father has sent me to see Super intendent Cuden, and to say to him he was wed satisfied with his conduct, because he had acted ac cording to his instructions. Your Great Father had heard that some of his white chddren had been cruelly and brutally murdered by some of the Sioux nation. The news was sent on the wings of the lightning, from the extreme north to the land of eternal summer, throughout which his chddren dwell. His young men wished to make war on the whole Sioux nation, and revenge the deaths of their brethren. But your Great Father is a just father and wishes to treat all his children alike with justice. He wants no innocent man punished for the guilty. He punishes the guilty alone. He expects that those missionaries who have been here teaching you the laws of the Great Spirit had tanghtyou this. Whenever a Sioux is injured by a white man your Great Father will punish him, and expects from the chiefs and warriors of the great Sioux nation that they will punish those In dians who injure the whites. He considers the Sioux as a part of his family ; and as friends and brothers he expects them to do as the whites do to them. He knows that the Sioux nation is divided into bands; but he knows also how they can ad band together for common protection. He expects the nation to punish these murderers, or to deliver them up. He expects this because they are his friends. As long as these murderers remain un punished or not delivered up, they are not acting as friends of their Great Father. It is for this reason that he has witheld the annuity. Your Great Father will have his white children pro tected ; and all who have told you that your Great Father is not able to punish those who injure them will find themselves bitterly mistaken. Your The Government had required of the Sioux the delivery of Inkpaduta and his band as the condi tion for the payment of their annuities. This was regarded by certain of the bands as a great wrong visited upon the innocent for the crimes of the guflty. One of their speakers (Mazakuti Mani), in a council held with the Sissetons and Wapatons, August 10, 1857, at Yedow Medicine, said: \"The soldiers have appointed me to speak for them. The men who kided the white people did not belong to us, and we did not expect to be called upon to account for the deeds of another band. We have always tried to do as our Great Father teds us. One of our young men brought in a captive woman. I went out and brought in the other. The soldiers came up here, and our men assisted to kill one of Inkpaduta's sons at this place. The lower Indians did not get up the war party for you; it was our Indians, the Wapatons and Sissetons. The soldiers here say that they"], [197, "REPORT OF SPECIAL AGENT. 183 Great Father desires to do good to all his children and wdl do all in his power to accomplish it; but he is firmly resolved to punish all who do wrong.\" be paid, as a signal to the military movements from Forts Ridgely and Randad. The special agent from the department waits an answer to this dispatch at Dunleith, and for instructions in the premises.\" After this, another similar council, September 1, 1857, was held with the Sisseton and Wapaton band of Upper Sioux at Yellow Medicine. Agent Flandrau, in the meantime, had succeeded in or ganizing a band of warriors, made up of ad the \"annuity\" bands, under Little Crow. This expe dition numbered altogether one hundred and six, besides four half-breeds. This party went out af ter Inkpaduta on the 22d of July, 1857, starting from Yellow Medicine. In this opinion Major Pritchette, in a letter of the same date, concurred, for reasons therein stated, and transmitted to the department. In this letter, among other things, the writer says: \"No encouragement was given to them that such a request would be granted. It is the opinion, however, of Superintendent Cuden, the late agent, Judge Flandrau, Governor Medary, and the general intelligent sentiment, that the an nuities may now with propriety, be paid, without a violation of the spirit of the expressed deter mination of the department to withhold them until the murderers of Spirit Lake should be surren dered or punished. It is argued that the present friendly disposition of the Indians is manifest, and should not be endangered by subjecting them to the wants incident to their condition during the coming winter, and the consequent temptation to depredation, to which the withholding their money would leave them exposed.\" On the 5th of August Major Pritchette reported to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, \"That the party of Indians, representing the entire Sioux na tion, under the nominal head of Little Crow, re turned yesterday from the expedition in search of Inkpaduta and his band,\" after an absence of thir teen days. As this outlaw, Inkpaduta, has achieved an im mortadty of infamy, it may be adowable in the historian to record the names of his followers. In kpaduta (Scarlet Point) heads the list, and the names of the eleven men are given by the wife of Tateyahe, who was killed by the party of Sioux under Little Crow, thus: Tateyahe (Shifting Wind); Makpeahoteman (Roaring Cloud), son of Inkpaduta, killed at Yellow Medicine; Makpiope ta (Fire Cloud), twin brother of Makpeohotoman; Tawachshawakan (His Mysterious Feather), kided in the late expedition; Bahata (Old Man); Kech omon (Putting on as He Walks); Huhsan (One Leg); Kahadai (Rattling), son-in-law of Inkpa duta; Fetoa-tanka (Big Face); Tatelidashinksha mani (One who Makes Crooked Wind as He Walks); Tachanchegahota (His Great Gun), and the two boys, children of Inkpaduta, not named. The major yielded this point for the reasons stated, yet he continued : \"If not improper for me to express an opinion, I am satisfied that, without chastising the whole Sioux nation, it is impossible to enforce the sur render of Inkpaduta and the remainder of his band.\" * * * \"Nothing less than the entire extirpation of Inkpaduta's murderous outlaws will satisfy the justice and dignity of the government, and vindicate outraged humanity.\" We here leave the Inkpaduta massacre, remark ing only that the government paid the Indians their annuities, and made no further effort to bring to condign punishment the remnant who had escaped ahve from the pursuit of Little Crow and his soldiers. This was a great error on the part of our government. The Indians construed it either as an evidence of weakness, or that the whites were afraid to pursue the matter further, lest it might terminate in stid more cbsastrous re sults to the infant settlement of the state border ing upon the Indian country. The result was, the Indians became more insolent than ever be fore. Little Crow and his adherents had found capital out of which to foment future difficulties in which the two races should become involved. And it is now beheved, and subsequent circum- After the band had been pursued by Little Crow into Lake Chouptijatanka (Big Dry Wood), distant twenty miles in a northwestern direction from Skuuk Lake, and three of them killed out right, wounding one, taking two women and a little child prisoners, the Indians argued that they had done sufficient to merit the payment of their annuities; and on the 18th of August, 1854, Maj. Cullen telegraphed the fodowing to the Hon. J. W. Denver, commissioner of Indian affairs : \"If the department concurs, I am of the opinion that the Sioux of the Mississippi, having done ad in their power to punish or surrender Inkpaduta and his band, their annuities may with propriety"], [198, "184 HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. stances have greatly strengthened that belief, that Little Crow, from the time the government ceased its efforts to punish Inkpaduta, began to agitate his great scheme of driving the whites from the state of Minnesota ; a scheme which finally cul minated in the ever-to-be-remembered massacre of August, A. D. 1862. Here, then, is the first cause, in accordance with a universal principle, in which the conflict of the two races had its origin. It was a conflict of knowledge with ignorance, of right with wrong. If this conflict were only mental, and the weapons of death had never been resorted to in a single instance, the result would have been the same. The inferior race must either recede before the su- perior, or sink into the common mass, and, like the raindrops fading upon the bosom of the ocean, lose ad traces of distinction. This warfare takes place the world over, on the principle of mental and material progress. The presence of the supe- rior light eclipses the inferior, and causes it to retire. Mind maTses aggression upon mind, and the superior, sooner or later, overwhelms the infe rior. This process may go on, with or without the conflict of physical organisms. The final result will be the same. The antecedent exciting causes of this massacre are numerous. The displaced agents and traders find the cause in the erroneous action of the Gov ernment, resulting in their removal from office. The statesman and the philosopher may unite in tracing the cause to improper theories as to the mode of acquiring the right to Indian lands. The former may locate the evd in our system of treaties, and the latter in our theories of govern ment. The philanthropist may find the cause in the absence of justice which we exhibit in ad our intercourse with the Indian races. The poet and the lovers of romance in human character find the true cause, as they believe, in the total absence of ad appreciation of the noble, generous, confiding traits peculiar to the native Indian. The Chris tian teacher finds apologies for acts of Indian atrocities in the deficient systems of mental and moral culture. Each of these different classes are satisfied that the great massacre of August, 1862, had its origin in some way intimately con nected with his favorite theory. Again, we come to the great law of right. The white race stood upon this undeveloped continent ready and willing to execute the Divine injunc tion, to replenish the earth and subdue it. On the one side stood the white race armed with his law; on the other the savage, resisting the execution of that law. The result could not be evaded by any human device. In the case before us, the Indian races were in the wrongful possession of a conti nent required by the superior right of the white man. This right, founded in the wisdom of God, eliminated by the ever-operative laws of progress, wdl continue to assert its dominion, with varying success, contingent on the use of means employed, until ad opposition is hushed in the perfect reign of the superior aggressive principle. Let us, for a moment, look at the facts, in rela- tion to the two races who had come into close con- tact with each other, and in the light of these facts, judge of the probable cause of this fearful codision. The white race, some two hundred years ago, had entered upon the material conquest of the American continent, armed with all the ap- pliances for its complete subjugation. On the shores of this prolific continent these new ele- ments came in contact with a race of savages with many of the traits peculiar to a common human- ity, yet, with these, exhibiting ad, or nearly ad, the vices of the most barbarous of savage races. The period of occupancy of this broad, fertile land was lost in the depths of a remote antiquity. The cidture of the sod, if ever understood, had been long neglected by this race, and the chase was theirprincipal mode of gaining a scanty sub- sistence. It had lost all that ennobled man, and was adve only to ad his degradations. The white man was at once acknowledged, the Indian being judge, superior to the savage race with which he had come in contact. With these seemingly necessary reflections, we introduce the remarks of the Sioux agent touching the antecedents of the great massacre, unparalleled in the history of the conflict of the races. The agent gives his peculiar views, and they are worthy of careful consideration. Major Thomas Galbraith, Sioux Agent, says: \" The radical, moving cause of the outbreak is, I am satisfied, the ingrained and fixed hostihty of the savage barbarian to reform and civilization. As in ad barbarous communities, in the history of the world, the same people have, for the most part, resisted the encroachments of civilization upon their ancient customs; so it is in the case before us. Nor does it matter materially in what shape civilization makes its attack. Hostde, opposing forces meet in conflict, and a war of social elements"], [199, "VIEWS OF MAJOR GALBRAITH. 185 is the resalt \u2014 civilization is aggressive, and bar barism stubbornly resistant. Sometimes, indeed, civilization has achieved a bloodless victory, but generally it has been otherwise. Christianity, it self, the true basis of civilization, has, in most in stances, waded to success through seas of blood. * * * Having stated thus much, I state as a settled fact in my mind, that the encroachments of Christianity, and its handmaid, civilization, upon the habits and customs of the Sioux Indians, is the cause of the late terrible Sioux outbreak. There were, it is true, many immediate inciting causes, which will be alluded to and stated hereafter, but they are subsidiary to, and developments of, or incident to, the great cause set forth. * * * But that the recent Sioux outbreak would have happened at any rate, as a result, a fair conse quence of the cause here stated, I have no more doubt than I doubt that the great rebellion to overthrow our Government would have occurred had Mr. Liucoln never been elected President of the United States. to protect the \"farmer\" from the hostdity of the \"blanket Indians.\" \"During my term, and up to the time of the out break, about one hundred and seventy-five had their hair cut and had adopted the habits and cus toms of white men. \" For a time, indeed, my hopes were strong that civdization would soon be in the ascendant. But the increase of the civdization party and their evi dent prosperity, only tended to exasperate the In dians of the 'ancient customs,' and to widen the breach. But whde these are to be enumerated, it may be permitted me to hope that the radical cause wid not be forgotten or overlooked; and I am bold to express this desire, because, ever since the outbreak, the public journals of the country, religious and secular, have teemed with editorials by and communications from 'reliable individuals,' politicians, philanthropists, philosophers and hired 'penny-a-liners,' mostly mistaken and sometimes willfully and grossly false, giving the cause of the Indian raid.\" \" Now as to the existing or immediate causes of the outbreak: By my predecessor a new and radical system was inaugurated, practically, and, in its inauguration, he was aided by the Christian missionaries and by the Government. The treaties of 1858 were ostensibly made to carry this new system into effect. The theory, in substance, was to break up the community-system which obtained among the Sioux; weaken and destroy their tribal relations, and individualize them, by giving them each a separate home. * * * On the 1st day of June, A. D. 1861, when I entered upon the duties of my office, I found that the system had just been inaugurated. Some hundred fami lies of the Annuity Sioux had become novitiates, and their relatives and friends seemed to be favor ably disposed to the new order of things. But I also found that, against these, were arrayed over five thousand \"Annuity Sioux,\" besides at least three thousand Yanktonais, all inflamed by the most bitter, relentless, and devdish hostdity. Major Galbraith enumerates a variety of other exciting causes of the massacre, which our limit wid not allow us to insert in this volume. Among other causes, * * that the United States was itself at war, and that Washington was taken by the negroes. * * But none of these were, in his opinion, the cause of the outbreak, The Major then adds: \"Grievances such as have been related, and numberless others akin to them, were spoken of, recited, and chanted at their councils, dances, and feasts, to such an extent that, in their excitement, in June, 1862, a secret organization known as the ' Soldier's Lodge,' was founded by the young men and soldiers of the Lower Sioux, with the object, as far as I was able to learn through spies and informers, of preventing the 'traders' from going to the pay-tables, as had been their custom. Since the outbreak I have become satisfied that the real object of this 'Lodge' was to adopt measures to 'clean out' ad the white people at the end of the payment.\" \" I saw, to some extent, the difficulty of the situation, but I determined to continue, if in my power, the civdization system. To favor it, to aid and build it up by every fair means, I advised, encouraged, and assisted the farmer novitiates; in short, I sustained the policy inaugurated by my predecessor, and sustained and recommended by the Government. I soon discovered that the system could not be successful without a sufficient force Whatever may have been the cause of the fear ful and bloody tragedy, it is certain that the man ner of the execution of the infernal deed was a deep-laid conspiracy, long cherished by Little Crow, taking form under the guise of the \"Sol diers' Lodge,\" and matured in secret Indian coun cils. In all these secret movements Little Crow was the moving spirit."], [200, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 186 Now the opportune moment seemed to have come. Only thirty soldiers were stationed at Fort Ridgley. Some thirty were all that Fort Ripley could muster, and at Fort Abercrombie one com pany, under Captain Van Der Hork, was all the whites could depend upon to repel any attack in that quarter. The whole effective force for the defense of the entire frontier, from Pembina to the Iowa line, did not exceed two hundred men. The annuity money was daily expected, and no troops except about one hundred men at Yellow Medi cine, had been detailed, as usual, to attend the an ticipated payment. Here was a glittering prize to be paraded before the minds of the excited sav ages. The whites were weak; they were engaged in a terrible war among themselves; their atten tion was now directed toward the great struggle in the South. At such a time, offering so many chances for rapine and plunder, it would be easy to unite, at least, all the annuity Indians in one common movement. Little Crow knew full well that the Indians could easily be made to believe that now was a favorable time to make a grand attack upon the border settlements. In view of all the favorable auspices now concurring, a famous Indian council was called, which was fully attended by the \" Soldiers' Lodge.\" Rev. S. R. Riggs, in his late work, 1880, (\"Mary and I\"); referring to the outbreak, says: the infamous council. Comparing the statement of the narrative with the known occurrences of the times, that council preceded the attack on the Government stores at the Upper Agency, and was convened on Sunday night; the attack on the Upper Agency took place the next day, Monday, the 4th of August; and on the same day, an at tempt was made to take Fort Ridgely by strategy. Not the slightest danger was anticipated. Only thirty soldiers occupied the post at Fort Ridgly, and this was deemed amply sufficient in times of peace. But we wid not longer detain the reader from the denouement of this horrible plot. Our informant states the evidences of the de crees of the council of the 3d of August, thus: \"I was looking toward the Agency and saw a large body of men coming toward the fort, and supposed them soldiers returning from the pay ment at Yellow Medicine. On a second look, I observed they were mounted, and knowing, at this time, that they must be Indians, was surprised at seeing so large a body, as they were not expected. I resolved to go into the garrison to see what it meant, having, at the time, not the least suspicion that the Indians intended any hostile demonstra tion. When I arrived at the garrison, I found Sergeant Jones at the entrance with a mounted howitzer, charged with shell and cauister-shot, pointed towards the Indians, who were removed but a short distance from the guard house. I inquired of the sergeant what it meant? whether any danger was apprehended? He replied indif ferently, \"No, but that he thought it a good rule to observe that a soldier should always be ready for any emergency.\" \"On August 17th, the outbreak was commenced in the border white settlements at Acton, Minne sota. That night the news was carried to the Lower Sioux Agency, and a council of war was called.\" * * * \"Something of the kind had been meditated and talked of, and prepared for undoubtedly. Some time before this, they had formed the Tee-yo-tee-pee, or Soldiers' Lodge.\" These Indians had requested the privilege to dance in the inclosure surrounding the fort. On this occasion that request was refused them. But I saw that, about sixty yards west of the guard house, the Iudians were making the necessary preparations for a dance. I thought nothing of it as they had frequently done the same thing, but a little further removed from the fort, under some what different circumstances. I considered it a singular exhibition of Indian foolishness, and, at the solicitation of a few ladies, went out and was myself a spectator of the dance. A memorable council, convened at Little Crow's village, near the Lower Agency, on Sunday night previous to the attack on Fort Ridgley, and pre cisely two weeks before the first massacres at Ac ton. Little Crow was at this council, and he was not wanting in ability to meet the greatness of the occasion. The proceedings of this council, of course, were secret. Some of the results arrived at, however, have since come to the writer of these pages. The councd matured the details of a con spiracy, which for atrocity has hitherto never found a place in recorded' history, not excepting that of Cawnpore. \"When the dance was concluded, the Indians sought and obtained permission to encamp on some rising ground about a quarter of a mile west of the garrison. To this ground they soon re paired, and encamped for the night. The next The evidence of that conspiracy comes to us, in part, from the relation of one who was present at"], [201, "EVIDENCE OF CONSPIRACY. 187 morning, by 10 o'clock, all had left the vicinity of the garrison, departing in the direction of the Lower Agency. This whole matter of the dance was so conducted as to lead most, if not all, the residents of the garrison to bedeve that the In dians had paid them that visit for the purpose of dancing and obtaining provisions for a feast. gun until all this party of Indians had entirely disappeared from the vicinity of the garrison. \"Some two weeks after this time, those same In dians, with others, attacked Fort Ridgley and, af ter some ten days' siege, the garrison was relieved by the arrival of soldiers under Colonel H. H Sib ley. The second day after Colonel Sibley arrived, a Frenchman of pure or mixed blood appeared before Sergeant Jones, in a very agitated manner, and intimated that he had some disclosures to make to him; but no sooner had he made this in timation than he became extremely and violently agitated, and seemed to be in a perfect agony of mental perturbation. Sergeant Jones said to him, 'If you have anything to disclose, you ought, at once, to make it known.' The man repeated that he had disclosures to make, but that he did not dare to make them; and although Sergeant Jones urged him by every consideration in his power to tell what he knew, the man seemed to be so com pletely under the dominion of terror, that he was unable to divulge the great secret. 'Why,' said he, 'they will kill me; they will kill my wife and children.' Saying which he turned and walked away. \"Some things were observable that were unu sual. The visitors were all warriors, ninety-six in number, all in undress, except a very few who wore calico shirts; and, in addition to this, they all car ried arms, guns and tomahawks, with ammunition pouches suspended around their shoulders. Pre vious to the dance, the war implements were de posited some two hundred yards distant, where they had left their ponies. But even this circum stance, so far as it was then known, excited no suspicion of danger or hostilities in the minds of the residents of the garrison. These residents were thirty -five men; thirty soldiers and five citi zens, with a few women and children. The guard that day consisted of three soldiers; one was walk ing leisurely to and fro in front of the guard house; the other two were off duty, passing about and taking their rest; and all entirely without ap prehension of danger from Indians or any other foe. As the Indians left the garrison without do ing any mischief, most of us supposed that no evil was meditated by them. But there was one man who acted on the supposition that there was al ways danger surrounding a garrison when visited by savages; that man was Sergeant Jones. From the time he took his position at the gun he never left it, but acted as he said he believed it best to do, that was to be always ready. He not only re mained at the gun himself, but retained two other men, whom he had previously trained as assistants to work the piece. \"Shortly after the first interview, this man re turned to Sergeant Jones, when again the Ser geant urged him to disclose what he knew; and promised him that if he would do so, he would keep his name a profound secret forever; that if the information which he should disclose should ]ead to the detection and punishment of the guilty the name of the informant should never be made known. Being thus assured, the Frenchman soon became more calm. Hesitating a moment, he in quired of Sergeant Jones if he remembered that, some two weeks ago, a party of Indians came down to the fort to have a dance? Sergeant Jones replied that he did. 'Why,' said the French man, 'do you know that these Indians were all warriors of Little Crow, or some of the other lower bands ? Sir, these Indians had all been selected for the purpose, and came down to Fort Ridgely by the express command of Little Crow and the other chiefs, to get permission to dance; and when all suspicion should be completely lulled, in the midst of the dance, to seize their weapons, kdl every person in the fort, seize the big guns, open the magazine, and secure the ammunition, when they should be joined by ad the remaining war riors of the lower bands. Thus armed, and in creased by numbers, they were to proceed together \"Shortly before dark, without disclosing his in tentions, Sergeant Jones said to his wde: 'I have a little business to attend to to-night; at bed-time I wish you to retire, and not to wait for me.' As he had frequently done this before, to discharge some official duty at the quartermaster's office, she thought it not singular, but did as he had re quested, and retired at the usual hour. On awak ening in the morning, however, she was surprised at finding that he was not there, and had not been in bed. In truth, this faithful soldier had stood by his gun throughout the entire night, ready to fire, if occasion required, at any moment during that time; nor could he be perjuaded to leave that"], [202, "188 HISTORY OF THE SIOUX .MASSACRE. down the valley of the Minnesota. With this force and these weapons they were assured they could drive every white man beyond the Missis sippi.' Acton murderers were seen at the rrill on Crow river, six miles from Hutchinson, with the team taken from Acton; so that these Indians did not go to the Lower Agency, but remained in th( country about Hutchinson. One of the number only returned to the Agency by the next morning after the council at Rice Creek had been held. All that followed in the bloody drama, originated at this council of Death, over which Little Crow presided, on Sunday afternoon, the 17th day of August, 1862, on the evening of the same day of the Acton murders. The general massacre of all white men was by order of this council, to com mence at the Agency, on the morning of the 18th, and at as many other points, simultaneously, as could be reached by the dawn of day, radiating from that point .as a center. The advantage gained by the suddenness of the attack, and the known panic that would result, was to be followed up until every settlement was massacred, Fort Ridgley taken, both Agencies burned, New Ulm, Mankato. St. Peter, and all the towns on the river destroyed, the whole country plundered and devas tated, and as many of the inhabitants as were left alive were to be driven beyond the Mississippi river. The decree of this savage couned, matured on a Christian Sabbath, by Indians, who were sup posed to be civilized, so immediately after atten tively listening to the gospel of peace, filled the measure of the long-cherished conspiracy matured by Little Crow, until it was full of the most hope ful results to his polluted and brutal nature. \"Once an Indian, always an Indian,\" seems in this instance to have been horribly demonstrated. \"Ad this, the Frenchman informed Sergeant Jones, he had learned by being present at a coun cd, and from conversations had with other Indians, who had told him that they had gone to the gar rison for that very purpose. When he had con cluded this revelation, Sergeant Jones inquired, Why did they not execute their purpose? Why did they not take the fort ?' The Frenchman re plied: -Because they saw, during ad their dance, and then stay at the fort, that big gun constantly pointed at them.' \" Interpreter Quinn, now dead, told the narrator of the foregoing incidents that Little Crow had said, repeatedly, in their councils, that the Indians could kill all the white men in the Minnesota Val ley. In this way, he said, we can get ad our lands back; that the whites would not want these lands, and that they could get double annuities. Some of the councils at which these suggestions of Lit tle Crow were made, dated, he said, as far back as the summer of 1857, immediately after the Ink paduta war. On the 17th day of August, 1862, Little Crow, Inkpaduta, and Little Priest, the latter one of the Winnebago chiefs, attended church at the Lower Agency, and seemed to listen attentively to the services, conducted by the Rev. J. D. Hinman. On the afternoon of that day Little Crow invited these Indians to his hous?, a short distance above the Agency. On the same day an Indian council was held at Rice Creek, sixteen miles above the Lower Agency, attended by the Soldiers' Lodge. Inkpaduta, it ia believed, and Little Priest, with some thirteen Winnebago warriors, attended this council. Why this council was held, and what was its object, can easily be imagined. The de crees of the one held two weeks before had not been executed. The reason why the fort was not taken has been narrated. The other part of the same scheme, the taking of the agency at the Yellow Medicine, on the same day the fort was to have fallen, wid be aduded to in another chapter. It then became necessary for the conspirators to hold another council, to devise new plans for the exe cution of their nefarious designs upon the whites. CHAPTER XXXII.

The change in the administration of the Gov ernment in 1861, resulting, as it did, in a general change in the minor offices throughout the coun try, carried into retirement Major Wdliam J. Cul len, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Northern Superintendency, and Major Joseph R. Brown, Agent for the Sioux, whose places were filled respectively by Colonel Clark W. Thomp son and Major Thomas J. Galbraith. Colonel The Acton tragedy, forty miles distant, had taken place but a few hours before this couned was con vened. On Monday, the 18th of August, these"], [203, "MAI OR GALBRAITWS REPORT. 189 Thompson entered upon the duties of his office in May of that year, and Major Galbraith on the first day of June. In that month the new agent and many of the new employes, with their fami lies, took up their residence on the reservations. Galbraith, came into office too late to insure a large crop that year. He says: \"The autumn of 1861 closed upon us rather un favorably. The crops were light; especially was this the case with the Upper Sioux; they had little or nothing. As heretofore communicated to the Department, the cut-worms destroyed all the Sisetons, and greatly injured the crop of the Wapatons, Medawakantons, Wapakutas. For these latter I purchased on credit, in anticipation of the Agricultural and Civdization Funds, large quantities of pork and flour, at current rates, to support them during the winter. These employes, save a few young men who were employed as laborers, were, with two excep tions, men of families, it being the policy of the agent to employ among the Indians as few un married men as possible. During that year nothing occurred on the res ervations of an unusual character more than the trouble with which the Agents had always to deal at every semi-annual gathering at the Agencies. We say \"semi-annual,\" because they came in the summer to draw their annuities, and again in the autumn for their winter supply of goods. \"Early in the autumn, in view of the necessitous situation of the Sisetons, I made a requisition on the department for the sum of $5,000, out of the special fund for the relief of 'poor and destitute Indians;' and, in anticipation of receiving this money, made arrangements to fe.d the old and in firm men, and the women and children of these people. I directed the Rev. S. R. Riggs to make the selection, and furnish me a list. It has been usual at the payment of annuities to have a small force of troops to guard against any untoward event which might otherwise occur. The payment to the lower bands, in 1861, was made in the latter part of June, and to the upper bands about the middle of July. These pay ments were made by Superintendent Thompson in person. \"He carefully did this, and we fed, in an econ omical, yea, even parsimonious way, about 1,500 of these people from the middle of December until nearly the first of April. We had hoped to get them off on their spring hunt earlier, but a tre mendous and unprecedented snow-storm during the last days of February prevented. The Sisseton bands came down to the Agency at a very early day, as had always been their habit, long before the arrival of the money, bringing with them a large body of Yanktonais (not annuity Sioux), who always came to the payments, claiming a right to a share of the an nuities issued to the Indians. \"In response to my requisition, I received $3,000, and expended very nearly $5,000, leaving a deficiency not properly chargable to the regular funds, of about $2,000. These wild hunters of the plains were an un failing element of trouble at the payments to the upper bands. At this last payment they were in force, and by their troublesome conduct, caused a delay of some days in the making of the payments. This was, however, no unusual occurrence, as they always came with a budget of grievances, upon which they were wont to dilate in council. This remark is equally true of the annuity Indians. Indeed, it would be very strange if a payment could be made without a demand, on the part of the \"young men,\" for three or four times the amount of their annual dues. \"These people, it is believed, must have per ished had it not been for this scanty assistance. In addition to this, the regidar issues were made to the farmer Indians in payment for their labor. **** **# * * \"In the month of August, 1861, the superinten dents of farms were directed to have ploughed 'in the fad,' in the old public and neglected private fields, a sufficient quantity of land to provide 'plantings' for such Indians as could not be pro vided with oxen and implements. In pursuance of this direction, there were ploughed, at rates ranging from $1.50 to $2,00 per acre, ac cording to the nature of the work, by teams and men hired for the purpose, for the Lower Sioux, about 500 acres, and for the Upper Sioux, about 475 acres. There were, also, at the same time, ploughed by the farmer Indians and the depart ment teams, about 250 acres for the Lower, and These demands were usually accompanied by overt acts of violence; yet the payment was made; and this time, after the payment, ad departed to their village at Big Stone Lake, They came again in the fall, drew their supply of goods, and went quietly away. It so turned out, however, that the new agent,"], [204, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 190 about 325 acres for the Upper Sioux. This fall ploughing was continued untd the frost prevented its further prosecution. It was done to facidtate the work of the agricultural department, and to kid the worms which had proved so injurious the previous year. * * * belonging to the quarter in which the goods, im plements, or supplies, were expended.\" \"Thus it will be seen that, in the spring of 1862, there was on hand suppdes and material sufficient to carry us through the coming year. * * * Thus, to all appearance, the spring season opened propitiously. * * * To carry out my original design of having as much as possible planted for the Indians at Big Stone Lake and Lac qui Parle as early in the month of May, 1862, as the condi tion of the swoden streams would permit, I visited Lac qui Parle and Big Stone Lake, going as far as North Island, in Lake Traverse, having with me Antoine Freniere, United States Interpreter, Dr. J. L. Wakefield, physician of the Upper Sioux, and Nelson Givens, assistant Agent. At Lac qui Parle I found the Indians wdling and anxious to plant. I inquired into their condition and wants, and made arrangements to have them supplied with seeds and implements, and directeel Amos W. Huggins, the school teacher there, to aid and in struct them in their work, and to make proper distribution of the seeds and implements furnished, and placed at his disposal an ox-team and wagon and two breaking-teams, with instructions to de vote his whole time and attention to the superin tendence and instruction of the resident Indians during the planting season, and until the crops were cultivated and safely harvested. \"The carpenter-shops at both Agencies were supplied with lumber for the manufacture and re pair of sleds, wagons, and other farming utensils. Sheds were erected for the protection of the cattle and utensds of the depertment, and the farmer Indians, assisted by the department carpenters, erected stables, pens, and out-houses for the pro tection of their cattle, horses and utensils. * Hay, grain, and other supplies were provided, and, in short, every thing was done which the means at command of the agent would justify. \"The work of the autumn being thus closed, I set about making preparations for the work of the next spring and summer, and in directing the work of the winter. I made calculations to erect, during the summer and autumn of 1862, at least fifty dwelling-houses for Indian families, at an estimated average cost of $300 each; and also to aid the fanner Indians in erecting as many ad ditional dwellings as possible, not to exceed thirty or forty;' and to have planted for the Lower Sioux, at least 1,200 acres, and for the Upper Sioux, at least 1,300 acres of crops, and to have all the land planted, except that at Big Stone Lake, inclosed by a fence. \"I also found the Indians at Big Stone Lake and Lake Traverse very anxious to plant, but without any means whatever so to do. I looked over their fields in order to see what could be done. After having inquired into the whole matter, I instructed Mr. Givens to remain at Big Stone Lake and su perintend and direct the agricultural operations of the season, and to remain there until it was too late to plant any more. I placed at his disposal ten double plough teams, with man to operate them, and ordered forward at once one hundred bushels of seed corn and five hundred bushels of seed potatoes, with pumpkin, squash, turnip, and other seeds, in reasonable proportion, together with a sufficient supply of ploughs, hoes, and other implements for the Indians, and a black smith to repair breakages; and directed him to see that every Indian, and every Indian horse or pony, did as much work as was possible. * * \"To carry out these calculations, early in the the winter the superintendents of farms, the black smiths, the carpenters, and the superintendents of schools were directed to furnish estimates for the amount of agricultural implements, horses, oxen, wagons, carts, building material, iron, steel, tools, and supplies needed to carry on successfully their several departments for one year from the open ing of navigation in the spring of 1862. \"These estimates were prepared and furnished me about the 1st of February. In accordance with these estimates, I proceeded to purchase, in open market, the articles and supplies recommend ed. \"I made the estimates for one year, and pur chases accordingly, in order to secure the benefit of transportation by water in the spring, and thus avoid the delays, vexations, and extra expense of transportation by land in the fall. The bulk of purchases were made with the distinct understand ing that payment would be made out of the funds \"On my way down to the agency, I visited the plantings of Tahampih'da, (Rattling Moccasin), Mazasha, (Red Iron), Mahpiya Wicasta, (Cloud Man), and Rattling Cloud, and found that the"], [205, "MAJOR GALDRAITHS REPORT. 191 Superintendent of Farms for the Upper Sioux had, in accordance with my instructions, been faithfully attending to the wants of these bands. He had supplied them with implements and seeds, and I left them at work. On my arrival at the Agency, I found that the farmer Indians residing there abouts had, in my absence, been industriously at work, and had not only completed their plowing, but had planted very extensively. The next day after my arrival at the Agency, I visited each farmer Indian at the Yellow Medicine, and con gratulated him on his prospect for a good crop, and spoke to him such words of encouragement as occurred to me. it may be permitted me to remark to Mr. Hug gins, who was born and raised among the Sioux, and Miss La frambois, who was a Sioux mixed blood, were two persons entirely capable and in every respect qualified for the discharge of the duties of their situation, than whom the Indians had no more devoted friends. They lived among the Indians of choice, because they thought they could be beneficial to them. Mr. Huggins exer cised nothing but kindness toward them. He fed them when hungry, olothed them when naked, attended them when sick, and advised and cheered them in all their difficulties. He was intelligent, energetic, industrious, and good, and yet he was one of the first victims of the outbreak, shot down hke a dog by the very Indians whom he had so long and so well served. ******* \"The next day I proceeded to the Lower Agency, and then taking with me Mr. A. H. Wagner, the Superintendent of Farms for the Lower Sioux, I went around each planting, and, for the second time, visited each farmer Indian, and found that, in general, my instructions had been carried out. The plowing was generally completed in good order, and the planting nearly all done, and many of the farmer Indians were engaged in repairing old and making new fences. I was pleased and gratified, and so told the Indians \u2014 the prospect was so encouraging. * * \"In the month of June, 1862, being well aware of the influence exerted by Little Crow over the blanket Indians, and, by his plausibdity, led to believe that he intended to act in good faith, I promised to build him a good brick house pro vided that he would agree to aid me in bringing around the idle young men to habits of indusiry and civilization, and that he would abandon the leadership of the blanket Indians and become a 'white man.' \"About the first of July I visited all the plant- ings of both the Upper and Lower Sioux, except those at Big Stone Lake, and found, in nearly every instance, the prospects for good crops very hopeful indeed. The superintendents of farms, the male school teachers, and all the employes assisting them, had done their duty. About this time Mr. Givens returned from Big Stone Lake, and reported to me his success there. From all I knew and all I thus learned, I was led to believe that we would have no 'starving Indians' to feed the next winter, and little did I dream of the un- fortunate and terrible outbreak which, in a short time, burst upon us, * * * \"This being well understood, as I thought, I directed Mr. Nairn, the carpenter of the Lower Sioux, to make out the plan and estimates for Crow's house, and to proceed at once to make the window and door frames, and to prepare the lum ber necessary for the building, and ordered the teamsters to deliver the necessary amount of brick as soon as possible. Little Crow agreed to dig the cellar and haul the necessary lumber, both of which he had commenced. The carpenter had nearly completed his part of the work, and the brick was being promptly delivered at the time of the outbreak. \"In the fall of 1861, a good and substantial school-room and dwelling, a store-house and black smith-shop, were completed at Lac qui Parle, and, about the first of November, Mr. Amos W. Hug gins and his family occupied the dwelling, and, assisted by Miss Julia La frambois, prepared the school-room, and devoted their whole time to teaching such Indian chddren as they could in duce to attend the school. \"On the 15th of August, only three days pre vious to the outbreak, I had an interview with Little Crow, and he seemed to be well pleased and satisfieei. Little indeed did I suspect, at that time, that he would be the leader in the terrible outbreak of the 18th.\" There were planted, according to the statement of Agent Galbraith in his report, on the lower reservation, one thousand and twenty-five acres of corn, two hundred and sixty acres of potatoes, sixty acres of turnips and ruta-bagas, and twelve acres of wheat, besides a large quantity of field \"The storehouse was supplied with provisions, which Mr. Huggins was instructed to issue to the children and their parents at his discretion. Here"], [206, "192 HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. and garden vegetables. These crops, at a low estimate, would have harvested, in the fad, 74,865 bushels. There were, on the lower reservation, less than three thousand Indians, all told. This crop, therefore, would have yielded fud twenty five bushels to each man, woman and chdd, in cluding the blanket as wed as the farmer Indians groceries, flour and meats, powder, shot, lead, etc., and we confidently submit to the enlightened reader the whole question of their adeged griev ances, confident that there can be but one verdict at their hands, and that the paternal care of the Government over them was good and just; nay, generous, and that those having the immediate su pervision of their interests were performing their whole duty, honestly and nobly. There were, also, of growing crops, in fine con dition, on the upper reservation, one thousand one hundred and ten acres of corn, three hundred acres of potatoes, ninety acres of turnips and ruta-bagas, and twelve acres of wheat, and field and garden vegetables in due proportion. These, at a low estimate, would have harvested 85,740 bushels. There were, on the upper reservation, a little over four thousand annuity Sioux. This crop, therefore, would have harvested them about twenty-one bushels for each man, woman and chdd, including, also, the blanket Indians. The hopes of the philanthropist and Christian beat high. They believed the day was not far distant when it could be said that the Sioux Indi ans, as a race, not only could be civilized, but that here were whole tribes who were civilized, and had abandoned the chase and the war-path for the cul tivation of the soil and the arts of peace, and that the juggleries and sorcery of the medicine-men had been abandoned for the mdder teachings of the missionaries of the Cross. Thus, under the beneficent workings of the hu mane policy of the Government inaugurated in 1858, they were fast becoming an independent people. Let it be borne in mind, however, that these results, so beneficial to the Indian, were ac complished only through the sleepless vigilance and untiring energy of those who had the welfare of these rude, savage beings in their care. How these high hopes were dashed to the earth, extinguished in an ocean of blood, and their own bright prospects utterly destroyed, by their horri ble and monstrous perfidy and unheard of atroci ties, it will be our work, in these pages, to show. We are now rapidly approaching the fatal and bloody denouement, the terrible 18th of August, the memory of which will linger in the minds of the survivors of its tragic scenes, and the succeed ing days and weeks of horror and blood, tid rea son kindly ceases to perform its office, and blots out the fearful record in the obdvion of the grave. Major Galbraith, after giving these statistics of the crops on the reservations, and the arrange ments made for gathering hay, by the Indians, for their winter's use, says: \" I need hardly say that our hopes were high at the prospects before us, nor need I relate my chagrin and mortification when, in a moment, I found these high hopes blasted forever.\" Again we quote from the able report of Major Galbraith : \"About the 25th of June, 1862, a number of the chiefs and head men of the Sissetons and Wapa tons visited the Agency and inquired about the payments; whether they were going to get any ( as they had been told, as they adeged, that they would not be paid,) and if so, how much, and when? I answered them that they would cer tainly be paid; exactly how much I could not say, but that it would be nearly, if not quite, a full payment; that I did not know when the pay ment would be made, but that I felt sure it could not be made before the 20th of July. I advised them to go home, and admonished them not to come back again untd I sent for them. I issued pro visions, powder and shot and tobacco to them, and they departed. Such, then, was the concdtion, present and pros pective, of the \"Annuity Sioux Indians,\" in the summer of 1862. No equal number of pioneer settlers on the border could, at that time, make a better showing than was exhibited on these reser vations. They had in fair prospect a surplus over and above the wants of the entire tribes for the coming year. This had never before occurred in their history. The sagacity and wise forethought of their agent, and the unusually favorable, season, had amply provided against the possibility of recurring want. The coming winter would have found their granaries full to overflowing. Add to this the fact that they had a large cash annuity coming to them from the Government, as well as large amounts of goods, consisting of blankets, cloths, \" In a few days after I went to the Lower Agency, and spoke to the lower Indians in regard to their payments. As they all dved within a few mil.-s of"], [207, "ATTACK ON UPPER AGENCY. 193 \"the Agency, little was said, as, when the money came, they could be called together in a day. I remained about one week there, visiting the farms and plantings, and issued to the Indians a good supply of pork, flour, powder, shot, and tobacco, and urged upon them the necessity of cutting and securing hay for the winter, and of watching and keeping the birds from their corn. days, and to send the chiefs and head men for a couned the next day, unarmed and peaceably and I would answer them. They assented and went to their camp. In the meantime I had sent for Captain Marsh, the commandant of Fort Ridgely, who promptly arrived early in the morning of the next day. \"I laid the whole case before him, and stated my plan. He agreed with me, and, in the after noon, the Indians, unarmed, and apparently peaceably disposed, came in, and we had a 'talk,' and, in the presence of Captain Marsh, Rev. Mr. Riggs and others, I agreed to issue the annuity goods and a fixed amount of provisions, provided the Indians would go home and watch their corn, and wait for the payment until they were sent for. They assented. I made, on the 6th, 7th and 8th of August the issues as agreed upon, assisted by Captain Marsh, and, on the 9th of August the In dians were ad gone, and on the 12th I had defi nite information that the Sissetons, who had started on the 7th, had all arrived at Big Stone Lake, and that the men were preparing to go on a buffalo hunt, and that the women and children were to stay and guard the crops. Thus this threatening and disagreeable event passed off, but, as usual, without the punishment of a single Indian who had been engaged in the attack on the warehouse. They should have been punished, but they were not, and simply because we had not the power to punish them. And hence we had to adopt the same 'sugar-plum' policy which had been so often adopted before with the Indians, and especially at the time of the Spirit Lake massacre, in 1857.\" \" I left them apparently satisfied, and arrived at Yedow Medicine on the 14th of July, and found, to my surprise, that nearly ad the Upper Indians had arrived, and were encamped about the Agency. I inquired of them why they had come, and they answered, that they were afraid something was wrong; they feared they would not get their money, because white men had been telling them so. \" Being in dady expectation of the arrival of the money, I determined to make the best of it. and notified the Superintendent of Indian Affairs accordingly. \"How were over 4,000 Annuity, and over 1,000 Yanktonais Sioux, with nothing to eat, and entirely dependent on me for supplies, to be provided for? I supplied them as best I could. Our stock was nearly used up, and still, on the 1st day of Au gust, no money had come. \" The Indians complained of starvation. I held back, in order to save the provisions to the last moment. On the 4th of August, early in the morning, the young men and soldiers, to the num ber of not less than four hundred mounted, and one hundred and fifty on foot, surprised and de ceived the commander of the troops on guard, and surrounded the camp, and proceeded to the warehouse in a boisterous manner, and in sight of, and within one hundred and fifty yards of one hundred armed men, with two twelve-pound mountain howitzers, cut down the door of the warehouse, shot down the American flag, and entered the building, and before they could be stopped had carried over one hundred sacks of flour from the warehouse, and were evi dently bent on a general 'clearing out.' On the 12th day of August, thirty men enlisted at Yellow Medicine; and, on the 13th, accompa nied by the agent, proceeded to the Lower Agency, where, on the 14th, they were joined by twenty more, making about fifty in all. On the afternoon of the 15th they proceeded to Fort Ridgely, where they remained until the morning of the 17th, when, having been furnished by Captain Marsh with transportation, accompanied by Lieutenant N. K. Cidver, Sergeant McGrew, and four men of Company B, Fifth Minnesota Volunteers, they started for Fort Snelling by the way of New Ulm and St. Peter, little dreaming of the terrible mes sage, the news of which would reach them at the latter place next day, and turn them back to the defense of that post and the border. \"The soldiers, now recovered from their panic, came gallantly to our aid, entered the warehouse and took possession. The Indians all stood around with their guns loaded, cocked and leveled. I spoke to them, and they consented to a talk. The result was, that they agreed, if I would give them plenty of pork and flour, and issue to them the annuity goods the next day, they would go away. I told them to go away with enough to eat for two On Monday morning, the 18th, at about 8 o'clock, they left New Ulm, and reached St. Peter 13"], [208, "194 HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. at about 4 o'clock P. M. About 6 o'clock, Mr. J. C. Dickinson arrived from the Lower Agency, bringing the startling news that the Indians had broken out, and, before he left, had commenced murdering the whites. ments, under Colonel McPhaid and Captain Anson Northrup and R. H. Chittenden arrived. The annuity money by Superintendent Thomp son had been dispatched to the Agency in charge of his clerk, accompanied by E. A. C. Hatch, J. C. Ramsey, M. A. Dady, and two or three others. They at once set about making preparations to return. There were in St. Peter some fifty old Harper's Ferry muskets; these they obtained, and, procuring ammunition, set about preparing cart ridges, at which many of them worked all night, and, at sunrise on Tuesday morning were on their way back, with heavy hearts and dark forebodings, toward the scene of trouble. On their arrival at the fort, on Tuesday night, Major Galbraith found these gentlemen there, they having arrived at the post Monday noon, the very day of the outbreak. Had they been one day sooner they would have been at the Lower Agency, and their names would have been added, in all probability, to the long roll of the victims, at that devoted point, of Indian barbarity, and about $10,000 in gold would have faden into the hands of the savages. In the night Sergeant Sturgis, of Captain Marsh's company, had arrived, on his way to St. Paul, with dispatches to Governor Ramsey, from Lieutenant Thomas Gere, then in command of Fort Ridgely, bringing the sad news of the des truction of Captain Marsh and the most of his command at the ferry, at the Lower Agency, on Monday afternoon. They had but a slender chance of reaching the fort in safety, and stid less of saving it from destruction, for they knew that there were not over twenty -five men left in it, Lieutenant Sheehan, with his company, having left for Fort Ripley on the 17th, at the same time that the \"Renville Rangers\" (the company from the Agencies) left for Fort Snelling. Their friends, too, were in the very heart of the Indian country. Some of them had left their wives and little ones at Yellow Medicine, midway between the Lower Agency and the wdd bands of the Sissetons and Yanktonais, who made the attack upon the ware house at that Agency only two weeks before. Their hearts almost died within them as they thought of the dreadful fate awaiting them at the hands of those savage and blood-thirsty monsters. But they turned their faces toward the West, de termined, if Fort Ridgely was yet untaken, to enter it, or die in the attempt, and at about sundown entered the fort, and found all within it as yet safe. These gentlemen were in the fort during the siege which followed, and were among the bravest of its brave defenders, Major Hatch, afterwards of \"Hatch's Battalion\" (cavalry), was particu lary conspicuous for his cool courage and undaunt ed bravery. Thus it will be seen how utterly false was the information which the Indians said they had re ceived that they were to get no money. And notwithstanding all that has been said as to the cause of the outbreak, it may be remarked that the removal of the agent from Yedow Medi cine, with the troops raised by him for the South ern Rebellion, at the critical period when the In dians were exasperated and excited, and ready at any moment to arm for warfare upon the whites, was one of the causes acting directly upon the In dians to precipitate the blow that afterwards fell upon the border settlements of Minnesota on the 18th of August, 1862. Had he remained with his family at Yellow Medicine, as did the Winnebago agent, with his family, at the agency, the strong probability is that the attack at Yellow Medicine might have been delayed, if not entirely pre vented. A messenger had been sent to Lieutenant Shee han, who immediately turned back and had enter ed the fort a few hours before them. There were in the fort, on their arrival, over two hundred and fifty refugees, principally women and children, and they continued to come in, untd there were nearly three hundred. CHAPTER XXXIH. MURDER AT ACTON MASSACRE AT THE LOWER AGENCY CAPTURE OF MATTIE WILLIAMS, MARY ANDERSON AND MARY SOHWANDT MURDER OF GEORGE GLEASON \u2014 CAPTURE OF MRS. WAKEFIELD AND CHILDREN. We come now to the massacre itself, the terrible Here they remained on duty, night and day, until the morning of the 28th, when reinforce- blow which fell, like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, with such appalling force and suddenness,"], [209, "MURDERS AT ACTON. 195 upon the unarmed and defenc3les3 border, crim soning its fair fields with the blood of its murdered people, and lighting up the midnight sky with the lurid blaze of burning dwellings, by the light of which the affrighted survivors fled from the nameless terrors that beset their path, before the advancing gleam of the uplifted tomahawk, many of them only to fall victims to the Indian bullet, while vainly seeking a place of security. ered, but was a silent witness of the tragic fate of his sister. After kdling the girl the savages left without disturbing anything, and going directly to the house of a settler, took from his stable a span of horses already in the harness, and whde the fam ily was at dinner, hitched them to a wagon stand ing near, and without molesting any one, drove off in the direction of Beaver Creek settlement and the Lower Agency, leaving Acton at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. This span of horses, har ness and wagon were the only property taken from the neighborhood by them. The first blow fed upon the town of Acton, thirty-five miles north-east of the Lower Sioux agency, in the county of Meeker. On Sunday, August 17, 1862, at 1 o'clock P. M., six Sioux In dians, said to be of Shakopee's band of Lower An nuity Sioux, came to the house of Jone3 and de manded food. It was refused them, as Mrs. Jones was away from home, at the house of Mr. Howard Baker, a son-in-law, three fourths of a mile dis tant. They became angry and boisterous, and fearing violence at their hands, Mr. Jones took his children, a boy and a girl, and went himself to Baker's, leaving at the house a girl from fourteen to sixteen years of age, and a boy of twelve \u2014 brother and sister \u2014 who lived with him. The In dians soon followed on to Baker's. At Howard Baker's were a Mr. Webster and his wife, Baker and wife and infant child, and Jones and his wife and two children. The boy at Jones's who escaped massacre at their hands, and who was at the house during the entire time that they were there, avers that they obtained no liquor there that day, but even that when they came back and murdered his sister, the bottles upon the shelf were untouched by them. They had obtained none on their first visit before going over to Baker's. It would seem, therefore, that the very general belief that these first mur ders at Acton, on the 17th, were the result of drunkenness, is a mistake. Mrs. Baker, who was unhurt by the fad, re mained in the cellar untd after the Indians were gone, when, taking the children, she started for a neighboring settlement, to give the alarm. Before she left, an Irishman, calling himself Cox, came to the house, whom she asked to go with her, and carry her child. Cox laughed, saying, \"the men were not dead, but drunk, and that, falling down, they had hurt their noses and made them bleed,\" and refusing to go with Mrs. Baker, went off in the direction taken by the Indians. This man Cox had frequently been seen at the Lower Agen cy, and was generady supposed to be an insane man, wandering friendless over the country. It has been supposed by many that he was in league with the Indians. We have only to say, if he was, he counterfeited insanity remarkably wed. Soon after reaching the house, the Indians pro posed to the three men to join them in target shooting. They consented, and all discharged their guns at the target. Mr. Baker then traded guns with an Indian, the savage giving him $3 as the difference in the value of the guns. Then all commenced loading again. The Indians got the charges into their guns first, and immediately turned and shot Jonas. Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Baker were standing in the door. When one of the savages leveled his gun at Mrs. Baker, her husband saw the movement, and sprang between them, receiving the budet intended for his wife in his own body. At the same time they shot Webster and Mrs. Jones. Mrs. Baker, who had her infant in her arms, seeing her husband fall, fainted, and fell backward into the cellar (a trap door being open), and thus escaped. Mrs. Web ster was lying in their wagon, from which the goods were not yet unloaded, and escaped unhurt. The children of Mr. Jones were in the house, and were not molested. They then returned to the house of Mr. Jones, and killed and scalped the girl. The boy was lying on the bed and was undiscov- Mrs. Baker reached the settlement in safety, and on the next day ( Monday) a company of citizens of Forest City, the county seat of Meeker county, went out to Acton to bury the dead. Forest City is twelve miles north of that place. The party who went out on Monday saw Indians on horse back, and chased them, but failed to get near enough to get a shot, and they escaped. As related in a preceding chapter, a council was held at Rice Creek on Sunday, at which it was de cided that the fearful tragedy should commence"], [210, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 196 on the next morning. It is doubtful whether the Acton murders were then known to these con spirators, as this couned assembled in the after noon, and the savages who committed those mur ders had some forty miles to travel, after 3 o'clock in the afternoon, to reach the place of this coun ed. It would seem, therefore, that those murders could have had no influence in precipitating this council, as they could not, at that time, have been known to Little Crow and his conspirators. either Mr. Prescott, Mr. Riggs, or Dr. Williamson, who had also been among them almost thirty years. Such was the position of these gentlemen that, had they discovered or suspected any lurking signs of a conspiracy, such as after developments satisfy us actuady existed, and had failed to com municate it to the authorities and the people, they would have laid themselves open to the horrible charge of complicity with the murderers. But whatever may be the public judgement upon the course afterward pursued by the two last-named gentlemen, in their efforts to shield the guflty wretches from that punishment their awful crimes so justly merited, no one who knows them would for a moment harbor a belief that they had any suspicion of the coming storm untd it burst upon them. The final decision of these fiends must have been made as early as sundown; for by early dawn al most the entire force of warriors, of the Lower tribes, were ready for the work of slaughter. They were already armed and painted, and dispersed through the scattered settlements, over a region at least forty mdes in extent, and were rapidly gath ering in the vicinity of the Lower Agency, until some 250 were codected at that point, and sur rounded the houses and stores of the traders, whde yet the inmates were at their morning meal, or asleep in their beds in fancied security, ad un conscious of the dreadful fate that awaited them. The action was concerted, and the time fixed. The blow was unexpected, and unparalleled! In the language as Adjutent-General Malmros: A stdl stronger proof of the feeling of security of these upon the reservation, and the belief that the recent demonstrations were only such as were of yearly occurrence, and that all danger was passed, is to be found in the fact that, as late as the 15th of August, the substance of a dispatch was published in the daily papers of St. Paul, from Major Galbraith, agreeing fully with the views of Mr. Riggs, as to the quiet and orderly conduct of the Indians. This opinion is accom panied by the very highest evidence of human sincerity. Under the belief of their peaceable disposition, he had, on the 16th day of August, sent his wde and children from Fort Ridgely to Yellow Medicine, where they arrived on Sunday, the 17th, the very day of the murders at Acton, and on the very day, also, that the couned at Rice Creek had decided that the white race in Minne sota must either perish or be driven back east of the Mississippi. But early on this fatal Monday morning Mr. Prescott and Rev. J. D. Hinman learned from Little Crow that the storm of savage wrath was gathering, and about to break upon their devoted heads, and that their only safety was in instant flight. \"Since the formation of our general Govern ment, no State or Territory of the Repubdc has received so severe a blow at the hands of the sav ages, or witnessed within its borders a paradel scene of murder, butchery, and rapine.\" Philander Prescott, the aged Government In terpreter at that Agency, who had resided among the Sioux for forty-five years, having a wde and children aided to them by ties of blood, and who knew their language and spoke it better than any man of their own race, and who seemed to under stand every Indian impulse, had not the slightest intimation or conception of such a catastrophe as was about to fall upon the country. The Rev. S. R. Riggs, in a letter to a St. Paul paper, under date of August 13, writes that \"all is quiet and orderly at the place of the forthcoming payment.\" This gentleman had been a missionary among these people for over a quarter of a century. His intimate acquaintance with their character and language were of such a nature as to enable him to know and detect the first symptoms of any in tention of committing any depredations upon the whites, and had not the greatest secrecy been ob served by them, the knowledge of their designs would undoubtedly have been communicated to The first crack of the Indian guns that fed on his ear, a moment afterward, found Prescott and Hinman, and his household fleeing for their dves, \"While on the billowy bosom of the air Rolled the dread notes of anguish and despair.\" Mrs. Hinman was, fortunately, then at Fari bault. All the other members of the family es caped wuh Mr. Hinman to Fort Ridgely. The slaughter at the Agency now commenced. John Lamb, a teamster, was shot down, near the house"], [211, "MASSACRE AT LOWER AGENCY. 197 of Mr. Hinman, just as that gentleman and his famdy were starting on their perilous journey of escape. At the same time some Indians entered the stable, and were taking therefrom the horses belonging to the Government. Mr. A. H. Wag ner, Superintendent of Farms at that Agency, en tered the stable to prevent them, and was, by order of Little Crow, instantly shot down. Mr. Hin man waited to see and hear no more, but fled toward the ferry, and soon put the Minnesota river between himself and the terrible tragedy enact ing behind him. In the mean time the work of death went on. The whites, taken by surprise, were utterly de fenseless, and so great had been the feeling of se curity, that many of them were actuady unarmed, although living in the very midst of the savages. At the store of Nathan Myrick, Hon. James W. Lynd, formerly a member of the State Senate, Andrew J. Myrick, and G. W.Divoll were dmong the first victims. * * * In the store of Wd liam H. Forbes were some five or six persons, among them Mr. George H. Spencer, jr. Hearing the yeding of the savages outside, these men ran to the door to ascertain its cause, when they were instantly fired upon, kdling four of their number, and severely wounding Mr. Spencer. Spencer and his uninjured companion hastily sought a tempo rary place of safety in the chamber of the budd ing. At about the same time, Mr. J. C. Dickinson, who kept the Government boarding-house, with all his family, including several girls who were working for him, also succeeded in crossing the river with a span of horses and a wagon; these, with some others, mostly women and chddren, who had reached the ferry, escaped to the fort. Mr. Spencer, in giring an account of this open ing scene of the awful tragedy, says: Very soon after, Dr. Philander P. Humphrey, physician to the Lower Sioux, with his sick wife, and three children, also succeeded in crossing the river, but never reached the fort. All but one, the eldest, a boy of about twelve years of age, were kdled upon the road. They had gone about four miles, when Mrs. Humphrey became so much exhausted as to be unable to pro ceed further, and they went into the house of a Mr. Magner, deserted by its inmates. Mrs. Hum phrey was placed on the bed; the son was sent to the spring for water for his mother. * * The boy heard the wild war-whoop of the savage break upon the stillness of the air, and, in the next moment, the ominous crack of their guns, which told the fate of his family, and left him its sole survivor. Fleeing hastily toward Fort Ridge ly, about eight mdes distant, he met the com mand of Captain Marsh on their way toward the Agency. The young hero turned back with them to the ferry. As they passed Magner's house, they saw the Doctor lying near the door, dead, but the house itself was a heap of smouldering ruins; and this brave boy was thus compelled to look upon the funeral pyre of his mother, and his little brother and sister. A burial party afterward found their charred remains amid the blackened ruins, and gave them Christian sepulture. In the charred hands of the little girl was found her china doll, with which she refused to part even in death. The boy went on to the ferry, and in that disas trous conflict escaped unharmed, and finally made his way into the fort. \" When I reached the foot of the stairs, I turned and beheld the store fiding with Indians. One had followed me nearly to the stairs, when he took deliberate aim at my body, but, providentiady, both barrels of his gun missed fire, and I succeeded in getting above without further injury. Not ex pecting to live a great while, I threw myself upon a bed, and, while lying there, coidd hear them opening cases of goods, and carrying them out, and threatening to burn the building. I did not relish the idea of being burned to death very wed, so I arose very quietly, and taking a bed-cord, I made fast one end to the bed-post, and carried the other to a window, which I raised. I intended, in case they fired the budding, to let myself down from the window, and take the chances of being shot again, rather than to remain where I was and burn. The man who went up-stairs with me, see ing a good opportunity to escape, rushed down through the crowd and ran for hfe; he was fired upon, and two charges of buckshot struck him, but he succeeded in making his escape. I had been up-stairs probably an hour, when I heard the voice of an Indian inquiring for me. I recognized his voice, and felt that I was safe. Upon being told that I was up-stairs, he rushed up, fodowed by ten or a dozen others, and approaching my bed, asked if I was mortally wounded. I told him that I did not know, but that I was badly hurt. Some of the others came up and took me by the hand, and appeared to be sorry that I had been hurt. They then asked me where the guns were. I"], [212, "198 HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. pointed to them, when my comrade assisted me in getting down stairs. urbane manners and strict attention to their in terests, secured the personal friendship of many of the tribe. Mr. Nairn and his family reached the fort in safety that afternoon. Mr. Hunter had, some years before, frozen his feet so badly as to lose the toes, and, being lame, walked with great difficulty. When near an Indian vdlage below the Agency, they were met by an Indian, who urged Hunter to go to the vdlage, promising to get them a horse and wagon with which to make their es cape. Mr. Hunter and his wife went to the Indian village, believing their Indian friend would re deem his promises, but from inabidty, or some other reason, he did not do so. They went to the woods, where they remained ad night, and in the morning started for Fort Ridgely on foot. They had gone but a short distance, however, when they met an Indian, who, without a word of warning, shot poor Hunter dead, and led his distracted young wife away into captivity. \" The name of this Indian is Wakinyatawa, or, in English, 'His Thunder.' He was, up to the time of the outbreak, the head soldier of Little Crow, and, some four or five years ago, went to Wash ington with that chief to see their Great Father. He is a fine-looking Indian, and has always been noted for his bravery in fighting the Chippewas. When we reached the foot of the stairs, some of the Indians cried out, 'Kill him!' 'Spare no Americans!' 'Show mercy to none!' My friend, who was unarmed, seized a hatchet that was lying near by, and declared that he would cut down the first one that should attempt to do me any further harm. Said he, ' If you had killed him before I saw him, it would have been ad right; but we have been friends and comrades for ten years, and now that I have seen him, I will protect him or die with him.' They then made way for us, and we passed out; he procured a wagon, and gave me over to a couple of squaws to take me to his lodge. On the way we were stopped two or three times by armed Indians on horseback, who inquired of the squaws ' What that meant ?' Upon being answered that ' This is Wakinyatawa's friend, and he has saved his life,' they suffered us to pass on. His lodge was about four miles above the Agency, at Little Crow's village. My friend soon came home and washed me, and dressed my wounds with roots. Some few white men succeeded in making their escape to the fort. There were no other white men taken prisoners.\" We now return once more to the scene of blood and conflagration at the Agency. The white haired interpreter, Phdander Prescott (now verg ing upon seventy years of age), hastily left his house soon after his meeting with Little Crow, and fled toward Fort Ridgely. The other members of his famdy remained behind, knowing that their relation to the tribe would save them. Mr. Pres cott had gone several miles, when he was overtaken. His murderers came and talked with him. He reasoned with them, saying: \"I am an old man: I have lived with you now forty-five years, almost half a century. My wife and children are among you, of your own blood; I have never done you any harm, and have been your true friend in ad your troubles; why should you wish to kid me?\" Their only reply was: \"We would save your life d we could, but the white man must die; we cannot spare your life; our orders are to kill ad white men; we cannot spare you.\" The relation of \"comrade,\" which existed be tween Mr. Spencer and this Indian, is a species of Freemasonry which is in existence among the Sioux, and is probably also common to other In dian tribes. The store of Louis Robert was, in like manner, attacked. Patrick McClellan, one of the clerks in charge of the store, was killed, There were at the store several other persons; some of them were killed and some made their escape. Mr. John Nairn, the Government carpenter at the Lower Sioux Agency, seeing the attack upon the stores and other places, seized his children, four in num ber, and, with his wife, started out on the prairie, making their way toward the fort. They were aecompanied by Mr. Alexander Hunter, an at tached personal friend, and his young wife. Mr. Nairn had been among them in the employ of the Government, some eight years, and had, by his Seeing that all remonstrance was vain and hope less, and that his time had come, the aged man with a firm step and noble bearing, sadly turned away from the deaf ear and iron heart of the sav age, and with dignity and composure received the fatal messenger. Thus perished Phdander Prescott, the true, tried, and faithful friend of the Indian, by the hands of that perfidious race, whom he had so long and so faithfudy labored to benefit to so dttle purpose. The number of persons who reached Fort Ridge ly from the agency was forty-one. Some are"], [213, "AT REDWOOD RIVER. 199 known to have reached other places of safety. All suffered incredible hardships; many hiding by day in the tall prairie grass, in bogs and sloughs, or under the trunks of prostrate trees, crawling stealthily by night to avoid the lurking and wdy foe, who, with the keen scent of the blood-hound and ferocity of the tiger, fodowed on their trail, thirsting for blood. REDWOOD RIVER. At the Redwood river, ten mdes above the Agency, on the road to Yedow Medicine, resided Mr. Joseph B. Reynolds, in the employment of the Government as a teacher. His house was within one mde of Shakopee's vidage. His family consisted of his wife, a niece \u2014 Miss Mattie Wd liams, of Painesville, Ohio \u2014 Mary Anderson and Mary Schwandt, hired girls. William Landmeier, a hired man, and Legrand Davis, a young man from Shakopee, was also stopping with them tem porarily. Among those who escaped into the fort were Mr. J. C. Whipple, of Faribault; Mr. Charles B. Hewitt, of New Jersey. The services of Mr. Whipple were recognized and rewarded by the Government with a first lieutenant's commis sion in the volunteer artidery service. On the morning of the 18th of August, at about 6 o'clock, John Moore, a half-breed trader, resid ing near them, came to the house and informed them that there was an outbreak among the In dians, and that they had better leave at once. Mr. Reynolds immediately got out his buggy, and, taking his wife, started off across the prairie in such a direction as to avoid the Agency. At the same time Davis and the three girls got into the wagon of a Mr. Patode, a trader at Yedow Medi cine, who had just arrived there on his way to New Ulm, and they also started out on the prairie. Widiam, the hired man, would not leave until he had been twice warned by Moore that his hfe was in danger. He then went down to the river bot tom, and following the Minnesota river, started for the fort. When some distance on his way he came upon some Indians who were gathering up cattle. They saw him and there was no way of escape. They came to him and told him that if he would assist them in driving the cattle they would not kdl him. Making a merit of necessity he complied, and went on with them till they were near the Lower Agency, when the Indians, hear ing the firing at the ferry, suddenly left him and hastened on to take part in the battle then pro gressing between Captain Marsh and their friends. William fled in an opposite direction, and that night entered Fort Ridgely. < James Powell, a young man residing at St. Peter, was at the Agency herding cattle. He had just turned the cattle out of the yard, saddled and mounted his mule, as the work of death com menced. Seeing Lamb and Wagner shot down near him he turned to flee, when Lamb caded to him for help; but, at that moment two shots were fired at him, and, putting spurs to his mule he turned toward the ferry, passing close to an In dian who leveled his gun to fire at him ; but the caps exploded, when the savage, evidently sur prised that he had failed to kill him, waved his hand toward the river, and exclaimed, \"Puckachee! Puckachee!\" Pcwell did not wait for a second warning, which might come in a more unwelcome form, but slipped at once from the back of his an imal, dashed down the bluff through the brush, and reached the ferry just as the boat was leaving the shore. Looking over his shoulder as he ran, he saw an Indian in full pursuit on the very mule he had a moment before abandoned. All that day the work of sack and plunder went on; and when the stores and dwellings and the warehouses of the Government had been emptied of their contents, the torch was applied to the var ious buddings, and the little village was soon a heap of smouldering ruins. The bodies of their slain victims were left to fes ter in the sun where they fell, or were consumed in the buildings from which they had been unable to effect their escape. We return now to Patode and his party. After crossing the Redwood near its mouth, he drove some distance up that stream, and, turning to the left, struck across the prairie toward New Ulm, keeping behind a swed in the prairie which ran parallel with the Minnesota, some three mdes south of that stream. So complete was the surprise, and so sudden and unexpected the terrible blow, that not a sin gle one of all that host of naked savages was slain. In thirty minutes from the time the first gun was fired, not a white person was left alive. All were either weltering in their gore or had fled in fear and terror from that place of death. They had, unpursued, and apparently unob served, reached a point within about ten miles of New Ulm, and nearly opposite Fort Ridgely, when they were suddenly assaded by Indians, who"], [214, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 200 killed Patode and Davis, and severely wounded Mary Anderson. Miss Williams and Mary Schwandt were captured unhurt, and were taken back to Waucouta's village. never wronged in word or deed. Some weeks af terward, his mutdated remains were found by the troops under Colonel Sibley, and buried where he fed. They were subsequently removed by his friends to Shakopee, where they received the rites of Christian sepulture. The poor, injured young woman survived her wounds and the brutal and fiendish violation of her person to which she was subjected by these devils incarnate, but a few days, when death, in mercy, came to her redes and ended her sufferings in the quiet of the grave! Mrs. Wakefield and chddren were held as pris oners, and were reclaimed with the other captives at Camp Release. Mattie Williams and Mary Schwandt were af terwards restored to their friends by General Sib ley's expedition, at Camp Release. We say, res stored to their friends; this was hardly true of Mary Schwandt, who, when release came, found alive, of ad her father's family, only one, a little brother; and he had witnessed the fiendish slaugh ter of ad the rest, accompanied by circumstances of infernal barbarity, without a paradel in the his tory of savage brutaflty.

On Sunday, the 17th, George Gleason, Govern ment store-keeper at the Lower Agency, accompa nied by the family of Agent Galbraith, to Yedow Medicine, and on Monday afternoon, ignorant of the terrible tragedy enacted below, started to re turn. He had with him the wife and two chddren of Dr. J. S. Wakefield, physician to the Upper Sioux. When about two mdes above the mouth of the Redwood, they met two armed Indians on the road. Gleason greeted them with the usual salutation of \"Ho!\" accompanied with the inquiry, in Sioux, as he passed, \"Where are you going ?\" They returned the salutation, but Gleason had gone but a very short distance, when the sharp crack of a gun behind him bore to his ear the first intimation of the death in store for him. The budet passed through his body and he fed to the ground. At the same moment Chaska, the Indian who had not fired, sprang into the wagon, by the side of Mrs. Wakefield, and driving a short dis tance, returned. Poor Gleason was lying upon the ground, still alive, writhing in mortal agony, when the savage monster completed his hellish work, by placing his gun at his breast, and shoot ing him again. Such was the sad end of the hfe of George Gleason; gay, jocund, genial and gen erous, he was the hfe of every circle. His pleas ant face was seen, and his medow voice was heard in song, at almost every social gathering on that rude frontier. He had a smile and pleasant word for all; and yet he fed, in his manly strength, by the hands of these bloody monsters, whom he had Early on the morning of the 18th, the settlers on the north side of the Minnesota river, adjoining the reservation, were surprised to see a large num ber of Indians in their immediate neighborhood. They were seen soon after the people arose, simul taneously, ad along the river from Birch Coolie to Beaver Creek, and beyond, on the west, apparent ly intent on gathering up the horses and cattle. When interrogated, they said they were after Chippewas. At about 6 or 7 o'clock they sudden ly began to repair to the various houses of the set tlers, and then the flight of the inhabitants and the work of death began. In the immediate vicinity of Beaver Creek, the neighbors, to the number of about twenty-eight, men, women, and children, assembled at the house of Jonathan W. Earle, and, with several teams, started for Fort Ridgely, having with them the sick wife of S. R. Henderson, her chddren, and the famdy of N. D. White, and the wde and two chddren of James Carrothers. There were, also, David Carrothers and famdy, Earle and famdy, Henderson, and a German named Wedge, besides four sons of White and Earle; the rest were women and chddren. They had gone but a short distance when they were surrounded by Indians. When asked, by some of the party who could speak their language, what they wanted, the Indians answered, \"We are going to kid you.\""], [215, "MASSACRE AT GERMAN SETTLEMENT. 201 When asked why they were to be killed, the In dians consented to let them go, with one team and the buggy with Mrs. Henderson, on giving up the rest. They had gone but a short distance when they were again stopped by the savages, and the remaining team taken. Again they moved on, drawing the buggy and the sick woman by hand> but had gone but a few rods further, when the In dians began to fire upon them. The men were with the buggy ; the women and children had gone on ahead, as wed as the boys and Carrothers. emigrants, numbering some forty persons, quiet, industrious, and enterprising. Early on the morning of the 18th these had ad assembled at the house of John Meyer. Very soon after they had assembled here, some fifty Indians, led by Shakopee, appeared in sight. The people ad fled, except Meyer and his family, going into the grass and bushes. Peter Bjorkman ran toward his own house. Shakopee, whom he knew, saw him, and exclaimed, \"There is Bjorkman; kid him!\" but, keeping the building between him and the sav ages, he plunged into a slough and concealed himself, even removing his shirt, fearing it might be the means of revealing his whereabouts to the lurking savages. Here he lay from early morning until the darkness of night enabled him to leave with safety \u2014 suffering unutterable torments, mos quitoes literady swarming upon his naked person, and the hot sun scorching him to the bone. Mr. Earle, seeing the savages were determined to kill them, and knowing that they could not now save Mrs. Henderson, hastened on and came up with the fleeing fugitives ahead. Mr. Henderson waved a white cloth as a flag of truce, when they shot off his fingers, and, at the same time, kdled Wedge. Henderson then ran, seeing that he could not save his wde and children, and made his es cape. They came up with his buggy, and, taking out the helpless woman and chddren, threw them on the prairie, and placing the bed over them, set it on fire, and hastened on after the fleeing fugi tives. They immediately attacked the house of Meyer, killing his wife and ad his chddren. Seeing his family butchered, and having no means of de fense, Meyer effected his escape, and reached Fort Ridgely. In the meantime the affrighted people had got together again at the house of a Mr. Sitzton, near Bjorkman's, to the number of about thirty, men, women, and children. In the after noon the savages returned to the house of Sitzton, kildng every person there but one woman, Mrs. Wilhelmina Eindenfield, and her child. These were captured, and afterward found at Camp Re lease, but the husband and father was among the slain. From his place of concealment Mr. Bjork man witnessed this attack and wholesale massacre of almost an entire neighborhood. After dark he came out of the slough, and, going to his house, obtained some food and a bundle of clothing, as his house was not yet plundered; fed his dog and calf, and went over to the house of Meyer; here he found the windows all broken in, but did not enter the house. He then went to the house of Sitzton; his nerves were not equal to the task of entering that charnel-house of death. As he passed the yard, he turned out some cattle that the Indians had not taken away, and hastened toward Fort Ridgely. On the road he overtook a woman and two children, one an infant of six months, the wife and children of John Sateau, who had been killed. Taking one of the children in his arms, these companions in misfortune and suffer ing hurried on together. Mrs. Sateau was nearly naked, and without either shoes or stockings. The burned and blackened remains of both the mother and her two children were afterward found by a burial party, and interred. Coming up with the escaping women and chil dren, they were all captured but two chddren of David Carrothers. These they had shot in the chase after Carrothers, Earle, and the sons of Earle and White. They kided, also, during this chase and running fight, Eugene White, a son of N. D. White, and Radner, son of Jonathan W. Earle. Carrothers escaped to Crow River, and thence to St. Paul. Mr. Earle and two of his sons, and one son of Mr. White, after incredible hardships, es caped to Cedar City, and subsequently made their way back to St. Peter and Fort Ridgely. All the captives taken at this time were carried to Crow's village, and, with the exception of Mrs. James Carrothers and her children, were recovered at Camp Release. After they had captured the women and children, they returned to the houses of the settlers, and plundered them of their contents, carrying off what they could, and breaking up and destroying the balance. They then gathered up the stock and drove it to their village, taking their captives with them.

The rough prairie grass lacerated her naked feet and limbs terribly, and she was about giving out in despair. Bjorkman took from his bundle a shirt, arid tearing it in parts, she wound it about her feet, and proceeded on. again, on the lower side of the road, and staid there untd sundown. \"While I lay here concealed, I saw the Indians taking the roof off the warehouse, and saw the buddings burning at the Agency. I also heard the thing during the battle at the ferry, when Marsh and his men were killed. At dayhght they came in sight of the house of Magner, eight mdes above the fort. Here they saw some eight or ten Indians, and, turning aside from the road, dropped down into the grass, where they remained untd noon, when the Indians disap peared. They again moved toward the fort, but slowly and cautiously, as they did not reach it until about midnight. Upon reaching the fort Mrs. Sateau found two sons, aged ten and twelve years respectively, who had effected their escape and reached there before her. \"I then went up near the fort road, and sitting down under a tree, waited till dark, and then started for Fort Rjdgely, carrying my child ad the way. I arrived at the fort at about 1 o'clock A. M. The distance from our place to Ridgley was seventeen miles. \"On Tuesday morning I saw John Magner, who told me that, when- the soldiers went up to the Agen cy the day before, he saw my husband lying in the road, near David Faribault's house, dead. John Hayden, his brother, who lived with us, was found dead near La Croix creek. They had got up the oxen, and were bringing the famdy of Mr. Eisen rich to the fort, when they were overtaken by In dians. Eisenrich was killed and his wife and five children were taken prisoners. Mrs. Mary, widow of Patrick Hayden, who re sided about one and a half mdes from the house of J. W. Earle, near Beaver Creek, in Renvdle county, says: \"On the morning of the 18th of August, Mr. Hayden started to go over to the house of Mr. J. B. Reynolds, at the Redwood river, on the reser vation, and met Thomas Robinson, a half-breed, who told him to go homo, get his family, and leave as soon as possible, for the Indians were coming over to kid all the whites. He came im mediately home, and we commenced to make preparations to leave, but in a few minutes we saw some three or four Indians coming on horse back. We then went over to the house of a neighbor, Benedict Eune, and found them all ready to leave. I started off with Eune's people, and my husband went back home, still thinking the Indians would not kill any one, and intending to give them some provisions if they wanted them. I never saw him again. \"Mrs. Zimmerman, who was blind, and her re maining children, and Mrs. Eune and her children, five in number, were captured and taken to the house of David Faribault, where they were kept till night, the savages torturing them by teding them that they were going to fasten them in the house and burn them alive, but for some inexpli cable reason let them go, and they, too, reached the fort in safety. Mr. Eune, who with one of his boys, eleven years old, remained behind to drive in his cattle, was met by them on the road and killed. The boy was captured, and, with the other prisoners, recovered at Camp Release.\" The neighborhoods in the vicinity of La Croix creek, and between that and Fort Ridgely, were visited on Monday forenoon, and the people either massacred, driven away or made prisoners. Ed ward Magner, living eight miles above the fort, was kided. His wde and children had gone to the fort. He had returned to look after his cat tle when he was shot. Patrick Kelley anel David O'Connor, both single men, were killed near Mag ner's. \"We had gone about four miles, when we saw a man lying dead in the road and his faithful dog watching by his side. \"We drove on tid we came to the house of David Faribault, at the foot of the hill, about one and a half miles from the Agency ferry. When we got here two Indians came out of Faribault's house, and stopping the teams, shot Mr. Zimmerman, who was driving, and his two boys. I sprang out or the wagon, and, with my chdd, one year old, in my arms, ran into the bushes, and went up the hill toward the fort. When I came near the house of Mr. Magner, I saw Indians throwing furniture out of the door, and I went down into the bushes Kearn Horan makes the following statement. \"I lived four miles from the Lower Sioux Agency, on the fort road.

WTe saw Indians in the road near Magner's. Thomas Smith went to them, thinking they were white men, and I saw them kill him. We then turned to flee, and saw men escaping with teams along the road. All fled towards the fort together, the Indians firing upon us as we ran. The teams were oxen, and the In dians were gaining upon us, when one of men in his excitement dropped his gun. The savages came up to it and picked it up. All stopped to examine it, and the men in the wagons whipped the oxen into a run. This delay enabled us to elude them. until he had, with his own hands, buried his mur dered wife and also a Mr. Pigiiar. A flourishing German settlement had sprung up near Patterson's Rapids, on the Sacred Heart, twelve mdes below Yedow Medicine. Word came to this neighborhood about sun down of the 18th, that the Indians were murder ing the whites. This news was brought to them by two men who had started from the Lower Agency, and had seen the lifeless and mutilated remains of the murdered victims lying upon the road and in their plundered dwellings towards Beaver Creek. The whole neighborhood, with the exception of one family, that of Mr. Schwandt, soon assembled at the house of Paul Kitzman, with their oxen and wagons, and prepared to start for Fort Ridgely. \"As we passed the house of Ole Sampson, Mrs. Sampson was crying at the door for help. Her three children were with her. We told her to go into the bush and hide, for we could not help her. We ran into a ravine and hid in the grass. After the Indians had hunted some time for us, they came along the side of the ravine, and called to us in good English, saying, 'Come out, boys; what are you afraid of? We don't want to hurt you.' After they left us we crawled out and made our way to the fort, where we arrived at about 4 o'clock P. M. My family had gone there before me. Mrs. Sampson did not go to the bush, but hid in the wagon from which they had recently come from Waseca county. It was what we call a prairie schooner, covered with cloth, a genuine emigrant wagon. They took her babe from her, and throwing it down upon the grass, put hay un der the wagon, set fire to it and went away. Mrs. Sampson got out of the wagon, badly burned, and taking her infant from the ground made he: w y to the fort. Two of her children were burned to death in the wagon. Mr. Sampson had been pre viously killed about eighty rods from the house. A messenger was sent to the house of Schwandt but the Indian rifle and the tomahawk had done their fearful work. Of ad that family but two survived; one a boy, a witness of the awful scene of butchery, and he then on his way, covered with blood, towards Fort Ridgely. The other, a young girl of about seventeen years of age, then residing at Redwood, who was captured as previously stated. This boy saw his sister, a young married wo man, ripped open, whde alive, and her unborn babe taken, yet struggling, from her person and nailed to a tree before the eyes of the dying mother. This party started in the evening to make their escape, going so as to avoid the settlements and the traveled roads, striking across the country to ward the head of Beaver creek. They traveled this way ad night, and in the morning changed their course towards Fort Ridge ly. They continued in this direction untd the sun was some two hours high, when they were met by eight Sioux Indians, who told them that the murders were committed by Chippewas, and that they had come over to protect them and punish the murderers; and thus induced them to turn back toward their homes. One of the savages spoke English wed. He was acquainted with some of the company, having often hunted with Paul Kitzman. He kissed Kitzman, telling him he was a good man; and they shook hands with ad of the party. The simple hearted Germans believed them, gave them food, distributed money among them, and, gratefully receiving their assurances of friendship and protection, turned back. In the neighborhood of La Croix creek, or Birch Coode, Peter Pereau, Frederick Closen, Piguar, Andrew Bahlke, Henry Keartner, old Mr. Closen and Mrs. Widiam Vitt, and several others were killed. Mrs. Maria Frorip, an aged Ger man woman, was wounded four different times with small shot, but escaped to the fort. The wife of Henry Keartner also escaped and reached the fort. The wife and child of a Mr. Cardenelle were taken prisoners, as were also the wife and child of Frederick Closen. Wdliam Vitt came into Fort Ridgely, but not"], [218, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 204 They traveled on toward their deserted homes tid noon, when they again halted, and gave their pretended protectors food. The Indians went away by themselves to eat. The suspicions of the fugitives were now somewhat aroused, but they felt that they were, to a great extent, in the power of the wretches. They soon came back, and or dered them to go on, taking their position on each side of the train. Soon after they went on and disappeared. The train kept on toward home; and when within a few rods of a house, where they thought they could defend themselves, as they had guns with them, they were suddenly surrounded by fourteen Indians, who instantly fired upon them, killing eight (all but three of the men) at the first discharge. At the next fire they killed two of the remaining men and six of the women, leaving only one man, Frederick Kreiger, adve. His wife was also, as yet, unhurt. They soon dispatched Kreiger, and, at the same time, began beating out the brains of the screaming chddren with the butts of their guns. Mrs. Kreiger was standing in the wagon, and, when her husband fell, attempted to spring from it to the ground, but was shot from behind, and fed back in the wagon-box, although not dead, or entirely unconscious. She was roughly seized and dragged to the ground, and the teams were driven off. She now became insensible. A few of the children, during this awful scene, escaped to the timber near by ; and a few also, maimed and mangled by these horrible monsters, and left for dead, survived, and, after enduring incredible hardships, got to Fort Ridgely. Mrs. Zable, and five children, were horribly mangled, and almost naked, entered the fort eleven days afterward- Mrs. Kreiger also survived her unheard-of suffer- tions. As night approached, however, an unusual gathering of Indians was observed on the hid just west of the Agency, and between it and the- house of John Other Day. Judge Givens and Charles Crawford, then acting as interpreters in the ab sence of Freniere, went out to them, and sought to learn why they were there in couned, but could get no satisfactory reply. Soon after this, Other Day came to them with the news of the outbreak below, as did also Joseph Laframbois, a half breed Sioux. The famdies there were soon all gathered together in the warehouse and dwelling of the agent, who resided in the same building, and with the guns they had, prepared themselves as best they could, and awaited the attack, deter mined to sed their lives as dearly as possible. There were gathered here sixty-two persons, men, women, and children. Other Day, and several other Indians, who came to them, told them they would stand by them to the last. These men visited the council outside, several times during the night; but when they were most needed, one only, the noble and heroic Other Day, remained faithful. Ad the others dis appeared, one after another, during the night. About one or two o'clock in the morning, Stewart B. Garvie, connected with the traders' store, known as Myrick's, came to the warehouse, and was ad mitted, badly wounded, a charge of buckshot hav ing entered his bowels. Garvie was standing in the door or his store when he was fired upon and wounded. He ran up stairs, and jumping from the window into the garden, crawled away, and reached the Agency without further molestation. At about this time Joseph Laframbois went to the store of Daily & Pratt, and awakened the two men in charge there, Duncan R. Kennedy and J. D. Boardman, and told them to flee for their hves. They hastily dressed and left the store, but had not gone ten rods when they saw in the path be fore them three Indians. They stepped down from the path, which ran along the edge of a rise in the ground of some feet, and crouching in the grass, the Indians passed within eight feet of them. Kennedy went on toward Fort Ridgely, determined to reach that post if possible, and Boardman went to the warehouse. At the store of Widiam H. Forbes, Constans, book-keeper, a na tive of France, was kided. At the store of Pa tode, Peter Patode, clerk, and a nephew of the proprietor, was shot just outside the store, the ball entering at the back and coming cat near the nip- ings. Some forty odd bodies were afterward found and buried on that fatal field of slaughter. Thus per ished, by the hands of these terrible scourges of the border, almost an entire neighborhood. Quiet, sober, and industrious, they had come hither from the vine-clad hids of their fatherland, by the green shores and gliding waters of the enchanting Rhine, and had budt for themselves homes, where they had fondly hoped, in peace and quiet, to spiend yet long years, under the fair, blue sky, and in the sunny clime of Minnesota, when suddenly, and in one short hour, by the hand of the savage, they were doomed to one common annihilation. During all the fatal 18th of August, the people at the Upper Agency pursued their usual avoca-"], [219, "WHITES RESCUED BY OTHER DAY. 205 pie, passing through his lungs. An Indian came to him after he fed, turned him over, and saying, \"He is dead,\" left him. some days before deserted their farms, and had now returned to look after their crops and cattle. He now learned for the first time where he was. He had struck a settlement far up the Sauk Val ley, some forty mdes above St. Cloud. He must have wandered, in these twelve days of suffering, not less than two hundred miles, including devia tions from a direct course. They then turned their attention to the stores. The clerks in the store of Louis Robert had effect ed their escape, so that there were now no white men left, and when they had become absorbed in the work of plunder, Patode crawled off into the bushes on the banks of the Yellow Medicine, and secreted himself. Here he remained all day. After dark he got up and started for a place of safety; ascending the bluff, out of the Yedow Med icine bottom, he dragged himself a mile and a half further, to the Minnesota, at the mouth of the Yedow Medicine. Wading the Minnesota, he entered the house of Louis Labede, on the oppo site side, at the ford. It was deserted. Finding a bed in the house he lay down upon it and was soon fast asleep, and did not awake untd morning. Joseph Laframbois and Narces Freniere, and an Indian, Makacago, entered the house, and finding him there, awoke him, telling him there were hos tile Indians about ; that he must hide. They gave him a blanket to disguise himself, and going with him to the ravine, concealed him in the grass and left him, promising to return, as soon as it was safe to do so, to bring him food, and guide him away to the prairie. He lay in this ravine until toward night, when his friends, true to their promise, returned, bringing some crackers, tripe, and onions. They went with him some distance out on the prairie, and enjoined upon him not to attempt to go to Fort Ridgely, and giving him the best directions they could as to the course he should take, shook hands with him and left him. Their names should be inscribed upon tablets more enduring than brass. That night he slept on the prairie, and the next day resumed his wanderings, over an unknown region, without an inhabitant. After wandering for days without food or drink, his little stock of crackers and tripe being exhaust ed, he came to a deserted house, which he did not know. Here he remained all night, and obtained two raw potatoes and three ears of green corn. These he ate raw. It was ad the food he had for eight days. Wandering, and unknowing whither to go, on the twelfth day out from Labelle's house, he heard the barking of dogs, and creeping nearer to them, stid fearing there might be Indians about, he was overjoyed at seeing white men. Soon making himself and his condition known, he was taken and kindly cared for by these men, who had He was taken by these men, in a wagon, to St. Cloud, where his wound was dressed for the first time. From St. Cloud the stage took him to St. Anthony, where he took the cars to St. Paul. A case of equal suffering and equal eudurance is scarcely to be found on record. With a bullet wound through the lungs, he walked twelve days, not over a smooth and easy road, but across a trackless prairie, covered with rank grass, wading sloughs and streams on his way, almost without food, and for days without water, before he saw the face of a man; and traveled by wagon, stage, and cars, over one hundred miles. His recovery was rapid, and he soon enlisted in the First Regiment Minnesota Mounted Rangers under General Sibley, in the expedition against the Sioux. Patode was in the battles on the Mis souri in the summer of 1863, where his company, that of Captain Joseph Anderson, is mentioned as having fought with great bravery. We now return to the warehouse at Yellow Med icine, which we left to follow the strange fortunes of young Patode. Matters began to wear a seri ous aspect, when Garvie came to them mortally wounded. Other Day was constantly on the watch outside, and reported the progress of affairs to those within. Toward daylight every friendly Indian had deserted save Other Day; the yells of the savages came distinctly to their ears from the trading-post, half a mile distant. They were ab sorbed in the work of plunder. The chances of escape were sadly against them, yet they decided to make the attempt. Other Day knew every foot of the country over which they must pass, and would be their guide. The wagons were driven to the door. A bed was placed in one of them; Garvie was laid upon it. The women and children provided a few loaves of bread, and just as day dawned, the cortege started on its perilous way. This party consisted of the family of Major Galbraith, wife and three children; Nelson Givens, wde, and wife's mother, and three children ; Noah Sinks, wife, and two chd dren; Henry Eschede, wife, and five children; John"], [220, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 206 Fadden, wife, and three children; Mr. German and wife; Frederick Patode, wife, and two children; Mrs. Jane K.

He died there, a day or two afterward. Some of the company, who were so worn out as to be unable to go on be yond Hutchinson, returned to Cedar City and saw that he was decently interred. On Thursday they went on, by way of Hutchin son and Glencoe, to Carver, and thence to Shako pee and St. Paul. Major Galbraith, in a report to the department, says of this escape : They crossed the Minnesota at Labelle's farm, and soon turned into the timber on the Hawk river, crossed that stream at some distance above its mouth, and ascended from the narrow valley through which it runs to the open prairie beyond, and followed down the Minnesota, keeping back on the prairie as far as the farm of Major J. R. Brown, eight miles below the Yellow Medicine. Mr. Fadden and Other Day visited the house and found it deserted. A consultation then took place, for the purpose of deciding where they should go. Some of them wished to go to Fort Ridgely; oth ers to some town away from the frontier. Other Day told them that if they attempted to go to the fort they would all be killed, as the Indians would either be lying in ambush on that road for them, or would follow them, believing they would at tempt to go there. His counsel prevailed, and they turned to the left, across the prairie, in the direction of Kandiyohi Lakes and Glencoe. At night one of the party mounted a horse and rode forward, and found a house about a mile ahead. They hastened forward and reached it in time to escape a furious storm. They were kindly re ceived by the only person about the premises, a man, whose family were away. The next morn ing, soon after crossing Hawk river, they were joined by Louis Labelle and Gertong, his son-in law, who remained with them all that day. \"Led by the Noble Other Day, they struck out on the naked prairie, literally placing their lives in this faithful creature's hands, and guided by him, and him alone. After intense suffering and privation, they reached Shakopee, on Friday, the 22d of August, Other Day never leaving them for an instant; and this Other Day is a pure, full blooded Indian, and was, not long since, one of the wildest and fiercest of his race. Poor, noble fel low ! must he, too, be ostracized for the sins of his nation ? 1 commend him to the care of a just God and a liberal government; and not only him, but all others who did likewise.\" [Government gave John Other Day a farm in Minnesota. He died several years since univer sally esteemed by the white people.] After a knowledge of the designs of the Indians reached the people at the Agency, it was impossi ble for them to more than merely communicate with the two families at the saw-mill, three miles above, and with the families nt the Mission. They were, therefore, reluctantly left to their fate. Early in the evening of Monday, two civilized In dians, Chaskada and Tankanxaceye, went to the house of Dr. Williamson, and warned them of their danger, informing them of what had occurred be low; and two half-breeds, Michael and Gabriel Renvdle, and two Christian Indians, Paul Maxa kuta Mani and Simon Anaga Mani, went to the house of Mr. Riggs, the missionary, at Hazel wood, and gave them warning of the danger im pending over them. On Wednesday morning they left the house of the friendly settler, and that night reached Cedar City, eleven mdes from Hutchinson, in the county of McLeod. The inhabitants had deserted the town, and gone to an island, in Cedar Lake, and hai erected a rude shelter. From the main land the island was reached through shallow water. Through this water our escaping party drove, guided by one of the citizens of Cedar City, and were cordially welcomed by the people assembled there. There were at this place, at that time, the family of the Rev. Stephen R. Riggs, Mr. H. D. Cun ningham and family, Mr. D. W. Moore and his wife (who reside in New Jersey), and Jonas Petti john and family. Mr. Pettijohn and wife were in charge of the Government school at Red Iron's village, and were now at Mr. Riggs'. They got up a team, and these friendly Indians went with them to an Island in the Minnesota, about three That night it rained, and ad were drenched to the skin.

Here they remained till Tuesday evening. In the afternoon of Tuesday, Andrew Hunter, a son-in-law of Dr. Williamson, came to him with the information that the family of himself and the Doctor were secreted below. The families at the saw-mill had been informed by the Renvdles, and were with the party of Dr. Wil- liamson. At night they formed a junction on the north side of the Minnesota, and commenced their perilous journey. A thunder-storm effectually ob- literated their tracks, so that the savages could not follow them. They started out on the prairie in a northeasterly direction, and, on Wednesday morn- ing, changed their course south-easterly, till they struck the Lac qui Parle road, and then made di- rectly for Fort Ridgely. On Wednesday they were joined by three Germans, who had escaped from Yellow Medicine. On Wednesday night they found themselves in the vicinity of the Upper Agency, and turned to the north again, keeping out on the prairie. On Friday they were in the neighborhood of Beaver Creek, when Dr. Wil- liamson, who, with his wife and sister, had re- mained behind, overtook them in an ox-cart, hav- ing left about twenty -four hours later. They now determined to go to Fort Ridgely. When within a few mdes of that post, just at night, they were discovered by two Indians on horseback, who rode along parallel with the train for awhile, and then turned and galloped away, and the fugitives has- tened on, momentardy expecting an attack. Near the Three-Mile creek they passed a dead body lying by the road-side. They drove on, passing the creek, and, turning to the left, passed out on to the prairie, and halted a mile and a half from the fort. It was now late at night; they had heard firing, and had seen Indians in the vicinity. They were in doubt what to do. It was at length decided that Andrew Hunter should endeavor to enter . the fort and ascertain its condition, and learn, if possible, whether they could get in. Hunter went, and, although it was well-nigh sur- rounded by savages (they had been besieging it ad the afternoon), succeeded in crawling by on his hands and knees. He was told that it would be impossible for so large a party, forty-odd, to get through the Indian lines, and that he had better return and tell them to push on toward the towns below. He left as he had entered, crawling out into the prairie, and reached his friends in safety. It seemed very hard, to be so near a place of fan cied security, and obdged to turn away from it, and, weary and hungry, press on. Perils beset their path on every hand; dangers, seen and un seen, were around them; but commending them selves to the care of Him who \"suffereth not a sparrow to fad to the ground without His notice,\" they resumed their weary march. They knew that all around them the work of death and deso lation was going on, for the midnight sky, on every side, was red with the lurid flame of burn ing habitations. They heard from out the gloom the tramp of horses' feet, hurrying past them in the darkness; but they stdl pressed on. Soon their wearied animals gave out, and again they encamped for the night. With the early dawn they were upon the move, some eight miles from the fort, in the direction of Henderson. Here, four men, the three Germans who had joined them on Wednesday, and a young man named Gilligan, left them, and went off in the direction of New Ulm. The bodies of these unfortunate men were afterward found, scarcely a mile from the place where they had left the guidance of Other Day. They traveled on in the direction of Henderson, slowly and painfully, for their teams, as well as themselves, were nearly exhausted. That day the savages were beleaguering New Ulm, and the sounds of the conflict were borne faintly to their ears upon the breeze. They had flour with them, but no means of cooking it, and were, consequently, much of the time without proper food. On the afternoon of this day they came to a deserted house, on the road from Fort Ridgley to Hender son, the house of Michael Cummings, where they found a stove, cooking utensils, and a jar of cream. Obtaining some ears of corn from the field or gar den near by, and \"confiscating\" the cream, they prepared themselves the first good meal they had had since leaving their homes so hastdy on Mon day night. After refreshing themselves and their worn ani mals at this place for some hours, their journey was again resumed. That night they slept in a forsaken house on the prairie, and, on Sabbath morning early, were again on their way. As they proceeded, they met some of the settlers returning to their deserted farms, and calling a halt at a de serted house, where they found a large company of people, they concluded to remain until Monday, and recuperate themselves and teams, as well as to observe in a proper manner the holy Sabbath. On Monday morning they separated, part going to Henderson and part to St. Peter, ad feeling that"], [222, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 208 for their saving the life of Blair, who was a white man. the All-seeing Eye that never slumbers or sleeps had watched over them, and that the loving hand of God had guided them safely through the dan gers, seen and unseen, that had beset their path. In the region of the State above the Upper Agency there were but few white inhabitants. Of ad those residing on the Chippewa river, near its mouth, we can hear of but one who escaped, and he was wounded, while his comrade, who lived with him was kided. This man joined the party of the missionaries, and got away with them. Crow told him to go away, as his young men were going to kid him; and he made his escape to Fort Ridgely, being out some five days and nights without food. Mr. Blair was in poor health. The hardships he endured were too much for his al ready shattered constitution; and although he es caped the tomahawk and scalping-knde, he was soon numbered among the victims of the massacre. J. H. Ingalls, a Scotchman, who resided in this neighborhood, and his wife, were kdled, and their four chddren were taken into captivity. Two of them, young girls, aged twelve and fourteen years, were rescued at Camp Release, and the two little boys were taken away by Little Crow. Poor little fellows! their fate is stdl shrouded in mystery. A Mr. Frace, residing near Brown's place, was also kided. His -wife and two chddren were found at Camp Release. On the Yellow Medicine, above the Agency about twelve mdes, was a settler named James W. Lindsay. He was unmarried, and another single man was \"baching it\" with him. They were both killed. Their nearest white neighbors were at the Agency, and they could not be warned of their danger, and knew nothing of it untd the savages were upon them. The town of Leavenworth was situated on the Cottonwood, in the county of Brown. Word was brought to some of the settlers in that town, on Monday afternoon, that the Indians had broken out and were kiding the inhabitants on the Min nesota. They immediately began to make prepa rations to leave. Mr. William Carrod started at once for New Ulm alone, to learn the facts of the rumored outbreak. The most of the inhabitants, alarmed by these rumors, fled that night toward New Ulm. Some of them reached that town in safety, and others were waylaid and massacred upon the road. CHAPTER XXXV.

Taking his wife, he crossed the Minnesota river, and went to the house of Major Joseph R. Brown. The family of a Mr. Blum, a worthy German citizen, were all, except a small boy, killed whde endeavoring to escape. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Philetus Jackson was killed, while on the way to town with his wife and son. Mrs. Jackson and the young man escaped. Major Brown's family consisted of his wife and nine children ; Angus Brown and wife, and Charles Blair, a son-in-law, his wife, and two children. The Major himself was away from home. Includ ing Wohler and his wife, there were then at their house, on the evening of the 18th of August, eighteen persons. We insert here the statements of two ladies, who escaped from this neighborhood, as they detad very fully the events of several days in that local ity. Mrs. Mary J. Covill, wife of George W. Covill, says: They started, early on the morning of the 19th, to make their escape, with one or two others of their neighbors, Charles Holmes, a single man, re siding on the claim above them, being of the party. They were overtaken near Beaver Creek by Indi ans, and all of the Browns, Mr. Blair and family, and Mrs. Wohler, were captured, and taken at once to Little Crow's vidage. Messrs. Wohler and Holmes escaped. Major Brown's family were of mixed Indian blood. This fact, probably, accounts \"On Monday, the 18th of August, messengers came to the house of Luthur Whiton, from both above and below, with a report of an outbreak of the Indians. My husband was at Mr. Whiton's, stacking grain. He came home about four o'clock P. M., and told me about it, and then went back to Whiton's, about half a mde away, to get a Mr. Riant, who had recently come there from the State"], [223, "STATEMENT OF MRS. COVILL. 209 of Maine, to take his team and escape. I packed a trunk with clothing, and hid it in the grass, and then went myself to Whiton's, as I was afraid to remain at home. Mr. Riant got up his team, and taking his two trunks \u2014 one of them containing over two thousand dollars in gold \u2014 took us all with him. There was a family at Mr. Whiton's from Tennessee, and a young chdd of theirs had died that day. The poor woman took her dead child in her arms, and we all started across the prairie, avoiding the road, for Mankato. We camped that night about three miles from home, on the prairie; and seeing no fires, as of burning buildings, returned to the house of our neighbor, Van Guilder, and found that the settlers had nearly all left. Mr. Van Guilder and family, Edward Allen and wife, Charles Smith and family and Mrs. Carrod, were all we knew of that re mained. trunks, made a wagon-load. The dead child, which the mother had brought back to the house with her, was left lying upon the table. It was afterward found, with its head severed from its body by the fiends. S. L. Wait and Luther Whiton, who had concealed themselves in the grass when they saw the Indians coming, joined us. Mrs. A. B. Hough and infant child were with the family of Van Guilder. These made our number up to fif teen. We traveled across the prairie all day with out seeing any Indians, and, at night, camped on the Little Cottonwood. We waded the stream, and made our camp on the opposite side, in the tall grass and reeds. We reached this spot on Tuesday night, and remained there tid Friday af ternoon, without food, save a little raw flour, which we did not dare to cook, for fear the smoke would reveal our whereabouts to the savages, when a company from New Ulm rescued us. \" We started on, thinking that we would over take the Leavenworth party, who had been gone about an hour. We had gone about two and a half miles, when we saw, ahead of us, 51 team, with two men in the wagon, who drove toward us until they got into a hollow, and then got out and went behind a knod. We drove quite near them, when Mr. Covill discovered them to be Indians. Riant turned his horses round and fled, when they jumped up out of the grass, whooped, and fired at us. They then jumped into their wagon and followed. Mr. Covill had the only gun in the party that could be used, and kept it pointed at the Indians as we retreated. They fired at us some half-dozen times, but, fortunately, without injuring any one. \" On Wednesday night, after dark, Covill and Wait started for New Ulm, to get a party to come out to our aid, saying they would be back the next day. That night, and nearly ad the next day, it rained. At about daylight the next day, when just across the Big Cottonwood, five miles from New Ulm, they heard an Indian whooping in their rear, and turned aside into some hazel-bushes, where they lay ad day. At the place where they crossed the river they found a fish-rack in the water, and in it caught a fish. Part of this they ate raw that day. It was now Thursday, and they had eaten nothing since Monday noon. They started again at dark for New Ulm. When near the graveyard, two miles from the town, an Indian, with grass tied about his head, arose from the ground and attempted to head them off. They succeeded in evading him, and got in about ten o'clock. When about entering the place, they were fired upon by the pickets, which alarmed the town, and when they got in, ad was in commo tion, to meet an expiected attack. \" We drove hastily back to the house of Van Guilder, and entered it as quickly as passible, the savages firing upon us ad the time. Mr. Van Guilder had just started away, with his family, as we came back, and returned to the house with us. A shot from the Indians broke the arm of his mo ther, an aged lady, soon after we got into the house, as she was passing a window. In our haste, we had not stopped to hitch the horses, and they soon started off, and the Indians followed. As they were going over a hill near the house, they shook a white cloth at us, and, whooping, disap peared. There were in this company \u2014 after Riant was gone, who left us, and hid in a slough\u2014 fifteen persons. We immediately started out on the prai rie again. We had now only the ox-team of Van Guilder, and the most of us were compeded to walk. His mother, some smad children, and some \" The next morning, one hundred and fifty men, under Captain Tousley, of Le Sueur, and S. A. Buell, of St. Peter, started to our rehef, reaching our place of concealment about two o'clock. They brought us food, of which our famished party eagerly partook. They were accompanied by Dr. A. W.

He visited the houses of most of his neighbors, and finding no one, started back alone. When near the house of Mr. Hid, between Leavenworth and New Ulm, on the river, he saw what he supposed were white men at the house, but when within a few rods of them, discovered they were Indians. The moment he made this discovery he turned to flee to the woods near by. They fired upon him, and gave chase, but he outran them, and reached the timber unharmed. Here he remained concealed untd late at night, when he made his way back to town, where he found his wife, who, with others of their neighbors, had fled on the first alarm, and reached the village in safety. Mrs. Laura Whiton, widow of Edjah Whiton, of Leavenworth, Brown county, makes the fodowing statement: \"At about the same time that we returned to the house of Mr. Van Guilder, on Tuesday, Charles Smith and family, Edward Aden and wife, and Mrs. Carroll had left it, and reached New Ulm without seeing Indians, about half an hour before the place was attacked. The same day, Wdliam Carroll, with a party of men, came to the house for us, found Mr. Riant, who was concealed in a slough, and started back toward New Ulm. But few of them reached the town alive.\" An account of the adventures of this company, and its fate, will be found elsewhere, in the state ment of Ralph Thomas, one of the party. \"We had resided on our claim, at Leavenworth, a little over four years. There were in our famdy, on the 18th of August, 1862, four persons \u2014 Mr. Whiton, myself, and two chddren \u2014 a son of sixteen years, and a daughter nine years of age. On Mon day evening, the 18th of August, a neighbor, Mr. Jackson, and his son, a young boy, who resided three miles from our place, came to our house in search of their horses, and told us that the Indians had murdered a family on the Minnesota river, and went away. We saw no one, and heard nothing more untd Thursday afternoon fodowing, about 4 o'clock, when about a dozen Indians were seen coming from the direction of the house of a neigh bor named Heydrick, whom they were chasing. Heydrick jumped off a bridge across a ravine, and, running down the ravine, concealed himself under a log, where he remained untd 8 o'clock, when he came out, and made his escape into New Ulm. On Monday, the 18th of August, two women, Mrs. Harrington and Mrs. Hdl, residing on the Cottonwood, below Leavenworth, heard of the out break, and prevailed upon a Mr. Henshaw, a sin gle man, living near them, to harness up his team and take them away, as their husbands were away from home. Mrs. Harrington had two children ; Mrs. Hid none. They had gone but a short dis tance when they were overtaken by Indians. Mr. Henshaw was killed, and Mrs. Harrington was badly wounded, the ball passing through her shoulder. She had just sprung to the ground with her youngest child in her arms; one of its arms was thrown over her shoulder, and the bad passed through its little hand, lacerating it dread fully. The Indians were intent upon securing the team, and the women were not followed, and es caped. Securing the horses, they drove away in an opposite direction. \"The savages had already slain all his family, consisting of his wife and two chddren. Mr. Whiton, who was at work near the door at the time, came into the house, but even then did not believe there was any thing serious, supposing Heydrick was unnecessardy frightened. But when he saw them leveling their guns at him, he came to the conclusion that we had better leave. He loaded bis double-barreled gun, and we ad started for the timber. After reaching the woods, Mr. Whiton left us to go to the house of his brother, Luther, a single man, to see what had become of him, telling us to remain where we were until he came back. We never saw him again. After he left us, not daring to remain where we were, we Mrs. Harrington soon became faint from the loss of blood; and Mrs. Hid, concealing her near a slough, took the eldest child and started for New Ulm. Before reaching that place she met John Jackson and Widiam Carrod, who resided on the Cottonwood, above them; and, telling them what had happened, they put her on one of their horses and turned back with her to the town. On the next day, Tuesday, Mr. Jackson was one of the party with Carrcll, heretofore mentioned, that went out to Leavenworth, and visited the house of Van Guilder, in search of their families. When that party turned back to New Ulm, Jack-"], [225, "STATEMENT OF MRS.

After awhile he ven tured out. Being too much exhausted to carry it, he threw away the gun, and that night ar rived at New Ulm, without again encountering Indians.\" \" While we lay concealed in the woods, we heard the Indians driving up our oxen, and yoking them up. They hitched them to our wagon, loaded it up with our trunks, bedding, etc., and drove away. we went out on the prairie, and walked all night and all next day, arriving at New Ulm at about dark on Friday, the 22d. About midnight, on Thursday night, as we were fleeing along the road, we passed the bodies of the family of our neigh bor, Blum, lying dead by the road-side. They had started to make their escape to town, but were overtaken by the savages upon the road, and ad but a little boy most brutally murdered. We now return to Mrs. Harrington, whom, the reader will remember, we left badly wounded, con cealed near a slough. We regret our inability to obtain a full narrative of her wanderings during the eight succeeding days and nights she spent alone upon the prairie, carrying her wounded child. We can only state in general terms, that after wandering for eight weary days and nights, without food or shelter, unknowing whither, earlv on the morning of Tuesday, the 26th, before day light, she found herself at Crisp's fann, midway between New Ulm and Mankato. As she ap proached the pickets she mistook them for In dians, and, when hailed by them, was so fright ened as not to recognize the English language, and intent only on saving her hfe, told them she was a Sioux. Two guns were instantly leveled at her, but, providentially, both missed fire, when an exclamation from her led them to think she was white, and a woman, and they went out to her. She was taken into camp and ad done for her by Jutlge Flandrau and his men that could be done. They took her to Mankato, and soon after she was joined by her husband, who was below at the time of the outbreak, and also found the chdd which Mrs. Hill took with her to New Ulm. \" Mr. Whiton returned home, from his visit to the house of his brother, which he found deserted, aud found that our house had already been plun dered. He then went to the woods to search for us. He remained in the timber, prosecuting his search, until Saturday, without food; and, failing to find us, he came to the conclusion that we were either dead or in captivity, and then himself start ed for New Ulm. On Saturday night, when trav eling across the prairie, he came suddenly upon a camp of Indians, but they did not see him, and he beat as hasty a retreat as possible from their vi cinity. \"When near the Lone Cottonwood Tree, on Sunday morning, he fell in with Wdliam J. Duly, who had made his escape from Lake Shetek. They traveled along together tid they came to the house of Mr. Henry Thomas, six miles from our farm, in the town of Mdford. This house had evi dently been deserted by the famdy in great haste, for the table was spread for a meal, and the food remained untouched upon it. Here they sat down to eat, neither of them having had any food for a long time. Whde seated at the table, two Indians came to the house; and, as Mr. Whiton arose and stepped to the stove for some water, they came into the door, one of them saying, 'Da mea tepee.' [This is my house.] There was no way of escape, and Mr. Whiton, thinking to propitiate him, said 'Come in-' Mr. Duly was sitting partly behind the door, and was, probably, unobserved. The savage made no answer, but instantly raised his gun, and shot him through the heart, they then both went into the corn. Duly was unarmed; and, when Mr. Whiton was killed, took his gun and ran out of the house, and concealed himself in the bushes near by. Six miles from New Ulm there lived, on the Cottonwood, in th9 county of Brown, a German family of the name of Heyers, consisting of the father, mother and two sons, both young men. A burial party that went out from New Ulm on Friday, the 22d, found them all murdered, and buried them near where they were killed. The town of Mdford, Brown county, adjoining New Ulm on the west and contiguous to the res ervation, was a farming community, composed en tirely of Germans. A quiet, sober, industrious, and enterprising class of emigrants had here made their homes, and the prairie wdilemess around them began to \"bud and blossom like the rose.\" Industry and thrift had brought their sure reward, and peace, contentment and happiness filleel the hearts of this simple-hearted people.

When the sun arose on the morning of the 18th of August, 1862, it looked down upon this scene in'all its glowing beauty; but its declining rays fed upon a field of carnage and horror too fearful to describe. The council at Rice Creek, on Sun day night, had decided upon the detads of the work of death, and the warriors of the lower bands were early on the trail, thirsting for blood. Early in the forenoon of Monday they appeared in large numbers in this neighborhood, and the work of slaughter began. The first house visited was that of Wilson Massipost, a prominent and influential citizen, a widower. Mr. Massipost had two daughters, intelligent and accomplished. These the savages murdered most brutally. The head of one of them was afterward found, severed from the body, attached to a fish-hook, and hung upon a nad. His son, a young man of twenty four years, was also kided. Mr. Massipost and a son of eight years escaped to New Ulm. The house of Anton Hanley was likewise visited. Mr. Hanley was absent. The chddren, four in num ber, were beaten with tomahawks on the head and person, inflicting fearful wounds. Two of them were kided outright, and one, an infant, recovered; the other, a young boy, was taken by the parents, at night, to New Ulm, thence to St. Paul, where he died of his wounds. After killing these child ren, they proceeded to the field near by, where Mrs. Hanley, her father, Anton Mesmer, his wife, son Joseph, and daughter, were at work harvesting wheat. All these they instantly shot, except Mrs. Hanley, who escaped to the woods and secreted herself tfll night, when, her husband coming home, they took their two wounded children and made their escape. At the house of Agrenatz Hanley ad the children were kdled. The parents escaped. There resided, on the Big Cottonwood, between New Ulm and Lake Shetek, a German, named Charles Zierke, familiarly known throughout ad that region as \"Dutch Charley.\" On the same road resided an old gentleman, and his son and daughter, named Brown. These adventurous pio neers lived many miles from any other human habitation, and kept houses of entertainment on that lonely road. This last-named house was known as \"Brown's place.\" It is not known to us when the savages came to those isolated dwell ings. We only know that the mutilated bodies of all three of the Brown famdy were found, and buried, some miles from their house. Zierke and his family made their escape toward New Ulm, and, when near the town, were pursued and over taken by the Indians on the prairie. By sharp running, Zierke escaped to the town, but his wife and children, together with his team, were taken by them. Returning afterward with a party of men, the savages abandoned the captured team, woman, and children, and they were recovered and ad taken into New Ulm in safety. The frontier of Nicollet county contiguous to the reservation was not generally visited by the savages until Tuesday, the 19th, and the succeed ing days of that week. The people had, generally in the meantime, sought safety in flight, and were principally in the town of St. Peter. A few, how ever, remained at their homes, in isolated locali ties, where the news of the awful scenes enacting around them did not reach them; or, who having removed their families to places of safety, returned to look after their property. These generady fed victims to the rifle and tomahawk of the savages. The destruction of life in this county, was, how ever, trifling, compared with her sister counties of Brown and Renville; but the loss of property was immense. The entire west half of the county was, of necessity, abandoned and completely desolated. The ripened grain crop was much of it uncut, and wasted in the field, while horses and cattle and sheep and hogs roamed unrestrained at wid over the unharvested fields. And, to render the ruin complete the savage hordes swept over this por tion of the county, gathering up horses and cattle shooting swine and sheep, and all other stock that Bastian Mey, wife, and two children were mas sacred in their house, and three chddren were ter ribly mutilated, who afterward recovered. Adolph Shilling and his daughter were killed; his son badly wounded, escaped with his mother. Two families, those of a Mr. Zeller and a Mr. Zet tle, were completely annihilated; not a soul was left to tell the tale of their sudden destruction. Jacob Keck, Max Fink, and a Mr. Belzer were also victims of savage barbarity at this place. Af ter killing the inhabitants, they plundered and"], [227, "DEVASTATION IN NICOLLET COUNTY. 213 they could not catch; finishing the work of ruin by applying the torch to the stacks of hay and grain, and in some instances to the dwellings of the settlers. bers as it moved across the prairie, rolled an overwhelming flood into the towns along the river. The entire county of Nicodet, outside of St. Peter, was depopulated, and their crops and herds left by the inhabitants to destruction. William Mills kept a public house in the town of West Newton, four miles from Fort Ridgely, on the St. Peter road. Mr. Mills heard of the out break of the Sioux on Monday, and at once took the necessary steps to secure the safety of his fam ily, by sending them across the prairie to a se cluded spot, at a slough some three miles from the house. Leaving a span of horses and a wagon with them, he instructed them, if it should seem necessary to their safety, to drive as rapidly as possible to Henderson. He then went to Fort Ridgely to possess himsed, if possible, of the exact state of affairs. At night he visited his house, to obtain some articles of clothing for his family, and carried them out to their place of concealment, and went again to the fort, where he remained until Tuesday morning, when he started out to his fam ily, thinking he would send them to Henderson, and return and assist in the defense of that post. Soon after leaving the fort he met Lieutenant T. J. Sheehan and his company, on their way back to that post. Sheehan roughly demanded of him where he was going. He replied he was going to send his family to a place of safety, and return. The lieutenant, with an oath, wrested from him his gun, the only weapon of defense he had, thus leav ing him defenseless. Left thus unarmed and powerless, he took his family and hastened to Hen derson, arriving there that day in safety. On the arrival of a force of mounted men, under Captains Anson Northrup, of Minneapolis, and R. H. Chittenden, of the First Wisconsin Cavalry, at Henderson, on the way to Fort Ridgely, they met Charles Nelson, and, on consultation, decided to go to St. Peter, where they were to report to Colonel Sibley, by way of Norwegian Grove. Securing the services of Nelson, John Fadden, and one or two others, familiar to the country, they set out for the Grove. Captain Chittenden, in a letter to the \"New Haven Palladium,\" written soon after, says: \" The prairie was magnificent, but quite desert ed. Sometimes a dog stared at us as we passed; but even the brutes seemed conscious of a terrible calamity. At 2 o'clock we reached the Grove, which surrounded a lake. The farms were in a fine state of cultivation; and, strange to say, although the houses were in ruins, the grain stacks were un touched. Reapers stood in the field as the men had left them. Cows wandered over the prairies in search of their masters. Nelson led the way to the spot where he had been overtaken in attempt ing to escape with his wife and chddren. We found his wagon; the ground was strewn with ar ticles of apparel, his wife's bonnet, boxes, yarn, in fact everything they had hastdy gathered up. But the wife and boys were gone. Her he had seen them murder, but the chddren had run into the corn-field. He had also secreted a woman and child under a hay -stack. We went and turned it over; they were gone. I then so arranged the troops that, by marching abreast, we made a thorough search of the corn-field. No clue to his boys could be found. Passing the stdl burning embers of his neighbor's dwellings, we came to Nelson's own, the only one stid standing. * * * The heart-broken man closed the gate, and turned away without a tear; then simply asked Sergeant Thompson when he thought it would be safe to return. I must confess that, accustomed as I am to scenes of horror, the tears would come.\" A few Indians were seen in the neighborhood of West Newton on Monday afternoon on horseback, but at a distance on the prairie. The most of the inhabitants fled to the fort on that day: a few re mained at their homes and some fled to St. Peter and Henderson. The town of Lafayette was, in like manner, deserted on Monday and Monday night, the inhabitants chiefly making for St. Peter. Courtland township, lying near New Ulm, caught the contagion, and her people too fled \u2014 the women and children going to St. Peter, while many of her brave sons rushed to the defense of New Ulm, and in that terrible siege bore a conspicuous and hon orable part.

On the 21st of August, four of these men at work cutting hay, unsuspicious of danger, were suddenly attacked and ad murdered, except Anton Manderfield; while one half-breed, at the store, Baptiste Gubeau, was taken prisoner, and was informed that he would be kided that night. But Gubeau succeeded in escaping from their grasp, and making his way to the lake. His escape was a wonderful feat, bound as he was, as to his hands, pursued by yeding demons determ ined on his death. But, ahead of ad his pursuers, he reached the lake, and dashing into the reeds on the margin, was hid from the sight of his disappointed pursuers. Wading noiselessly into the water, untd his head alone was above the water, he remained perfectly stdl for some time. The water soon loosened the rawhide on his wrists, so that they were easily removed. The Indians sought for him in vain ; and as the shades of night gathered around him, he came out of his hiding place, crossed the foot of the lake and struck out for the Upper Mississippi. He finally reached St. Cloud. Here he was mistaken for an Indian spy, and threatened with death, but was finally saved by the interposi tion of a gentleman who knew him. Jacob Mauerle had taken his family down to St. Peter, and returned on Friday to his house, in West Newton. He had tied some clothing in a bundle, and started for the fort, when he was shot and scalped, some eighty rods from the house. The two Applebaum's were evidently fleeing to St. Peter, when overtaken by the Indians and kided. Felix Smith had escaped to Fort Ridgely, and on Wednesday forenoon went out to his house, some three miles away. The Indians attacked the fort that afternoon, and he was kided in endeavor ing to get back into that post. Small parties of Indians scoured the country be tween Fort Ridgely, St. Peter, and Henderson, during the first week of the massacre, driving away cattle and burning buildings, within twelve miles of the first-named place. The Swan Lake House was laid in ashes. A scouting party of six savages was seen by General M. B. Stone, upon the bluff, in sight of the town of St. Peter, on Friday, the 22d day of August, the very day they were making their most furious and determined assault upon Fort Ridgely. The other employes at the lake were ad killed except Manderfield, who secreted himself whde his comrades were being murdered. Manderfield, in his escape, when near Lac qui Parle, was met by Joseph Laframboise, who had gone thither to ob tain his sister Julia, then a captive there. Man derfield received from Laframboise proper direc tions, and finady reached Fort Ridgely in safety. This scouting party had, doubtless, been de tached from the main force besieging that post, and sent forward, under the delusion that the fort must fall into their hands, to reconnoiter, and re port to Little Crow the condition of the place, and the abilitv of the people to defend themselves. But they failed to take Fort Ridgely, and, on the 22d, their scouts saw a large body of troops, under Colonel Sibley, enter St. Peter. Lake Shetek. \u2014 This beautiful lake of quiet water, some six miles long and two broad, is situ ated about seventy miles west of New Ulm, in the county of Murray. Here a httle community of some fifty persons were residing far out on our frontier, the nearest settlement being the Big Cot tonwood. The families and persons located here were: John Eastlick and wife, Charles Hatch, Phineas B. Ilurd and wife, John Wright, Wm. J. Duly and wife, H. W. Smith, Aaron Myers, Mr. Everett and wife, Thomas Ireland and wife, Koch and wife ; these with their several famdies, and six single men, Wm. James, Edgar Bently, John Voight, E. G. Cook, and John F. and Daniel Burns, the latter residing alone on a claim at Wal nut Grove, some distance from the lake, consti tuted the entire population of Lake Shetek settle ment, in Murray county.

At Big Stone Lake, in what is now Big Stone county, were four trading houses, Wm. H. Forbes, Daily, Pratt & Co., and Nathan Myrick.

Mr. Hurd himself had left home for the Missouri river on the 2d day of June previous. Ten of these In dians entered the house, talked and smoked their pipes while Mrs. Hurd was getting breakfast. Mr. Voight, the work-hand, whde waiting for break fast, took up the babe, as it awoke and cried, and walked with it out in the yard in front of the door. No sooner had he left the house than an Indian took his gun and deliberately shot him dead near the door. Mrs. Hurd was amazed at the infernal deed, as these Indians had always been kindly treated, and often fed at her table. She ran to the fallen man to raise him up and look after the At Lake Shetek, the settlers were soon all gath- ered at the house of John Wright, prepared for defense. They were, however, induced by the ap- parently friendly persuasion of the Indians to abandon the house, and move towards the slough for better safety. The Indians commenced firing upon the retreating party. The whites returned the fire as they ran. Mrs. Eastlick was wounded in the heel, Mr. Duly's oldest son and daughter were shot through the shoulder, and Mrs. Ireland's youngest child was shot through the leg, while running to the slough. Mr. Hatch, Mr. Everett, Mr. Eastlick, Mrs. Eastlick, Mrs. Everett, and sev- eral chddren were shot. The Indians now told the women to come out of the slough, and they would not kill them or the chddren, if they would come out. They went out lo them with the chddren, when they shot Mrs. Everett, Mrs. Smith, and Mrs. Ireland dead, and killed some of the children. Mrs. Eastlick was shot and left on the field, sup- posed to be dead, but she finally escaped, and two of her chddren, Merton and Johnny. Her inter- esting narrative wdl be found in the large work, from which this abridgment is made up. Mrs. Julia A. Wright, and Mrs. Duly, and the two chd- dren of Mrs. Wright, and two of the children of Mrs. Duly were taken captive. Some of these were taken by the fodowers of Little Crow to the Missouri river, and were subsequently ransomed at Fort Pierre, by Major Galpin. Ad the men ex- cept Mr. Eastlick, being only wounded, escaped to the settlements. The brothers Burns remained on their claim, and were not molested. One sneaking Indian coining near them paid the for feit with his life. safety of her child. To her utter horror, one of the miscreants intercepted her, telling her to leave at once and go to the settlements across the prairie. She was refused the privdege of dressing her naked chddren, and was compelled to turn away from her ruined home, to commence her wandering over an almost trackless waste, without food, and almost without raiment, for either hersed or httle ones. These Indians proceeded from the house of Mr. Hurd to that of Mr. Andrew Koch, whom they shot, and plundered the house of its contents. Mrs. Koch was compelled to get up the oxen and hitch them to the wagon, and drive them, at the direction of her captors, into the Indian country. In this way she traveled ten days. She was the captive of White Lodge, an old and ugly chief of one of the upper bands. As the course was tow- ards the Missouri river, Mrs. Koch refused to go farther in that direction. The old chief threatened to shoot her if she did not drive on. Making a virtue of necessity she reluctantly obeyed. Soon after she was required to carry the vagabond's gun. Watching her opportunity she destroyed the explosive quality of the cap, and dampened the powder in the tube, leaving the gun to appear- ance ad right. Soon afterward she again refused to go any farther in that direction. Again the old scoundrel threatened her with death. She in- stantly bared her bosom and dared him to fire. He aimed his gun at her breast and essayed to fire, but the gun refused to take part in the work of death. The superstitious savage, supposing she bore a charmed life, lowered his gun, and asked which way she wishsd to go. She pointed toward the settlements. In this direction the teams were turned. They reached the neighbor- Spieit Lake. \u2014 On or about the 25th day of August, 1862, the \"Annuity Sioux Indians\" made their appearance at Spirit Lake, the scene of the terrible Inkpaduta massacre of 1857.

S. R. Riggs; but it is scarcely satisfactory to the general reader that the Christian Indians were entirely in nocent of ad blame in the great massacre of 1862. Dakota Territory. \u2014 Portions of Dakota Ter ritory were visited by the Sioux in 1862. At Sioux Falls City the fodowing murders were com mitted by the Sioux Indians on the 25th of Au gust: Mr. Joseph B. and Mr. M. Amidon, father and son, were found dead in a corn-field, near which they had been making hay. The son was shot with both balls and arrows, the father with bads only. Their bodies lay some ten rods apart. On the morning of the 26th, about fifteen Indians, supposed to be Sioux, attacked the camp of sol diers at that place. They were fodowed, but eluded the vigilant pursuit of our soldiers and es caped. The families, some ten in number, were removed to Yankton, the capital, sixty-five miles distant. This removal took place before the mur ders at Lake Shetek were known at Sioux Falls City. The mail carrier who carried the news from New Ulm had not yet arrived at Sioux Falls, on his return trip. He had, on his outward trip, found Mrs. Eastlick on the prairie, near Shetek, and carried her to the house of Mr. Brown, on the Cottonwood. CHAPTER XXXVII. Occurrences previous to the attack on the TOWN OF NEW ULM THE ATTACK BY INDIANS \u2014 \u25a0 JUDGE FLANDRAU ARRIVES WITH REINFORCEMENTS - \u2014 EVACUATION OF NEW ULM. On the 18th of August, the day of the outbreak, a volunteer recruiting party for the Union army went out from New Ulm. Some eight miles west of that place several dead bodies were found on the road. The party turned back toward the town, and, to the surprise of all, were fired upon by In dians in ambush, killing several of their party. Another party leaving New Ulm for the Lower Agency, when seven miles above the town some fifty Indians near the road fired upon them, killing three of these men. This party returned to town. One of these parties had seen, near the Cotton wood, Indians kdl a man on a stack of grain, and some others in the field. The people of the sur rounding country fled for their hves into the town, leaving, some of them, portions of their families killed at their homes or on the way to some place of safety. In one week after the murders at the Fads, one half of the inhabitants of the Missouri slope had fled to Sioux City, Iowa, six miles below the mouth of the Big Sioux. The Murder of Amos Huggins. \u2014 Amos Hug gins (in the language of Rev. S. R. Riggs, in his late work, 1880, entitled \"Mary and I,\") \"was the eldest child of Alexander G. Huggins, who had accompanied Dr. Williamson to the Sioux coun try in 1835. Amos was born in Ohio, and was at this time (1862) over thirty years old. He was married, and two chddren blessed their home, which for some time before the outbreak had been at Lac qui Parle, near where the town of that name now stands. It was then an Indian vdlage and planting place, the principal man being Wa kanmane \u2014 Spirit Walker, or Walking Spirit. If the people of the village had been at home Mr. Huggins and his family, which included Miss Julia Laframboise, who was also a teacher in the employ of the Government, would have been safe. But in the absence of Spirit Walker's people three Indian men came \u2014 two of them from the Lower Sioux Agency \u2014 and killed Mr. Huggins, and took from the house such things as they wanted.\" pp. 169-170. During the 18th and 19th of August the In dians overran the country, burning buildings and driving off the stock from the farms. The people had no arms fit for use, and were perfectly panic-stricken and helpless. But the news of the outbreak had reached St. Peter, and at about one o'clock of August 19th, T. B. Thompson, James Hughes, Charles Wetherell, Samuel Coffin, Merrick Dickinson, H. Cay wood, A. M. Bean, James Parker, Andrew Friend, Henry and Frederick Otto, C. A. Stein, E. G. Covey, Frank Kennedy, Thomas and Griffin Williams, and the Hon. Henry A. Swift, afterwards made Governor of Minnesota, by opera tion of the organic law, and Wdliam G. Hayden, organized themselves into a company, by the elec tion of A. M. Bean; Captain, and Samuel Coffin, Lieutenant, and took up position at New Ulm, in the defense of that beleaguered place. They at once advanced upon the Indians, who were posted behind This apology for the conduct of Christian In-"], [231, "BATTLE OF NEW ULM. 217 the houses in the outer portions of the place. By this opportune arrival the savage foe were held in check. These were soon joined by another arrival from St. Peter: L. M. Bordman, J. B. Trogdon, J. K. Moore, Horace Austin (since Governor), P. M. Bean, James Homer, Jacob and Phdip Stetzer, William Wilkinson, Lewis Patch, S. A. Buell, and Henry Snyder, ad mounted, as well as a few from the surrounding country. coming from the direction of the Lower Agency. The movement is thus described by Judge Flan drau : \"Their advance upon the sloping prairie in the bright sunlight was a very fine spectacle, and to such inexperienced soldiers as we all were, intense ly exciting. When within about one mile of us the mass began to expand lite a fan, and increas ing in the velocity of its approach, continued this movement untd within about double rifle-shot, when it covered our entire front.

I had stationed myself at a point in the rear where communication could be had with me easily, and awaited the first discharge with great anxiety, as it seemed to me that to yield was certain destruction, as the enemies would rush into the town and drive ad before them. The yed unsettled the men a little, and just before the rifles began to crack they fell back along the whole line, and committed the error of passing the outer houses without taking possession of them, a mis take which the Indians immediately took advan tage of by themselves occupying them in squads of two, three and up to ten. They poured into us a sharp and rapid fire as we fed back, and opened from the houses in every direction. Sev eral of us rode up to the hill, endeavoring to rally the men, and with good effect, as they gave three cheers and sallied out of the various houses they had retreated to, and checked the advance effect ually. The firing from both sides then became general, sharp and rapid, and it got to be a regu lar Indian skirmish, in which every man did his own work after his own fashion. The Indians had now got into the rear of our men, and nearly on all sides of them, and the fire of the enemy was becoming very galling, as they had possession of a large number of buildings.\" On the same evening Hon. Charles E. Flandrau, at the head of about one hundred and twenty-five men, volunteers from St. Peter and vicinity, en tered the town; and reinforcements continued to arrive from Mankato, Le Sueur, and other points, until Thursday, the 21st, when about three hun dred and twenty-five armed men were in New Ulm, under the command of Judge Flandrau. Cap tain Bierbauer, at the head of one hundred men, from Mankato, arrived and participated in the de fense of the place. Some rude barricades around a few of the houses in the center of the vidage, fitted up by means of wagons, boxes and waste lumber, par tially protected the volunteer soldiery operating now under a chosen leader. On Saturday, the 22d, the commandant sent across the river seventy-five of his men to dislodge some Indians intent on burning buildings and grain and hay stacks. First Lieutenant Wdliam Huey, of Traverse des Sioux, commanded this force. This officer, on reaching the opposite shore, discovered a large body of Indians in ad vance of him; and in attempting to return was completely intercepted by large bodies of Indians on each side of the river. There was but one way of escape, and that was to retreat to the company of E. St. Julien Cox, known to be approaching from the direction of St. Peter. This force, thus cut off, returned with the command of Captain E. St. Julien Cox; and with this increased force of one hundred and seventy-five, Captain Cox soon after entered the town to the redes of both citizens and soldiers. Fight at the Wind-Mill. \u2014 Rev. B. G. Coffin, of Mankato, George B. Stewart, of Le Sueur, and J. B. Trogdon, of Nicollet, and thirteen others, fought their way to the wind-mill. This they held during the battle, their unerring shots tefl ing fearfudy upon the savages, and finally forcing them to retire. At night these brave men set fire to the budding, and then retreated within the bar ricades, in the vicinity of the Dakota House. During the firing from this mid a most determined and obstinate fight was kept up from the brick post-office, where Governor Swift was stationed, which told most fatally upon the foe, and from The Indians at the siege of New Ulm, at the time of the principal attack before the arrival of Captain Cox, were estimated at about five hundred,"], [232, "218 HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. this point many an Indian fell before the deadly aim of the true men stationed there. But strange battle field. The Indians deserted it on Sunday, and on Monday the successful de fenders also retire from a place they dare not at tempt to hold! The town was evacuated. All the women and children, and wounded men, making one hundred and fifty-three wagon loads, while a considerable number composed the com pany on foot. All these moved with the command of Judge Flandrau towards Mankato. Captain William B. Dodd. \u2014 When the attack was made upon the place the Indians had suc ceeded in reaching the Lower Town. The wind was favoring them, as the smoke of burning build ings was carried into the main portion of the town, behind which they were advancing. \"Captain William B. Dodd, of St. Peter, seeing the move ment from that quarter, supposed the expected re inforcements were in from that direction. He made at once a superhuman effort, almost, to en courage the coming troops to force the Indian line and gain admittance into the town. He had gone about seventy-five yards outside the lines, when the Indians from buildings on either side of the street poured a full volley into the horse and rider. The Captain received three bads near his heart, wheeled his horse, and riding within twenty five yards of our lines fell from his horse, and was assisted to walk into a house, where in a few mo ments he died, 'the noblest Roman of them all.' He dictated a short message to his wife, and re marked that he had discharged his duty and was ready to die. No man fought more courageously, or died more nobly. Let his virtues be forever re membered. He was a hero of the truest type!\" \u2014 St. Peter Statesman. The loss to our forces in this engagement was ten killed, and about fifty wounded. The loss of the enemy is unknown, but must have been heavy, as ten of their dead were found on the field of battle, which they had been unable to remove. We might fill volumes with incidents, and mi raculous escapes from death, but our limits abso lutely forbid their introduction in this abridge ment. The reader must consult the larger work for these details. The escape of Governor Swift, Flandrau and Bird, and J. B. Trogdon and D. G. Shellack and others from perilous positions, are among the many exciting incidents of the siege of New Ulm. Omitting the story of John W. Young, of won derful interest, we refer briefly to the weightier matters of this sad chapter, and conclude the same by the relation of one short chapter. THE EXPEDITION TO LEAVENWORTH. During the siege of New Ulm, two expeditions were sent out from that place toward the settle ments on the Big Cottonwood, and although not really forming a part of the operations of a de fensive character at that place, are yet so connect ed with them that we give them here. At the stage of the battle in which Captain Dodd was killed, several others also were either killed or wounded. Captain Saunders, a Baptist minister of Le Sueur, was wounded, with many others. Howell Houghton, an old settler, was killed. The contest was continued until dark, when the enemy began to carry off their dead and wounded. In the morning of the next day (Sun day) a feeble firing was kept up for several hours by the sullen and retiring foe. The battle of New Ulm had been fought, and the whites were masters of the field; but at what a fearful price! The dead and dying and wounded filled the buildings left standing, and this beautiful and enterprising German town, which on Monday morning con tained over two hundred buildings, had been laid in ashes, only some twenty-five houses remaining to mark the spot where New Ulm once stood. On Thursday morning, the 21st of August, a party went out on the road to Leavenworth for the purpose of burying the dead, aiding the wounded and bringing them in, should they find any, and to act as a scouting party. They went out some eight miles, found and buried several bodies, and returned to New Ulm, at night, without seeing any Indians. On Friday, the 22d, another party of one hun dred and forty men, under command of Captain George M. Tousley, started for the purpose of res cuing a party of eleven persons, women and child ren, who, a refugee informed the commandant, were hiding in a ravine out toward Leavenworth. Accompanying this party were Drs. A. W. Daniels, of St. Peter, and Ayer, of Le Sueur. On Sunday afternoon, Captain Cox's command, one hundred and fifty volunteers from Nicollet, Sibley and Le Sueur, armed with Austrian rifles, shot-guns and hunting rifles arrived. The Indians retreated, and returned no more to make battle with the forces at New Ulm. On the way out, the cannonading at Fort Ridgely was distinctly heard by them, and then"], [233, "STATEMENT OF RALPH THOMAS. 219 Dr. Daniels, who had resided among the Sioux several years as a physician to the lower bands, prairie southward. We stopped at my place and fed our horses. Whde the horses were eating, I called for three or four men to go with me to the nearest houses, to see what had become of the peo ple. We went first to the house of Mr. Mey, where we found him and his family lying around the house, to ad appearance dead. We also found here Joseph Emery and a Mr. Heuyer, also appa rently dead. We had been here some five minutes viewing the scene, when one of the chddren, a girl of seven years, rose up from the ground and com menced crying piteously. I took her in my arms, and told the other men to examine the other bodies and see if there were not more of them alive. They found two others, a twin boy and girl about two years old; all the rest were dead. had, for the first time, some conception of the ex tent and magnitude of the outbreak. As the main object of the expedition had alrea dy been accomplished \u2014 i. e., the rescue of the wo men and children \u2014 Dr. Daniels urged a return to New Ulm. The question was submitted to the company, and they decided to go on, and proceed ed to within four miles of Leavenworth, the de sign being to go to that place, remain there ad night, bury the dead next day, and return. It was now nearly night; the cannonading at the fort could stdl be heard; Indian spies were, undoubtedly, watching them; only about one hundred armed men were left in the town, and from his intimate knowledge of the Indian char acter, Dr. Daniels was convinced that the safety of their force, as well as New Ulm itself, required their immediate return. \" We next proceeded to the house of Mr. George Raeser, and found the bodies of himself and wife lying near the house by a stack of grain. We went into the house and found their child, eighteen months old, alive, trying to get water out of the pail. We then went back to my place, and sent John Thomas and Mr. Parker with an ox-team to New Ulm with these children. Mr. Mey's three children were wounded with blows of a tomahawk on the head; the other child was uninjured. We then went on toward Leavenworth, seeing neither Indians nor whites, until we arrived at the house of Mr. Seaman, near which we found an old gen- tleman named Riant concealed in a slough among the tall grass. He stated to us that a party of whites with him had been chased and fired upon by a party of Indians. It consisted of himself, Luther Whiton, George W. Covill and wife, Mrs. Covid's son, Mrs. Hough and chdd, Mr. Van Guil- der and wife and two children, and Mr. Van Guil- der's mother. Ad these Mr. Riant said had scat- tered over the prairie. We remained about two hours, hunting for the party, and not finding them, turned back toward New Uhn, taking Mr. Riant with us. We proceeded down opposite my place, where we separated, eleven going down on one side of the Big Cottonwood, to Mr. Tuttle's place, and seven of us proceeded down on the other, or north side of the stream. The design was to meet again at Mr. Tuttle's house, and all go back to New Ulm together; but when we ar- rived at Tuttle's, they had gone on to town with- out waiting for us, and we followed. When near Mr. Hibbard's place we met Mr. Jakes going west. He said that he had been within a mde of New Ulm, and saw the other men of our party. He A halt was called, and this view of the case was presented to the men by Drs. Daniels, Ayer, and Mayo. A vote was again taken, and it was deci ded to return. The return march commenced at about sundown, and at one o'clock a. m. they re entered the vidage. Ralph Thomas, who resided on the Big Cotton wood, in the county of Brown, had gone with many of his neighbors, on Monday, the 18th of August, into New Ulm for safety, while William Carroll and some others residing further up the river, in Leavenworth, had gone to the same place to ascertain whether the rumors they had heard of an uprising among the Sioux were true. Mr. Thomas makes the following statement of the do ings of this little party, and its subsequent fate: \" There were eight of us on horseback, and the balance of the party were in three wagons. We had gone about a mile when we met a German going into New Ulm, who said he saw Indians at my place skinning a heifer, and that they drove him off, chasing him with spears. He had come from near Leavenworth. We kept on to my place, near which we met John Thomas and Almon Par- ker, who had remained the night before in a grove of timber, one and a half miles from my place. About eight o'clock the evening before, they had seen a party of ten or twelve Indians, mounted on ponies, coming toward them, who chased them into the grove, the savages passing on to the right, leaving them alone. They stated to us that they had seen Indians that morning traveling over the"], [234, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 220 the redes of the place in about had an hour after I got in, and the Indians soon after retired.\" further informed us that he saw grain-stacks and sheds on fire at that distance from the place. \" When we came to the burning stacks we halted to look for Indians. Our comrades were half an hour ahead of us. When they got in sight of the town, one of them, Mr. Hinton, rode up on an ele vation, where he could overlook the place, and saw Indians, and the town on fire in several places. He went back and told them that the Indians had at tacked the town, and that he did not consider it safe for them to try to get in, and proposed cross ing the Cottonwood, and going toward the Man kato road, and entering town on that side. His proposition was opposed by several of the party, who thought him frightened at the sight of half a dozen Indians. They asked him how many he had seen. He said some forty. They came up and looked, but could see but three or four Indians. Mr. Carrod told them they had better go on, and, if opposed, cut their way through. He told Hin ton to lead, and they would fodow. They passed down the hill, and met with no opposition until they came to a slough, half a mile from the town. Here two Indians, standing on a large stone by the side of the road, leveled their double-barreled guns at Mr. Hinton. He drew his revolver, placed it between his horse's ears, and made for them. The balance of the company followed. The Indi ans retired to cover without firing a shot, and the company kept on untd they had crossed the slough, when the savages, who were lying in ambush, arose from the grass, and firing upon them, kided five of their number, viz. : William Carroll, Almond Looniis, Mr. Lamb, Mr. Riant, and a Norwegian, and chased the balance into the town. CHAPTER XXXVIII. BATTLE AT LOWER AGENCY FERRY SIEGE OF FORT RIDGELY BATTLE OF WEDNESDAY JACK FRAZER BATTLE OF FRIDAY REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE. On Monday morning, the 18th of August, 1862, at about 9 o'clock, a messenger arrived at Fort Ridgely, from the Lower Sioux Agency, bringing the startling news that the Indians were massacre ing the whites at that place. Captain John S. Marsh, of Company B, Fifth Regiment Minnesota Volunteer Infantry, then in command, immediately dispatched messengers after Lieutenant Sheehan, of Company C, of the same regiment, who had left that post on the morning before, with a detach ment of his company, for Fort Ripley, on the Upper Mississipi, and Major T. J. Galbraith, Sioux Agent, who had also left the fort at the same time with fifty men, afterwards known as the Ren vide Rangers, for Fort Snelling, urging them to return to Fort Ridgely with all possible dispatch, as there were then in the fort only Company B, numbering about seventy-five or eighty men. The gallant captain then took a detachment of forty six men, and accompanied by Interpreter Quinn, immediately started for the scene of blood, distant twelve miles. They made a very rapid march. When within about four miles of the ferry, op posite the Agency, they met the ferryman, Mr. Martelle, who informed Captain Marsh that the In dians were in considerable force, and were mur dering ad the people, and advised him to return. He replied that he was there to protect and defend the frontier, and he should do so if it was in his power, and gave the order \"Forward!\" Between this point and the river they passed nine dead bodies on or near the road. Arriving near the ferry the company was halted, and Corporal Ezekiel Rose was sent forward to examine the ferry, and see if all was right. The captain and inter preter were mounted on mules, the men were on foot, and formed in two ranks in the road, near the ferry-house, a few rods from the banks of the river. The corporal had taken a pail with him to the river, and returned, reporting the ferry all right, bringing with him water for the exhausted and thirsty men.. \"We came on about half an hour afterward, and passing down the hill, crossed the same slough, and unconscious of danger, approached the fatal spot, when about one hundred and fifty savages sprang up out of the grass and fired upon us, kdling five horses and six men. My own horse was shot through the body, close to my leg, killing him instantly. My feet were out of the stirrups in a moment, and I sprang to the ground, striking on my hands and feet. I dropped my gun, jump ed up, and ran. An Indian, close behind, dis charged the contents of both barrels of a shot-gun at me. The charge tore up the ground at my feet, throwing dirt all around me as I ran. I made my way into town on foot as fast as I could go. No other of our party escaped; ad the rest were kided. Reinforcements from St. Peter came to"], [235, "CAPTAIN MARSH KILLED. 221 In the meantime an Indian had made his ap pearance on the opposite bank, and calling to Quinn, urged them to come across, telling him all was right on that side. The suspicions of the cap tain were at once aroused, and he ordered the men to remain in their places, and not to move on to the boat until he could ascertain whether the In dians were in ambush in the ravines on the oppo site shore. The men were in the act of drinking, when the savage on the opposite side, seeing they were not going to cross at once, fired his gun, as a signal, when instantly there arose out of the grass and brush, all around them, some four or five hun dred warriors, who poured a terrific volley upon the devoted band. The aged interpreter fell from his mule, pierced by over twenty balls. The cap tain's mule fell dead, but he himself sprang to the ground unharmed. Several of the men fed at this first fire. The testimony of the survivors of this sanguinary engagement is, that their brave com mander was as cool and codected as d on dress pa rade. They retreated down the stream about a mile and a half, fighting their way inch by inch, when it was discovered that a body of Indians, taking advantage of the fact that there was a bend in the river, had gone across and gained the bank below them. them who were unable to cross remained in the grass and bushes untd night, when they made their way, also, to the fort or settlements. Some of them were badly wounded, and were out two or three days before they got in. Two weeks after ward, Josiah F. Marsh, brother of the cap tain, with a mounted escort of thirty men \u2014 his old neighbors from Fidmore county \u2014 made search for his body, but without success. On the day before and the day after this search, as was sub sequently ascertained, two hundred Indians were scouting along the river, upon the the very ground over which these thirty men passed, in their fruit less search for the remains of their dead brother and friend. Two weeks later another search was made with boats along the river, and this time the search was successful. His body was discovered a mile and a half below where he was kided, under the roots of a tree standing at the water's edge. His remains were borne by his sorrowing com panions to Fort Ridgley, and deposited in the military burial-ground at that place. This gallant officer demands more than a pass ing notice. When the Southern rebellion broke out, in 1861, John S. Marsh was residing in Fid more county, Minnesota. A company was re cruited in his neighborhood, designed for the gal lant 1st Minnesota, of which he was made first deutenant. Before, however, this company reach ed Fort Snelling, the place of rendezvous, the reg iment was full, and it was disbanded. The patri otic fire stdl burned in the soul of young Marsh. Going to La Crosse, he volunteered as a private in the 2d Wisconsin regiment, and served some ten months in the ranks. In the fodowing winter his brother, J. F. Marsh, assisted in raising a com pany in Fidmore county, of which John S. was elected first lieutenant, and he was therefore trans ferred, by order of the Secretary of War, to his company, and arrived at St. Paul about the 12th of March, 1862. In the meantime, Captain Gere was promoted to major, and on the 24th Lieuten ant Marsh was promoted to the captaincy of his company, and ordered to report at Fort Ridgely and take command of that important frontier post. Captain Marsh at once repaired to his post of dutv, where he remained in command until the fatal encounter of the 18th terminated both his usefulness and life. He was a brave and accom plished soldier, and a noble man, The heroic little band was already reduced to about one-half its original number. To cut their way through this large number of Indians was impossible. Their only hope now was to cross the river to the reservation, as there appeared to be no Indians on that shore, retreat down that side and recross at the fort. The river was supposed to be fordable where they were, and, accordingly, Capt. Marsh gave the order to cross. Taking his sword in one hand and his revolver in the other, accom panied by his men, he waded out into the stream. It was very soon ascertained that they must swim, when these who could not do so returned to the shore and hid in the grass as best they could, while those who could, dropped their arms and struck out for the opposite side. Among these latter was Capt. Marsh. When near the opposite shore he was struck by a bad, and immediately sank, but arose again to the surface, and grasped the shoulder of a man at his side, but the garment gave way in his grasp, and he again sank, this time to rise no more. Thirteen of the men reached the bank in safety, and returned to the fort that night.

One of the guns was placed in charge of a citizen named J. C. Whipple, an old artiderist, who had seen service in the Mex ican war, and in the United States navy, and had made his escape from the massacre at the Lower Agency, and one in charge of Sergeant McGrew, of Company C; the other in charge of Sergeant Jones in person. In this assault there were, prob ably, not less than five hundred warriors, led by their renowned chief, Little Crow. SIEGE OF FORT RIDGELY. Foded in their attack on New Ulm by the timely arrival of reinforcements under Flandrau, the Indians turned their attention toward Fort Ridgely, eighteen miles north-west. On Wednes day, at three o'clock P. M., the 20th of August, they suddenly appeared in great force at that post, and at once commenced a furious assault upon it. The fort is situated on the edge of the prairie, about half a mile from the Minnesota river, a timbered bottom intervening, and a wooded ra vine running up out of the bottom around two sides of the fort, and within about twenty rods of the buildings, affording shelter for an enemy on three sides, within easy rifle or musket range. So sudden had been the outbreak, and so weak was the garrison that there had been no time to construct any defensive works whatever, or to re move or destroy the wooden structures and hay stacks, behind which the enemy could take position and shelter. The magazine was situated some twenty rods outside the main works on the open prairie. Men were at once detailed to take the ammunition into the fort. Theirs was the post of danger; but they passed through the leaden storm unscathed. The first knowledge the garrison had of the presence of the foe was given by a volley from the ravine, which drove in the pickets. The men were instantly formed, by order of Lieutenant Sheehan, in line of battle, on the parade-ground inside the works. Two men, Mark M. Grear, of Company C, and William Goode, of Company B, fell at the first fire of the concealed foe, after the line was formed; the former was instantly killed, the latter badly wounded, both being shot in the head. Robert Baker, a citizen, who had escaped from the massacre at the Lower Agency, was shot through the head and instantly killed, while standing at a window in the barracks, at about the same time. The men soon broke for shelter, and from behind boxes, from windows, from the shelter of the buildings, and from every spot where concealment was possible, watched their opportunities, wasted no ammunition, but poured their shots with deadly effect upon the wily and savage foe whenever he suffered himsed to be seen. In the rear of the barracks was a ravine up which the St. Peter road passed. The enemy had poses sion of this ravine and road, while others were posted in the buildings, at the windows, and in sheltered portions in the sheds in the rear of the officer's quarters. Here they fought from 3 o'clock until dark, the artillery all the while sheding the ravine at short range, and the rifles and muskets of the men dropping the yelling demons like au tumn leaves. In the meantime the Indians had got into some of the old out-buildings, and had crawled up behind the hay-stacks, from which they poured heavy volleys into the fort. A few well-di rected shells from the howitzers set them on fire, and when night closed over the scene the lurid hght of the burning builehngs shot up with a fit ful glare, and served the purpose of revealing to the wary sentinel the lurking foe should he again appear. The forces in the fort at this time were the rem nant of Company B, 5th Regiment M. V, Lieu tenant Culver, thirty men; about fifty men of Company C, same regiment, Lieutenant T. J. Sheehan; the Renvdle Rangers, Lieutenant James Gorman, numbering fifty men, ad under command of Lieutenant T. J. Sheehan. The Indians retired with the closing day, and were seen in large numbers on their ponies, mak ing their way rapidly toward the Agency. The great danger feared by all was, that, under cover of the darkness, the savages might creep up to the buildings and with fire-arrows ignite the dry roofs of the wooden structures. But about midnight the heavens opened and the earth was deluged with rain, effectually- preventing the consumma tion of such a design, if it was intended. As the first great drops fed on the faces uptiuued to the Sergeant John Jones, of the regular army, a brave and skillful man, was stationed at this fort as post-sergeant, in charge of the ordnance, and took immecdate command of the artidery, of which there were in the fort six pieces. Three only, how ever, were used \u2014 two six-pounder howitzers and one twenty-four-pounder field-piece. A sufficient number of men had been detailed to work these"], [237, "FORT RIDGELY ATTACKED. 223 gathering heavens the glad shout of \"Rain! rain! thank God! thank God!\" went round the beleag uered garrison. Stout-hearted, strong-armed men breathed free again; and weary, frightened women and children slept once more in comparative safety. let loose from the bottomless pit; but the brave men in that sore pressed garrison, knowing full wed that to be taken alive was certain death to themselves and all within the doomed fort, each man was promptly at his post. In this engagement there were two men killed, and nine wounded, and ad the government mules were stampeded by the Indians. Jack Frazer, an old resident in the Indian country, volunteered as a bearer of dispatches to Governor Ramsey, and availing himself of the darkness and the furious storm, made his way safely out of the fort, and reached St. Peter, where he met Colonel Sibley and his command on their way to the relief of the fort. The main attack was directed against that side of the works next to the river, the buddings here being frame structures, and the most vulnerable part of the fort. This side was covered by the stable, granary, and one or two old buildings, besides the sutler's store on the west side, yet standing, as wed as the buildings named above. Made bold by their augmented numbers, and the non- arrival of reinforcements to the garrison, the Indians pressed on, seemingly determined to rush at once into the works, but were met as they reached the end of the timber, and swept round up the ravine with such a deadly fire of musketry poured upon them from behind the barracks and the windows of the quarters, and of grape, canister and shell from the guns of the brave and heroic Jones, Whipple, and McGrew, that they beat a hasty retreat to the friendly shelter of the bottom, out of musket range. But the shells continued to scream wddly through the air, and burst around and among them. They soon raided and took possession of the stable and other out-buildings on the south side of the fort, from which they poured terrific vodeys upon the frail wooden buddings on that side, the bullets actually passing through their sides, and through the partitions inside of them. Here Joseph Vanosse, a citizen, was shot through the body by a ball which came through the side of the budding. They were soon driven from these buildings by the artidery, which sheded them out, setting the buildings on fire. The sutler's store was in like manner shelled and set on fire. The scene now became grand and terrific. The flames and smoke of the burning buddings, the wdd and demoniac yells of the savage besiegers, the roaring of cannon, the screaming of shells as they hurtled through the air, the sharp crack of the rifle, and the unceasing rattle of musketry presented an exhibition never to be forgotten by those who witnessed it. Rain continued to fad until nearly night of Thursday, when it ceased, and that night the stars looked down upon the weary, but still wakeful and vigdant watchers in Fort Ridgely. On that night a large quantity of oats, in sacks, stored in the granary near the stable, and a quantity of cord wood piled near the fort, were disposed about the works in such a manner as to afford protection to the men, in case of another attack. The roof of the commissary building was covered with earth, as a protection against fire-arrows. The water in the fort had given out, and as there was neither well nor cistern in the works, the garrison were depend ent upon a spring some sixty rods distant in the ravine, for a supply of that indispensable element. Their only resource now was to dig for water, which they did at another and less exposed point, and by noon had a supply sufficient for two or three days secured inside the fort. In the meantime the small arm's ammunition having become nearly exhausted in the battle of Wednesday, the balls were removed from some of the spherical case-shot, and a party of men and women made them up into cartridges, which were greatly needed. Small parties of Indians had been seen about the fort, out of range, during Thursday and Friday forenoon, watching the fort, to report if reinforcements had reached it. At about 1 o'clock in the afternoon of Friday, the 22d, they appeared again in force, their numbers greatly augmented, and commenced a furious and most de termined assault. They came apparently from the Lower Agency, passing down the Minnesota bot tom, and round into the ravine surrounding the fort. As they passed near the beautiful residence of R. H. Randall, post sutler, they applied the torch and it was soon wrapped in flames. On came the painted savages yelling like so many demons The Indians retired hastdy from the burning buildings, the men in the fort sending a shower of bullets among them as they disappeared over the bluffs toward the bottom. With wild yells they now circled round into the ravine, and from the tall grass, lying on their faces, and from the shelter of the timber, continued the battle tid"], [238, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 224 night, their leader, Little Crow, vainly ordering them to charge on the guns. They formed once for that purpose, about sundown, but a shell and round of canister sent into their midst closed the contest, when,with an unearthly yell of rage and dis appointment, they left. These shots, as was after wards ascertained, killed and wounded seventeen of their number. Jones continued to shed the ravine and timber around the fort until after dark, when the firing ceased, and then, as had been done on each night before, since the investment of the fort, the men ad went to their several posts to wait and watch for the coming of the wily foe. The night waned slowly ; but they must not sleep; their foe is sleepless, and that wide area of dry shingled roof must be closely scanned, and the approaches be vigdantly guarded, by which he may, under cover of the darkness, creep upon them unawares. dead and wounded. Our own fallen heroes were buried on the edge of the prairie near the fort; and the injuries of the wounded men were care fully attended to by the skdlful and excedent post surgeon, Dr. Alfred Muder. We close our account of this protracted siege by a slight tribute on behalf of the sick and wounded in that garrison, to one whose name wid ever be mentioned by them with love and respect. The hospitals of Sebastopol had their Florence Nightingale, and over every blood-stained field of the South, in our own struggle for national -life, hovered angels of mercy, cheering and soothing the sick and wounded, smoothing the pillows and closing the eyes of our fallen braves. And when, in after years, the brave men who fell, sorely wounded, in the battles of Fort Ridgely, Birch Coolie, and Wood Lake, fighting against the savage hordes who overran the borders of our beautiful State, in August and September, 1862, carrying the flaming torch, the gleaming toma hawk, and bloody scalping-knife to hundreds of peaceful homes, shall tell to their children and children's children the story of the \"dark and bloody ground\" of Minnesota, and shad exhibit to them the scars those wounds have left; they will tell, with moistened cheek and swelling hearts of the noble, womanly deeds of Mrs. Eliza Muder, the \"Florence Nightingale\" of Fort Ridgely. [Mrs. Muder several years since died at the asylum at St. Peter.] Morning broke at last, the sun rode up a clear and cloudless sky, but the foe came not. The day passed away, and no attack; the night again, and then another day; and yet other days and nights of weary, sleepless watching, but neither friend nor foe approached the fort, untd about daylight on Wednesday morning, the 27th, when the cry was heard from the look-out on the roof, \"There are horsemen coming on the St. Peter road, across the ravine!\" Are they friends or foes? was the ques tion on the tongues of all. By their cautious movements they were evidently reconnoitering, and it was yet too dark for those in the fort to be able to tell, at that distance, friends from foes. But as daylight advanced, one hundred and fifty mounted men were seen dashing through the ra vine; and amidst the wild hurras of the assembled garrison, Colonel Samuel McPhad, at the head of two companies of citizen-cavalry, rode into the fort. In command of a company of these men were Anson Northrup, from Minneapolis, an old frontiers-man, and R. H. Chittenden, of the First Wisconsin Cavalry. This force had ridden all night, having left St. Peter, forty-five miles dis tant, at 6 o'clock the night before. From them the garrison learned that heavy reinforcements were on their way to their relief, under Colonel (now Brigadier-General) H. H. Sibley. The worn out and exhausted garrison could now sleep with a feeling of comparative security. The number of killed and wounded of the enemy is not known, but must have been considerable, as, at the close of each battle, they were seen carrying away their SERGEANT JOHN JONES. We feel that the truth of history wdl not be fully vindicated should we fail to bestow upon a brave and gallant officer that meed of praise so justly due. The only officer of experience left in the fort by the death of its brave commandant was Ser geant John Jones, of the regular artdlery ; and it is but just to that gadant officer that we should say that but for the cool courage and discretion of Sergeant Jones, Fort Ridgely would, in the first day's battle have become a funeral pyre for ad within its doomed walls. And it gives us more than ordinary pleasure to record the fact, that the services he then rendered the Government, in the defense of the frontier were fully recognized and rewarded with the commission of Captain of the Second Minnesota Battery."], [239, "CAPTAIN WHITCOMD AT FOREST CITY. 225 state, with the exception of those left by him. at Hutchinson. Upon his arrival he speedily en listed, for temporary service, a company of filty three men. twenty-five of whom were mounted, and the remainder were to act as infantry. CHAPTER XXXIX. CAPTAIN WHITCOMB'S ARRIVAL AT ST. PAUL PASSES THROUGH MEEKER COUNTY \u2014 A FORT CONSTRUCTED \u2014ENGAGEMENT WITH INDIANS ATTACK ON FOREST CITY CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY CAPTAIN STROUT AT GLENCOE ATTACKED NEAR ACTON BY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY INDIANS ATTACK ON HUTCHINSON. Captain Whitcomb, with the mounted portion of his company, made a rapid march into the county of Monoagalia, to a point about thirty mdes from Forest City, where he found the bodies of two men who had been shot by the Indians, who had muti lated the corpses by cutting their throats and scalping them. In the same vicinity he found the ruins of three houses that had been burned, and the carcasses of a large number of cattle that had been wantonly killed and devoted to destruction. This chapter will be devoted to the upper por tion of the state, and the movements of troops for the relief of the frontier, not immediately con nected with the main expedition under Colonel Sibley; and to avoid repetition, the prominent in cidents of the massacre in this portion of the state will be given in connection with the movements of the troops. We quote from the Adjutant-Gen eral's Report: Owing to rumors received at this point, he pro ceeded in a north-westerly direction, to the distance of ten miles further, and found on the route the remains of five more of the settlers, all of whom had been shot and scalped, and some of them were otherwise mutilated by having their hands cut off and gashes cut in their faces, done apparently with hatchets. The 19th day of August the first news of the outbreak at Redwood was received at St. Paul. On the same day a messenger arrived from Meeker county, with news of murders committed in that county by the Indians, and an earnest demand for assistance. The murders were committed at Ac ton, about twelve miles from Forest City, on Sun day, the 17th day of the month. The circum stances under which these murders were committed are fully detailed in a previous chapter. On the return to camp at Forest City, when within about four mdes of Acton, he came to a point on the road where a train of wagons had been attacked on the 23d. He here found two more dead bodies of white men, mutilated in a shocking manner by having their hands cut off, being dis emboweled and otherwise disfigured, having knives still remaining in their abdomens, where they had been left by the savages. The road at this place was, for three miles, dned with the carcasses of dead cattle, a great portion of which belonged to the train upon which the attack had been made. On this excursion the company were about four days, during which time they traveled over one hundred miles, and buried the bodies of nine per sons who had been murdered. George C. Whitcomb, commander of the state forces raised in the county of Meeker, was sta tioned at Forest City. On the 19th of August, Mr. Whitcomb arrived at St. Paul, and received from the state seventy-five stand of arms and a small quantity of ammunition, for the purpose of enabling the settlers of Meeker county to stand on the defensive, until other assistance could be sent to their aid. With these in his possession, he started on his return, and, .on the following day he met Col. Sibley at Shakopee, by whom he was or dered to raise a company of troops and report with command to the Colonel, at Fort Ridgely. On ar riving at Hutchinson, in McLeod county, he found the whole country on a general stampede, and small bands of Indians lurking in the border of Meeker county. On the next day after having returned to the camp, being the 28th of the month, the same party made a circuit through the western portion of Meeker county, and buried the bodies of three more men that were found mutilated and disfigured in a similar manner to those previously mentioned. In addition to the other services rendered by the company thus far, they had discovered and re moved to the camp several persons found wounded and disabled in the vicinity, and two, who had been very severely wounded, had been sent by them to St. Cloud for the purpose of receiving surgical attention. Captain Richard Strout was ordered, under date of August 24, to proceed with a company of men to Forest City, in the county of Meeker, for the protection of that locality. In the meantime Captain Whitcomb arrived at Forest City with the arms furnished him by the 15"], [240, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 226 ority of the enemy's forces, the Captain withdrew his men. They fell gradually back, fighting steadily on the retreat, and were pursued to within four miles of the encampment. In this contest, one Indian is known to have been killed. On the part of the whites one horse and wagon got mired in a slough, and had to be abandoned. No other injury was suffered from the enemy; but two men were wounded by the accidental discharge of a gun in their own ranks. The company, in addition to their other labors, were employed in the construction of a stockade fort, to be used d necessary for defensive purposes, and for the protection of those who were not capa ble of bearing arms. It was formed by inserting the ends of pieces of rough timber into the earth to the depth of three feet, and leaving them from ten to twelve feet above the surface of the ground. In this way an area was inclosed of one hundred and forty feet in length and one hundred and thirty in width. Within the fortification was in cluded one frame dwelling-house and a well of water. At diagonal corners of the inclosure were erected two wings or bastions provided with port holes, from each of which two sides of the main work could be guarded and raked by the rifles of th,e company. A fortification was prepared, and the citizens, with their families, were removed within the inclosure. Captain Whitcomb quartered his com pany in the principal hotel of the place, and guards were stationed for the night, whde all the men were directed to be prepared for any contin gency that might arise, and be in readiness for using their arms at any moment. Information was received by Captain Whitcomb that a family at Green Lake, in Monongalia county, near the scenes visited by him in his expedition to that county, had made their escape from the In dians, and taken refuge upon an island in the lake. In attempting to rescue this family Captain Whit comb had a severe encounter with Indians found in ambush near the line of Meeker county, and after much skirmishing and a brisk engagement, which proved very much to the disadvantage of the Indians, they succeeded in effecting their es cape to the thickly -timbered region in the rear of their first position. The members of the company were nearly ad experienced marksmen, and the Springfield rifles in their hands proved very gall ing to the enemy. So anxious was the latter to effect his retreat, that he left three of his dead upon the ground. No loss was sustained on the part of our troops, except a flesh-wound in the leg received by one of the company. As it was deemed unadvisable to pursue the Indians into the heavy timber with the small force at command, the detachment fell back to their camp, arriving the same evening. Between 2 and 3 o'clock the following morning, the guards discovered the approach of Indians, and gave the alarm. As soon as the savages per ceived that they were discovered, they uttered the war-whoop, and poured a volley into the hotel where the troops were quartered. The latter immediately retired to the stockade, taking with them all the ammunition and equipments in their possession. They had scarcely effected an en trance when fire was opened upon it from forty or fifty Indian rifles. Owing to the darkness of the morning, no distinct view could be obtained of the enemy, and, in consequence, no very effective fire could be opened upon him. While one party of the Indians remained to keep up a fire upon the fort and harass the garrison, another portion was engaged in setting fire to buildings and haystacks, while others, at the same time, were engaged in collecting horses and cattle found in the place, and driving them off. Occa sional glimpses could be obtained of those near the fires, but as soon as a shot was fired at them they would disappear in the darkness. Most of the buildings burned, however, were such a dis tance from the fort as to be out of range of the guns of the garrison. The fire kept up from that point prevented the near approach of the incen diary party, and by that means the principal part of the town was saved from destruction. On one occasion an effort was made to carry the flames into a more central part of the town, and the torches in the hands of the party were seen approaching the office of A. C. Smith, Esq. Directed by the light of the torches, a volley was On the fodowing day, Capfain Whitcomb, taking with him twenty men from his company, and twenty citizens who volunteered for the occa sion, proceeded on the same route taken the day previous. With the increase in his forces he expected to be able, without much difficulty, to overcome the Indians previously encountered. After proceeding about ten miles from the camp, their further progress was again disputed by the Indians, who had likewise been reinforced since their last encounter. Owing to the great superi-"], [241, "CAPTAIN STROUTS PARTY ATTACKED. 227 poured into their midst from the fort, whereupon the braves hastily abandoned their incendiary implements and retreated from that quarter of the village. From signs of blood afterward found upon the ground, some of the Indians were sup posed to have met the fate intended for them, but no dead were left behind. not hesitate to advise, nor Captain Strout to at tempt a further advance into the overrun and threatened territory. The company of the latter, by this time, had been increased by persons, principally from Wright county, who volunteered their services for the ex pedition, untd it numbered about seventy-five men. With this force he marched, as already stated, on the 1st day of September. The fight continued, without other decided re sults, until about daylight, at which time the prin cipal part of the forces retired. As the light in creased, so that objects became discernible, a small party of savages were observed engaged in dri ving off a number of cattle. A portion of the garrison, volunteering for the purpose, sallied out to recover the stock, which they accomplish ed, with the loss of two men wounded, one of them severely. Passing through Hutchinson on his way, no op position was encountered untd the morning of the 3d of September. On the night previous, he had arrived at and encamped near Acton, on the west ern border of Meeker county. At about half-past five o'clock the next morning his camp was attacked by a force comprising about one hundred and fifty Indians. The onset was made from the direction of Hutchinson, with the design, most probably, of cutting off the retreat of the company, and of precluding the.possibdity of sending a messenger after reinforcements. They fought with a spirit and zeal that seemed determ ined to annihilate our dttle force, at whatever cost it might require. This company had no further encounters with the Indians, but. afterward engaged in securing the grain and other property belonging to the set tlers who had abandoned, or been driven from, their farms and homes. Nearly every settlement be tween Forest City and the western frontier had, by this time, been deserted, and the whole country was in the hands of the savages. In speaking of his endeavors to save a portion of the property thus abandoned, Captain Whitcomb, on the 7th of September, wrote as follows: For the first half hour Captain Strout formed his company into four sections, in open order, and pressed against them as skirmishers. Finding their forces so much superior to his own, he concentra ted the force of his company, and hurled them against the main body of the enemy. In this manner the fight was kept up for another hour and a half, the Indians falling slowly back as they were pressed, in the direction of Hutchinson, but maintaining all the while their order and line of battle. At length the force in front of the compa ny gave way, and falling upon the rear, continued to harrass it in its retreat. \"It is only in their property that the inhabitants can now be injured; the people have all fled. The country is totally abandoned. Not an inhab itant remains in Meeker county, west of this place. No white person (unless a captive) is now hving in Kandiyohi or Monongalia county.\" On the 1st of September, Captain Strout, who had previously arrived at Glencoe, made prepara tions for a further advance. Owing to the vigor ous measures adopted by General John H. Stevens, of the State militia, it was thought unnecessary that any additional forces should be retained at this point. Under his directions no able-bodied man having deserted the country further to the westward, had been permitted to leave the neigh borhood, or pass through. Ad such were re quired to desist from further flight, and assist in making a stand, in order to check the further advance of the destroyers of their homes. The town of Glencoe had been fortified to a certain extent, and a military company of seventy-three members had been organized, and armed with such guns as were in possession of the settlers. With Glencoe thus provided for, General Stevens did About one-half of the savages were mounted, partly on large, fine horses, of which they had plundered the settlements, and partly on regular Indian ponies. These latter were so wed trained for the business in which they were now engaged, that their riders would drive them at a rapid rate to within any desirable distance of our men, when pony and rider would both instantly he down in the tall grass, and thus become concealed from the aim of the sharp-shooters of the company. With the intention, most likely, of creating a panic in our ranks, and causing the force to scat ter, and become separately an easy prey to the pursuers, the Indians would at times, uttering the most terrific and unearthly yeds of which their"], [242, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 228 lungs and skill were capable, charge in a mass upon the little band. On none of these occasions, however, did a single man falter or attempt a flight; and, after approaching within one hundred yards of the retreating force, and perceiving that they still remained firm, the Indians would halt the charge, and seek concealment in the grass or elsewhere, from which places they would continue their fire. 4th of September, the Indians approached the town thus garrisoned and commenced the attack. They were replied to from the fortification; but, as they were careful not to come within close range, and used every means to conceal their per sons, but dttle punishment was inflicted upon them. They bent their energies more in attempts to burn the town than to inflict any serious injury upon the military. In these endeavors they were so far successful as to burn all the buildings sit uated on the bluff in the rear of the town, includ ing the college building, which was here located. They atone time succeeded in reaching almost the heart of the village, and applying the incendiary torch to two of the dwelhng-houses there situated, which were consumed. After having thus hung upon and harrassed the rear of the retreating force for about half an hour, at the end of which time the column had arrived within a short distance of Cedar City, in the extreme north-west corner of McLeod county, the pursuit was given up, and the company continued the retreat without further opposition to Hutchin son, at which place it arrived at an early hour in the same afternoon. Our forces marched out of the fort and engaged them in the open field; but, owing to the superior numbers of the enemy, and theif scattered and hidden positions, it was thought that no advantage could be gained in this way, and, after driving them out of the town, the soldiers were recalled to the fort. The day was spent in this manner, the Indians making a succession of skirmishes, but at the same time endeavoring to maintain a sufficient distance between them and the soldiers to insure an almost certain impunity from the fire of their muskets. At about five o'clock in the evening their forces were withdrawn, and our troops rested on their arms, in expectation of a renewal of the fight in a more desperate form. The loss of the company ii the encounter was three men kided. and fifteen wounded, some of them severely. All were, however, brought from the field. In addition to this they lost most of their ra tions, cooking uteusils, tents, and a portion of their ammunition and arms. Some of their horses became unmanageable and ran away. Some were mired and abandoned, making, with those killed by the enemy, an aggregate loss of nine. The loss inflicted upon the enemy could not be de termined with any degree of certainty, but Cap tain Strout was of the opinion that their killed and wounded were two or three times as great as ours. As soon as General Stevens was informed of the attack made upon Captain Strout, near Acton, and his being compelled to fall back to Hutchinson, be directed Captain Davis to proceed to the com mand of Lieutenant Weinmann, then stationed near Lake Addie, in the same county, to form a junction of the two commands, and proceed to Hutchinson and reinforce the command of Captain Strout. At Hutchinson a military company, consisting of about sixty members, had been organized for the purpose of defending the place against any attacks from the Indians. Of this company Louis Har rington was elected captain. On the first appre hension of danger a house was barricaded as a last retreat in case of necessity. The members of the company, aided by the citizens, afterward con structed a small stockade fort of one hundred feet square. It was built after the same style as that at Forest City, with bastions in the same position, and a wall comoosed of double timbers rising to the height of eight feet above the ground. The work was provided with loop-holes, from which a musketry fire could be kept up, and was of suffi cient strength to resist any projectiles that the sav ages hal the means of throwing. At this place Captain Strout halted his company, to await fur ther devel'pments. On the morning of the 4th of September the pickets belonging to Lieutenant Weinmann's com mand reported having heard firing in the direction of Hutchinson. The Lieutenant immediately as cended an eminence in the vicinity of his camp, and from that point could distinguish the smoke from six different fires in the same direction. Being satisfiel from these indications that an at tack had been made upon Hutchinson, he deter mined at once to march to the assistance of the place. Leaving behind him six men to collect the teams and follow with the wagons, he started with At about nine o'clock on the next morniag, the"], [243, "MORE SAVAGE DAtlDARlTlES. 229 the remainder of his force in the direction indi cated. direction of Cedar City came in, having been at tacked near Greenleaf, and one of their number, a member of Captain Harrington's company, killed and left upon the ground. They reported having seen about twenty Indians, having kdled one. and their belief that more were in the party. The scouts from nearly every direction reported having seen Indians, some of them in considerable num bers, and the country all around seemed at once to have become infested with them. Some time after he had commenced his march the company of Captain Davis arrived at the camp he had just left. Upon learning the state of affairs, the mounted company followed in the same direction, and, in a short time, came up with Lieutenant Weinmann. A junction of their forces was immediately effect ed, and they proceeded in a body to Hutchinson, at which place they arrived about 6 o'clock in the evening. No Indians had been encountered on the march, and the battle, so long and so diligently kept up during most of the day, had just been terminated, and the assailing forces withdrawn. A reconnoissance, in the immediate vicinity, was made from the fort on the same evening, but none of the Indians, who, a few hours before, seemed to be everywhere, could be seen; but the bodies of three of their victims, being those of one woman and two children, were found and brought to the village. On the 5th of September, Lieutenant William Byrnes, of the Tenth Regiment Minnesota Volun teers, with a command of forty-seven men, started from Minneapolis, wh\u00a3re his men were recruited, for service in Meeker and McLeod counties. Upon his arrival in the country designated, he was finally stationed at Kingston, in the county of Meeker, for the purpose of affording protection to that place and vicinity. He quartered his men in the storehouse of Hall & Co., which had been pre viously put in a state of defense by the citizens of the place. He afterward strengthened the place by means of earth- works, and made daily examina tions of the surrounding country by means of scouts. On the following morning, six persons arrived at the fortification, who had been in the midst of and surrounded by the Indians during the greater part of the day before, and had succeeded in con cealing themselves until they retired from before the town, and finally effected their escape to the place. Capt. Pettit, of the Eighth Regiment Minnesota Volunteers, was, about the same time, sent to re inforce Captain Whitcomb, of Forest City, at which place he was stationed at the time of the sudden reappearance of the Indians in the country. On the 22dof September word was brought to Forest City that the Indians were committing depreda tions at Lake Ripley, a point some twelve miles to the westward of that plaee. Captain Pettit there upon sent a messenger to Lieutenant Byrnes, re questing his co-operation, with as many of his command as could leave their post in safety, for the purpose of marching into the invaded neigh borhood. The companies of Captain Davis and Lieuten ant Weinmann made a tour of examination in the direction that the Indians were supposed to have taken. All signs discovered seemed to indicate that they had left the vicinity. Their trail, indi cating that a large force had passed, and that a number of horses and cattle had been taken along, was discovered, leading in the direction of Redwood. As the battle of Birch Coolie had been sought two or three days previous, at which time the Indians first learned the great strength of the column threatening them in that quarter, it is most likely that the party attacking Hutchinson had been called in to assist in the endeavor to repel the forces under Colonel Sibley. In pursuance of orders, Lieutenant Byrnes, with thirty-six men, joined the command of Capt Pettit on the same evening. On the next morning, the 23d of September, the same day that Captain Strout's scouting party was attasked at Greenleaf, Captain Pettit, with the command of Lieutenant Bvrnes and eighty-seven men, from the post at Forest City, marched in the direction in which the Indians hail been reported as committing depre dations on the previous day. Four mounted men of Captain Whitcomb's force accoimpanied the party as guides. On the 23d of September the Indians suddenly reappeared in the neighborhood. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon a messenger arrived, with dis patches from Lieutenant Weinmann, informing Captain Strout that Samuel White and family, residing at Lake Addie, had that day been brutally murdered by savages. At about 11 o'clock P. M., the scouts from the On arriving at the locality of repo:ted depreda-"], [244, "230 HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. tions, they found the mutilated corpse of a citizen by the name of Oleson. He had received three shots through the body and one through the hand. Not even satisfied with the death thus in flicted, the savages had removed his scalp, beaten out his brains, cut his throat from ear to ear, and cut out his tongue by the roots. Leaving a de tachment to bury the dead, the main body of ex pedition continued the march by way of Long Lake, and encamped near Acton, where Captain Strout's command was first attacked, and at no great distance from the place where his scouts were attacked. fodowed in the outward march. About ten o'clock the expedition came upon a herd, comprising sixty five head of cattle, which the Indians had codected, and were in the act of driving off, when they were surprised by the near approach of volunteers. As the latter could be seen advancing at a distance of three miles, the Indians had no difficulty in making their escape to the timber, and in this way eluding pursuit from the expedition by abandon ing their plunder. The cattle were driven by the party to Forest City, where a great portion of the herd was found to belong to persons who were then doing mditary duty, or taking refuge from their enemies. Scouts were sent out by Captain Pettit, ad of whom returned without having seen any Indians. Two dwelling-houses had been visited that had been set on fire by the Indians, but the flames had made so little progress as to be capable of being extinguished by the scouts, which was done ac cordingly. Three other houses on the east side of Long Lake had been fired and consumed during the same day. Three women were found, who had been lying in the woods for a number of days, seeking concealment from the savages. They were sent to Forest City for safety. During the early part of the night, Indians were heard driving or collecting cattle, on the opposite side of Long Lake from the encampment. At Rockford, on the Crow river, a considerable force of citizens congregated for the purpose of mutual protection, and making a stand against the savages in case they should advance thus far. A substantial fortification was erected at the place, affording ample means of shelter and protection to those there collected; but we are not aware that it ever became necessary as a place of last resort to the people, nor are we aware that the Indians committed any act of hostilities within the county of Wright. On the 24th of August rumors reached St. Cloud that murders and other depredations had been committed by the Indians near Paynesville, on the border of Steams county, and near the di viding line between Meeker and Monongalia coun ties. A public meeting of the citizens was called at four o'clock in the afternoon, at which, among other measures adopted, a squad, well armed and equipped, was instructed to proceed to Paynes vide, and ascertain whether danger was to be ap prehended in that direction. This party immedi ately entered upon the discharge of their duty, and started to Paynesville the same evening. During the 24th of September the march was continued to Diamond Lake, in Monongalia county. All the houses on the route were found to be ten antless, all the farms were deserted, and every thing of value, of a destructible nature, belonging to the settlers, had been destroyed by the savages. Only one Indian was seen during the day. and he being mounted, soon made his escape into the big woods. The carcasses of cattle, belonging to the citizens, were found in ad directions upon the prairie, where they had been wantonly slaughtered and their flesh abandoned to the natural process of decom position. On the evening of the fodowing day they re turned, and reported that they met at Paynesville the fugitives from Norway Lake, which latter place is situated in Monongalia county, and about seventeen miles in a south-west direction from the former. That, on Wednesday, the 20th day of August, as a family of Swedes, by the name of Lomberg, were returning from church, they were attacked by a party of Indians, and three brothers killed, and another one, a boy, wounded. The father had fourteen shots fired at him, but suc ceeded in making his escape. One of his sons, John, succeeded in bearing off his wounded brother, and making their escape to Paynesville. At break of day, on the morning of the 25th, an Indian was seen by one of the sentinels to rise from the grass and attempt to take a survey of the encampment. He was immediately fired upon when he uttered a yell and disappeared. Captain Pettit thereupon formed his command in order of battle and sent out skirmishers to reconnoiter; but the Indians had decamped, and nothing further could be ascertained concerning them. At seven o'clock the return march to Forest City was commenced, by a route different from that"], [245, "COMPANY FORMED AT ST. CLOUD. 231 On the 24tb, a party went out from Paynesville for the purpose of burying the dead at Norway Lake, where they found, in addition to those of the Lomberg family, two other entire families murdered \u2014 not a member of either left to ted the tale. The clothes had ad been burned from their bodies, while from each had been cut either the nose, an ear or a finger, or some other act of muti lation had been committed upon it. St. Cloud, and about fifteen mdes distant from that place, a determined band of farmers united together, -with a determination never to leave untd driven, and not to be driven by an inferior force. Their locadty was a small prairie, entirely sur rounded by timber and dense thickets, a circum stance that seemed to favor the near approach of the stealthy savage. By concerted action they soon erected a sub stantial fortification, constructed of a double row of timbers, set vertically, and inserted firmly in the ground. The budding was made two stories in height. The upper story was fitted up for the women and children, and the lower was intended for purposes of a more strictly military character. Some of their number were dispatched to the State Capital to obtain such arms and supplies as could be furnished them. Provisions were laid in, and they soon expressed their confidence to hold the place against five hundred savages, and to stand a siege, if necessary. Their determination was not to be thus tested, however. The Indians came into their neighborhood, and committed some smad depredations, but, so far as reported, never exhibited themselves within gunshot of the fort. The party, having buried the dead, thirteen in number, were met by a little boy, who informed them that his father had that day been killed by the savages while engaged in cutting hay in a swamp. They proceeded with the intention of burying the body, but discovered the Indians to be in considerable force around the marsh, and they were compelled to abandon the design. The party beheld the savages in the act of driv ing off forty-four head of cattle, a span of horses, and two wagons; but the paucity of their num bers compelled them to refrain from any attempt to recover the property, or to inflict any punish ment upon the robbers and murderers having it in their possession. A scouting party had been sent to Johanna Lake, about ten miles from Nor way Lake, where about twenty persons had been living. Not a single person, dead or adve, could there be found. Whether they had been kdled, escaped by hasty flight, or been carried off as prisoners, could not be determined from the sur rounding circumstances. As the party were re turning, they observed a man making earnest en deavors to escape their notice, and avoid them by flight, under the impression that they were Indi ans, refusing to be convinced to the contrary by any demonstrations they could make. Upon their attempting to overtake him, he plunged into a lake and swam to an island, from which he coidd not be induced to return. His family were dis covered and brought to Paynesvide, but no infor mation could be derived from them respecting the fate of their neighbors. At Paynesvide the citizens, and such others as sought refuge in the town, constructed a fortifica tion for the purpose of protecting themselves and defending the village; but no description of the work has ever been received at this office, and, I believe, it was soon abandoned. At St. Joseph, in the Watab Vadey, the citizens there codected erected three substantial fortifica tions. These block-houses were built of solid green timber, of one foot in thickness. The structure was a pentagon, and each side was fifty feet in length. They were located at different points of the town, and completely commanded the entrance in ad directions. In case the savages had attacked the town, they must have suffered a very heavy loss before a passage could be effected, and even after an entry had been made, they would have become fair targets for the riflemen of the forts. Beyond them, to the westward, every house is said to have become deserted, and a great por tion of the country ravaged, thus placing them upon the extreme frontier in that direction; but, owing, no doubt, to their activity in preparing the means for effective resistance, they were permitted to remain almost undisturbed. When this report had been made to the citizens of St. Cloud by the returned party, a mounted company, consisting of twenty-five members, was immediately formed, for the purpose of co-oper ing with any forces from Paynesville in efforts to recover and rescue any citizens of the ravaged district. Of this company Ambrose Freeman was elected captain, and they proceeded in the direc tion of Paynesville the next morning at 8 o'clock. Saiik Center, near the north-western corner of At Maine Prairie, a point to the south-west of"], [246, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 232 the county, and situated on the head-waters of the Sauk river, is, perhaps, the most extreme point in this direction at which a stand was made by the settlers. Early measures were taken to perfect a military organization, which was effected on the 25th of August, by the election of Sylvester Ramsdell as captain. The company consisted of over fifty members, and labored under discourag ing circumstances at the outset. The affrighted and panic-stricken settlers, from all places located still further to the north and west, came pouring past the settlement, almost communicating the same feeling to the inhabitants. From Holmes City, Chippewa Lake, Alexandria, Osakis, and West Union, the trains of settlers swept by, seeking safety only in flight, and apparently willing to re ceive it in no other manner. Upon the departure of these troops, many of the more timid were again almost on the verge of despair, and would willingly have retreated from the position they so long held. More courageous councils prevailed, and the same spirit of firmness that refused safety by flight in the first instance, was still unbroken, and prompted the company to further action, and to the performance of other duties in behad of themselves and those who had accepted their proffers of protection. Disease was beginning to make its appearance within the stock ade, where no other enemy had attempted to penetrate, and this fact admonished the company that more extensive and better quarters were required in order to maintain the health of the people. Several plans were submitted for a new stock ade, from which one was selected, as calculated to secure the best means of defense, and at the same time, to afford the most ample and comfortable quarters for the women, children, and invalids, besides permitting the horses and cattle to be secured within the works. In a few days the new fort was completed, inclosing an area of about one acre in extent, the walls of which were constructed of a double row of timbers, principally tamarack poles, inserted firmly in the ground, and rising eleven feet above the surface. These were prop erly prepared with loopholes and other means of protection to those within, and for the repulsion of an attacking party. Assistance was received from the valley of the Ashley river, from Grove Lake, and from West port, in Pope county. A small stockade fort was constructed, and within it were crowded the women and children. The haste with which it was constructed, and the necessity for its early completion, prevented its either being so extensive or so strongly built as the interest and comfort of the people seemed to require. Upon being informed of the exposed situation of the place, and the determination of the settlers to make a united effort to repel the destroyers from their homes, orders were, on the 30th day of Au gust, issued to the commandant at Fort Snelling, directing him, with all due speed, to detail from his command two companies of troops, with in structions to proceed to Sauk Center, for the pur pose of protecting the inhabitants of the Sauk Valley from any attack of hostile Indians, and to co-operate as far as possible with the troops sta tioned at F' rt Abercrombie. When the people had removed their stock and other property within the new fortification, and had been assigned to their new quarters, they for the first time felt really secure and at ease in mind. Had any vigorous attack been made upon the party in their old stockade, they might have saved the lives of the people, but their horses and cattle would most certainly have been driven off or destroyed. Now they felt that there was a chance of safety for their property as we.l as themselves. In obedience to these orders, the companies under command respectively of Captains George G. McCoy, of the Eighth Regiment Minnesota Volunteers, and Theodore H. Barrett, of the Ninth Regiment, were sent forward. Their arrival at the stockade created a thrill of joy in the place, espe cially among the women and children, and all. even the most timid, took courage and rejoiced in their security. Captain Barrett was, shortly afterward, sent with his command in the expedition for the relief of Fort Abercombie, and a short time after ward Captain McCoy, in obedience to orders from General Pope, fell back to St. Cloud. A short time after this work had been completed Captain McCoy, after having rendered services in other parts of the country, was ordered back to Sauk Center. A company from the Twenty fifth Wisconsin Regiment was sent to the same place upon its arrival in the state, and remained there until about the first of December. Two days after the citizens from Grove Lake \u2014 a point some twelve miles to the south-west of Sauk Center \u2014 had cast their lot with the people"], [247, "PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENSE. 233 of the latter place, the night- sentinels of Captain Ramsded's company discovered fires to the south west. Fearing that all was not right in the vicinity of Grove Lake, a party was sent out the next morning to reconnoiter in that neighborhood. They found one dweding-house burned, and others plundered of such things as had attracted the fancy of the savages, while all furniture was left broken and destroyed. A number of the cattle which had not been taken with the settlers when they left, were found killed. this test, however; but the construction of the fort served to give confidence to the citizens, and prevented some from leaving the place that otherwise would have gone, and were engaged in the preparation at the time the work was com menced. On the 22d of September a messenger arrived at St. Cloud from Richmond, in the same county, who reported that, at four o'clock the same morn ing, the Indians had appeared within a mde of the last-mentioned town, and had attacked the house of one of the settlers, killing two chddren and wounding one woman. Upon the receipt of this intelligence Captain McCoy, who was then sta tioned at St. Cloud with forty men of his com mand, got under way for the reported scene of dis turbance at ten o'clock a. m., and was fodowed early in the afternoon by a mounted company of home-guards, under command of Captain Cramer. Upon arriving at Richmond the troops took the trail of the Indians in the direction of Paynes ville, and ad along the road found the dwellings of the settlers in smouldering ruins, and the stock of their farms, even to the poidtry, killed and lying in all directions. Seven of the farm-houses between these two towns were entirely consumed, and one or two others had been fired, but were reached before the flames had made such progress as to be incapable of being extinguished, and these were saved, in a damaged condition, through the exertions of the troops. On arriving at Payne; - vide they found eight dwelling-houses either con sumed or so far advanced in burning as to pre clude the hope of saving them, and all the out buildings of every description had been commit ted to the flames and reduced to ruins. Only two dwelling-houses were left standing in the village. A Mr. Van Eaton, who resided at that place, about the same time, started from Sauk Center, with the intention of revisiting his farm. He is supposed to have fallen into the hands of the sav ages, as he never returned to the fort. Several parties were sent in search of him, but no positive trace could ever be found. At St. Cloud, in the upper part of the town, a small but substantial fortification was erected, and \"Broker's Block\" of buildings was surrounded with a breastwork, to be used in case the citizens should be compelled to seek safety in this manner. In Lower Town a small work was constructed, called Fort Holes. It was located upon a ridge overlooking the \"flat\" and the lower landing on the river. It was circular in form, and was forty- five feet in diameter. The walls were formed by two rows of posts, deeply and firmly set in the ground, with a space of four feet between the rows. Boards were then nailed upon the sides of the posts facing the opposite row, and the inter- space filled and packed with earth, thus forming an earthen wall of four feet in thickness. The structure was then covered with two-inch plank, supported by heavy timbers, and this again with sods, in order to render it fire-proof. In the cen- ter, and above all, was erected a bullet-proof tower, of the \"monitor\" style, but without the means of causing it to revolve, pre])ared with loop-holes for twelve sharp-shooters. This entire structure was inclosed with a breastwork or wall similar to that of the main building, two feet in thickness and ten in height, with a projection outward so as to ren- der it difficult to be scaled. It was pierced for loop-holes at the distance of every five feet. Within this fortification it was intended that the inhabitants of Lower Town should take refuge in case the Indians should make an attack in any considerable force, and where they expected to be able to stand a siege until reinforcements would be able to reach them. They were not put to At Clear Water, on the Mississippi ri e~, bliw St. Cloud, and in the county of Wright, the citizens formed a home guard and built a fortification for their own protection, which is said to have been a good, substantial structure, but no report has been received in regard either to their military force or preparations for defense. Morrison county, which occupies the extreme frontier in this direction, there being no organized county beyond it, we believe, was deserted by but few of its inhabitants. They collected, however, from the various portions of the county, and took position in the town of Little Falls, its capital, where they fortified the court-house, by strength ening its walls and digging entrenchments around"], [248, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 234 immediately commenced. Upon the receipt of this intelligence the guards were doubled, and every method adopted that was likely to insure protec tion against surprises. it. During the night the women and children occupied the inside of the building, while the men remained in quarters or on guard on the outside. In the morning the citizens of the town would return to their habitations, taking with them such of their neighbors as they could accommo date, and detachments of the men would proceed to the farms of some of the settlers and exert them selves in securing the produce of the sod. In dians were seen on several occasions, and some of the people were fired upon by them, but so far as information has been communicated, no lives were lost among the settlers of the county. The Congress of the United States had author ized a treaty to be made with the Red Lake In dians, (Chippewas,) and the officers were already on their way for the purpose of consummating such treaty. A train of some thirty wagons, loaded with goods, and a herd of some two hundred head of cattle, to be used at the treaty by the United States Agent, was likewise on the way, and was then at no great distance from the fort. Early in the morning of the 23d a messenger arrived, and informed the commandant that a band of nearly five hundred Indians had already crossed the Otter Tail river, with the intention of cutting off and capturing the train of goods and cattle in tended for the treaty. Word was immediately sent to those having the goods in charge, and request ing them to take refuge in the fort, which was speedily complied with. Messengers were like wise sent to Breckenridge, Old Crossing, Graham's Point, and all the principal settlements, urging the inhabitants to flee to the fort for safety, as from the weakness of the garrison, it was not pos sible that protection could be afforded them else where. CHAPTER XL.

CLOUD. On the 23d of August the Indians commenced hostilities in the valley of the Red River of the North. This region of country was protected by the post of Fort Abercrombie, situated on the west bank of the river, in Dakota Territory. The troops that had formerly garrisoned the forts had been removed, and sent to aid in suppressing the Southern rebellion, and their place was supplied, as were all the posts within our state, by a de tachment from the Fifth Regiment Minnesota Vol unteers. But one company had been assigned to this point, which was under the command of Cap tain John Van der Horck. About one-half of the company was stationed at Georgetown, some fifty miles below, for the purpose of overawing the In dians in that vicinity, who had threatened some opposition to the navigation of the river, and to de stroy the property of the Transportation Company. The force was thus divided at the commencement of the outbreak. The great majority of the people from the set tlements arrived in safety on the same day, and were assigned to quarters within the fortification. Three men, however, upon arriving at Brecken ridge, refused to go any further, and took posses sion of the hotel of the place, where they declared they would defend themselves and their property without aid from any source. On the evening of the same day a detachment of six men was sent out in that direction, in order to learn, if possible, the movements of the Indians. Upon their arriv ing in sight of Breckenridge they discovered the place to be occupied by a large force of the sav ages. They were likewise seen by the latter, who attempted to surround them, but being mounted, and the Indians on foot, they were enabled to make their escape, and returned to the fort. The division of the company at Georgetown was immediately ordered in; and, on the morning of the 21th, a detachment was sent to Brecken ridge, when they found the place deserted by the Indians, but discovered the bodies of the three men who had there determined to brave the vio lence of the war party by themselves. They had The interpreter at the post, who had gone to Yellow Medicine for the purpose of attending the Indian payment, returned about the 20th of Au gust, and reported that the Indians were becoming exasperated and that he expected hostilities to be"], [249, "FORT ABERCROMBIE. 235 been brutady murdered, and, when found, had chains bound around their ankles, by which it ap peared, from signs upon the floor of the hotel, their bodies at least had been dragged around in the savage war-dance of their murderers, and, per haps, in that very mode of torture they had suf fered a lingering death.

Captain Ramsded thought that, by complying with this request, he would so weaken his own force that he would be unable to hold position at Sauk Center, and that the region of country around would become over run by the enemy, and he refused his consent. Captain Freeman then deemed it necessary to await reinforcements before proceeding any further on his perdous journey. On the same day that orders were issued to the mounted men then assembling at St. Cloud, simi lar orders were issued to those likewise assembling in Goodhue county, under the command of Cap tain David L. Davis, directing them to complete their organization with all speed, and then to pro ceed forthwith to the town of Carver, on the Min nesota river, and thence through the counties of McLeod, Meeker, and Steams, until an intersec tion was made with the stage-route from St. Cloud to Fort Abercrombie, and thence along such stage route to the fort, unless the officers in command became convinced that their services were more greatly needed in some other quarter, in which case they had authority to use discretionary pow ers. This company, likewise, marched, pursuant to orders; but, in consequence of the attacks then being made upon Forest City, Acton, and Hutch inson, they deemed it their duty to render as sistance to the forces then acting in that part of the country. Over fifty citizens capable of bearing arms had taken refuge with the garrison, and willingly be came soldiers for the time being; but many of them were destitute of arms, and none could be furnished them from the number in the possession of the commandant. There was need, however, to strengthen the position with outside intrench ments, and all that could be spared from other duties were employed in labor of that character. On the morning of the 25th of August, messen gers were dispatched from the post to head-quar ters, stating the circumstances under which the garrison was placed, and the danger of a severe attack; but, as all troops that could be raised, and were not indispensable at other points, had been sent to Colonel Sibley, then on the march for the relief of Fort Ridgely, it was impossible at once to reinforce Fort Abercrombie with any troops al ready reported ready for the field. Authority had been given, and it was expected that a considera ble force of mounted infantry for the State ser vice had been raised, or soon would be, at St. Cloud. Our first efforts to reinforce the garrison on the Red River had failed. Upon the fact becoming known at this office, there were strong hopes that two more companies of infantry could be put into the field in a very short time, and, therefore, on the 30th day of August, orders were issued to the commandant of Fort Snelling, directing him to detail two companies, as soon as they could be had, to proceed to Sauk Center, and thence to proceed to Fort Abercrombie, in case their ser vices were not urgently demanded in the Sauk Valley. These companies were, soon after, dis patched accordingly, and it was hoped that, by means of this increased force on the north-western frontier, a sufficiently strong expedition might be formed to effect the reinforcement of Abercrombie. As the place was directly upon the route to Ab ercrombie, it was deemed advisable to send any troops that could be raised there to the assistance of Captain Van der Horck, relying upon our abil ity to have their places shortly filled with troops, then being raised in other parts of the State. Ac cordingly, Captain Freeman, with his company, of about sixty in number, started upon the march; but upon arriving at Sauk Center, he became con vinced, from information there received, that it would be extremely dangerous, if not utterly im possible, to make the march to the fort with so small a number of men. He then requested Cap tain Ramsded, in command of the troops at Sauk Center, to detail thirty men from his command, to be united with his own company, and, with his force so strengthened, he proposed to make the Upon the arrival of these troops at the rendez vous, however, they stdl considered the forces in that vicinity inadequate to the execution of the task proposed.

It was now determined to send forward the remaining available force of the regi ment, to endeavor to effect the project so long delayed, of reinforcing the command of Captain Van der Horck, on the Red River of the North. Orders were accordingly issued to the commandant at Fort Sneding, on the 6th day of September, directing him to fit out an expedition for that pur pose, to be composed, as far as possible, of the troops belonging to the Third Regiment; and Colonel S nith, the commandant at the post, im mediately entered upon the discharge of the duties assigned him in the order. shot dead, and immediately fired upon her, inflect ing the wounds upon her person which she still bore. That then a teamster in the employment of Burbank & Co. appeared in sight, driving a wagon loaded with oats, and they went to attack him, taking with them her grandchild, a boy about eight years of age. That they fired upon the teamster, wounding him in the arm, after which he succeeded in making his escape for that time, and they left her, no doubt believing her to be dead, or, at least, in a dying condition. She was con veyed to the fort, where her wounds were dressed, after which she gradually recovered. A party was sent out, on the 27th of August, to the Old Cross ing, for the purpose of burying the body of her son, which was accompdshed, and on their way to that point they discovered the body of another man who had been murdered, as was supposed, on the 24th. During the time that these efforts had been making for their relief, the garrison at Fort Aber crombie were kept in a state of siege by the sav ages, who had taken possession of the surrounding c mntry in large numbers. On the 25th of August, th\u201e same day that the first messengers were sent from that post, Captain Van der Horck detailed a squad, composed of six men from his company and six of the citizens then in the fort, to proceed to Breckenridge and recover the bodies of the men who had there been murdered. They proceeded, without meeting with any opposition, to the point designated, where they found the bodies, and con signed them to boxes or rough coffins, prepared for the purpose, and were about starting on the return, when they observed what they supposed to be an Indian in the saw-mdl, at that place. A further examination revealed the fact that the object mistaken for an Indian was an old lady by the name of Scott, from Old Crossing, on the Otter Tail, a point distant fifteen miles from Breckenridge. On Saturday, the 30th of August, another small party were sent out, with the intention of going to the Old Crossing for reconnoitering pur poses, and to collect and drive to the fort such cattle and other live stock as could there be found. They had proceeded ten miles on their way, when they ca-~ie upon a party of Indians, in ambush, by whom they were fired upon, aud one of their party killed. The remainder of the squad made their escape unhurt, but with the loss of their baggage wagon, five mules, and their camp equipage. At about two o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, the Indians appeared in large numbers in sight of the fort. At this time nearly all the live stock belonging to the post, as well as that belonging to the citizens then quartered within the work, together with the cattle that had been intended for the treaty in contemplation with the Red Lake Indians, were all grazing upon the prairie in rear of the fort, over a range extending from about one-half mile to three miles from it. The Indians approached boldly within this dis tance, and drove off the entire herd, about fifty hea d of which afterward escaped. They succeeded, however, in taking between one hundred and sev enty and two hundred head of cattle, and about one hundred horses and mules. They made no demonstration against the fort, except their appa rently bold acts of defiance; but, from the weak ness of the garrison in men and arms, no force was sent out to dispute with them the possession of the property. It was mortifying in tho ex treme, especially to the citizens, to be compeded When discovered, she had three wounds on the breast, which she had received from the Indians, at her residence, on the morning of the previous day. Notwithstanding the severity of her wounds, and the fact that she was sixty-five years of age, she made her way on foot and alone, by walking or crawling along the banks of the river, until she arrived, in a wom-out, exhausted, and almost dy ing condition, at the place where she was found. She stated that, on the 2 tth of August, a party of Indians came to her residence, where they were met by her son, a young man, whom they instantly"], [251, "UNS UCC ESS FUL A TTAC K. 237 to look thus quietly on, while they were being robbed of their property, and dare not attempt its rescue, lest the fort should be filled with their ene mies in their absence. means of these the barracks were surrounded with a breastwork of cord-wood, well filled in with earth to the height of eight feet, and this capped with hewn oak timbers, eight inches square, and having port-holes between them, from which a fire could be opened on the advancing foe. This was designed both as a means of protection, in case of attack, and a place of final retreat in case the main fort should by any means be burned or de stroyed, or the garrison shoidd in any manner be driven from it. On the 2d day of September, another reconnoi tering party of eight were sent out in the direction of Breckenridge, who returned, at four o'clock p. m. without having encountered any opposition from the Indians, or without having even seen any ; but brought with them the cattle above spoken of as having escaped from their captors, which were found running at large during their march. On Saturday, the 6th day of September, the same day that an expedition to that point was or dered from the Third Regiment, the fort was a se cond time attacked. Immediately after daybreak on that morning, the Indians, to the number of about fifty, mounted on horseback, made their ap pearance on the open prairie in the rear of the fort. Their intention evidently was, by this bold and defiant challenge, with so smad a force, to in duce the garrison to leave their fortifications and advance against them, to punish their audacity. At daybreak on the following morning, the 3d of September, the garrison was suddenly called to arms by the report of alarm-shots fired by the sen tinels in the vicinity of the stock-yard belonging to the post. The firing soon became sharp and rapid in that direction, showing that the enemy were advancing upon that point with considerable force. The command was shortly after given for all those stationed outside to fall back within the fortification. About the same time, two of the haystacks were discovered to be on fire, which greatly emboldened and inflamed the spirits of the citizens, whose remaining stock they considered to be in extreme jeopardy. They rushed with great eagerness and hardihood to the stables, and as the first two of them entered on one side, two of the -savages had just entered from the other. The fore most of these men killed one of the Indians and captured his gun. The other Indian fired upon ;he second man, wounding him severely in the -.houlder, notwithstanding which, he afterward hot the Indian and finished him with the bayonet. By this time two of the horses had been taken tway and two killed. In becoming satisfied that our troops could not be seduced from their intrenchments, the Indians soon displayed themselves in different directions, and in large numbers. Their principal object of attack in this instance, as on the former occasion, seemed to be the Government stables, seeming de termined to get possession of the remaining horses and cattle at almost any sacrifice, even if they should make no other acquisition. The stables were upon the edge of the prairie, with a grove of heavy timber lying between them and the river. The savages were not slow in per ceiving the advantage of making their approach upon that point from this latter direction. The shores of the river, on both sides, were lined with Indians for a considerable distance, as their war whoops, when they concluded to commence the onset, soon gave evidence. They seemed determ ined to frighten the garrison into a cowardly sub mission, or, at least, to drive them from the out posts, by the amount and unearthliness of their whoops and yeds. They, in turn, however, were saluted and partially quieted by the opening upon them of a six-pounder, and the explosion of a shell in the midst of their ranks. The fight was kept up for about two hours and i had, during which time three of the inmates of the fort were seriously wounded (one of whom af terward died from the wound ) by shots from the enemv; and the commandant received a severe wound in the right arm from an accidental shot, fired by one of his own men. The Indians then \u2022etired without having been able to effect an en trance into the fort, and without having been able to succeed in capturing the stock of horses and cattle, which, most probably, had been the princi pal object of their attack. A large force was led by one of their chiefs from the river through the timber untd they had gained a close proximity to the stables, still under cover of large trees in the grove. When no nearer position could be gained without presenting ther- Active measures were taken to strengthen the outworks of the fort. The principal materials at ,iand were cord-wood and hewn timber, lut of this there was a considerable abundance. By"], [252, "238 HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASS.1CRE. selves in the open ground, they were urged by their leader to make a charge upon the point thus sought to be gained, and take the place by storm. They appeared slow in rendering obedience to his command, whereby they were to expose themselves in an open space intervening between them and the stables. When at length he succeeded in cre ating a stir among them (for it assuredly did not approach the grandeur of a charge), they were met by such a volley from the direction in which they were desired to march that they suddenly re versed their advance, and each sought the body of a tree, behind which to screen himsed from the threatened storm of flying bullets. observed collecting upon a knod on the prairie, at the distance of about half a mile from the fort, with the apparent intention of making a charge. A howitzer was brought to bear upon them, and a shell was planted in their midst, which immediately afterward exploded, filling the air with dust, sand, and other fragments. When this had sufficiently cleared away to permit the knoll to be again seen, the whole troop, horses and riders, had vanished, and could nowhere be discovered. The fight lasted until near noon, when the enemy withdrew, taking with him nearly all his dead. The loss which he sustained could not be fufly as certained, but from the number killed in plain view of the works, and the marks of blood, broken guns, old rags, and other signs discovered where the men had fallen or been dragged away by their companions, it must have been very severe. Our loss was one man kided and two wounded, one of them mortady. As an instance of the manner in which the fight was now conducted, we would mention a part of the personal adventures of Mr. Walter P. Hills, a citizen, who three times came as a messenger from the fort during the time it was in a state of siege. He had just returned to the post with dis patches the evening before the attack was made. He took part in the engagement, and killed his Indian in the early portion of the fight before the enemy was driven across the river. Mr. Hills left the fort the same evening as bearer of dispatches to headquarters at St. Paul, where he arrived in safety on the evening of the 8th of September. He afterward took position at one of the port holes, where he paired off with a particular Sioux warrior, posted behind a tree of his own selection. He, being acquainted with the language to a con siderable extent, saluted and conversed with his antagonist, and as the opportunity was presented, each would fire at the other. This was kept up for about an hour without damage to either party, when the Indian attempted to change his position, so as to open fire from the opposite side of his tree from that which he had been using hitherto. In this maneuver he made an unfortunate exposure of his person in the direction of the upper bastion of the fort. The report of a rifle from that point was heard, and the Indian was seen to make a sudden start backward, when a second and third shot fol lowed in rapid succession, and Mr. Hills beheld his polite opponent stretched a corpse upon the ground. He expressed himself as experiencing a feeling of dissatisfaction at beholding the death of his enemy thus inflicted by other hands than his own, after he had endeavored so long to accom pdsh the same object. Captain Emd A. Buerger was appointed, by special order from headquarters, to take command of the expedition for the relief of Fort Abercrom bie. He had served with some distinction in the Prussian army for a period of ten years. He after ward emigrated to the United States, and be came a resident of the state of Minnesota, taking the oath of allegiance to the Gov ernment of the United States, and making a declaration of his intention to become a citizen. He enlisted in the second company of Minnesota Sharp- Shooters, and was with the company in the battle of Fair Oaks, in Virginia, where he was severely wounded and left upon the field. He was there found by the enemy, and carried to Rich mond as a prisoner of war. After having in a great measure recovered from his wounds, he was paroled and sent to Benton Barracks, in the state of Missouri, where he was sojourning at the time the 3d Regiment was ordered to this state. As the regiment at that time was utterly destitute of com missioned officers, Captain Buerger was designated to take charge and command during the passage from St. Louis, and to report the command at head quarters in this state. Several of the enemy at this point were killed while in the act of skulking from one tree to an other. The artillery of the post was used with considerable effect during the engagement. At one time a number of the enemy's horsemen were From his known experience and bravery, he was selected to lead the expedition to the Red River of the North, for the relief of the garrison at"], [253, "REINFORCEMENTS. 239 Fort Abercrombie. On the 9th of September he was informed, by the commandant at Fort Snell ing, that the companies commanded respectively by Captains George Atkinson and Rolla Banks, together with about sixty men of the Third Regi ment, under command of Sergeant Dearborne, had been assigned to bis command, constituting an aggregate force of about 250 men. On the 19th of September the expedition reached Wyman's Station, at the point where the road enters the \"Alexandria Woods.\" At the setting out of the expedition it was next to impossible to obtain means of transportation for the baggage and supplies necessary for the force. The fitting out of so many other expeditions and detachments about the same time had drawn so heavdy upon the resources of the country, that scarcely a horse or wagon could be obtained, either by contract or impressment. Although Mr. Kimbad, the quarter master of the expedition, had been assiduously engaged from the 8th of September in endeavor ing to obtain such transportation, yet, on the 11th, he had but partially succeeded in his endeavors. The next day (September 10) arms and accou trements were issued to the men, and, before noon of the 11th of September, Captain Atkinson's company and the company formed from the mem bers of the Third Regiment were ready for the march. With these Captain Buerger at once set out, leaving Captain Bank's company to receive their clothing, but with orders to follow after and overtake the others as soon as possible, which they did, arriving at camp and reporting about 3 o'clock the next morning. Captain Buerger had refused longer to delay, and started at once with the means then at hand, leaving directions for others to be sent forward as rapidly as circumstances would adow. The march was much less rapid, for want of this part of the train. These, fortunately, arrived while the com mand was encamped at Wyman's Station, just before the commencement of what was considered the dangerous part of the march. It was also deemed expedient to send the only remaining field-piece belonging to the state along with the expedition, and Lieutenant Robert J. McHenry was, accordingly, appointed to take command of the piece, and was sent after the expedition, which he succeeded in overtaking, near Clear Water, on the 13th of September, and imme diately reported for further orders to the captain commanding the expedition. On the 14th of September, Captains Barrett and Freeman, having united their commands, de termined to make the attempt to redeve Fort Abercrombie, in obedience to previous orders. They broke up camp on the evening of that day, and by evening of the 15th, had reached Lake Amelia, near the old trad to Red River, where they encamped. During the night a messenger arrived at their camp, bearing dispatches from Captain McCoy, advising them of the advance of the expe dition under command of Captain Buerger, by whom they were directed to await further orders. Being detained by heavy rains and muddy roads, the expedition was considerably delayed upon its march, but arrived at Richmond, in Steams county, on the 16th of September, and encamped in a fortification erected at that point by the citizens of the place. Upon his arrival, Cap tain Buerger was informed that the night previous an attack had been made upon the neighboring village of Paynesvide, and a church and school house had been burned, and that, on the day of his arrival, a party of thirty Sioux warriors, wed mounted, had been seen by some of the Richmond home-guards, about three miles beyond the Sauk river at that point. On the 18th they received orders directly from Captain Buerger, directing them to proceed to Wyman's Station, on the Alexandria road, and join his command at that point on the 19th, which was promptly executed. Captain Buerger expressed himself as being highly pleased v,i.h these companies, both officers and men. He had been directed to assume command over these companies, and believing the country in his rear to be then sufficiently guarded, and being so w-ell pleased with both companies that he disliked to part with either, he ordered them to join the ex pedition during the remainder of the march. Captain Buerger thereupon detailed a party of twenty men to proceed to Richmond, to patrol up and down the bank of the river as far as the town site extended, and, in case of an attack being made, to render ad possible or necessary assistance and aid to the home militia; at the same time he held the remainder of his command in readiness to meet any emergency that might arise. No In dians appeared during the night, and, on the morning fodowing, the march was resumed. By the accession of these companies the strength of the expedition was increased to something over four hundred effective men. This whole force,"], [254, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 240 with the entire train, marched on the 20th of Sep tember, and passed through the \"Alexandria Woods\" without seeing any Indians. After pass ing Sauk Center, however, there was not an inhab itant to be seen, and the whole country had been laid waste. The houses were generally burned, and those that remained had been plundered of their contents and broken up, until they were mere wrecks, while the stock and produce of the farms had been all carried off or destroyed. of Captain Freeman's company, under command of Lieutenant Taylor, and twenty from the members of the Third Regiment, the latter to act as skir mishers in the woods, was directed to cross the river with all possible celerity, and follow the re treating enemy. The men entered upon the duty assigned them with the greatest zeal, crossed the river, and followed in the direction taken by the Indians. Captain Buerger took with him the remaining force of the Third Regiment and the field-piece, and proceeded up the river to a point where he sus pected the Indians would pass in their retreat, and where he was able to conceal his men from their sight until within a very short distance. On the 21st they passed the spot where a Mr. Andrew Austin had been murdered by the Indiam a short time previous. His body was found, terri ribly mutilated, the head having been severed from the body, and lying about forty rods distant from it, with the scalp torn off. It was buried by the expedition in the best style that circumstances would admit. Pomme de Terre river was reached He soon discovered, however, that the savages were retreating, under covets of the woods, across the prairie, in the direction of the Wild Rice river. The whole expedition was then ordered to cross the river, which was effected in less than an hour, the men not awaiting to be carried over in wagons, but plunging into the water, breast-deep, and wading to the opposite shore. in the evening. On the 22d they arrived at the Old Crossing, on the Otter Tail river, between Dayton and Breck enridge, about fifteen miles from the latter place. On the 23d the march was resumed, and nothing worthy of remark occurred until the expedition had approached within about a mile of the Red By this time the savages had retreated some three miles, and were about entering the heavy timber beyond the prairie, and further pursuit was considered useless. The march was continued to the fort, at which place the expedition arrived about 4 o'clock of the same day, to the great joy of the imprisoned garrison and citizens, who wel comed their deliverers with unbounded cheers and demonstrations of delight. River, and almost within sight of Fort Abercrom bie. At this point a dense smoke was observed in the direction of the fort, and the impression cre ated among the troops was, that the post had al ready fallen, and was now being reduced to ashes by the victorious savages, through the means of their favorite element of war. Upon ascending an eminence where a better view could be obtained, a much better state of af fairs was discovered to be existing. There stood the little fort, yet monarch of the prairie, and the flag of the Union was still waving above its bat tlements. The fire from which the smoke was arising was between the command and the post, and was occasioned by the burning of the prairie, which had been set on fire by the Indians, with the evident design of cutting off the expedition from the crossing of the river. After they had advanced a short distance further toward the river, a party of thirteen Indians appeared on the opposite bank, rushing in wild haste from a piece of woods. They hastily fired a few shots at our men from a distance of about fifteen hundred yards, inflicting no injuries on any one of the command, after which they disappeared in great trepidation, be hind some bushes on the river shore. When the moving columns of the expedition were first descried from the ramparts of the fort, they were taken to be Indians advancing to an other attack. All was excitement and alarm. The following description of the after-part of the scene is from the pen of a lady who was an inmate of the fort during the long weeks that they were besieged, and could not dare to venture beyond half cannon-shdt from the post without being in imminent peril of her life : \"About 5 o'clock the report came to quarters that the Indians were again coming from up to ward Bridges. With a telescope we soon discovered four white men, our messengers, riding at full speed, who, upon reaching here informed us that in one half hour we would be reinforced by three hundred and fifty men.

They were so dusty I did not know one of them.\" dieted such barbarities upon his lifeless form; neither could they have had aught against him, except his belonging to a different race, and his be ing found in a country over which they wished to re-establish their supremacy. ******:\u00a3* That his body had been treated with stdl greater indignity and cruelty than that of the soldier was in accordance with feelings previously expressed to some of the garrison. In conversation with some of the Sioux, previous to the commencement of hostilities, they declared a very strong hatred against the settlers in the country, as they fright ened away the game, and thus interfered with their hunting. They objected, in simdar terms, to having United States troops quartered so near them, but said they did not blame the soldiers, as they had to obey orders, and go wherever they were directed, but the settlers had encroached upon them, of their own free will, and as a matter of choice; for this reason the citizens should be se verely dealt with. On the same day that the expedition reached the fort, but at an early hour, it had been deter mined to dispatch a messenger to St. Paul, with re ports of the situation of the garrison, and a request for assistance. The messenger was escorted a con siderable distance by a force of twenty men, com posed of soldiers and partly of the citizens quar tered at the pest. When returning, and within about a mile of the fort, they were fired upon by Indians in ambush, and two of the number, one citizen and one soldier, were kdled, and fell into the hands of the enemy. The others, by extraor dinary exertions, succeeded in making their es cape, and returned to the garrison. The next morning, about two-thirds of the mounted company, under command of Captain Freeman, escorted by a strong infantry force, went out to search for the bodies of those slain on the day before. After scouring the woods for a con siderable distance, the bodies were found upon the prairie, some sixty or eighty rods apart, mangled and mutilated to such a degree as to be almost de prived of human form. The body of the citizen was found ripped open from the center of the ab domen to the throat. The heart and dver were en tirely removed, while the lungs were torn out and left upon the outside of the chest. The head was cut off, scalped, and thrust within the cavity of the abdomen, with the face toward the feet. The hands were cut off and laid side by side, with the palms downward, a short distance from the main portion of the body. The body of the soldier had been pierced by two balls, one of which must have oc casioned almost instant death. When found, it was lying upon the face, with the upper part of the head completely smashed and beaten in with clubs whde the brains were scattered around upon the grass. It exhibited eighteen bayonet wounds in the back, and one of the legs had received a gash almost, or quite, to the bone, extending from the cad to the junction with the body. No more Indians were seen around the fort until the 26th of September. At about 7 o'clock of that day, as Captain Freeman's company were water ing their horses at the river, a volley was fired upon them by a party of Sioux, who had placed themselves in ambush for the purpose. One man, who had gone as teamster with the expedition, was mortally wounded, so that he died the suc ceeding night; the others were unarmed. From behind the log-buildings and breastworks the fire was soon returned with considerable effect, as a number of the enemy were seen to fall and be car ried off by their comrades. At one time two In dians were observed skulking near the river. They were fired upon by three men from the fortifica tion, and both fell, when they were dragged away by their companions. On another occasion, during the fight, one of the enemy was discovered perched on a tree, where he had stationed himself, either for the purpose of obtaining a view of the movements inside of the fort, or to gain a more favorable position for firing upon our men. He was fired upon by a member of Captain Barret's company, when he released his hold upon the tree and fell heavdy into a fork near the ground, from which he was removed and borne off by his comrades. In a very short time a howitzer was brought into position, and a few shells (which the Indians designate as rotten bul lets) were thrown among them, silencing their fire and causing them to withdraw. The citizen had dved in the vicinity for years. The Indians had been in the habit of visiting his father's house, sharing the hospitalities of the dwelling, and receiving alms of the family. He must have been wed known to the savages who in- 1(3"], [256, "niSTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 242 A detachment, comprising Captain Freeman's company, fifty men of the 3d Regiment, and a squad in charge of a howitzer, were ordered in pursuit, and started over the prairie, up the river. At the distance of about two miles they came upon the Sioux camp, but the warriors fled in the great est haste and consternation upon their approach. A few shots were fired at them in their flight, to which they replied by yells, but were in too great haste to return the fire. The howitzer was again opened upon them, whereupon their yelling sud denly ceased, and they rushed, if possible, with stid greater celerity through the brush and across the river. Minnesota river and the Iowa line, supposed in the early part of the military movement to occupy a position of extreme danger, was placed under the control of Hon. Charles E. Flandrau. In the division was the Winnebago Reservation. And it was reasonably supposed that the Winnebagoes would more readily unite with the Sioux than with the Ojibwas [Chippewas] in the northern part of the State, the former tribe being on good terms with the Sioux, while the latter held the Sioux as hereditary enemies, with whom an alliance offen sive or defensive would hardly take place, unless under extraordinary conditions, such as a general war of the Indian tribes upon the white race. This peculiar condition did not mark the present out break. Their camp was taken possession of, and was found to contain a considerable quantity of plun der, composed of a variety of articles, a stock of liquors being part of the assortment. Everything of value was carried to the fort, and the remainder was burned upon the ground. In this portion of the State were distributed the following forces, subject to special duty as circum stances required: a company of sixty-three mem bers under the command of Captain Cornelius F. Buck, marched from Winona, Sept.l, 1861; on the 26th of August, six days previous, Captain A. J. Edgerton, of the 10th Regiment, with one hun dred and nine men, arrived at the Winnebago Agency, where the inhabitants were in great ter ror. After the evacuation of New Ulm, by Col onel Flandrau, he encamped at Crisp's farm, half way between New Ulm and Mankato. On the 31st of August, a company of forty -four members, from Mankato, took up position at South Bend, at which place Colonel Flandrau had established his headquarters. On the 23d of August a company of fifty-eight members, from Winnebago City, under command of Captain H. W. Holly, was raised for special services in the counties of Blue Earth, Faribault, Martin, Watonwan, and Jackson. This command, on the 7th of September, was re lieved at Winnebago City by the Fillmore County Rangers, under the command of Captain Colburn. At Blue Earth City, a company of forty-two mem bers, under command of Captain J. B. Wakefield, by order of Colonel Flandrau. remained at that point and erected fortifications, and adopted means for subsisting his men there during the term of their service. Major Charles R. Read, of the State militia, with a squad of men from south-eastern Minnesota, also reported to Colonel Flandrau at South Bend. Captain Dane, of the 9th Regi ment, was by order of the Colonel in command, stationed at New Ulm. Captain Post, and Colonel John R.

Fire was first opened upon them, which they returned, wounding one man. They were immediately routed and driven off, but with what loss, if any, was unknown. On the 30th of September Captain Freeman's company and the members of the 3d Regiment, together with a number of citizens and families, started on their return from Fort Abercrombie to St. Cloud. They passed by where the town of Dayton had formerly stood, scarcely a vestige of which was then found remaining. The dead body of one of the citizens, who had been murdered, was there found, and buried in the best manner possible under the circumstances. The whole train arrived in safety at St. Cloud, on the 5th of October, without having experienced any consid erable adventures on the journey. CHAPTER XLI. SOUTH-WESTERN DEPARTMENT \u2014 HON.

Captain Ambler, of the 10th Regiment, reported his company, and was stationed at Mankato. Captain Sanders, of the 10th, also reported, and was stationed at Le Sueur. Captain Meagher likewise was assigned a position with his company at Mankato, where the company was raised. Captain Cleary, with a company, was stationed at Marysburg, near the Winnebago Reserve, and a similar company, under Captain Potter, was raised, and remained at camp near home. Captain E. St. Julien Cox, with a com mand composed of detachments from different companies, was stationed at Madelia. He here erected a fort commanding the country for some twenty miles. It was octagonal in form, two stories in height, with thirty feet between the walls. This was inclosed by a breastwork and ditch six feet deep, and four feet wide at the bottom, with projecting squares of simdar thickness on the cor ners, from which the ditch could be swept through its entire length. This structure was named Fort Cox, in honor of its projector. Minnesota, the first State in the North-west, bounded on the east by the Great Father of Wa ters, had taken her place in the fair sisterhood of states with prospects as flattering as any that ever entered the American Union. The tide of hardy, vigorous, intedigent emigrants had come hither from the older states, as wed as from England, Ireland, and the different countries on the Euro pean continent, until a thriving population of 200,000 had taken up their abode upon her virgin soil, and were in the quiet and peaceable enjoy ment of her salubrious climate. Her crystal lakes, her wooded streams, her bewitching water-falls, her island groves, her lovely prairies, would have added gems to an earthly paradise. Her Lake Superior, her Mississippi, her Red River of the North, and her Minnesota, were inviting adjuncts to the com merce of the world. Her abundant harvests and her fertile and enduring soil gave to the husband man the highest hopes of certain wealth. Her po sition in the track of the tidal human current sweeping across the continent to the Pacific coast, and thence around the globe, placed her forever on the highway of the nations. Minnesota, thus situated, thus lovely in her virgin youth, had one dark spot resting on the horizon of her otherwise cloudless sky. The dusky savage, as we have seen, dwelt in the land. And, when all was peace, without a note of warning, that one dark spot, moved by the winds of savage hate, suddenly obscured the whole sky, and poured out, to the bitter dregs, the vials of its wrath, without mixture of mercy. The blow fell like a storm of thunderbolts from the clear, bright heavens. The storm of fierce, savage murder, in its most horrid and frightful forms, rolled on. Day passed and night came; From this disposition of forces in the depart ment commanded by Colonel Flandrau, it wid be seen that the south-western portion of the State was provided with the most ample means of de fense against any attack from any open enemy in any ordinary warfare; and yet on the 10th of Sep tember, the wily Indian made an attack upon But ternut Valley, near the dne of Blue Earth and Brown counties and fired upon the whites, wound ed a Mr. Lewis in the hand, kided James Edwards, and stdl further on killed Thomas J. Davis, a Mr. Mohr, and wounded Mr. John W. Task and left him for dead. Mr. Task, however, survived. And again on the 21st of September, a party of Sioux came into Watonwan county, killed John Arm strong, two children of a Mr. Patterson, and a Mr. Peterson. \"Down sank the sun, nor ceased the carnage there \u2014 Tumultuous horrors rent the midnight air,\" until the sad catalogue reached the fearful number of two thousand human victims, from the gray haired sire to the helpless infant of a day, who lay mangled and dead on the ensanguined field 1 The dead were left to bury the dead; for The consequences of the massacre we have de tailed in these pages to some extent can be easdy imagined, and the task of the historian might here be transferred to the reader. But even the reader of fiction, much more the reader of history, re quires some aid to direct the imagination in arriv ing at proper conclusions. A few words in connec tion with the facts already presented wdl suffice to exhibit this tragic epoch in our State's history in \"The dead reigned there alone.\" In two days the whole work of murder was done, with here and there exceptional cases in differ ent settlements. And during these two days a popidation of thirty thousand, scattered over some eighteen counties, on the western border of the state, on foot, on horseback, with teams of oxen and horses, under the momentum of the panic thus its proper light."], [258, "244 HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. created, were rushing wddly and frantically over the prairies to places of safety, either to Fort Ridgely or to the yet remaining towns on the Min nesota and Mississippi rivers. Flight from an in vading army of civilized foes is awful; but flight from the upldted tomahawk, in the hands of sav age fiends in pursuit of unarmed men, women and chddren, is a scene too horrible for the stoutest heart. The unarmed men of the settlements offer ed no defense, and could offer none, but fled before the savage horde, each in his own way, to such places as the dictates of sed preservation gave the slightest hope of safety. Some sought the protec tion of the nearest slough ; others crawled into the tall grass, hiding, in many instances, in sight of the lurking foe. Children of tender years, hacked and beaten and bleeding, fled from their natural protectors, now dead or disabled, and, by the aid of some trad of blood, or by the instincts of our common nature, fled away from fields of slaughter, cautiously crawling by night from the line of fire and smoke in the rear, either toward Fort Ridgely or to some distant town on the Minnesota or the Mississippi. Over the entire border of the State, and even near the populous towns on the river, an eye looking down from above could have seen a human avalanche of thirty thousand, of all ages, and in all possible plight, the rear ranks maimed and bleeding, and faiut from starvation and the loss of blood, continually falling into the hands of inhuman savages, keen and fierce, on the trail of the white man. An eye thus situated, d human, could not endure a scene so terrible. And angels from the realms of peace, if ever touched with human woe, over such a scene might have shed tears of blood; and, passing the empyreal sphere into the Eternal presence, we might see and ferocious. To appreciate this, one must see, as I have, the mutilated bodies of their victims. My heart is steeled against them, and if I have the means, and can catch them, I will sweep them with the besom of death.\" Again, aduding to the narrations of those who have escaped from the scenes of the brutal carnage, he says: \"Don't think there is an exaggeration in the horrible pictures given by individuals \u2014 they fall far short of the dreadful reality.\" The Adjutant-General of the state, in an official document, has attempted, by words of carefully measured meaning, to draw a picture of the scenes we are feebly attempting to present on paper. But this picture is cold and stately com pared with the vivid coloring of living reality. \"During the time that this force was being mar shaled and engaged in the march to this point (St. Peter), the greater portion of the country above was being laid waste by murder, fire and robbery. The inhabitants that could make their escape were fleeing like affrighted deer before the advancing gleam of the tomahawk. Towns were deserted by the residents, and their places gladly taken by those who had fled from more sparsely settled portions of the regions. A stream of fugitives, far outnumbering the army that was marching to their relief, came pouring down the valley. The arrivals from more distant points communicated terror to the settlements, and the inhabitants there fled to points stdl further in the interior, to communicate in turn the alarm to others stid further removed from the scene of hos tdities. This rushing tide of humanity, on foot, on horse, and in all manner of vehicles, came meet ing the advancing columns of our army. Even this sign of protection failed to arrest their pro gress. On they came, spreading panic in their course, and many never halted tid they had reached the capital city of the state; while others again felt no security even here, and hurriedly and rashly sacrificed their property, and fled from the state of their adoption to seek an asylum of safety in some of our sister states further removed from the sound of the war-whoop.\" * * * * * \"God lament, And draw a cloud of mourning round his throne.\" Who wid say, looking on this picture, that the human imagination can color it at ad equal to the sad reality ? Reality here has outdone the highest flights to which fancy ever goes! The sober minded Governor Sibley, not unused to the most horrible phases of savage hfe, seeing only a tithe of the wide field ot ruin, giving utterance to his thoughts in official form, says: \"Unless some crushing blow can be dealt at once upon these too successful murderers, the state is ruined, and some of its fairest portions wid revert, for years, into the possession of these miserable wretches, who, of all devils in human shape, are among the most cruel Thirty thousand panic-stricken inhabitants at once desert their homes in the midst of an indis criminate slaughter of men, women and children.

The varied emotions that straggled for utterance in that frag mentary mass of humanity cannot be even faintly set forth in words. The imagination, faint and aghast, turns from the picture in dismay and hor ror! What indedble images are burned in upon the tablets of the souls of thousands of mothers bereft of their children by savage barbarity! What unavailing tears fall unseen to the ground from the scattered army of almost helpless in fancy, now reduced by cruel hands to a life of cheerless orphanage! How many yet linger around the homes they loved, hiding from the keen-eyed savage, awaiting the return of father, mother, brother, or friend, who can never come again to their relief! We leave the reader to his own contemplations, standing in view of this mournful picture, the narration of which the heart sickens to pursue, and turns away with more be coming silence! \u00bb town of New Ulm was on fire, and its inhabitants were being massacred by the savages, led by Lit tle Crow. At the same time, or a little previous, came the tidings that Fort Ridgely was in immi nent danger; that Captain Marsh had been kdled, and his command almost, d not entirely, cut off, in attempting to give succor to the Lower Agency, which had been attacked on the morning of the 18th, the day previous, and was then in ashes. By nine o'clock the news of these events began to meet a response from the surrounding country. Horsemen and footmen, from different parts of Nicollet and Le Sueur counties, came hurrying into town, some with guns and ammunition, but more without arms. Men were hurrying through the streets in search of guns and ammunition; some were running budets, whde others were fit ting up teams, horses, and provisions. Busiest among the agitated mass were Hon. Charles E. Flandrau and Captain William B. Dodd, giving directions for a hasty organization for the purpose of defending New Ulm, or, if that was impossible, to hold the savages in check, outside of St. Peter, sufficiently long to give the men, women, and chddren some chance to save their lives by hasty flight, if necessary. Every man, woman, and child seemed to catch the spirit of the alarming moment. Now, at about ten o'clock, Judge Flan drau, as captain, with quick words of command, aided by proper subalterns in rank, with one hun dred and thirty-five men, armed as best they could be, with shot-guns, muskets, rifles, swords, and re volvers, took up the line of march for New Ulm. At an earlier hour, fifty volunteers, known as the Renville Rangers, on their way to Fort Sneldng, had turned their course toward Fort Ridgely, taking with them ad the Government arms at St. Peter. The scene of the panic extended to other coun ties and portions of the State remote from all ac tual danger. The Territory of Dakota was de populated, except in a few towns on the western border. Eastward from the Minnesota river to the Mississippi, the inhabitants fled from their homes to the towns of Red Wing, Hastings, Wabasha, and Winona; and thousands again from these places to Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and some to distant New England friends. Thirty thousand human beings, suddenly forced from their homes, destitute of all the necessaries of hfe, coming suddenly upon the towns in the Minnesota Vadey, can easily be supposed to have been a burden of onerous and crushing weight. It came like an Alpine avalanche, sweeping down, in the wddness of its fury, upon the plain. No \u25a0wisdom could direct it; no force could resist it. No power of description is equal to the task of presenting it in fitting words. It was horribly \"grand, gloomy, and peculiar.\" One faint picture must here suffice. With the departure of these noble bands went not only the wishes and prayers of wives, mothers, brothers, sisters, and chddren for success, but with them ad, or nearly ad, the able-bodied citizens capable of bearing arms, together with ad the guns and ammunition St. Peter could muster. For one moment we follow these little bands of soldiers, the hope of the Minnesota Valley. Their march is rapid. To one of these parties thirty weary miles intervened between them and the burning town of New Ulm. Expecting to meet the savage foe on their route, flushed with their successful massacre at New Ulm, the skirmishers \u2014 a few men on horseback \u2014 were kept in advance of the hurry - St. Peter, on the morning of the 19th of August, 1862, mandested some unwonted commotion. Couriers arrived before the dawn of that day, an nouncing the alarming news that the neighboring"], [260, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 246 big footmen. Before dark, the entire force des tined for New Ulm reached the crossing of the Minnesota at the Red Stone Ferry. Here, for a moment, a halt was ordered; the field of ruin lay in fud view before them. The smoke of the burn ing buildings was seen ascending over the town. No signs of hfe were visible. Some might yet be alive. There was no wavering in that little army of relief. The ferry was manned, the river was crossed, and soon New Ulm was frantic with the mingled shouts of the delivered and their deliv erers. An account of the hard- fought battle which terminated the siege is to be found in another chapter of this work. Such expedition has seldom, if ever, been chronicled, as was exhib ited by the deliverers of New Ulm. Thirty miles had been made in a little over half a day, travel ing ad the time in the face of a motley crowd of panic-stricken refugees, pouring in through every avenue toward St. Peter. savages, the bodies of the recently-murdered, the burning of houses, the admitted danger of a sudden attack upon St. Peter, agitated and moved that vast multitude as if some volcano was ready to engulf them. The overflowing streets were crowded into the already overflowing houses. The stone buildings were barricaded, and the women and children were huddled into every conceivable place of safety. Between hope and fear, and prayer for succor, several weary days and nights passed away, when, on the 22d day of August, the force under Colonel Sibley, fourteen hundred strong, arrived at St. Peter. Now, as the dread of immediate massacre was past, they were siezed with a fear of a character en tirely different. How shad this multitude be fed, clothed and nursed? The grain was unthreshed in the field, and the flour in the only mill left standing on the Minnesota, above Bede Plaine, was almost gone. The flouring-mid at Mankato, twelve miles above, in the midst of the panic, had been burned, and fears were entertained that the mill at St. Peter would share the same fate. Nor had this multitude any means within themselves to support life a single day. Every scheme known to human ingenuity was canvassed. Every device was suggested, and every expedient tried. The multitude was fearfully clamoring for food, rai ment, and shelter. The sick and wounded were in need of medicine and skillful attention. Between six and seven thousand persons, besides the citi zens of the place, were already crowding the town; and some thousand or fifteen hundred more dady expected, as a proper quota from the two thousand now compeded to abandon New Ulm. The gath ering troops, regular and irregular, were moving, in large numbers, upon St. Peter, now a frontier town of the State, bordering on the country under the full dominion of the Annuity Sioux Indians, with torch and tomahawk, burning and murdering in their train. The other party, by dusk, had reached Fort Ridgely, traveling about forty-five miles, crossing the ravine near the fort at the precise point where one hundred and fifty Indians had lain in ambush awaiting their approach until a few moments be fore they came up, and had only retired for the night; and, when too late to intercept them, the disappointed savages saw the Renvdle Rangers enter the fort. But let us now return to St. Peter. What a night and a day have brought forth! The quiet vidage of a thousand inhabitants thus increased by thousands, had become full to overflowing. Every private house, every pubdc house, every church, school-house, warehouse, shed, or saloon, and every vacant structure is full. The crowd throng the public highways; a line of cooking stoves smoke along the streets; the vacant lots are occupied, for there is no room in the houses. All is clatter, rattle, and din. Wagons, ponies, mules, oxen, cows and calves are promiscuously distrib uted among groups of men, women and children. The live stock from thousands of deserted farms surround the outskirts of the town; the lowing of strange cattle, the neighing of restless horses, the crying of lost and hungry children, the tales of horror, the tomahawk wounds undressed, the bleeding feet, the cries for food, and the loud wading for missing friends, all combine to bum into the soul the dreadful reality that some ter rible calamity was upon the country. A committee, aided by expert clerks, opened an office for the distribution of such articles of food, clothing and medical stores as the town could furnish, on their orders, trusting to the State or General Government for pay at some fu ture day. So great was the crowd pressing for relief, that much of the exhausting labor was per formed while bayonets guarded the entrance to the building in which the office of distribution was held. A bakery was estabdshed, furnishing two thousand loaves of bread per day, while many pri- But the news of the rapid approach of the"], [261, "REFUGEES AT ST. PETER. 247 vate houses were put under requisition for the same purpose, and, aided by individual benevo lence throughout the town, the hungry began to be scantily fed. A butcher-shop was pressed into the needed service, capable of supplying ten thou sand rations a day over and above the citizens' ordinary demand. Stid, there was a vast moving class, single persons, women, and children, not yet reached by these wed-directed efforts. The com mittee, feeling every impulse of the citizens, to satisfy the demand for food fitted up a capacious soup-house, where as high as twelve hundred meals were supplied daily. This institution was a great success, and met the entire approval of the citizens, whde it suited the conditions of the pe culiar population better than any other mode in which relief could be administered. Soup was al ways ready; and its quality was superior. The aged and the young could here find relief, singly or in families; the wed relished it, and the sick found it a grateful beverage. In this way the committee, aided by the extreme efforts of private charity, ever active and -vigilant, continued for weeks to feed the refugees at St. Peter, taxing every energy of body and mind from twelve to sixteen hours per day. The census of the population was never taken; but it is believed that, after the arri val of the refugees from New Ulm, and a portion of the inhabitants from Le Sueur county, east of the town, excluding the fourteen hundred troops under Colonel H. H. Sibley, who were here a part of the time, the population of St. Peter was at least nine thousand. This was an estimate made by the committee of supplies, who issued eight thousand rations of beef each day to refugees alone, estimating one ration to a person. The ra tion was from a half-pound to a pound, varied to meet the condition of persons and families. the necessary demands of the gathering cavalry. Some military power seemed needed to regulate the collection and distribution of food in this de partment. This soon came in an official order from Col. H. H. Sibley to a member of the com mittee, assigning him to the separate duty of col lecting food for Government use at St. Peter. A wider range of country was now brought under contribution, and such of the live stock as was re quired for constant use was amply supplied. The cattle not required by the butchers were forced to a stid wider extent of country. Not only food, such as the mill, the bakery, the butcher-shop, and the soup-house could furnish was required among this heterogeneous multitude, but the infirm, the aged and the sick needed other articles, which the merchant and druggist alone could furnish. Tea, coffee, sugar, salt, soap, can dles, wine, brandy, and apothecaries' drugs, as well as shoes, boots, hats, and wear for men, women and chddren, and articles of bedding and hospital stores, were demanded as being abso lutely necessary. The merchants and druggists of the town honored the orders of the committee, and this demand was partiady supplied. In ad these efforts of the town to meet the wants of the refugees, it was discovered that the limit of sup ply would soon be reached. But the demand still continued inexorable. The fearful crisis was ap proaching! Pubdc exertion had found its dmit; private benevolence was exhausted; the requisite stores of the merchant and the druggist were wed nigh expended. It was not yet safe to send the multitude to their homes in the country. The fierce savage was yet in the land, thirsting for blood. What shall be done? Shall this vast crowd be sent to other towns, to St. Paul, or stid further, to other states, to seek relief from public charity ? or shad they be suffered to perish here, when all means of relief shall have faded ? But the task of feeding the living did not stop with the human element. The live stock, horses and oxen, with an innumerable herd of cattle from a thousand prairies, ruly and unruly, furious from fright, so determined on food that in a few days not a green spot could be protected from their vo racious demands. Fences offered no obstruction. Some bold leader laid waste the field or garden, and total destruction followed, until St. Peter was as barren of herbage, with scarce an exception, as the Great American desert. The committee could not meet successfully this new demand. The sixty tons of hay cut by their order was only an aggravation to the teams of the Government and On the 13th of September, 1862, after a month had nearly expired, a relief committee, consisting of Rev. A. H. Kerr and F. Lange, issued an ap peal, approved by M. B. Stone, Provost Marshal of St. Peter, from which we make a few extracts, showing the condition of things at the time it bears date. Previous to this, however, a vast number had left for other places, principally for St. Paul, crowding the steamboats on the Minnesota river to their utmost capacity. The appeal says: \"Friends! Brethren!

A terrible blow has fallen upon this frontier, by the uprising of the Sioux or Dakota Indians.

Other places on the frontier, such as Henderson, Chaska, Carver, and even Bede Plaine, Shakopee, and St. Paul, felt, more or less, the crushing weight of the army of refugees, as they poured across the country and down the Minnesota Val ley; but no place felt this burden so heavily as the frontier town of St. Peter. One reflection should here be made. Had New Ulm and Fort Ridgely fallen on the first attack, Mankato and St. Peter would have been taken be fore the state troops could have offered the proper assistance. Had New Ulm faden on the 19th, when it was attacked, and Fort Ridgely on the 20th, when the attack was made on that place, Mankato and St. Peter could easily have been reached by the 21st, when the state troops were below, on their way to St. Peter. The successful defense of these places, New Ulm and Fort Ridge ly, was accomplished by the volunteer citizens of Nicollet, Le Sueur, and Blue Earth counties, who reached New Ulm by the 19th of August, and the Renville Rangers, who timely succored Fort Ridge ly, by a forced march of forty-five miles in one day, reaching the fort previous to the attack on that post. Whatever credit is due to the state troops, for the successful defense of the frontier and the rescue of the white captives, should be gratefully acknowledged by the citizens of Min nesota. Such acts are worthy of lasting honor to all who were participants in those glorious deeds. But to the brave men who first advanced to the defense of New Ulm and Fort Ridgely, higher honor and a more lasting debt of gratitude are due from the inhabitants of the valley of the Min nesota. Let their names be honored among men. Let them stand side by side with the heroes of other days. Let them rank with veteran brethren who, on Southern battle-fields, have fought nobly for constitutional freedom and the perpetuity of the Union of these states. These are ad of them worthy men, who like \"In some cases the whole famdy have been mur dered; in others the husband has fallen; in others the wife and children have been taken captive; in others only one child has escaped to tell the sad story. Stealthily the Indians came upon the set tlements, or overtook famibes flying for refuge. Unprotected, alarm and terror siezed the people, and to escape with life was the great struggle. Mothers clasped their little ones in their arms and fled; if any lagged behind they were overtaken by a shot or the hatchet. Many, many thus left their homes, taking neither food nor clothing with them. The Indians immediately commenced the work of pillaging, taking clothing and bedding, and, in many instances giving the house and all it con tained to the flames. Some have lost their all, and many, from comparative comfort, are left ut terly destitute.

CHAPTER XLTI. BATTLE OF BIRCH COOLIE BATTLE OF WOOD LAKE This battle, in ad probabdity, saved the towna of Mankato and St. Peter from the destruction in tended by the savages. They had left Yedow Medicine with the avowed object of attacking these towns on the Minnesota. The signal defeat of the forces of Little Crow at Birch Coode, not only saved the towns of Mankato and St. Peter, but in effect ended his efforts in subduing the whites on the borders. CAMP RELEASE MILITARY COMPANIES SUC CESS OF THE EXPEDITION UNDER GENERAL SIBLEY. The massacre being the main design of this his tory, the movement of the troops, in the pursuit and punishment of the Indians connected with the atrocious murders initiated on the 18th of August, 1862, must especiady, in this abridgement, be ex ceedingly brief. On the day after the outbreak, August 19th, 1862, an order was issued by the commander-invchief to Colonel H. H. Sibley, to proceed, with four com- panies, then at Fort Snelling, and such other forces as might join his command, to the protec- tion of the frontier counties of the State. The entire force, increased by the separate commands of Colonels Marshad and McPhail, reached Fort Ridgely, August 28th, 1862. A detachment made up of Company A, 6th Regiment Minnesota Volunteers, under Captain H. P. Grant, some sev- enty mounted men under Captain Joseph Ander- son, and a fatigue party, aggregating in ad a force of over one hundred and fifty men, were sent in advance of the main army, to protect the set- tlements from further devastation, and at the same time collect and bury the dead yet lying on the field of the recent slaughter. On the first of Sep- tember, near the Beaver Creek, Captain Grant's party found Justina Krieger, who had escaped alive from the murders committed near Sacred Heart. Mrs Krieger had been shot and dread- fully butchered. During this day this detachment buried fifty-five victims of savage barbarity, and in the evening went into camp at Birch Coolie. The usual precautions were taken, and no imme- diate fears of Indians were apprehended; yet at half-past four o'clock on the morning of the sec- ond of September, one of the guards shouted \"Indians!\" Instantly thereafter a shower of bul- lets was poured into the encampment. A most fearful and terrible battle ensued, and for the num- bers engaged, the most bloody of any in which our forces had been engaged during the war. The loss of men, in proportion to those engaged, was extremely large; twenty-three were kided out- right, or mortady wounded, and forty-five so se- verely wounded as to require surgical aid, whde scarce a man remained whose dress had not been pierced by the enemies' bullets. On the evening of the 3d of September the besieged camp was After the battle of Birch Coode ad the maraud ing forces under the direction of Little Crow were called in, and a retreat was ordered up the valley of the Minnesota toward Yellow Medicine; and on the 16th day of September Colonel Sibley ordered an advance of his whole column in pursuit of the fleeing foe; his forces now increased by the 3d Minnesota Volunteers, paroled prisoners returned from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, under command of Major Abraham E. Welch. On the evening of the 22d Colonel Sibley ar rived at Wood Lake. On the morning of the 23d, at about seven o'clock, a force of three hundred Indians suddenly appeared before his camp, yell ing as savages only can yell, and firing with great rapidity. The troops under Colonel Sibley were cool and determined, and the 3d Regiment needed no urging by officers. Ad our forces engaged the enemy with a will that betokened quick work with savages who had outraged every sentiment of hu manity, and earned for themselves an immortality of infamy never before achieved by the Dakota nation. The fight lasted about two hours. We lost in killed four, and about fifty wounded. The enemy's loss was much larger; fourteen of their dead were left on the field, and an unknown number were carried off the field, as the Indians are accustomed to do. The battle of Wood Lake put an end to all the hopes of the renowned chief. His warriors were in open rebedion against his schemes of warfare against the whites. He had gained nothing. Fort Ridgely was not taken. New Ulm was not in his possession. St. Peter and Mankato were intact, and at Birch Coolie and Wood Lake he had suffered defeat. No warrior would longer fodow his fortunes in a war so disastrous. On the same day of the battle at Wood Lake a deputation from the Wapeton band appeared under a flag of truce, asking terms of peace. The response of Colonel Sibley was a demand for the delivery of ad the"], [264, "250 HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. white captives in the possession of these savages. Wabasha, at the head of fifty lodges, immediately parted company with Little Crow, and established a camp near Lac qui Parle, with a view of sur rendering his men on the most favorable terms. A flag of truce announced his action to Colonel Sibley, who soon after, under proper military guard, visited Wabasha's camp. After the formal ities of the occasion were over, Colonel Sibley re ceived the captives, in all, then and thereafter, to the number of 107 pure whites, and about 162 had-breeds, and conducted them to his headquar ters. The different emotions of these captives at their release can easily be imagined by the reader. This place well deserved the name given it, \"Camp Release.\" the commission of Brigadier General of Volun teers from the United States. The scouting party under Lieutenant-Colonel Marshad followed up the line of retreat of the fugi- tives, and near the edge of the Coteau de Prairie, about forty-five miles from Camp Release, found two lodges of straggling Indians. The males of these camps, three young men, were made prison- ers, and the women and children and an old man were directed to deliver themselves up at Camp Release. From these Indians here captnred they received information of twenty-seven lodges en- camped near Chanopa (Two Wood) lakes. At these lakes they found no Indians; they had left, but the trad was followed to the north-west, to- wards the Big Sioux river. At noon of the 16th, Lieutenant-Colonel Marshall took with him fifty mounted men and the howitzer and started in pur- suit, without tents or supplies of any kind, but leaving the infantry and supply wagons to follow after. They crossed the Big Sioux river, passing near and on the north side of Lake Kampeska. By fodowing closely the Indian trail, they ar- rived at dark at the east end of a lake some six or eight mdes long, and about eight miles in a north- westwardly direction from Lake Kampeska. Here they halted, without tents, fire or food, until near daylight, when reconnoitering commenced, and at an early hour in the morning they succeeded in surprising and capturing a camp composed of ten lodges, and thirteen Indians and their famdies. From those captured at this place information was received of another camp of some twelve or fifteen lodges, located at the distance of about one day's march in the direction of James river. A Military Commission was soon after inau gurated to try the parties charged with the mur der of white persons. The labors of this commis sion continued untd about the 5th of November, 1862. Three hundred and twenty-one of the sav ages and their allies had been found guilty of the charges preferred against them; three hundred and three of whom were recommended for cajdtal punishment, the others to suffer imprisonment. These were immediately removed, nnder a guard of 1,500 men, to South Bend, on the Minnesota river, to await further orders from the United States Government. Pursuit of th_5 Deserters. \u2014 After the disaster met with at Wood Lake, Little Crow, retreated, with those who remained with him, in the direc- tion of Big Stone Lake, some sixty miles to the westward. On the 5th of October, Colonel Sibley had sent a messenger to the princirjal camp of the deserters, to inform them that he expected to be able to pursue and overtake ad who remained in arms against the Government; and that the only ho]3e of mercy that they need expect, even for their wives and children, would be their early re- turn and surrender at discretion. By the 8th of October the prisoners who had come in and sur- rendered amounted to upwards of 2,000. On the 14th of October, Lieutenant Colonel Marshad, with 252 men, was ordered to go out upon the fron- tier as a scouting party, to ascertain whether there were any hostile camps of savages located within probable striking distance, from which they mio-ht be able, by sudden marches, to fall upon the set- tlements before the opening of the campaign in the coming spring. About this time, Colonel Sib ley, hitherto acting under State authority, received Placing a guard over the captured camp, the re- maining portion of the force pressed on in the di- rection indicated, and at the distance of about ten miles from the first camp, and about midway be- tween the Big Sioux and James rivers they came in sight of the second party, just as they were moving out of camp. The Indians attempted to make their escape by flight, but after an exciting chase for some distance they were overtaken and captured, without any armed resistance. Twenty- one men were taken at this place. Some of them had separated from the camp previous to the cap- ture, and were engaged in hunting at the time. On the return march, which was shortly after com- menced, six of these fodowed the detachment, and, after making ineffectual edorts to recover their famides, came forward and surrendered themselves"], [265, "INDIAN SYaMPATHISERS. 251 itants of the State, these orders were counter manded. They were directed to remain in the state, and the 3d Regiment was ordered off instead. into our hands The infantry and wagons were met by the returning party about ten miles west of the Big Sioux. The men of this detachment, officers and pri vates, evinced to a large degree the bravery and endurance that characterizes the true soldier. They wddngly and cheerfully pressed on after the savages, a part of them without food, fire or shel ter, and ad of them knowing that they were thereby prolonging the period of their absence beyond the estimated time, and subjecting them selves to the certain necessity of being at least one or two days without rations of any kind before the return to Camp Release could be effected. All the forces then remaining in the state were assigned to winter quarters at such points as it was thought expedient to keep guarded during the winter, and on the 25th of November Major-Gen eral Pope removed his headquarters to Madison, in the State of Wisconsin. Brigadier-General Sib ley then remained in the immediate command of the troops retained in service against the Indians, and established his headquarters in the city of St. Paul. On the 9th of October the \"Mankato Record\" thus speaks of this expedition: On the 7th of November, Lieutenant-Colonel Marshall, with a guard of some fifteen hundred men, started for Fort Sneding in charge of other captured Indians, comprising the women and chddren, and such of the men as were not found guilty of any henious crime by the Military Com mission, and arrived safely at their destination on the 13th. \"Considering the many serious disadvantages under which General Sibley has labored \u2014 a defi ciency of arms and ammunition, scarcity of pro visions, and the total absence of cavalry at a time when he could have successfully pursued and cap. tured Little Crow and his followers \u2014 the expedi tion has been successful beyond the most sanguine anticipations. Of the three hundred white cap tives in the hands of the Indians at the commence ment of the war, all, or nearly all, have been retaken and returned to their friends. Much pri vate property has been secured, and some fifteen hundred Indians, engaged directly or indirectly in the massacres, have been captured; and those who have actually stained their hands in the blood of our frontier settlers are condemned to suffer death. From the commencement of hostilities until the 16th day of September the war was carried on almost entirely from the resources of the State alone, and some little assistance from our sister States in the way of arms and ammunition. On this latter date Major-General John Pope, who had been appointed by the President of the United States to take command of the Department of the North-west, arrived and established his headquar ters in the city of St. Paul, in this state. The principal part of the active service of the season's campaign had previously been gone through with; but the forces previously under the command of of the State authorities were immediately turned over to his command, and the after-movements were entirely under his control and direction. Their sentence will be carried into execution, un less countermanded by authorities at Washington.\" CHAPTER XLIII.

Senator M. S. Wilkinson'and Congressmen C. Al- dried and Wdliam Windom, made an urgent ap peal to the President for the proper execution of the sentence in the case of these Indians. From this appeal the following extract wid be sufficient to indicate its character : But two hundred years never fads to change somewhat the character and sentiments of a great people, and blot from its memory something of its accredited history. This may have happened in the case of our fellow-kinsmen in the Eastern and Middle States. They may not now fully enter into the views and sentiments of those who witness ed the outrages of Phdip and his cruel warriors in their conspiracies against the infant colonies; in their attacks upon Springfield, Hatfield, Lan caster, Medfield, Seekong, Groton, Warwick, Marl borough, Plymouth, Taunton, Scituate, Bridge water, and Northfield. They seem not fully now to appreciate the atrocities of the savages of these olden times. The historian of the times of Phdip was not so sentimental as some of later days. \"The people of Minnesota, Mr. President, have stood firmly by you and your Administration. They have given both you and it their cordial support. They have not violated any law. They have bome these sufferings with patience, such as few people have ever exhibited under extreme trials. These Indians now are at their mercy; but our people have not risen to slaughter, because they believed their President would deal with them justly. \"We are told, Mr. President, that the committee from Pennsylvania, whose families are living hap pily in their pleasant homes in that state, have caded upon you to pardon these Indians. We protest against the pardon of these Indians; be cause if it is done, the Indians wid become more insolent and cruel than they ever were before, be lieving, as they certainly will, that their Great Father at Washington either justifies their acts or is afraid to punish them for their crimes. \" The town of Springfield received great injury from their attacks, more than thirty houses being burned; among the rest one containing a 'brave library,' the finest in that part of the country, which belonged to the Rev. Pelatiah Glover.\" \"This,\" says Hubbard, \"did, more than any other, discover the said actors to be the children of the devil, full of all subsidy and malice.\" And we of the present can not perceive why the massacre of innocent women and chddren should not as readily discover these Minnesota savages, under Little Crow, to be children of the devd as the burning of a minister's library two hundred years ago. Minnesotians lost by these Indians splen did, not to say brave dbraries; but of this minor evd they did not complain, in their demand for the execution of the condemned murderers. \"We protest against it, because, if the President does not permit the execution to take place under the forms of law, the outraged people of Minne sota will dispose of these wretches without law. These two people cannot live together. We do not wish to see mob law inaugurated in Minne sota, as it certainly wid be, if you force the peo ple to it. We tremble at the approach of such a condition of things in our state. \"You can give us peace, or you can give us law less violence. We pray you, as in view of all we have suffered, and of the danger which stdl awaits us, let the law be executed. Let justice be done to our people.\" Indians are the same in ad times. Two hun dred years have wrought no change upon Indian character. Had King Philip been powerful enough, he would have killed all the white men inhabiting the New England Colonies. \"Once an Indian, always an Indian,\" is fully borne out by their history during two hundred years' contact with the white race. The press of Minnesota, without a single excep tion, insisted that the condemned Indians should expiate their dreadful crime upon the gallows, whde the Eastern press, with some few exceptions, gave vent to the deeu sympathy of the sentimen tal phdosophers and the fanedul strains of the im- Eastern writers of the early history of the coun-"], [267, "MEMORIALS TO THE PRESIDENT. 253 try spoke and felt in regard to Indians very much as Minnesotians now speak and feel. When Weet amore, queen of Pocasset, and widow of Alexan der, Philip's eldest brother, in attempting to es cape from the pursuit of Captain Church, had lost her life, her head was cut off by those who discov ered her, and fixed upon a pole at Taunton ! Here, being discovered by some of her loving subjects, then in captivity, their unrestrained grief at the shocking sight is characterized by Mather as \"a most horrid and diabolical lamentation!\" Have Minnesotians exhibited a more unfeeling senti ment than this, even against condemned murder ers ? Mather lived, it is true, amid scenes of In dian barbarity. Had he lived in the present day and witnessed these revolting cruelties, he would have said with Colonel H. H. Sibley, \"My heart is steeled against them.\" But those who witness ed the late massacre could truly say, in the lan guage of an Eastern poet, the murder of their best friends, the whole body of the Annuity Sioux commenced a deliberate scheme to exterminate every white person upon the land once occupied by them, and by them long since sold to the United States. In carrying out this bloody scheme they have spared neither age nor sex, only reserving, for the gratification of their brutal lust, the few white women whom the rifle, the tomahawk and the scalping-knife spared. Nor did their fiendish barbarities cease with death, as the mutilated corpses of their victims, disemboweled, cut limb from limb, or chopped into fragments, wdl testify. These cruelties, too, were in many cases preceded by a pretense of friendship; and in many instances the victims of these more than murderers were shot down in cold blood as soon as their backs were turned, after a cordial shaking of the hand and loud professions of friendship on the part of the murderers. \"We ask that the same judgment should be passed and executed upon these deliberate mur derers, these ravishers, these mutdators of their murdered victims, that would be passed upon white men guilty of the same offense. The blood of hundreds of our murdered and mangled fellow citizens cries from the ground for vengeance. 'Vengeance is mine; I wid repay, saith the Lord;' and the authorities of the United States are, we believe, the chosen instruments to execute that vengeance. Let them not neglect their plain duty. \" All died\u2014 the wailing babe\u2014 the shrieking maid\u2014 And in the flood of tire that scathed the glade, The roofs went down !\" Early in December, 1862, whde the final decis ion of the President was delayed, the valley towns of Minnesota, led off by the city of St. Paul, held primary meetings, addressed by the most intelli gent speakers of the different localities. An ex tract from a memorial of one of the assemblages of the people is given as a sample of others of similar import. The extract quoted is from the St. Paul meeting, drawn up by George A. Nourse, United States District Attorney for the District of Minnesota: \"Nor do we ask alone for vengeance. We de mand security for the future. There can be no safety for us or for our families unless an example shall be made of those who have committed the horrible murders and barbarities we have recited. Let it be once understood that these Indians can commit such crimes, and be pardoned upon sur rendering themselves, and there is henceforth a torch for every white man's dwelling, a knife for every white man's heart upon our frontier. \"To the President of the United States: We, the citizens of St. Paul, in the State of Minnesota, respectfully represent that we have heard, with regret and alarm, through the public press, reports of an intention on the part of the United States Government to dismiss without punishment the Sioux warriors captured by our soldiers; and fur ther, to allow the several tribes of Indians lately located upon reservations within this State to re main upon the reservations. \"Nor wid even the most rigorous punishment give perfect security against these Indians so long as any of them are left among, or in the vicinity of, our border settlements. The Indian's nature can no more be trusted than the wolf's. Tame him, cultivate him, strive to Christianize him as vou will, and the sight of blood will in an instant cad out the savage, wolfish, devilish instincts of the race.

On Monday, the 21st, the thirty-nine had been removed to apartments separate and distinct from the other Indians, and the death-warrant was made known to them through an interpreter \u2014 the Rev. Mr. Riggs, one of the Sioux missionaries. Through the interpreter, Colonel Miller addressed the pris oners in substance, as follows: \"We respectfully ask, we demand that the cap tive Indians now in the hands of our military forces, proved before a military commission to be gudty of murder, and even worse crimes, shad re ceive the punishment due those crimes. This, too, not merely as a matter of vengeance, but much more as a matter of future security for our border settlers. \" The commanding officer at this place has caded to speak to you upon a very serious subject this afternoon. Your Great Father at Washington, after carefully reading what the witnesses have testified in your several trials, has come to the con clusion that you have each been guilty of wantonly and wickedly murdering his white children; and, for this reason, he has directed that you each be hanged by the neck until you are dead, on next Friday, and that order will be carried into effect on that day at ten o'clock in the forenoon. \"We ask, further, that these savages, proved to be treacherous, unreliable, and dangerous beyond example, may be removed from close proximity to our settlements, to such distance and such isola tion as shad make the people of this State safe from their future attacks.\" DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE PEOPLE IN MINNESOTA. The final decision of the President, on the 17th of December, 1862, ordering the execution of thir ty-nine of the three hundred condemned murderers, disappointed the people of Minnesota. These thirty-nine were to be hung on Friday, the 26th of December. \" Good ministers, both Catholic and Protestant, are here, from among whom each of you can se lect your spiritual adviser, who will be permitted to commune with you constantly during the few days that you are yet to live.\" It was not strange that the people of Minnesota were disappointed. How had New England looked upon her Indian captives in her early history ? Her history says : Adjutant Arnold was then instructed to read to them in English the letter of President Lincoln, which, in substance, stated the number and names of those condemned for execution, which letter was also read by Rev. S. R. Riggs, in Dakota. \" King Phdip was hunted like a wild beast, his body quartered and set on poles, his head exposed as a trophy for twinLy years on a gibbet, in Plymouth, and one of his hands sent to Boston; then the ministers returned thanks, and one said that they had prayed a bullet into Philip's heart. In 1677, on a Sunday, in Marblehead, the women, as they came out of the meeting-house, fell upon two Indians that had been brought in as captives. and, in a very tumultuous way, murdered them, in revenge for the death of some fishermen.\" The Colonel further instructed Mr. Riggs to ted them that they had so sinned against their fellow men that there is no hope of clemency except in the mercy of God through the merits of the Blessed Redeemer, and that he earnestly exhorted them to apply to Him as their only remaining source of consolation. The number condemned was forty, but one died before the day fixed for the execution, and one, Henry Milord, a half breed, had his sentence com muted to imprisonment for life in the penitentiary ; so that thirty-eight only were hung. These Puritan ideas have greatly relaxed in the descendants of the primitive stock. But, as the sepulchers of the fathers are garnished by their chddren as an indorsement of their deeds, shall we not hope that those who hai e in this way given evidence of their paternity will find some pallia tion for a people who have sinned in the similitude of their fathers? On the 16th of February, 1863, the treaties be fore that time existing between the United States and these annuity Indians were abrogated and an nulled, and all lands and rights of occupancy within the State of Minnesota, and all annuities and claims then existing in favor of said Indians were declared forfeited to the United States. On the 24th of December, at the request of the citizens of Mankato of a previous date, Colonel Miller, (Ex Governor Stephen Mider, whose death at Worthington, Minn., took place in August, 1881), in order to secure the public peace, declared These Indians, in the language of the act, had, in the year 1862, \"made unprovoked aggression and most savage war upon the United States, and"], [269, "REMOVAL OF INDIANS. 255 massacred a large number of men, women and children within the State of Minnesota;\" and as in this war and massacre they had \"destroyed and damaged a large amount of property, and thereby forfeited all just claims\" to their \"monies and an nuities to' the United States,\" the act provides that \"two-thirds of the balance remaining unexpended\" of their annuities for the fiscal year, not exceeding one hundred thousand dollars, and the further sum of one hundred thousand dollars, being two-thirds of the annuities becoming due, and payable during the next fiscal year, should be appropriated and paid over to three commissioners appointed by the President, to be by them apportioned among the heads of families, or their survivors, who uffered damage by the depreciations of said Indians, or the troops of the United States in the war against them, not exceeding the sum of two hundred dol lars to any one family, nor more than actual dam age sustained. All claims for damages were re quired, by the act, to be presented at certain times, and according to the rules prescribed by the commissioners, who should hold their first ses sion at St. Peter, in the State of Minnesota, on or before the first Monday of April, and make and return their finding, and all the papers re lating thereto, on or before the first Monday in December, 1863. On the 21st of February following the annuding of the treaty with the Sioux above named, Con gress passed \"An art for the removal of the Win nebago Indians, and 'the sale of their reservation in Minnesota for their benefit.\" The money aris ing from the sale of their lands, after paying their indebtedness, is, to be paid into the treasury of the United States, and expended, as the same is received, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in necessary improvements upon their new reservation. The lands in the new reservation are to be allotted in severally, not exceeding eighty acres to each head of a famdy, except to the chiefs, to whom larger allottments may be made, to be vested by patent in the Indian and his heirs, with out the right of alienation. These several acts of the General Government moderated to some extent the demand of the peo ple for the execution of the condemned Sioux yet in the military prison at Mankato. awaiting the final decision of the President. The removal of the Indians from the borders of Minnesota, and the opening up for settlement of over a million of acres of superior land, was a prospective ben efit to the State of immense value, both in its do mestic quiet and its rapid advancement in material wealth. \u2022 In pursuance of the acts of Congress, on the 22d of April, and for the purpose of carrying them into execution, the condemned Indians were first taken from the State, on board the steamboat Favorite, carried down the Mississippi, and con fined at Davenport, in the State of Iowa, where they remained, with only such privileges as are allowed to convicts in the penitentiary. The President appointed for this duty, and with the advice and consent of the Senate, the Hons. Albert S. White, of the State of Indiana, Eli R. Chase, of Wisconsin, and Cyrus Aldrich.of Minnesota. The duties of this board were so vigorously prosecuted, that, by the 1st of November fodowing their appointment, some twenty thousand sheets of legal cap paper had been consumed in reducing to writing the testimony under the law requiring the commissioners to report the testimony in wri ting, and proper .decisions made requisite to the payment of the two hundred dodars to that class of sufferers designated by the act of Congress. Such dispatch in Government agents gives abund ant evidence of national vigor and integrity. It was, no doubt, the object of this act of Con gress to make such an appropriation as would re lieve the sufferings of those who had lost ad pres ent means of support, and for the further purpose of ascertaining the whole amount of claims for damages as a necessary prerequisite to future leg islation. Regarded in this light, the act is one of wisdom and economy. On the 4th of May, A. D. 1863, at six o'clock in the afternoon, certain others of the Sioux Indians, squaws and pappooses, in ad about seventeen hun dred, left Fort Sneldng, on board the steamboat Davenport, for their new reservation on the Upper Missouri, above Fort Randad, accompanied by a strong guard of soldiers, and attended by certain of the missionaries and employes, the whole being under the general direction of Superintendent Clark W. Thompson. By these two shipments, some two thousand Sioux had been taken from the State and removed far from the borders of Minne sota. The expedition of 1863, fitted out against the scattered bands of the Sioux yet remaining on the borders of the State, or stid further removed into the Dakota Territory, gave to the border set tlements some assurance of protection and security"], [270, "HISTORY OF THE SIOUX MASSACRE. 256 first shot fired I laid down, and the man did not see me before father was kided. against any further disturbance from these partic ular bands of Indians. \"A short time before father was kdled an Indian named Hiuka, who married the daughter of my father's second wife, came to him.

He gave the coat to father, telling him he might need it when it rained, as he had no coat with him. Hiuka said he had a horse now, and was going back to the Indian country. DEATH OF LITTLE CROW. On Friday evening, July 3, 1863, Mr. Lampson and his son Chauncey, while traveling along the road, about six miles north of Hutchinson, discov ered two Indians in a little prairie opening in the woods, interspersed with clumps of bushes and vines and a few scattering poplars, picking berries. These two Indians were Little Crow and his son Wowinapa. STATEMENT BY HIS SON. \"The Indians that went down with us separated. Eight of them and the squaw went north; the other eight went further down. I have not seen any of them since.

When I got to Beaver creek I saw the tracks of two Indians, and at Standing Buffalo's village saw where the eight Indians that had gone north had crossed. \"I am the son of Little Crow; my name is Wo winapa; I am sixteen years old; my father had two wives before he took my mother; the first one had one son, the second one a son and daughter; the third wife was my mother.

I went on untd I arrived near Devil's Lake, when I staid in one place three days, being so weak and hungry that I could go no further. I had picked up a cartridge near Big Stone Lake, which I still had with me, and loaded father's gun with it, cutting the ball into slugs. With this charge I shot a wolf, ate some of it, which gave me strength to travel, and went on up the lake until the day I wa3 captured, which was twenty-six days from the day my father was kided.\" \"Father went to St. Joseph last spring. When we were coming back he said he could not fight the white men, but would go below and steal horses from them, and give them to his children, so that they could be comfortable, and then he would go away off. \"Father also told me that he was getting old, and wanted me to go with him to carry his bun dles. He left his wives and his other children be hind. There were sixteen men and one squaw in the party that went below with us. We had no horses, but walked all the way down to the settle ments.

Whde there are many mills on these streams, there are yet a large number of unim- proved water privileges awaiting the coming en- terprise which will create the necessity for their early occupancy. The portion of the county along the Mississippi and other rivers has a very rugged and somewhat forbidding appearance, with the irregular bluffs and oval hids with rock- capped summits. These, with alternating hids and valleys, extend back into the country several miles, and then gradually assume the form of a roding prairie with considerable timber, and stdl further on in the interior it becomes, in many places, a level prairie. The soil in the valleys be- tween the hills is remarkably good for farming purposes, with numerous springs gushing out from the hidsides, but really the best farms are on the high lands which have been largely used for rais- ing wheat. A general view of the county in an agricultural point, would divide it in this way One-eighth of the county would be hills and bluffs, perhaps a little less than this estimate would be correct. About one-fourth would be timber, and the remaining portion would be adapted to the raising of all crops grown in a like latitude, inclu ding stock raising. GENERAL DESCRIPTION POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS GEOLOGICAL FEATURES PRE-HISTORIO. Houston county is situated in the southeastern corner of the state of Minnesota, and has for neighbors, Winona county on the north, the Mis sissippi, with Wisconsin beyond, on the east, Al lamakee county in Iowa, on the south, and Fdl more county on the west. The county is about twenty-four miles square, and subdivided into seventeen townships, most of them corresponding with a township of govern ment survey in form, and none of them varying widely in size. It has 334,120 acres of land. The Mississippi, which flows along the east ern line, has several sloughs winding through a swampy belt of varying width, which is broader near the southern boundary of the county. The largest local river is the Root, which rises seventy-five miles or so west of the county, and runs in an easterly direction through the southern border of the northern tier of towns. Thompson's Creek, coming from the south, enters this river at Hokah, and the South Fork of Root River joins the main stream at Houston. From the north there are three good sized streams emptying into the Root River, the larger of which are Money Creek and Silver Creek. Diagonally across the northeastern comer of the county, in La Crescent township, runs Pine Creek finding an outlet in the Mississippi. Crooked Creek is in the second tier of towns above the Iowa state line, and running east enters the Mississippi. Six mdes or so south of this stream is Winnebago Creek running in a like easterly di- The character of the sod in its average quadty, is that rich, quick responding, warm sandy loam, pecudar to southern Minnesota, which first gave, and has sustained, the reputation of the farming lands of this region which produced, in years when wheat was the staple product of the sod, more than 1,500,000 bushels in the county in a single season.

An other road runs in the valley of the Root River east and west, connecting with the Mississippi road at the river. The third railroad in the county is the \"Caledonia and Mississippi,\" which, from the junction on the river, fodows up the Crooked Creek in a northerly direction to Caledonia, the shire town, where it deflects toward the south, and passes through Spring Grove, and thence on to Preston, its present terminus. This line was un dertaken by local enterprise and is of the standard narrow gauge. A complete description of these roads, which are now in the hands of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul company, will be found under the appropriate head. Taken all together it is produced by the same causes. The strata cover the same geological horizons, at least the same as the non-drift-covered portions of Fillmore county. It varies from un- dulating to rough and hilly. The surface of the rock was gorged by numerous canons, each with its tributary gorges, prior to the spreading of the loam. These gorges are not so narrow as in much of the western and central parts of Fidmore county, but are of the same character as those in the Shakopee and St. Croix areas \u2014 broader and smoother, allowing the loam, when deposited, to enter their deepest recesses and to spread itself evenly over the whole. While the loam itself be- comes thicker and more clayey toward the Missis- sippi River, it has so effectuady and so deeply covered the whole country that generady a rolling or undulating surface has resulted which is almost free from the peculiar sink-holes so common in the Trenton area, but is characterized by deep, wide valleys, and long ridges. The bluffs that enclose the valleys are sometimes tillable, or at least turfed over from top to bottom. They are of all heights from the more shadow depression suffi- cient for ready drainage, to valley lines over five hundred feet deep. The whole of Root River valley, which is in the St. Croix sandstone, is over five hundred feet in depth, with dmestone capping the bluffs. Some of its tributary vadeys are equally deep and wide, but the smaller tributary valleys become shallow and more rocky as the gorges ascend in the Lower Magnesian \u2014 the whole system making a series of deep valleys along the river, and of alternating vales and ridges at greater distance from the main valley. The county is nowhere destitute of excellent natural drainage. There are very few of the characteris- tic sink-holes of Trenton, that formation having but a small superficies in the county, and that not within the reach of important drainage causes which were capable of producing the pre-glacial gorges. Within the Shakopee area have been seen three or four similar sink-holes, but they differ from the Trenton sink-holes in being more plainly a part of continuous ravines, and in being broader in com parison to their depth. Political Subdivisions. \u2014 The county averages four townships square, but the divisions are such that on the river there are five of them, which gives the odd number of seventeen towns in the county. The first town on the northwest corner is Money Creek, which has an irregular southern boundary, with Root River and the Southern Min nesota railroad near the line. The next town go ing east is Houston, with a tongue of land extend ing west between Money Creek and Yucatan, with the Root River and railroad a few miles from the southern boundary. Then comes Mound Prairie nearly evenly bisected between north and south by the railroad and river. The last of the northern tier is La Crescent, which lies north of Root River, and perhaps Hokah, between this and through which the Root River runs, should also be included in the first tier. The next tier of townships begin ning on the west are Yucatan, Sheldon, Union, and Brownsville on the Mississippi. In the next row we find Black Hammer, Cale donia, the county seat, Mayvide, and Crooked Creek. The southern towns, along the Iowa state line, are Spring Grove, with the Caledonia railroad running diagonally through it from northeast to southwest, Wilmington, Winnebago, and Jefferson. These towns are specifically treated under their re spective names. SURFACE FEATURES. * The topography of Houston county is very similar to that of the eastern, and particularly that of the northeastern part of Fillmore county. If the valleys excavated by drainage were filled up, the county would be very nearly flat, the highest part being in the southwestern corner, in the area of the Trenton limestone. The great di versity of surface that appears arises entirely from *The following geological extracts are taken from the report of N. H. Wmchell, State Geologist."], [273, "GEOLOGICAL. 259 the effect of erosion by streams and atmospheric forces, on the rocks, which consists of alternating sandstones and limestones. This effect would be stid greater, or rather would be stid more apparent, were it not that the loess loam, which is very thick in this part of the State, tones down, with its over spreading canopy, the roughness which the rocky surface really possesses, leaving it actuady one of an undulating or rolling character except along the immediate river bluffs, where the rocks fre quently appear in craggy bluffs, and cause preci pitous or steep hillsides. The valleys excavated by the streams are remarkable and instructive. Not only have the larger streams cut out gorges of enormous depth in the rocky floors on which they run, but every little creek and tributary runs in a gorgewhich shows the same rock-sculpture. Even the freshet creeks, and the rivulets born after every summer shower, dry entirely the greater part of the year, find their way to the main valleys through rock-bound, canon-like valleys. This makes the county present the usual characters of southern latitudes where the northern drift sheet has not been spread. There is nothing more evi dent than that these valleys antedate the great ice age. In other portions of_the northwest where the drift does prevail, larger streams than those found in Houston county have generally worn their channels only through'the drift sheet. The Mississippi River itself, above the Falls of St. Anthony, has no rocky bluffs. It very rarely even strikes J;he rock. It is occupied] stdl dn dis solving and removing therk materials of the drift which covers that portion of the State. It would require'a great many inter- glacial periods, or pre glacial periods, to_texcavate it as deeply] as the same vadey is wrought in^the southeastern por tion\"of_the State. In the limestone areas the val leys are narrow-and more generally they widen out so as to enclose good farm lands on the bottoms in the^sandstone areas. This dis tinction,' however, is less evident than in !_Filhnore county, where the St. Peter sandstone plays a more important part in bringing about the present topo graphy. Iti is, however, well illustrated in the upper portion of many .of the tributaries of Root River. descending one of these valleys from the upland, the first descent is very rocky and very impracticable. This is caused at first by the cut through the Shakopee limestone. The Jordan sandstone that underlies the Shakopee sometimes relieves this ruggedness a little, but its thickness is so small compared to that of the whole Lower Magnesian that it is barely observable in this way. Through the underlying St. Lawrence limestone the descent is also rough, and the valley narrow, with little or no arable land in the valley. On reaching the horizon of the top of the St. Croix sandstone, the change introduced into the aspect of the valley is very noticeable. It widens, the rock is seen exposed in a nearly continuous escarp ment along the tops of the now more distant bluffs, the descent is easy, the stream flows with a winding course, and is perhaps fringed with a small shrubby growth, the lower slopes of the bluffs on either side are turf-covered, and finady a rich alluvial sod, spreading out over the bottoms show here and there a spot that has been cleared and cultivated. This character then extends to, and follows the whole course of Root River to its mouth, the valley constantly increasing in width and showing a terraced condition, where ancient floods or periods of high water have stood, and whence, after vast accumulations of alluvium, have retired, reducing the river at last to its pres ent insignificant dimensions. This is the general character of the valley tributary to Root River, but this succession of changes can be seen with in Houston county, only in those tributary valleys on the south side of Root River. Those on the north side enter on the St. Croix sandstone before reaching Houston. The best agricultural portion of the county is in the centre and southwest quar ter. The valleys throughout the county are gener ady wooded, and in the eastern part of the county a great deal of the upland is also wooded. Taken altogether the county may be denominated rolling, broken and hilly, though there are also some fine prairies that are simply undulating. All the farms are well drained naturally. The fodowing measurements by aneroid will show the depth of some of the vadeys below the immediate upland at the points named. Section seventeen, Caledonia, three milles south of Sheldon. Beaver Creek, at the great spring, is 230 feet below the tops of the bluffs, which em brace the Shakopee limestone, Jordan sandstone and a part of the St. Lawrence sandstone.

SPRING GROVE. At Brownsville, the height of the bluff above the fiood plain of the Mississippi is 495 feet. Mr. Fred. Gluck, of Brownsvdle, measured the same by triangulation in the winter season, and obtained 486 feet as the height above the ice. Railroad surveyors are said to have obtained 483 feet as the height of the same bluff. The most of this height is made up of sandstone, there being but 105 feet ol hmestone in the upper part of the bluff be longing to the St. Lawrence formation. Along the northwest edge of this town the South Fork of Root River causes a deep valley which is rough, timbered, and rocky.

In the east ern portion of the town the surface is more undorm and open. Area, 22,854.31 acres. THE SOIL AND TIMBER OF HOUSTON COUNTY. The soil of the county is formed by the loess loam. It is very fertile, and apparently very en during. It is mainly a clayey deposit, without stones or gravel, but yet in some places becomes arenaceous, the sand grains being very fine. The loess is hardly pervious to water. In the scarcity and costhness of common wells, many farmers re sort to the expedient of retaining the surface water, after rains, in open reservoirs produced by throw ing a low dam across some of the shallow drain age valleys that intersect their farms, thus form ing with the common loam a smad pool or lake for the use of their stock. Except on the brows of the bluffs which enclose the valleys this loam is thick enough to make a reliable subsoil as wed as suface soil. In some of the vadeys it is very thick, but here it is apt to be influenced by the causes that produced the river terraces, and to mingle TOWNSHIP 103 N., RANGE 7 W. SOUTH PART OF YUCATAN.

TOWNSHIP 104 N., RANGE 5 W. NORTH PART OF HOKAH AND EAST PART OF LA ORESCENT. This is a Mississippi River town, and between the line of the river bluffs and the channel of the river is a belt of bottom land, much of it marshy, from two to four miles wide. The Root River cuts a deep gorge across the southern part of the town,"], [276, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 262 with the ordinary alluvium. On the uplands, gen erally, where it may not have been reduced by wash, its average thickness might reach thirty feet, but in some of the valleys material of the same aspect is sometimes encountered to the depth of over one hundred feet. three parts, Shakopee Limestone, Jordan sandstone, and St. Lawrence limestone, and underlying the greater portion of the county. The St. Croix sandstone, which is found only in the bluffs of the Mississippi and Root Rivers, and of their tributary valleys. In the valley of Root River, and also along the Mississippi, the sod of the aduvial terraces, greatly resembling that of the loam in the uplands, is apt to be more sandy, and sometimes becomes very light and very poor. These materials are gener ally seen to be in obdquely stratified layers, and to embrace, in the Mississippi valley, smad gravel stones of northern origin. The immediate flood plain of these rivers presents stid another variety of soil. Whde it is generally sandy, and often very light, it is also a very rich soil, and is apt to be enduring by reason of the Nile-dke overflows to which it is subjected, and the decomposition of large quantities of vegetation. This variety of sod sustains some of the heaviest forests to be found in the county. THE TRENTON LIMESTONE. The greater portion of this formation, which is found within the county, is of the Lower Trenton, so-called, and produces the same topographical features as in Fillmore county. The reader is re ferred to the report of progress for 1875, where the geology of that county is given, and the effect of the Lower Trenton on the surface features is discussed and dlustrated by diagrams. This formation is found in Spring Grove and Wilmington townships. It runs also in a nar row, but interrupted belt, nearly to Caledonia, where it may be distinctly seen, in its peculiar features, and its flat-topped mounds, or tables, a mile west of that vdlage. There is reason to sup pose that it formerly extended much further east than it does now, covering the most, perhaps the whole, of the county, and being continuous with the horizon of the same formation on the east of the Mississippi, in Wisconsin. It is noticeable that many of the vadeys, partic ularly those running east and west, as Crooked Creek valley, have the bluffs along the north side of the creek, destitute, or nearly so, of timber, but are heavily timbered along the opposite bluffs, on the south side. This may be due to warm days in winter or early spring, when the sap may have started in the trees on the north bluffs, followed by severely cold weather, before the actual setting in of steady warm weather. Of course the sun's heat would be quickest felt on the bluffs facing south. This process repeated for a good many years, would injure and at last destroy the timber on the north bluffs, if it were ever possible for trees to have come to maturity there, whde tim ber on the south bluffs would escape these sudden changes, owing to the shaded condition of the bluffs during the warmest portion of the day, and would only experience a steady increase of warmth due to the progress of the season. The usual characters of the Lower Trenton, both lithological and pal\u00e6ontological, were the only ones noticed in Houston county. It has been opened for quarries only in the vicinity of Spring Grove. It generally presents a stained and long weathered aspect, as if split and dissolved by the action of water. The layers are at first about an inch in thickness, but become thicker, by adher ing to each other, on being wrought to some depth, and possess a blue color. ST. PETER SANDSTONE. This lies next below the Trenton. Its area em braces not only the slope from the high table-land of the Trenton area, but also a belt extending in width from the foot of that slope over the more level county surrounding, so that its irregular area is often a mde or two in width. As already remarked, while its upper limit has a very easdy recognized location, by reason of the terrace-like topography of the Lower Trenton, its lower hori zon is often very uncertain on account of the very easy and gradual destruction of its layers, and the prevalence of the loess loam. THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE. The rocks of Houston county are embraced whody within the Lower Sdurian. They are as follows: The Trenton limestone, confined to the south western quarter. The St. Peter sandstone, in an irregular area surrounding the area of the Trenton above. The Lower Magnesian formation, comprising the The thickness of the St. Peter sandstone was"], [277, "GEOLOGICAL. 263 very satisfactorily ascertained on the southwest quarter of section seventeen, Wilmington. The well of Mr. O. A. Bye is situated near the Trenton bluff, and by uniting the known depth drilled in the sandsone with aneroid measurement of the bluff, the St. Peter was found to be between sev enty-five and eighty feet thick, the Shakopee be low having a thickness of sixty-four feet. they lie long after the non-sdicious portions of the rock have dissolved and disappeared. Such cherty lumps are often a foot, or even two or three feet in diameter. They are roughened by cavities open ing on the surface, by dissolution of the most cal careous parts, and by the^natural openings and pores they acquired in the act of formation. They are the only portions of the formation in which fos sils have been found in Houston county. These masses sometimes show surfaces of drusy quartz crystals, also amethyst crystals, and great quanti ties of pyrites, oxydized and hydrated so as to pro duce a limonite, the form of the crystal alone re maining to indicate the original mineral. A care ful study of these fossils has not yet been [made, but there is some evidence, from the handling to which some of them have been subjected in the ex amination of the Trenton fossils now going on, that the Shakopee hmestone is the equivalent of the Chazy of New York, a formation which has not been recognized in the State, though \" the St. Peter has been regarded by Prof. Hall as its equi valent. THE SHAKOPEE LIMESTONE. The continuity of this formation from the Min nesota valley to the Mississippi, and its identity with the limestone at Shakopee, where it was first recognized as a distinct member of the Lower Magnesian in Minnesota, was fully established in the survey of Houston county. It is everywhere dis tinct as the uppermost portion of the Lower Mag nesian, and is everywhere separated from the other great calcareous member of the same forma tion by a sandstone as distinct and continuous, and as clearly recognizable, as the St. Peter sandstone. There can be no further question of its existence and its great extent. There seems every reason to believe also that it exists across the Mississippi, in the state of Wisconsin, but at this time there is no distinct published notice of its occurrence there. The Lower Magnesian in Wisconsin has been divided by Prof. R. Irving, of the Geological Survey of Wisconsin, into three parts, as exempd fied near Madison, {American Journal of Science and Arts, June, 1875,) but there is much reason to believe that his proposed subdivisions do not include the Shakopee limestone at all, and that the distinctions in the Lower Magnesian which he mentions are wholly confined to the St. Lawrence limestone of Minnesota. This subject was dis cussed by the writer in the Bulletin of the Minne sota Academy of Natural Sciences, for 1875, when this hypothesis was first published. It is ren dered still more plausible, in the absence of fur thor facts in Wisconsin, from the fact that even in Houston county the St. Lawrence exhibits varia tions of composition and lithology which are com parable to those Prof. Irving describes. This formation does not appear in the bluffs of the Mississippi River, in Houston county, nor in those of Root River generally; but its dne of strike is some mdes back in the country away from the immediate bluffs. This is due to the crumbling nature of the Jordan sandstone -which underlies it, and which operates, in that respect, to tear down the Shakopee in the same manner, and for the same causes, as the St. Peter on the Trenton. To this fact, and to its general resem blance to the St. Lawrence limestone, may be attri buted the non-discovery of this limestone by the United States geologists who have reported on the geology of the State, or by others, whose exam inations were largely confined to the main water courses, before the general settlement of the State, and the construction of good roads. This hmestone may be seen frequently in the central portion of the county, in the upper reaches of the ravines which radiate in all directions from the vicinity of Caledonia. It is seldom quarried, or used for any purpose, for the St. Lawrence hme stone is generally accessible in the immediate neighborhood, and that is much more desirable for budding-stone, or for lime-making. In de scending the ravine toward the quarries east of Caledonia, the Shakopee is the first hmestone seen exposed. The quarries are much lower \u2014 in the The characters of the Shakopee in Houston county are not noticeably different from those mentioned in the reports of progress for 1873 and 1875. Its bedding is much less regular than that of the St. Lawrence. It is apt, indeed, to be dis turbed by cherty, or concretionary masses, which, on the weathering away of the bluffs, become de tached and fall into the bottom of the valley, where"], [278, "264 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. St. Lawrence. It may be seen also in the upper tributary vadeys that feed Badger, Beaver, Crys sal, and Thompson Creeks. It causes the first rugged or rocky portion of those valleys. It is exposed in the tops of the bluffs at the great spring, section seventeen, Caledonia, three mdes south of Sheldon. Its thickness at Mr. O. A. Bye's, section seventeen, Wilmington, when drilled through, was found to be sixty-four feet, which is probably about its average thickness throughout the county. stoue, are also sometimes very much brecciated, rendering it at once more firm, but also more re fractory. It furnishes more stone for budding than ad the other formations of the county com bined. It is of a light, lively color, and endures the weather perfectly, showing not the least change in the oldest buildings in which it has been used. THE ST. CROIX SANDSTONE, This name was applied, in the first annual re port, provisionally to the light-colored, and often friable, sandstones which occur along the Missis sippi River in Minnesota, and which have by some been regarded as the stratigrapical equiva lent of the Potsdam sandstone of New York. This was done because, in the existence of another formation, of different lithology, affirmed also to be the equivalent of the New York Potsdam, it was necessary to have some designation for each of them. It seemed from considerations there given, that the lower of these two sandstones was the probable equivalent of that formation in New York, and in subsequent reports, while no facts have been gathered that confirm that view, the survey not having been carried on where these rocks are exposed, the provisional name has been continued. It is only in the county of Houston that any opportunity has been afforded for an examination of this formation, since the season of 1872. THE JORDAN SANDSTONE. The lithological features of this sandstone are nearly the same as those of the St. Peter, but it has only about one-half the thickness of the St. Peter. Its area of outcrop is quite smad, and its exposures are few. As it des between two hard limestones, which are apt to form perpendicular, walled bluffs, its line of outcrop is known by a belt of non-exposure of rock separating the Shak opee from the St. Lawrence, which is less steep in the ascent, and perhaps turfed over. It often be comes rusty and firm from a cement of iron, when it endures longer exposure, and is seen as detached blocks in the vadeys. Some blocks of this kind are visible by the roadside in the ravine that de scends to the quarries of Aiken and Molitor, a mde east of Caledonia. THE ST. LAWRENCE LIMESTONE. It is not intended here to enter upon an exam ination of the evidences of the parallelism of this sandstone with any eastern formation, nor to cite or compare authorities one way or the other. Con siderable has been written on the sandstone of the Lake Superior region as developed in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Canada, tending to show the ex istence of two distinct sandstone formations. Prof. Irving (American Journal, 3d Series, Vol. VHI, p. 46) reports three different sandstones ex isting in the North-west involved in this disputed horizon, as exemplified in his study of north-west ern Wisconsion, viz. : ( 1 ) Copper-bearing, highly tilted sandstones, conglomerates, and shales, asso ciated with trap. (2) Horizontal, aluminous, red sandstones, lighter than those associated with the trap, which \"\u25a0appear to dip underneath the light colored Lower Silurian sandstones of the Missis sippi valley,\" and (3) the hght-colored sandstones of the Mississippi vadey. In this he agrees with Dr. C. Rominger (Vol. I, p. 95, Palaeozoic Rocks, Geological Survey of Michigan, ) who makes them This is the most important formation in the county. It not only occupies a greater superficial area of outcrop than any other, but it takes the most prominent part in causing the varied topog raphy of the county. It surmounts the St. Croix sandstone, an easily eroded rock, into which the vadeys are deeply and rapidly cut, and maintains a bold and sharp outline along their tops. It is the immediate cause of a great many hids and ridges. It confronts the observer in every nook and on every promontory along the whole course of the Root River, and down the Mississippi bluffs as far as the State line, and it is especiady con spicuous in the httle valleys that ascend from the streams, and that often are more rocky than the larger vadeys. The thickness of the St. Lawrence in Houston county is about 200 feet, though other geologists have reported it as 250 feet thick at La Crosse. It is a dolomite, or magnesian hmestone. Its layers, whde generally regular and useful as a building-"], [279, "GEOLOGICAL. 265 \u2014 (1) Copper- bearing rocks, (2) Lower Division of the Lake Superior sandstone, and (3) the upper division of the Lake Superior sandstone. Brooks and Pumpelly, however, do not make mention of but two series of sandstones in the Lake Superior region, viz.: (1) The copper-bearing series, and (2) the Silurian sandstones. (Michigan Geolog ical Survey. Vol. I, Part I, pp. 75 and 185 ; and Part II, p. 1.) Foster and Whitney, in 1851, re ferred all the sandstones in question to the Pots dam of N. Y., regarding them as deposited over an uneven surface, producing local cross- stratification and unconformability. (Report on the Geology of the Lake Superior Land District. Part II, p. 120.) In this they were seconded by Prof. James Hall, and followed by Prof. J. D. Dana in his Geological Manual, First Edition. More lately, in 1862, Prot. Hall parallelized the uppermost of these sandstones with the New York Potsdam, (16th Regents' Report, p. 119,) with the caution ary remark that \"it may not yet be regarded as proved that the sandstone from which I have de scribed these fossils is in all respects the equiva lent of the Potsdam sandstone of New York, Ver mont, and Canada. It may represent more, or it may represent less than that formation. The lower accessible beds of the Mississippi valley may represent the Potsdam of one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet in thickness in the typical localities in New York, while the middle and upper beds of the West may be of epochs not rep resented in that part of the series studied in New York.\" As long as the Potsdam sandstone at the typical localities in New York was accepted as the base of the fossiliferous primordial strata, while at the West there are two recognized sedimentary sandstones, though not yet proved fossiliferous, lying below the sandstones of the Mississippi val ley, it seems quite presumptious to affirm the hor izontality of the light-colored sandstones with the New York Potsdam, especially when, as admitted by Prof. Hall, \"there are no species of fossils in the western sandstones which are positively ident ical with those of New York.\" It would be more in keeping with the recognized stratigraphical laws, to allow that formation which in New York begins with the top of the \"azoic\" to begin there also in Minnesota. be no misunderstanding of the horizon under con sideration. It is perfectly legitimate, in the fur ther investigation of this question, for the geolo gists of States further east to inquire which of the sandstones lying below these beds may be the equivalent of the New York Potsdam, for it seems as d on ascertained stratigraphical evidence, as well as on hthological and pal\u00e6ontological facts that are undisputed, these beds occupy a much higher horizon. They seem rather to be embraced in the great calciferous or Canadian epoch. Although these sandstone beds occupy the river bluffs along the Mississippi and the Root River throughout the county, they afford but very few opportunities for satisfactory examination. They are in the lowest part of the bluffs, and are gener ally hid by a sloping talus that is usually turfed over. The only point at which a useful section of their composition could be had was at Hokah. The general section at this place, as nearly as it could be made out, is as follows, in descending order : GENERAL SECTION AT HOKAH. Feet.

(Causes the blind terrace at Houston) 25 At Houston, the bluffs north of the village are 520 feet in height, and of this the lower 420 feet at least belong to the St. Croix sandstone. They probably contain the St. Croix twenty feet fur ther up, shown by the toppling over of huge blocks of St. Lawrence hmestone, from the crumbdng out of friable sandrock along the sahent angles of the bluffs. The intervals of the sandstone layers is mainly turfed over so as to render an inspection of their contents imposible, except at points near the top and near the bottom. There is a line of nearly constant exposure about forty feet below the top of the St. Croix, occupying an interval of thirty or forty feet, which is particularly noticeable along the north side of the river. There is another exposure of these beds near the level of the river at the dam at Houston. The former con sists of a hard, firm sandrock, and the latter is soft and crumbdng, with cross stratification. Above the due of constant exposure, about twenty five feet, is a blind terrace which occasionally reveals the rock which causes it. It is a sandstone, and is included in the foregoing thickness of 420 feet. The line of constant exposure mentioned as oc- curring at Houston, near the top of the St. Croix sandstone, lies below this section. This line is more evident in the north than on the south bluffs \u2014 due, probably, to the erosive action of the pre vailing winds, which are from the southwest, and to the greater scarcity of timber on the north bluffs, as already noted under the head of Soil and Timber. The fossils that have been gathered from this formation consists very largely of trdobite remains. On section eleven, Union township, the sand- stone which has been mentioned as having a nearly constant line of exposure, is sculptured, along the north bluffs, into isolated columns and tables, with some rounded buttresses which present a very conspicuous and highly interesting in stance of atmospheric erosion. There can be no doubt that the bluffs themselves are the result of the erosion of the valley by water by a process that began thousands of years before the glacial epoch, but the present condition of most of the curious forms, like that of the \"sculptured bluffs,\" is certainly due to the effect of wind in conjunc tion with moisture and frost. There are also cavi ties and sheltered nooks, and deep, crooked pas sages and sharp niches in which the wind could barely enter, and from which there could not have been any wind exit sufficient to have maintained a current capable of producing the most of this sculpture, which, moreover, are lichen-covered, and bear an aspect of age and roughness that forbids their reference to any present atmos pheric forces. These can be explained only by the solvent action of water in agitation, and are com parable to the purgatories that are often seen about the rocky shores of lakes or of the ocean. But when the rock shows a recent, fresh erosion, and is soft and crumbling, the present forms are due to At one mile north of Sheldon there is an ap parent dip in the outcropping upper edge of the St. Croix, as it strikes across the bluffs. Its di rection is perhaps a little west of south, and amounts to two or three degrees. It is entirely local, and the corresponding upward dip in the opposite direction is invisible. The bluffs south and north have their usual height. * No such dip was noticed in any other part of Houston county, but it is very likely this is on the strike of the noticeable dip in these formations which has been mentioned by Dr. Owen, and by the geologists of Iowa as occurring in the bluffs of the Mississippi River at McGregor and Lansing, in the state of Iowa. In Caledonia township, section two, the fodow ing section was taken : * Compare Geology of Iowa, Hall & Whitney, 1858, part II, p. 51."], [281, "GEOLOGICAL 267 more recent causes, and can only be assigned to wind and frost. to the non-submergence of this region since tlie de- posit of the Silurian rocks and their elevation above the ocean. If it were demonstrated or gen- erady bedeved that the prevalence of the drift in other parts of the Northwest in the same latitude, is dUfe to the submergence of the continent be- neath the ocean since the Tertiary age, this as- sumed cause would be apropos. But, on the con- trary, it is pretty generady agreed _by geologists both in America and Europe, that the drift is due to the former existence of glaciers that covered the surface of the country, and, moving generady southward, not only brought from the northern regions the foreign substances that constitute the drift, but required, for their existence, that the land surface should be raised several hundred feet at least above the ocean during their prevalence.* Again there is every reason to suppose this region has been submerged since the age of the Sdurian. It is difficult to conceive what could have pro- duced the horizontal lamination of the loess loam, unless it be attributed to the action of standing or slightly agitated water. This loam not only ex ists along the immediate river valley, but is spread widely over the highlands of the whole district. It is true there is no evidence of its having been the product of marine depositions, on the contra ary it is evidently of fresh water origin; but that the country has been deeply submerged and re mained so for a long period within recent geolog ical time can hardly be questioned. There is also reason to believe that some portions of it were buried beneath the waters of the Cretaceous THE DRIFT. The true northern drift is not spread over this county. It contains no drift clay, nor boulders of foreign origin. There is a thin deposit of for eign gravel at Riceford, in the extreme southwestern part of the county, and there is a terrace along the Mississippi River that is made up of gravel and sand of northern origin, but this county wholly escaped the operation of those forces which spread the well-known drift clay and boulders over the most of the State. Whether any former glacial era caused it to be covered with the ice of the northern glaciers cannot be determined, since the materials left by that era, d any there were, may have been decomposed, and may have entered into the stratified clays and the soils of the Mississippi valley further south under the combined influence of time, and the intense activity of the destruc tive forces of the latest glacial era. There is to be seen occasionally a local drift, or debris, derived from the rock of the country round about, and this sometimes has a deceitful resem- blance to true northern drift, yet it can always be distinguished from it on examination. On the northwest quarter of section twenty-five, Cale- donia, along the road, near the brow of the Sha- kopee limestone, there is a bank of such loose ma- terial. There is a cut of about three feet which consists mainly of rusty loam, rather sandy, em- bracing large masses of black quartzite, which also vary to a lighter color but show very little, if any, lime. Other lumps consist of pyrite crystals, now converted to limonite, and of rusty, hardened sand- stone, perhaps from the St. Peter. These last, in- deed, comprise, perhaps a majority of the stony masses. There are also large quantities of ordi- nary chert, and an occasional piece of water-worn limestone. The bank shows no stratification, but consists of these materials simply mingled with the loam. The whole appears red and rusty, but discloses not a single piece but can be referred to the Lower Magnesian formation. ocean. In the light as the more recent investigations of geologists, it is safe to take for granted the fol lowing conclusions respecting the drift, so far as they bear on this question. 1st. That the earth suffers such changes of climate that, after the lapse of long periods, the temperate latitudes become frigid, and are covered with continental ice-fields or glaciers, which have a slow movement southward. 2d. That between these periods conditions of more genial climate prevad, when vegetation and animal life return slowly to inhabit the countries from which they had been driven by the rigors of the previous cold. As to the cause of this exemption of a part of southwestern Minnesota, and portions of Wiscon sin, Iowa, and Hlinois adjacent, from the forces of the northern drift epoch, there has been but one opinion advanced, so far as the writer is aware. It is that of Prof. J. D. Whitney, who attributes it *Those interested in this subject will find it exhaustively treated in James Geikie's Great Ice Age, and its relation to the antiquity of Man. Second Edition, 1877."], [282, "268 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 3d. That the severity of the cold during the successive glacial epochs is not always the same; but that the ice-fields are more extensive during some than during others. extremity of the lake, have a west-southwesterly direction. Now it is a striking coincidence that this drift less tract des nearly south and in the lee of this wedge-like area of metamorphic rock, and would be protected from the ice-fiow by it. It is hence reasonable to infer that the absence of the' drift in this region is due to the existence of this protect ing barrier lying to the north of it in Wisconsin, while further to the south the two main branches of the ice-fiow again united and spread, before their final retirement, a continuous sheet of drift over central Illinois and southern Iowa. These continental ice-fields, while conforming in general to the laws and conditions of a solid, yet exhibited, as glaciers do now, many of the charac teristics of a plastic body, warped and moved by the force of gravity, and hence exemplified many of the principles of running water. The tendency for them was to seek the low lands, and avoid the natural obstructions presented by mountains or by hids. It is very evident, from the fact that the remains of an older drift sheet are found under the loam in some of the western parts of this tract, whde the latest drift sheet does not spread so far nor so wide, that the last period of cold was far less in tense than some former one had been. This last drift sheet is spread over the ancient soil, contain ing vegetation in a nearly continuous layer, the remains of a forest which flourished between the two glacial periods, along the margin of the last ice-field. This belt, characterized by buried soils and wood, crosses Fidmore and Olmsted counties, and it is probably true, that wherever such re mains are found, in a flat country like southern Minnesota, lying under glacial drift, they mark the point where glacial ice ceased to act power fully enough to disrupt the old soils. Such an cient soils may have existed on the top of older glacial drift, or on any other surface. It is prob able that it was during the prevalence of the last glacial period, or just as the ice began to recede so as to produce copious waters, that the loess loam of the Mississippi vadey was deposited over this region, and that at the same time the waters of the Minnesota were augmented by the drainage of the entire Winnepeg and Red River valleys through its channel, some of them at first reach ing the Mississippi and through the Cannon and the Vermillion River vadeys. At first these waters spread irregularly and widely, fluctuating with the seasons, so as to leave no recognizable beach lines; but at length, when the most of the State had been left by the retreating glacier, they became more uniform in their volume and were confined to the actual river gorge. They seem to have maintained, for a long period, a pretty uniform stage at this point, for when, on the drainage of the Winnepeg basin toward the north, consequent In examining the topography and the geologi cal structure of the country lying to the north of this so-called driftless tract, it is evident that the great valley of the Lake Superior region, once oc cupied by glacial ice, would overfiow, both first and last, along the hnes of the lowest outlet, and that perhaps the higher and less passable parts along its southern barrier-shore would never be entirely surmounted. The continental glacier, in this region, would flow toward the southwest or south, guided by the main topographical features. In north-central Wisconsin is an isolated area of granitic and metamorphic rock, which not only extends to the shore of Lake Superior, but wedges out northeastwardly in the form of a long, high, and persistent point or spur, in the southern part of Lake Superior, known as Kewenaw Point, in the state of Michigan. It is plain to see that this point would act on a crowding but somewhat flex ible mass of ice as an entering wedge to split it into two main masses, and that the widening of the wedge, in the granitic region of northern Wiscon sin, would perpetuate the division so as to cause, if other topography were favorable, a constant flow along the northwest side, and another in a more southerly direction, that would spread over northern Michigan and find its easiest exit through the valleys of Lakes Michigan and Huron. Ac cording to Prof. R, Irving and Messrs. Foster & Whitney,* the western end of Lake Superior lies in an Archaean synclinal trough running south westerly. This again would divert the flowing ice over the northeastern portions of Minnesota to the expense of northern Wisconsin.

The high water in the Mississippi as cended the gorges of the tributary streams, re tarding their flow and causing similar terraces along their lower reaches. been kept there without the aid of the Winnipeg waters. Root River valley, between the rock bluffs, has an average width, through Houston county of about two miles, and that would have been the width of the stream, with a depth of over 100 feet. There is, besides this high, loam- terrace, a sec ond terrace level, visible speciady at La Crescent, on the Mississippi, which there rises fifty feet above the flood plain of the river and spreads out in a pleant plateau on which the village has been lo cated. This terrace is made of gravel and pebbles of northern origin and was identified only along the Mississipi. The largest stones it contains are three inches in longest diameter. It is passed through in wells and seems to be entirely pervious to water, as all wells on it get water at about the level of the flood plain of the river. This material is used for grading and road-bed, on the Chicago, Dubuque & Minnesota railroad and elsewhere. It consists entirely of rounded waterworn materials, the main part being the usual parti-colored quartzite peb bles, granitic, homblendic, amyglaloidal, and lamellar, as well as nniform and massive. A great many of them have a red color, or some shade varying from red. The coarsest pieces are rare, found only in the upper portions of the debris of alluvial fans. ALLUVIAL TERRACES. There is a marked alluvial terrace that accom- panies the Mississippi and Root Rivers, and ascends their lower tributaries, but it does not seem to be true that all the streams are terraced before reach- ing the level of this terrace. This indicates that the high water which produced that terrace was due to backing up from the Mississippi, and that possibly the country itself in general was not more wet than at present; in other words, that the amount of surface drainage that passed down the valleys was no grrater than now. Root River was simply wider and deeper, with a sluggish cur- rent, due to the greater volume of the Mississippi. The highest point at which the terraced condition of the Root River has been observed is Preston, in Fillmore county, but it must certainly extend sev- eral miles further up that valley. By aneroid measurements, united with the levels of the Southern Minnesota railroad, the height of this terrace at Preston is found to be about 300 feet above the Grand Crossing of the Southern Min- nesota radroad near the mouth of Root River, whde the same terrace at Hokah, likewise near the mouth of Root River, is only about 100 feet above the flood plain. It is also probable that the loam terrace, as seen at La Crescent, is the same contin- ued to and coalescent with the Mississippi terrace ; and there it is ninety feet above the Mississippi flood plian. This would necessitate a fall of about 200 feei in the Root River at its highest stage, in a distance of fifty miles in a right line. If this fall can be explained consistently with the assumed back-water condition of the Root River, at that time, it will further confirm the hypothesis that the Mississippi then drained the Red River and Winnipeg regions, receiving their waters from the Minnesota. It seems further that this explanation is necessary to the maintenance of that hypothesis ; for if the Root River was maintained at that high level by the demands of its own drainage area, then much more the Mississippi could also have The following more special observations were made on these terraces in Houston county. At Sheldon, six miles from Root River, in the valley of Beaver Creek, the terrace on which the Newberry House stands is thirty feet above the water of the craek below the dam. The materials of the terrace at this place are sandy loam, horizontady stratified, with more clay near the top, and less evident stratification. At Houston the only observable terrace, meas ured about a mile west of the city, is sixty five feet above the flood plain. The track of the rad road is about one foot above the flood plain of the river, which is eighteen feet higher than the water below the mill-dam. At Money Creek the terrace rises thirty feet above the flood plain which is twenty feet above low water below the mill-dam. The contents of the terrace are stratified.

At Yucatan, the terrace flat is forty feet above the present flood-plain of the South Fork of Root River. The flood-plain is six feet above low water. The full height of the bank is about twenty feet where the section is taken. At a point further to the right a couple of bones were found, but in the confused and broken uppermost layer. They were where that layer comes down to the river, and about three feet below the surface, or five feet above the water of the dam, the surface of the bank sloping about 45 \u00b0 . At Freeburg, the terrace is twenty feet above the flood-plain of Crooked Creek, which is five feet above the water of the creek. WELLS IN HOUSTON COUNTY. At Hokah, the village is on a terrace sixty-five feet above the flood-plain of Root River, and there is a distribution of loam about .the bluffs at a higher level, (as well as at many other points along Root River valley ) reaching to a hundred feet, or a dttle more, above the flood-plain. This loam appears in indistinct benches or terrace-levels or patches of terrace, rising often with a slope, far up the rock-bluffs. It very rarely appears level, as a well-marked terrace. It suggests rather a worn-out terrace-level, the upper surface of which has suffered erosion by being gudied out and smoothed off toward the river. It is generady cultivated for farms, and has good wheat fields, consisting of the same materials as the lower ter race. Its actual height is difficult to ascertain. A few wells situated in the vadey of the Root River have disclosed vegetable remains at about the level of the flood-plain, and probably the ter races generady cover a layer of vegetable remains that was caused by the decay and burial of pre glacial plants. This has only been detected, so far as known, at Hokah, and at La Crescent. At the former place the wed of Isaac West was filled again because the \"muck-bed\" rendered the water unfit for use.

Efforts that have been made to secure facts in reference to this discovery, and further account of the bone, have been unsuccessful. that furnishes good stone for building, though much of that which is used is taken from the sur face near the tops of the bluffs, having been loosened and broken up by the weather. On the north-east quarter, section eleven, Cale donia, is Mrs. M. Brown's stone house, built of the Lower Magnesian. Throughout the county are numerous springs, some of which are very large, and gush out along the valleys. They seem to be the outlets of sub terranean streams. Those above Riceford furnish the water for the flouring mills at that place. There is also a large one on section seventeen, Caledonia, three miles south of Sheldon. They seem to frequent the horizon of about eighty feet below the top of the St. Lawrence limestone, and indicate a shaly, or otherwise impervious layer there in that formation. Mr. J. Kline has a fine farm-house of stone taken from the St. Lawrence, on section nineteen, Union. Near Mr. Kline's quarry is another owned by Henry Snure. There is another on section twenty nine, Union, owned by Michael Wilhelm. L. Svenson's is on section two, ( southeast ) Houston. The principal quarries at Hokah, now worked, are those of Nath. Whiteman, in the St. Croix sandstone, and Widow Prindle. The stone of Mr. Whiteman's quarry is a harsh, argidaceous sand- rock, in layers a few inches thick, which becomes firmer on exposure. The best budding stone lies higher up in the bluffs, and was opened in Mt. Tom by the Southern Minnesota radroad, for the . construction of their shops. It is from the St. Lawrence. MATERIAL RESOURCES. The rocks of the county do not contain any valuable minerals. They are everywhere abun dantly exposed, and are quarried at many places for ordinary bud ding -stone and quicklime. BUILDING STONE. At. La Crescent, the public school-house was built of stone from Potter & Taylor's quarry, like wise in the St. Lawrence, north of La Crescent, in the edge of Winona county. At Spring Grove, the Lutheran society have built a large church of brick, the basement being from the Lower Trenton, in layers of four to six inches, taken from quarries near the village. The heavy trimmings are from the St. Lawrence hme stone. The quarries are owned by George Timan son and Ole Tostenson. Lang's brewery, on section twenty-eight, Ho kah, is a large stone building near the river built of limestone from near the top of the bluff. There is also a fine stone farm-house owned by Wm. Splitter, on section twenty-one, La Crescent, in Root River valley. The Nunnery, on section twenty-eight, La Crescent, was constructed of stone got from the bluffs near, including also that used for quickdme. These are ad from the St. Law rence. The Toledo Woolen Mill, of Fletcher & Wd liams, section five, La Crescent, is built of the St. Lawrence, quarried near. At Caledonia, the St. Lawrence is extensively used for building, quarried about a mile east of the village. The German Catholic church is the principal building made of it, being also the largest building in the place. The county jail is a fine building of the same, the courses being about ten inches thick, rubble dressed, with trim mings of the same. The business blocks of Nicholas Koob, J. J. Belden, John Krantz, Joseph Vossen, Jaeob Bouquet, and Nix Erstine are also constructed of the same stone. The quarries are owned by John Molitor, John Dorsh, Anton Molitor, Widow Cunningham, and John Aiken. On Winnebago Creek, on section twenty-two, Winnebago, Mr. T. B. Barber, has a stone flour ing mid. O. T. West has a hmestone quarry at Brows vdle, which supplied heavy stone for the radroad and for other uses. Mr. Job Brown's, at the same place, furnished the hmestone foundation for the pubdc school-house. The foregoing are a few of the stone buildings in the county, but there are several others which, though noticed in the progress of the survey, were not carefudy located, and cannot be referred to. The St. Lawrence supplies by far the greater portion of the building-stone used in the county. On section twenty-four, Spring Grove, Mr. K. Gilbertson has a two-story stone residence on his farm, quarried from the Trenton. At Money Creek, Harvey Chapel has a quarry"], [286, "272 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. There is not a single known workable quarry in the Shakopee, though exposed as favorably as the St. Lawrence. It is uniformly ignored. It is harder to work, has cherty lumps and siliceous concretions which not only disturb the bedding but renders it difficult to cut into desired shapes, and is generally in thinner layers. The color is much the same as that of the St. Lawrence, being buff, or slightly salmon-colored, but the St. Law rence is, where most used for building, also some what open or vesicular in texture. Thus, mortar sets firmly upon it, and forms a sutured attach ment. When the St. Lawrence stone is first taken nearly covered by the loam. In that respect it is like a similar mass seen near St. Charles, in Wi nona county, in 1872, but it seems more firm than that. This appears like a firm, very compact rock, consisting of almost pure carbonate of lime, but somewhat colored. It is mainly massive, and striated, or laminated, but shows some crystalline grains. It weathers into undulating, or wavy, smooth surfaces. There is another, much larger mass, weighing many tons, on the land of Mr. Willard, a short distance west. These masses can be burnt into a purely white quicklime of great sLrength. out it cuts more easily than after exposure for a few weeks, a fact which seems to be true of nearly all good building stone. The age and origin of this calcite involves an in teresting problem. When that piece was found in Winona county, in 1872, if was referred, hypothet ically, to the Trenton Green Shales, or to the worn-out Cretaceous that may have covered that country, making it of rock origin, either Lower Si lurian or Mesozoic, but there is much reason to believe these calcite masses are not referable to the rock in situ, but are of atmospheric origin, being, in short, the remains of immense travertine depos its from limy water running down the St. Peter slope from springs that once existed but are now dry. They lie on the slope of the outcropping edge of the St. Peter, just below the Green Shales which shed all the water that works downward through the Upper Trenton limestene; but they are also, so far as discovered, in regions where the Upper Trenton does not now exist, the only re maining portion of the Trenton being that which lies below the Green Shales. - This is strikingly the case near Caledonia, where the Trenton is re duced to mounds and tables, capping the St. Peter sandstone, very far isolated from the main area of the Trenton. To suppose this calcite is due to springs caused by the Green Shales, a common phenomenon now in Fillmore county, is to require the former existence of the Upper Trenton, with a considerable thickness of strata, over all the re gion of Caledonia, and extending far enough north and east to furnish drainage surface sufficient to maintain such springs. This is not inconsistent with the history of geological changes, nor with the lapse of time since the Trenton was elevated to the condition of dry land. The present exist ence of isolated patches of the Lower Trenton, both in Minnesota and Wisconsin, can only be ex plained on the theory that the whole formation was once more largely spread in horizontal strata over STEENGTH OF MINNESOTA BUILDING-STONES. A series of experiments have been carried on by Gen. Q. A. Gilmore, under the direction of Gen. A. A. Humphreys, Chief of Engineers, U. S. A., during several years, on the strength of various bnilding-stones in the United States. The tests that have been made are conducted with great care and precision, and demonstrate the compres sive strength, specific gravity, and ratio of ab sorption, of the stone tested. In the report of the Chief of Engineers for 1875, is a general table giv ing results, and in that table are named the fol lowing building stones from Minnesota: Dark syenite granite from Duluth. Light colored granite from St. Cloud. Pink limestone from Kasota. Light buff limestone from Frontenac. Which compared favorably with specimens from other States. SAND. The St. Peter formation is excavated for mortar sand by Jesse Schofield, section fourteen, Caledo nia, and by John Burns on section twenty-six. This white sand is delivered at Caledonia village for $1.25 per load, or occasionally for $1.50. The St. Croix furnishes a similar sand near Mr. Kline's, section sixteen, Union. These formations will supply a similar sand in any part of the county where they are accessible, the layers in the St. Croix, however, are about 200 feet below the top of the formation. At Mr. Schofield's sand quarry, about a mile west of Caledonia, is a large mass of \"lamellar cal cite,\" lying on the slope of the St. Peter, and"], [287, "PRE-HISTORIC 273 those States, than at present. Then an extension of the Lower Trenton so as to embrace in one sheet of layers these isolated patches, is no more than enough to bring also the Upper Trenton into the region of these calcite masses. The present outlines, shape and position of the areas of the Lower Trenton, demonstrate that they are only the relics of once greater areas which have been eroded and removed slowly, and left as they are because they have been better protected against destructive agents. While Root River has been excavating the gorge in which it runs, 500 feet deep and two miles wide, the Trenton limestone, which at first may have extended as far north-east as to Hokah, has been slowly receding under the operation of denudation and surface drainage. These calcite masses, then, are relics of pre-glacial time, and perhaps of early pre-glacial time, since the last glacial epoch did not operate in Houston county so as to disturb the older surface. known on the upper, loam terrace. They are, as usual, in rude rows, and about three feet high, some of them being four feet. WThen opened they have been found to contain human remains of men of large stature, and it is said that in grading for the railroad, a copper skillet and other trinkets were found at the depth of eighteen feet below the surface. PRE-HISTORIC. Houston county is not particularly rich in evi dences of the existence of races previous to the In dian. The extent of their civilization did not reach to the building of dwellings, or tepees, or struc tures of any material more indestructible than wood; and as they did not mark the met als, except perhaps copper to a limited extent, the relics they left of their presence have long since been resolved into their original elements. At La Crescent there is a chain of mounds which in dicate the existence of a race with characteristics quite distinct from, and unlike the Indians. The conformation of the skulls which have been found reveals them as having more of an animal nature than their exterminators; one striking peculiarity being in the size of the jaws, the lower one espe cially. It is true it was a human jaw and not an animal's, because it had a chin, which no mere an imal has: If it is true, as is asserted by geolo gists, that this continent is older than what is called the \"old world\" itself, there is no limit to the speculation that may be indulged in, as to the races that may have lived and passed away, to give place to another, to also vanish in its turn. In peering into the past our vision is limited to a comtemplation of the great cabinet of the rocks and fossils, and undestroyed works of art, scattered around by ancient races. We have no chronological telescope to assist in ex tending or enlarging the view. That there have been pre-historic races, we all know, because they have left their foot-prints more or less distinct, and that they lived generation after generation, but what manner of people they were, whether they loved most to cultivate the arts of peace, or of war, must forever remain more or less of a mystery. What we do know is that : BRIOK. The loam everywhere is suitable for making brick, which are uniformly red. LIME. The Trenton and the St. Lawrence furnish all the quicklime made in Houston county. There are no extensive manufacturers, but the common pot-kiln is found at a number of- points, by which enough is made to satisfy the local demands. LEAD. It is a common belief at La Crescent, held by Mr. Knapp, Mr. Day and others, that the lead en terprise at Dresbach, mentioned by Dr. Owen in his final report on the geology of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota, was a speculating job, got up for the purpose of creating an excitement and seding land. The reputed discoverers were men from Galena, 111., and the lead found is believed to have been brought from that place. The excitement soon died out, and all operations ceased the same season they began, and have never been revived. Whether this be true or not, the rock, though not the same as that at Galena, is about the same as that in which are the lead mines in Missouri. EARTHWORKS. At La Crescent are a great many so-caded In dian Mounds. Many have been graded away, but a good many still exist. They are on the brow of the drift-terrace, or lower bench, and none are \" The red man came. The roaming hunter tribe?, war-like and fierce. And the mound -builders vanished from the earth.

This is 150 miles north of Du buque, 200 miles southeast of St. Paul, and ready, on coming up the river, the first good landing in Minnesota. It was first occupied as above recorded, in 1849, and in December, 1854, the town site was surveyed, platted, and recorded. The first frame building was put up in 1850. EARLY TIMES. When the name of the county was suggested, it met with such general acceptance that to-day there are a score of men who insist upon it that they individually were the first to present the name. It is admitted that Mr. McSpadden had, before the county was named, resolved to call the city he was founding up the Root River, Houston. And at some informal meeting where the name was under consideration, Job Brown suggested the name of Rice, in honor of his friend H. M. Rice, of St. Paul. But Mr. Brown, in St. Paul, afterwards presented the name of Houston to the authorities. To this, objection was made, and Mr. David House, of Union, suggested Houston, and this at once met the concurrence of Sam. McPhail and others who were present, and it was decided to call it Houston, in honor of Gen. Sam Houston, the hero of San Jacinto, and the first President of the Re public of Texas, and after its annexation, a United States Senator from that State. Mr. McPhail, who had been in Texas himself, used his influence to have the county named as it finady was. In re lation to the pronunciation of the General's name, he pronounced it with the full sound of u, leaving out the sound of o altogether, as though it was Hewston. It may not be improper here to state that General Sam Houston was not one of those fire-eaters so common in the south during his time, but a noble minded, patriotic gentleman. And when the southern people were ripe for secession, and were getting their States out of the Union by legislative enactment, General Houston, who was Governor of Texas at the time, positively refused to call an extra session for the purpose of voting on the question; and so Texas did not go out when the others did, on account of the noble stand taken by the General. La Crescent. It lies on the Mississippi, op posite La Crosse, and was laid out in June, 1856, and about this time there was serious talk about its being a rival of its young Wisconsin neighbor. There are a number of smaller vdlages. Sheldon is nearly in the center of the county. The land was pre-empted by John Brown in 1854. There is also Riceford and Spring Grove. The county is quite well settled with a thriving population, but there is room for many more. EARLY SETTLEMENT. This being the first county in Minnesota reached by way of the Mississippi, the great highway for early travel, it would be naturally settled, after the territory was opened up, without much delay, as the time and expense to reach it would be less than to go up to St. Paul, and besides it was quite con venient to simply cross the river from Wisconsin. Separate streams of emigrants came into the county when it was opened up. Those that landed at Brownsvide on steamers from below, those who landed at Lansing, and those who crossed the river. The date of the first settlements in the county was before the territorial organization, but in this general account it is not proposed to fix the exact date of the first comers in ad the various parts of the county, as these facts wid appear in detad in the separate local township histories. The object here is to give a casual glance at the sahent points, reserving a view of the particulars to assist in making the township or village sketches more complete. There are in the county five principal vd lages: Caledonia, the county seat, was platted in May, 1855, by Samuel McPhail. The growth of the county has been normal, healthy and permanent, with no periods of spas modic accumulation to be followed by seasons of inactivity. Hokah, so-called from the Indian name of Root River, and also an Indian chief who had his"], [289, "EARLY SETTLEMENT. 275 Job Brown was the very van-guard of the army of pioneers so soon to come into the goodly land of Southern Minnesota to possess it. Originally from Michigan, he early made his way west to Ga- lena, Illinois, the largest town in the West at that time. He was a natural adventurer; what he was finally to become, was, in his mind, vague and in- distinct. His love for the bold, the daring, and hazardous, was a passion with him, and when the Mexican war broke out, his passion for adventure carried him to the scene of the conflict. After his return from that campaign, where he obtained the sobriquet of \"Wild Bill,\" he still retained the spirit of unrest, and soon got on board a steam- boat and went up the Mississippi river as far as the mouth of the Chippewa, at the foot of Lake Pepin, where he secured a canoe and quietly floated down the river with a view of securing an eligible town site, on which to build the metropo- lis of the Northwest. What visions of wealth, grandeur, and magnificence must have filled his solitary soul as he silently sailed down the sombre stream ? Reaching La Crosse, he remained a week or two, and then resumed the journey. On reach- ing what was then called the \"Thousand Islands,\" opposite the mouth of Root River, he found a shanty in which were two trappers, one was called Vunk and the other Phillips, a German and an American, the latter having a copper colored na- tive for a wife. In connection with these new- found adventurers, Brown decided to locate his city at the foot of \"Wild Cat Bluff.\" There were, at that time, sound reasons in favor of the location, among them the fact that this was neutral ground, so far as the Northwestern Fur Company was concerned, and no tribute would have to be paid to that monopoly, and besides there was no land- ing place on the west side of the river within thirty or forty miles. And, with Brown, to get an idea in his head was to begin at once to put it in execution, so the roof was taken from the shanty, a raft improvised, and the whole party, with their household goods, floated down to Wild Cat Bluff. A shanty was at once put up, utilizing the raft for this purpose, and thus was the first settlement made in Southern Minnesota, and the \" Star of Empire \" guided so much farther west. It was in June, 1848, and Brown having planted his colony, re turned to Michigan for reinforcements, and to visit his father's family whom he had not seen for twelve years, and who supposed him dead from the war reports. His glowing accounts of Min nesota and the Father of Waters flowing by his prospective city, secured the co-operation of friends, and his brother Charles and his sister's husband, James Hiner, concluded to accompany him on his return. From White Pigeon, Michigan, they started in the fall of the same year, and landing in Milwau- kee, purchased an outfit and supplies for the then untried experiment of making a journey with horses and a wagon across the state of Wisconsin. They had four hired men, \"Jack Miller,\" from Michigan, \"Jerry,\" a Frenchman, and a man who had chorea or St. Vitus's dance, who was called \"Jangulation Bill.\" The other man's appellation is forgotten. They proceeded on the long and tedious journey, passing through where Madison now is, and when near Baraboo mountain, a furious snow storm was encountered, and the wagon had to be abandoned. A sled was built, aud they pushed on up the Lemonweir River, striking across to Black River Falls, with the snow three feet deep. They had an enormous amount of labour to make even the progress of five miles a day, and they had to build as they went. To add to their misfortunes and burdens, Jack Miller cut his foot in a frightful manner, and he became a dead weight on their hands, as they not unfre- quently had to carry him on their backs up the steep hills. Their provisions also ran short, and they had to subsist on parched corn ; and as they reflected on the slow progress they were making, it was feared that this would also fail. After leav- ing Black River Falls, John concluded to strike out alone on foot for LaCrosse, to make arrange- ments for the rest of the party. He had no over- coat, depending upon his rapid walking to keep warm. Toward night he became exhausted, and would set down and rest awhile, then resume his lonesome journey. He finally struck the LaCrosse River and the Mississippi bottoms, but night com- ing on he was afraid to proceed for fear of an in- voluntary ice-cold bath in an air-hole. He was in a desperate condition; there was plenty of grass and material for a fire, but no matches, and so the best he could do was to pull the marsh grass and make a bed between two logs, and there he would lay, until on the point of being benumbed with the cold, he would get up and spin around until warmed up, when he would gracefully retire, to repeat the exercise as the unwelcome frigidity"], [290, "276 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. would again creep over him. In the morning he succeeded in finding the house of \"Scoots Miller,\" whoever he was, and to his dismay found his feet badly frozen, and this disabled him for the winter. The rest of the party finally reached LaCrosse, a woe-begone, cadaverous looking set. But having partaken of the hospitality of John M. Levy, one of the early settlers there, they were so far recu perated that between Christmas and New Year's day they went down to Wild Cat Bluff, but found that the parties that were left to hold the fort had disappeared. Mr. Vunk, who was afflicted with a spirit of chronic restlessness, had moved to pas tures new, while poor Phillips had met a watery grave beneath the turbid billows of the Missis sippi, and surmises were made that the swarthy companion of his cabin assisted in his taking off. and they located a claim on the river north of Brown's place, and purchased a shanty of the Browns. Blair became disabled by sickness, and soon returned to Galena. If Wdd Cat Jack had lived in Baltimore he would have been called a \"plug ugly,\" if in an other locality he would have been called a \"thug,\" or a \"shoulder hitter.\" He was a desperado, who was only happy in the midst of a terrific row, where there was real danger. The sentiment of fear was wanting in his bosom. Logging and rafting was his principal business. Among the river men, the trappers, the Indians, and settlers, it may well be imagined there were some hard cases, but Wild Cat Jack was afraid of none of them. About two acres of his purchase was broken and enclosed by a picket fence, as he was a worker as well as a fighter. Job Brown and Wild Cat Jack were soon fast friends, and they were a couple of hard citizens, who, for prudential reasons, were carefully let alone when muscular exercise was on the alert. As a specimen of their recklessness a story of their foolhardiness wdl be related. One day, after they had just come down the river, both were standing on top of the bluff, when one chal lenged the other for a race down the precipitous decdvity, for one dollar, and down they went at the imminent peril of their lives. Both were powerful men, and it was with the greatest diffi culty that they could keep their feet, but on they rushed, clearing brush eight feet high, and making strides forty feet long, as Brown now solemnly claims; down they flew, and alighting, one on each side of the shanty, met breast to breast in front of their door, making a dead heat. Near this very place, a few years later, a huge boulder became detached, shot down with terrific speed and actually went through a shanty, demolishing a table just set for dinner, crossed the street and roded into the river. At a later time another rock went through a house into the cedar. Looking up that dizzy height it is a matter of profound astonishment that any one should attempt such a feat, and it is equally marvelous that they got down alive. As it was, the new boots that each had on were entirely demolished. The unhewn log residence, improvised for their accommodation, was 12x14 feet, and stood about 300 yards above the stone warehouse just below the upper spring. It was built into the side-hill. Brown and Miller, being cripples, remained in the shanty, while the others went to work for J. M. Levy, chopping wood to keep the \"pot boiling\" in the cabin. Near spring they all came back and commenced cutting steamboat wood. The four men were soon discharged, and the Browns and Hiner continued chopping and log ging, using the timber on the island across the river. During the summer of 1849, Charles Brown took the team back to Baraboo, and brought over the wagon and supplies left there. In 1850, David Brown, who was not related to the Browns already here, came into the settlement, and .bought a few acres from the Browns. This Brown was an eastern man, and had made Job's acquaintance in the Mexican war. He put up a building and did some chopping, but in two years sold out. Mr. Hiner also sold out in 1851, and went toDubuque and worked at his trade awhile, but finally came back to the county and opened a hotel in Caledo nia. The original claim staked out was from the mouth of Wild Cat Creek to the upper spring, and was supposed to go back to \"Sundown.\" Hiner sold his one- third interest in the whole bus ness to Henry Deshner, who yet lives in Wdd Cat valley. The next person to shed the light of his pres ence as a denizen of Wild Cat was William Morri son, who became, on the river, a noted character as \"Wdd Cat Jack.\" Wild him came Willard Blair, Jack's marriage was in keeping with the man, it was a runaway affair, exemplifying the adage that their is no accounting for tastes, as she was a beau tiful, unobtrusive, and modest young woman."], [291, "GENERAL REMARKS. 277 Finallv, Jack, with a Mr. Hastings, went down the river to the mouth of the Bad Ax, and founded that village, vibrating between the two places for a time, but finally selling out his Brownsvdle property to G. R. West, of Dubuque, and it was afterwards made into West's addition. made the condition of things we find possible. At this time the confines of civdization was on the lakes, Chicago had not many thousand people, Mdwaukee was just beginning to be a village, LaCrosse was a mere vedette, as an outpost of civil ization. There was nothing in Minnesota, except the intrinsic merit of the location, to attract peo ple from their more or less comfortable homes in the East, or on the other side of the water. The hope as to the future which \"springs eternal in the human heart\" was what lured them on, and al though those who came were usuady regarded by the friends they left behind as being adventurers, soldiers of fortune, who, if they ever returned at all, would indeed be fortunate. They were a sturdy race, who realized the inequality of the struggle in the old States or countries, and resolved to plant themselves where merit would not be sup pressed by traditions. As might have been expected, this noted char acter came to his death during one of his desperate moods. He had stolen a raft of logs of Peter Cam eron, of LaCrosse, and taken it down the river. He was suspected, and Job Brown informed Cam eron that there were others interested in the piracy. This was told to Jack as if Job had \"squealed\" on him, and Jack came up with a \"pepper-box\" re volver, with five barrels loaded and one empty, evidently intending, after he had dispatched Brown, to pretend that it was an accident, and with this view he blustered around town, snapping the weapon on the empty barrel. Brown attempted to placate the man, but to no purpose, and while seated on his steps, Jack flourished his pistol, and setting it so as to miss fire, as he supposed, placed the muzzle to his own head, and puding the trig ger fell dead on the spot, with a bullet through his brain. It was afterward learned that Charles Brown was inside with a thirteen-inch pistol, with the \"drop\" on Jack if he had made his threatened murderous assault upon his brother. Of course this affair created a great excitement at the time, but it was a matter of congratulation that no one but himself was responsible for his taking off. The men who came were, as a rule, enterprising, openhearted and sympathizing, they were good neighbors, and so good neighborhoods were created, and they idustrated the idea of the brotherhood of man more by example than by quoting creeds. With a bravery that never blanched in the presence of the most appalling danger, they nevertheless were tender, kind, and considerate in the presence of misfortune, and their deficiencies in outward manifestations of piety was more than compensated by their love and re gard for humanity. And if this meed of praise is j ustly due to the men, and it certainly is, what shad be said in com mendation of the heroic women, who braved the -vicissitudes of frontier life, endured the absence of home, friends and old associations, whose tender ties must have wrung ad hearts as they were severed. The devotion which would lead to such a breaking away, to fodow a father, a husband or a son into the trackless waste beyond the Missis sippi, where gloomy apprehensions must have arisen in the mind, is above all praise. The value of the part taken by the noble women who first came to this uninhabited region cannot be over estimated. Although by nature liberal, they prac ticed the most rigid economy, and oftrn at criti cal times preserved order, reclaiming the men from despair during gloomy periods, and their ex ample of industry constantly admonished him to renewed exertion, and the instincts of womanhood constantly encouraged integrity and manhood. GENERAL REMARKS. This, perhaps, somewhat prolix account of those personal matters, has been given to show the dis advantages under which the hardy pioneers pro cured the homes which now seem so comfortable. Whatever of romance adhered to the hardy colo nists was abundantly compensated for by hard work. Contrast the journey of that devoted party through the roadless and bridgeless state of Wis consin to LaCrosse, with a party on a like journey to-day. Instead of weeks of labor and toil, priva tion and suffering, with cold and hunger, a seat is taken in a palace car at noon in Milwaukee, an unexceptional supper is partaken at Fox's in Port age, the passenger retires upon a downy couch, and in the morning awakes to find himself in La- Crosse, having lost only half a day on the journey. We who enjoy these blessings would be less than human if we were not filled with gratitude to these early settlers, who paved the way, and actually"], [292, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 278 As to the effects of frontier life upon those who have secured homes west of the Mississippi, a few observations may not be inappropriate. large preponderance of Norwegians, who usually are Lutherans, and are a good class of citizens, uniting with the native element in ad reasonable efforts to sustain churches and schools. In 1864, the Catholic Church was built in Caledonia, and \u2022 the same year Mr. Charles Brown, of Brownsvide, built a church at his own expense, and freely gave its use to all the Protestant denominations who might desire to occupy it. About the first service in the county must have been in 1852, when a Baptist minister preached in a private house, and although there were no professors of redgion pres- ent, when the hat was passed around each man pres- ent, the number being 18, deposited a silver dol- lar, which probably, as an average, exceeded any collection since taken up in the county. Rev. Mr. Crist, a well-known pioneer Methodist divine, preached in Hokah in 1853. Years ago the Rev. Dr. Bushnell, a noted divine in the East during the last generation, preached a sermon on the barbarous tendencies of civilization in the West, and on this the Reverend gentleman predicated an urgent appeal to Christianity to put forth renewed and strenuous efforts to save the West from a relapse into barbarism. This ten dency was supposed to result from the disruption of social and rehgious ties, the mingling of hetero geneous elements, and the removal of the external restraints, so common, and supposed to be so pa tent in older communities. Dr. Bushnel did not have a sufficiently extended view of the subject, for in looking over the history of the past we find that in a nomadic condition there is never any real progress in refinement. Institutions for the elevation of the race must be planted deep in the soil before they can raise their hands in beauty and majesty toward heaven, and bear fruit for the enlightenment of the nations. The evils of which Dr. Bushnel was so afraid are merely temporary in their character, and will have no lasting impres sion. What actuady happens is this, at first there is an obvious increase of human freedom, but the elements of sed government everywhere largely predominates, and the fusion of the races which is inevitable, will in due time create a composite na tionality, in which the degrading characteristics of each race shall be eliminated, and the admirable qualities of each be developed, producing a na tionality, or a race, as unlike as it must be super ior to those that have preceded it. Even now, be fore the first generation has passed away, society in the West has outgrown the irritation of the transplanting, and there are no more vicious ele ments in society here than in the East, as the criminal statistics wdl abundantly show. Early attention was paid to education, the first schools being sustained by subscription, and kept in log houses used as residences, or in sheds attached, thereto. But as soon as the growing children necessitated school houses, they were laid up by a \"Bee\" of the whole neighborhood, who bringing a few logs apiece, the budding would soon be covered in, and a place for schools, debat ing clubs, rehgious and other meetings, would be provided. Many of these have been replaced with more commodious structures. NAMES OF EARLY SETTLERS.

Abraham Wilson and Sarah Thompson. John Muns and Phebe Cochran. Knud Knudson and Anne Olesdatter. Anthony Huyck, a native of Adegany county New York, came to Houston county when twenty six years of age, in 1852, and located a claim in a rough way, a mile and a half from where Cale donia now is, where John Burns lives. Peter L. Swarthout came with him, and they were a jody pair of bachelors. They had their choice of lands between the Mississippi and any uncertain point west, and selected both timber and prairie to the amount of 320 acres between them. After break ing forty acres Huyck left Swarthout with the claim and went on to Spring Grove. Mr. Huyck lived quite a while alone, doing his own house work, cooking, washing, but probablo no ironing, mending and such domestic work. His early edu cation in the culinary art had been neglected, and it was done under trying circumstances, which, al though sometimes exasperating to a waiting stom ach, were at other times ludicrous in the extreme. One or two instances alone, will be related. Johannes Peterson and Inge Maria Jorgensoat- ter. Helge Halvorsen and Kari Olsdatter. Jonas Svendsen and Mette Christine Jonsdat- ter. Thomas Griffith and Martha Jane McPherson. Simon Nedson and Kari Ericksdatter. Knud Olsen and Bertha Pedersdatter. The last here recorded was solemnized on the 26th of July, 1850. It is not unlikely that many of the names after having been handled by some of the Justices in those primitive times, and tran scribed from their manuscript to the record, to be reproduced here, have been so transformed in their orthography that their parents would not recog nize them now. His first experience in cooking pork and beans was in this wise. He put the beans to soak, and remembering that his mother used always to pour off the \"bean water,\" he carefully drained off the last drop and jammed a piece of pork down into them, put them in the oven, and again mindful that they used to be kept in the oven ad night, kept them there a long time under a hot fire, and when he came to take them out he found a mass of charcoal where the pork was, and the beans were as hard as buck shot. Early Certificates. \u2014 While most of the re corded certificates of marriages, although not in any uniform style, are wed written documents. Some of them, as specimens of of dterary struggles, should not be forgotten. Here is one: \"Memorandom maid this 11th day of may, 1857, by and between John Schminden and Catharine Berket has agreed to get married by the under signed Justice of the Peace, and that said John Schminden is 21 years of age, and also Catharine Berket is over eighteen years old, and said parties has agreed to get married in Presence of the un dersigned Witness, and boath parties has declared that neither of them never was married before. On another occasion he was annoyed by im mense flocks of pigeons that picked up his grain as fast as he could sow it, so he improvised a trap and soon caught quite a number, and after picking and dressing them, a remembrance of pigeon pie came over him, so he roded out some pie crust, and placing an under crust in a pan, cut up and stowed away his pigeons, covering them with an upper crust, and placing the dish in the oven, watched it carefully until it was nicely browned, when he took Witnessed by JOHNANNA FlTZPATRIOK, his John X CharenA. mark. \"I do hereby certdy that I married the above"], [296, "282 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. it out, having invited a friend to dinner with him. On attempting to cut his pie he found the fowls were not even warmed through. The next time he attempted to make a pigeon pie, he cooked the meat before putting between the crusts. give them my note.\" And this story was quite ex tensively believed at the time. The winter of 1857 was a severe one, the snow at one time being nearly three feet deep on a level, with a hard and glassy crust on the top, which would bear up a dog or a wod, and in most places, an ordinary sized man, but the deer, with their sharp and small hoofs, would break through, and thus they fed easy victims to their enemies. They were hunted so remorselessly and successfully that they were wed nigh exterminated in the settled re gion where this condition of the snow existed. One day, after some white women had arrived in Caledonia, three of them rode out to his place in a buggy, and as Anthony had not been expecting company, his mending had been postponed so long that his pantaloons were bursted out at all eligible points, and indeed he was almost in a trowserless condition; as they drove up he stepped behind some hazel brush and tried to look unconcerned, but they requested him to come and hitch the horse; and he, seeing no method of disappearing, made a clean breast of the whole situation, declar ing the utter impossibility of his coming out in his present wardrobe; but on their assurance that his appearance in that condition would not be so remarkably novel to them after all, he came from under cover and attended to them, seldng some vegetables and promising to call upon them in town when he should succeed in making himself a little more presentable. As an example of the sad havoc played with the deer in Houston county, the experience of John Murphy, an early settler of Sheldon, in the Badger valley, will be related. During that glacial period, he, with his son, killed eleven deer with no other weapon than a hickory club, one of the few instances where the shillelah has brought down other than human game. He would start out with his dog, and when a fresh track was discovered he would follow it up to find the deer worried by the dog and flounder ing in the crust broken snow, when it would be dispatched by blows on the head. One day he drove a large stag into Silver Creek, and in his anxiety to interview him with his stick, fell into the water, when there was a marine contest, each fighting for deer life. The man was reinforced by the dog, and to a disinterested spectator the ac quatic sport must have been exhilarating. The odds at first were in favor of the deer, but the young man appearing upon the scene, and reach ing with his hickory club for the vulnerable spot between the homes of the infuriated animal he was soon transformed into venison. Before he was married he became quite a cook and housekeeper, and took a pardonable pride in some of his dinners, and one day Edmund Stev ens and George Littleford happened along while Huyck was at dinner. He invited them to stay and eat some of his griddle cakes, but they de clined with thanks, saying they would go on to George's mother's where they could get a dinner. They were told they could get none there, but they moved along, and Huyck went with them. He told Mrs. Littleford such a circumstantial story as to how much they had eaten at his place, that she believed the story and refused to get up a second meal for them, and thus they were cheated out of a dinner. Some families represent that they killed as many as forty deer that winter. A woman in May vide went some distance to a neighbor's to get some meat. She had a dog along, which, on her return, brought a deer to bay, and the woman suc ceeded in breaking its neck with blows from her frozen leg of venison. She triumphantly snaked it home over the glassy snow. Mr. Huyck selected several claims in eligible places, one after another, getting some ready money and a start in the world by selling his claims with the improvements. One time it was known that he had quite a sum of money in his cabin, and one day some of his friends were rally ing him as to being robbed, enquiring d he was not afraid to stay there alone, \"Oh, no,\" he said, \"it is easy enough to standoff those fellows; the other night two masked men came there and de manded my money or my life, and I told them that I had no money, but if they would come in I would The snow remained on the ground from about the middle of October to the following May, and was, during the deepest period, from four to five feet on the level. It was very difficult getting around with draft animals; the men used snow shoes, and hauled their wood and provisions on handsleds, and thus carried their grists to mid."], [297, "FIRST STEAMBOAT ABOVE ROCK ISLAND. 283 Embrick Hanson, of Spring Grove, invented some snow-shoes for his horse. The animal got ussd to them, and he became the favorite horse of all that region. He was in great demand, as the team, with a dght load, would keep on top of the snow. A light hearse was arranged, and the whole procession on snow-shoes would sadly carry the departed ones to be laid beneath the snow. of the vidage of Caledonia. Candidates were there nominated for county offices. This was just before the first county election. Previous to the county organizations in the Territory, this whole region was called the \" District of Southern Minnesota.\" When the county divisions were made this section fed into Fillmore county, with Chatfield as the county seat, and when Houston was set off, the officers elect had to go to Chatfield to be qualified, as far as the law was concerned. The county seat at first was designated at Brownsvide, and that was the first polling place. When the people came to decide as to the permanent location of the county seat, there were three points ambitious for the honor; Brownsvide, Caledonia, and Houston; but the Caledonian colony raided their reserves and carried off the coveted prize. The contest was quite an earnest one, and the element of ridicule was brought into requisition. The opponents of Brownsville had a cartoon representing a huge boulder from the bluff crashing through a cabin and driving the occupants out. Houston was rep resented by some Caledonian in like manner, as being overflowed with water, drowning everything out, and the Houston people retaliated on Caledo nia by displaying a caricature, representing McPhail coming out of a well, apparently very deep, exclaiming, \" there is no use, water cannot be found here.\" Patrick Fitzpatriok. \u2014 Among the characters who were distinctive in their peculiarities was Pat rick Fitzpatrick, who, in some unheard of way, procured a commission as Justice of the Peace, and, to his credit be it said, he had a good idea of equity, of justice between man and man, and his findings in any case, though in supreme con tempt, not unfrequently, of legal traditions, of common and statute law, were acquiesced in with out a murmur on either side, for the reasons given were often bewildering by their novelty, and were never without plausibility. The originality of his method of administering the oath to a witness was particularly striking, and deserves to be recorded, not only for its intrinsic value, but because at some future time, when a legal commission shall be sim plifying the code, or the methods of pleading, a hint may be taken from the innovations of Patrick Fitzpatrick. But here is the form : \"Mr. Witness, shtand up, hold up yer fisht; duz yez solemnly shwear in the prissence of Samuel McPhad, Esquire, and meself, Patrick Fitzpatrick, Esquire, living three miles south of Caledonia and ownen 200 acres of land, that yez 'id tid the truth, the whole truth, and nothing like the truth. So there yez hev it!\" But there was a general and quiet acquiescence in the result of the struggle, although several at tempts have since been made to remove the county seat, but without avad. In 1856, a trial was in progress one evening be fore the only Patrick Fitzpatrick, at the house of Dennis Kahal, and a party of young men who had Negro minstrelsy on the brain, went round with a banjo, and struck up the refrain, \" The old gray horse he kicked so high, etc.,\" with the chorus \" De hoop de doodle do.\" Dennis was the consta ble, so he came out and exclaimed: \"Gintlemen; I bid ye's disperse, and not be afther disturbin the honorable court, for the Hon. Mr.Bugbee, Esquire, is afther spaking; now if ye's don't disperse and quit, I'll be afther making ye, for I am a limb of the law and so I am.\" CHAPTER XLVI.

The great Mississippi was for a long time the only highway to this region, and it wid be inter esting to read a few reminiscences of the river. Most of the old settlers of the county at least remember the respective names of the boats that brought them up from Galena, or other points down the river. CARTOONS. Probably one of the first political meetings in the county, certainy here, was held in the log house owned by Henry Wdlard, about two miles west The first boat, whose wheels ever dashed in Mis sissippi waters, was built at Pittsburg by Fulton"], [298, "284 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. and Livingston in 1811, launched in March, 1812, and reached New Orleans the following year. Af ter meeting with a variety of fortune, it was finally sunk at Baton Rouge. The first boat which as cended the river above the Rock Island rapids was named the \"Virginia.\" This boat was 118 feet long, and drew six feet of water, or once again as much as the packet boats commonly draw. She made an experimental trip to Fort Snelling, arriv ing at Mendota in May, 1823. This mihtary post was estabhshed in 1819, and the fort completed in 1824. It was named by Gen. Scott in honor of Col. Josiah Snelling, the officer in command, and who succeeded Col. Leavenworth at the post soon after its establishment. Col. Sneding was born in Boston in 1772, and died in 1828. The establish ment of this post led to the gradual settlement of the county adjacent, which, however, did not com mence in earnest untd about 1834. As late as 1846, St. Paul was only a small settlement. Chien, and Dunleith, respectively, were completed, and a great impetus was thereby given to the river traffic. In 1854, the Minnesota Packet Company added three fine new boats to their hne. The same year the Dr. Franklin and Nominee were sunk. In 1856, the Northern Bede and Granite State ap peared, and the Ocean Wave was put on the river about the same time. The same year the Lady Franklin was lost. In 1857, the Minnesota Packet Company brought out five splendid new boats, namely, The Northern Light, Grey Eagle, Key City, Itasca, and Mdwaukee, names which many of the later comers to this county will remem ber. Ad of these boats are now gone, as well as many others which preceded or came after them. In 1858, the Northern line of St. Louis was estab hshed, with a fine array of boats. In 1858, Capt. Davidson established a line between LaCrosse and St. Paul, which afterward expanded into a magnificent array of boats running from points down the river to St. Paul. After the first trip of the \"Virginia,\" one or two boats annually ascended the river to carry sup plies to the post and the traders. In 1844, the number of arrivals had increased to forty-one, and this limited number, in a little more than a dozen years, had expended to over a thousand, so rapidly did the commerce of the upper river increase. At length the little city of St. Paul became the nomi nal head of navigation on the river, and the numer ous settlements and towns that rapidly sprang up along its banks soon gave a marked impetus to business and navigation. After the organization of Minnesota as a Territory a great rush of immi gration commenced, and was continued for sev eral years. The golden days of river navigation and traffic appear to have been the time dating from the close of the war down to 1872. After the latter year the river railroads took most of the passengers, as well. as a large amount of the through freight. In 1870, five new boats were brought out by the Northwestern Union Packet Company, and the Northern Line. (These two companies afterward consolidated under the name of the Keokuk North ern Line. ) The Northwestern, Phil Sheridan, aud Belle of LaCrosse, were put on the river by the former company, and the Lake Superior and Red Wing by the latter. These boats are still in ex istence. The War Eagle, a large Packet, was burnt at LaCrosse in May, 1870. Besides the five new boats mentioned, the Tom Jasper, Alexander Mitched, City of St. Paul, Mdwaukee, Addie Johnson (of the Northwestern line), the Minneap olis, Rock Island, Davenport, Dubuque, Minnesota, Muscatine, and others of the Northern hne, and the Diamond Jo, Ida Fulton, Arkansas, and Tidal Wave, of the Diamond Jo line, were all running on the river, as wed as a host of raft-boats. In 1871, the City of Quincy and S. S. Merrill were put upon the river as new packets. The latter boat, then the largest on the upper river, was burnt at War saw, Id., the year following. In 1872, the Clin ton was put on the river, and since then but few new boats have been built. In 1847, the first regular hne of boats was brought out by the Galena Packet Company, to run between Galena and Mendota. Rival com panies also soon began to put on opposition boats. In those days the Dr. Franklin, Senator, Ben. Campbed, Lady Franklin, and Nominee, were the names of boats famdiar to early comers to the new Territory. In 1849, '50 and '51, the Minnesota Packet Company run a hne of boats up the river twice a week. In 1852, the nearest approach of any line of radroad to the river from toward the East, was the one from Chicago -to Galena, then terminating at Rockford, Id. Between this place and Galena, travelers had to be transferred by stage coach. Between 1854 and 1858, three lines of railroad, terminating at LaCrosse, Prairie du"], [299, "FERRY BOATS ON THE MISSISSIPPI. 285 The subjoined table gives the dates of the open ing of navigation from 1844 to 1855, inclusive. valuable assistance to the emigrants and settlers, it had no regular time-table, and like a train running out of schedule time, was always \" wdd.\" The great bulk of the travel in those days was from the East, and so the Wild Kate used to remain over on that side until somebody desired to come over, when, by the aid of two horses, working tread-mill fashion, it would \"pud for the shore\" on the Min nesota side. This service at that time was very creditable. 1844 April 6. 1845, March 31. 1847 April 7. 1849, April 6. 1850 \" 19. 1851, \" 5. 1852 \" 16. 1853, \" 11. In 1855, Mr. Bates put on a steam ferry-boat known as the \" Honey Eye,\" the settlers nicknamed it Mu-Chick-e- Vous, whatever that means. It was a dangerously dilapidated antiquarian affair, and to give an idea of the craft and its improvements over the horse power of \"Wild Kate,\" it is related with the most solemn asservation as to its truth, that it sometimes happened that while crossing the river they had to tie up to an island, let the steam go down, take off the safety valve, and with buckets fill the boder, then get up steam again and finish the trip. For two years the people had to submit to such ferry accommodations as this boat furnish ed, the only first-class thing connected with the line was the fare, and the cost of transporting freight, there was nothing small about those items. Of course it would be stating it mild to say that the ferry was unpopular. Before the boat was finally abandoned, the Kentucky Company had become the owner, and when it could not be coaxed to at tempt another trip, a new boat was brought from Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and this run up to the spring of 1857, when it was cut down by a field of ice, and sunk, whde tied up at La Crosse. A large boat was then chartered for the summer business, called the \"Jo Gale,\" and at the same time a new boat was ordered at New Albany, which reached here in the fad of 1857. This was the \" McRob erts,\" named as a compliment to Thomas McRoberts, the agent of the company. This boat run twenty one years, or until August, 1878. 1854, \" 8. 1855, \" 17.

FERRIES. Very early in the history of the county, the necessity of a ferry became imperative, and although it was an inter-State institution, the west ern landing being in La Crescent, an account of it will be presented here. For several years, about the time of the war, there was great dissatisfaction with the ferry. The company charged $1.50 each way for passen- A license was granted to O. W. Streeter by the Territorial government on the 3d of March, 1855, to operate a ferry at this point, but it was sold to Cyrus K. Lord, on the 31st of October, the same year. The first regular boat run was by Captain W. G. McSpadden, and it was caded the \" Wild Kate,\" the first part of the name was peculiarly expressive and appropriate, for, whde it was a most gers. An opposition boat, the \"General Pope,\" was put on, and the the fare was fifty cents each way. Freights were so jeduced that a farmer, with 500 bushels of wheat to transport, would save $25. At one time Gen. C. C. Washburn became in terested in the ferry question, and materially as sisted in securing cheaper rates."], [300, "286 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. After the McRoberts, the Warsaw was put on, and still does service, having, when the river was free of ice, kept up its regular trips, making as many as eight round trips a day in the summer. It is understood that the ferry business here is a paying one. In 1877, the McRoberts was sold to J. C. Day, by the Kentucky Company, and it is now jointly owned by J. C. Day, Thomas McRob erts, and P. S. Davidson. very nature of the case, were unprovided for. The hard times, which it was reasonable to suppose would by that time have abated, kept on, by rea son of a change from a depreciated currency basis to that of coin. And so the trouble of raising the money to tie, iron, and equip the road, in the face of internal dissensions, was too formidable to be surmounted, and to abbreviate what might easily be extended into a lengthy narrative, which would not be devoid of interest, it will be merely stated that the work was suspended. Those who had placed their money where they supposed it would do some public good, were doomed to wait around for five years before the puff of the engine would be heard while climbing the grade into Caledonia. RAILROADS. A sketch of the history of the history of the Nar row Gauge Railroad : The construction of several narrow gauge railaoads in the country, and their successful operation, notably that of the Denver & Rio Grande hne, which had so satisfactorily sur mounted so many difficulties, led the most enter prising among the citizens of Caledonia to con sider whether such a road to the Mississippi could not be built with local capital, or at least graded, when it could be mortgaged to procure funds to iron and equip the line. It must not be supposed that all this time there was no exertion made to carry on the work. Mr. Abbotts, once or twice, made arrangements to purchase iron on what he considered favorable terms, but some intervening obstruction prevented the closing of the bargain. Meantime, as more work had been done than there was money in the treasury to pay for, sundry judgments were pro cured, and scored up against the company. Then, to keep the whole business alive, without tending to settle the controversy, or increase the prospects of budding the road, a newspaper controversy sprung upf occupying from one to three columns every week, untd the expenditure of all the ammuni tion on both sides compeded a cessation of hostil ities, and as the smoke of the conflict cleared away there seemed to have been little advantage secured by the wordy contest. Of the character of this newspaper war it is unnecessary to speak, as the parties engaged stid live, and the circumstances under which it took place, have passed away, and \"ad is wed that ends wed\". A careful survey of the situation, of the proba ble cost of the enterprise, and the resources that could be made available, resulted in the action which followed. Early in November, 1873, several pubhc meet ings were held, inspired by Thomas Abbotts, C. A. Coe, N. E. Dorival, W. H. Harries, Weds E. Dun bar, Nicholas Koob and others. On November 28th an organization was effected with the fodow ing board of directors; Thomas Abbotts, A. D. Sprague, C. A. Coe, N. E. Dorival, Richard Les ter, Michael Roster, Wm. Oxford, O. J. Weida, Nicholas Koob, Mons Fladager, and Joseph Vos sen, who subsequently elected the following of ficers: President, Thomas Abbotts; Vice-Presi dent, A. D. Sprague; Treasurer, Nicholas Koob; Attorney, Richard Lester; Secretary, N. E. Dori val. A report as to the workings of the narrow gauge lines having proved satisfactory, it was re solved to build the road with a thirty-six inch width between the rails. EIGHT OF WAY TEANSFEES. The following are the list of those whose land the narrow gauge passes through, and the amount paid for right of way by the C. & M. ahd C. M. & W.: C. A.

To the polls, friends of Caledonia, and give the bonds a boost that will terrify and sdence our enemies.\" but the attorney of the river road, Hon. W. S. Knight, of Dubuque, in an address of great power and apparent candor, satisfied our people, that the interests of our town would be best promoted by voting the bonds. Time only can determine which party to the controversy has the right on its side. If our village improve, our property rise in value, a good wheat market be established, our popula tion increase, our slumbering industries be aroused, and general prosperity take the place of our pres ent business depression, then indeed wdl our vil lage have reason, years hence, in looking back on her action of May 23, 1879, to congratu late herself on the wisdom that controlled her action and that gave us a home market at so trifling an expense. When the proposition, which was finady accept ed, to have Caledonia aid the completion of the road by voting to issue bonds to the amount of $20,000, certain parties in La Crosse proposed to organize a company to construct a road from La Crosse to Omaha via Caledonia, which would be built without asking aid; and this was used as an argument against voting money for a road, when one could be secured for nothing, and the proposi tion was well nigh defeated, as the parties in the rival interest came across, the day before, to influ ence the vote. We must not now wrangle over the result, but advance as one man to promote the interests of the village, and thus make the additional tax, in stead of a burden, a lasting blessing to our peo ple. The road will soon be completed, with cars running between here and Sumner; let us wait patiently and test the result by actual experience, and not decry or too loudly extol in advance, the future results of the undertaking. The Journal, in its next issue, represented in a dispassionate way, the feeling of the community, which time has shown to have been sound and comprehensive, it said: \" The people of this vidage, on last Friday, de cided by a majority of thirty-two, out of a total vote of 185, to issue to the Caledonia and Mississippi railway company, $20,000 in the cor porate bonds of this village, to aid in the con struction of the narrow gauge road from this place to Sumner. For some time prior to the election, it appeared very doubtful which of the two parties \u2014 \"bondsmen\" or \"anti-bonds men,\" would carry off the palm of victory, but the meeting held at the court house, last Thursday night, dispelled all doubt on the subject, and plainly indicated that the heart, if not the head of Caledonia was in favor of voting the aid. Had Messrs. Colman and Paul, of La Crosse, attended the meeting and sat isfied our citizens of the determination of the La Crosse and Omaha company, to build and equip, within a seasonable time, a section of their road to this village, the result would, in my opinion, have been different; but they stayed away, and their ab sence lent color to the charges of the rival com pany, that their assurances were a mere ruse, and were manufactured for the sole purpose of defeat ing or delaying the completion of our home enter prize. It is true, several prominent men from La Crosse, including Col. Clark Thompson, rep resented the La Crosse company and made such promises as they could under the circumstances; We cannot now afford to quarrel with, or censure one another; if harmony prevail, and all quietly, if not cheerfully, accept the situation, we can have nothing to fear; the debt incurred is but trifling in comparison to our ability to pay ; the rate of in terest is smad, and the promise of an abundant harvest and an increased business activity, and improvements in our village, seem to insure us that the majority have not been mistaken. But the majority should not boast too defiantly over their victory. Majorities have been often wrong, and minorities are often right \u2014 time alone can tell; we know that some of the best men in the best men in the village, for honest reasons, voted against the bonds; and we also believe that some parties, who were not actuated by so worthy mo tives, voted the other way. If the La Crosse and Omaha road be built through or near the vd lage, then the minority were right in\" their oppo sition, if not, then the majority have expressed the enlightened judgment of the people.\" \"Like the leaves of the forest when summer is Green, That host from La Crosse, on Thursday was seen.

It was ironed and equipped, and a train en tered the town on the 25th of September, 1879, and after waiting so many years the people were at last gladdened by the sight of the locomotive, and the sound of its welcome whistle.

It seems that, unlike the history of many roads, this line was not mortgaged, and then foreclosed and sold to be bought in by a few individuals to fatten on its misfortunes; but there was an under standing by which those who originally invested in the enterprise should have the bonds voted by the town as a full consideration and value for the franchises of the road. The bonds to run ten years, with an option afterwards up to twenty years. The matter is now entirely settled. The Journal said: \"The long looked for and long wished for event has been realized \u2014 Caledo nia is a railroad town, and Thursday, September 25th, 1879, will long be remembered as the day when the iron horse first made its appearance in our midst. There was nothing unusual transpired over the event, but it was plain to be seen in the faces of our citizens that they were all pleased with it, and were perfectly satisfied. The road wid be pushed on west as rapidly as possible. Three en gines are now on the road, and will be used to transport bridge timbers, iron, ties, etc., along the line, and will keep enough material on hand to keep the men busy.\" Some time, a year or so after the transfer of the road to the Chicago, Clinton, Dubuque & Min nesota Company, that road itself went into the hands of the Great Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company, by which it is still owned and operated; and thus is repeated what is hap pening everywhere, an exemplification of the ancient utterance that \"the big fish eat up the little ones.\" The road is sixty-four and one-half miles long, and cost $375,000, and is said to be one of the best paying branches.

Charters were granted to the Root River Vadey, Southern Minnesota, and Cedar Vadey Radroad Companies in the winter of 1857. \"That the narrow gauge road is going to benefit Caledonia, there is no question. It has already made a good wheat market for us, and soon wid be a good cattle and hog market. Mr. P. A. Pope, the gentleman who has charge of the elevator here, informed us this (Friday) evening, that there were 7,000 bushels of grain already in store; that he had paid as high as ninety cents for A. No. 1 wheat. Woidd we have got this wheat market, had it not been for the railroad? Hardly.\" The land grant was disposed of by the Terri torial Legislature by an act approved May 22nd, 1857. Congress voted 14,325 acres of land to the road, and the State voted 2,388 acres of swamp land, and proceeded to guarantee the bonds to cover the amount, until $2,500,000 was so issued, when, as the companies were supposed to be not acting in good faith, the further issue of bonds was stopped, and the companies, having divided the avails among them, suspended. \"The depot building is neat and tasty. The building proper is 24x52 feet; the office 12x24; the freight room 20x24. The carpenter work was finished last Saturday noon, and Mr. Al. Sherer, the company's csrpenter, can well feel proud over the depot he has left us in Caledonia.\" These were the bonds that were so long in repu diation, and opinion is yet widely divided as to whether, in equity, they ought ever to have been paid. Up to the time of the codapse of the Root River Valley company, considerable grading had been done, but early in the sixties the Southern Minne sota company was reorganized. And so the citizens began to feel that, after all, they were a part of the great world, that they were let out from their imprisonment, and were now free to go and come whenever they pleased \u2014 by paying the regular fare. At a meeting in Riceford, on the 13th of May, 1863, the fodowing officers were elected: T. B. Stoddard, President; Luke Mider, Vice-President; About this time there was a reorganization of the 19"], [304, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 290 Charles D. Sherwood, Secretary ; Edward Thomp son, Richard Chute, and Hiram Walker, Executive Committee. The other Directors were: Parker Paine, A. G. Chatfield, Thomas McRoberts, and Charles H. Lee. In 1864, the Legislature of the State passed a resolution, asking congress for a grant of land to complete the Southern Minnesota Railroad. and Rushford remained the western terminus of the road for nearly two years. In 1866, a machine shop and foundries were built by the radroad company at Hokah, where a good water power was obtained, with twenty-six feet fall, and with commendable energy the com pany commenced to build their own cars, some fine passenger coaches being also constructed here. A further addition was made to the shop in 1870, at the close of which year upward of 300 cars had been built there. The information at hand in relation to this road is somewhat limited, and it is proposed to give only the main features. As already stated, the work was commenced in the last half of the fifties; but the work then done was to little purpose, since the grade never supported either a tie or a rail for nearly eight years afterward, and when the work was finady commenced in earnest by a new com pany, in 1865, several miles of the old grade (now occupied by the line of the river road ) was aban doned, and the vidage of La Crescent was left far to one side. Some bridges were also constructed at the time of first grading the road (1857), over Thompson's Creek at Hokah, and a trestle over the slough east of La Crescent. The original in tention was to have a line started from the river, near the present railroad bridge, thence run across the bottom to the village, and curving around southward, run three miles in that direction to the point of the bluffs at the entrance of Root River valley into that of the Mississippi, and then to fol low its present course toward Hokah. But the new company run the line nearly straight west from a lower point on the river, and the people of La Crescent were greatly disappointed, as the ter minus of the road was several miles away. Efforts were even made to try and compel the company to change the hne, but without success. In 1868, another westward move was under taken. The line was now extended twenty miles further up the valley, to a point where a company of Massachusetts capitadsts were engaged in founding the thriving town of Lanesboro. Here was the western terminus of the road during 1869. About this time an extension of the road was com menced further west, at a point on the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad, located three miles north of Austin. A proper consideration of the future interests of the road would seem to have indicated that the extension ought to have commenced at that town, instead of what is now called Ramsey Junction, but because the people of Austin refused to pay the company a bonus of $100,000, they concluded to leave them to one side, as they had already done, or afterwards did, at La Crescent and Preston. The project was said to have been the building up of a rival town at the junction, but as that failed, mutual injury was the only result. The people of Austin, considering themselves unjustly treated, retaliated to the best of their ability by giving their business patronage to the other due of road. The time will probably come when the present line of the road wid have to be changed nearer to the town. The extension begun at Ramsey Junction was carried westward to Wells, a town created by the railroad forty- two miles from the junction. Prior to laying the track, a large quantity of radroad iron was barged up Root River during high water, and unloaded at convenient points. This was in September, 1866. A great deal of trestle work had to be budt across the Mississippi bottom, so that track -laying did not commence until late in the fall of that year. The track was laid as far up the vadey as Hokah without the use of a construction train. A locomotive and some platform cars were then brought over the river from LaCrosse, and before the close of the year the track was nearly completed to Houston, and in time, to Rushford, thirty miles west from the river. This distance completed the first stage of the line, Lanesboro being fifty miles west from the river, and Ramsey Junction, 185 miles, a gap of fifty five miles remained to be closed up. This was done the next year, the two parts of the road be ing united in one line, October 26, 1870. The same year the road was also extended to Winne bago City, making a complete line 190 mdes west of Grand Crossing. During the spring of 1872, the shops at Hokah were abandoned (except as a repair shop) and re moved to Wells. The company now had seven-"], [305, "STATISTICS. 291 teen locomotives, and more than 300 cars of ad kinds. The locomotives were chiefly wood burn ers, but the great coal fields of Iowa having now been brought within reach, five of them were sold, and the others altered over so as to use coal as fuel. After several years the main shops of the road were again transferred back to Hokah, be cause Wells was too far away from their base of supplies. ber, 33 = ; December, 30 \u00b0 .

Winnebago City remained the western terminus of the road for some time, when forty-three miles more were added to the line, which completed it to Jackson, 216 miles from La Crosse, and about 208 miles from the junction of the Southern Minnesota railroad with the river line. It should be borne in mind that since the construction of the La Crosse bridge, trains on the road now run to that city over parts of two other lines adjacent to the river; Grand Crossing having been abandoned for gen eral use, and the people of La Crescent now have, what they once hoped for, the convenience of west ward bound trains at their own doors, to say noth ing of others that move toward the three other car dinal points. POPULATION. At the census taken in 1860, the first general enumeration after the county was organized, the population was given as 6,645. The State census in 1855 gave 9,788. The United States Court in 1870 returned 14,958. The State census in 1875 showed 16,566. And the last decennial census by the general government placed the county at 16,339, which revealed the exceptional fact that the county has lost in population, within five years, the number of 227. This depreciation is accounted for in several ways, or rather there were several causes for it ; and if the enumeration had been made a year or two before, the loss would have been still more striking. A few years ago the road fell into the hands of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Company, and now it is a part of a great through east and west line. The prospects of a speedy construction of the Caledonia & Mississippi railroad had attracted quite a number of new-comers previous to 1875, but its completion was so long deferred, that many were discouraged, and a change of climate was re solved upon. This loss, however, has been more than made up, and when the next decennial rolls around, the figures representing the population of Houston county wid be swollen sufficient to sat isfy the ordinary vanity of the average resident. THE CHICAGO, CLINTON, DUBUQUE & MINNESOTA. This road, although a valuable one to the coun ty in many respects, is much less of a local line than either of the other two, which have been more fully described. This road has been through a part of the ex perience of most other roads, but it is now in the hands of that great corporation, The Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, and runs along the west bank of the Mississippi, through the towns on the river, and is a part of a great through hne be tween Minneapolis & St. Louis. REAL ESTATE. The number of acres in the county, exclusive of town lots, is 339,934, and the number actually improved is 129,189. The average value of the land per acre, including all improvements, is $8.55. According- to the equalized estimate of the State Board, the whole value of real property in the county is $3,287,465, which is a little over S201 for each man, woman, and child in the county. The total number of acres in the county, after de ducting the estimated water area, is 364,080.

The number of deaths in the county in the year 1879, was 143, making a natural increase of the population of 399. the whole State. In 1880, 14,330 acres were sown. Corn. \u2014 In this cereal 19,342 acres were sown in 1879, yielding 638,233 bushels, at the rate of 32.95 per acre, just one bushel less than that of the State at large. The acreage for 1880 was in creased to 23,308. The greatest number of deaths was in April \u2014 21 \u2014 the next in August \u2014 16 \u2014 December \u2014 15 \u2014 March\u2014 14\u2014 November\u2014 13 \u2014 February\u2014 12.

The average for the State was 24.87 bushels; the acreage sown in 1880 was 3,385. Longevity. \u2014 There are quite a number of cases where persons in the county have hved to be 90 or upwards, and it is rare that there are epidemics or prevailing diseases. Rye. \u2014 There were 482 acres sown in 1879, which returned 7,662 bushels, or 15.93 bushels an acre, a bushel above the State average. But 310 acres were sown in 1880, although the soil is well adapted to its cultivation, and for several years it has commanded a good price. Marriages. \u2014 In the year 1880, there were 97 marriages in the county, and a single divorce. Naturalization. \u2014 The number of persons who took out their first papers in 1880, were, Scandi vavians, 103, Germans, Prussians, Bohemians, Poles, 50; Irish, English, Scotch, and other na tionalities, 5. Buckwheat. \u2014 Of this crop 72 acres were sown in 1879, and 679 bushels harvested, an average yield of 9.43 bushels, which was a fraction below the State average; 43 acres only' were sown in 1880. AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS, Wheat was at one time the great staple pro duced in the county, but on account of its fadure to a great extent, and not unfrequently the low price, attention has been turned more particularly to corn as a remunerative crop. In 1879, the number of acres reported in wheat was 55,820; number of bushels raised, 543,898, being an over age yield of 9.76 bushels per acre, while the aver age for the whole State was 11.30, and in some places an average of 22 bushels to the acre was obtained. The number of acres in wheat in 1880, was 52.617, a small decrease, which was still greater in 1881. Potatoes. \u2014 There were planted in 1879, 761 acres, which produced 74,102 bushels, or 97.37 an acre, the State average being 103.26. In 1880, 849 acres were planted. Beans. \u2014 Of this valuable crop but 32 acres were planted in 1879, but the product was 498 bushels, averaging 15.56 per acre, or more than 4 bushels above the State average. Hay. \u2014 The cultivated hay crop of the county is not an unimportant one. In 1878, there were 8, 770 acres in hay, producing 10,646 tons. In 1879, there were 9,434 acres, yielding 13,022 tons; and 9,698 acres standing in 1880. In 1868, the number of acres sown in wheat was 29,941, producing 521,172 bushels, an average of 17.40 per acre. In 1870, the number of acres in wheat was 36,747, yielding 559,682 bushels, at the rate of 15.23 per acre. In 1871, the crop was 39, 380 acres, furnishing 549,496 bushels, averaging 13.75 per acre. In 1876, the number of acres sown to wheat was 59,003, returning 499, 805, bushels, or only about 8.50 bush els per acre. In 1879, the yield\" was but about 9.75 bushels per acre. These figures show a falling off in the production of wheat in the county and exhibits the reason why attention is turned to better paying crops. Flax Seed. \u2014 This production has begun to be cultivated in the county; in 1878, a single acre was raised, supplying 4 bushels of seed. In 1879, 14 acres were thus sown, with 124 bushels as a re sult, and in 1880, 108 acres were cultivated. Timothy and Clover Seed. \u2014 Several hundred bushels are produced each year. Other Farm Products. \u2014 The total acreage for the county in 1879, was 690. In 1880, 704. Wild Hay. \u2014 The number of tons cured in 1879, was 4,808. Cultivated Acres. \u2014 In 1879, 102,667 acres were cultivated; and in 1880, there were 105,723. Oats. \u2014 Of this crop in 1879, 13,788 acres were sown, yielding 445,855 bushels, or an average of 32.35 per acre, only a little below the average in Apples. \u2014 Number of trees in 1879, 34,610; number actuady bearing, 7,501, producing 4,333"], [307, "AMBER SUGAR CANE. 293 bushels.

Grapes. \u2014 The number of vines in 1879, was 8,222, which produced 22,456 pounds of fruit. In 1880, the number of vines was 8,908. It is a re markable fact that grapes of one or another va riety can be successfully cultivated in every State in the Union. Strawberries. \u2014 In the season of 1878, there were raised of this fruit 3,142 quarts, and in 1879, 6,763 quarts, showing a commendable increase. Without doubt, the cultivation of the early amber cane in the northern States can supply a large part of this demand, and Minnesota could supply the home demand and leave a surplus for exportation. Such a change would certainly lessen the liability for hard times, and if com mercial panics must come, the intervals between their coming would be lengthened, as with this great draft upon us, the difficulties of keeping the balance of trade on our side would be very materially decreased. Tobacco. \u2014 The amount of this leaf produced in 1878, was 2,673 pounds. In 1879, it had in creased to 3,643 pounds. Honey. \u2014 The number of hives in 1878 was 685, producing 6,131 pounds of honey. In 1879, the hives were 401 in number, and the honey se cured, 2,695 pounds. Maple Sugar and Syrup. \u2014 Only about 40 gadons of syrup and 50 pounds of sugar are made each year in the whole county. The great reason, however, why the farmers of Minnesota should make amber cane a part of every crop, is because it is in their pecuniary in terest; if properly cultivated, and the business conducted with the skill usually displayed by the average farmer of the State, it wdl certainly be remunerative. Butter and Cheese. \u2014 In the year 1879, there were in the county 5,359 milch cows, producing 257,747 pounds of butter, and 3,969 pounds of cheese. In 1880, the number of cows reported was 5,494, and there was a single cheese factory in the county. In Louisana, and other sugar making commu nities, the old methods effectually excluded the small farmers from entering into the business at ad, even in a small way, for every planter had to have his own sugar houses, with costly machinery, and expenses of engineer and of operating on a large scale. But even there this system is giving way to the modem idea of a subdivision of labor, and the result is that common mills are being es tablished, with all the facidties for the manufac ture of the juice of the cane for the whole neigh borhood, sothat the planter can cultivate his crop without the trouble and expense of procuring ma chinery and buddings, with skdled labor to work it up. Sheep and Wool. \u2014 The number of sheep kept in the county in 1879, was 3,721, producing 18, 148 pounds of wool. In 1880, the number of sheep was 3,871, and the wool cdp was 18,428 pounds. Horses. \u2014 The number reported in 1879, was 1,084 colts under three years, and 4,429 three years old and over. In 1880, there were, 1,176 colts, and 4,436 horses. Cattle. \u2014 Under two years old, in 1879, 3,936. Total number of cattle of all ages, 12,679. In 1880, the cattle under two years old numbered 3,910, and of ad ages, 12,684.

It is a thoroughly established fact that syrup and sugar can be sucsessfudy made in Minnesota from the early amber cane which grows to perfection in all parts of the State. It is reasonable to bedeve that this indus try is in its earliest infancy, and that at no dis- HISTORY OF THE EARLY AMBER. In 1859, when Minnesota, as a State, was only a year old, at the time when the cultivation of the Chinese sugar cane, Imphee, or Sorghum, as it was caded, was exciting attention throughout the"], [308, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 294 country, Mr. E. Y. Teas, of Indiana, being in Paris, bought a few pounds of the seed, of a well known firm, merely asking for the best. This was taken home and planted in the county where he lived, on a fourth of an acre, and there was a sin gle stalk, unhke the others, which ripened its seed by the time the rest was in bloom. The seed from this exceptional plant was carefully preserved, and the product the next year also ripened earlier than any other. The syrup was found to be far super ior, and on account of the color, it being unhke the dark product of other known varieties, it was called Amber Cane. cane is of no more expense than that of corn, and only a smad additional expense in cultivation may be taken into account. An acre of land will readily produce eleven tons of cane, and a ton of cane wdl give from eighty five to ninety -five gadons of juice by the use of a six-horse power mdl. The juice contains 16 per cent, solid matter, thirteen parts of which are crystallizable sugar, the remaining three parts being invert sugar and organic matter. An acre of cane will safely pro duce from 130 to 150 gadons of syrup of 80 per cent, density. The suckers should be removed to give the main stalk greater vigor. The cane grows from ten to eleven feet tad, and each stalk, stripped and headed, weighs from two to three pounds. A man can with ease cut two acres a day. Two boys, us ing each a common lath, can strip an acre per day. A team can haul it up at the same time. At this time a Mr. Lindley, from North Carolina, seeing the value of the new variety, took home a fine lot of seed. There it was found to flourish, and was subsequently brought back to Wayne county, Indiana, and carefully grown by Mr. Conley, who widely disseminated the seed. It is not known whether this stray seed was an acci dental one from some known variety in the old world, or a new kind just springing into existence; but, at all events, its history, since Mr. Teas had the genius to preserve it, is certainly a happy ex emplification of the survival of the fittest. The cane should be cut before any frost touches it, although a slight frost affecting the leaves only, wid not injure the juice, provided the cane is then promptly cut. The best way to harvest it is to place it in win rows. Let two men start in, taking two rows each; make a winrow in the middle of the four rows, by laying down each hid as it is cut, with the butts in front, and the tops pointing back, laying each hill like shingles on a roof. Keep right on in this way, and you wdl have the cane in a condition to withstand rain and an ordinary early frost. The cane can be cut from the time of the immature to the ripe seed, but the riper it be comes the sweeter the juice. METHOD OF CULTIVATION. Although many of our readers are wed ac quainted with the whole business of making syrup and sugar from the amber cane, from the seed to the moment of leaving the granulating process, yet, for the benefit of those who have not given the subject deserved attention, a few observations wdl be made in this regard. Minnesota soil, by its every appearance, is wed adapted to the raising of any sugar plant. The only question, then, regards the climate, and that is overcome by the introduction of the early am ber cane. The seed should be planted as early as possible, not allowing one day of needless delay. This wid ripen the cane in the latter part of Au gust, before danger of frost. However sdghtly frost, touches the cane, it wid be damaged, espe cially in its crystallizing properties. When you are ready to haul to the mdl, begin at the butt end of the row, and cut off the seed heads, throwing two rows together, then drive be tween the empty rows and load up by taking out both end boards, laying a tier at both ends with the butts outside. Without doubt, in the cultivation and handling of this crop, there wid be many improvements, and new machinery, which, of course, will succeed or be rejected on its merits. When cut, the cane should be piled in sheds for protection, which sheds should be built near the mid. The cane piles should not be more than six feet high, to insure against heating. Space around and between the piles should be left for a free circulation of the air. Small quantities of cane could be covered with straw, always remov ing the straw during the day.

There were seven town sites platted and recorded in the county this year, as follows : Brownsville, Hokah, Houston City, Caledonia, Spring Grove, Watertown, and Manton. Watertown was in Win nebago, and Manton in La Crescent. Lots in Brownsville brought from $100 to $800. The Root River Steamboat Company was or ganized: Ole Knudson, President; C. W. Jenks, Treasurer; and E. A. Goodell, Secretary. The other directors were Job Brown, T. B. Twitford, and Joel March. Near the close of the year 1855, the Brown brothers, at Brownsville, got their saw-mid in operation. THE YEAR 1856. The Mississippi and Missouri Radroad Com pany was incorporated by an act approved March 1st. It was to run from the Mississippi via Wild Cat Valley. A charter sor a ferry company was secured by E. A.

Many occurrences of a local significance, which the readers of this history may be disappointed in not finding under the township headings, may be found here. Of course there are many affairs, which would be quite as interesting as those here mentioned, that are not alluded to, but it is hoped that enough have been caught to give a good idea of hfe in Houston county, since its settlement, a little over thirty years ago. The first circus in the county was at Browns vide, on the 17th of June. H. M. Smith was the proprietor. On the 16th of July, the editor of the \"Minne sota Herald,\" Wm. F. Ross, was married at Wil mington, Indiana, to Miss M. Eliza Rogers. THE YEAR 1854. At the first election in the county, in the spring of 1854, at Brownsville, 126 votes were cast, and at a dance in the evening, hardly a single set of \"dancable\" couples could be got together. Houston county had a total population of 3,000. THE YEAR 1857. The land office was located in Brownsville this The first steamer was built on the Root River."], [311, "INTERESTING EVENTS. 297 THE YEAR 1858. On the 8th of June, Capt. Cady, of the Eighth regiment, was kided while pursuing the Sioux. The first sorghum cane mill was put up in the county by Mr. Andrews in Wild Cat Valley. In 1863, the trout fishing in Union was so fine as to provoke newspaper remark. The Knoblach Brothers started a brewery in 1857 or '58, in Brownsville. In June, there was an election in La Crosse to vote aid in budding railroads and bridges in Minnesota. The proposition was carried to the extent of $15,000. The Root River Valley Radroad was com menced. The first Fair of the County Agricultural So ciety was held. The contract for carrying the mail from Cale donia to LaCrosse, via Hokah, was awarded to Beckett & Wightman, and the service was to be tri-weekly. THE YEAR 1860. Hokah advertised its great advantages for man ufacturing, laying particular stress on its twenty six feet water fall. The expedition against the Indians, under the command of Gen. Sibley, was most remorselessly criticised by the correspondents of the \"Hokah Chief.\" The battles that were reported from head quarters were characterized as \"Battle of Big Thing,\" \"Battle of Couldn't see it,\" \"Battle of No you don't,\" and was sard to be a Don Quixotic expedition of the picnic order. Tn Tuesday, the 14th of March, a Miss Bennett living in the house of D. L. Buell, of Caledonia, was burned to death in consequence of her clothes taking fire. The \"Wdd cat\" and \"Red dog\"' money that af flicted this region, was on the Fulton County Bank, the Bank of Whitefield, and the Planters' and Mechanics' Bank, ad of Georgia. THE YEAR 1864. A land sale was ordered for Southern Minne sota in October, to be held at the several \u2022 land of fices. There wns quite an emigration to Idaho from Houston county. In July, wheat sold in La Crosse at $2.15 per bushel, and gold was then $2.50. In December, Mr. Belden, of Caledonia, began a tri-weekly mail route between that place and La Crosse. In the fall, the irrepressible Col. McPhail organ ized a buffalo hunt, to start from Wood Falls, a day's ride from the hunting ground. THE YEAR 1861. In February, Col. McPhail, snuffing the battle afar off, issued a call from Caledonia to organize a regiment. The school fund for Houston county was $526.49, to be divided among 277 scholars, about fifty cents each. In March, the ferry charter was rescinded by the legislature, and there was great rejoicing. THE YEAR 1865. In March, there was a noted flood on the Root River. Not a single dam, except at Hokah, could resist the frightful invitation to join the tide; the inundation of the vadeys was fears id. The people along that usuady placid stream deemed that de struction's devastating doomsday had come. But when the waters receded, much less mischief than would have been supposed, was found to have been done. THE YEAR 1862. The \"Hokah Chief,\" on the 16th of September, had a graphic account of the Indian war. Hon. Ignatius Donnelly reported the whole number of inhabitants killed and missing to be 382. Early in the sixties, Daniel Watson, of Hous ton, made sorghum syrup. In December, Mr. Lynn and his wife had a runa way accident in Caledonia, and he was kided. On Monday, the 23d of July, a Miss Mattocks was drowned at Hokah. THE YEAR 1863.

The regalia, seal, books and other property be longing to Money Creek Lodge of Good Temp lars was stolen on the evening of the 16th of July. A fatal accident occurred to Mrs. Foster, in Hokah, in December, 1866. While on a visit to a mdl her clothing was caught by a shaft, aud she was carried through a space but eight inches wide; death came to her relief in two hours. Base Ball struck the town of Hokah late in the summer, and a club was organized, called Resolute Base Rad Club of Hokah, with the following officers : President, Ed. Thompson ; Vice President, L. S. Keeler; Secretary and Treasurer, A. P. Coul ter, with a board of directors. THE YEAR 1867. Early in this year an effort was made to estab lish a Unitarian Church in Caledonia. Rev. S. C. Buckley was here preaching the doctrines of that denomination. The subject elicited quite a news paper discussion. In the early fall, Dr. H. B. Laflin took the in itiative in laying sidewalks in Caledonia, by com mencing in front of his place on Kingston street. In the autumn Prof. Julius Emmons opened a select school in Caledonia, which was largely at tended. Late in the winter the Methodists had a pro tracted meeting in Caledania. Wheat sold at Brownsville and Lansing for from $1.50 to $1.90 per bushel. At the Aprd election, the proposition to raise a tax of six mdls on the dollar for the purpose of building a court house, was submitted to the voters of the county, and decided in the negative. In December; a series of meetings were held in Caledonia to influence the enforcement of an ob servance of the sabbath. In March, a huge rock became detached near the top of the bluff in Brownsville, and came thun dering down, and taking a flying leap near a house, went through it from roof to cellar, demolishing a part of the wall of the latter. THE YEAR 1868. On the 5th of January 1868, the Episcopal Church in Caledonia having been completed, service was held in it for the first time. In April, 1867, a fire destroyed a book and no tion store in Brownsville, belonging to J. M. Yarr The Methodist Church bell was placed in posi tion on the 11th of January 1868. On Tuesday, the 2d of April, a Lodge of Good Templars was instituted in Caledonia, with thirty charter members, The Methodist Episcopal Church in Caledonia was dedicated on the 23d of February. The ser mon was preached by Rev. C. Hobart, D. D., J. W. Kelper was Pastor. On Monday evening, May 6th, the saw-mill and cabinet shop in Jefferson, owned by Gumey & Wellington, was entirely consumed by fire. A Band of Hope was organized in Caledonia on the 10th of March, with 20 members. When the income tax was codected the follow ing gentlemen paid a tax of this description in the county: A. McMichael, A. D. Sprague, Henry Rippe, Harvey Bed, Mark Percival, and C. Mont gomery. In the spring the tree business in Caledonia was quite brisk. Among those who were prom inent in planting shade and other trees, were : Dr. H. B. Laflin, D. L. Buell, J. W. Cook, Wells E. Dunbar, Mrs. H. Hinkley, John Dorsh, W. Trask, J. Vossen, J. Bouquet, A. D. Sprague, Dr. O'Connor, Oliver Dunbar, T. J. Dunbar, and J. Belden. In May, the Clerk of the District Court, John Dorsh, issued a license to a man 80 years of age, to marry a woman of 50. A Base Ball Club was organized in Caledonia on the 29th of June, with the fodowing officers: President, C. A. Coe; Vice President, A. H. Belding; Treasurer, N. E. Dorival; Umpire, P. P. Wall; Secretary, E. P. Dorival; Captains, J. Em mons and A. H. Belding. The club met on Sat urday afternoons. July 4th was quite generally celebrated in Houston county, the principal gatherings being at Caledonia, where addresses were made by Rev. N. Fellows and others; also at Riceford and Houston, where appropriate exercises took place. At Rice ford a premature explosion carried away the arms of one man, and an eye and a part of the face of another. Their names were Gilbert and Sherburn. Two children, one belonging to Samuel Baird, and the other to George Spangler, of Winnebago Valley, were kided by the caving in of a bank, On the 8th of May, the \"Free Press\", at Browns ville, appeared for the first time with a patent in- on the 13th of Julv. side."], [313, "INTERESTING EVENTS. 299 brace, and two drids. It seems they had hitched up a horse and buggy belonging to M. M. Wooden, and left it lied up town, ready to carry away thed plunder, and they at once jumped in and drove to La Crescent, where, leaving the team, they crossed the river, and no trace of them was ever found, although parties were out on the various roads in pursuit. They were met several miles out of town by some parties who had been coon hunting, but who of course did not know what they had been doing. The affair created great excitement at the time. THE YEAR 1870. Brownsville had 1,500 inhabitants, with about forty stores, four churches, a printing office, va rious manufacturing establishments, warehouses, boat yards, a theater, and other accessories to a thriving town. A most daring attempt was made on the night of September 10th, to rob the safe in the store of Sprague Brothers & Co. For a few days previous two men had been noticed about town making small purchases, and one of them represented that he was about completing a model for a patent right he was about to send to the patent office. It was afterwards learned that they had made their head quarters in a log cabin not far from town. D. G. Sprague, one of the proprietors, slept in the store in a bed made up each night on the counter, and about midnight, having been asleep, he found himself on his feet with two men making a vig orous assault upon him, which, realizing the sit uation, he resisted as best he could, and succeeded in tearing away from his assadants. Reaching the door, he unlocked and opened it, when he was seized by the codar of his shirt, but he broke away, or rather tore himself out of the only garment he had on, except his stockings, and ran across the street to the hotel where he boarded. Not suc ceeding in effecting an entrance, he headed for his uncle's, A. D. Sprague, shouting as he ran. As he passed the house of Wm. D. Giles, who, it seems, had not yet retired, as he had seen a suspicious man around late in the evening. Mr. Giles rushed out with his gun and fired into the air, which acceler ated young Sprague's movements as well as the departure of the ruffians. When the house was finally opened to the bloody hero of the encounter, his uncle did not recognize him in his sanguinary dress. On examination, five severe scalp wounds were found, which were of a serious character, and, although he recovered, he will always carry the scars, as mementoes of the murderous fray. It was found that the robbers had gained admission through the hardware store adjoining, by applying nippers to the key left in the front door, and then passing through the side door into the store. A dark lantern, lighted, was found, a club and a hat. On the counter in the other store was found a two ounce vial of chloroform, and some oil for lubri cating the bits. In the morning their kit of tools was found under the steps; there were two jim mies, seven skeleton keys, five small wedges, a About this time there was another robbery in Hokah, in the Valley House, which a gang of robbers went through one night, from cellar to garret, and obtained $98 in money. They also were in Caledonia the same night, visiting the Barnes House and procuring $30 from Mr. Barnes' vest, and also going through the boarders. The De Soto House also received a visit. At Mr. Reves his wife heard them in the room and pulled his pants into the bed, thus saving the cash. James Smith's house was also entered, but noth ing of value taken. THE YEAR 1873. In November the first meeting was held to see about building a radroad from Caledonia. The projectors took the name of the Caledonia and Mississippi Railroad. Joseph Till was employed as engineer, and an organization was effected. The number of births and deaths in Houston county during the year ending December 31, were: Births, males, 208; females, 233; total, 441. Deaths, males, 87; females, 73; total, 106. THE YEAR 1874. In April Mr. Thomas Cady, a resident of Cale donia, found a pocket book in the cellar from which the building had been removed: it had contained $50, mostly in greenbacks, which were found in a a disintegrated condition. It had been lost twenty years. Early in June, the work of grading the Cale donia and Mississippi railroad was commenced. On Tuesday, the 9th, a picnic was held in honor of the turning of the first sod, near the house of John Modtor. Dr. Gates was president of the day, A. D. Sprague and Thomas Abbotts headed the procession with spades on their shoulders, winch had been turned as trumps for the railroad game about to begin. Capt. W. H.

The splendid machine shop of the Radroad Company, Fisher's mill, White Bros. mid, Thomp son's mill, the furniture factory, cooper shops, depot, lumber yard and half a dozen or more dweldngs would have been totally destroyed or rendered unfit for use for a longtime, had the dam given way, but the town was spared that dire calam ity by the superhuman efforts of the railroad em ployes and other citizens, who worked hke beavers ad the latter part of the night, in raising the em bankment or dam. It was estimated by good judges that the water in the mdl pond raised about four feet higher than ever known before. DEATH OF LEARY'S CHILD. Mr. Cornelius Leary, who lives a short distance north of Caledonia, lost a little boy aged nine years, under very distressing circumstances. Three of Leary's chddren were coming home from school, ad mounted on the same horse in order to keep dry while crossing the stream. When in the swiftest of the current the horse got beyond his depth, and the boys were thrown off together into the stream. The oldest boy caught one of his brothers and succeeded in dragging him to the bank, but the youngest was borne down by the current into a pde of driftwood, where he became entangled. Mr. Leary hastened to the rescue of the child and succeeded in getting him out of the water after he had been in about fifteen minutes. The chdd was still adve, but soon died from the effects of the exposure in the icy stream. The upper bridge across the pond was moved down stream some three or four rods, and the bridge across the creek near Fisher's shared the same fate. A STRANGE ACCIDENT. Mr. Peter Benson, who lived about two miles north of Houston, was walking along the top of a steep bluff the day after the storm. The water had frozen as fast as it fell on the side of the bluff, making it a smooth sheet of ice from top to bot tom. Mr. Benson lost his footing whde on the verge of the hill, and was precipitated with fearful velocity to the bottom, striking trees, rocks and other obstacles in his course, but was unable to cling to anything and arrest his fad. His skull was fractured in two places, his jaw broken, his leg broken, and he was severely injured in other parts of the body. He lived but a short time af ter the accident. Garrett's lumber became suddenly movable and started for La Crosse, but was rescued before go ing far. His loss was sdght. Root River had by this time become restless and dissatisfied with her narrow channel, and taken to the whole bottom, carrying before it multitudes of drift and cord-wood, and destruction of property. Thompson's dam stood the crucial test admirably, thus putting aside the fears of many who pre dicted that it would be swept away by the oncom ing tide. Reports came from Lanesboro and other places up the track that the river was four or five feet higher than the highest water mark, but these rumors were unredable, as the wire was down and there was no means of getting the news, but the times were just suited for exaggeration, and the opportunity was wed improved. Mr. Nicholas Smith narrowly escaped death by drowning in the Crooked Creek vadey just below Caledonia. He was caught by the rush of water with his team in a deep gulch, where it was im possible to escape on either side. By the efforts of Mr. John Prieve, Smith and the horses were saved, but the wagon went down with the water, and all that was ever seen of it again was a por tion of the wheels, which landed in the driftwood a mile below. In Hokah the damage was not very great, but people were badly frightened for a time. The Southern Minnesota Radroad came in for a good share of damages, and through trains were obliged to suspend business during the week. Pine Creek seems to have taken in a considera ble amount of inflating fluid, and seized the oppor tunity for getting on a \" big bender,\" thereby causing a considerable amount of damage between Hokah and Grand Crossing, and the Howe truss bridge at Cushing's Peak was entirely swept away.

On the 6th of August there was a sudden fall of rain, and what was popularity supposed to be a water spout, burst upon Riceford Creek, and the South Fork of the Root River. In the south part of Yucatan so sudden was the rise, that the water came down in an overwhelming wave from six to ten feet high. It struck the Dedham mill between two and three o'clock in the morning, and that, with the distillery, a store started a short time be fore by Herrick Persons, and a saloon kept by Mr. Carrier, were swept away. Several dwellings were destroyed and considerable stock was drowned. The calamity would have been much greater, so far as life and stock is concerned, but a man on horse back rode as Phil Sheridan rode, giving the alarm. The lower part of the town was not reached until daylight by the impetuous waters, and the stock and human life was thus saved. In all this deluge seventeen persons, according to the local papers, lost their lives. COUNTY MUSICAL ASSOCIATION. Those interested in the formation of a musical society met at the Court-house in Caledonia on Thursday afternoon, September 28th, and effected an organization, with the following officers : Pres ident, Robert Sawyer; Vice Presidents, one from each town; Treasurer, G. C. Turner; Correspond ing Secretary, W. D. Gibson; Recording Secre tary, Fannie E. Dunbar. Executive Committee, M. C. Bunnell, Mrs. F. M. Goodrich, Dr. Castle, Miss Mary Clark, and W. B. Bacon. THE YEAR 1877. The silver wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Fred. Gluck took place on the 7th of February, at their home in Brownsvide. It was an immense time, a reg ular old settlers gathering. The following mail routes in the county were in existence, the railroad system, of course has, in a great measure superced them: In this year there were 24 flour mills in the county, with 68 run of stones, furnishing 124,000 barrels of flour a year.

The outer combination of the safe they burst by the use of powder and the muf fled blows of a heavy sledge-hammer; and after ransacking the papers of the outer compartments, they directed their attention to demolishing the inner combination, wherein the funds of the county were deposited, and no doubt they worked hard, and brought to play all their ingenuity as ama teur cracksmen, to gain ingress, until the approach of day warned them to \"git,\" for every instrument they had used was left as if they had dropped them after using them as long as they dared. At three o'clock Sheriff Hargrave's hired girl got up and commenced washing, and in all probability, the burglars, while loth to leave their unfinished work, thought it prudent to desist, and get away from the early risers of Caledonia. On Monday night, June 3d, a most persistent attempt was made to rob the safe in the County Treasurer's office. Nothing was known of the affair until 7 o'clock on Tuesday morning, when the Auditor, Mr. Trask, went down to the office and was surprised at being able to enter without a key, but he was thunder-struck on get- ting inside to see the condition of things. He immediately notified Sheriff Hargreaves of the sit- uation of affairs, then made hasty strides for Treasurer Russell's residence, and informed that gentleman that the strong-box, over which he was the county's chosen sentinel, had been tampered with. Of course Mr. Russell took two or three steps and a jump or two, and was at his office, and on stepping inside and observing the many tools, not altogether necessary in the County Treasurer's office, he was somewhat bewildered, and did not exactly understand whether he was in his own place of business or in a blacksmith shop. The tools scattered about, such as sledgehammers, chisels, etc., did not strike him as being very ap- propriate for the collection of taxes, giving re- ceipts, etc. However, this sort of feeling didn't linger long with John F., for it was too apparent to him that there was something wrong; and that devils incarnate had broken loose from their Satanic dominions for the purpose of robbing him of the cash he had been so laboriously engaged in codecting, and had so securely hoarded for the people. He soon took in the situation, an im mediately began to inspect things to see to what extent he had been robbed. They cleaned out all the change drawers, etc., and in the aggregate secured about $90, about $75 of it belonging to Auditor Trask, and the balance to Mr. Russed, the county not being out anything except the damage to the safe and vault door. For some time subsequent to the discovery of the deed there was considerable excitement, as it was not definitely known whether the county's money was safe or not, but after many futile at tempts were made to open the inner door of the safe, the services of Mr. Heath and Wash Carr were obtained, and they opened the door in less than an hour, and handed the exultant treasurer all the funds of the county, nearly $22,000. As soon as the robbery had become known, Sheriff Hargreaves dispatched men in all directions, telegraphed to all points, and made every effort possible to capture the thieves, but no clue has ever been obtained. On the previous evening Mr. Russell and his clerk, Mr. George Rippe, had been engaged until 11 o'clock settling up the business of the day, preparatory to the coming settlement, and, as was his custom when retiring, Mr. Russell securely locked the door of \"the safe, _then the heavy iron door of the vault, and finally the outer door of the building. The burglars were evidently on the watch for Mr. Russell's departure, and in all probability effected an entrance shortly afterwards. They burst the outer door open, breaking away a portion of the lock, and afterwards it appears that two of them, and possibly three, commenced work on the inside, while one was stationed on the outside o watch. They then commenced their night's A brutal and cold-blooded murder was com mitted on the 7th of June, between Brownsville and Hokah, by Joseph Marco, the victims being Mr. Joseph Ennis and his wife, who dved on a farm at the place above mentioned. Marco was at work for Ennis, and shot him and his wife through the head and set fire to the house, par tially consuming their bodies. The murderer was soon apprehended and safely lodged in the Cale donia jail. In June there was a four days' session of a"], [318, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 304 musical convention in Hokah, conducted by Prof. H. S. Perkins, of Chicago; Mrs. Mollie S. Tyler assisted as pianist. Hart & Norton, $2,500; Thomas Ryan, $2,000; Dr. McKenna, $200 ; the Journal loss was slight; Mr. O'Brien, $700; N. F. Damron, $1,500; the Good Templars lost $10Q; and others, smad amounts. There was some insurance, but only partially covering the value of the property de stroyed. The glorious 4th was celebrated in Caledonia in the time honored way. S. W. Walker was Chief marshal; E. W. Trask, President of the day; W. M. Bowdish, Chaplain ; Capt. W. H. Harries, Orator ; and Prof. W. D. Belden, Reader. On Monday, October 8th, during a quarrel in the store and saloon of Mr. Shipsted, in Houston, between one Carlson and another named Benson, the latter drew a pistol and struck forcibly on the counter as a menace, when it was discharged, the ball passing through the body of Randall Kane, who died the next day leaving a wife and chdd to mourn his sad end. On the 18th of August, Miss Honorah Mead, in Caledonia, was fatally burned by her clothing taking fire at the house of Mr. Russell. An accident occurred on the Southern Minne sota Radroad east of Hokah, on the 27th of Au gust, caused by a land slide. The fireman, Daniel Gates, was kided\". On July the 11th a new Norwegian Church was dedicated at Spring Grove. It was a Lutheran edifice, and it was said at the time that the church was the finest in southern Minnesota. The serv ices were of an interesting character, and the event a notable one in the vicinity. For the year ending November 30th, the num ber of marriages, divorces, and naturalizations in Houston county, was as follows: Marriages, 87; Divorces, 3; Naturalization \u2014 Norwegians, 25; Germans, 18; Irish, 6; French, 3; others, 2; to tal, 52. On Tuesday, the 28th of August, the citizens of Caledonia voted on the proposition to raise a special tax of $3,000 to sink an artesian well in the vd lage, which was rejected. On Monday night of the 10th of September, the Post-office in Caledonia was entered and robbed of pennies and small charge to the amount of $8. In October, a brakeman named Daniel Vann was kided at Hokah while coupling cars. FIRE IN CALEDONIA. At 2 o'olock on the morning of October 14th, a Are was discovered in the rear portion of E. P. Dorival's store, which was the commencement of what proved to be an extensive conflagration for Caledonia. The building occupied by Hart & Norton, was soon in flames, a budding occupied by Dr. McKenna, and owned by Thomas Ryan, were torn down to stop the spread of the fire in that ddection, which, however, proved unavailing, as the next budding to be lapped up was the Journal budding, occupied above by the photo graph gallery of D. W. Webb. The printing ma terial was removed in front as the fire entered the rear. Early in December, a Reading room was estab lished in Caledonia, and it flourished for a time as a valuable institution. In Sheldon, on the 16th of December, Wdliam Phelps, a young man about seventeen years of age, a son of John Phelps, was fearfully burned by the explosion of a can of powder which blew out one side of the house. THE YEAR 1878. A very singular accident occurred in Caledonia on the 19th of February. A young man named Samuel Watson, employed in the stable of Edis & Drowley, was leading two horses across the street when they suddenly shied apart, and thus strained both his arms, probably rupturing a branch of one of the sub-clarian arteries, producing an internal hemorrhage of which he died thirty-six hours af terwards. Next came the post-office budding, occupied above as a law office by O'Brien, the owner, and his partner Smalley. With the post-office the fire stopped in that ddection. On Main street the fire destroyed E. P. Dori val's old store building, fided with goods, Thomas Ryan's boot and shoe store, and the west wing of Cregan's building. The whole destruc tion was accomplished in less than two hours. In the early summer a driving park was laid out and graded near Caledonia vdlage. In May, the store of Larson & Aslesen, in Brownsvdle, was broken into and $50 worth of goods stolen. Two men asleep in the store were not awakened. The estimated losses were: E. P. Dorival, $4, 000; McCormick Bros., farm machinery, $4,000;"], [319, "INTERESTING EVENTS. 305 George and Eva Maria Schader would long be re membered as one of the most pleasurable events of their lives. The preparations made by the aged couple were extensive and elaborate, as well as liberal. Everything in the line of edibles, sweet meats, viands, etc., were provided, and the slight est wish of the guests was gratified to the fullest extent. One of the happy features of the occasion was the collection together of the numerous rela tives of the venerable couple, who comprised some of the best citizens in the county. GOLDEN WEDDING. One of the most auspicious events in this county for many years, occurred in Brownsvdle on Satur- day, November 2nd, at the residence of Mr. George Schader, the occasion being the celebration of the golden wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Schal ler. Nearly 250 guests were invited from the various towns in the county, with per haps thirty-five or forty from La Crosse, in cluding a brass band and several members of the Leiderkranz Society. In order to comfortably accommodate his numerous guests, Mr. Schadar In December, Mr. John Knock, a German liv ing in the township of Brownsville, was kided by the fall of a large limb of a tree he was attempt ing to fell. His skull was fractured, and he sur vived but a few hours. He was a prosperous farmer and left a family. erected a large addition to his house and made other arrangements which fully accommodated the immense throng, so that on the day of the golden celebration everything was in readiness, and every- thing passed off as smoothly as could have been desired. For the purpose of transporting the La Crosse guests to Brownsville, Capt. Winslow's steamer \"Vigor\" was chartered, and numerous ve- hicles were employed to bring those from to wn to the scene of the celebration: At about five o'clock in the evening, the golden marriage ceremony was performed by Mr. A. Steinlein, City Justice of La Crosse, after which supper was partaken of. After refreshments were served, an able and elo- quent address was delivered by Mr. A. Steinlein, the sentiment of which is said by those present, to have been most beautiful and pathetic, embel- lished as it was with scholarly rhetoric and de- livered with force and feeling. Mr. Steinlein's ad- deress being in German, and as many Americans present desired to more fully understand its senti- ments, Capt. Harries was called upon to render an interpretation, which he did to the great pleas- ure and instruction of those who heard him. After the Captain had finished, Mr. John Ulrich, editor of the La Crosse \"Nord Stern,\" made a few feeling and appropriate remarks, following which the band dis- coursed sweet music, and the Leiderkranz Society sang beautiful and soul stirring songs, This part of the programme being over, the spacious had was cleared and dancing commenced, the first couple leading off being Mr. and Mrs. George Schader, who seemed to enjoy the giddy whirl of the waltz as ardently as they did fifty years ago. Dancing continued until a late hour before the happy com- pany broke up; and when the guests were about to return to their home, it was the universal ex pression of all that the occasion was one of un alloyed pleasure, and that the golden wedding of Joseph Fleishman, of Brownsville, committed suicide in December, by shooting himself through the head with a pistol. Not long before his resi dence was burned, which so depressed his mind, that he thus attempted to escape his troubles; his age was about fifty. Moses Hewitt, a fireman on a freight train, was killed in August, by falling from the train near the west end of the bridge near LaCrescent. \u25a0 A Society, called the Womans' Christian Tem perance Union, was organized in Caledonia, on the 1st, of November, with many leading ladies of the village as officers. THE YEAR 1879, On the 6th of Aprd, while Mr. John Higgins and Mr. Nels Emerson were hunting and fishing on Winnebago Creek, Mr. Higgins shot a duck, and the same ball glanced to the right and fatally shot his companion, Mr. Emerson, in the neck, so that he died two days afterwards. In May, a man named Nicholas Krauss, who lived in Crooked Creek, was found dead in his house where he dved alone; he had probably fal len and instantly expired. He was about seventy four years of age. Died in Caledonia. \u2014 September 25th, Philo Dibble, at the advanced age of 91 years.

A haystack and corn crib were destroyed. met at their house in Caledonia, to celebrate with them the fiftieth anniversary of their wedding day . These occasions are not so common as to be per mitted to go unrecorded. Fifty years is much more than an average lifetime, and what fifty years of wedded life signifies, with all the trials, troubles, and tribulations on the one hand, and the pleasures, pastimes, and poetry of life on the other, only those who have thus traveled side by side, can fully realize. There were a large number of presents in great Variety, and most appropriate for the aged couple. THE YEAR 1880. A Leap Year Party. \u2014 The ladies of Caledonia, desiring to make the most of the quadrennial year, when conventionady they are supposed to have rights extraordinary,on the 4th of February in augurated a leap year party at the Barne3 House. The usual order of male preference in gallanting the ladies was reversed. Ad the details, the or ders, and paying the bills were done in a most charming way by the women, who cer tainly set an admirable example of podte atten tion. All the usual social amusements were in dulged in, and the supper was most elaborate, comprising everything from the most solid and substantial to the daintiest luxury. The festivi ties were kept up with the fullest enjoyment until 3 o'clock A. M., when the ladies took their part ners Home. The success of the party may be judged by the fodowing list of the various com mittees : Another Wedding. \u2014 A notable event in Ho kah on the 26th of October, was the mar riage of James S. Thompson to Miss Emma A. Towne. The bridegroom was one of the first children born in this part of the coun try. His father, Hon. E. Thompson, was living here when his wife, being on a visit to her parents in Portland Prairie, was detained by the unex pected freezing up of the river, and so Jimmie was bom, near the Iowa State line, in the fall of 1852. The assemblage consisted quite largely of old settlers of the county, with personal friends from other places ; among the latter were Mr. and Mrs. E. G. Perkins and Mrs. C. W.

Healy, a young man residing at Houston, and who was making his first trip as freight brake man on the Southern Minnesota division, January 4th, 1882, met with a horrible death between Wy koffand Fountain. He was standing on the gang way between the engine and tender, when the coupling suddenly gave way, separating the two, and precipitating him to the track. He was in some manner caught underneath the tender aud dragged for fudy an hundred rods before the cars could be stopped, as the train was on a down grade at the time of the accident. When extricated, the poor fedow's remains were mutilated beyond rec ognition. THE YEAR 1881. Fire \u2014 At Brownsville, on March 30th, the house of A. L. Darling was burned, entading a loss, of $1,200, which was a total one to him, as an insurance policy had expired, and was to have been renewed the next day. Besides Mr. Darling the following persons were losers by the fire : Ed. Dean, Elmer Davis, James Wilson, Mrs. Henry Whicher, Miss Darling, of Winona, and Mrs. Holmes.

Mr. William F. Dunbar was the first Auditor, serving until January 1st, 1861. In 1859-60, N. E. Dorival was assistant Clerk of the House of Representatives, and the same session, George F. Potter was engrossing Clerk, and there may have been others with some State office. At the constitutional convention, which con vened on the 13th of July, 1857, the members from the eighth district, which included Houston coun ty, were as follows : A. B. Vaughn, C. W.

Several petitions for the laying out of roads were received and laid over for future action. The Clerk was instructed to have a suitable desk made for the Register of Deeds. Two Constables were appointed, one for Brownsville, Matthias Richmond; and one for Caledonia, Thomas H. Parmelee. Tone, H. F. Kohlmier, and Lewis Redding, Rep resentatives. Houston county is in the tenth judicial district, and is associated with Fillmore, Freeborn, and Mower counties. The Judges have been Sherman Page and John Q. Farmer, the last mentioned be ing the present incumbent. THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT. Whde Minnesota was stdl a Territory, in the winter of 1853-54, Houston county was set apart from Fillmore, and the first county election held on the 4th of April, 1854. On the 8th of June, 1854, the Commissioners' court again convened, and the laying out of roads claimed a large share of attention, and indeed the petitions for roads, and the remonstrances against particular ones, occupied a large share of the time of the early county legislature. The county government was at first vested in a board of Commissioners, and a session of this body was dignified by the name of \"court.\" The first commissioners' court to convene in the county was at 2 o'clock P. M., on the 26th of May, 1854, in Brownsville. The commissioners elect were Samuel McPhail, Ole Knudson, and Joseph Love see. An organization was effected by the choice of Samuel McPhail as Chairman, and James A. McCan as Clerk. The first business that claimed the attention of the court was an arrangement of the county into voting precincts. Five of these, which subsequently became towns, had their boun daries duly defined. The first to be named was Brownsvide, with Mathew Alexander, John Mont gomery, and Edward Thompson as Judges of election. Pine Creek was the next named, and elections were to be held at the house of Harvey Gdlett. Francis Diamond, Peter Cameron, and Harvey Gdlett were to be the Judges. Root River came next, with the election to be at the house of Ole Knudson; Joseph Lovesee, Ole Knudson, and John S. Looney, Judges. Spring Grove, at the house of James Smith, who with William H. Roe, and Sebjorn Peterson, should be the Judges. Caledonia, the elections to be held at the house of James Hiner, and Samuel McPhail, Samuel Arm strong, and Edward Stewart were appointed Judges. At this time the first tax was levied, which was one per cent, on all property in the county ; nine mills of this was for county purposes, and one mill for Territorial use. Several important roads were provided at this session. At a session on the 2d of October, an applica tion for a license to sed spirituous liquors was granted to O. N. Thayer, in consideration of $25, paid into the county treasury. The school dis tricts also received attention. Peter Cameron applied for and received a per mit to operate a ferry for $25. per year, and was allowed to charge the same toll that Wm.McConnell charges, whatever that was. The record does not reveal the location of these ferries. October 28. \u2014 At this session of the court, Charles Brown, of Brownsville, comes with an appdcation to have Brownsville entered as a town site, accord ing to the statutes in such cases made and pro vided, which was favorably considered. The court about this time was occupied with roads, schools, and juries, with other details of county organization. 1855. January 2. \u2014 The new board met; James Smith was chairman. Ole Knudson and Samuel Armstrong were the other members, and James A. McCan, Clerk. Assessors' districts were formed at that session, three in number. The first district was made up of Brownsvide and three miles east and west of Caledonia precinct. The second district com prised fifteen miles north and south, and twelve miles east and west, in the southwest corner of the county. The third district comprised Pine Creek and Root River precincts; D. D. Brown, R. L. Young, and George Cannon were appointed as sessors of the first, second and third districts re- in April, 1855, the county seat was located in Caledonia in accordance with the expressed wdl of the legal voters of the county. As a sin gular omission, no mention of the fact of the re moval from Caledonia appears on the minutes of the Commissioner's court, and for that matter the location of Brownsvide is not mentioned, nor Cale donia either, for some time afterwards. In the"], [323, "COUNTY GOVERNMENT. 309 proceedings, however, there comes up a bill by Henry Palmer \"for moving the books and papers belonging to the county.\" The county offices .in Caledonia were first located in that inevitable log cabin of McPhad's, from which so many other things graduated. There was little except rou tine business for this year, the roads claiming the larger share of attention. Adams,and Alexander Batchellor were made a com mittee on rules for the government of the board in the transaction of business; and they afterwards reported a set of twelve, which were duly consid ered and adopted. Mr. L. D. Selfridge appeared and presented a claim to a seat as a member from Brownsville, which, on being referred to a com mittee, the case was investigated, and in due time a report was made disallowing his claim. C. W. Thompson was elected as permanent chairman, and on being duly escorted to the chair made an ap propriate speech. The standing committe was appointed and the clerk was instructed to procure chairs and desks for the members. At the session on the next day, a clerk, E. S. Bugbee was ap pointed; bills were audited, and the Register of Deeds was required to turn over all books and papers in his hands belonging to the board, to the Clerk. A resolution was adopted authorizing the Southern Minnesota Railroad to use any county roads they might desire, provided suitable high ways for public travel were built near them. The sessions of the board were kept up for six days, and a large amount of business was transacted. The pay of the members was fixed at $1.50 per day, which gave those who were in attendance every day, $9.00 for this session. 1856. \u2014 The court this year was made up of the following commissioners: Ole Knudson, Chair man, Samuel Armstrong, and Alexander Batchellor, Money Creek precinct was this year set off. The clerk was requested to secure the government field nbtes for the use of the county surveyor. 1856. \u2014 First meeting of the court on the 5th of January. Samuel Armstrong, Chairman, James C. Day, and Alex. Batchedor; McCan was stdl Clerk. The salary of the district attorney was fixed at $400, for that year. At a meeting on the 6th of July, the privilege was granted to Samuel Felton, of running a ferry at Houston, across the Root River, and the following rates of toll fixed: Two horses and wagon, twenty-five cents; one horse and buggy, fifteen cents; single horse or ox, ten cents; cattle, five cents per head; foot passengers, five cents; sheep or swine, three cents. During the year road petitions were num erous, while remonstrances followed them up very closely. The difficulty of getting roads laid out brought scores of petitions for cartways, which were sharply followed by adverse petitions. And thus was the new system inaugurated, and a mile post in the history of the county auspici ously passed. Some time in the year 1858, the Clerk of the board drops out of sight, and the Auditor, A. V. Pierce, appears as the recorder of the proceed ings. 1858. \u2014 The commissioners this year were Alex. Batchellor, Chairman, Henry I. Fox, and Frederick Gluck. 1859. \u2014 The board was reorganized in January, with C. W. Thompson as Chairman, and A. V. Pierce, Auditor and acting Registrar. Mathew Wilhams was Treasurer. No eventuadties of im portance came to the surface during the year. But it seems that there was not a remarkable amount of vigilance, or at least not sufficient to prevent the state of affairs which the following year de veloped. On the institution of the State Government, the form of county government was changed by an act of the State Legislature, entitled \"An act for township organization\" approved on the 13th of August, 1858. A Board of Supervisors superceded the Commissioners Court. On the 14th of September, at 2 o'clock p. m. The board for Houston county convened, and was called to order by James A. McCan, late County Clerk and Register of Deeds, and the following members an swered to their names : Alonzo Adams, Alexander Batchellor, Charles H. Brown, John Brown, Stephen Bugbee, Daniel Cameron, D. F. Case, C. C. Chase, Frederick Gluck, Robert Kenny, Joseph A. Melvin, William Schminden, and C. W. Thompson. Stephen Bugbee was elected Chair man of the board pro tern. D. F. Case, Alonzo 1860. \u2014 Thomas H. McRoberts was Chairman, and A. V. Pierce, Auditor. The financial condi tion of the county was found to be such, that a special committee was appointed to investigate its affairs in the most thorough way, and to report as to what could and what ought to be done. The outstanding county orders were in the market at from forty to fifty cents on the dodar, and the ex-"], [324, "310 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. amination of the situation created a panic, which was voiced in the following preamble and resolu tions, unanimously adopted by the board at a reg ular meeting in the spring of that year: rumors. The fact that there was a defaulting Treasurer spread over the county, and the country for that matter, on the wings of the wind, and sadly and silently the board got together to see \" Whereas, It is manifest from the report of our special committee, that the financial affairs of the county are rapidly plunging us into the abyss of insolvency, ruin, and disgrace; and it is also equady manifest that the exigency requires sound judgment and fiscal skill to extricate us from our difficulties and dangers; therefore, be it '-What reinforcement they could gain from hope, Or what resolution from despair.\" They were met by a petition from the bondsmen of the absconding fiscal agent of the county de manding an instant investigation of the condition of affairs, that the extent of their liabilities could be ascertained. E. P. Dorival was deputy Treas urer, and rendered every assistance in trying to reach the bottom facts. When the defalcation was established, the board offered a reward of $200 for his apprehension. W. H. Lapham was appointed to fill the vacancy, and he promptly gave bonds in the penal sum of $20,000, and entered upon the dis charge of his duties. After a session of eight days, during which the deficiency in the accounts of the late Treasurer was found to be $3,890, they ad journed. \" Resolved, That the members of this board be instructed to call the attention of their constitu ents to these financial embarrassments, in order, if possible, to elicit from the mass of the popular mind, a remedy which shad be equal to the emerg ency. \"Resolved, That 'in the multitude of counsel ors there is safety,' and that township meetings should be called for the purpose of talking over our affairs and electing delegates to attend a county convention, whose sole business shad be to devise ways and means of escape from the shame ful bankruptcy which is now threatening us with ruin.\" The board again got together on tne 3d of June, and continued the investigation into the condition of the affairs of the Treasury department, until the 7th, when the examination was finally closed. On the 27th of July, the board again convened, and among other things, ordered instant suit to be brought against the late Treasurer and his se curities, to recover the sum of $4,000; also, at the same meeting, a committee consisting of John A. Anderson, L. D. Selfiridge, and Isaac Thompson, was appointed to receive any proposition the bondsmen of Mr. Williams had to make, with a view to a final settlement. Early in July of this year, O. T. Gilman, the County Attorney, moved out of the county, and George F. Potter was ap pointed to fill the vacant position. In September, the attorney was instructed to prosecute all vio lators of the liquor laws. The expense for extra clerk hire to investigate the late Treasurer's ac counts, was $150, and the Treasurer, Mr. W. H. Lapham, was adowed $160 for extra work in the same line. It seems that the county had in its expenditures exceeded its receipts, and the problem, as to the means by which the one should be curtailed and the other increased, did not eventually prove very difficult of solution, as the county finally recovered from the depression, as all communities eventually do. There was, however, another chapter in this episode, which was developed the next year and will be found here recorded. John Dorsch was Chairman of the board the last part of the year. 1861. \u2014 The board assembled on the first of Jan uary, and elected John A. Anderson as Chairman. T. B. Nets was Auditor after March 4th. In March, an examination of the financial condition of the Treasury showed outstanding county orders to the amount of $17,369.37; the amount in the Treasury not appropriated, $3.42. The salary of A. V. Pierce was fixed at $800 for the year ending March 4, 1861, whereupon Mr. Pierce donated $70 for the use of the public schools. A bounty of $3.00 each on wolf scalps was continued. On the 17th of May, 1861, a special meeting of the board was convened, to examine into the condition of the Treasury. The County Treasurer, Mathew Wil liams, had disappeared. The air was heavy with It is claimed by some of the bondsmen that a subsequent examination showed that the loss by Williams was over estimated. The bondsmen of Mathew Widiams, who assumed the duties of his office in January, 1860, were about thirty in num ber, so that the loss, if equally divided, was smad for each one. Since that time the number going as sureties has largely increased, and Mr. Russell,"], [325, "COUNTY GOVERNMENT. 311 who retires in 1882, had a bond, when he qualified, with a string of sureties as long as one of the peti tions John Quincy Adams used to present to con gress for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. tricts, which wdl be aduded to in the military his tory of the county. An election for company officers was ordered for the 24th 'of [December. On account of the limited^notice a few districts faded to elect, but most of them selected a Cap tain and First and Second Lieutenants. Mr. Williams' bondsmen were as fodows: Da vid L. Buell, Embrick Knudson, E. D. Kelly, D. T. Dameron, Mathew McGinnis, John J. Dun bar, John Oleson, Patrick Fitzpatrick, Peter Ol son Quale, D. C. Jefferson. Alexander Stapleton, Henry S. Allen, John Hurley, John Brenner, Wil liam McGinnis, John Murnane, E. Bell, E. Griggs, E. S. Rodins, James H. McDonald, John Stanguin, Knud Nelson, Lars Torgesen, Ole Tor gelson, Anders Nelson, John Nelson, Embrick Nelson, Lars Oleson, and Ole Christiansen. In September, 1863, when the draft was im pending, various parties petitioned the board for exemption from the terrible chance of drawing prizes in that lottery where the blanks were dis tressingly few. They were referred to the military committee, which reported that the board had no authority in the matter, and] the petitioners were permitted to withdraw. In September, 1864, the amount of funds in the Treasury was reported at $14,693.08. In January, 1865, the proper committee reported that there was in the Treasury $3,494 in currency, and three cents in \"specie.\" In March of this year a vault was contracted for. 1862. \u2014 The first meeting of the board was on the 7th of January. John J. Dunbar, Treasurer elect, was required to furnish bonds in the sum of $25,000, but it was afterward changed to $20,000. It appears that Charles H. Eaton, of La Crosse, in 1865, had accumulated a large amount of county orders, which he was pressing for payment through his attorney', who was threatening, if he had not already commenced an action against the county, and the board had considerable trouble in arrang ing the matter, but it was finally adjusted by the payment of $300 in cash on the one side, and an agreement to enter no suit for the balance previ ous to May, 1866. Other parties were compro mised with by partial payments. Liquor licenses were fixed at $50 for spirits and $20 for malt liquors. Instructions were given to the Sheriff, not to allow the Court House, about to be completed, to be used, except for county and religious purposes, at his discretion. The cost of the county government between January 1, 1861, and January 1, 1862, appears, from the Auditor's report, to have been $3,996.60. On the 15th of January the board met in the Court House in Caledonia. In 1866, the liquor licenses were placed at $20. Wm. D. Gibbs sued the county, but withdaew the suit on the offer of a favorable proposition by the board. A new committee was appointed to prosecute the Treasurer case, as the matter was still unset tled, and it was not until December 6th, 1862, that an understanding was arrived at and a final settle ment made. At a meeting of the board on this date, the bondsmen of Mr. Williams were present, aud made a proposition to pay in full satisfaction for all demands by the county, $2,400 in county orders; one-half to be presented within six months, and the other half within a year, and to pay $100 in cash before the 13th of January, 1863, and so this affair was adjusted on a liberal basis on the part of the county officials. Sixteen licenses -were issued in 1877, to sell spirituous liquors. The Court House vault was completed in 1867, at a cost of $500. The Court House was finished in September, 1867. It was a two-story structure, the lower rooms being eleven feet in the clear, and the up per ones twelve feet. The board voted that the building should only be used for county or chari table purposes without the payment of a fee of $10.00. It was not for a considerable time after this that the sureties and county officials finally passed re ceipts and closed the whole business. In the month of December, the county board, in accord ance wdth a legislative act, inspired by the Sioux massacre, divided the County into mditary dis- The years 1868, 1869, and 1870 seem to have been uneventful in the history of the county gov- ernment.

The farm was bought in the fall of 1878, of Mr. Butterfield, for the sum of $2,500. It was placed in charge of Mr. E. J. Evans. The largest num ber of inmates at any one time was thirteen, and the whole number cared for, thirty-five. During this time there have been but two deaths : Nicholas Roland, February 2d, 1878, and Jens Jenson, July 28th, 1879. The burials were in the Freeburg cemetery. 1877. Auditor, E. W.

The commission of Notaries Public in Minnesota extends for two years, and to give lists of the gen- tlemen who have held these commissions since the organization of the county would unruecessarily encumber these pages, so the names of those who are recorded in the District Clerk's office as in com- mission in 1881 will be presented: Edmund Stevens, Winnebago; John H. Smith, Brownsville; James O'Brien, Caledonia; Richard Lester; E. A. Homer, Houston; W. H. Harries, Caledonia; Daniel Cameron, La Crescent; D. L. Buell, Cale- donia; John Aiken, Caledonia; F. N. Goodrich, Houston; Geo. D. Cole, Tosten Johnson, John F. Mullen, John H. Rippe, John F. Potter, David House, and there may be others that were not re- corded. At this term of the court, there were two cases for perjury, and one for selling spirituous liquor to Indians. The perjury cases were in relation to land titles, and thus it seems that the community at that time were certainly a law-abiding one. The next term of the court was held June the 23d, 1856, and only three or four cases were then presented. Michael Burke applied for a certi ficate of citizenship, and the necessary affidavits and witnesses appearing, the certificate was granted. So that this was the first naturalization in the county of Houston. Two others also made successful application for citizenship at that term of the court. The next regular term was on the 20th of Octo ber, 1856, but the chief justice, Widiam H. Welch, not being present, after the grand and petit ju rors were called, and several adjournments, the sheriff adjourned the court sine die. JUDICIAL. The Territorial Court. \u2014 The first term of the United States District Court, Territory of Minnesota, convened in the First judicial district, was at Caledonia, on the 20th of August, 1855. William H. Welch, Chief Justice of the Territory, presided. The fodowing persons were drawn by lot to serve as grand jurors, and severally answered to their names : Thomas Conniff , Harvey Gidett, John Campbell, John Montgomery, Eliakim Laf lin, Embrick Knudson, Edwin Stewart, Henry Burnett, Levi West, Wm. F. Dunbar, Edwin But terfield, James Weitz, Burton Andrews, Ralph L. Young, Ed Baker, John J. Dunbar. On the 14th of September, 1857, another session was begun and holden, the Chief Justice being present, and it seems that quite a respectable docket had accumulated Wdliam L. Gibbs was appointed foreman of the grand jury. Seven regular cases were caded. There appears to have been four regular attor neys present, M. S. Wdkinson, I. I. Moreland, Mr. Flint, and Mr. Dennison. The following persons made application to be admitted as citizens of the United States : Patrick"], [330, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 316 Jennings, Theodore Fish, Nicholas Fish, Lewis Mahler, and Robert McCormick. Brownsville. William Frazier Ross was the edi tor. It was owned by a joint stock company, which was organized the previous April. J. H. McKinney and J. R. Bennett, the land officers, Job Brown, Charles Brown, and E. A. Goodell, were the members. W. F. Ross was employed as editor, and he went to Cincinnati and procured the outfit. In politics the paper was to have been neutral, but at the fall election in 1855, Mr. H. M. Rice was running for Congress, and the land officers being the principal stockholders, and per sonal friends of Mr. Rice, the paper not unnatur ady supported him, but toward the close of the canvass, the editor having been a whig, turned around in favor of the other, candidate. At the end of the first volume the name of Mark Percival was associated as one of the editors. And with the issue of the seventh number, Charles Brown assumed the editorial chair. The paper was published until June 1859, when it suspended. O. T. Gdman was sworn, and admitted to prac tice in this court as attorney and counselor. The next term of court was held on the 1st of Novem ber, 1858. The Hon. Thomas Wilson, District Judge, presiding. Charles A. Coe was appointed foreman of the grand jury. At this session some new attorneys appeared, among them Samuel Mc- Phail, and M. G. Thompson, and also W. Trask, Esqmre Tucker, and J. H. Smith. A case of di vorce was tried at this term, Alexis Durkee against Emily Ann Durkee. A decree was granted, the defendant being in default. At this time, the State being organized, it had become the third judicial district. The court re mained in session four days. In 1859, the term of the court began on the 16th of May, Hon. Thomas Wilson presiding. On the empaneling of the jury, Edward Mackin tire was appointed foreman. Several cases were tried, and several dismissed. A considerable part of the record is made up of evidence in relation to naturalization cases. The Free Press. \u2014 On the 15th of Decem ber, 1865, Charles Brown, solitary and alone start ed the Free Press, and run it with credit to him self and honor to the town up to May 21, 1869, Volume 4, No. 21, when its subscription list was transferred to The Judges of the District Court from the Ter ritorial days to the present time have been, Wm. H. Welch, N. M. Donaldson, Thomas Wdson, David Barber, C. N. Waterman, Judge Mitchell held a special term, Sherman Page; H. R. Brill presided at the May term in 1878, and John Q. Farmer is the present official. The Western Progress. \u2014 A newspaper with a decided literary turn, pubdshed by Mrs. Bella French and Richard O. Thomas. This was a neat, well printed sheet, that worked hard in the interest of Brownsville and Southern Minnesota. In April, 1870, Mr. Thomas with drew and went to La Crosse, and the next month, a more promising field having opened in Spring Valley, Fillmore county, the whole estabhshment was removed there. The Clerks of the District Court since its organ ization have been James A. McCan from 1855 to 1856; James J. Belden, from 1856 to 1866; John Dorsch, from 1866 to 1870; Joseph Vossen, from 1870 to 1878; G. J. Lomen, from 1878, his term ex pires in 1886. The judicial districts of Minnesota embrace several counties, with a clerk in each county. Mrs. French afterwards published a magazine \"The Busy West,\" in St. Paul, and subsequently did some excellent historical work in Wisconsin. She is now a resident of Austin, Texas, and the editor of the \"American Sketch Book,\" a pioneer magazine of the \" Lone Star \" State. POST-OFFICES IN THE COUNTY. There are eighteen post-offices in Houston county, as follows: The La Crescent Banner. \u2014 While this vidage was on the flood tide of prosperity, a ne wspaper was started caded the \"La Crescent Banner,\" but it was hung on the outer walls for only a limited time. The pubhsher was A. P. Swinford, and the office was in the old double store of the Kentucky company. It was a six column folio, issued from a small press, and a not very well furnished office. In a short timo the whole concern was removed to Black Hammer, Brownsvide, Caledonia, Eitzen, Freeburgh, Houston, Hokah, La Crescent, New house, Money Creek, Mound Prairie, Riceford, Sheldon, Reno, Spring Grove, Wilmington, Win nebago Valley, Yucatan.

The Southern Minnesota Herald. \u2014 Num ber one, volume one, was dated June 23d, 1865, at"], [331, "PUBLICATIONS. 317 La' Crosse, Mr. Swinford going into business with Brick Pomeroy. when it was sold to H. D. Smadey & Co., who con tinued the publication up to the 4th of November, 1880, when H. D. Smadey withdrew, leaving it in the hands of P. J. Smadey, who is now the editor and proprietor. In politics it is an independent republican. It has a circulation of 540 in the county, and of 600 ad told. It is a seven column folio, and is printed and conducted in such a man ner as to be a credit to the vdlage and county. The Houston County Journal. \u2014 It first came to light in November, 1865. The editors and proprietors were James G. McGrew and P. P, Wall, who issued it until the 1st of May, 1866. The La Crescent Plaindealer. \u2014 The next candidate for public favor, which also proved to be a victim for sacrifice on the altar of public spirited devotion, was the \"La Crescent Plaindealer.\" This newspaper bantling was ushered into a cold and unsympathizing world in 1860, by E. H. Purdy, of Minneapolis. It was a well edited and strongly democratic sheet, a seven column folio. In about two years it was sold to J. T. Ferguson, and was finally closed out in September, 1862, the editor having enlisted. This paper did one remarkable good piece of work, in teaching George B. Win slip, the editor of the \"Grand Forks Herald,\" the printing business. The paper was then purchased by the Journal Printing Company, composed of the fodowing persons: John Craig, Thomas Abbotts, James Smith, George T. Patten, A. D. Sprague, C. A. Coe, Eugene P. Dorival, and J. W. Cook. On December 4th, 1866, the names of Smith and Wall were run up as editors. The Hokah Chief. \u2014 This paper was star ted in 1856 or '57, but no files have been found. After a time it was suspended, but on the 26th of April, 1859, it was revived by Mr. H. Ostrander, a practical printer from New York State, who was, in early life, associated with Thurlow Weed, who is the almost solitary re maining link betwen the journalism that fought for Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams, and that of to-day. A. F. Booth took change as editor on the 18th of November, 1873. In February, 1878, it was sold by Mr. Booth to O. E. Comstock. On August 3d, 1881, Mr. J. Ostrander came in the firm, and it is now published under the firm name of Comstock & Ostrander. It is a republi can sheet, is conducted on high toned principles, and is a reliable journal, managed by practical and thorough business men. Mr. Ostrander was a most indomitable worker, and while he stood at the case and set more mat ter every week than now is set up in most country offices, he wielded a battle ax for what he consid ered the right, that became a terror to his enemies. He was not a man of policy or compromise, but seeing anything wrong, he cut and slashed away at it, regardless of its connections or associations. The paper was Republican, and in those trying times, he battled nobly for the Union. Several other papers, the \"Hokah Herald\" and the \"Hokah Blade\" among them, have had brief careers in the county, but they soon died of dis ease incident to young newspapers. MAPS, ATLASES, AND PLAT BOOKS. In 1855, Mr. H. Halstein deposited with the County Clerk a copy of a Sectional Map of south ern Minnesota from the U. S. survey. On the 23d of May, 1865, the paper was discon tinued for want of support and patronage. The Caledonia Courier. \u2014 This newspaper was started in Caledonia, on the 8th of April, 1877, by George B. Winship, and was a seven column folio, published at $2.00 a year, and was a really good paper, well edited and well printed. After a little more than two years, Mr. Winship having grown restive under the restricted conditions of his field of labor, he went to Dakota and began the publi cation of the \"Grand Forks Herald, a first class daily. An Illustrated Historical Atlas of the state of Minnesota, profusely dlustrated, was published in Chicago, and quite extensively circulated in Hous ton county. It made a large book with pages 14J by 17J, and was filled with maps of local and general interesl, together with numerous views and portraits of large numbers of its patrons, and brief sketches of local history. The price was $15.00, and it was sold by subscription, A. T. An dreas being the pubdsher. Houston County Argus. \u2014 This paper was started on the 28th of August, 1879, by E. S.

Until 1876 the Superintendent was appointed by the Board of County Commissioners, but in this year, in common with six other counties, the office was made elective. Agricultural Societies. \u2014 There have been several agricultural societies in the county, but for various reasons, the people have not heartily en tered into the project. Several fairs have been held with good success. The County Superintendents have been Rev. James Frothingham, D. P. Temple, Capt. W. H. Harries, Dr. J. B. Le Blond, and D. C. Cameron. In January, 1876, Prof. W. D. Belden was ap pointed by the Commissioners, but it was ruled that the then incumbent should hold, under the new law, untd his successor was elected and qualified. In 1867, the leading officers of the society were : D. L. Buell, President; Isaac Thompson, Vice- President ; N. E. Dorival, Secretary ; D. N. Gates, Treasurer. This society having collapsed late in the seventies, another was organized and officered as follows : President\u2014 D. L. Buell. Vice-President \u2014 Geo. Mitchell. Secretary \u2014 Wells E.

As succeeding districts were organized, by taking territory from those already in existence, they were numbered successively until now the number is ninety-six, containing one hundred and nine school-rooms. But Hokah and Brownsville graded schools, with four departments each, hold session in but three of their school-rooms, thus making one hundred and seven school-rooms in which school is held. District No. thirty, Browns vide, is a special district; Nos. twelve, Hokah, and forty-two, Caledonia, are independent. The latter two were created independent to secure im munity from the text-book law. The vidages of Hokah and Brownsville have school houses containing four departments each. These are well furnished, and more than adequate for their present wants. The one at Brownsvdle is the most costly and complete in the county. La Crescent, Houston, Spring Grove, Caledonia, and Money Creek, have each a school house con taining two rooms. The finest of these is the one at Money Creek, the worst one is at Caledonia. Caledonia has far outgrown her school house, and two departments are located in a rented building; but many improvements may be expected fr.om the present liberal board. The experiment of a female teacher at the head of her schools has proved a success; certainly she is an improvement upon her immediate successors. The schools of Houston county remained in the same condition which they enjoyed under the Ter ritorial organization, until 1859. During that winter, an act of the Legislature resolved each township into a school district, each district or ganizing as many sub-districts as was deemed necessary. The fodowing winter, this law was re pealed, and the present organization adopted. Of these ninety-six school houses, sixty -eight are frame, three brick, five stone, and twenty log. The prairie towns, as a rule, contain the best school houses, whde the log houses are found in the valleys and upon the ridges. Four new and substantial frame houses were built last year. But seven of these districts are in *The following sketch is by D. C. Cameron, County Su perintendent."], [333, "W.Ui NOTES. 319 debt, notwithstanding several successive failures of crops in some parts of the county. out, in April, 1861, Minnesota was but three years old as a State, and had but two congressional dis tricts. Houston county was in the first, and it in cluded the following counties: Houston, Fidmore, Mower, Freeborn, Faribault, Martin, Winona, Olmsted, Brown, Steele, Waseca, Blue Earth, Rice, Le Sueur, Nicollet, Scott, Sibley, and Dodge. The several calls by the President for troops were ap portioned between these two districts. Thirty-one districts have wall maps, eleven reading charts, twenty-two have globes, seventeen have dictionaries, and seven have bells. Caledo nia has the largest enrollment; two districts vie for the honor of the least. About forty districts hold no summer school. The enrollment is not as great as in former years; the decrease is principally in the village schools. The scenes which were presented ad over the North, as the call to arms was flashed to every town and hamlet, were duplicated here, and the facidty with which men changed the implements of the mechanic and of husbandry for the instruments of death, was indeed remarkable. The response here wid bear favorable comparison with other communities similarly situated. In the account here presented, it is not claimed that all the inci dents which took place, or even, perhaps, the most interesting among them, will be related, but the attempt will be made to rescue from obdvion the salient points of the local struggle for the preser vation of the Union. Two thirds of an allotted generation has already passed since the heat of that struggle was extant in the land, and many things which an earlier historian might have found fresh in the public memory, have already grown dim in the average recollection. The total number enrolled in the schools for the year ending August 31, 1881, was 4,205. The average length of schools was nearly five months. The value of schoolhouses is $572,329. Paid out for teachers' wages, $15,049. In addition to the above showing, twenty-four parochial schools were in session, with an enrollment of 360. One hundred and nineteen teachers were licensed during the year. Of these, six hold first grade certificates; eighty-five, second grade, and twenty eight, third grade certificates. Eighteen of these teachers have attended a Normal School, five have graduated. One certificate has been revoked. As a body, a progressive spirit pervades the teachers, and they will compare favorably with any body of teachers in the State. Institutes are held each year, the instructors be ing furnished by the State. County institutes of one week are held at different times. In February, 1861, while the southern States were endeavoring to carry out their programme of peaceable secession, Col. Samuel McPhail issued a call in Caledonia for the organization of a regi ment. The Colonel had lived in the South; he ap preciated the temper of the fire-eaters, and knew that if resisted they would fight. During school months, each Saturday in some part of the county, a teachers' meeting is held, the exercises of which are conducted on institute plans. These are a powerful educational factor and have been the means of developing many young teach ers, and helping many older ones on to a higher plane. The superintendent makes it a rule to be present at these meetings. The straggles of the friends of popular education to inaugurate and maintain schools would furnish many an in teresting chapter. The first war meeting recorded in the county, was held in the town of Houston, on tne 28th of April, 1861. The meeting was addressed by Messrs. Kennedy, McSpadden, Pidge, Scott, and others. Resolutions were passed affirming the in dissolubdity of the Union. Much earnest feeling was manifested, and $255 in currency and $25 in gold and seventy bushels of wheat were subscribed to assist in raising a company, and thus was the Union ball set in motion. Matters of interest relating to particular schools will be treated in connection with the town or vil lage where they are situated, as matters of local rather than general interest. On the 30th, two days afterwards, another rous ing meeting was held. George W. Babcock was President, and Nathan Vance, Secretary. The committee on resolutions consisted of Rev. Ed. Wright, Hon. D. C. Case, and Hon. H. E. Ken nedy. Dr. Wdson and others addressed the assem- CHAPTER XLIX. HOUSTON COUNTY IN THE WAR OF THE REBELLION NAMES OF SOLDIERS WHO PARTICIPATED.

This is an example of what was done in other places. quota, but it was afterwards stated that some of this sum was never paid. In May, 1863, Charles H. Lee was appointed provost marshal for this congressional district, and D. L. Clements, of Hokah, as enrolling clerk. In June of the same year there were several mus ters of recruits in Hokah, where about 100 men at a time would be drdled by Lieutenant W. F. Webber. In May, 1861, avigdance committee was formed in the county, to put the categorical question to the editor of the \"Plain Dealer\" in La Crosse, as to which side of the contest he was on ? On the 13th of May, a war meeting was held in Wilmington. Among the speakers were Winfield Scott, David Temple, and Duty S. Paine. In September, the patriotic ladies of La Cres cent organized a Soldiers' Aid Society, as indeed was done in several other places in the county. Mrs. J. T. Foster was President; Mrs. M. Beards lee, Vice-President; Mrs. Wm. Merrick, Treasurer; and Mrs. W. H. Lapham, Secretary, with a score of the other prominent ladies of the place as active members. The first company formed in Caledonia was officered as follows: W. G. McSpadden, Captain; E. H. Kennedy, First Lieutenant; and Thomas Conniff, Second Lieutenant. This is supposed to have been the first company in the county. In September, Winfield Scott addressed a war meeting in Hokah, and in November John M. Thompson opened a recruiting office at the same place. Untd August, 1862, there had been en listments from all parts of the county in Minne sota, Wisconsin and other State regiments. The impending draft in Minnesota, in the fall of 1863, was postponed to January 4, 1864. So many men from this county were enhsted in Wis consin regiments, that early in January, 1864, David House, of Hokah, was sent to Madison to secure credits for them, as without these the county would have to furnish more than its share of the calls for so many hundred thousand more. In this month a mass meeting was called at the county seat, to help secure our part of the 300,000 more, called for by Mr. Lincoln. On Saturday, the 6th of February, 1864, the citizens of Spring Grove extended their hospitalities, and gave a complimentary din ner to the veterans who were on a re-enlistment furlough. Among the veterans present were Ser geant F. H. Brown, Ole Oleson, and John Amund son, of Spring Grove ; Mathew Halverson, of Wil mington; Jesse and Smith Phillips, of Hokah; Sergt. James Tom, of Caledonia, and one hundred citizens. They met at the store of Mons Fladager, and with music marched to the Ridge House, where the dinner, the toasts, the cheers for the flag of the Union, for Grant, and for the soldiers, were hugely enjoyed. The address of welcome was by J. G. Prentiss, Esq., and speeches were made by Messrs. Rollins, Aiken, and others. As an idea of the number already in the field from the county, it was stated that there were at this time, nineteen from Union and thirty-one from Hokah. At the time of the Indian massacre, Capt. Geo. W. Webber raised a company of Mounted Rang ers, to act against the Indians and in that cam paign Houston county had twenty commissioned officers. The total enlistments up to October 1st, 1862, were reported at 333, and besides these there were enroded as fit for duty 1,549. In December, 1862, the county was divided into fifteen military districts. The town lines were the boundaries of these districts, except Hokah and Union, which formed one of them, and Jefferson and Crooked Creek were also together. The impending draft, that terrible with its red jaws of destruction, ready to swadow up fathers, husbands, brothers, and sons, was again postponed to the 10th of March, 1864. Orders for an election of company officers were given to take place on a given day, but some of the districts, on account of insufficient notice, failed to respond. This was a State measure, but was not a phenomenal success. The county officials as a rale, left the towns to manage military matters. A list of most of the Houston county men who enlisted in Wisconsin regiments-was obtained, and they will appear in the proper place. There was much anxiety in relation to the draft, and the ever enterprising Col.

The second draft ordered for Houston county called for 108 men. When the ominious 10th of March arrived the draft was indefinitely postponed, but on the 14th of that month, in addition to the February call for 500,000 men, 200,000 more were required, and this On the 18th of July, 1864, President Lincoln called for 500,000 more troops. created quite a flutter. On the 10th of August there was a war meet ing in Hokah, to see what measures could be taken to fid the quota, and thus avoid the draft. The quota for the whole state of Minnesota for the draft of July,1864, was 5,561, and the first district was 2,768. The account with the general government in the quota business at that time stood about as fol- lows in Houston county : The quota was 687; men aheady enlisted, 319; leaving a balance of 369 due the government on previous calls. The new call added 234 more, making a grand total of 602 men to be enlisted, Minnesota passed a law adowing soldiers in the field to vote, and commissioners were sent out to receive and bring home the returns, but out of the hundreds from this county who went to the front, not over fifty votes were received. and to do this, only twenty days were allowed. It may well be imagined that when the full force of the situation dawned upon those who were so much more anxious to fid the quota than to re cruit our armies, that there was a subdued kind of consternation, and town meetings were called and bounties voted with the feeblest kind of opposi- In September, 1864, W.

Unquestionably, the names of Union soldiers here presented will create a more lively interest as time goes on, and, as one by one they are called to enlist in an army, in relation to the tactics of which so little is known, the institutions they have helped to preserve will be more affectionately cherished by the remaining few.

The sod is a dark loam, mixed with clay, and capable of producing wheat and the other cereals. The sides of the bluffs are more or less covered with timber of different varieties, such as oak, elm, and basswood, with an occasional red cedar cling ing to a crevice in the rocks. The eastern and northeastern part of the town is also bluffy or broken, and covered with timber, which is largely owned by the farmers of Caledonia, in ten and twenty acre lots, from which they procure fencing and fuel. This town was originady included in the town ships of Spring Grove and Yucatan, and was or ganized as a separate town in April, 1859, the first town meeting being held at that time. It lies on the western boundary of the county; is bounded on the north by Yucatan, and on the south by Spring Grove, and contains an area of 23,040 acres, being a fud government township. It is estimated that about one-fourth of the whole area of the township is unsuitable for culti vation by present processes and for present crops, but is useful for grazing and to raise timber. The surface in the southern part is generally roding prairie, interspersed, here and there, with little groves of young timber. Riceford Creek enters the town in section thirty-one, and winds its tortuous course in a northerly direction, to finally leave the town between sections four and five. Along this stream the surface is more broken, with bluffs that extend up from 350 to 400 feet above the surface of the water below. Here, on the top of these hills, are level ranges, with a growth of brush and small oak timber, and this, when re- Beaver Creek makes its way through a portion of the eastern part of the town. The bottoms along these creeks are covered with good varieties of indigenous grasses, which supply hay or grazing for stock. Pre-Historic. \u2014 The appearances in the north part of the township indicate that this region was at one time the favorite rendezvous of a race that antedates our American chronology. Near Riceford Creek are the remains of what"], [340, "326 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. might have been fortifications, or for some other use. They have been plowed over, and other eroding processes have been at work, and now some of them are wed nigh obliterated. Still traces of them are visible near the residences of Wdliam and Peter Carrier. There is also, in this vicinity, a cave, or cavern, that may have been formed or modified by human hands. It has an entrance not undke a door, four feet square, and extends a thousand feet or so, varying in height from five to six feet. Not long ago a gold coin was found in this cavern by Peter C. Carrier, a son of Wm. Carrier, who disposed of it to Mr. James Vincent, of Houston village. It was about the size of a $5.00 piece, and bore no intelligible in scription. ten acres, which marked the beginning of agricul ture in the town. He afterwards planted an or chard and gathered the first crop of apples ever raised in this section. In June, 1853, several other families followed; among them were Knud Olsen Ike, with his three sons, Knud, John, and Ole; Mr. Guttorms and Jens Olsen Ottemess, the two last mentioned be ing stid living on their original claims. Lars G. Findreng came in 1854, and cast his lot on section twenty-one. His son, Ole T., hved with his parents up to the time of his father's death in 1873, and he now occupies the farm, his mother still living with him. He was married in 1869, to Miss Tilda Oleson. Halver Olson came in 1853, and was a squatter on section seventeen. He moved west a few years ago, and is now dead. Early Settlement. \u2014 The first white man to come to the town, with a view of locating, was Mr. Ed. Stevens, who came here from Cambridge, Wisconsin, with his wife, in the summer of 1852, and his first resting place was on what is now the \"Ike Farm,\" on section twenty-one, but he only remained a few days. That season was uncom monly dry, and the water was so scarce that he struck out for a spring, and succeeded in finding one in the north part of the town, in section four, where he set to work, and with the assistance of his wife, put up a log dweldng, the remains of which are yet to be seen. Christopher Ericson located on section seven teen at an early day. Political Organization. \u2014 The first town meet ing was held in the school house in District No. 37, on the 5th of April, 1859. The officers of the meeting were, Julius Bidings, Moderator; George Mitchell and O. W. Olsen, Judges, and Alexander Simpson, Clerk. The meeting was called to order at ten o'clock. Mr. H. E. Solberg moved that the name of the town be \"Clinton\" which seemed to meet with the approval of the citizens, as the mo tion prevaded. On submitting the question to the \u2022 State authorities, however, this name was rejected, for the reason that there was already a town in the State with the same name. In the year 1854, he sold this claim to Mr. Peter Carrier, Sr., and moved to a mid site behad found unoccupied in Yucatan. Another hardy pioneer was Torkel Aageson, a native of Hanauges, Norway, whose nativity bears date April 1, 1818, and who emigrated to Amer ica in 1851, first stopping in Rock county, Wis consin, and a few months afterwards, pushing on to Winneshiek county, Iowa, from whence he came to this place with an axe on his shoulder, and a pair of iron wedges and beetle rings, arriving in March, 1853. He put his tools to a good use in building a habitation of poplar poles, with a birch bark roof, and there he lived like Alexander Selkirk, all alone, and monarch of all he surveyed, the only white man in town, except Stevens, who was several miles away to the north. At this meeting a resolution was adopted that hogs should be allowed to run at large, and anoth er, that dogs should also be permitted to be at large. The total number of votes cast was twen ty-five. The assessment for road tax was two days work for each poll, and five mdls per cent, on real estate. The town was divided into six road dis tricts, and the boundaries of each specificady de fined. Three road overseers were appointed, Wm. Car rier, for the northern part, John McCabe for the southwest, and Christian Lamen for the south east. At a town meeting on the 31st of December, 1863, it was voted that each volunteer soldier re ceive $300, as a town bounty, and that the draft ed men receive a like amount, payable in town orders. In June several other families came. Mean time Mr. Aageson went vigorously to work split ting rails to enclose some of the land he had claimed, and succeded the first season, in breaking"], [341, "BLACK HAMMER TOWNSHIP. 327 Town Officers, 1881. \u2014 On the 8th of March the fodowin g officers were elected : a regular missionary, holding meetings most fre quently in District No. 37. A frame church was constructed in 1868, in which meetings were held, although it was not quite completed untd the fodowing year. It was not of mammoth proportions, or of very superb finish, but it cost, including a bed of 809 pounds, $4,000. Supervisors, Alex Simpson, Chairman; C. P. Onstad, H. E. Solberg; Clerk, Ole S. Olsen; Assessor, Espen M. Tuftene ; Treasurer, John Senter; Justices of the Peace, Juhus Bdlings and E. F. West; Constables, Wm. Carrier and Andrew C. Anderson. How The Town Was Named. \u2014 Why the town received its singular name is worthy of mention and preservation. It matters little what the name of anything is, if it serves the purpose of a name, which is, if not to characterize it, at least to dis tinguish it from ad else with which it may be con founded. MANUFACTORIES. The manufacturing of the town is confined to domestic work, except a single blacksmith shop, where Berndt Hanson blows the bellows and manipulates the glowing hon. This institution was founded about 1871, by Gunder Mathison. A small saw-mdl was put in on the Riceford Creek, in section twenty-nine, in the year 1858, by David Soper; it never did a large amount of work, and after a while it was totally abandoned In August, 1866, at the time of a terrible flood, the most disastrous ever remembered in the county, it was completely swept away, and at the same time the unfortunate widow and two children of John McCabe were, with the house in which they lived, carried down by the remorseless waters, and met a watery grave; the remains of one of the chddren not being recovered until the next spring. Black Hammer is a most admirable name, be cause there is no other like it in America, nor will be, unless some resident, removing further west, shall carry the name with him, to be engrafted upon a new settlement on the frontier. But this is the way the town finally got its name. Knud Olson Bergo, who was living just across the town line in Spring Grove, on getting up one morning, saw that a fire had swept over the prairie in the south part of the town, including a bluff which formed a part of sections twenty-seven, twenty eight, and thirty-four. Its charred appearance at once suggested to his mind a certain bluff located in Slidre Valders, Norway, which was Mr. Bergo's birth place, and so he exclaimed in Norwegian, \" Sort Hammer,\" which signifies Black Bluff, and the people have had the good sense to retain the name to this day, which, it will be perceived, is composed of an English and a Norwegian word. Mr. Bergo died many years ago, and his dust lies in the Spring Grove cemetery; his widow lives with her only daughter, Mrs. Knud S. Nohre, near Riceford, in the edge of Fillmore county, and the only son, Ole Bergo, lives in one of the western counties of the State. Mr. McCabe was among the first to enlist in the war of 1861, and his bones were left reposing in southern soil. POST-OFFICE. The post-office was not established in this town until 1871, when Gunder Mathison was commis sioned as Postmaster, and when he moved away, a few months afterwards, Mr. Ole S. Oleson took his place, and indicated Mr. B. J. Haug as his deputy. Two years later Mr. Berndt Hanson was appointed, and he is stid the incumbent. The office has always been at private residences on section twenty- seven. It has a tri-weekly service, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays of each week, and is on the route between Houston, Min nesota, and Decorah, Iowa. Religious. \u2014 The church going people of Black Hammer for a number of years attended the church at Spring Grove; but there was, during this time, an occasional religious service at various places in the town. The first of these was held by the Rev. F. C. Clauson at the house of Knud O. Ike, in the early part of 1857. Before this, how ever, a colporteur, named Peter Mehus, had con ducted services in Mr. Ike's house. Up to the time the church was built, the Rev. Mr. Clauson was THE FIRST BIRTH. The first person to be ushered into this unfeeling world in Black Hammer, was Anna Maria Otter ness, daughter of Guttorm Otterness, who was bom in the fall of 1853. She died several years ago."], [342, "328 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. District No. 69. \u2014 This was set off from No. 37, by the County Commissioners on the 18th of May, 1865, in response to a petition of the residents. The first officers were Julius Billings, Clerk; Jos eph Haninan, Director, and Tolef Hogensen, Treasurer. The initial term was taught by Miss Maria O'Connor, at the residence of Julius Bil lings, in 1865. The schoolhouse was completed in 1867, on section twenty-eight, on land of Lars Ericksen. THE FIRST DEATH. This was a daughter of Lars Skime, who died in 1854, and as a burial place, a spot was desig nated on the farm of Torkel Aageson, on the southeast quarter of the northeast qnarter of sec tion twenty-two, where about twenty interments were made prior to the location of the present cemetery near the church, where fine slabs and monuments mark the last resting place of the honored dead of Black Hammer. In the old burial place not a stone or a mound indicates that it was ever used for such a purpose. Distbict No. 80. \u2014 This school district was or iginally carved out of No. 37 by the board of County Commissioners at the March session in 1870. The first officers were: Alex. Simpson, Clerk; John Soutu, Treasurer, and John Cunning ham, Director. During the fall of the same year the schoolhouse was completed. The first term was taught in the spring of 1871, by Miss Ella Dibble. The present officers are identical with those first elected. BLACK HAMMER IN THE WAR OF 1861. The men who early endsted were assigned to Co. F, of the Tenth Minnesota Volunteer Infan try. Their names, as far as can be learned, were as follows: Hans O. Oleson and Chandler Flem ming, who were killed at Nashville, Tennessee. Alvin Smith, who died at Memphis, Tennessee. Silas Carrier, who died at Fort Snelling. Frank Brown, William Cooper, Sdas J. Cooper, Henry Cooper, and John Birdsell. District No. 74.\u2014 On September 9th, 1868, this district sprang into existence, the primary meeting being held at the house of H. E. Solberg, when the following officers were elected: H. B. Allen, Treasurer; Elling Anderson, Director, and H. E. Solberg, Clerk. A site for the school build ing was decided upon on the land of Helge Olsen, on section thirty-five, and a schoolhouse, 16x24 feet, was accordingly erected, and completed the following year. The school was inaugurated by Miss Lena J. Heaul, in the winter of 1870. Those who, about the 1st of October, 1864, went into Co. D, First Minnesota Heavy Artillery were Tosten Johnson, Ole O. Ike,Andrew Christian sen, Ingvald Hansen, Ole O. Ose, John Anderson, and John McCabe; the latter was the only one who did not return, and whose family was drowned as above recorded. A military company was or ganized in the town under the State laws during the war, and didy officered and drilled. The com pany numbered about seventy-five men. Their headquarters were at the schoolhouse, District No. 37. The officers were: Tosten Johhson, Captain; George Mitchell, First Lieutenant, and Lars Lar sen, Second Lieutenant, with the usual non-com missioned officers. The company had a band, the instruments being purchased by the town, consist ing of a Bass Drum, a snare drum, and the ear piercing fife. It must be remembered that when the war came on, this settlement was less than a decade in age, and it is to the infinite credit of the town that so many endsted as actually did. District No. 19. \u2014 A part of the northwest cor ner of the town is embraced in this school district, jointly with Yucatan. District No. 65. \u2014 This takes in a part of the west edge of the town, and is a union organization with a portion of Fillmore county territory. District No. 37. \u2014 We come now to the northern district of the township, and the one first organ ized, and from which the others have been taken. At first it embraced all, or nearly all of the town, and the first schoolhouse was laid up with logs, in a sort of a pic nic way, every man bringing a few logs and an axe, and putting in his work.

The family removed to Lamoille county, Vermont, in 1821,"], [343, "BLACK HAMMER TOWNSHIP. 329 and in 1838, Julius left the old homestead, coming to Winnebago county, Illinois, where he took a claim of 160 acres, on which he farmed until 1852. Then, after disposing of his property, he spent about three years traveling through the States, and finally located in section twenty-eight, Black Hammer township. He immediately erected a a shanty of elm logs, ten by twelve, and seven feet high, in which he kept \"bachelor's hall\" about a year and a half. On the 26th of October, 1862, he was joined in marriage with Miss Cather ine Brophy, a native of Kilkenny county, Ireland, her birth dating the 4th of December, 1843. The issue of this union is six children, all of whom are living and enjoying the shelter of the paternal roof. Since his residence in the town, Mr. Bill ings has held several offices of trust and responsi bility, and was one of the first County Commis sioners, holding the position two terms. He has a well improved farm, with substantial improve ments. break, and served until its close, during which time Peter and his brother had entire charge of the farm. Mr. Glasrad was joined in wedlock on the 7th of November, 1872, with Miss Sarah Quale, of Wilmington, the result of which union is five children. Immediately after the marriage they came to their present home, which Mr. Glasrud had previously purchased. He has, since his resi dence here, held the office of Assessor three suc cessive terms, refusing to qualify when re-elected a fourth time, and is at present one of the school officers of his district. Tosten Johnson, one of the old settlers of the town, is a native of Valders, Norway, born on the 21st of July, 1834. At the age of twelve years he went to Sogndahl to live with his brother-in-law and assist him at his trade, that of blacksmith. In 1851, he came to America, remained in Dane county, Wisconsin, untd the following year, and removed with his brother to Spring Grove. Tos ten made his brother's house his home, but spent most of his time in Iowa, farming during the sum mer months, and attending school in winter, spend ing one year at the University at Fayette. In 1856, he took land in section twenty-seven, Black Hammer, on which he began to make improve ments, still living with his brother. Miss Thora Jesme became his wife on the 3d of March, 1860, and they have since lived on their own farm. Mr. Johnson enlisted in Company D, of the First Min nesota Heavy Artillery, in 1864, and served till the close of the war. Since his residence in this place he has filled a number of local offices, such as As sessor, Town Clerk, etc.; and was elected to the State Legislature in 1869, 1871, and 1873. He was County Commissioner four years, resigning that office to fill the appointment of Mail Agent on the Chicago, Milwaukee & Western railroad, which position he has held since the establishment of the route. William Carrier, one of the early settlers of the town, is a native of Ohio, born in Richland county on the 24th of December, 1829. He was united in marriage with Miss Mary A. Lewis on the 17th of June, 1852. She was born in Picka way county, Ohio, on the 5th of January, 1832. In the fall of 1855, they came to Black Hammer, traveling by stage from Dubuque, Iowa. On the 11th of June, 1864, Mr. Carrier was enrolled in the Second Minnesota Regiment, Company C, taking part in several engagements, the principal of which was the capture of Atlanta, Georgia. He returned to his home in this town at the close of the war, having escaped any severe injury, although his health is now greatly impaired in consequence of the hardships and sufferings endured during his soldier life. He owns a fine farm of two hun dred and twenty acres. Mr. and Mrs. Carrier have seven children, five of whom still live at home. Christian Lamen was born in Trondhjem Stift, Norway, on the 2nd of March. 1828. When eighteen years of age he commenced learning the carpenter trade, which he followed until coming to America in 1850, He resided the first summer in southern Wisconsin; thence to Michigan, where he was engaged at his trade for two years. He after wards worked on the Chippewa River; coming to this town in 1855, and purchasing his present farm in section thirty-five. It is now in excellent condition, with a fine two-story residence, bam, Peter C.

They came to Minnesota in 1854, locating in section twenty -eight, Wil mington township, and erected a temporary house of poplar poles, covered with hay, in which they lived a short time. The subject of this sketch re mained at home until his marriage with Miss Anne Ellestad, which took place on the 7th of Aprd, 1869, after which they moved to an adjacent por tion of the farm, where they lived untd 1872. Mr. Stenehjem then purchased his present farm in Black Hammer, on which they have since resided. After the death of his father, A. A. Stenehjem, which occurred several years ago, the family re moved to Cass county, Dakota, where they now re side. Mr. Stenehjem has a family of four chddren. Christen P. Onstad, a son of one of the early settlers of the town, was born in this place on the 10th of May, 1856, his parents having come here about three years previous to his birth. His father died on the 27th of March, 1876, and Christen be came sole manager of the homestead, and head of the family. He was joined in matrimony on the 27th of June, 1879, with Miss Sarah Ohne Solberg, daughter of H. E. Solberg, also one of the pioneers of Black Hammer. They have been blessed with two chddren, Peter Cor nelius, born on the 21st of June, 1880, and Henry, born on the 15th of September, 1881. Mr. Onstad is one of the Supervisors of the town, to which po sition he was elected in 1880. They still reside on the original homestead on which is a fine house, barn, and outbuildings. Helge E. Solberg, one of the early settlers of the town, is a native of Ringerike, Norway, bom on the 4th of December, 1834. In 1848, he came to America with his parents, who located in Rock county, Wisconsin, remaining eight years. In 1856, they came to this place, and the same year Mr. Solberg was married to Miss Kari Olsen Brennen, who was born in Froen, Gudbransdalen, Norway, on the 9th of March, 1835, and came to America in 1853. Of this union five children have been born, four of whom are living. Mr. Solberg owns about 275 acres of land, the greater portion of which is under cultivation, and improved with substantial buildings. He was elected County Commisioner in 1859, has subsequently been Assessor, and is now a member of the board of Supervisors. Aage Olaus Rosaaen, a son of the second set tler in the town, was born on the 16th of Novem ber, 1861, in this place. He has always made his father's house his home, assisting him on the farm during the summer, and attending school in winter. He subsequently entered the Caledonia Academy, and continued bis studies at Decorah, Iowa. Mr. Rosaaen has a great desire for learning, is possessed of fine natural ability, and, considering his limited advantages, has accumulated a thorough business education. He is a leading correspondent of one of the county newspapers, and also employed in studying telegraphy. Elijah F. West is a native of Genesee county, New York, born on the 21st of September, 1824. When he was an infant of two years, his parents moved to Michigan, Elijah residing with them until the age of twenty-three years. In 1845, he was married to Miss Cinthia Smith, who bore him three children, all of whom are living ; one daugh ter residing in California, another in Dakota, and a son in Carrol county, Iowa. His wife died in the spring of 1852, and her remains were interred in the cemetery at Battle Creek, Michigan. Mr. West was engaged at the carpenter trade until the fall of 1854, when he came to Minnesota, locating in Newburg, Fdlmore county, where he entered one hundred acres of land at government price. During his residence in the latter place he held the office of County Commissioner for one term. In 1856, Miss Jane A. Sherburne became his wife.

Those in the southern part of the county mostly came by way Lansing, unless they came straight across from Wisconsin, while those who settled in the Root River Valley, followed that river. GENERAL DESCRIPTION WILD CAT BLUFF POLIT- ICAL \u2014 MINING OPERATIONS HAOKET's GROVE BROWNSVILLE VILLAGE AND TOWNSHIP MANU- FAOTURING, OHUROHES, SCHOOLS ETO. As to its surroundings, Hokah is on the north, the Father of Waters on the east, Crooked Creek on the south, and Union and May vide on the west. The principal valley is Wild Cat valley, which is, perhaps, one hundred rods wide on an average, and there are several smaller valleys branching off in various directions. The sod of these valleys is of a sandy character, with a clay subsoil, making good wheat land. The bluffs are usually bare of timber on the southern declivities, although on the north sides of the hills, and on the ridges, and in the ravines, there is hard wood timber in abundance. The material of the bluffs is sandstone as a base, with limestone near the top, and some good quarries have been opened where lime is made. Either variety of stone is valuable for building purposes, and as the rock crops out at convenient points, this kind of building material can be procured at a trifling expense. Some of the land can only be used for pasturage. The hidsides are admirably adapted to the raising of grapes, and this industry has received considera ble attention. On the Mississippi River there are five towns in Houston county, and Brownsville is the center one. The river opposite the village is compact, with no intervening sloughs, affording a natural landing, and this condition first attracted Mr. Brown in his quest for a town site. The town embraces a part of two government townships, and is several sections smaller than a full town. Aside from the Mississippi, the principal river is Wild Cat Creek, coming from the west, and a branch from the south which comes in a mile west of the town, and uniting with the main creek, gets into the Mississippi by the way of a slough that starts opposite the lower end of the town. Wild Cat Bluff is the highest point along the river for miles, and was a prominent landmark for the early steamboat pilots. The town itself has the valleys carrying the streams, and the precipi tous bluffs leading to the elevated plateaus, with prairie like expansions, covered with fine farms. The lowlands and the highlands each have their peculiarity as to soil, but are about equally sought after for agricultural purposes, and maintain an industrious and thriving population. The bluffs along the Mississippi River, at this point, require more than a passing notice here. Ages ago, when the Mississippi was much wider than it now is, the country hereabouts was on a level with the tops of the bluffs and ridges, and all these valleys and ravines have been worn away by The landing at Wild Cat Bluff was the point of debarkation for a large number of the early set tlers of the county, particularly those going to"], [346, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 332 the agencies employed by the corroding hand of time.

Stephen Reynolds; Codector, Jacob Reider; Con stables, Stephen Reynolds and Michael Brady; Overseers of the poor, Edward Bogan and L. D. Selfridge. The board met on the 15th of May, and suc cessfully started the town government, and it has run with little jarring up to the present wri ting. The most noticeable elevation on the river is Wild Cat Bluff, which rises nearly five hundred feet from the very river's bank. And, as there was a natural landing there, so unlike the sloughs and marshy banks at most other places along the river, it is no wonder that it attracted the atten tion of Mr. Brown, as he floated down in quest of a town site. The present officers of the town are:- Supervis ors, Thomas Corcoran, Chairman; James Hayes, Charles Graf; Clerk, Francis Duffy; Treasurer, Walter Colleran, and Assessor, Michael Hurley. It is not unusual for magistrates chosen at town elections to refuse to qualify, as most of such busi ness as they might get, goes to the county seat, or to the village justices. Wild Cat Bluff has been the theme of legend, song, and story, and an apostrophe written by one of the old settlers is here transcribed: LINES TO WILD CAT BLUFF AHD HER KINDRED HILLS* MINING OPERATIONS. Several shafts have been sunk, and considerable sums expended in explorations for mineral in the township of Brownsville. The immediate incen tive to this work was the following story, which is substantiady correct: O, rock ribbed hills, could you rehearse Your history in simple verse, Your stories of the olden time Might furnish food for thoughts sublime. Eternal monuments of old, Stern witnesses of ages past, A party of United States soldiers and several practical engineers, who had previously had varied experience in the discovery of the lead near Ga lena, Illinois, encamped near the foot of Wild Cat Bluff as early as 1832, and prospected there for lead, and, after examining many caves, aud making numerous excavations without success, they eventually sunk a shaft 105 feet deep, a mile and a half directly west of the above named bluff, and discovered a large deposit of lead. After do ing this much, those early miners were compelled to move on, but before doing so they filled the shaft with loose earth, brush and stones, macada mizing the opening and finishing with a large key stone. It was the intention of two of the engi neers, and practical miners, to keep their discov eries a secret, and after the expiration of their terms of service, return to the scene of their pros pective wealth, and thoroughly develop its re sourses and secure the mines for their future ben efit. Owing to a combination of circumstances, however, these miners never returned. The Mex ican war followed; they were both wounded, one mortally, and the other lost his legs. This man who lost his legs, supposing that he was going to die, imparted to a confiden tial friend the whereabouts, and also instructed him how to find the mines. A few years ago Mr. George Graf, the present proprietor of the land How long have you stood sentinels, In summer sun and blast? Your lofty peaks, all gray with years, Point heavenward, where hopes and fears Are set at rest. The depths below The mysteries tell of long ago. O, mighty hills, I pray you say, How many summer suns are past, How oft the flowers have died away, Chilled by the howling autumn's blast? How many lifeless forms at rest, With green grass growing o'er each breast, How many hundred graves grown cold, Containing secrets never told, How many wild and thrilling scenes Upon your heights have taken place, How many sweet poetic dreams Have found a cradle at your base? And Wild Cat Bluff, above the rest, I see your tall and snowy crest So far above the river side, God's record of the time and tide, I love your dreamy, silent way, I love your solitude to share, And had life but one hopeful day, I'd climb your heights, and spend it there.

At the first election, on that day, the officers were elected as fodows: Super visors, Frederick Gluck, Chairman ; James Ruddy, and Mr. Lynn; Clerk, L. Holstein; Assessor, *By. O. W.

Mr. Graf, in order to satisfy his curiosity, if nothing more, made up his mind to investigate the matter, and upon careful investigation, he found everything as stated by the old gentleman, except the lead. at this place, attended by the people of the town, Captain Foster, Mr. Emory Hacket, Samuel Mc- Phad and other prominent citizens participated, the festivities having closed with a dance in the evening. BROWNSVILLE VILLAGE. This village was platted and recorded by Job and Charles Brown, immediately after the county was organized. It has since had several additions extending it up the river, on the north, and down the river, on the south, and extending well up the hid to the west of the lower end of the vidage. The principal street is Front Street, the second stories of the buildings on the west side are usually on a level with the ground, and the cellars are ex cavated as tunnels into the bluff. In 1875, Mr. William McCormick sunk a shaft on section twenty-two, sixty feet deep, and found about fifteen pounds of lead ore. On the 4th of March, 1877, he began another shaft and put it down 100 feet the first year, working it for the most part in the winter. At this depth he found water which impeded the progress; it is now down 200 feet. One reason for supposing mineral to be available at the particular point where he began work, was that lightning frequently struck there. About $2,000 has thus far been expended here, and the work is still going on with expert miners. A lateral drift has been run, following the crevice in an irregular dirrection, some seventy five feet. Spring Branch arises near a western addition to the village, and pours into Wild Cat Creek. The railroad runs along the river's edge, on a grade some feet lower than Front Street. As to the topography of the village; it lies at the foot of a bluff 486 feet high, which rises from near the river, the vidage extending around the base into a ravine. The business part of the vil lage is twenty-five feet above the river, while that part situated in the ravine is thirty or forty feet above the river. The character of the sod along the river is sandy, and super- imposed on a sand rock, while back from the river it is more muddy. The supply of water is principally from wells, and those along the base of the bluff furnish clear water, but that procured from wells in the ravine is unfit for domestic use. Springs are numerous, and furnish good water. Mr. Bernhard Graf commenced prospecting in the winter of 1877, on section fifteen, and pene trated the earth to a depth of sixty-five feet, when the water prevented further progress, with the means at command. In the winter of 1878, he opened another shaft, and with the aid of an old miner, got down to a depth of ninety-two feet, with good indications of success. But this, after wards caved in, and he is now engaged on another, having got down sixty-five feet, and is sanguine as to his success in the immediate future. The presumption is that with the lead there will be a large amount of silver, as these minerals are not unfrequently found together. Should these hopes and anticipations prove to be well founded, the whole character of Brownsvide will at once be changed; its former activity wdl return, and wdl be vastly improved upon. We are constantly trampling the world under foot, but no one knows what he treads upon. Let us hope, in this case that d disappointed, it wdl be on the agreeable side. An account of a voyage up the Mississippi, pub dshed before this region was settled, alludes to one of the voyagers' resting places, which was at the foot of Wild Cat Bluff, as fodows: \"On the west as you go up the river was what we called the ' Camp of the peak,' where we lay nestled in a dense forest, overhung by one of the noblest sum mits I have ever seen.

The Village Government. \u2014 The vidage was incorporated in 1858. The early records were maliciously destroyed some years ago, whether to cover up some transactions that would not bear in spection, or in a spirit of mere mischief, is not This was at one time a promising locality. In 1857, a Post-office was established there. Mr. Hacket himsed was Postmaster until 1866, when it was withdrawn.

James Hickey appeared in Aprd, 1854 and planted his stakes on section ten. Jonathan Hall took his claim on section four the same year, as did also John Shedey, who at first stopped a few miles above the village, but two years later moved into the vidage. Between this time and 1857, Thomas Gavin, John Flannery, Joseph Keefe and others dawned upon the scene. known. The officers elected were the more promi nent men of the vidage at that time, and the vd lage government has been for the most part, of a conservative character, the exceptions being in the case of the extraordinary power conferred by a special act of the legislature upon the school board, and which they used in such a way that a heavy burden was imposed upon the vidage. This drove off many of the business men, and the vdlage has not entirely recovered. In 1873, Mar tin Luther Cooper, a representative in the State Legislature, procured the passage of a special act, authorizing the village board of education to levy a tax at its discretion for school purposes. To abbreviate a tedious story, a brick schoolhouse was built at a cost of $10,000, and a heavy debt in curred at twelve per cent, interest, upon which more than $20,000 has already been paid, and the debt is not yet extinguished, although the end can now be seen in the not distant future. Charles Brown built the first frame budding in 1850, and this was afterward used as a schoolhouse. Mr. Brown also, with an enterprise most commend able, built the first pubhc building, which was called the Town Hall, and was used as a church and schoolhouse, and is now the Methodist Episcopal Church. In this building, in May, 1857, Miss. M. J. Wells began a school. The trustees of this school were, A. McLaren, Charles Brown, and J. H. Smith. This building was used for school pur poses untd the present costly edifice was put up. THE FIRST SAW-MILL. The present village officers are: Trustees, J. M. Riley, President; M. S. Roster, Leonard Schwartz, and Michael Feeney; Recorder, Lyman Loomis; Marshal, Julius Hankee; Police Justice, Alex. McLaren; Justice of the Peace, C. E. McCan; and Constable, Henry Fostler. In the fall of 1855, Job and Charles Brown and Alexander McLaren got a saw-mill in operation. Mr. McLaren sold out the next spring to the Browns. The following spring, 1857, Job sold his interest to Charles, and a year later, Taylor and Fox, of Stillwater, took the property, and Mr. Hersheimer, of La Crosse, operated the concern during the season of 1859. John Ireland secured it in 1860, and carried it on up to about 1868, when Ed. Bell purchased a one-half interest and the firm of Bell <fe Ireland kept it in motion till January 28th, 1869, when the boder exploded and John Ireland was killed. Jesse Bell pur chased the interest of Ireland's estate, and the Bed Brothers, procuring a new boiler, resumed operations, manufacturing lumber, lath, and shingles. The Earliest Settlement. \u2014 Job and Charles Brown and James Hiner came to the present site of Brownsville in November, 1848, which ante dates any other settlement in the county. Job Brown had previously visited the locadty, and pro nounced it an ehgible spot for a Mississippi town. James Hiner remained until 1855, when he went to Caledonia to reside. Mrs. Hiner was a sister of the Browns, and arrived in May, 1849, with her little four years old daughter, who is now Mrs. James H. Williams, of Hokah. Thus Mrs. Hiner was the first white woman to reside in Houston county, and Martha, her daughter, the first white child. Mrs. Hiner was born in Ontario county, New York, in 1824; she died at Hokah at 12 o'clock, on the 17th of May, 1871, and was buried near Caledonia. Mr. Hiner is also dead. The first grist-mid was built by Job Brown in 1856, although in the saw-mill there was a run of stones for grinding corn, but when Brown budt the mdl on Spring Branch Creek, the stones were taken from the saw-mdl. But this institution has long since passed away. In 1855, there were only two houses where Main street now is, and Chris. Gerhardt and Hans Miller built a road on the present line of the street by digging into the side of the bluff and removing stumps, &c. EARLY TOWNSHIP SETTLERS. George Shrof, John Whitlow, Mr. Stone, and Mr. Watson, located on the ridge north of the vil lage, which has been known as Connaught ridge, because so many there were from that province in Ireland. Dennis Sheehan settled there and put up a claim shanty in 1853. Wm.

Several other athletes, in the same persua sive manner, induced the court to move toward the door, which, having been reached, and the room emptied of its motley throng, it was locked, and the case was thus adjourned sine-dii . A Flogging Affair.\u2014 After Caledonia, had been quite well settled, and Mr. McPhail had be come tolerably well fixed in worldly matters, the eccentric Patrick Fitzpatrick related an incident in the career of the proprietor of the village plat that created quite an excitement, especially in the breast of the object of the story, who took the first opportunity to horsewhip its author. The case got into a Justice's court in Brownville, and the developments were rich. The partisans of Fitzpatrick, who embraced all of his nationality in the county, were on hand, and for a time there was imminent danger of personal violence, but it was finally averted, and the agitation subsided. The very first building put up in town was by the Browns and Hiner, and was of unhewn logs, 14x12 feet with a \"shaker\" roof. It was about three hundred yards above the stone warehouse. The second house was just above the spring, and was afterwards sold to \"Wild Cat Jack,\" which was the first real estate transaction in the county. This Wild Cat Jack, as he was called, was a noted character in his day, and,as has already been stated, shot himself to death in an accidental way, while flourishing a pistol in one of his revels. SOME EARLY INCIDENTS. At first, before things had got settled down to anything like routine, the Justices courts were the scenes, not unfrequently of the most ludicrous character. On one occasion there had been some hilarity in Houston, a lot of young men breaking into a cellar, under a Norwegian residence, where some kind of meeting was in progress, and tap ping a barrel of whisky, had a war dance around a bucket full of the exhilirating fluid in the front yard, putting out the inmates and compeding them to join in the frantic revels, and pummeling those who refused, \"sweetly and without wrath,\" with other festive goings on. The whole party had warrants out for their arrest, and the officer went over from Brownsville to serve the papers. Charles Brown and the Indian. \u2014 A short time after the first colony was planted, a hungry Indian asked Charles for a kettle in which to cook his dinner, which was given him, and be proceeded to make a soup of the biggest kind of an owl. He had just bolted the last of the savory mess when Charles finished cooking a large pot of beans. Job Brown and Wild Cat Jack came home to din ner, and a panful was handed to the Indian, with the remark, \"you watch me kill that Indian;\" well, he ate three pansful and walked off with a grunt of satisfaction, leaving the rest to eat a beanless dinner. The Indian's capacity had been clearly underestimated. He was told that it was all right, he could ar- rest the whole crowd, but he must return alone, and if he would give notice of the day of trial, the accused would be on hand. So when the time ar- rived they were there in full force. Mr. McSpad- den, who was on the list, announced, when the case was caded, that he had been retained as counsel for the defense, and he proposed that everything should be done \"decently and in order,\" that the precedents of frontier jurisprudence should not be overruled, and he therefore respectfully suggested that the first thing in order was for the court and the complainant to go out and take a drink. To this proceeding the Justice entered a mild demur- rer, which was speedily overruled by the indomita- ble \"Mack,\" who took the complainant, Mr. Knud- son, by the arm, and by using a sufficient amount of physical argument he was induced to yield the Punishment of a Criminal. \u2014 At one time be fore the stumps were dug out of the streets, a mis erable fellow was apprehended for some petty crime; he was tried before an improvised court, and the question as to hanging him forthwith, gravely discussed. It was finally concluded that he should pay a fine and dig out a certain stump in the street, and in default thereof he was to be summarily executed. With manifest gratitude at his narrow escape from impending death, he went to work under a blazing sun and came well nigh dying from sunstroke, but he succaeded in satisfy ing his tormentors, and made no unnecessary delay in placing himsed beyond the jurisdiction of this erratic backwoods court, by getting aboard of the first steamer that touched the wharf. The Barbecue. \u2014 The 4th of July, 1855, was celebrated in Brownsvdle in the most vehement"], [350, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 336 manner. The arrangements were on a style com mensurate with the ideas of the citizens as to the importance of the metropolis of the Southern Dis trict of Minnesota. Mr. Fred. Gluck, a few days before, was dispatched to Iowa to purchase an ox, and he returned with the animal on the evening of the third, when it was slaughtered, and a trench having been dug in which a fire had been kept untd a sufficient amount of fine coals, to carry on the roasting, had accumulated, when the whole carcass, with the four quarters spread out, was laid over the fiery furnace, a steamboat having been laid under contribution for iron bars to hold it up. With frequent turnings and bastings it was finally cooked, and fed to the multitude in the afternoon of the glorious fourth, after the procession, the reading of the Declarjtion of Independence, the oration and other exercises. Mr. L. A. Smith, who was the earliest merchant in the village, paid for the ox, and Wm. Irving and Wm. Powers dug the pit. Besides the ox there were roast pigs, bread etc. and a barrel of whisky, and the people were in vited to help themselves. Asa Langford was the chief cook, Charles Brown the orator of the day, and the editor was the reader of the Declaration of Independence. Nothing like this has happened since. It was indeed a great occasion. The town was full, every available room and stall, to ac commodate man and beast was filled, and many of the horses and oxen had to stand in the streets. Where the people all came from was a problem difficult to answer. There must have been no end of fun at that celebrated barbecue, which is still alluded to by the old timers, with the broadest kind of a smile, which plainly indicates that it should be recorded on a red letter page of the history of the county. tages. Among them was a plan to dam the Root River, and by a canal six miles long, turn its waters into the Mississippi River right here, thus secu ring a water power of twelve feet fad. Indeed, if the enthusiastic pioneers had had millions of dol lars at their disposal, they would have unhesita tingly put it into improvements, with fud confi dence in prompt returns. Wild Cat Bluff. \u2014 There have been numerous stories as to the origin of the name given to the larger of the three bluffs south of Wild Cat Creek. It is related that a Frenchman, at an early day, had a desperate encounter, at the base of this bluff, with an enormous wild cat, and it thus re ceived its name. Soon after the settlement of the Browns, they shot a very large wild cat, up the creek, brought it to their shanty, skinned and stuffed it, and elevated it near the landing, where it remained until destroyed by the moths and the elements. This pinned the place as Wild Cat Landing. Another incident connected with this wild cat affair, is vouched for as being authentic. Charles Brown was of a peculiar, eccentric turn, and desperately enamored with everything belong ing to his adopted State. He proposed to eat specimens of all kinds of game produced here, so he cooked and ate a part of this wdd cat. A FRIGID CURIOSITY. In the center of section thirty-four, some years ago (about 1861) Mr. C. Gerhardt sunk a well, and at the depth of forty feet water flowed in and froze, fiding the well to within a few feet of the top with solid ice, which remained untd the winter of 1878, when Messrs, Johnson & Neumeier dug in to the bluff a few rods east of the well, lower down, which caused this ice to melt, so that now there is only a few feet in depth in the bottom of the wed. The philosophy of this remarkable phe nomenon has not been explained. Among the prominent men in Brownsville at this time, and those who participated in the cele bration as committees, and in other capacities were: Dr. J. G. Sheldon, Dr. G. R. Shaw, Rev. E. T. Grant, J. R. Bennett, W. F. Ross, M. G. Thompson, W. H. Crawford, Thomas Lee, D. N. Gates, James McDonald, Charles Brown, Job Brown, L. D. Selfridge, Charles Massey, P. D. Hough, L. D. Smith, Fred. Gluck, E. A. Goodell, Charles Mider, J. E. Cunningham, with others who might be named. PROSPERITY IN EARLY DAYS. In 1855, the levee was crowded with goods, and during the quarter ending on the 30th of June the land sales amounted to $74,292. The census of the county then gave 2,616 souls. There was a theater in succesful operation at that time in the vidage, and lots were sold at from one to eight hundred dollars each. In the fall of 1855, a Sun day school was started in the store of Gates & Wykoff. At the beginning of this year there were only fifty inhabitants in the village, and there Early Plans and Prospects. \u2014 At an early day in the history of Brownsvide, various schemes were concocted to secure commercial and other advan-"], [351, "BROWNSVILLE TOWNSHIP. 337 were twenty offices and stores; but during the year forty-five new buildings were erected, and the number of people increased to two hundred and twenty-eight. ical reminder of what might have been. Among those present were: Annie Rippe, Mrs. Alexander and her husband, Mrs. Holden and her husband, Maggie Rippe, Lizzie Holden, Sarah Gluck, Min nie Bielteldt, Amelia Brenner, Nellie Winslow, Josephine McCan, Alice McCan, Lizzie Walters, Miss Walters, Albert Lowell, M. R. Cluss, George Brenner, H. W. Le Blond, George Schaller, W. Schaller, E. M. Winslow, John Brenner, Alfred Lowell, David Lee, Charles Fetzner, E. Palmer, Geo. Rippe, and Otto Cluss. It will be noticed that there are more gentlemen than ladies; this was occasioned by several ladies having invited a gentleman and his brother, where he was unpro vided for, or some friend in a like condition. This was evidently in obedience to a literal interpreta tion of the golden rule. Where a lady was en cumbered with two partners, she gracefully allowed them to \"draw straws\" as to which should precede the other. The affair was happily conceived, and becomingly executed, and the lessons in polite ness, although not necessardy needed, must have served as a valuable reminder, leaving an impres sion which will certainly last untd another year, that can be divided by four without a remainder, rolls around. EARLY STAGE ROUTES. On the 1st of July, 1856, the following stage lines carrying the mail were put on : Brownsville to Chatfield, via Hokah, Houston, and Rushford. Brownsville to Caledonia via Elliota. Browns ville to Travers de Sioux. D. A. J. Baker was the contractor. An Epidemic. \u2014 In 1857, the small pox swept through the village. There were sixteen deaths. LOCAL STEAMBOATS. Of course, ever since there was a log hut at Wild Cat Bluff, this has been a landing point for Mississippi steamboats, and in 1863, the necess ity of direct communication with La Crosse be came so obvious, that early that spring the steamer \" Spray\" was put on. It was owned by Harvey Rumsey, and run by Capt. Whittaker for three months, when she was succeeded by the \"Express,\" owned and run by Capt. G. L. Winslow. This continued on the line up to 1873, when, becoming unseaworthy, she was hauled off, and Capt. Wins low built the steamer \" Vigor,\" to perform the same work. About this time the radroad com pany put on the steamer \"Gussie Girdon,\" as a transfer boat. Captain Winslow, finding that it would not pay to continue in competition, pulled off and went down the river to engage in business there, but in about two years the railroad com pany discontinued the trips of the Gussie Girdon, and Captain Winslow returned with his little craft and is still here. MANUFACTURING. Wild Cat Flouring Mill. \u2014 In 1866, this mdl came into existence, at the instance of George Schader. The dimensions were 40x50 feet, two and one-half stories high, and a basement. The power is derived from Wild Cat Creek, which has a fall of twenty-four feet, and is used by an over shot wheel nineteen feet in diameter. At first it was a two-run niiU, with first-class machinery. In 1875, the mill was remodeled, and purifiers and rolls introduced. The mill was transferred, in 1870, to the Schaller Brothers, J. C. & J. P., who still operate it is a merchant and a custom mil], turning out from thirty to thirty-five barrels a day. A new dam was budt in 1872-73, at a cost of $3,900. The Vigor was built at La Crosse in 1872, and is a propellor of twenty -four tons register. The Ex press was a stern wheel affair of thirty-five tons burthen. Among the steamers on the river in 1857, were the Grey Eagle, Northern Light, Key City, Milwaukee, and Itaska. As early as 1355, Job Brown owned the steamer H. M. Rice. Artesian Well. \u2014 The Schaller Brothers have proved the feasibility of artesian wells through this strata. In 1878, a well was sunk near the mdl to a depth of 590 feet, with a hose of six inches, which discharges about fifteen feet above the surface about 950 gallons of clear, sparkling water per minute, at a regular temperature, sum mer and winter, of 54J degrees. The work was done by Swan Brothers, of Janesville, Wisconsin, LEAP YEAR PARTY. On Tuesday evening, January 4th, 1880, there was a Leap Year party at the Minne sota House, and a list of those present will be given, although the ladies with their part ners will not be placed vis-a-vis, because, as time rolls on, it may not be advisable to have a histor- 22"], [352, "338 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. in six and one-half days, at a cost of $2.00 per lineal foot.

In 1866, the Brownsville Brew ery was in the hands of Adolph Schwartzhoff and Frederick Gluck, and on the 15th of November it was burned, when Mr. Gluck withdrew from the firm, and it was rebuilt by Mr. Schwartzhoff as sole proprietor.

The Land Office only received coin in payment for government land, and a large part of the business of this institution was to supply the land buyers with specie to complete their government pur chases. When the Land Office moved on to Chat field, the bank was discontinued. Mr. Ripley was afterward appointed to the supreme bench of the State. There are several others engaged in various kinds of business, but the trade of the town is now in remarkable contrast with 1870, when there were nearly fifty stores in active operation. A St. Louis firm is, in the winter of 1882, getting in ice above the town, and will secure about 10,000 tons. Physicians. \u2014 There are two medical doctors in town, Dr. J. M. Rdey and Dr. W. W.

The present trustees are P. Connolly, Walter Colleran, and Mr. Hurley. District No. 33. \u2014 Formerly, this was num bered eleven. In January, 1856, it first saw the light as an organization, in the house of Timothy Hacket, where a school was started during the summer. In the fall there was a donation party, and logs were rolled up for a schoolhouse. The trus tees were Harvey Fassett, Emory Hacket, and Silas Torrence. The first teacher was Miss Pound, who taught for three months. In 1880, a half acre of land was bought of James Daily, and the next year the Christian Church was purchased and moved on to the lot. The present officers are, Hugh Kelly, Michael McDonnell, and Peter Mc- Cabe. The first school meeting of the district was on the 9th day of August, 1856. Job Brown, Alex. McLaren, and J. H. Smith became trustees, D. N. Gates, clerk. So few persons were present the meeting was adjourned to the 16th of August, at which time there were less present, and the meeting adjourned \"sine die.\" The first public school was in the winter of 1857-58. In 1858, the first schoolhouse was built; frame, 24x30, one story, costing about $400; S. O. Felton was the budder. On the 1st of January, 1859, there were 67 scholars in the district. District No. 31. \u2014 This school was commenced about 1857, at the house of Arthur Mullen. Miss Mary Murphy was the first instructor. Edward Bogan was one of the first trustees. Previous to the completion of the present budd ing, January, 1874, three separate buildings were used by the district at the same time, for school purposes, for several years, with three teachers, one male and two females. District No. 68. \u2014 In the autumn of 1867, ten years after the other districts described came into existence, this was organized, and the first school kept was in the old residence of Patrick Sweeney. Miss Delia Lane wielded the emblem of authority. The earliest trustees were, Patrick Sweeney, James Daily, and Jacob Sharrard. The house was erect ed in 1868. The trustees now are, John Sweeney, Henry Toole, and Peter Welsh. School was first opened in the new building at the time of its completion, January 5, 1874, with four teachers, one male and three females. The principal was P. O. Phillips; salary $100 per month; female teachers, $40 per month each. The new building is a two story brick, 38 by 69 feet, with stone basement. The contract price, without seats or furnace, was $8,600. It is the most costly and complete school building in the county. District No. 73. \u2014 In the year 1868, this dis trict was got together at the house of Ira Butter field, and Miss Hellen Butterfield presided over the exercises. It is a joint district, with part of the pupils in Hokah, as is also the school building. The school now has 186 pupils. The teachers areC. W. Nash, Miss A. M. McCan, and Miss R. Higgins. Distict No. 61. \u2014 In 1857, this district was set apart and a house built. The primary trustees were, James Ruddy, John Deiuch, and John Flannery, and the earliest teacher, Miss Mary Ruddy, who kept the first term three months. The present trustees are, John Flannery, Charles Graf, and John Keefe. District, No. 32. \u2014 This came into existence in 1857, and a school house was built in 1858. The earliest trustees were John Palmer, Isaac Maul, and Jonathan Cox. The first instructor was Augustus McPherson, and the term was for three months. The present trustees are John Riley, Director; Wm. M. Colleran, Clerk; Mark Zuber, Treasurer. This was at first No. 39, but after wards changed. The people of the town have never been remiss in doing what they could for the education of their children. District No. 64. \u2014 In 1857, this district was organized. John Duggan was the first teacher, the schoolhouse having been built the first year. The trustees chosen were John Hall, John Sullivan, and Patrick Long. The first school was kept three months. The number of that district at first was thirty-seven. The house first put up was on sec tion eight, but in 1872, it was moved to section District No. 10, was started in 1853, and James A.

It was at first a missionary point, and among the early clergymen was Rev. Lud wig Ebert, who was here the year the church was erected. Rev. Frederick Reitz came in 1866, and remained until 1871, when John Jahn, now of Winnebago, took charge, and was here for six years when Rev. F. Koysetka assumed the pastor ate. In 1880, Rev.

The pastor, when the building was secured, was Rev. C. J. Hayes, and there were then fifteen members. The church was dedicated the first Sunday in March, 1866, the presiding Elder, Rev. Mr. Perigrine, being present. The earliest trustees were John Tarr, Mark Percival, C. H. Lee, and Job Brown. Other prominent members were James Nichols, M. V. Nichols, Abram Ozmun, C. G. Ayers, and John Day. Roman Catholic. \u2014 In 1859, the church in the vdlage of Brownsville was built. The first resi dent pastor is reported as being Rev. Father Ed ward Essing, in 1862. He was followed by Rev. Father Joseph Neubrand, in 1864, who remained one year. He was succeeded by the Rev. Father Mathew Sterenberg, who resigned the charge in 1870, and Rev. Father P. K. Ryan received the appointment. In 1871 and '72 the present fine church was constructed. The corner stone was laid under the charge of Rev. Father Ryan. The building cost about $15,000, and can com fortably seat 250 persons. It is of brick and stone, has a bed tower, and a bell that cost $300. There are now about 750 baptized members. At first there were only straggling priests, but after awhile Father Pendergast, Father Essing, Father Neubrand and others came. The very first remem bered service was in 1855, at the house of Mr. Burke, by Bishop Cretin, of St. Paul. THE COMMERCIAL AND MANUFACTURING ADVANTAGES OF BROWNSVILLE. The site of Brownsville, viewed from the river, is somewhat unfavorable to the superficial observer, but back from the landing there is a large, level, and beautiful tract of land finely adapted for de sirable residences. Here is plenty of space for any increase of population which the town may have for years, and on this beautiful plateau are sit uated many of the fine buddings and beautiful residences of the town. Cemetery \u2014 The burial place connected with this church is four mdes west of the village, in section thirty-two, and contains four acres, which were presented by Edward Bogan, whose monument is a most conspicuous object.

Aside from being a place to which logs are rafted from the pine regions higher up the river, at the northern limits of the place there is a large bayou, capable of holding millions of logs, and around which a large number of saw-mills might be erected, which can immediately enter into a flourishing and profitable business, not only for supplying the demand at home, but also a foreign market.

He was married at Hastings Landing, now Genoa, Wis consin, to Mary Ann Davidson, the event taking place on the 10th of September, 1851. They have had eleven children, ten of whom are living. James O'Brophy, a native of Ireland, was born in a part of Lismatigue, called Gaulstown, in the united parish of Balyhahill and Anghavdle, Kd kenny county, his birth occurring in September, 1818. He was reared on a farm and attended school in Lismatigue and Harristown. In May, 1850, he came to America, but returned to Ire land the same year, and came again to this country landing in New York in August, 1854. He went immediately to Baltimore; thence to Ohio, where he married Miss Catherine Dungan, the ceremony taking place in Hamilton, Butler county, in Janu ary, 1855. Mrs. O'Brophy was born in Glindand, parish of Mullaunevat, Kilkenny county, in the year 1810. In 1856, they came to the then terri tory of Minnesota, locating in Newburg, Fillmore county, but came to their present farm the same year.

Job Brown, the founder of Brownsvide, was born in Yates county, New York, on the 7th of February, 1823. His mother died when he was seven years old. His father was a blacksmith and farmer, and after his wife's death came to Michi gan, where he found a new home for his family, for whom he sent in a short time. Job, however, started alone for the West, was shipwrecked on the lakes, and did not reach his father's place for nearly a year after the others had arrived. Two years later he came to the Mississippi River, and operated in the lead mines at Galena until the Mexican war, when he enlisted in Company F, of the First Illinois Infantry, under Captain Crow. He attained quite a notoriety as a reckless and des perate man, especially when under the influence of liquor, to the use of which he was moderately ad dicted. On receiving his discharge in 1848, he returned to his old haunts, and soon came up the river and located at what was then known as \"Wild Cat Bluff,\" but now Brownsvdle, a description of which has already appeared in these pages. In 1856, he went to Riceford, in the western part of this county, laid out and platted the town, budt a mill, and was one of its first business men. He remained there until 1860, and during the time became converted and began to preach. He then returned to Brownsvide, and two years later, went to Winona, where he was engaged in mercan tile business and farming for a number of years. In 1868, he became a preacher in the Second Ad- Charles Brown. This enterprising pioneer was bom in Ontario county, New York, in 1826, and came to Houston with his brother and brother in-law in November, 1848. In 1838, he moved to Michigan, where he attended the White Pigeon Academy. On his arrival here he at once set to work in the interest of the town and county, and was really the moving spirit in most of the enterprises set on foot at that time; he was a joint proprietor of the land upon which the village was built, and was for several years the editor of the paper here.

During his residence in the latter place he was married to Miss Ann Walter, on the 10th of May, 1838. She was born in Baltimore, Mary land, on the 23d of December, 1817, and at the age of eighteen years moved to Providence.

Court House square is two blocks south of Main Street. On the northeast part of the block is the jail, a most creditable looking building, which is elsewhere described; south of this is the Court House, a purposeless looking structure, which the county has outgrown, and which, in due time, will be replaced by a budding for county purposes in accordance with present and future requirements. CHAPTER LII. DESCRIPTIVE EARLY SETTLEMENT INCIDENTS VILLAGE HISTORY CHURCHES SCHOOLS MAN- UFACTURING BUSINESS DIRECTORY. This is the shire town of Houston county, and it has a village of the same name, originally laid out on section thirteen, which is of course on the eastern boundary of the township. As it would be impossible to divorce them, the town and village wid be treated together in the following sketch, with perhaps a slight variation. The other buildings for public purposes, churches and schools, are quite up to the average in vidages no older than this. The building ma terial is commonly of wood, although there are several of stone and a few of brick. The dwellings are good comfortable structures, and there are quite a number of fine residences, with ornamental grounds, some as which wid, in another place, re ceive special mention. The village is but a few miles from the geo graphical center of the county, and is near the head of Crooked Creek valley. It is a dozen miles or so from the Mississippi, and lays high and dry on a roldng prairie, 550 feet above the river. The village is regularly laid out, with the direction of the streets corresponding with the cardinal points of the compass. There are many shade trees, which wdl, as they become mature with age, give the village a more picturesque appearance. The blocks vary in size, but are usually nearly square, are without alleys in either direction, and contain from eight to ten lots. As to healthfulness, there can be no more salu brious climate, or physical surroundings more con ducive to health and longevity, than is presented in Caledonia, where there are no prevailing dis eases, and where the chronic remark of one doctor to another is that \"it is distressingly healthy.\" The principal business street is Main Street, an east and west thoroughfare, although two of the cross streets, Marshall and Kingston, are devoted largely to business purposes, as will be seen in the account of the business firms in town. North of Main is Lincoln, Grant, Caledonia, and High Streets. South of Main, is Grove, Washington, and Court Streets. For cross streets, the town line is east of the center of the village.and on that is the county road, beyond which the streets are named First, Second, etc. West of the public road the streets are East, Badger, Pine, Marshall, Kingston, Decora, Ramsey, and Hokah. The streets are of the usual width, many of them having plank sidewalks. Some of the crossings are plank and some are of stone. Water here, if sought for in the earth, has to be procured at uncertain, and sometimes great depths; and although the prevailing opinion may not co incide with the statement, it is nevertheless be lieved to be true, that cistern water, if properly fil tered, taken as it falls from the clouds, before it has passed through the obnoxious decomposing vege table elements on the surface of the earth, is much preferable to water which has taken up organic or mineral substances in its passage through the ground. The difficulty of procuring water by means of wells, has compelled the people, against"], [363, "CALEDONIA TOWNSHIP. 349 their will, to use cistern water, which is in every way preferable for domestic and stock purposes. As an early settlement it is antedated by Browns vdle, which was at first the county seat, but on account of its location, and it being al ready a very thriving vdlage, it was soon located here to remain, although there have been several more or less vigorous efforts made to have the county seat removed to one of the towns on the line of the Southern Minnesota railroad. Caledonia is a place of considerable trade which is supplied by the residents in the vicinity, as well as its own citizens. When the railroad, connect ing it with the commercial world, went west, in obedience to the great movement started by the Pilgrim Fathers, and which was never more vigor ous than to-day, considerable trade stopping here per force, went on east, inflicting some disappoint ment, which, however, soon adjusted itself to the new circumstances in obdience to an instinct which is nowhere so striking as in America, where sur prises, from their frequency, have almost ceased to be surprises at all. The narrow gauge radroad comes into town from the east, and, for a distance of two blocks, runs on Grant Street, the second north of Main; it has a good depot and an elevator, and as the road leaves the village, going west, it is deflected to ward the south, to ultimately reach Spring Grove, which is on the lower tier of towns, to the west. Caledonia has furnished several State officers, and several unsuccessful candidates for State posi tions, among them one for that of governor. The people of the vidage are of a good quality, attend ing to their own affairs. As to society, it has sev eral \"sets\" and the usual number of grades, where the regular conventionalities are observed. It not unfrequently happens that the budd ing of a particular railroad, looked upon with such foftd anticipations, proves to be a temporarv set back to prevailing prosperity, which time can only compensate for by new arrangements, and new de velopments. It was so in California; the comple tion of the Union Pacific railroad, by upsetting values, gave the Pacific coast a most profound commercial shock, that it took years to recover from. THE EARLIEST SETTLEMENT. An absorbing interest is always manifested in regard to the very first pioneer who ventured into any locadty to establish a home, and it would seem that whde the parties who were contemporary with the first settler are still hving, it would not be difficult to promptly arrive at the facts, but for various reasons, which it may not be desirable to state, there is much more uncertainty in this respect than would be supposed by those who have not undertaken to gather this kind of information. It is quite clear, however, that the first person to locate with his family within the limits Caledonia township, was Ralph L. Young, who was said to have been a Mormon elder with Joseph Smith, at Nauvoo, Hlinois. He had a wife and three chd dren, two sons and a daughter. He put up a bark hut in the southern part of the town in 1851. In May, 1852, Anthony Huyck and Peter L. Swartout, a pair of jolly batchelors, made their claim as men tioned elsewhere. A few others had also made their way hither. The village, from its position in the center of a fine farming community, will enjoy a certain amount of trade, if its dealers are prepared to ac commodate it. Looking in another direction, the future pros perity depends largely upon the enterprise of its leading citizens. If competent attention is paid to manufacturing articles required within its com mercial influence, its certain growth and prosper ity is assured. A neglect in this direction will leave the place a slow growing County Seat, du plicating the experience of hundreds of others. In deed the healthy condition of Caledonia to-day is more largely indebted to the limited manufactur ing now carried on here, than most residents would be willing to admit. The population of Caledonia, by the United States census of 1880, was: village, 894; township and village, 1,890; which has not very materially increased since that time. The real founder of Caledonia was Samuel Mc- Phad, who came from Alton, Illinois, in Decem ber, 1851, and located in Wild Cat vadey, as it was caded, about two miles from Brownsville. In March, 1853, he went to where Caledonia now stands and selected a claim, and in June, began active improvements building a httle store and log In 1870, the population by the national census was: native, 1,013; foreign, 615; total, 1,628. In 1860, the whole number in the village and town was 701. These last figures represent what had been done in the eight years since the first settlement of the place."], [364, "350 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. dwelling. This was on Kingston Street, near the place now occupied by the New York House. Dan. Herring and famdy; Hiram Abbey and fam dy, his wife being the daughter of Mr. Armstrong; James Wing, who married Miss Gdlett after coming here; Henry Parmelee, who married an other of Mr. Armstrong's daughters, Margaret, which was one of the earliest weddings in town; Joseph Pendleton, who was also married here to Miss Andrews; John Burns came a bachelor, as many others did, not being certain whether it would be safe to bring a woman here at that time; and Tom. Burns, who lived here until a few years ago, when he went to Dakota and there died; his wife died at an early day. Mr. O. W. Streeter had a store in another place, and also had an interest in this one started by Mc- Phail. The business was afterward in the hands of A. D. Sprague, and finady came into the pos session of Sprague Brothers & Co., who now man age it in a revised and enlarged form. Mr. Wm. F. Dunbar had been here in December, 1852, on a prospecting tour, and being pleased with the ap pearance of the land, had returned to Massachu setts, and induced about forty of his friends to seek new homes in Southern Minnesota. Mr. Dunbar returned in August, 1853. The first in stadment of this party arrived on a steamer, at Brownsville, in the night, and having been com mended to a certain hotel, they made their way to it, to find a log hut, with not standing room enough inside for the party, to say nothing about sleeping room; but they all made the best of the situation, and the next day followed the trail to their future home, Caledonia. The names of a number of this party are here given : Edwin H. Stewart and family, John Dunbar and family, Henry Parmelee, and Michael Mead. Samuel Armstrong came the year before, and Joseph Pen dleton, who was from South Hadley Falls where most of the party were also from, was already here ; he afterward moved to Tennessee. The First Death. \u2014 Mrs. Sarah M. Pomeroy died on the 24th of May, 1854, and it is hkely that her babe was one of the first births in town. Mr. Pomeroy returned to the East after his wife's death. Mrs. Robinson, the daughter of Mr. Webster, died after living here awhile. Mrs. McPhail had a daughter, who was named in honor of the State, which may have been the first child born here; it did not long survive. John J. Dunbar also had a son born, who died in May, 1854. Late in the fall of 1853, there was a social gath ering of the entire community at a candy pud. The whole settlement was there, and they num bered twenty -eight souls. Mr. Henry Bumet and Hugh Brown came late in 1853, but returned, and finady went to Colo rado. Mr. Stewart located on the farm he stid owns, the neighbors ad turned out and helped to lay up a log house, and it was finished on Sunday night, so that they moved in at once. It was 14x24 feet, and at one time they had fifteen in the house for three months, and Mrs. Stewart says there was too much chink ventdation to make that crowding un healthy. During that first winter there were several parties and dances at Mr. James Hiner's, who had arrived and started a hotel where the De Soto House now is. Huyck and Swartout were lo cated where the Burns place now is. The initial log cabin laid up in Caledonia is stdl standing in a lot some distance north of the Methodist church. The greatest trouble at first was the want of water. When the Stewarts went to housekeeping, they had but a two-gallon jug fud. McPhad had loaned them the jug, and gave them the water. On the 25th of October, that year, it began to snow. Mrs. Stewart was alone, with no one to send for water; she was expecting friends, and had but a pint of water in the house. She spread out sheets and table cloths and caught snow to melt, and so bridged over that immediate difficulty. Mr. McPhail had the vidage platted in the the spring of 1854, Mr. Eugene Marshad, the gentlemanly cashier of the Bank, making the sur vey, and doing the other work. The first store actually fided with general mer chandise was that of A. D. Sprague. Reuben Rodins taught the first school in the winter of 1854. Other settlers that came here about this time were: J. W. Finn, who located southeast of Swartout; Jacob Webster, wife and two children, was another famdy, now well known in town; The first remembered preaching was by an old Baptist minister, in an unfinished cabin belonging to Mr. James J. Belden. At that time, deer, bear, and elk, were plentiful,"], [365, "CALEDONIA TOWNSHIP. 351 and there was quite a lively trade kept up with the Winnebago Indians, who had not then left this part of Minnesota. The most noted of the chiefs were Porter, Lightfoot, and his son, Little Priest. But the early settlers here had little or no trouble with the Indians. The virgin soil used to produce thirty-one bush els of wheat to the acre, as one man says, he raised 500 bushels on sixteen acres, which he sold for twenty cents a bushel in the stack. The first threshing machine used by the early comers, was a double affair, composed of two pieces, with an eel-skin attachment between them. It was a one man power, and many of the present generation have never seen one dke it; it was called a flail. The nearest grist-mill was on Canoe Creek, in Iowa, and after reaching there it sometimes cost $10 for 100 pounds of flour. To show the disad vantages under which these people labored, it is related that Mr. McPhail, to get some work done for a plow, went to Prairie du Chein, paid $5.00 steamboat fare, and $2.00 hotel bdls, for sixty cents worth of blacksmith work. But, notwith standing such little drawbacks, the people were happy. Hope was then certainly springing eternal in the breasts of those hardy pioneers, very many of whom to-day, judging from their financial con dition, must have exceeded their youthful expec tations, unless they were unusually extravagant in this direction. Mr. McPhail is now a resident of Alta Vista, Minnesota, but he remembers the scenes of his early triumphs, and his early friends, as an exile remembers his early home and the environments of his early childhood. The earliest settlers had some trepidation as to the Indians, and unusual noises at night would create some alarm. Occasionally a belated traveler would lose the trail, and his shouting to attract at tentio 1 would be taken as the distant reverberations of the sanguinary war whoop. The first comers supposed as a matter of course, that water could be procured at reasonable depths, but it was soon found that a successful well with ordinary digging, was far from being the rule, and building cisterns and making artificial ponds was resorted to for a water supply. On one occasion some new comers borrowed Wm. F. Dunbar's ox team, to haul some water from the creek, just at dark, and, on attempting to return, the party got lost, and Mr. Dunbar started to find them. After venturing as far away as he dared without being lost himself, he succeeded, by vigorous shouting, in making them hear, but it was ten o'clock when they got back. Mr. and Mrs. Charles Metcalf, the latter being Sarah M., the daughter of Edwin H. Stewart, came in the spring of 1854. L. W. Paddock arrived in 1853, from Illinois. His location was west of the town on section four- teen. Nelson Haight located southwest of the town, and had quite a family. Enoch C. Young, and his brother Alphonzo, sons of Ralph L. Young, came here to spy out out the land, and afterwards the family came as above stated. After a time, as the country was settled up west of Houston county, the road through Caledonia became a great thoroughfare, and hundreds of teams were pass- ing through every day, to and from the river. Wheat was often hauled from Albert Lea to Winona, but the expense would sometimes nearly eat up the whole price obtained for the grain. As an instance ; a farmer contracted to have a load of grain teamed to Winona for forty cents a bushel, and on its ar- rival there it sold for forty -five cents a bushel, so the farmer obtained the munificent sum of five cents a bushel for his wheat; which realizes in a striking way the difference between the cost of transportation by animal and steam power, for now a bushel of grain can be carried around the world and still have a moiety of its value left. In the fall of 1854, more of the recruits from New England arrived, and were assisted to make themselves comfortable for the winter. The for eign element began to appear in 1856. The Irish were the first, then came the Norwegians, aud lastly the Germans. It must be remembered that the land was not in the market until 1854, when the first land sale was held in Brownsvdle Ad the settlers were at that time squatters, and realizing their sovereignty, a mutual protective association was organized, and a manager appointed to look after the interests of members, whose duty it was to attend the land sale, and when any section, or fraction therof, was put up, to announce that \"thaLproperty is occupied and has been improved by Mr. so and so, and he will in due time file his claim and attend to the payment for the same.\" This was long before the passage, or rather the enactment of the homestead law, which was vetoed several times in the interest of monopoly before it"], [366, "352 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. finally became operative. The laws were then in the interest of speculators. A man might break up and improve a quarter section, build a dwell ing, barns, and fences, and there was nothing in the law to prevent any one from attending the land sale, or going to the land office and buying it in; and the settlers, to preserve their rights, which in equity they had, banded themselves together, and the penalty for an infraction of their simple rules was, that the offender should be crowded into the Mississippi River. The horde of cormorants who came with the words \"let us prey,\" in every linea ment of their features, very judiciously waited for a more favorable opportunity. Robert Lewis moved here in 1855. He still has the team of horses, twenty-three and twenty- four years of age, respectively, that took himsed and family away at the time of the Indian panic in 1862. At a \"candy pull,\" alluded to elsewhere, there were present : Mr. and Mrs. McPhail, at whose house the sociable took place, Mr. and Mrs. James Hiner, Mr. aud Mrs. J. Dunbar, Anthony Huyck, Peter Swartout, Joseph Pendleton, Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong, Mr. and Mrs. Finn, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart, and Henry Parmelee, with their chil dren and others who were here at the time. It was an enjoyable affair, for the first union gathering, and numerous reunions were held afterward, which afforded rare enjoyment for the settlers, as they relieved the monotony of pioneer hfe. This part of the county was surveyed in 1853-54, and as soon as this was done, each settler, learning the description of his land, and adjusting his boundaries, would file his claim, get a certificate, and in due time have a patent signed by the President of the United States. Amasa Mason came to Caledonia in 1855, and located on section thirty-six. He was originady from New York State. The first religious services held in the neighbor hood of school district No. 39, was at the house of Nelson Haight, in 1855. Prayer meetings were held there for some time, and Rev. John Hooper sometimes held meetings in the neighborhood. The first winter here, Mr. W. F. Dunbar had a yoke of oxen, and let them out to the neighbors to do hauling for their keeping. Mr. J. J. Belden, who has always been a promi nent citizen, came with his family from Connecti cut, arriving at Brownsville on the 10th of April, 1854, on the steamer War Eagle, it behig the first trip up that spring, from Galena, near where they met the steamer Greek Slave, going down. There were eighty persons got off the boat at Brownsville, or Wild Cat Bluff, as the steamboat Captains called it, to locate in various places. There were then about three log cabins there. The party for Caledonia moved in that direction in a procession headed by two ox-teams. Mr. Belden located on section twenty -four and still lives there : the original log-cabin yet remains as a si lent reminder of those early struggles to plant a home in the wilds of Minnesota. Eugene Marshall came to Caledonia in April, 1853. He was the first County Surveyor, and laid out the village. Daniel Hainz came in 1855, and started a boot and shoe shop. Reuben Rollins settled on section thirty-five in 1855. ' Jedediah Pope was here in 1854, and took land in sections thirty-one and thirty-six. Elkana Huyck, from Albany county, New York, came in 1855, and bought 100 acres in section twenty-seven, but did not live on it for ten years or so afterward. Milton B. Metcalf arrived in Caledonia on the 10th of April, 1854. Hugh Brown located on section eleven in 1853. He was a native of Scotland. Charles W. Metcalf was also among the comers of 1854. Daniel Kerr came in 1854, and took a claim on section three. He was originally from Scotland, and had a family of ten children, eight of whom are still dving. Wm. H. Bunce located on section three in 1855. Mr. Bunce acted as agent for Mr. McPhail in sell ing lots, etc. Patrick Jennings came to Caledonia in 1856. Jesse Schofield arrived here in 1856. Henry M. Rollins came to Caledonia in 1855, from New Hampshire. Oliver Dunbar and family came in the spring of 1854. John Burns, a native of Ireland, located on sec tion twenty-two, in 1854, and raised a family of nine chddren. Wells E. Dunbar came in 1854, in Aprd, hav ing landed at Brownsville and walked the weary road with many others."], [367, "CALEDONIA TOWNSHIP. 353 Wm. W. Willis was also an early comer. tended to by the various persons who have had town offices up to the present time. There is no pretense in this volume, of mention ing all the pioneers or early settlers of any town or village, for, naturally, there are many persons who come along with the crowd in a quiet way, and who, on account of their circumspection, never attract particular notice. Not unfrequently large numbers of the best citizens, of those to whom the community is indebted for its prosperity, never have their names before the public. What is de sired here is to give the reader a truthful idea of the settlement and the progress of events up to where we find them now. The officers for 1881, are as follows: Super visors, B. W. Andrews, Chairman; Henry Becker, and C. W. Wheaton; Clerk, Hugh T. Brown; Treasurer, Theodore Schmidt; Assessor, Mathias Schlitz; Justices of the Peace.Patrick Jennings and Reuben Rollins; Constables. Halvor Wisland and Samuel N. Wheaton. VILLAGE ORGANIZATION. Caledonia was organized as a village in accord ance with an act of the State legislature, approved Feb. 25th, 1870 ; and the first election was held on Monday, the 2d of May of the same year. M. M. Wooden and Thomas Abbotts were Judges of Elec tion. At 10 o'clock, N. H. Kemp was chosen moderator, and Nicholas Koob was appointed clerk. At 4 o'clock the polls were closed, and a canvass of the votes showed the whole number cast to be forty-five. Each of the following persons received a unanimous vote for their respective offices: Trustees, D. L. Buell, Thomas Abbotts, and Nich olas Koob ; Justice of the Peace, M. M. Wooden ; Treasurer, T. W. Burns. The trustees appointed Nicholas Murphy as Vdlage Clerk. Michael Lady was appointed Surveyor of Highways. Hon. D. L. Buell was appointed President of the board of trustees. THE FIRST SCHOOLHOUSE. The First attempt to build a schoolhouse was on Belden's Hill. Mr. Dunbar, Mr. Belden, and others in the fall of 1854, commenced the erection of a log building in their neighborhood, and got it ready for the roof, when Mr. McPhail and others, with an eye to securing every advantage for the embryotic village, made a proposition which was favorably received, to build a schoolhouse in the edge of the village, toward the Dunbar place. So the schoolhouse was built there, and it served a good purpose until about 1864, when it was re moved to make room for the present structure. The old budding is still in existence as the brown house nearly opposite Sprague's hardware store. The first ordinance was in relation to drunken ness and disorderly conduct, fixing the penalty be tween five and twenty dollars. The second ordi nance related to licenses, fixing the fee at $40. The third related to the obstruction of streets. The fourth, to the hitching of horses, oxen, or other draft animals to trees, gates or fences. The fifth provided a pound, and the sixth regulated the lay ing down of sidewalks. THE FIRST MARRIAGE. The question is whether James H. Williams and Martha Hiner, or Henry Parmelee and Miss Mag gie Armstrong were married first. Both couples were married before the county organization, and it matters little which is given priority. TOWN ORGANIZATION. The initial meeting to organize the town, took place on the 11th of May 1858. It was called to order by Samuel McPhail. Nelson Haight was chosen moderator, and Eugene Marshall, clerk. The whole number of votes cast at that election was 126. The officers elected were : Supervisors, Stephen Bugbee, Chairman; John Dorsch, and Oliver Dunbar; Town Clerk, Truman B. Neff; As sessor, William McGinnis; Justices of the Peace, Thomas Abbott and J. Webster; Collector, Wm. W. Wdlis; Overseers of the Poor, Samuel Arm strong and Jedediah Pope; Road Supervisors, James H. Williams and Peter L. Swartout. This brings the village around to near the end of its first year, when it began to feel metropolitan and no more ordinances were passed until more than two years afterwards. Various ordinances have since been passed, however, some amended, and some repealed. The whole number, consecu tively arranged, comes up to thirty-three. At the second election, in the spring of 1871, the following persons were elected: D. L. Buell, President; N. Koob, and N. E. Dorival, Trustees, and James O'Brien, Vdlage Clerk. In 1872, the officers were: D. L. Buell, Presi dent; Joseph Vossen and Nicholas Arnoldy, Trus- The affairs of the town have been carefully at- 23"], [368, "354 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. tees; N. Koob, Treasurer; C. A. Coe, Assessor ; M. M. Wooden, Justice of the Peace; N. H. Kemp, Constable, and E. W. Trask, Clerk. opened at 10 o'oclock, A. M., and closed at 4 o'clock P. M., and the result of the election was as follows: whole number of votes deposited, 184; 103 in the affirmative and 71 in the negative. So the proposition, \"Shad bonds be issued,\" was de clared duly carried. In January, 1873, Mr. E. W. Trask resigned as Vdlage Clerk, and N. E. Dorival was elected in his place. The vidage license was raise to $50; and additional restrictions enacted. On the 6th of March, 1873, a petition was presented to the vidage board, asking that a special election be held to vote on the question of issuing bonds to assist in the construction of a Court Couse, for the use of the county. The petition was signed by, Thomas Abbotts, Wm. McGinnis, Nicholas Koob, N. E. Dorival, James O'Brien, Daniel Hainz, Peter Rob erts, D. C. Sprague, J. Scofield, and A. D. Sprague. An election was accordingly ordered for the 17th of March, when the following ques tion was voted on : At the regular election on the 5th of Aprd, 1875, the following were the successful candidates: Trustees, J. H. Cooper, Joseph Vossen, and J. J. Belden; Village Clerk, Thomas Ryan, Jr.; Treas urer, Nicholas Koob ; Assessor, John Aiken; Con stable, J. B. Davidson. In 1875, several stone cross walks were laid by order of the board. At one time a well was sunk at the junction of Marshall and Main streets, and a pump applied to be worked by a windmdl. It was in operation for some time with more or less success, but on ac count of the expense involved by frequent repairs, necessitated by the great distance the water had to be raised, it was finady abandoned. Yes or No. \"Issue of bonds to aid in the erec tion of county buildings.\" The sum was not to exceed $5,000. The result of the election was 90 votes, all in favor of issuing the bonds. A formal proposition was then made to the county board, to donate this amount on condition that the build ings should be commenced at once and not to cost less than $15,000. On the 25th of March, 1876, a proposition was made by Oliver Dunbar to have the board pur chase a Fire Engine at a cost of $283.82, but nothing came of it. At the election on the 3d of April, 1876, the following persons were chosen as vidage officers: Trustees, J. J. Belden, Walter Goergen, and Jos eph Vossen; Treasurer, Nicholas Koob; Assessor, T. W. Burns ; Justices of Peace, O. J. Weida and M. M. Wooden; Village Clerk, Thomas Ryan, Jr.; Constable, S. W. Walker. Tlds was an unevent ful year, the most noticeable thing in the proceed ings of the board being adowances for sidewalks, and bids for the repair of the windmdl and pump. The Caledonia and Mississippi Railroad Com pany, through the friends of the enterprise, peti tioned the board to order a special election, to see if the Village would aid the construction of the road by voting bonds to the amount of $12,000. And in response to this request an election was or dered, and held on the 11th of March, 1874. There must have been considerable interest in the proposition, as the whole number of votes cast were 143, of which, 124 voted for the proposition, and some of the minority voted on a modified plan. So the proposition was declared carried. * In 1877, the election was on the 2d of April. The officers elected were : Trustees, Joseph Vos sen, J. J. Belden, and A. J. Flynn; Treasurer, Nicholas Koob: Assessor, James McMahon; Clerk, Thomas Ryan, Jr. ; Constable, D.C. Thompson. On the 27th of April, C. A. Coe was appointed Village Clerk in place of Mr. Ryan, who had removed from the vdlage. This year the Pound was re moved to a lot purchased by the village. A peti tion was received on the 14th of August, 1877, signed by leading citizens, asking for an appro priation to sink an artesian well, and a special election was held to determine whether a tax amounting to $3,000, to defray the expense of sinking a well, should be assessed. The result of the balloting was 35 votes in favor and fifty At the elected on the 6th of April, 1874, the fol lowing persons were elected village officers : Trus tees, Thomas Abbotts, Jacob Bouquet, and Jos eph Vossen; Village Clerk, Thomas Ryan, Jr. ; Treasurer, N. Koob; Justice of the Peace, O. J. Weida; Constable, H. K. Belding. In the fall of 1874, the Trustees made a vigor ous attempt to secure water by sinking wells. Another proposition was made on the 17th of March, 1875, to further aid the Ctledonia and Mississippi railroad, by voting $8,000 additional. The question was submitted to the legal voters of the Vidage on the 30th of March. The polls were"], [369, "CALEDONIA TOWNSHIP. 355 against. So the proposition was rejected. On the 5th of January, 1878, the hcense fees tion being thirty-one. The proposition being carried, the bonds were accordingly issued. The authority for this action was found in an act of the State legislature, approved March 4th, 1875. Authority was given the company to occupy Grant and other streets necessary to get into town. were fixed at $100, payable half yearly in advance. On the 21st of January, 1878, the trustees adopted a resolution that: Unless the Caledonia and Mis sissippi railroad should be completed by the 25th of January, 1879, that the bonds voted for that purpose, to the aggregate amount of $20,000, should be forfeited, and the company was so notified. At the election held on the 5th of Aprd, 1880, the following gentlemen were duly elected : Trus tee, Joseph Vossen, President; W. H. Bunce, and Daniel Hainz; Clerk, A. J. Flynn; Treasurer, N. Koob; Assessor, N. H. Kemp; Justice of the Peace, C. S. Trask; Constables, N. Weigand and G. A. Lindley. In March, 1878, W. C. Pidge was employed to resurvey the vdlage plat,to establish boundaries at the street crossings, and make a complete map of the vidage, for the sum of $110, to be completed by the first of May. In the spring of 1881, it was determined to set aside two-thirds of the license money received, toward paying the indebtedness for railroad bonds, and accordingly, the fees for selling spiri tuous and malt liquors was raised from $50 to $100 per year, and as there were fourteen hcenses granted, this realized quite a sum as a sinking fund. At the village election held on the first of April, 1878, the following persons, having received the largest number of votes, were declared duly elect ed as village officers: Trustees, James J. Belden, P. J. Pallen, and Michael Lady; Clerk, A. J. Flynn; Assessor, Walter Goergen; Justices of the Peace, O. J. Weida and Wm. Weigand; Treasurer, N. Koob; Constable, J. P. Bessen. The election in 1881, was on the 6th of April, and the officers elected were : Trustees, Joseph Vossen, President, D. L. Buell, and W. H. Bunce; Treasurer, N. Koob; Clerk, A. J. Flynn; Assessor, N. H. Kemp ; Justices of the Peace, J. Vossen and C. S. Trask; Constable, J. P. Bessen;. Little of public interest has been transacted up to January, 1882, where our record closes. On the 28th of December, the resignation of J. J. Belden, as president of the board, and trustee, was accepted, and Charles A. Coe was appointed to fid the vacancy. A petition with eighty-three signatures was presented asking that the time for building the railroad, to secure the village aid, be extended, which was unanimously refused. At the April election in 1879, the whole number of votes cast was 185, and the following persons duly elected: Trustees, J. C. Keirn, President, S. Williams and Jesse Scofield; Clerk, A. J. Flynn; Treasurer, N. Koob; Assessor, N. H. Kemp; Con stable, John C. Bessen. SCHOOLS. The schools of Caledonia village are in old Dis trict No. 42, of the county system, which was or ganized into an independent district in 1880, pre vious to which time the schools were under county supervision and were well up to the requirements as county schools usually go. The first attempt at building a schoolhouse was made on Belden's Hid, as has already been stated. Mr. J. J. Belden donated the lot for the purpose, and the logs were laid up ready for the roof, meantime,however,a log house was built in the town, so that the budding southwest of the town was never completed for that purpose. About 1864, anew building was constructed where it now stands, opposite the Pres byterian Church. Before the old one was torn down, it had to receive, it could hardly be said to accommodate, llOpupds.three being often crowded into a seat designated for two. But as that was during the war, and they had a patriotic teacher, Mrs. Sheldon, who encouraged military drilling by At a meeting of the village board, held on the 12th of May, 1879, a petition was presented, signed by twenty of the leading citizens, asking that another election be held to see whether the village would issue bonds to the amount of $20,- 000, to aid in the completion of the Caledonia and Mississippi railroad. The conditions being that the road shall be running to a point west of Kingston street by the 1st of October, 1879. The bonds to be executed and placed in escrow in the hands of D. L. Bued. An election was accord ingly ordered for the 23d day of May, 1879.

The board of education subsequently organ ized, D. L. Buell was made President, and A. J. Flynn, Clerk of the board; E. P. Dorival was elected Treasurer, Various committees were ap pointed, and the school machinery set in motion. It was found that the number of scholars in the primary department of the public schools was sixty-eight, average attendance, forty-four, seat ing capacity, forty-eight. In the intermediate department, total number of scholars, seventy two, average attendance, forty-six, seating capac ity, sixty. In the grammer school, the average attendance was twenty-eight, seating capacity, forty-six. The first teacher was Reuben Rollins, in the store first built by O. W. Streeter or Mr. McPhail, it was a mere log cabin, on Kingston Street. The schoolhouse was built in the fall of 1854, and Truman B. Neff was one of the early teachers, and Miss Satah McNedy followed. In 1857 or '58, Mr. David M. Farr opened a private school. Mr. Farr was a Sleight-of-hand performer, a pro fessor of legerdemain, of an itinerant turn, he after wards went west, and it is understood located in Moscow, Mower county. To give a list of those who taught, up to the time the village was organized as an indepen dent District, would be to present quite a galaxy of names, and it would embrace some of the best ladies in town, the leaders in society at the pres ent time, as well as others who have joined the procession that is marching away never to return. At a meeting held on the 3d of Aprd, 1880, Mrs. J. S. Kilbourne, Miss Florence Bunce, and G. J. Lomen, were appointed on the board of examiners. On the 14th of April, A. H. Belding was appoint ed Principal of the public schools for the remain ing term of the school year. The Independent school district was inaugurated in this way: On the 25th of February, 1880, a notice was posted, requesting the voters of the district to assemble at the schoolhouse on the 8th of March, to determine whether, in accordance with Chapter 36 of the general statutes of 1878, an Independent district should be organized. The notice was in conformity to law, and was signed by O. J. Weida, A. D. Sprague, Daniel Hainz. A. J. Flynn, C. W. Metcalf, D. G. Sprague, and W. H. Harries. The legal voters of the district ac cordingly convened. W. H. Harries, Esq., called the meeting to order, when E. P. Dorival was elected Chairman, and A. J. Flynn was appointed Clerk. After the object of the meeting had been stated by the chairman, Mr. Harries read the law applicable to the case, and recommended the for mation of an Independent school organization. Prof. A. H. Belding coincided with this view in a few pointed remarks, deprecating the State law in relation to books, and expressing dissatisfaction with their quality as furnished. The final result of the balloting was twenty-two for the proposition aud twelve against, so the plan was adopted. At a meeting on the 17th of April, Miss Fannie E. Dunbar was appointed teacher of the interme diate school for the ensuing term, and Miss Fannie Lapham was appointed teacher of the primary department. The salaries were fixed as follows: Mr. Belding $55.00, and the ladies $35.00 per month. At the commencement of the next school term, it was voted, on the 31st of July, to employ four teachers, and A. H. Belding was afterwards ap pointed as Principal, and Miss Josephine A. McCan, Miss Eva Burns, and Miss Mary E. Anderson as assistants. The annual meeting of the independent district was held on the 4th of September, 1880. J. J. J. Belden was moderator. The report of the board was received. E. P. Dorival and A. J. Flynn were elected directors for three years. At a meeting in December, the school property was ordered insured for the sum of $1,200 on building and furniture. At a meeting in March, it was concluded to hire the academy for $150.00 per year. The board of education, at a meeting held on the 16th of July, 1881, appointed the following teachers: Miss Fannie E. Dunbar, Primary; Miss Emma Randolph, Second intermediate; Miss L. L. Wilder, First intermediate; Miss Josephine McCan, Grammar department. The salaries were The second meeting, to complete the organiza tion, was held on the 20th of March, when W. H. Harries was Chairman, and A. H. Belding, Clerk. The following board of Directors was elected: to serve three years, W. H. Harries and P. J. Smadey ;"], [371, "CALEDONIA TOWNSHIP. 357 adjusted as follows: Grammar and First interme diate, $40 per month; Second intermediate and Primary, $35. W. D. Belden was appointed a member of the examining board. Green, in John Burns' house, on section twenty three. In 1869, Mr. C. Madrid taught in the house of Mr. Bugbee, on section fourteen. Schools No. 35 and 36, were the outcome of school started in 1856 ,or '57, on a log house on section eleven, where it was kept up until the win ter of 1873, when two houses were put up, No. 35, on section eleven, and the other. No. 36, was budt soon after on section nine. Mr. L. D. Churchill was among the first teachers in the log houses. At the annual school meeting in September, 1881, D. L. Buell and W. E. Dunbar were elected directors for the term of three years. A meeting of the board in September appointed A. H. Belding and G. J. Lomen, members of the board of exam iners. D. L. Buell was made President; E. P. Dorival, Treasurer, A. J. Flynn, Clerk. In Decem ber, 1881, the salary of Miss McCan, in the Gram mer school was increased to $45 per month. Quite a full account of the transactions of the board of education has been thus presented, for present as well as prospective info rmation as to school affairs, in the closing quarter of the nineteenth century, that has beeu so productive in new methods. In addition to what has been mentioned as having been done by the board since the new departure, a different series of books have been introduced as fast as possible, new charts have been ordered, and the most improved plans adopted. And if the people continue to second the motions of the board, the schools will continue to be objects of pride to the whole community. , Dcstrict No. 38. The schoolhouse was built in 1871. District No. 71. This house was budt about the same time. The history of these districts is not unlike, in the principal features, that of all the others. We have at first a necessity for a school, and a firm re solve to meet the requirements, and then the best make-shdt for a place and the best teacher availa ble, and as the ability of the people grows, school houses are provided. CALEDONIA ACADEMY. This was an institution which, during its ten years of active existence, performed useful and val uable work. The Academy building was erected in 1869, by Rev. W. R. Powell, who conducted a school for one year, but not receiving sufficient patronage to meet the expenses, he gave it up and left the place. His successor in the pastorate of the Episcopal Church, then took charge of the school for about one year, when, as it did not meet his expecta tions, it was again abandoned. In the fall of 1871, and the winter of 1872, Mr. E. W. Trask took hold of the enterprise. In the autumn of 1872, Prof. W. D. Belden, a young gentlemen of education, energy, and enterprise, assumed the management of the institution, and proceeded to organize an academy in accordance with the requirements of the times. A regular course of study was pre scribed for four years, or, to be more exact, there were two courses, a practical one, where the stu dent desired to have this end his school education, and a classical one for those who expected to en ter a collegiate course, particular reference being had to the State University, this Ac j demy being a connecting link between the common school and the University, which at that time was unprovided for by the State. The instruction given would en able the student to receive a first-class teacher's certificate. OTHER DISTRICTS IN THE TOWNSHIP. School No. 33 is the outcome of the original dis trict No. 6. The first school taught was in the log house of Nelson Haight, on section twenty-eight, in the fall of 1859. The teacher was Mrs. Mary Whea ton, now Mrs. M. L. Brigham. The next school was in the house of G. N. Thompson, just west of Flynn's stone house, on section thirty-three. In the summer of 1861, the teacher was Laura V. Haight. The next school was in Thompson's stone house. The school house of this district is on sec tion twenty -seven; was erected in 1863, and has a comfortable seating capacity of fifty. The first school within its walls was presided over by Wm. Conniff, in the winter of 1863-64. About 1877, the German Catholics had a schoolhouse in which sev eral terms were held.. The first school in district No. 40, was at the house of Reuben Rodins. The district was estab lished in 1859. The second school was in the house of J. Pope. The school house was built in 1863. District No. 21. The house was built in 1870. In 1866, there was a school in a log house on sec tion twenty-two, Miss Margaret Murphy was the teacher. In 1868, a school was kept by Mr."], [372, "358 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. The school went on with considerable success until 1875, when the building was thoroughly re paired and improved, at an expense of about $1, 000. The school was supplied with Camp's out line maps, Cutter's physiological charts, a tele scope of sufficient power to show the rings of Sat urn, the moons of Jupiter, and the mountains on the moon, with a planetarium, a twelve inch globe, and other valuable implements. Many of the graduates of the Academy taught school in the county and elsewhere, while several went to the State University. . POST-OFFICE. The Post-office in Caledonia was first estabhshed in 1854. Before that time the settlers had to send to Brownsvide for their mail, and any one going over was expected to bring what mail matter hap pened to be there. The arrival of the first mad bag was siezed upon by the restive citizens as a suitable occasion for a jollification, and an improvised programme was carried out, with volunteer pieces thrown in, to till the measure of the impromptu hilarity. It was estabdshed as a money order office on the 9th of September, 1867. Wells E. Dunbar was Postmaster. The first money order issued was to John O'Connor, on the 9th of November, 1867, for the sum of $10, payable to D. C. Cameron, of La Crescent. The second was issued to Albert H. Belding, for the sum of $10.71, payable to Root & Cady, Chicago. During that month eight orders were issued. In October, twenty-nine were sold, and in October, 1868, the number was fifty. The attendance was quite large, the number in 1878 being fifty-five. Of course the number com pleting the fud four years course would be small. The first commencement was held in 1877, when the following class graduated with honor. H. F. Arnold, Wilmington; Eva S. Belden, Cal edonia; Hellen B. Coe, Caledonia; H. P. Shuni way, Wilmington; M. J. Taylor, May vide. The class of 1878 was: Frances V. Burns, Cale donia; Evangeline P. Burns, Caledonia; Hattie H. Dunbar, Caledonia; Fannie P. Lapham, Win nebago; M. T. McGinnis, Wdmington; Samantha L. Wright, Wilmington. On the 16th of May, 1872, the key to open the new locks, just introduced, was received and re ceipted for to the department by John Dorsch. The number of the key, which is stid in use in the office, is 58,338. In the class of 1879, were Charles E. Heath, Fred. A. Wright, Fred. R. Williams. In the class of 1880, were Miss Jennie Gibbs, and Gilbert Drowley. The business of the money order department kept on increasing untd the estabdshment of the Bank of Caledonia, when it began to fad off, although a large business is stid done in this branch of the office. The sales of stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal cards amount to from $400 to $460 per month. At this time, there being public schools inter mediate between the district and the University, the school was discontinued, and the building is now used for a public school. During the time the Academy was under the charge of Prof. Belden, the following named assist ant teachers were employed for longer or shorter periods: Miss Larkie Lapham, Mrs. White, Miss, Kate Rudolph, and Miss Eva S. Belden. The members of the learned professions in town, and the leading citizens, were interested in its success. Dr. Castle, W. H. Harries, Esq., P. J. Smadey and others, dehvered addresses in connection with the commencement exercises on the various occasions. This collegiate institute, whde it remained in active Operation, was an honor to its founders aud to its principal, a matter of pride to the citizens, and an Alma Mater not to be ashamed of by its alumni. The building was not without architectural pretensions, being of a modern style. It is in a good location, in the rear of the Episcopal Church, and is well adapted to school purposes. In the absence of the early records, and from early recollection, the dst of those who have been Postmasters in the Caledonia office is here given, as nearly as can be ascertained: Samuel McPhail, William McKee, Peter H. Thomas, A. S. Lindsey, R. S. Williams, C. G. Ward, J. G. Prentiss, H. K. Belding, John Dorsch, Wells E. Dunbar, 0. G. Wall, John Dorsch, again, and O. E. Comstock. The above list must be approximately correct, although it is possible that James Wertz and John B. Nets should be added to the list. Among the quite large number of old settlers who were consulted as to the postmasters, no two agreed. This is mentioned to show the difficulty of pro curing accurate information in the absence of record evidence."], [373, "CALEDONIA TOWNSHIP. 359 CHURCHES. The third quarterly meeting was held at Port _ land Prairie, and in 1856, Mr. Hooper was returned with an adowance of $100 for the coming year. Mr. Hooper was reported as being a successful preacher, although not particularly so in Cale- donia. At the quarterly meeting in April, 1857, Mr. N. Haight and Robert Lewis were appointed a committee to obtain subscriptions toward a fund to build a parsonage. Samuel McPhail donated two lots for a church and parsonage, and in the fad of 1859, the house was so far finished as to be occupied. Methodist Episcopal Church. \u2014 As early as 1854, the Rev. Mr. Wing, an exploring missionary, visited this lecality and held a meeting in the log cabin of Mr. James Belden, a half-mile southwest of the town. After the second meeting in the same place, a class was organized embracing the following members: Lewis Herring, John Pad dock and wife, Nelson Haight and wife, H. M. Phelps and wife, Daniel Cook and wife, Samuel Armstjong and wife, and Lucy Stewart. Mr. Phelps was appointed leader. Soon after this. Rev. Benj. Crist was appointed to Brownsville, and he preached several times here, finding little encour agement. His meetings were held in a log house used as a tavern by James Hiner. It was after wards used as a blacksmith shop. Rev. J. L. Dyer succeeded Mr. Hooper in 1857. He was an elderly man, with a rough exterior and much earnestness as a preacher. He had been a lead miner at Galena, Hlinois, and engaged ex tensively in revival work; his habit being to visit every famdy in the place, and by personal effort endeavor to awaken a religious interest. At the end of a year he wended his way west, with the hope of discovering pastures new, where a more abundant harvest would be the reward of his la bors. The next year, 1855, the first conference of the Methodist church was held, aud the towns of Cale donia, Brownsvdle, and Hokah, were designated as the Caledonia circuit. Subsequently it was enlarged by the addition of Hacket's Ridge, Pope's Prairie, Winnebago Val ley, and Portland Prairie, which points became appointments in the same charge. Rev. E. Haight was here a year, in 1858 and '59. He was also an elderly men, and lived a short distance from Caledonia with Mr. Swartout. Rev. J. Cowden followed in the spring of '59, and he resided in Money Creek. Of course all these min isters were on the circuit, which embraced several appointments. In 1860, there was a short confer ence year, caused by a change in the date of the conference from the spring to the fall, and for this brief term Rev. Mr. Edingwood was the pastor. In the fall, Rev. Mr. Wended came and remained one year. In 1861, Rev. Nahum Taintor, a mid dle aged gentleman, came, and was here until the fall of 1863, and then came Rev. Mr. White, who stayed three years, the full period allowed by the denomination. Succeeding him, in the fall of 1866, was the Rev. John W. Klepper, who infused new life into Methodism here. He was a worker and speaker, and his being here marked an epoch in the history of the church in Caledonia, by the budding of the edifice and sohdifying the congre gation. Brownsville, Hackets Ridge, and Winne bago Vadey, were dropped one after another. Portland Prairie, being the only other appoint ment, services were held every Sunday in each place. At the end of two years, in the fad of 1868, Rev. James Door, a native of New York, succeeded him and remained one year, when Rev. A. M. Ste- The first regular assignment to the charge was Rev. John Hooper, who was adowed by the con ference the sum of $50, as from the reports of the itinerants who had visited the places, the mission would prove far from self supporting, and the ex periment confirmed the unpromising character of the field in a pecuniary view. Mr. Hooper was a painstaking and industrious minister. The first quarterly meeting held in Caledonia was in the house of Mr. Phelps, in October, 1855. Rev. Norris Hobart was the presiding elder. Rev. Mr. Hooper was present, and Ransom Scott, an enthusiastic exhorter, was also in attendance. H. M. Phelps was class leader. The minister reported that he had received in contributions the sum of fifty cents, and his traveling expenses had amounted to $17, which had been taken from the $50 allowed him as a missionary. At this meeting a board of stewards was elected as fodows: Lewis Herring, Nelson Haight, and Oreb Parker, with H. M. Phelps as recording steward, which place he held several years. Hokah was an important part of the conference at that time, and at the second quarterly meeting, which was held there, that society had paid $20 or the support of preaching."], [374, "360 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. vens, a Virginian, was assigned to the charge, but before the year was through, his voice failed, and the pulpit was transiently filled until fall, when Rev. Linderman Wright, of Ohio, came, remaining one year. In the fall of 1871, there came a young man just from a Theological school, Rev. Henry C. Jennings, who became popular, and did con siderable revival work. He remained two years. The next minister was Rev. Aaron Matson, of Ohio, an elderly gentleman who was here two years. The parsonage was built during his term. Hokah had disbanded, and Mrs. J. S. Prentiss and Miss Ruth Prentiss, of Spring Grove, were receiv ed into the church here. At this meeting Elizabeth Smith was admitted by examination, and Mrs. James Frothingham by letter. At a meeting on the 9th of January 1864, Mr. D. L. Buell and Mrs. Harriet Buell were admitted to membership. The church was budt in 1864, and is a neat structure, on South Street, near Ramsey. Mr. Craig preached until 1866, when Rev. Wm. T. Hendren was installed as pastor, remaining until 1872. Rev. Mr. Radcliffe was here awhde, then followed Rev. Mr. James for about two years, then the Rev. Wm. G. Westervelt, who remained until October, 1880, and since that time there has been no settled minister. The Sunday-school is still kept up. The years 1875 and '76 were without a pastoral appointment here. About this time the people of Portland Prairie succeeded in building a church. Rev. W. M. Bowdish was stationed in Caledo nia in the fad of 1876, and remained two years. In 1878, Rev. W. A. Miles succeeded him, remain ing one year. Rev. A. P. Bunce was located here in 1878, and still remains. The church is on the corner of Grant and Kingston streets. William D. Belden is Superintendent, and D. T. Buell has charge of the Bible class. Miss Fan nie E. Dunbar is organist. During the existence of the Society, about fifty persons were admitted as members, and according to the revised list there were twenty-three mem bers when the last pastor severed his relations with it. The record reveals thirteen marriages sol emnized by the several pastors. With a pastor in charge, the Society now seems to possess the ele ments of prosperity. The Sunday school was at first a union school, the various denominations joining in its exercises, and assisting in carrying it on, but after a time it became distinctively a Methodist school, and so continued up to the spring of 1863, when it again became a union school. After the church was built it resumed its place as an auxiliary to the church, and has kept on to the present time with varying interest in its operations. ROMAN CATHOLIC. The two churches, Caledonia and Portland Prai rie, which are under one charge, now number fifty members, thirty in Caledonia and twenty at Port land Prairie. In 1874, there were sixty-five active members in Portland Prairie, and fifty-one in Cale donia. The loss has been from removals more than any other cause. St. John the Baptist. \u2014 This is the elder of the two Catholic societies in Caledonia, and there are perhaps 150 families attending upon its ministra tions. The edifice is capacious, and occupies a whole square, with Washington Street in front, South Street in the rear, and Kingston and Deco rah Streets on either side. The present pastor is Rev. Father Shanahan, who has a residence near the county buildings on Marshall Street. The Presbyterian CHURCH.^This society was organized on the 17th of May, 1863, by Rev. James Frothingham. Rev. E. W. Rice, a missionary, was also present. The meeting was held at the court house. The fodowing persons handed in their letters from other societies : Mr. Peter H. Thomas, Mrs. Frances Thomas, Mr. John Craig, Mrs. Elizabeth Craig, and Mr. S. Jefferson. Miss Emily Pope passed an examination. John Craig was appointed an Elder of the Presbyterian church, and was ordained on the 26th of June, 1863. At a meeting on the 27th of June, Miss Endly Pope was received into the church, with Miss Sarah Hazeltine. It seems that a church in The building now occupied by the church was erected during the earlier years of the war, the Rev. Charles Koeberl being the resident priest at the time. The earliest meetings in town must have been held in 1855, when itinerant mis sionaries from Wisconsin, and perhaps Winona, visited the settlement, and held mass at private houses; the first of these remembered was Mi chael Pendergast. A small place of worship was erected, which soon gave place to the present church building. Rev. Father F. Essing was the first regular priest here, and he was followed by"], [375, "CALEDONIA TOWNSHIP. 361 Rev. Mathew Sturenberg, who was famiharly called Father Mathew ; Rev.

The first manufacturing estabdshment that claims our attention is that of Thomas Abbotts, who has a steam engine and other machinery for the manufacture of wagons, drays, buggies, sleighs, and other carriage work. He also manufactures cultivators and other farm machinery. Mr. Abbotts is also an extensive dealer in agricultural machin ery and implements. His place is on Main Street, on the north side, but with an office on the oppo site side of the street. RAILROAD BUSINESS. The present official name of the railroad is, \"The Preston branch of the Dubuque Division of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Radroad.\" [Narrow Gauge.] This road has about ad it can do with its present equipment. Of course the capacity of a road is not limited or measured by the gauge, but by the amount of rolling stock. FLOURING MILL. In 1855, a saw-mill was budt by Armstrong and Curry ,in the northwestern part of the township, on Beaver Creek, near the center of section five. It was a primitive affair with a single up and down frame saw. Two or three years later a grist mid was added, with a single run of stones. In 1867, Mr. John Blinn bought the grist mid, the saw mid by this time having disappeared, and the next year put in another run of stones. He thus run it until 1875, when he budt a fine stone mill, 34x54 feet, three stories high, and placed four run of stones in it, three for flour and one for corn and feed, also one purifier, one separator, one smutter, one corn shelter, and other machinery. The power is obtained by two feet of head and two turbine wheels. It manufactures twenty-five barrels a day. The total amount of freight received in 1880 was 2,911,206 pounds. The amount forwarded was 4,884,460 pounds. This was at the Caledonia station alone. The outgoing freight in 1881, was 4,408,900 pounds; incoming freight for the same year, 2,465,300. The amount of passenger fares received, the agent was not at hberty to furnish. The road was opened for business, October 1, 1879, Mr. C. E. Lyman was appointed agent, and he stdl remains. He is also agent of the Amer can express company, that does a business here of $1,500 a year. THE ELEVATOR. An elevator, holding 20,000 bushels, was built at the railroad station in the fall of 1881. It was opened for business by A. & T. McMichael of McGregor, Iowa, on the 25th of September, 1881. George McMichael is the local agent. Wheat, corn, barley, rye, and oats are purchased, as well as hogs. The amount of grain purchased up to the 25th of December, the first three months of its existence, aggregated 167,600 bushels, the prices paid being wed up to the market for like grades. The budding cost about $3,500, and has a single horse power. This elevator takes the place of one burned on the 12th of July, 1881. PRESENT BUSINESS ENTERPRISES.

As to the amount of capital, enough is used to be profitably employed in that way, and the respon sibility of the bank is only limited by the individ ual and collective wealth of the owners; and to speculate in that regard would leave the question all unsettled, but as the philosophical Mercrutio remarked \"it will suffice.\" LUMBER DEALERS.

Bingham, one of the early settlers of this place, was born in Westport, Essex county, New York, on the 3d of February. 1839. His parents removed to Chautauqua county when the subject of this sketch was quite young. After at taining manhood, he engaged in farming and lum bering. He came to Caledonia in 1856, but did not purchase land until 1866, when he located his present farm in section twenty-six. On the 13th of June of the latter year, Miss Mary Wheaton became his wife.

Of three children born of the latter marriage, two are living, Joseph A. and Mary K. Thomas Messerall is a native of Adegany county, New York, where his birth occurred the 9th of April, 1824. In about 1832, his parents moved to Pennsylvania, where- they resided on a farm. It was a custom of Mr. Messerall' s to spend about two months of the fall and winter, hunting, and when Thomas became old enough he accom panied him, thus affording themselves much sport, and many times they were wed repaid for the time by money received for the skins and carcasses of their game. He was married at the age of twen ty-two years to Miss Rose Daniels, of Pennsyl vania. They moved to Idinois, remaining a few years, and in 1853, came to Caledonia, locating a farm in section six. He at once put up a shanty which he occupied two years, then erected his present residence, the old one being used for a schoolhouse for a time, and now serves him for a barn. Mrs. Messerall died in August, 1856, leav ing five children. In 1863, he married Miss Agnes Kelly, who came from Scotland to Boston with her parents in 1851, and thence to Yucatan, in 1861.

CHAPTER LIT. and the day is not far distant when, in no other por tion of the State, the same in extent of territory, wid be more intimately blended the interests of manufacture and agriculture. GENERAL DESCRIPTION FIRST SETTLEMENT FIRST BIRTH MARRIAGE DEATH TOWN ORGANIZA- TION SCHOOLS MANUFACTURES RELIGIOUS NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL CURIOSITIES ROBBERS' ROOST FREEBURG VILLAGE\u2014 CALEDONIA JUNC- TION BIOGRAPHICAL. Crooked Creek is a stream coming into the town from the west, toward the northern part, and mak ing its tortuous way to the slough on the eastern side of the town. Another small stream, with a valley seemingly out of proportion to its size, joins the creek from the southwest. Springs along the bluffs are not uncommon. This is one of the river towns of Houston county, the second above the Iowa line, with the river Mississippi on the east, Jefferson on the south, May vide on the west, and Brownsville on the north. In size it is somewhat smaller than a government township. The whole surface of the town is rough, that is, made up of valleys and ridges with their connect ing bluffs. The sod in the vadeys is remarkably good, as is that on the top of the ridges, and, al though most of these are narrow, they contain good farms. To one accustomed to a level and even country, that part of Houston county lying along the Mis- sissppi and Root Rivers may present a rugged and forbidding appearance, as nothing appears to meet the eye save the rocky hills and the heavy growth of timber. This line of bluffs generally extends back into the country from two to four mdes, and there is to be found fine prairie and timber land, gently rolling, while a few miles further west the surface of the country is often a plain \u2014 perfectly level. In the valleys between these high bluffs the land is quite as good for farming purposes as the prairies, and the convenience of springs vastly better, as there is scarcely a valley in the county but has an abundant supply of clear and whole- some water. About one-sixth of the county, we estimate, consists of these bids and bluffs, about one- fourth of timber, and the remaining portion well adapted to the growth of grain, and advan- tageous for the raising of stock of ad kinds. It is between the ranges of bluffs that are to be found the large number of water-powers of which this county can boast, and which offer such fine oppor- tunities for a number and class of manufactures unsurpassed by any other in the Western States. No part of Southern Minnesota offers a greater number of available sites for mill seats than this; Inside of the Mississippi is a slough, into which Crooked Creek enters; it is called Minnesota Slough. It is a branch, leaving the main river opposite Fairy Rock, near the northwest corner of section twenty-five, and flows south through sec tions twenty-five, thirty-five, and two, and thence into Jefferson. The land east of the Mississippi bluff's is marshy, and fit only for some varieties of timber, and for hay. There is an abundance of wood all through the town, mostly oak, with birch and maple. In relation to the water question, which is more or less perplexing throughout the county, it may be said that the vadeys furnish water with little trouble almost everywhere, and that on the bluffs toward the river numerous springs are found, but on the ridges productive wells can be sunk only in exceptional cases and at widely varying depths, and so at almost every house there are cisterns for domestic and stock purposes. Clear Creek starts from a single spring on the farm of John Muder, on section three. It runs northeast, and finady gets an outlet into Minne-"], [394, "380 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. sota Slough, near the mouth of Crooked Creek. This Clear Creek abounds in trout, the speckled beauties that occasion so many weary tramps, so much patient waiting, and affords so much satisfaction when success rewards the toils, the precautions, and hopes of this variety of aquatic sportsmen. with his famdy, which he placed in an improvised residence, 16x20 feet, with a single window and a \"puncheon\" floor. They came with a wagon which was the first in this region, and although it was in the winter, there was but little snow, and the complex team of horses and oxen came through over the trackless distance with little trouble. Crooked Creek has several other affluents, one starting from a spring in section eighteen, on the farm of P. Graham. Its general direction is north east. Another begins at a spring in section twenty -one, and enters the creek near the south hne of the same section. Another little rivulet originates in a spring on the farm of Mr. G. Brown, on section twenty -nine, and reaches the creek on the same section. The general surface of the town inclines toward the river. The bluffs sloping to the south are inclined to be more bare of brush and timber than those in the opposite di rection. At that time the nearest place for supplies was at Lansing, twenty-five miles away. The distance to mill was about forty miles, to Columbus, Iowa, although a nearer route was afterwards looked out and traveled. When the next year the land office was estab hshed in Brownsville, that became quite a good market, and in 1855, Mr. Powlesland sold his corn in the field for fifty cents a bushel. Wm. Oxford was from Boston, and in the fall of 1852, made his way west and put his signet on some land in section thirty, and surrounding a certain amount of space, as a protection against atmospheric vicissitudes, the fodowing spring in- troduced his family to their new abode, which, al- though not up to the Beacon Street standard, nev- ertheless had a capacity for supplying the require- ments of a home. Mr. Oxford also entered a quarter section in thirty-five. The vdlage of Freeburg is located on his old claim, and he also owned pieces of land in other parts of the town. Mr. Oxford came up from Iowa with Mr. Powles- land, and on arriving near the place, the prairie fire having swept over it and obhterated his land marks, Mr. Powlesland became bewildered. At night the oxen were tied, and a retrograde recon- noisance revealed the bearings, so the next morn- ing they came through ad right. Mr. Oxford drove the first team through to Brownsvdle in the spring of 1853, fodowing a narrow Indian trail and returning the same way, doing considerable work on the road, and that to-day is the road to Brownsvide from Crooked Creek. His house, alluded to above, was of logs with an elm bark roof, and the thickness of the floor was only dmited by the diameter of the earth. At first he raised corn, turnips, and buckwheat, and as it was so far to mill, they used a coffee mill to grind the buckwheat, and Mrs. Ox ford's green veil to sift it through, and they thus lived, with, however, plenty of roots and venison, which was obtained of the Indians in exchange for corn and pumpkins. The town was settled mostly by emigrants from Ireland and Germany, who have proved to be in dustrious people. The very first settlers, however, were English, but they soon pushed on to other pastures. As the bluffs are usually covered with some kind of vegetable growth, there is excellent pas turage for sheep which this land is particularly adapted to raising. The Narrow Gauge railroad comes down the Crooked Creek valley to join the trunk line on the river bank, which is now a through line from Minneapolis to St. Louis, and the transfer of freight and passengers is made at the junction. Thus the town, with the Mississippi river, which must always remain a great inter-state thorough fare, and a railroad from the west bi-secting it, and a north and south line on its eastern border, may be said not to be wanting in transportation facilities. The First Settlers \u2014 The first claim planted in this town was that of Mr. George Powlesland, in June, 1852, on section thirty-six. At this time he was working a farm in Iowa, and he soon returned there, but came back in September and cut and cured a lot of hay along the creek bottom and put up a shanty, but again returned to Iowa. At this time Mr. George Littleford, who made a claim further up the creek, came with Mr. Powlesland, but he did not remain untd a year afterwards. On the 12th of January, 1853, Mr. Powlesland arrived"], [395, "CROOKED CREEK TOWNSHIP. 381 The few red men who were about here at the time of the early advent of white men were Win nebagoes, and they must have been straggling bands from the Turkey River reservation, where this tribe, or a part of it, was sent from Wis consin after their treaty with the United States in 1837,in which they ceded all their remaining lands. At this time the Sioux were further north, and only came down this far in detachments on some pre datory expedition. In the fall of 1853, the last contest of any note took place between these here ditary foes near the mouth of Crooked Creek where the railroad junction now is. The Sioux were victorious, as the Winnebagoes came back in a sorry plight, very bloody and crest-fallen. To the colonists, who treated them with consideration, they were always civil. As the country filled up these people were seen less and less frequently, until they finally disappeared altogether, and here \"Where they lived and loved,\" aud hated too for that matter, \"they only survive in the songs and chronicles of their exterminators,\" who should have no dispostion to disparage their rude virtues, or to make light of their unhappy fate, which seems to be in obedience to the law of creation, that the inferior shall give place to the superior. John Muder and sons arrived in 1856, and planted a homestead on section three. Lawrence Duggan settled on section eighteen, where he stid lives. Another old timer is Patrick Graham, who located on section eighteen in the year 1856. Mr. Franz Hurdelbrink reached Crooked Creek in 1857, and has been an enterprizing citizen. He put up the first house with a shingle roof, in the vicinity. EARLY EVENTS. First Birth. \u2014 The initial event of this inter esting character was on the 2 ith of May. 1854, and the little stranger was named Mary Jane Oxford. The First Wedding. \u2014 This happy occurrence was on the 6th of August, 1854, and the high con tracting parties were Mr. Geo. F. Brenner and Miss Caroline B. Weidman. The first remembered death, was that of a child of Mr. and Mrs. David Snyder, in 1858, six years after the first settlement. Anthony Huyck, the enterprising and pioneer, put his sign manual on several eligible acres in Crooked Creek, at an early day, and sold his improvements to actual settlers. Among the hardy pioneers who should be mentioned are Thomas Bayne, and Mr. Dean, who died in the army, Nicholas Roster and family, who secured a claim from Mr. Huyck, with a timber residence 12x14 feet and succeeded in securing 320 acres near or in the present village of Freeburg . George Schaller was one of the arrivals in 1856, and Mr. Snyder came about the same time. An old Indian hunter, who was quite successful, used to stop often at Mr. Oxford's, and he would quietly get up at daybreak and go out and bring in the steak of a deer to cook for breakfast. Mr. Roster passed over to \"the untrodden shore\" in 1872. After a while the people no longer had to go to mill to Yellow River, for a mdl was put up only eighteen miles away, at Waterloo, and d the set tlers were happy then, their cup must have bubbled over, when the mill at Freeburg, right in their own town was built. In 1857, Mr. George Schaller budt a grist-mid. the first in the township. TOWN ORGANIZATION. This important step was taken on the 11th of May, 1858. The first officers chosen were : Super visors, George Powlesland, Chairman; George Muder, and Anthony Noel; A. N. Pierce, Clerk; Wm. Powlesland, Assessor; J. P. Schader, Treas urer; Widiam Oxford, Overseer of the Poor; J. P. Schaller and Lawrence Duggan, Justices of the Peace; John Peryerand Nicholas Krauss, Consta bles. At this meeting, J. P. Schader was Moderator, and L. D. Churchdl was Clerk of the election. The total number of votes cast was 43. The mid was the polling place. In 1858, Mr. Oxford built a saw-mdl and kept it running up to about 1877, when the dam gave out and he gave up the mill. His fine residence was constructed of lumber from this saw. John Palmer is one of the early settlers, coming in 1855. He budt the first house on the ridge where he now lives. George F. Brenner came to the county in 1854, and staked out a claim in section thirty-two. Thomas Eicher migrated here in 1854, and raised a large famdy of children. Thomas Ryder landed in Crooked Creek in August, 1854, but afterwards lived for a time in Wisconsin and Iowa. He has held several town offices in Crooked Creek. SCHOOLS. District No. 46. This was one of the first districts started in the township, and the first"], [396, "382 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. school building was put up in 1856. Mrs. Char lotte Bayne taught the first school in a private house, the first regular term being three months, and thirteen pupils were got together. to Michael Mander, who in turn disposed of it to Nicholas Roster, who kept it going until 1874, when it was again sold, this time to Wm. Hill and J. M. Graf. The mid was burned in December, 1876, and Messrs. Graf & Hurley rebudt on the former site in the summer of 1877, when Mr. Graf purchased the interest of Mr. Garret Hurley, and has since been the sole proprietor. The mill has three run of buhrs, with the requisite auxiliaries, driven by two Eureka turbine wheels. In relation to the same mid it may be proper to add, that it was formerly a saw-mill, with a sash saw, and a capacity of about 2,000 feet a day. It was run for about six years, and demolished in 1866 or '67, and was at first put up to saw lumber for a grist mill. The first grist-mill had a single run of four foot stones, a \"Grimes smutter,\" and a single bolt, with a capacity of about thirty barrels a day, and was driven by a wooden wheel with a center dis charge, which was remakably efficient. Dcstrict No. 92. \u2014 This was taken from No. 46 as late as 1876. The earliest school was taught in Mr. Hurdelbrink's house, and the first teacher was Miss M. J. Finney, of Lansing. The schoolhouse was built in 1877.\" The first trustees were Carl Baeske, Frank Hurdelbrink, and John Brown, and the same gentlemen occupy the same positions now. District No. 45. \u2014 Some time in 1857, this school district was formed and fully organized, and a school was started in a slab shanty of David Sny der by Mrs. Charlotte Bayne. It was a nine months' term, with ten scholars. The first trus tees of this school were Phillip Schaller, George Powlesland, and Wm. Powlesland. The dis trict now has a new schoolhouse. The present trustees are George Brown, Michael Roster, and Thorn* Welsh. RELIGIOUS. Lutheran. \u2014 The first service by this denomina tion was held on September 27th, 1857. The Rev. Mr. Liebrandt was the officiating missionary, and the meetings have been kept up every three or four weeks since. District No. 72. \u2014 This was organized in the spring of 1868. The first trustees were Jacob Walter, Joseph Bigley, and Patrick McCarthy. Miss Ellen Conley taught the first school, in the old house of Mr. L. Yohe. The present trustees are L. Yohe, Thomas Ryder, and George Lam bert. Methodist. \u2014 Services in this interest were held at an early day, the supply being from the larger towns near here. In 1860, the members of this society bought the old schoolhouse of District No. 46, and afterwards used it as a church. The pres ent pastor is Rev. Mr. Bucholt, of Hokah. MANUFACTURES. Broom Factory. \u2014 John Muder commenced to manufacture brooms the first year he came to town, in 1856, on section twenty-seven, where he remained about five years when he removed to section three, and has kept ' up the manufacture ever since. The firm name is now John Muller & Sons. About 4,000 brooms are annually turned out. The work is done during the winter season, and between times, while carrying on the farm. They raise their own broom corn, and supply the whole vicinity with these indispensable household implements. The factory is 16x32 feet, and two stories high, and contains the necessary machin ery. Near this church is a cemetery. The first inter ment was that of a child of Carl Baeske, about 1863. Roman Catholic. \u2014 In 1859, the first mass was said at the house of Mr. Theodore Fisch, by Rev. Father Pendergast. At this service Mr. Oxford's chddren were baptized. Their church was the first in town, and was erected in 1865. It is a frame structure, 30x55 feet. The service is monthly, by Rev. John Zuzek, of Caledonia. There is a cemetery near the church, and the first interment was a child of Mr. John Goergen. FLOURING MILL. NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL CURIOSITIES. The first grst-mill was budt, as already stated, by George Schaller, in the summer of 1857. Mr. Schaller operated the mdl for eight or ten years, and sold to Nicholas Roster and J. P. Streif, and after running it two years or so, it was transferred Fairy Rock. \u2014 This is the name of a bluff in which is a cave. It is in section twenty -three, and about a half a mile north of the railroad junction. This cavern is about twenty-four feet long, ten feet wide, and seven feet high. It has three en-"], [397, "CROOKED CREEK TOWN S II T P. 383 trances, one at each end of the side toward the river, and one on the south. It is situated near the top of the bluff, two hundred feet or so above the water. Its walls and ceiling are of sandstone and they are covered with the names of visitors who have inscribed here with the dates, for the last twenty years or more, and some go back to 1856. One of the early settlers, Mr. Charles Brown, of Brownsville, utilized this place as a residence dur ing a part of his early experience here. For those who have never visited any of the noted caves this would be well worth looking at, although if the name has given an etherial idaa of the cavern and its surroundings, it might be disappointing in that regard, for the make up of the hill and dell sug gests anything but fairy like views. along the river and the Narrow Guage road from the west, and where everything has to be trans ferred. It contains the station, a residence for the agent, roundhouse, coal shed, water-tank for both roads, stock and transfer yards and other facilities. It has the Junction House, the Cliff House, and several other dwellings and a Post-office. The government name of the post-office is Reno: John Merkle is the Postmaster. It is not likely that this village will increase in size for a long time, as there is hardly room for expansion without as cending the bluff or running back into the valley, and the location on the slough, with the extensive aduvium deposits in such close proximity, is not conducive to the higest condition of health. What improvements may be made in this regard by controlling the great river, or dfting its present marshy banks by some ambitious journeyman world repairer, no one can now predict. Pre-Historio Mound. \u2014 On section three is a mound about twenty feet high and one hundred and fifty feet long. At first it had quite a sharp outline and was symetrical, but since it began to be cultivated, a few years ago, its form is disap pearing. BIOGRAPHICAL. The pioneers George Powlesland, John Merkle, and John N. Roster, are so frequently referred to and thed sketches so interwoven with the town ship history, that nothing of importance remains to be said under this heading. Robbers' Roost. \u2014 On the Mississippi lowlands, in section thirty-six, nearly opposite the Bad Axe, is a place where, during the war, ten or twelve men lived by plundering on the river and along the banks on both sides. The roost was finally raided and some of the men shot, and some drowned, and others were sent to the Wisconsin State prison. Thomas Bayne is a native of England, born in the city of Westminster in 1814. His father was killed in the Napoleon wars, and when Thomas was thirteen months old he was sent to the Royal Mditary Asylum on the Isle of Wight, remaining until the age of five years, when he was transferred to a similar institution at Chelsea. At the age of thirteen years he was sent to the Royal Mditary Codege at Sandhurst, where he enlisted as mu sician and served thirteen years, The college then being reduced he was discharged, but soon after enlisted in the Navy,on board the \"Blenheim,\" which was the first vessel that went to China at the time of the opium disturbance. In 1835, Mr. Bayne was united in marriage with Miss Charlotte Sewry, the result of which union was three chd dren, only one of whom is now hving. Mrs. Bayne was born in Sandhurst, England, on the 10th of October, 1819. After coming to this piece she taught school for a time, being the first teacher iu tha town. They came to America in 1850, re sided in Galena, Hlinois, about three years, then came to Houston county and settled in Browns vide, coming to Crooked Creek about 1853. Since his residence here he has held several local offices and was one of the signers to the petition for a Present officers of the town of Crooked Creek : Supervisors, George Powlesland, Chairman ; Philip Ott, Fred Roth; Treasurer, Lawrence Yohe; Clerk, John N.

Mr. Muder and sons occupy one of the finest dwellings in Houston county. It is a two story brick structure, with cedar under the entire building, also have a fine stable, tool house, spring-house, granary, broom factory, etc. The farm contains nine hundred and twenty acres, which was once a wilderness, but by industry and perseverance is now a fine, productive farm and an elegant home. J. M. Graf was born in Baden, Germany, on the 11th of November, 1845. At the age of two years he came to America, locating in New Albany, Indiana, from which place he moved to Dubuque, Iowa, thence to Minnesota in 1859, se lecting a farm near Brownsvide. When fifteen years of age he run a threshing machine, which occupation he continued for sixteen successive fads. In 1872, he was joined in marriage with Miss Caroline Foshard. They have had five chddren, four of whom are living. After a resi dence of two years in this town, they returned to Brownsville in 1874, then traveled through Mis souri in search of farming land, but returned again to Brownsville and thence to Freeburg, where Mr. Graf purchased a half interest in a grist-mid. On the 27th of December, 1876, the mill burned, and the following summer our sub ject, in company with Garret Hurley, rebudt it, running the same until September, 1880, when Mr. Hurley sold his interest to Mr. Graf, who has since operated the mill. Since coming to Free burg, by industry and perseverance Mr. Graf has acquired a thorough knowledge of the milling business, giving satisfaction to customers and making it lucrative for himself. August Neumann was born in Pomerania, Prussia, on the 6th of April, 1852. He received his education and learned the shoemaker trade at Stargard, coming to America in 1870. He came to Houston county the same year, locating in Brownsville. In 1873, he removed to Crooked Creek which has since been his home. On the 27th of May, 1879, Miss Louisa Mann became his wife. She was bom in this county on the 26th of Sep tember, 1859. One child was born of this union, on the 3d of January, 1880, a daughter, named Bertha. William Oxford, one of the oldest living set tlers in the town, is a native of South Hampton, England, born on the 1st of April, 1825. On the 9th of April, 1849, he was joined in matrimony with Miss Mary Wakefield of his native city. They came to America the same year, remaining in Boston, Massachusetts, for a time, where Mr. Ox ford was engaged as coachman. In 1851, they came to Allamakee county, Iowa, and the follow ing year to Crooked Creek. Mr. Oxford, in com pany with Mr. Powlesland started from Iowa with an ox and a horse team, lost their way and were obliged to return, but making a second attempt they finally reached the cabin of Mr. Powlesland which he had previously erected. Mr. Oxford drove the first team to Brownsville, coming on the Indian trail, in the spring of 1853. Immediately after arriving in Crooked Creek he erected a log house in which he and his family resided for some time. The first year they raised buckwheat, tur nips, corn, etc., and as the grist-mill was about sixty miles away they ground their buckwheat in a coffee-mid, sifted it through Mrs. Oxford's ved, and lived on the flour for a time. In 1858, Mr. Franz Hurdelbrink is a native of Germany, born in Osnabruck, Hanover, on the 17th of June, 1824. His father was a blacksmith, which trade Franz learned when young. In 1850 he came to America, landing in New Orleans in December, thence to St. Louis, and finally came to Houston county, locating in Crooked Creek in 1857. On the 26th of October, 1858, Miss Henrietta Riebe, of Crawford county, Wisconsin, became his wife.

Mr. Hur delbrink, though a good mechanic, has devoted his time to the cultivation of his farm since coming here. John Muller, one of the oldest settlers of this town, having come in 1856, is a native of Baden, Germany, born in the year 1816.

Phillip Palmer, who was bom on the 28th of November, 1817, is a native of Homersfield, Suf folk county, England, which was his home until the age of twenty-five years. On the 25th of Oc tober, 1842, he was joined in marriage with Miss Phillis Huarry, of Albridge, Norfolk county. They moved to Woolwich, remaining eleven years, after which they came to America. On the 29th of January, 1855, Mrs. Palmer died, near St. Louis, Missouri, leaving five chddren; Elizabeth, now residing in Washington Territory; George, in Brownsville; Harriet, in Missouri; Alice, in Man kato; Elijah and George are in Brownsville run ning a saw-mill. Mr. Palmer came to this county in 1860, settled in Brownsville, and five years later purchased his present farm, on which he moved and has since lived. John Palmer was born on the 23d of May, 1812, at Albridge, Norfolk county, England. He was reared in Homersfield, Suffolk county, and on the 14th of May, 1833, was married in the latter place to Miss Maria Sampson. They moved to Woolwich, remained seven years, and came to America, landing in New Orleans in 1853. After a short residence in the latter place they moved to Missouri, and in 1856, to this place, taking a claim in July of the same year, on which they have since lived.

DESCRIPTIVE EARLY SETTLEMENT TOWN ORGAN- This river, which was readdy navigable before the mills were erected, runs the whole length of the town, dividing into two branches just outside its western line, and uniting in section twenty eight, joins the Mississippi about two miles from the north line of the town. IZATION HOKAH VILLAGE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS DIRECTORY FRATERNAL ORDERS RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS BIOGRAPHICAL. This is the name of a town on the Mississppi River, and the second from the northern boundary of the county, having La Crescent on the north and Brownsvide on the south, with Union and Mound Prairie on the west. Its topography is not materially unlike the other river towns; valleys, bluffs, and ridges prevail with great impartiality. The valley of Root River may be said to be on an average of two miles wide. The river is joined by other streams, the most important of which is Thompson's Creek, which, on account of its being fed by springs, furnishes a remarkably reliable water power which can be utilized by a fall of about thirty -six feet; although now but about twenty-six feet, it serves every purpose. The name of the town, and the vdlage which is located at the first eligible point up the stream, was the Indian name of Root River, and is said to have been also the name of a powerful Indian Chief whose village, before the disturbing elements To describe the physical features of the town in 25"], [400, "386 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. detad would be to cover ground already gone over in describing other townships. spring of 1854. His log cabin had a sad for a roof, which he brought from the East. Wildam James settled on section thirty -four, on what is now John Huffman's estate, as early as 1852, and two years later removed to section five, where, a few years afterwards he died. EARLY SETTLEMENT. Edward Thompson is the pioneer colonist of Hokah. Coming here in the spring of 1851, he saw the value of the water power, which a com paratively small outlay would enable him to util ize. His resolution to secure it was prompt, and his action energetic. He made an impromptu pre emption without formadty, except, perhaps, to drive some corner stakes, as a warning to other land-lookers not to interfere with his unwritten, but inahenable rights. How he built his mill and raised his dam will be recorded in another place. An enterprising logger, named Wid Richmond put up a shanty on section thirty-four, on the Root River, about 1849. With him was John Kreels. They cuded out the best timber and rafted it down to the Mississippi, but made no improvement except to make themselves comfor table whde there. Richmond afterwards lived in Brownsville, where he kept a hotel. When first occupied,the bottom land was heavdy timbered with the finest specimens of black wal nut, oak, maple, and other hard wood, which were cut in large quantities and rafted down the river, and later, were sawed up by local machinery. In October, 1851, Mr. Thompson brought his wife and family to this western wild, and she was the first and only white woman here for some time. Several persons came with Mr. Thompson, to assist in building the mill, among them John H. Steward, a blacksmith. C. W. Thompson, a brother of Edward, soon came and took a very prominent part in developing the interests of the settlement. Albert Blackinton and wife were also along about that time. Hiram Griffin was another. David House was an early comer, and located in what is now Union. Fred Hammer, Widiam Rielur, and Jerry Jenks, were also among the first arrivals. TOWN ORGANIZATION. The first town meeting was held on the 11th of May, 1858, the day on which many of the older towns in the county organized. The meeting, which was at the Hokah House in the village, was called to order by Clark W. Thompson. J. G. Prentiss was called to the chair, and Mr. L. S. Keeler was chosen moderator in due form, with D. L. Clements as clerk. The result of the election was as follows : The whole number of ballots cast was seventy-two; Supervisors elected were C. W. Thompson, Chairman; R. S. Woolley, and David House; Clerk, D. L. Clements; Assessor, S. E. Sneider; Overseer of the Poor, A. H. Davison; Constables, Anthony Demo, Jr. and Henry Frank lin; Collector, Anthony, Demo, Jr. Justices of the Peace, L. L. West and Lewis Pond. Poor Jenks was taken sick, and Thompson started a man for La Crosse, to procure a doctor, he was directed to go to a certain point on the river, where a man lived of whom he could get a canoe to set himself across. On arriving there he found the house deserted, and a dead Indian in the yard, so he came back terror stricken without a doctor. A messenger was then sent to the Little Iowa River settlement, and at the end of thirty -six hours he returned with a doctor, who proved to be a \"hydropath,\" which was fashionable treat ment at that time, and he put the man in cold water pack, which promptly broke the fever, but the man died. It was voted that \"all hogs found running at large after the 20th of May shall be liable to a fine of one dollar each.\" It was resolved \"that a fence four and a half feet high, and with not less than four rails, not over eighteen inches from the ground, shall be a legal fence.\" Butterfield valley, which comes up to the village from the south, was first settled about 1853, on sec tion eight, on the present farm of G. A. Graf, by Hiram Butterfield, who came here from Illinois and remained until about 1874, when he went to Oregon where he has since died. On the 29th of May, at a meeting of the board, the following gentlemen were appointed overseers of the several road districts from one to six re spectively : J. G. Prentiss, H. W. Hunsell, Lorenzo Hafner, Edwin Butterfield, R. D. Davis, and Frederick Hammer. It is supposed that the first settler on the \"Ridge\" was John Densch, who arrived in the At a meeting on the 5th of Aprd, 1864, it was voted, twenty -nine to twenty-three, that the town"], [401, "HOKAH TOWNSHIP. 387 should pay a bounty of $100 to each of those who might enlist in the army before the first of Sep tember. Affairs have been carefudy managed up to the present time. The officers elected in the spring of 1881, were: Trustees, W..F. Weber, Chris. Brown, and Henry Brown; Recorder, J. C. Snure; Treasurer, J. G. Groat; Assessor, J. Gregory; Justice of the Peace, Mark Hargreaves; and Constable, J. J. Hohl. The leading citizens and business men have always filled the village offices. TOWN OFFICERS FOR 1881. Supervisors, George A. Graf, Chairman, Chris. Hammer, and John Tshumper; Treasurer, Jacob Becker; Assessor, Jacob Dabold; Timothy Redly, Clerk. No other officers were elected. HOKAH VILLAGE. Hokah, as a village has had more than an or dinary share of vicissitudes; at times its business has been inadequate for the demands upon it, and again, some fortuitous circumstances, against which ordinary prudence seemed incapable of pro viding, the supply would exceed the demand, and that hope, which is supposed to \"spring eternal in the human breast,\" would leave its citizens on the verge of despair. This is the head and the heart of the town, and its history, of course, will make up the foreground of this sketch, while the town, as it exists as the surrounding country, will make up the back ground, and of necessity, the lines of demarkation may be so obscure that it will be difficult to see where the one leaves off and the other begins. The village is most charmingly situated on a ridge, in a crescentic form, reached by a not very abrupt incline from the northeast. The principal business street is along this ridge, with a slope to the north and on to the Root River valley, and to the south into Lake Como, which, although it may not be \"margined by fruits of gold and whisper ing myrtles,\" nevertheless, reflects \"skies as cloud less save with rare and roseate shadows\" as its patronymic counterpart in the old world. The taking away of the railway shops was a serious blow to its prosperity, from which it has been slow to recover, but neither its location, its scenery, nor its magnificent water power, can be taken from it, and it requires but little of the spirit of prophecy to foretell that its future must be of a steady, growing character, without remittent or intermittent periods of depression, beyond those common to the whole country. While there is plenty of fuel in a community , the value of water power is not fully realized, and when the land shall have been completely denuded of the primeval timber, the water power will be appreciated, and Hokah will assume its true position, and confirm the genius of Thompson in securing this site, Whde the village overlooks the scenery all around, there is, in not a remote distance, a series of peaks on peaks on every side, arising with almost Alpine sharpness of outline, and only want ing in altitude the character of mountain scenery; and to one who has never been beyond the con fines of a prairie country, a sudden transition to this spot would be a realizing of the poet's and the artist's picture. The original plat of Hokah village included Main Street with lots on either side, with an ex pansion near the west end and three or four blocks south, besides a dozen or so on the north of Main Street. VILLAGE ORGANIZATION. Hokah was constituted an independent village by an act of the legislature of the State, approv ed on the 2d of March, 1871. There have been several additions platted since that time. Thompson, Jones & Padedord's, on tht northwest; Babcock & Thompson's, on the east of the village, across the foot of the lake; Thompson & Wilkinson's, on the northeast; James' addition across Lake Como, on the south; J. M. Thompson's, near the railroad station ; Weber's addition and sub-addition, on the west, with sev eral others in the lower part of the town. A pub lic square was reserved in the original plat, and a cemetery is on the western border. The first election was in May following. S..J. Prentiss and E. H. Keeler were the election judges. The first officers chosen were: Trustees, H. H. Bowdisb, John F. Russell, and Widiam Wightman. Mr. Bowdisb was president of the board. Justice of the Peace, David House; Treas urer, W. F. Weber; Constables, Oliver P. Sprague and H. L. Dunham. A corporate seal was procured, and the vdlage set up for itself as an independent municipality. From a peak which rises near here, on the west ern border of the town, a beautiful view of La"], [402, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 388 floor, and Lynch's Hotel had a like amount. Bridges were swept away and much'damage done. Crosse can be had through the gap to the north east. Lake Como is of an irregular outline, not many rods wide, but about one mile in length, hugging the southern edge of the original village, and is a lovely sheet of water. In the fall of 1860, there was considerable talk about bridging the Mississippi at La Crosse. On the 17th of February, 1860, the store of Clements & Ames, together with the Masonic Had, were totally destroyed by fire. Some of the goods were saved, but in the hall everything went. VARIOUS EVENTS OF LOCAL INTEREST. The first saw-mill put up by Thompson was a portable affair, called an endless chain mill, and, although it was a creditable concern, but of course in comparison with the \"gangs\" and \"rotaries\" now used, was moderation itself, and so the stories as to its performance had to be told. One old settler says that the sawyer used to start the saw on a twelve foot log, and then go to breakfast, and when he returned the saw would be nearly through the cut, and ready to be \"gigged\" back for the next board. On Tuesday, the 10th of July, 1860, Jacob Rei der made a deadly assault upon his wife's lather's family, terribly cutting up and killing Mrs. Anna S. Hanks and her daughter Pauline. He was ap prehended. In August of the same year, a little child of Mr. and Mrs. Sara was lost, and not found untd ten days afterwards, when it had been dead some days. The ferry across the Mississippi was always a great source of trouble, the views of the proprie tors and the patrons did not coincide as to fares, maximum prices were demanded on the one side and minimum on the other. In the spring of 1861, the ferry war was particularly fierce. The McRoberts was one of the boats then. Edward Thompson was the first Justice of the Peace, and if a wedding was on the tapis, it would be sure to attract an improvised calithumpian crowd, and the Justice used to exercise considera ble genius, to circumvent the motley assembly, to save the newly wedded pair from the annoyance. At one time a German woman, whose sons had put the notion in her head, to secure some pecuniary advantage, applied for a divorce, and Thompson, in the interest of peace and domestic morality, summoned the parties before him, and securing an interpreter, proceeded to investigate the case, and learning wherein each party had been to blame, decided that the grounds for separation were not sufficient, that they must return and live together, and neither was in future to give any cause for offense, under pain of severe penalties. So they returned and never had any more trouble. In 1862, a bridge across the Root River at Hokah was built, to take the place of a ferry boat. In December, 1861, Herbert A. Twitched was drowned by breaking through the ice. On the 1st and 2d of September, 1862, was the time of the Indian scare, few, if any, left here on that occasion, but the town was full of fugitives. In September, 1862, a new ferry boat was put on at La Crosse, to the infinite satisfaction of ad parties. TOWN HALL. This is a fine public building, of brick, used for town and village business. The hall is large and well adapted to public meetings. In the basement are offices for police court business, committees, and other purposes, and also the lock-up. It was built in 1878, at a cost of $3,600. Its location is on the south side of Main Street, near the busi ness center of the town. In July, 1859, abashing house was erected near the stone dam; free for ladies in the forenoon and gentlemen in the afternoon. Among the best remembered steamers to run up the Root River about the years 1857 and '58, were the \"Transit,\" which plied between La Crosse and Hokah; it was 100 feet long and twenty-five feet beam, and the \"Little Frank,\" which run up as far as Rushford and finally sunk below the ferry at Houston. BANK. In 1859, a bank was located in Hokah, it was called the La Crosse and La Crescent Bank, and stood wed while it remained in existence. Before Thompson's grist -mid was put up, the people had to go fifty mdes to mill. HOKAH WATER POWER. The Root River was very high in 1854, and again in July, 1859. At this time a portion of the machine shop had two feet of water on the The Hokah water-power is the greatest on the river, and, except Lanesboro, the most expensive. Work was commenced on it in 1866. The railroad"], [403, "HOKAH TOWNSHIP. 389 company made a division of Root River at this place, to save the construction of two bridges, and Mr. Thompson placed his head gates in the old channel at the upper crossing, using the old bed between the two railroad crossings. From thence he excavated a canal six feet deep, fifty feet wide, and 1,500 to 1,800 feet long, through the bottoms to the mouth of Thompson's Creek, which is used as a tad race to the mills. In the construction of the dam there was used 1,500 cords of timber, and 500 cords of stone for the foundation , after giving sufficient time for settling. Mr. Thompson put the dam on the top, consisting of crib work planked with three inch pine plank. In order to do this he built coffer dams around the north had of the dam, thus enabling him to work without being troubled with the current forcing the surplus water over the other half, and when that was finished, doing the other half in the same manner, using 100 cords of stone and three car loads of plank. The completion of the dam was hailed with de light by a large portion of tbe neighbors as it afforded a good crossing of Root River. After making the dam tight he covered the whole with stone, making a crossing from twenty to fifty feet wide. about $150 per month. The Telegraph and Ameri can Express offices are 'also at the station. POST-OFFICE. The Post-office isdn the hardware store of , Weber & Snure. The sale of (stamps and stamped en velopes, with postal cards, amounts to about $200 each quarter. The Post-ofice was estabhshed two years or so after the first settlement, and Edwards Thompson was appointed Postmaster, J. Gregory was the deputy. R. S. Woolley was the next Postmaster, and finally W. F. Weber was appointed, who still re tains the place. It wdl thus be seen that there have been but three different Postmasters in Hokah. EARLY MILLS AND JmANUFACTURING. Mr. Thompson and others were attracted to this locahty on account, primarily, of the superb water power, and also, on account of the\" heavy timber, the productive character'ofrthejSoil, and'its being on a navigable stream, so convenient to the Mis sissippi. Such a place would naturally invite attention, and it is proposed to briefly sketch the most im portant of the various mechanical enterprises that were instituted here at various times. During the past season the mills have had plen ty of water through the lowest stage of water ever known in Root River, and there has been enough running over the dam to drive at at least 200 horse power, thus affording a good chance for some enterprising man to come here and start some good business. It will not be leased for milling as there are already mills enough here. Agricultural works, paper-mill, woolen or cotton factory, or any other good business would be appreciated and assisted by the citizens. As already intimated,'Mr. E. Thompson was the first to put up a saw-mill, in 1852. The dam, as first constructed, secured 3the \"enormous fad of thirty sixTfeet,'the pressure of which was^too great for it to stand the urgent appeal to \"move on,\" and just as the mill was ready to start, the dam being a \"little lame\" concluded to start first, and so it stole away. But such a dttle thing as that was not to suppress\"; the dauntless energy of Thompson, although it was a hard blow. He modifiedjhis plans and reconstructed^the dam with a head of twenty-fhtefeet, and in due time had his mid in motion. RAILROADS. The Soutberm Minnesota division of the Chi cago, Milwaukee and St. Paid railroad runs west through this town, giving direct communication with La Crosse on the east and Dakota on the west. The Chicago, Cdnton and Dubuque divi sion of the same road runs north and south, one or two mdes from the river, so that the radroad communication leaves nothing to be desired in this regard. Mr. F. F. Powers is station agent at Hokah, and J. E. Turner, night operator. From Mr. Powers the fodowing statistics are gathered: Freight received annuady, about 4, 000, 000 pounds ; freight forwarded 3,750,000 pounds; passenger fare, In 1853, his brother, C. W. Thompson, came into the concern and put up a grist mdl. These mills were near the site of the present stone mill. The saw-mill had a Muley saw, and could cut 5,000 feet of hardwood:lumber\"in a day. At first it was a portable mdl, but soon two run of stones were put in, and it is not unlikely that this was the first mill west of the Mississippian^Minnesota. C. W. Thompson afterwards started a furniture factory, which for a tinie'did a good^business. A. M. Thompson and S. J. Prentiss started a"], [404, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 390 plow factory; the plow manufactured was of steel, and a very good implement, but it was finally sold, and one of the flouring mdls afterwards re sulted. and west, north and south. Hokah can certainly never be subjected to influences that will destroy the advantages it now possesses, and its future will of necessity be in contrast with the depressing circumstances of the last few years. The manufacture of brick has been carried on in the western part of the town by W. F. Weber, and some were also burned near the railroad shops. FLOURING MILLS. Crescent Roller Mill. \u2014 This mill was erected in 1872, by C. A. & E. V. White. The latter soon retired and S. C. White assumed his place. It was built in a substantial way 38x46 feet, and three stories with a basement, it contained six run of stones and one purifier. The power was that of the Root River, with an avadable fall of six feet, and five or six turbine wheels were used to run the mill, which had a capacity of 175 barrels a day. In 1874, it became necessary to attach an elevator 30x38 feet. In 1869, Wm. M. Wykoff started a foundry, which did mostly railroad work. HARD TIMES. Previous to the panic of 1857, which was pre cipitated upon the country by the fadure of the Ohio Loan and Trust Company, of New York, Hokah was flourishing and building up with great rapidity. But the crisis came, and like a sirocco, every thing withered before it; hope was supplanted by dispair, prosperity was transformed into impecu niosity, and all the balloons, which had been so industriously blown up, were codapsed. The little frontier town of Hokah felt the recoil, and did not recover until even after the war. Various improvements were made up to 1880, when it was remodeled and transformed into a roller mill. It now has twelve sets of rods and two run of stones, nine purifiers and all the modern re quirements for a first-class mill, with a daily capacity of from 200 to 250 barrels. In 1881, the property was purchased by W. W. Cargdl & Bro., who stdl own and operate the es tablishment. BETTER TIMES. In 1866, the Southern Minnesota railroad be gan operations. The next year the splendid rad road shops were budt, Mr. Edward Thompson being the master mechanic, and the hopes which, having been so long deferred,had saddened so many hearts, again returned, the vidage began to revive, business reappeared on the streets, new mills were put up and old ones remodeled, and everything seemed to conduce to the permanent growth and prosperity of the place, and thus it went on until June, 1880, when the Chicago, Mdwau kee & St. Paul Company got possession of the railroad, the car shops were broken up, and the workmen scattered. While this was a serious blow to the vidage, and required a readjustment of affairs by reducing the business, it was very far from destroying it. We look around and what do we see? Two of the best water powers in Southern Minnesota, a group of permanent stone shops, with the water power intact ready for any manufacturing business, we see four first class flouring mills, with their elevators and cooper shops, giving employment to scores of men; we see the business houses still here, and finally, we see the munificent location, with its charming scenery, and the means of transportation east Grampian Mill. \u2014 This flouring mdl with the Scotch name is the result of a transformation act on the part of Edward Thompson, in the year 1874. At first it was a three run mdl; it had a peculiar, irregular form, and did merchant work exclusively. There was a single turbine wheel under a seven foot head. After awhile an eleva tor was erected adjoining the mid, with a capac ity of 20,000 bushels, and at various times con siderable sums were spent in improvements. In 1878, it was sold to S. C. White & Co., and in 1879, it passed into the possession of Brooks, Nash & Co., who managed it for one year. In 1880. the mdl was leased to the firm of Hyde & Brooks, who improved the machinery and its capacity. It now has ten sets of rolls, five purifiers, and other aux iliaries requisite to a first-class merchant mill, with a capacity of 160 to 175 barrels a day. The elevator has been enlarged to a capacity of 30,000 bushels. The elevator part of the business was at one time operated by outside parties, but since 1880, it has been leased to Hodges & Hyde. The mid is stdl run by water."], [405, "HOKAH TOWNSHIP. 391 Pembtna Flouring Mill. \u2014 This building was put up and at first used as a plow factory, where diamond, or silver steel plows were manufactured. In the year 1877, it was metamorphosed into a flouring mill by White & Edwards. The follow ing year the property was bought by S. C. White & Co., who kept its stones and rolls revolving until 1881, when it was secured by S. P. & E. V. White, the former having it in charge. At first it had three ran of stones and five sets of rolls, propeded by two wheels under a head of six or eight feet, and could run through 100 barrels a day. Late in 1881, it had a reformation, and became exclu sively a Hungarian process mid, with six sets of rolls, six purifiers, ten silk and five wire reels, two bran dusters, and other adjuncts for the produc tion of 135 barrels, a large per cent, of which is high grade flour. BREWERY. The Root River Brewery is located on section twenty-eight. It was erected in 1867, by Joseph Pfeffer, Jr., at a cost of about $10,000, and it has a capacity of thirty gallons a day, of the amber colored liquid. It early began to do a very good business. In a few months it fell into the hands of Burkhart & Laugen, and seven years later it was purchased by J. G. Striegal, who has since managed it. The property, just now, is the sub ject of htigation. BEE CULTURE. This industry has received considerable care in and about Hokah. Widiam Lossing is the \"King Bee\" man in this section. He commenced a few years ago, and last year secured about 4,000 pounds of honey, and with a good season wid raise from 10,000 to 15,000 pounds next year. His bees are now almost exclusively Italian. He has the latest improved hives, managing and handling his colonies in the modern and scientific way, thus obtaining the best results by utilizing the labor of the working bees. The old methods of natural swarming, and of destroying the bees to take up the honey, and leaving them out through the winter, is entirely abandoned. A knowledge of the habits, instincts, and require ments of these industrious and intedigent dttle insects, has revolutionized thed treatment, and now they are comfortably housed in winter, pro tected from their enemies, and for this they return a rich reward. Joseph Jaques, J. Baden, Andrew Quist and others also keep bees. It is a most fas cinating industry. These descriptions include the three merchant flouring mdls of Hokah, which have a capacity of absorbing not only all the grain raised in the vicinity, but large amounts coming from the west by rail. City Flouring mill. \u2014 This mill uses the pow er first brought into requisition by Mr. Thompson, and is near where he placed the original mid. The spot has seen many changes. At one time there was a furniture factory here, erected to utilize the bard woods abounding near. The present structure is of stone, 50x60 feet, and was put up by Carl Fisher, about 1873. It is two stories high, and at first had two ran of stones which were taken from Thompson's old mill, but it has since been improved and its capacity in creased. It does custom work almost exclusively, and is operated by an overshot wheel with 21 feet fall. Mr. L. Fisher, a son of the former owner, now owns and operates the null. BUSINESS DIRECTORY. C. E.

Contiguous to each of the three principal mills, is a cooper shop, in which Doud, Son & Co., of Winona, make barrels. The eardest shop put up was in 1872, for the Crescent mid, and this shop now turns out about 125 barrels a day. All the shops together put up from 400 to 500 a day, and employ about 30 hands.

The first doctor here was Charles Jenks, who began in 1856, while yet a student, and practised between his medical courses in codege. There have been other fraternal societies, par ticularly in the interest of the temperance cause, when the town was on the flood-tide of prosperity, but they have gone into a decline, and can now only be remembered for the presumptive good they have done. FRATERNAL ORDERS. Hokah Lodge, No, 17, A. F. & A. M. \u2014 Institu ted on the 17th of January, 1857, in accordance with instructions given by the Grand Lodge on the 8th of January the same year. The number of this lodge should have been nine, as that would be its consecutive number according to priority of institution, but the delegate did not reach St. Paul until the last day of the session of the Grand Lodge. hokah brass band. In the fall of 1879, John McCormick started a subscription to secure means to help procure a set of instruments for a band. The assistance thus rendered enabled the members, after a few dives into their own pockets, to purchase a good set. The first members of the band were : J. J. Hohl, Wm. Blake, Jacob Dibble, Harry Mellon, Hdam Calhhan, Wm. Lossing, L. M. Addleman, John Lyon, J. W. Ball, Oscar Medon. The charter members of the lodge were: C. W. Thompson, Samuel McPhail, Ole Knudson, Oreb Parker, Wm. F. Dunbar, Edward Thompson, Wm. F. Ross, and Wm. B. Burfield. On the 17th of February, 1860, the Masonic Had was burned, with the charter, records, jewels, and fixtures. After this it met for a time at Mr. E. Thompson's and other private houses, until a had was improvised in the Hokah House. The lodge now has a good had over the Post-office, erected in 1870. F. E. Wood was employed as instructor, and the band was soon able to render martial and other music for festive occasions. The personnel of the Band at present is as fol lows : Widiam Lossing, J. J. Hohl, Martin Deim, Hiram Callihan, Charles Thompson, J. W. Bad, A. Smarc, E. Bon worth, John Lyon, Fred Yeskee, and W. H. Blake. The past masters of the lodge are : Wm. Hun ter, C. W. Thompson, Edward Thompson, B. F. Pidge, D. L. Clements, S. J. Prentiss, L. T. Lyon, These young men are entitled to great credit"], [407, "HOKAH TOWNSHIP. 393 for their devotion to music in this amateur way, which has placed the Band not far behind pro fessionals. the schoolhouse; of late, however, they have met in the Presbyterian Church. The first minister to preach here was the Rev. Benjamin Crist, as early as 1854. He wasfodowed by John Hooper, and Rev. Elijah Tate was also sent here, but after his first sermon, was taken sick and did not return. Rev. Edenwood was also here. Rev. William McKinley, now a lead ing member of the conference, at one time had this charge. J. C. Braden, who has since left the ministry, preached here. C. J. Hays remained two years. J. G. Tetter was another, who is still in the conference. Then came James Door, who remained three years, and after he left, A. Stephen son, James Hilton, and J. W. Stebbins were sta tioned here. The latter remained two years and was then at La Crescent two years, still supplying the place. Rev. J. H. Golbome, was in Hokah one year, followed by E. S. Bunce and J. Had, the latter being the last regular pastor. RELIGIOUS. Presbyterian. \u2014 In 1858, the Rev. D. C. Lyon, Synodical missionary for Wisconsin, visited Ho kah, and was requested by Benjamin F. Pidge to procure and send them a minister. In July, 1859, Mr. Lyon met the Rev. Sheldon Jackson, of the Presbytery of Albany, who was looking for a field of labor. He was informed of the circum stances, and came at once. Mr. J. G. Prentiss started a subscription paper to secure a support for the new minister, and Hokah and La Crescent were joined together for this purpose. On Tuesday, the 20th of September, 1859, an organization was effected. The Rev. Mr. Lyon and Judge Day were the active committee, and it was joined to the Presbytery of Winnebago. The list of members is here presented: Benjamin F. Pidge and Agnes his wife, J. G. Prentiss and Pau line N. his wife, Mrs. Mary Y. Jackson, and W. F. Weber. Messrs. Pidge, Prentiss, and Weber were chosen as elders. This society never had a church bidding, but met in private houses, in the schoolhouse, the Ma sonic Hall, and other places. Deaths and re movals have depleted the number untd there are now but three active members remaining, and this remnant of the flock has united with the Gre man Methodist Church. In 1860, many of the original congregation hav ing moved away, the weekly meetings were changed to once in two weeks. German Methodist Episcopal Church. \u2014 The Hokah Circuit was organized on the 2d of May, 1858, by Rev. Charles Leibrandt, with eighteen members; their names being: John Lottes, G. Koehle, J. Koehle, Eliza Knecht, Dina Koethe, Emilie Brenner, Barbara Heidel, Andrew Hartmann, M. Bertch, Anna Lottes, O. Koethe, Catherine Koehle, Christine Hammer, and J. Diedemeyer. At first meetings were held in the old schoolhouse, but the church was budt in 1859. The fodowing named ministers have had successive charge: Charles Leibrandt, Henry Kolbe, Aug. Lambrecht, John G. Spechmann, John Brauer, E. E. Schuette, John Hansen, H. Eber hardt, Charles Schoenheider, F. Hogrefe, W. H. Meyer, and the present pastor, Rev. F. W. Buck holz. There are at present seventy-five members and twenty probationers. In 1859, a delegate was sent to Eau Claire, Wis consin, to attend the Chippewa Presbytery. A church was begun in 1866, under the minis try of Rev. James Marr, and it was completed and dedicated on the 19th of May, 1867, the Rev. James Frothingham preaching the sermon. Some time after this, on account of many of the members removing from the town, the church was virtually transferred to La Crescent, but subsequently, under the the ministration of Rev. J. H. Carpenter, was reorganized at Hokah with seven members. Services were afterwards held by Mr. Carpenter and Rev. J. J. Smith and Rev. Leonard Radcliffe, who laid the foundation for a parsonage in 1874 or '75. Mr. Carpenter returned in 1877, and remained until 1881. There is at present no settled pastor. The records show that thirty-one members have been received since its first organization. The appointments of this circuit are Hokah, Pine Creek, Caledonia Ridge, and Crooked Creek. There is a church budding and a parsonage at each of these places. In Hokah the Presbyterian Church is used for worship. Methodist Episcopal Church. \u2014 This is in the Winona District, and in the Hokah and Browns vide circuit. At Brownsvide the church was budt in 1866.

Pfeffer, near the town line, on section twenty nine. It is a small budd ing, that will seat perhaps fifty persons. It was at the time a mere outlying mission from La Crosse. Since the establishment of the convent, no mass has been said in this little chapel. The first priest to visit here was Rev. Henry Tappers, and then Father Essing. Clark officiated, and then came Elder D. M. Smith. Elder J. H. Bowker preached here some five months after this, but since that time there has not been stated preaching, the members attending the services of the other denominations. German Lutheran Evangelical. \u2014 This de nomination assumed form in 1874, under the fos tering care of Rev. Mr. Warner, and afterwards, Rev. Mr. Jabn. The church was built in the year above mentioned, and is a part of a regular cir cuit embracing Hokah, Portland Prairie, Caledonia Ridge, Brownsvdle and other places. The Convent. \u2014 The name of this institution is the Academy of the Sisters of Notre Dame. Its erection was commenced in 1866, and so far com pleted in September, 1867, that the sisters came and occupied it. There were at first three of them, with one candidate. Now there are eleven sis ters and three candidates. There are accommoda tions for boarders as well as day scholars, and at times there have been as many as forty regular boarding pupils, though at present there are but about a dozen. cemteries. There is a union cemetery on section ten, which is divided by an imaginary line into two equal parts, one-half of which belongs to the Roman Catholics, and the other half to the German Luth erans and the German Methodists, who hold the north part, which is on the farm of Jacob Semer ling, and the other is on the farm of F. Glassert. This arrangement was made about 1870. The first burial, however, was in 1859, a son of Fred. Glas sert, who was about twelve years of age. The establishment must have cost from $6,000 to $8,000. The first priest in attendance was Rev. Father Neubrandt, and Father Mathew, as he was caded, was also here. The Rev. Father C. Walker is the present priest. Services are held in an audience room in the convent and from seventy to eighty families pro cure spiritual consolation here. HOKAH LIBRARY. This is one of the institutions of the vidage to which the citizens point with more or less pride. The academy has 200 acres of land in the north east corner of section twenty-eight. The building is a large one of stone, three stories in height, with a basement and an annex as a residence for the priest and the chapel. The church is known as St. Mary's, and superceeded St. Joseph's above aduded to. There is a small burial place for the sisters and the priests, and the remains of a single priest and two sisters, he mouldering beneath the sod. Just after the middle of the last decade, the idea of having a pubdc hbrary was started, and public entertainments were projected and carried into execution, and other means were employed to raise the requisite funds, which were successful, and a goodly number of books were procured. A smad fee is charged for the use of the books, which are extensively read. SCHOOLS. Another cemetery was consecrated about the year 1873, in which about twenty graves have been made, the first being for the wife of J. G. Streigel. Village School. \u2014 In the winter of 1855 and '56, a school was started in Masonic Hall, the rod of authority being wielded by Miss Emily Pond. The next winter the sceptre was in the hands of Mrs. D. L. Clements. In 1857, a house and lot was purchased and converted into a schoolhouse, which served the purpose up to 1867, when the present house was built, which has, however, since received an addition. A New Catholic Church. \u2014 In the spring of 1881, a church was built on Main Street, in the vidage of Hokah. The budding is a neat struc ture, and is occupied, when meetings are held, by Father Peter Bernard, of Lrescent. The church has not yet been dedicated. District No. 13. \u2014 In 1857 or '58, a smad log schoolhouse was put up on what is caded \"the Ridge,\" in section ten, by the German Catholics who had settled in that vicinity. This was on the farm of V. Bierden. It was a subscription school, Baptist. \u2014 The first Baptist church of Hokah was organized in 1856, by Elder Griffiths. The first pastor was Rev. Wildam Card, who was fol lowed by Elder Carr. After an interval Elder"], [409, "HOKAH TOWNSHIP. 395 and was taught one season by a Catholic priest. It was generally known as the \"convent.\" It is now used as a granary by Mr. F. Glassert. After wards a log house was laid up near by, as a pub dc school building, and the school was opened by Jacob Schonhard. This was on the land of John Ahrens, and was used up to the year 1876, when the present frame building was erected on the same section. This building cost about $400. school at Detroit, and after graduating learned the trade of a miller at Saline. In 1872, he re moved to Minneapolis, and the fodowing year to Winnebago City, thence to Lanesboro, Fillmore county, and in 1874 to this place, where, for five years he had charge of the Crescent Mill. He was united in marriage with Miss Rodah A. Mc- Spadden, daughter of W. G. McSpadden, one of the pioneers of Houston county, the ceremony dating the 26th of March, 1875. The fruits of this union are two boys. In 1879, Mr. Brooks became a partner in the ownership of the Gram pian Merchant Mdl, which interest he still retains. District No. 73. \u2014 This is a joint district, a part of it being in Brownsville. It came into ex istence in about 1866, the initial school being in an old log structure belonging to Ira Butterfield, and was presided over by Miss Helen Butterfield. About the same time a schoolhouse was budt, at a total outlay of $100. The settlers turned out, and bringing material, put up the building, which is on section eight, and there are about twenty pupils. ( O. C. Bellrood was born in Norway on the 13th of October, 1824. He learned the shoemaker trade in the city of Christiana, and in 1844, he came to America. After a residence of several years in Wisconsin, first in Milwaukee and then at the old Fort Winnebago, (now Portage) engaged at his trade, he went to California. Remained two years and returned to Wisconsin, opening a grocery store in Preston. In 1862, Mr. Bed rood enlisted in the Second Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry Company E, serving over three years, dur ing which time he was confined five months in the Andersonvide prison. On his return from the army he resided in La Crosse, Wisconsin, until 1874, when he came to this town and has since been engaged in the boot and shoe business, in which he has a good trade and carries a fine stock. District No. 91. \u2014 A German subscription school was first taught by Miss Hafner, at her brother's house on section twenty-nine. This must have been about 1861. After this, perhaps about 1865, Rev. Father F. X. Neubrandt had a school a single winter. The district itself was or ganized the latter part of the last decade, and a frame house was put up for school purposes at a cost of about $400. It is not a large school, there being not over fifteen pupils in attendance, BIOGRAPHICAL. Jacob Becker is a native of Germany, born on the 25th of September, 1832.

In 1867, he came to America, and located in Mdwaukee, where he was engaged as clerk for a short time, then moved to Michigan, and had charge of the financial affairs of an extensive lumbering firm. Miss Clara L. Bowers became the wife of Mr. Joys in November, 1875, the fruits of which union were two boys one of whom is living.

Mr. and Mrs. Muir are the parents of four children. Ferdinand Sobek is a native of Austria, bom on the 19th of April, 1846. He learned the tador trade at which he was engaged in his native coun try until coming to America in 1867. He came direct to Wisconsin, first locating in Milwaukee, then in Hartford, and a few months later in Prai rie du Chien, from which place he moved to Du buque, Iowa. In 1870, he came to this place and opened a shop with a very small capital, but by industry and economy has increased his business from year to year, until now he has a large trade and keeps a first-class merchant tailoring establish ment. On the 9th of June, 1874, Mr. Sobek was joined in marriage with Miss Kate Boehm, the fruits of which union are two children. William James, deceased, was one of the first settlers in this town, and laid out in an early day what has since been known as \"James' Addi tion.\" He was a native of Germany and came to America, locating in Illinois in 1842. He remained ten years and then came to this place, taking a claim in section thirty-four. In 1854, he removed ta section five, the present residence of his son-in law, Jacob Becker, and laid out a portion of his farm in town lots. He enlisted soon after the out break of the war, and on his way south was acci dentally shot. Mr. James had four daughters, three of whom are living in this county and one in Iowa. H. H. Snure, one of the active business men of this town, was born in Canada West on the 23d of December, 1841. His father died when our sub ject was quite young, and when fourteen years of age he came with his mother to Illinois, where he remained until coming to Hokah in 1865. For a few years he resided with his brother, engaging in f ami labor, then entered the employ of the railroad company, and two years later, formed a partner ship with W. F. Weber in the hardware business, to which he has since given his attention. The maiden name of his wife was Lilla A. Weber, who has borne him four children. In 1 880, Mr. Snure was elected to the State Legislature, and in Nov ember, 1881, tendered his resignation, to accept that of County Treasurer, in which office he began his duties in March, 1882. Levi T. Lyon is a native of New York, born in Delaware county, on the 31st of January, 1832. At the age of seventeen years he went to the western part of the State and learned the carpen- ter trade, returning to Delaware county about 1852. While there he rented an iron foundry which he operated for a time, and also gave some attention to his trade. He was joined in matri- mony on the 4th of July, 1852, with Miss Mar- garet Dunn. They soon after came to Wisconsin, where Mr. Lyon was engaged as carpenter and millwright. In 1858, he moved to McGregor, Iowa, where remained nine years and then came to this town. For several years after coming. here he was employed by the railroad company, but for the past few years has been engaged in the drug and grocery business. Two children have been born to him, but one of whom is dving. Joseph Stelzig is a native of Germany, born in Austria on the 25th of December, 1844. In 1857, he came with his parents to America, locating in La Crosse county, Wis., where he learned the black smith trade and remained about ten years. Miss Dorothy J. Schafer became his wife on the 4th of November, 1872. In 1874, they moved to Hokah and Mr. Stelzig engaged in the blacksmith busi ness in company with James McLaughlin. After a continuation of about three years the firm dis solved partnership, and Mr. Stelzig, purchasing the interest of his former partner, has since con ducted the business alone. Mr. and Mrs. Stelzig have had four children, three of whom are hv ing. Archie Muir was born in Milwaukee, Wis- consin, of Scotch parentage, on the 4th of Feb- ruary, 1850. When quite young he learned the cooper trade, at which he was engaged in his native place until the age of twenty-one years. He then removed to La Crosse, and from thence to Racine, where he remained a year. On the 5th of December, 1871, he was married to Miss Zuleku Cleveland. They resided four years in Neillsville, Wisconsin, then came to Winona, where Mr. Muir entered the employ of Doud, Son & Co., of that place, in 1876. Three years later he was given the general management of their business at Hokah, having discharged his duties with much A. J. Snure was born in Canada West on the 25th of October, 1847.

In 1866, he joined the engineer corps of the Southern Minnesota Rail road Company, was engaged as fireman the fol lowing year, and three years later, as engineer, which position he retained until 1877. In the lat ter year he settled in this town and opened his present sample room. erected a shanty, built a saw-mill, and commenced the improvement of the Hokah water power, upon which he has since spent thousands of dollars. Mr. Thompson has always been identified with county as well as local interests. In 1854, he trav eled many mdes through this and adjoining counties, circulating a petition for the building of the Southern Minnesota Railroad, of which he was appointed master mechanic in 1865, resigning the office in 1870. He was the first County Treasurer, first Postmaster at Hokah, and Justice of the Peace of the old territorial precinct, besides filling many other offices. In 1873 and '74, he was a member of the State Senate from this district. He is one of the oldest Masons in the State, and a charter member of Hokah Lodge, No. 17. His present wife was Mrs. Orinda Hulburt, and they have three children. Mr. Thompson had six children by his first marriage, only four of whom are living. Dr. Hamilton B. Train is a native of St. Law rence county, New York, born on the 26th of April, 1825. During the year 1847, he studied medicine in Wisconsin, then located in Fond du Lac, where he was engaged in preaching the gos pel. His health soon failed, and he was obliged to abandon the ministry, after which he attended the Appleton University for a short time. He then returned to Fond du Lac, where he was united in matrimony with Miss Angelina Clark, the mar riage dating the 27th of March, 1850. In 1856, he came to Minnesota, and the following year to Hokah, since which time he has given his atten tion to the practice of medicine. Their union has been blessed with four children, two of whom are dving. Susan M. Thompson, deceased, the former wife of the subject of our last sketch, died on the 19th of September,1862,at the age of thirty-three years. In October, 1851, she came with her little family to this then uninhabited region, to encounter the cares,burdens, privations,and roughness of pioneer life, which she endured with a cheerfulness, and bravery that won all hearts, and endeared her to every one whose good fortune it was to share her hospitality. For twelve months she was the only white woman in Hokah, but with buoyant hope fulness she met every requirement, and when she passed to the \"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,\" there were lonely and aching hearts, keenly feeling the individual and codective loss to the whole community. Edward Thompson, the first settler in what is now Hokah, and one of the first in the county, is a native of Canada, born only a short distance from the falls of Niagara. His parents moved to Lon don, Middlesex county, where Edward received his education. In 1842, they removed to Winnebago county, Hlinois, which was their home for several years, Edward learning the machinist trade, after which he was engaged in the manufacture of woolen goods. On the 11th of July, 1849, he was united in marriage with Miss Susan M. Jenks, who died on the 19th of September, 1862. In 1851, while looking for a mill site, he passed through Iowa into this county, just west of the present village of Caledonia, following the Indian trad until he reached the South Fork of Root River. There he and two others hewed out a wal nut canoe, in which they came down the river to the Mississippi, reaching the present site of Brownsvide at night. They stopped at a cabin owned by Job Brown, but finding no one at home, were obliged to sleep on the frosty ground. On the return of Mr. Brown, at his suggestion, Mr. Thompson staked out a claim at the mouth of what is now known as Thompson's Creek, where Hokah village now stands. He immediately S. P. White, who has been identified with the milling interests of this place for the past four years, was born in Rochester, New York, on the 26th of September, 1821. When he was an infant his parents moved to what was called the \"East ern Township,\" in Lower Canada, just across the northern dne of Vermont. In his boyhood he attended the public school in his town, and after wards graduated at Derby Seminary, Vermont. In 1848, he came to Wisconsin, locating in Madison, where he was engaged in mercantile pursuits, real estate, money loaning, etc. In the latter place his marriage with Miss Lydia M. Bodwell took place in 1849. In 1875 they moved to Lansing, Iowa, where Mr. White was engaged iu the operation of"], [413, "HOUSTON TOWNSHIP. 399 a flouring mill, which he conducted until coming to this place in 1878. He has since been in com pany with his brother, the firm name being S. P. & E. V. White. to Iowa, and the fodowing year came to Hokah and opened the first shoe shop in the place. In 1868, he sold his shoe store, and in company with D. L. Clements, opened a general mercantile house, continuing in the business several years. His present partner is A. J. Snure, with whom he is engaged in the. sale of hardware, grain, and ad kinds of produce. Since 1868, Mr. Weber has been Postmaster, has also been Chairman of the board of Supervisors for the past sixteen years, County Commissioner for four years and was in the State Legislature one year. W. F. Weber, a business man wed known throughout the county, is a native of Germany, born in Prussia on the 12th of January, 1824. His father died in the \"Old Country,\" and in 1838, Mr. Weber and his mother came to America. They located in Dayton, Ohio, where W. F. learned the shoemaker's trade, and was afterward employed as joururneyman for six years. In 1856, he moved HOUSTON. larly formed bluffs, rising from the bottom lands to corresponding plateaus reaching back to the next valley. CHAPTER LVI. DESCRIPTIVE REMINISCENCES EARLY SETTLEMENT The town, as now bounded, is eight miles long in the southern portion, along the Root River, and seven mdes from north to south for a width of four miles on the eastern side. The river courses to the east through the longest part of the town, with its accompanying valley. Silver Creek also has its valley, which is called \"Looney Valley,\" whether on account of the peculiar beauty of its moonlight scenes, the effect of a residence there upon the people, or in deference to an old settler, it perhaps matters little. The South Fork of Root River has also its characteristic valley, and this is called in honor of some of the early settlers \"Swede Bottom.\" EMBRYOT10 VILLAGES TOWN ORGANIZATION VILLAGE ORGANIZATION MANUFACTURING CHURCHES SCHOOLS BIOGRAPHICAL. This town, with a name identical with that of the county, is on the northern tier of townships, being the third from the Mississippi River, with Winona county on the north, Mound Prairie on the east, Sheldon and Yucatan on the south, and Money Creek on the west. It is made up from three government townships, but is a fraction of a section less than one of these in its aggregate amount of territory; and the arrangement is such that it takes in the valleys of the water courses consisting of the Root River and the south fork thereof, and Silver Creek, a branch coming down from the north to unite with Root River near the The boundaries of the town, as will be perceived, have been so arranged that the vdlage is easdy ac cessible by the citizens from any part by fodow ing the valleys, as along these the roads are laid, and most of the cultivated farms are on these in terval lands, or in close proximity. eastern boundary of the town. The Root River was formerly navigable, but mills and bridges have cut off this method of transportation, and a sunken steamer, opposite the upper part of town, is the only reminder that Hous ton was once a seaport town. These vadeys have sod of pecrdiar richness, and the surface is usuady quite level, but sometimes inclined to be rolling. Near the head of the va rious branches the sod is stid more valuable for The physical features of the town are in accord ance with the peculiarities of this whole region.

Decay, except as to the bones, was at last com plete, and some enterprising ethnologist procured the skull, which is said to have indicated a good mental development. The rude tomb itself was final ly demolished, and the chieftain's bones scattered about. During the war, at a 4th of July celebra tion a liberty pole was planted on the spot, but that also has succumed to the ravages of time. A Mr. Butterfield, who died here at an early day, was buried there in an unmarked grave. The Soil. \u2014 As to the peculiarities of the soil, in the valleys it is a dark, clayey loam, with patches of a sandy loam. In the steep decdvities the vegetable moidd, as it is deposited, is washed among, so that the character of the soil cannot be commended, except in certain places where a growth of shrubs or trees have arrested this deter gent operation. In such places there is a certain amount of fertility, and on the river bottoms, at various points, there is a large growth of good timber, such as oak, elm, walnut, etc EARLY SETTLEMENT. Not unlike many other towns in the county, the year 1852 is the date of the first colonization of this town, and during that year the immigration thither was quite active. Crops. \u2014 During the first few years the colon ists were most anxious to raise something to eat, for themselves and families, without regard to a market, except in their own cellars or lofts. But after having the most imperative personal wants supplied, attention was turned toward raising something to sell, and the first experiment in wheat more than met the reasonable expectations of the settlers. Thirty or more bushels to the acre was not uncommon. But year after year the crop grew less, and corn has now usurped its place with marked good results. There seems to be preponderating amount of evidence that the very first white man attracted to the locality, to mark out a claim, was W. G. Mc- Spadden, who had spent some time in New York State, and who had came up the Root River from La Crosse on the 14th of June, 1852, and staked out eighty acres on what afterwards was found to be section thirty-three, on the eastern part of the southeast quarter. But of course his eighty did not coincide with the government survey, for it was sadly cut up. Here, with visions of a flourishing city in the not very dim distance spread out before him, he platted a town site, and, although his en deavors were crowned with some measure of suc cess, he is still waiting while the shadows longer grow, for the fud fruition of his plans. Indians. \u2014 When the early settlers arrived, there was a vidage of the Winnebagoes situated on a bend in the river near the lower village. There was a score or two of their rude habitations, and they seemed to be a discouraged band, who felt, in a sort of insensible way, the impending fate that was hanging over the race. They gave the new comers no trouble, except by their impertinent begging, unless stimulated by \"fire water,\" which was bartered to them for their peltries, and then sometimes night and day would become hideous with their baechanalian revels. The location was most admirable, just above the confluence of the South Fork of the Root River with the main stream, which was easily navigable from the Mississippi, and no one, who could not peer into the future, could have predicted at that time that this would not become one of the great western cities. As it proved, the fates decreed that a small village should grow up here, which two years thereafter had the ambition to become the county seat of the rapidly developing southeast ern portion of Minnesota. Reminiscence. \u2014 Near the ferry, in section thirty -one, is a hill formed by a point of the table land, which has been known since the early settle ment as the \"Indian mound,\" from the circum stance that the remains of an Indian chief whose soul had presumably gone to the happy hunting grounds, was found sitting on this elevation, sup ported by some stakes driven into the ground, and a log pen budt over him in a thorough wolf proof manner. And there this emblem of mortality Finady, as the years rolled by, the Southern Minnesota railroad came through, and the influ ence to secure the station on an addition to the west of the village prevailed, and so the -village of Houston was moved, and the original town became"], [415, "HOUSTON TOWNSHIP. 401 \"Old Houston,\" which may have outlived its use fulness, but is stdl honored for its good deeds in the past. was a Mr. Hyatt, who also arrived in 1852, and was a squatter on the eastern branch of Silver Creek. He kept his eye on a large tract of land, intending to hold it until his sons and other rela tives could come and occupy it, but, for some reason, his expectations did not materialize, and so he quietly withdrew from the scene of his fond anticipations. While he was still here, another settler with three sons, who had staying qualities, came up the river from La Crosse and invaded this tempting vadey. The head of this family with the right kind of material for pioneer life was John S. Looney, and he promptly put up a shanty on sec tion twenty-seven, where the farm of A. B. Hunt now is. That the claims of each might be defined, and that there should be no disputed territory, the two claimants blazed a line of trees across the centre of the valley, and thus modestly divided the whole tract between them. Mr. McSpadden, with an untiring energy that never faltered, returned to La Crosse, where he operated a ferry, and exercised his opportunities to induce settlers to go up Root River, and he divided his time between the two points untd 1854, when he settled down to remain, and he is still a resident, but not on the old claim. Mr. McSpad den came up the river at first on foot, and on the second journey he was accompanied by Ole Knud son, from Norway, who, in the primitive style of those times pre-empted a claim adjoining Mc- Spadden's on the east, running around 160 acres, and erecting a shanty on what afterwards came into section thirty-four. The shanty, according to an equitable arrangement, was on McSpadden's land, but this building in due time, became a store, and with McSpadden's building played a prominent part in the history of those primitive pioneer days. Mr. Looney had been to the lead mines at Ga lena, and afterwards at La Crosse, where he worked land upon which that city is now built. He was a public spirited man, and was always at the front in every laudable enterprise. He remained for about six years when he . went to Dubuque, and from there to Hlinois, where it is understood he still lives. As to his sons ; James took land near the old gentleman on the south, and left it about that time; Corydon and Abraham also secured land near, but spent most of their time on the Missis sippi River. Abraham now lives in Winona and is still steamboating, while Corydon is somewhere on the Pacific coast. This famdy gave th.e name to the valley. Mr. Walter Webster came up the same month with McSpadden, on one of his excursions, and he took a claim to the west of the others, on the southwestern part of section thirty-three,, where the village of Houston now stands. He, however, made no improvements, but lived through the winter of 1852 and '53 in McSpadden's shanty. The next season he sold all his right, title, and interest to David Johnson for $30, and it was subsequently sold to Mons Anderson, the present proprietor of part of it. Mr. Johnson' at once commenced making im provements, and put up a block-house, which stdl stands between the railroad track and the river. After awhile Mr. Johnson left and went to Good hue county, and finady to Iowa. Charles Gainer came with the Looneys, settled on section twenty-three, and there remained until the others had left. Isaac Thompson, A. B. Hunt, and Adam Coon also came at an early day, and are still residents, and honored and leading citi zens. Mr. McSpadden lives in Looney valley, and has a valuable water-power on Silver Creek. In the fall of 1853, Mr. Lars Johnson, a Swede, bought the 160 acres west of this, of David John son. This is the land upon which the extreme western part of the village is now located. A Mr. Sanborn came up about the same time Mr. Web ster came, but he did not remain long. Mr. E. K. Dyfer was another of the early claim takers, who located further up the river, but he left in a few years. Mr. Case made a claim some time in 1853, and soon sold to Mr. T. H. Conniff. A few others secured locations in the valley, and the place be came known as \"The Forks.\" It must have been in 1853, that a man whose name was pronounced Cushon, located on section twenty-five in the western part of the town. Near his place is a high peak standing out solitary and alone, as a huge sentry overlooking the valley be low and the neighboring ridges for miles around, and which used to be a landmark for travelers when this was a vast trackless region, and was named Cushon Peak. This man is remembered as an inteldgent and educated man, but from whence Looney Valley.\u2014 The very first comer here 26"], [416, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 402 he came, or whither he went, as he soon did, no one knows. He sold out on leaving, in 1854, to Mr. Hendrickson, and a few years later it passed into the hands of Mr. G. O. Laugen. town, having occupied his present atand since 1866. Andrew Forsyth was the first to move from the lower to the upper village; this was in the early autumn of 1866. Mr. Abrahamson soon fodowed, and then Mr. Horner, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Barton, D. C. Dyer, and others, took up the line of march, leaving a scene behind them for the descriptive pen of some modern Goldsmith. The Mr. Butterfield already alluded to as hav ing been buried on the Indian mound, must have taken a claim on section thirty-one, as the date of his death was in July, 1854, and this was the first death in this part of the town. A blacksmith shop was started by Peter Erick son about 1856. A hotel was opened by Mr. Hoyt in 1857, and the following year a hotel was also started by Lawrence Lynch. During the year 1853, the settlements above described received numerous accessions, and an other was formed on the east bank of the South Fork of Root River, this was the Swedish settle ment which gave the name to the locality where they still live. Those who were the pioneers of this movement, were : John Anderson, who still lives on section three, and Abraham Anderson and Ole Benson, on the same section, the latter, howev er, is dead, but his son, C. A. Benson, runs the farm. Lars Redding settled on section thirty fonr, but died in 1860. With the two Johnsons already mentioned, these make up six families, who, while still in Sweden, saw an account of the Root River valley in a local paper there, and at once started for the promising land, coming here and claiming these unoccupied acres, they at once began the creation of new homes and the cultivation of the soil. In 1857, the Post-office was established, and there should be no wonder that, with what had been so far accomplished, the most extravagant an ticipations should have been entertained as to the future of this Root River village, located, as it was, on a navigable stream in a most productive valley. At one time a shipyard was in active operation near the bridge, and quite a number of steamers were built. The First Birth. \u2014 As near as can be ascer tained, the first event of this character, was Miss Jennie, daughter of David and Johanna Johnson on an unknown day, in January or February, 1854. She died when ten or twelve years old, near Red Wing, in this State. During the year many located near the \"Forks\" in various directions. John Moore selected land south of the present village, where S. B. Mc- Intyre now lives. Moore sold to Thomas Hogarty, in 1854. Marriage. \u2014 In the early winter of 1858, Mr. Ole Benson and Mrs. Sara Anderson were married at the house of Lars Johnson, on the western part of the present vdlage of Houston. Neither of the parties are living now. Lawrence Lynch and Harvey McAdams, with a brother, also arrived in 1853. Albert Olson, H. T. Stafford, and Morris Farmin, should be put down with the early comers. These settlements have since practically grown together, as there is now no vacant land as a demarcation between them. Deaths. \u2014 The third great event in a human life, as it happened here, was the case of Abraham Anderson, whose tottering steps had brought him, at the age of seventy-three years, to the promised land, only \"to fad as the autumn leaf to enrich our mother earth.\" His death was in August, 1853, and instead of the old \u00e6sthetic idea of being \"gathered to his fathers\" he was deposited where, as the ages roll by, his children will be gathered to him. His last resting place is on a mound on the southwest of the northwest of section three. The first regular store in Houston was by Ole Knudson, who opened it in 1854, bringing his goods up from La Crosse on a keel boat, which he also owned and did a transportation business. A second store was started by Mr. Brown in the spring of 1858. This was kept a single year. Another early death should be recorded here, that of Miss Augusta Johnson, a sister of David Johnson, some twenty years of age, who was ac cideutady shot in her brother's house sometime in the year 1854. Her remains were deposited near those of the venerable Nelson. In the fall of 1858, Isaac Abrahamson arrived with a stock of about $500 worth of goods, which had been purchased from Mons Anderson, in whose store Abrahamson had been a clerk in La Crosse, and he is stid here as the senior business man in"], [417, "HOUSTON TOWNSHIP. 403 Ferry. \u2014 Since some time in 1858, a ferry had been in operation across the Root River, on sec tion thirty. It was first started by a Norwegian by the name of Henderson, and was a rope ferry with a telf-propeller, so arranged that the current would carry it over in whichever way it was headed, but this lateral wing arrangement, for some reason, is no longer available, and muscle has to take the boat from side to side. The proprietorship has changed many times. Mr. Knud Oleson is the present owner. Corydon Looney, who was sole proprietor and business manager, and, according to the accounts coming down to us, the whole stock could have been carried off in a wheelbarrow. But the goods, whatever they were, were soon transferred to D. D. Wilson, who added materially to the stock, and kept it in the same place until 1856, when he erected a large log building and put in more goods. He afterwards put up a frame building, which served a double purpose of store and resi dence. In 1858, the business was closed out, and Wilson went to Money Creek. Be was an enter prising and public spirited citizen, and served his fellow countrymen as a State Representative. EMBRYOTIO VILLAGES. The early residents of Looney valley were re markably enterprising, and strove to make their home the veiy hub of the county. Dreams of the county seat hovered over them by night, and some of their waking hours were employed in ponder ing over the question as to the proper spot for the court house and jail. So, in 1857, while the spec ulative fever was epidemic throughout the whole county, it assumed, here in Looney valley, the mild and comparatively harmless form of making paper villages. In 1856, the genial and enthusiastic pioneer, W. G. McSpadden ; \"whde high hopes of wealth and fame his bosom fired,\" laid out a city on his farm on the southeast of section twenty-three, near his mill. This city was named Winfield, in honor of General Scott, and with its prospective streets, avenues, squares, and parks, was to be truly me tropodtan in its proportions. As no one s.iould despise the day of small things, a ommeneement was made by the establishment of a saloon, and a blacksmith shop which was handled by Henry Wilson. It was only when this project had obvi ously failed, that Looneyville was projected. A town site company was organized by Messrs Looney, Hunt, and Wilson, and forty acres were solemnly set aside, surveyed and platted by Isaac Thompson, and the whole, with numerous addi tions, was promptly filled, in their mind, by a teeming population. Another Village. \u2014 Soon after Looneyvdle had been mapped out, another town site company sprung into existence, another titular city was founded by an ambitious company, among whom were Snow, Looney, Riley, Harvey Gdlett, Pol leys, and perhaps others. It was situated south of Looneyvide, on the southeast of section twenty seven and the northeast of thirty-four. Its found ers were satisfied that the railroad, which had al ready been projected, would pass through it on that side of the river, but when it did finally get through they got left on the other side. A Post-office had been established here in 1855, caded Looneyville, with D. D. Wilson as Post master. The mail was brought up by J. S. Looney. The office was kept up until 1858, when it was discontinued. This historic city, the conception of which was so pleasing tp its projectors, and which harmed no one else, was located in the center of the west half of the northwest of section twenty-six, and the east half of the northeast of section twenty-seven, twenty acres laying north of the east and west road, and ten acres on either side of the north and south road, which intercepts the other here. The exact location is thus given, so thatwhen, in some remote period, an antiquarian shall be hunting for buried cities, there may be no doubt as to the site of this one. The ruins of this deserted village, iu the form of corner lot stakes, were a cause of considerable profanity in after years when they were encountered by the knives of the mowing machine. The city was duly platted and recorded, and given the canonical name of St. Lawrence, and for a long time it was regularly assessed as city prop erty. The elder Mr. Looney came to this place in June. 1852, and the following September brought his famdy, with considerable stock, including four yoke of oxen, and two horses, with cows, etc. He was bora in Nashville, Tennessee, and when ten years of age was taken to Illinois, and came from there to this place. In crossing the Mississippi river he had to swim his stock. As early as 1855, a store had been opened by"], [418, "404 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY.

When the vidage of Houston was three years old it was described as numbering thirty-five buddings, including three storehouses, two shin gle factories, turning out from three to five thous and a day, two carpenter shops, chair factory and cabinet shop, one cooper shop, one blacksmith shop, a steam saw-mid, one com mill, a turning lathe and broom factory. A school was also men tioned, and the prospect of having a brewery, a ferry, a dozen or so more buildings, with brick yard, etc. Timber was represented as being abun dant, and land from $5.00 to $25.00 per acre. June 4th, 1861. At a special town meeting the question of raising a special sum by taxation to complete the bridge was decided in the negative by a vote of thirty against twenty-four. On the question of a special tax to pay the town indebt edness, forty-two votes in the affirmative and only two in the negative. On the 25th of March, 1862, at a meeting of the town board, the report of the Treasurer was received, by which it appears that the whole sum handled by the town Treasurer dur inn the year, was $191.97. And, as treasurer of the school district, the sum of $52.86 were the re ceipts, for handling which, the sum of $1.05 was credited to him. town government. The records of the town under the original or ganization have not been preserved, but the inci dents connected with the first governmental move ments, aside from the fact that they relate to the earliest history, are not of paramout interest. They are not unlike those of other places, and in the case of Houston, where our record must begin in 1861, at the time a new State law went into effect, even the personnel is not materiady changed in the few intervening years. At the annual town meeting held on the 1st of April, 1862, Isaac Thompson was moderator. Mr. E. Mclntire moved that a tax of $300 be levied to complete the bridge, which motion was carried; a motion also prevailed that the next annual meet ing be held at Looneyville. In January, 1862, the County Commissioners set off a part of the territory of Yucatan and joined it to Houston. After the act of re-organization was passed, the first town meeting was on the second day of April, 1861. O. Hempsted was moderator. At this meeting considerable attention was devoted to the building of Root River bridge, which was then in process of construction, and an assessment of $200 was levied to complete the structure. The following officers were declared duly elected: Su pervisors, Isaac Thompson, Chairman, Harvey Johnston, and Knud Solverson; Town Clerk, J. V. Cox; Assessor, O. Hempsted; Treasurer, M. Farmin; Justice of the Peace, T. Curtis; Consta ble, H. T. Stafford; Superintendent, A. Coon. The Judge at this election was Isaac Thompson, and J. B. Shoemaker was the Clerk. On the 10th of April, 1862, a petition was re ceived by the town board, asking that a special town meeting be called, to reconsider the vote to raise money to complete the bridge. This was signed by George Stafford, and thirteen others. On the 12th inst., another petition was received, signed by E. Mclntire and fifteen others, on the same subject, and with a view of devising some plan to complete the structure, so, on the 22d of the same month the meeting was called. It was held at the schoolhouse, and a motion to rescind the tax resolution prevailed. The annual town meeting, on the 7th of April, 1863, was held in Looneyville. After the organ ization of the meeting, it was voted to hold the next town meeting in Houston city. Aprd 13, 1861. The records of a meeting of the supervisors on this date, state that it was hol den at Looneyville. Road business and school affairs, with appropriate action to carry out the vote of the town in relation to the bridge received attention. In August, 1863, a contract was made by the board to build a bridge across the South Fork of Root River. A. S. Wilsey was the contractor. May 4th, 1861. The Board met at West Houston, and in accordance with a late law of the State, making each town a school district, to be sub-divided by local authority, the districts were rearranged by making the old No. 48 to be No. 1 ; the town war record. In February, 1864, a special meeting of the board was held to devise some plan to secure credit for Houston soldiers who had enlisted in Wisconsin Regiments, and the Chairman, D. F."], [419, "HOUSTON TOWNSHIP. 405 Case, was designated to go to Madison and learn what could be done. In order to raise the amount necessary to defray the expense, various sums were borrowed of patriotic citizens in exchange for town orders bearing ten per cent, interest. The annual report of the Treasurer, in April, 1864, re vealed the whole amount received during the year to be $236.64, and paid out, $241.98, leaving a de ficiency of $5.34. Bids weie advertised for the construction of a bridge at the lowest point named, and the contract was finady concluded with Olaus Foss for the sum of $2,950. In 1874, Alex. S. Reid was Town Clerk. In September of this year a contract was let to build a bridge across the South Fork, to Charles Benson for $375.00. An ice breaker was constructed to protect the lower bridge, at a cost of $350, by W. G. McSpadden. A special town meeting was held on the 9th of July, 1864, to see whether the town would pay a bounty to the recruits. It was voted that $100 be given to any one drafted, or who may be drafted within six months, or who may volunteer, if he is a married man, and $50 if he is single. On the 20th of August, 1864, another meeting was held in the quota interest, and $200 in town orders was voted to every one who should endst and actually become a soldier under the calls of the President, payable in town orders drawing seven per cent. Subscriptions were at once opened to cash these orders, which were liberally filled. On the 14th of March, 1876, the day of the an nual town meeting, the water was so high that the electors could not assemble, so a special meeting was called for the 18th of March, when the regu lar business was transacted. VILLAGE ORGANIZATION. The vidage of Houston was organized on the 7th of April, 1874, in accordance with an act of the legislature of the State, approved on the 19th of February, 1874. The first officers elected were: H. Rasmusson, President; A. P.Johnson, E. A. Brown, and P. Errikson, Trustees; D. F. Case, Clerk ; O.A.John son, Marshal; I. Abrahamson, Treasurer; E. A. Horner, Justice of the Peace, and G. C. Turner, Assessor. At this election D. C. Dyer was Mod erator; D. C. Sherman, Inspector, and P. Down ing, election Clerk. At an adjourned meeting of the town board on the 26th of August, the interest on the town orders was put up to twelve per cent., and a tax of $2,500 was assessed to pay the bounties. At another meeting held on the following day, it was re ported that $475 had been handed in as a loan, and $760 on volunteer subscriptions, and on the 29th of August, it was voted that $300 be paid any drafted man who had contributed $10 or up ward to the volunteer fund. The board procured a vidage seal, and proceeded to administer the affairs of the village by passing appropriate ordinances. The licenses for saloons have been fixed at various times at from $75 to $125. For several years the price has been $100, and with the revenue thus derived the vidage ex penses are usually paid without a resort to a direct tax. The officers have been selected from among the best citizens, and there has been no malfeasance or defalcation in office. On the 11th of February, 1865, a town meeting was held to see if a special tax should be levied for bounty purposes, and fifty-two persons voted, twenty for the proposition, and thirty-two against it, so it was lost. The question was again tested on the 11th of March, and sixty-nine votes were cast, twenty-seven for the proposition, and forty -two against it, so it was again defeated. This seems to have been the end of the trouble in fiding the quota. The last village officers elected were: Presi dent, L. A. Tennison; Trustees, A. S. Reid, C. Rasmusson, O. Olson, and S. S. Drake; Clerk, M. A. Dieson; Treasurer, Herman Swanson; Assessor, P. Bjornson, who was elected, but died on the 22d of Aprd, 1881, and A. S. Reid was appointed to the vacancy; Justices of the Peace, J. W. Tim monson and Thomas Ryan; Marshal, Thomas Parish was elected but resigned, and L. White house was appointed in his place. OTHER TOWN AFFAIRS. On the 11th of April, 1872, a town meeting was held to see about budding a bridge at the Loon eyville road, and it was resolved to budd one at that place, and another at the ferry. It was also voted to issue $10,000 in bonds, to build county buddings, provided the county seat should be moved to Houston. Mr. Smith was Town Clerk at this time, and Isaac Thompson, Chairman. THE VILLAGE PLAT. The old vdlage of Houston, which, by courtesy"], [420, "406 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. is now called Lower Houston, was the east eighty of the southwest of section thirty-three, claimed by McSpadden. The west half was then \"Crooks ton,\" The west half of the southwest of section thirty-four was owned by Ole Knudson, and a small strip on section thirty -three. connection with a flutter wheel, and could run through a thousand feet of inch boards in a day. Mr. Eli Baker bought an interest in the mill, but soon re-sold to McSpadden who run it alone for a time. It was afterwards operated by different parties up to the close of the war, when it was finally shut down as a saw-mid. This mid was ready of great value to the village of Houston and to the farmers for miles around. West of the above described property, there was 160 acres taken by David Johnson, a Swede, in 1853, and west of this, 160 acres was taken by Lars Johnson. Both of these parties subsequently sold to Mons Anderson of La Crosse. David Johnson's claim was originally taken by Mr. W. Webster, who sold it, in 1853, for $30. This tract is now the vdlage of Houston. Wakefield Flouring Mill. \u2014 In 1865 and '66, Mr. McSpadden put up a flouring mill at the old saw-mill dam, securing about seventeen- feet fall. The mill was 30x40 feet, two stories high, with a basement, and was propelled by a turbine wheel. It did good work until 1874, when a flood swept it away. It is stated that when the Southern Minnesota railroad was laid through here, that Mr. Anderson gave seventy acres of land and thus secured the station, which involved the removal of the village to where it now is. With an enterprise which was most commendable, Mr. McSpadden at once put up another and a su perior mill of the same size, aud placed in it three run of stones, with an oat meal attachment. It was driven by an improved turbine wheel under a tweenty feet head, and had a capacity of fifty barrels a day. This mill run with varied success until December, 1878, when it was destroyed by fire, and has not been rebuilt. POST-OFFICE. As early as 1857 a Post-office was secured, Mr. A. Marsh was the first Postmaster. At Looney ville the Postmaster was Dr. Wilson, as elsewhere mentioned, and was discontinued after a few years when it was found that that village did not mate rialize. In 1866, the Post-office took its turn in moving to the new location, aud was transferred, building and all; this was while Mr. Marsh was yet Postmaster. L. A. Tennison was the next incumbent of the office, and then D. F. Case, who was fodowed by the present officer, F. N. Good rich. The receipts of the office are about, $200 per quarter. While Dana F. Case was Postmas ter, in 1871, it was made a money order office. The first order issued was on the 3d of August, to Ly man R. Hall for the sum of $30, payable to Brad ley & Metcalf, Mdwaukee, Wisconsin. The first month there were twenty-four orders issued. In December, 1881, the number of orders issued was one hundred and nineteen. The Redding Flouring and Saw-mill. \u2014 This mdl is on the South Fork of Root River in section thirty-four, about one mile east of Houston vidage. On this spot a saw-mill was commenced about the year 1867, and completed two years afterwards by E. W. and Charles Hoyt. In 1871, this property was bought by Mr. N. A. Redding who has since run the mill, which has a circular saw with a ca pacity of 3,000 feet per day, and is driven by water. In 1875, Mr. Redding commenced the erection of a flouring mill adjoining the saw-mill; it is 30x 40 feet, two stories in height, and has two run of stones and a capacity of thirty barrels a day. It has a head of six feet, and a turbine wheel trans mits the power. In 1879, a run of feed stones was introduced, and the whole estabdshment is run as a custom mill. MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES. At an early day Mr. McSpadden, realizing the value of water-power, secured the south half of the southeast of section twenty -three which em braced a fine undeveloped power of twelve feet head, on Sdver Creek, So he set himself at work in his usual vigorous way, and succeeded, in 1855, in improving his property, and by 1856, he had his saw-mill in operation. It was an old fashion ed vertical frame saw, driven directly by a crank Saw-mill and Machine Shop. \u2014 Sometime in 1867 or '68, a shop was put up on the farm of Charles Smith on section thirty -six, in the western part of the town. Blacksmithing utensils were put in at first, and after a while an engine and turning lathe, making quite a machine shop, which was managed by Mr. Simeon Todd. In 1872, Mr. Todd and Mr. Smith erected a saw-mdl with a"], [421, "HOUSTON TOWNSHIP. 407 good sized steam engine for power, and with a re ciprocating saw began operations and kept it in motion for about two years, when some of the machinery was sold, and the rest lays along the roadside as corroding emblems of departed useful ness. once proceeded to put his plans into operation. He procured a plantation cane crusher, with a capacity of 200 gallons of syrup a day, and this was connected with an overshot water wheel, uti lizing the old dam. He also procured a large Cook evaporator and other necessary machinery, and his success has been quite phenomenal. He has all the necessary appurtenances and fixtures for settling, cooling, and storing the amber sweet ness. In the season of 1881, he made 4,250 gal lons of syrup of very superior quadty. This is evidently the best plan for the farmers, to raise the cane, and have it manufactured without loss or danger of failure, by an expert in the business. Houston Roller Fouring Mill. \u2014 In 1875, Wm. H. Gorsland commenced the erection of a flouring mill on the Root River, on the northern edge of the village of Houston, and in May, 1877, it was put in operation at a cost of about $40,000, and run through the summer as a custom mid. At that time it had six run of stones. In the fall of that year he began the manufacture of merchant flour, and some months subsequently disposed of a two-thirds undivided interest in the whole prop erty to Williams & Fad. The new firm thus created proceeded to make additions to the mid by adding 20 feet in length to the original budding, which was 36x40 feet, so that the mill is now 36x60 feet, four stories high and a basement, and a side track from the railroad to the mill was built. This enlargement made room for six more run of stones. In August, 1880, Mr. W. W. Cargill bought the working interest of Mr. Gorsland. The mill was about this time converted into a roller mill, and the machinery, as then arranged and still operated, consists of three run of stones, seven sets of corrugated and six sets of smooth rolls, one separator, one smutter, one cockle machine, nine purifiers, and other appliances requisite for the production of the finer grades of flour. It has a capacity of from 250 to 300 barrels per day, and is run continuously, except Sundays, with two sets of employes. The mill has a good water power, with eight feet head, and seven improved tur bine wheels keep the machinery in motion. In connection with this mill there is a cooper shop, which employs ten or twelve men. This manufac turing establishment is, of course, by far the most important in the town, contributes largely to the prosperity of the village, and furnishes a large proportion of the freight from this station. The firm name is now Wdliams, Cargill & Fall. They are extensive grain dealers, Mr. Reid being their purchasing agent. BUSINESS DIRECTORY. D. C.

The earliest rehgious society organized was shortly after the settlement of Swede Bottom. It was a Swedish Baptist church, and was invoked into existence on the 18th of August, 1853, with a membership of nine, under the inspiring leader ship of Rev. F. O. Nelson, a sketch of whose hfe appears elsewhere in this volume. It seems that he drank deeply of a new found faith on coming to this country, but subsequently, not only threw this up, but all other theological teaching he had previously imbibed, even forbidding that rehgious services should be held at his funeral.

Then Rev. John Brack took charge, and remained for about seven years. For some time there has been no regular service. As to the supply for this pulpit, Rev. D. Frisk took charge in 1856, and continued one year, gathering two additional members. In October, 1858, Rev. A. Norelius assumed the place, and wrought among this people up to the 12th of June, 1859, introducing ten new members. From this time up to October 1861, Abraham Anderson was the leader, when Rev. John Anderson became the minister, and he is stid in charge of the little flock. Lutheran Evangelical Church. \u2014 In 1874, or about that time, services in this interest were com menced, and a society was got together. In 1881, it was re-organized, and now has about ten fami des in the society. The supply is from La Crosse and there is service at the schoolhouse once in three weeks. Among the clergymen who have at tended are Rev. P. Nelson, Rev. O. C. Schonhool, Rev. P. Ostley, and Rev. J. A. Berg. The society seems to be in a healthy condition although not large. Looney Valley Baptist Society. \u2014 At an early day, meetings were held for a few months at the schoolhouse by a Mr. Hamlin, and after awhile a missionary from Money Creek, Mr. Corey, came over and held services at the lower schoolhouse, and at the residences of the settlers. This was kept up for a year or so, when, in the winter of 1857-58, an organization was effected at the house of Andrew Samuelson on section fourteen, and after the upper schoolhouse was completed, meet ings were held there, but in time the society ceased to exist. Episcopal Church. \u2014 The Church of Our Savior was built about 1866, at the lower part of the present vdlage. It is a neat but not large structure. Among the pastors who have officiated here may be named, Rev. Mr. Powell, Rev. Mr. Spor, Rev. Mr. Cowdrey, and the present pastor, Rev. Mr. Gurr, who resides in Brownsville and holds services here every third Sunday. Houston Free Baptist Church. \u2014 During the fall of 1878, Rev. Daniel D. Mitched, who was a clergyman stationed at Money Creek, had ap pointments at Houston, and on the 14th of Feb ruary, 1879, an organization was effected at the house of John B. Gerard, with ten members. Charles Smith was chosen deacon,and J. B. Gerard, Clerk. In September of that year, the Rev. J. B. Palmer, with the pastor, Mr. Mitchell, held a series of meetings, and a large number of mem bers were added to the church. At first the church was auxiliary to the Money Creek Society, but on the 5th of December, 1879, an independ ent society was instituted. The United Brethren in Christ. \u2014 The moving spirit in an attempt to build up this church was a Mr. Miner, who began expounding the gospel, as he understood it, in 1859, using the upper school house as a meeting place, and he succeded in arousing considerable interest. His efforts were supplemented by Caleb Addleman. Afterwards Rev. Mr. Dingerman, and then Rev. Mr. Jones oc cupied the pulpit, but in the course of eight or nine years this organization also ceased to exist. Methodist. \u2014 Rev. Mr. Wagner commenced holding meetings in the lower schoolhouse some time during the last of the decade of 1860, preaching through the winter and a part of the following summer. Rev. Mr. Ransom was after wards here, then Mr. Wagner returned for a time, but there is now no organization. In May, 1880, Mr. Mitched was called to a church near Minneapolis, where he remained un til May, 1881, when he returned, and is now in charge of this society and that at Money Creek, with an appointment for a single service at Yuca tan every alternate Sunday. On the reorganiza tion, Charles Smith and John B. Gerard were made Deacons; George Wdson, Treasurer, and J. John son, Clerk. For a part of the time, while Mr. Mitchell was away, Mr. L. Gibbon was pastor. Deacon Charles Smith, an estimable man and Christian worker, died on the 5th of June, 1880. The society occupies the Presbyterian church, and has forty members. Presbyterian Church.\u2014 In the year 1860, a society was organized with but five members. The meetings were first held at the schoolhouse. The Rev. Sheldon Jackson and the Rev. Mr. Lyon, now Superintendent of missions, were sometimes here. Rev. Mr. Hendren, Rev. Mr. Frothingham, Rev. Mr. Cunningham, and others, labored in this vineyard, holding meetings in the schoolhouse until about 1869, when the society succeeded in"], [424, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 410 Roman Catholic \u2014 On the 10th of June, 1872, the Rev. Mathew Stuerenberg appointed Thomas Vernott, Michael Shields, and Michael McCan, a building committee with full power to codecs money and to contract for budding a church ac cording to plans and specifications furnished. On the 27th of June, 1874, the committee arranged with Mr. O. Foss, of Rushford, to build, according to the plans furnished by Mr. Ross, of La Crosse, a church, 24x40 feet, with sixteen feet post, to be completed by the 14th of October. SCHOOLS. The general\" history of the rise, progress, and present condition of the schools in the town of Houston, is almost, in its salient points, a dupli cate of that of any other town in the county that may be mentioned. District No. 16. \u2014 The original schoolhouse of this district was a frame building, constructed on section thirty-one. The railroad right of way passes over the old spot. It was a most important institution, being the meeting house and public hall for the time. Revivals and four days meet ings were not uncommon, the Baptists taking the lead. In 1878, a new one was built a few rods south of where the old one stood. The sum of $1,360 was to be paid for complet ing the outside and the floor, to be paid in two in stallments. The church was not finally completed untd 1877, and the present seats were introduced in 1880. The whole cost of the structure was about $2,000. There are about twenty-five fami lies who attend upon the ministrations of this church. The Village School, District No. 15. \u2014 The first school was in an old shanty formerly used by Mr. Joel Marsh in lower town, near the bank of the river, west of the present bridge, it was in about 1855. It is likely that the first school here was taught by Miss Leonard, afterwards Mrs. George Tyler. When the village was transplanted to its present location, the school, of course, fol lowed it, and after a time a good schoolhouse was erected on the southern margin of the vidage, where a graded school is now maintained. It has two good rooms with a seating capacity of 160, with modern benches, fixtures, and appliances. At an early day occasional meetings were held once in four weeks or so, usually in the house of James Haley. Rev. Father Cornelius, was here for a time. Now Rev. P. Pernin, who lives in La Crescent, is the pastor. MASONIC. Mystic Circle Lodge, No. 78. Instituted on the 23d of October, 1868. Charter granted on the 13th of January, 1869. The first officers were E. H. Kennedy, W. M.; W. S. Case, S. W.; Eugene Marshall, J. W. This lodge flourished for awhile, but on account of removals, it had such a small membership that the charter and paraphernalia were finally surrendered to the Grand Lodge. F. N. Goodrich was the last master of the ledge. Reguiescat in pace. The school now has enrolled 145 pupils. The divisions are primary, intermediate, and grammer, taught by two gentlemen, Mr. D. B. Jewett, the principal, who has charge of the upper depart ment, and Mr. H. B. Russell, of the lower depart ment. Mr. S. P. Gale, a former principal, died in the fad of 1881. The school is a credit to the town. CEMETERIES. District No. 10. \u2014 The first schoolhouse put up was in 1854 or '55. It was constructed on the co-operative plan. The neighbors got together, bringing the material and their dinners, and hav ing a regular pic-nic. The affair was 14x20 feet, and the benches were benches indeed, long, four legged backless stools. The first school was taught by Miss Angelina Sperry, of Hamilton, now Money Creek. There was quite an atten dance of scholars. It was afterwards held in the vacated store of Mr. Wdson. This was the school house until the present brick structure was laid up which cost about $800. It is located in section twenty-three. There are several cemeteries in Houston, and one on the road to Sheldon, at the Lutheran church.

After a residence of two years in Watertown, they moved to Houston county and were among the first set tlers of Money Creek. Lafayette, the subject of this sketch, was united in marriage with Miss Etta Briggs, the ceremony taking place on the 25th of December, 1869. The union has been blessed with three children, Laura B., Jennie M., and Coralin. In 1875, both families came to this place, since which time our subject has been en gaged in the livery business. Mr. Whitehouse is the second of four brothers; Jermain E., the oldest, resides at Money Creek, Edgar is dead, and Charles V., the youngest, owns a restaurant and grocery store in this place.

Back from this are the ridges, the bluffs, the dunes, and the conical shaped hdls, -with the intervening ra vines. The great ravine of the town is that of the Winnebago River, which comes in from the west through sections thirty and twenty-nine, as well as twenty-eight, and then tortuously into twenty seven, turns south through thirty-four, and finally empties into a slough in the eastern part of sec tion thirty-five. North and south of this depres sion, which has several branches on each side, there may be said to be table lands, of greater or less widths. CHAPTER LVII. GENERAL DESCRIPTION EARLY SETTLEMENT FIRST BIRTH DEATH MARRIAGE ORGANIZATION \u2014 JEFFERSON VILLAGE RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS A REMINISCENCE BIOGRAPHICAL. This town occupies the .southeast corner of Houston county, and of the state of Minnesota. The eastern boundary is the Mississippi River. The northern tier of sections in the original govern ment survey is taken to help make Crooked Creek township, but the loss of these is compen sated for by the addition of several sections on the east from the adjoining township, the bulk of which fads on the Wisconsin side of the river, and so this town, in area, does not differ very widely from an original government township. The town is rather noted for its springs, which appear on the points of the bluffs near the river. The sod is a rich loam along the valley, which is comparatively narrow. The bluffs rise several hundred feet, but there are some good, but smad farms on these ridges. Some of the bottom lands near the river, where not timbered, furnish peren nial crops of hay of a wild or meadow variety. The topography of the town, in the eastern por tion is characteristic of the western bank of the Mis sissippi in this region. For two or three mdes from the river bank, there are numerous sloughs, the intervening land being hardly land at ad, but a 27"], [432, "418 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. Near the Catholic Church in section twenty-eight, is a fine large spring, which, in earlier days, was so much larger than now, that a bargain was almost closed with Mr. P. Donahue, the owner, for a mill site, as it was thought at that time to furnish suf ficient water to run a factory, which was in con templation. In the year 1847, John Ross, a native of Penn sylvania, who had been in the Mexican war, came up the river from Galena, Illinois, and built a log cabin. His brother Samuel also came, and they had two places, one of them was left in Minne sota and the other in Iowa by the government surveyors. The varieties of soil are not unlike other parts of the county near the river. There is timber and prairie, ravine and ridge land, giving to the scenery a picturesqueness which is ever changing as one travels from place to place. The town is tolerably wed settled, but there are still, according to the plats, quite a number of government forties with other larger tracts still in the market. The place was then known as Ross's landing and was so designated on the maps published at that period. Some of the Winnebago Indians who were on this side of the river assisted in rolling the logs to build the cabins. It seems that Samuel Ross bought the place, and they lived there six or seven years, when he sold to John, who did not keep it long but transferred it to an Illinois man, who never settled on it, and the property is still occupied by renters. John Ross engaged quite extensively in lumbering, running his timber to Galena and other points below. He made other claims at various points, but did not consider them worth holding, and so they were abandoned. In surveying the State line between Iowa and Minnesota, west from the Mississippi, no suitable place could be found to plant the iron monument, prepared to mark the boundary, until reaching about three miles from the river, when it was placed on the line in the center of section thir ty-five. It is supposed that the oldest living settler in town now is Patrick Collins, who settled here in May, 1854, and resides on section thirty. John Cauley and family came the same year; he has since died. Thomas Brady and Patrick Donahue came about the same time, and also Patrick Mc- Cue, D. Friney, and Daniel Kennedy. The Iron Post. \u2014 The line post above mention ed is on the first high ground west of the river. It is an obelisk of cast-iron, a half-inch thick, and five feet eight inches above ground; it is twelve inches square at the base and tapers to seven at the top. The lettering and figures are cast up on the monument. On the north side in a vertical line, as they are on each side, is the word, Minne sota, on the south, Iowa, on the west, Lat. 43 degrees 30 minutes, on the east, 1849. It was brought up the Mississippi by a surveying party, landed at the nearest point and hauled with oxen with great difficulty to the spot. This was several years after the date on the monument. Michael Crowley came from Louisville, Ken tucky, where he had lived five years. He died a few years afterwards, and Mrs. Crowley died No vember 14th, 1880. Michael S. Brady came here in May, 1856, from Chicago, where he had been for eighteen months. He came originally from County Cavan, Ireland, in 1847. He had been some time in Ohio and in Pennsylvania, where, in the year 1855, he had married Miss Margaret Sheridan, who died about six years after. In March, 1862, he again was married to Miss Mary Lamb. They had eight children, five of whom are living. The Chicago, Clinton, Dubuque, and Minneso ta railroad skirts the inner sloughs up and down the river, which for about two miles opposite the town is nearly a mde wide, but in section twenty nine is narrowed up to less than eighty rods. EARLIEST SETTLEMENT. The First Births. \u2014 The first remembered births in the township were Michael and Patrick, twin sons of Patrick Donahue, who are both living at the present time, one here and the other in Da kota. This was in July, 1856. The township of Jefferson was, unquestionably, the first point settled in Houston county, although Brownsville has often been accorded that honor, and it is true that not until the Browns located there, did the county attract particular at tention, although the early settlers who first loca ted in Wilmington, Winnebago, and Caledonia, did not know of the Browns at ad, until after making their claims. Early Deaths. \u2014 One of the first casualties was the case of James Malon, who started to go to Brownsville in December, 1855, and perished in the snow. He was living with his sister, Mrs. Hughes, and went to do some trading, and taking"], [433, "JEFFERSON TOWNSHIP. 419 the wrong track got lost in a severe snow storm, and his remains were not discovered until the follow ing spring. He was at first buried in town, but afterwards taken up and re-buried in or near Brownsville. His sister, above alluded to, died quite suddenly while on a visit to friends in Wis consin, and her remains were brought here and buried in the Catholic cemetery. Her son, John, stid lives here on the old place in section twenty seven. These people were early settlers. were elected Justices of the Peace, Patrick Don ahue was put in as Road Master. It seems that there were hardly men enough to go around, so the offices were thus doubled up. Everything seems to have gone on smoothly for the initial year, as everything was serene when the political year 1859 dawned upon the scene. The new election took place and Mr. Robert Kenny was returned as Chairman of the board, and on the last day allowed by law, presented his bond, with John Ross as surety, and then the trouble began. It seems that the Clerk had other views, and induced the other supervisors to name a rela tive of his for the alleged vacancy. Mr. Kenny was not the man to remain quiet and allow him self to be thus technically slaughtered, so the matter was referred to the District Court, Judge Donaldson being on the bench at the time. Mr. Kenny employed Hon. Daniel Norton, State Sena tor, as counsel. The result of the affair was that the clerk was required to accept the bond as ten dered, and Mr. Kenny was declared the lawfully constituted Chairman of Supervisors. The First Marriage, of which there is any ac count given, was not until 1859, when Mr. Den nis Brady and Miss Ann McCue were thus united, and they still reside here. The First Market the settlers had was in Wis consin, at a place called Victory, which was reached by crossing the river in skiffs, or they could go to Browsville, or down to Lansing, either place be ing about fifteen miles. The First Death. \u2014 It is evident that the first death in town was a case of accidental drowning in September, 1854. It seems that Patrick Crow ley, a young man, son of Michael, while taking some oxen to water, was by them crowded over a high bluff, and although he was soon taken from the water where he had lodged against some brush, all efforts at resuscitation proved unavail ing. JEFFERSON VILLAGE This place was formerly called Ross's Landing, from John Ross, whose family still live in New Albin, across the line in Iowa, and who died a few years ago. He was the nearest resident for quite a while, and in Winnebago may stdl be seen an old guideboard pointing to Ross's Landing. An Incident. \u2014 Soon after Ross came, a man named Smith located a claim near him, but he soon sold to a Norwegian who brought his wife. Not long after the man died suddenly, and four days later they were found, with his wife too sick to get up from his side. After the man was hur ried, Ross carried the woman to Lansing, where she was lost sight of. In the fall of 1868, Anton Eck located about three- fourths of a mile north of the State line, on a slough, and started a hotel ; he still resides there. The next to put in an appearance was James Cal lihan, who also opened and kept a hotel. In the fall of the next year, 1869, Lewis Hayes located here and built a large budding, the lower story arranged for a store and the upper one for a dwed ing. The store is now empty, but Mr. Hayes stdl lives here. The two Rosses took the body, rolled it in a sheet, placed it in a box, and in a grave under an oak tree near the spring, not far from the cabin, and the oak still stands as a sentry over his last resting place. The land where the village was laid out was bought of Mr. Wm. Robinson by Wm. and R. P. Spencer, and surveyed and recorded as a village plat. When the railroad was building there was a disagreement as to damages, and the case went to the supreme court. The railroad company finally run their line by the water's edge. ORGANIZATION. The township organization was effected in 1858. The first election was held at the resi dence of Patrick Donahue. The board of super visors elected were: Robert Keuny, Chair man, John Ross and Patrick Donahue. Alex. Durkee was chosen Clerk, with John Ross, assist ant and also Treasurer; Alex. Durkee was made Constable; Robert Kenny and Michael S. Brady Wm. Robinson built a warehouse for storing grain, and was for several years in that trade. That same fad Mr. Hayes rented his store to John"], [434, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 420 Robinson and Mr. Tartt, who opened it and con tinued in trade for several years. After that Mr. James Bisset took the store and run it about a year, when, closing out, that wound up merchan dising here. that it had a vigorous infancy, and was nursed with fond care, but ere long, the diseases of in fancy peculiar to some unfortunate western cities threatened its life. Its friends from the country occasionady come down and a boat on the river timidly ventures up to the bank. What is to be the result no one can predict. It may be that new life will be infused into the arteries of its trade, and that its vigor wid return, and health and prosperity wid restore it to usefulness. Let us hope so, and be ready to welcome it back to the busy world. Mr. Wm. Robinson, in the course of two years or so, sold out his business and rented his warehouse to different parties. He died a few years after wards, at his residence on Portland prairie, Iowa, having just disposed of his remaining interest to the railroad company, a half still belonging to R. P. Spencer, of Lansing Iowa. The present ownership of the warehouse is vested in the Railroad company and Mr. Harvey Randall of New Albin. RELIGIOUS. Roman Catholic \u2014 The first mass known to have been celebrated in Jefferson, was at the house of Daniel Kenny, on section seventeen, in 1854 or '55 by Father Pendergast, who had six appoint ments on his circuit, and officiated once in two months at each, spending the most of his time in Winona, where he resided. He was relieved by Rev. Father Essing, of Brownsville, who began about 1859, and held monthly meetings quite reg ularly at the house of Michael S. Brady foj- several years, or up to about 1868, when the Rev. Father Mathew succeeded him, and taking hold of the work in earnest, he soon organized a church, and in the spring commenced the erection of the present edifice, which was in due time completed. Services since the occupancy of the church have been monthly or semi-monthly. The present pastor is the Rev. Father Wm. Brennan, of Brownsville, who started with about twenty-five families and now numbers forty or fifty. The church is a neat frame structure, 30x40 feet, with a ten foot addi tion for the chancel. There is a spire and belfry, but as yet, no bed. The first interment in the church yard was Michael, son of M. C. Brady, twelve years of age. The location of the church is on an elevation north of the Caledonia and New Albin road, on the northeastern part of section twenty-eight, about four miles from New Albin. Another early settler was Isaac D. Smith, the father of Mrs. Hayes, who arrived in the fall of 1869. He was a native of the state of New York, as were his children; he had been living seven or eight years in Lansing; his widow still lives here, as well as a daughter. Mr. Hayes originated in Vermont and came west to Lansing in 1852. His wife was Miss Sophia Smith, who had been living in Baraboo, Wisconsin. The railroad came through in 1873, but there never was a station here, and it is idle to speculate now as to what might have been had there been no contest with the company. But what did happen was this, the radroad company bought some land just south of the State line, and started a village called New Albin, which had a rapid growth for a few years, absorbing what of lde had been infused into Jefferson, so that it ex pired without a struggle. There is a water tank to mark whe re it stood, and the trains whistle re morselessly by, regardless of the hopes that lie buried here. The few residents who live at the village, as it is stdl called, are engaged in fishing in the sloughs making up to this point. They cultivate small gardens at the base of the bluffs, but the principal industry is the gathering of fish, using for the purpose immense seines, with which they take at one haul sometimes 50,000 pounds, and one of the fish stories they insist upon being true is that about Christmas, 1879, they made one haul which secured nearly 100,000 pounds. The principal variety of fish thus landed are sheeps head, or white bass, buffalo, pickerel, pike, and often enor mous catfish, weighing forty or fifty pounds each. SCHOOLS. District No. 48. \u2014 This district was organized about 1860, when a summer term was taught by Miss Mary Donahue at the residence of John Cauley. Afterwards a school was taught in Mr. Collins' claim shanty. In 1864, a schoolhouse was constructed, and the fodowing year Miss B. Gertrude Hacket, of Dubuque, taught the first term in the new house, which was the first one As to New Albin it is not disrespectful to say"], [435, "JEFFERSON TOWNSHIP. 421 erected in the district, and was of moderate size, but is still in use. in Kilmoganny, Kilkenny county, Ireland. He came with his parents, Daniel and Mary Kenny, to America when ten years old, and in the spring of 1854, with his brother Thomas, came to Town one hundred and one north, range four west, afterward called Jefferson township, his parents joining him in 1856. In May, 1861, he was united in mar riage with Mrs. Elizabeth Kirby, widow of the late Mr. Kirby, who had long been a resident of Bankston settlement, Dubuque county, Iowa. Mr. Kenny's father died in July, 1868, and his mother in October, 1873. The subject of this sketch re sided in various places until 1872, when he was among the first to build a house in New Albin, Al lamakee county, Iowa. In the early days of Houston county he was quite conspicuous in local podtics, but of late bis time and talents have been devoted to his business. He is a man of more than ordinary business ability, and has been quite suc cessful in life. Mrs. Kenny died in Aprd, 1879, and was buried in the Jefferson Cathode ceme tery. Two children were bom to them, Mary, who now keeps house for her father, and Ella, now at tending school. District No. 44. \u2014 This had been in a district connected with a southern part of Crooked Creek, and was organized in 1876. The earliest teacher was Miss Theresa Manix, of Caledonia, the second was Miss B. Gertrude Hacket. Miss Anna Kelli ker has previously taught in the house of P. Mc- Cauley on the Crooked Creek side of the hne. District No. 82. \u2014 This is located in section thirty-five, in the old village, and was organized in 1870, and in the winter of 1870-71, Miss Ella Haines, of Dorchester, Iowa, taught school. It has from six to seven months school each year. District No. 27. \u2014 This district was organized in 1863. The first teacher was Anna Johnson, who taught in the summer of 1864. The school has little uniformity as to length of school terms, but it usually is from three to four months each year. The schoolhouse is of logs, and was budt about the time the first district was organized. A Reminiscence. \u2014 The conventionalities of official correspondence are sometimes cut across by innovations, which relieve the monotony of traditional forms. Here is an instance where straggling genius was not repressed by any fear of departing from the regular forms in such case made and provided. It was 'received, and due notice taken, by E. W. Trask, the County Auditor at the time : Peter McDonald, another early settler in this town, is a native of Canada, and came to this State with his brother, Ensign, on the 18th of October, 1855. For a number of years they had resided in New York, returning to thed home just before com ing west. Mr. McDonald was joined in matrimony with Miss Catherine McMullen, the ceremony tak ing place in Waterbury, New York, in July, 1852. Mr. McDonald and his brother came west to Chi cago, thence to Victory, and crossed in a skiff to this place, landing about midnight in October, 1855. The next morning Peter selected a claim in section seven, Ensign having been here the season before and taken land in section twenty-eight. Mr. McDonald brought his famdy here the fodowing spring, and has since moved to section thirty four, where he now lives. He enlisted in Com pany C, of the Second Minnesota Volunteer Infan try, the 27th of May, 1864, and served tid the close of the war. Of six chddren born to him, three are living. \"Notice is hereby given, that Jefferson John, On the 9th day of March, thereabout or thereon, Was duly elected to an office of trust, And by law is equipped, to rake in the dust, That is coming or due to Jefferson Town, From a five hundred note to a dollar bill down.

CHAPTER LVIII. DESCRIPTIVE EARLY SETTLEMENT INTERESTING EVENTS TOWN ORGANIZATION VILLAGE LA CRESCENT TOWN SITE COMPANY\u2014 MANUFACTURING SCHOOLS CHURCHES \u2014 BIOGRAPHICAL. EARLY SETTLEMENT. Undoubtedly the first man of European extrac tion to set his foot on the sod of La Crescent with a view of creating a home, was Peter Cameron, a native of Deerfield, Oneida county, New York. He was the eldest son of Daniel Cameron, and was reared upon a farm, but became restive under the uneventful restraints of such a quiet life, and at an early age moved westward, buying furs through Michigan and Indiana, and finally to where Chicago now is. From that point he sent out four-horse teamp to gather in the peltries from the Indians and trappers in Illinois and Wiscon sin, and finally his base of operations became the Mississippi. He continued making trips by land and water between Galena and Fort Snelling. After a time he concluded to take a claim on the site of St. Paul, but finding himself anticipated, came down the river to La Crosse, and in 1842, built a claim shanty, and entered into trade doing some lumbering business and making improve ments. In the spring of 1851, Mr. Cameron came across the river and erected a commodious double log house on section ten, near a fine large spring. A part of tha house still remains. At the same time he located 240 acres of land, which became the east half of the southwest and the west half of the southeast of section ten, and eighty acres south of the above, and also 300 acres in sections thirteen, fourteen, and twenty-four along the Mississippi River. He began improvements and did what he could to build up a village, encouraging people to locate here. In 1855, business interests took him to La Crosse again, where, while engaged in build ing a saw-mill, he died on the 30th of July, 1855. and there his remains were buried. This is the first river town in the county coming down the Mississippi, is the northeast township of Houston county, and embraces about twenty seven sections. Winona county is on the north, the Mississippi on the east, Hokah on the south, and Mound Prairie on the west. The thriving city of La Crosse is over the river opposite, in Wisconsin. It is the terminus of the Southern Minnesota railroad which comes from the west, and is the junction of two other divisions of the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul railroad. PHYSICAL FEATURES. From the Mississippi River the bottom lands ex tend well back into the township. In the south east corner is Target Lake, a body of water three fourths of a mile long and half as wide, into which Pine Creek empties. This stream runs diagonally through the township from the north western corner, and lays in a characteristic valley. In the north part of the town the bluffs come quite near together. The best farming land is in the valleys, which are exceptionally healthful. The southwestern part of the town includes a high ridge extending from the Pine Creek vadey to that of the Root River, but with ravines penetrat ing it at various points. At first it was supposed that the ridges would never be settled, but the German immigrants com menced locating there, and the strong clay soil has proved valuable. Pine Creek is fed almost exclusively by springs from every hillside. As to timber, there is yet"], [437, "LA CRESCENT TOWNSHIP. 423 His wife was a remarkable beauty who flourished at that time, and is better known as Mrs. Van Sickles. arrival Martin Cody, from the Emerald Isle, staked out his claim on section eight, and here he lived and wrought for several years, but finally made the village his home, where he now lives, one of the oldest men in town. Mr. M. Farrell now occupies this farm. After this the valley rapidly filled up, and many of the early settlers still oc cupy their original farms. Part of Mr. Cameron's original claim was what was afterwards laid out as a vdlage, and it was his evident intention to return and found a city on this western bank of the Father of Waters. Thor Halverson, a Norwegian, was the next man to ap pear, and he constructed a residence of a primi tive character, on the southeast of section three. This was in 1852. He made few improvements, did some wood chopping, but worked away from home most of the time. He remained here untd 1881, selling the land as he could from time to time, a part of it being in the village. The Gil letts were the next comers but they will be alluded to in the village sketch. Cameron's Canal.\u2014 No one can predict what might have happened if Cameron had hved. His projects and conceptions were on a vast scale. Remembering that rival cities on the mighty Mis sissippi, those on the western bank usually carry off the palm for superiority, he proposed to meas ure swords with the young contestant for the championship over in Wisconsin, and as a practi cal measure began the construction of a canal from the river to the high land available for a town site. The canal began at the river in the lower part of section thirteen, and terminated near the center of section fourteen, at a point in Pine Creek where a fragmentary lake or slough makes well up to the first bench. The lake is quite shoal in places, but the bottom is far from being compact, and it was thought the action of the steamers in passing through would secure and preserve a good depth. This canal was started in 1854, but Mr. Cameron had so many interests that it was not pushed very vigorously, although it was completed as above stated. This same year, 1852, a settlement was started on Pine Creek near the northwestern part of the town, the immigrants fodowing up that stream, and it was known as the \"Pine Creek Settlement.\" Samuel Hooper was one of the pioneers here, and of his origin or history nothing is known, ex cept that he came and built a cabin with one-half in this and the other half in Winona county, and that he worked there until 1854, when he departed, and Mr. P. Ferguson now owns the place. In October, 1852, Widiam Meyers, a German, established a claim on section six and rolled up some logs for a shelter, but sold out the next year, and took another farm further north on the same section, where he remained until summoned to that \"bourne from which no traveler returns,\" in 1873. A steamboat was also built in La Crosse, 150 feet in length, and launched, but on account of the death of the proprietor it did not receive the machinery, and the whole enterprise was aban doned. In the early summer of 1852, Mr. F. Duren lo cated on the same section, constructed a residence in the prevailing style and began to break up land, but in 1855, he left, and Mr. M. F. Welch now cultivates the farm. It is said that Duren went over into Winona county, thence to Chicago, and finally to Germany, to avoid the terrible draft during the war. INTERESTING EVENTS. An early, if not the first birth, was a lively lit tle daughter of Henry and Margaret Anna Wet gen, who was born in October, 1853, on section six, and who received the christian name of Chris tiana. She is now Mrs. G. Baden, of Hokah. In the same summer, 1852, Henry Wetgen opened a farm on the east half of the northwest of section six, and improved and worked it until his removal from earth in 1871. His wife and two children remain to till the farm and keep up the home he provided. They must be the oldest liv ing settlers in town. Another uncertain point is as to the first death, but it is supposed to have been that of Catharine, a two year old daughter of Mr. Detrich Day, in the fall of 1854. Her remains were at first depos ited on the farm, but afterwards removed to the cemetery. The First Store. \u2014 In the spring of 1854, Peter Cameron and D. Richardson put a stock of goods in the old house of Cameron, which is yet stand ing near the radroad track. There were severa On the 29th of July, 1853, Johannes Tuininga, a Hollander, located on the southwest of section six, and he is still there.

BOUNTIES. At a town meeting at the Minnesota House, held on the 30th of March, 1864, the fodowing resolution was presented by G. F. Potter: An Incident. \u2014 At an early day, when physi cians were a luxury on this side of the river, and not readily obtainable by the new colonists, the wife of Mr. J. Tuininga was bitten by a rattlesnake, but, as he had no money, he consequently supposed it impossible to procure a doctor, and so he pro ceeded to do the best he could. He had, with a ton and a half of hay, bought four fowls, which had raised twenty -four chickens, and, in obedience to some tradition, he began to kdl the chickens one by one, and laying them open, applied them to the bitten part. This was kept up until the last bird had made a blood warm poultice for the suf fering woman, and still one side was swelling and there was no adeviation of the symptoms. The family were in despair when a stranger was seen coming up the road. The sorrowful story was soon told to him, with the anxious inquiry as to whether he was not a doctor ? and explained that he had no money to pay one. The gentlemen told him that he was not a physician, but handed him $10 and told him to go fora doctor at once, which he lost no time in doing, and the woman recovered. The stranger was pressed for his name and gave it as H. M. Rice, of St. Paul. Mr. Tuininga never forgot this act of kindness, and years afterwards he saw this name on a ticket at the polls for Gov ernor, and he voted the straight ticket of that party the only time in his life. \"Resolved: That the Supervisors and the Town Clerk of La Crescent be, and they are hereby in structed and required to issue township orders to the amount of $200 for each volunteer who shall be duly accredited to the township of La Crescent, to and for a sufficient number of volunteers to fid the quota of said town, on the present and all fu ture calls that may be made by the President of the United States for volunteers.\" On the motion being put it was declared carried, with fifty-nine in the affirmative and one in the negative. On motion of George F. Potter, it was unani mously resolved that a special tax be levied to meet the obligations just incurred. Another special meeting of the board was called on the 20th of February, 1865, to confirm the ac tion already taken, as a question had arisen as to whether the bounty would apply to subsequent calls. It was resolved to continue the bounty. THE PRESENT TOWN OFFICERS. Supervisors, A. H. Brayton, Chairman, Louis Lilly, and Aug. Rodke; Assessor, E. A. Wheeler; Clerk, P.

On the 11th of May, 1858, the first town meet ing was held to perfect the organization. On motion of J. A. Anderson, O. T. Gdman was called to the chair as temporary Chairman, and A. H. Brayton moved that J. C. Pennington be the Mod erator, which prevailed. On motion of G. F. Pot ter, O. T. Gdman was appointed Clerk. The natural advantages of the location of this village are most admirable. The usual high bluffs near the river, leave it here, just north of the vidage, to run back into a sweeping curve, to again appear a mile or so below, and thus forming a crescentic basin or plateau, with a chain of hills on the convex side. At the foot of the bluff north and west of the village, there is a strip of table land, or the second bench, and below this is the first bench or plateau, and stretching away to the main channel of the Mississippi a mile distant, is the river bottom land. At 10 o'clock the pods were opened and, with the exception of an hour at noon, kept open till 5 o'clock, with the following result: Supervisors, D. Cameron, Chairman, S. Day and P. S. Taft; Clerk, M. W. Wdcox; Assessor, Wm. R. Mercer; Collector, C. F. Adams; Justices of the Peace, Geo. F. Potter and J. Stewart; Con stables, S. K. Clow and John Anderson; Overseer of the Poor, Thomas Minshall ; Road Overseers, D. This very spot must have been the site of a vd lage of people that preceeded the Indians, who were not nomadic ; as the redes they have left in the form of mounds, conclusively show that they"], [439, "LA CRESCENT TOWNSHIP. 425 had lived generation after generation on one spot, and the accumulation of ashes, husks, shells, bones and other material, insensibily built these mounds. As a confirmation of the correctness of this theory, it is stated that in Asia, every city of the plain, which was evidently started on a level with the surrounding country thousands of years ago, is now on a mound, and some of them with the ruins of three tiers of buildings, one above another. The indestructible material constantly coming into the city from the country to suppply the wants of the people, having created this vast accumulation. got out logs and cordwood, and afterwards broke up some land. The place was called Manton, and this part of the vdlage stdl bears the name on the records. They commenced selling lots from the first, as the prospect of having a large city grow up here, seemed most favorable. In the fall of that year, 1855, Col. Wm. R. Mercer, of La Crosse, came over and erected a hotel on the site of the La Crescent Hotel, which is on the crest of the bench on Mississippi Avenue. This was run by him for about two years. Soon after the Colonel came, John A. Anderson, from Springfield, Ohio, erected a budding and put in a stock of general merchandise. The old building still stands, next to the store of Ferguson's, on the east side. Charles Sperry opened a blacksmith shop the same year. Up to the spring of 1856, the Gdletts did good business in disposing of house lots at a good round figure, and when they finally sold out, they were in good circumstances. They moved to La Crosse aud thence to Hastings, where they still live. Here,at La Crescent, was a chain of these mounds near the slope of the second table which have not yet been obliterated. Fragments of pottery are found here in great abundance. In the railroad excavations large amounts of clay pottery, that which had been moulded and burned, were thrown out. The village, as it was originally surveyed, plat ted, spread on parchment, and recorded, covers 280 acres on section eleven, about forty acres on section three, and all of section ten except about 120 acres. In this much laid out space can be found, water lots, always submerged, marshy ground frequently underwater, bluff land with its jagged decdvities, and the table land on the sec ond elevation, where the buildings are actually located. Some of this is covered with a fine growth of scattering oak and other trees. THE LA CRESCENT TOWN SITE COMPANY. This company, which bought the property of the Gdletts, and afterwards operated the ferry to La Crosse, was usuady known as the \"Kentucky Company.\" Its history is briefly as follows: In the spring of 1856, Jared Boyle, J. M. Bryant, Charles S. Waller, Thomas McRoberts, and E. Ran dolph Smith, formed themselves into a company and purchased of Mrs. Mary Gdlett 160 acres, with the exception of the lots already sold and a few reserved, and also the north half of section eleven running to the river, paying for the whole, as was reported, between $25,000 and $35,000. Very soon a stock company was organized and large numbers of shares sold, at a handsome profit on the original investment. The whole of this tract was put into lots, and on the market, and although the company did not sed comer lots, re serving them for a rise, they made a corner on ev ery lot, those under water as wed as those setting up edgewise along the bluff. The stock rapidly rose and became very popular, particularly in Ken tucky where the leading statesmen, generals, pro fessional men, editors, and business men eagerly The first man to locate on this spot was Peter Cameron, who has been already mentioned, and who erected a comfortable log house here in the spring of 1851. The first steps taken toward the location and actual platting of a vidage here was by the Gidett Brothers, Harvey and William, who had taken the northeast quarter of section ten. The Gdlett family consisted of these two young men and two still younger brothers, and a sister, with their mother who was a widow. They had come to La Crosse from Ohio, and having caught ths small pox and in some way lost their money, they found themselves in the pest house entirely destitute; but Peter Cameron became interested in the case, and through his infiuence they came over and took this claim. The young men were unmar ried and the claim was entered in the mother's name. The first plat was about forty acres on the south west of the northeast of section ten. They pro cured some oxen, and during the following winter secured shares. Stock in this company is to-day held in almost every State from the Atlantic to California. Among some of the noted men who were known to have stock in this affair were: George D. Pren-"], [440, "426 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. tiss, of the Louisville Courier; Wdl Bross, of the Chicago Tribune; General Breckinridge; Geo. B. McGoffin, war Governor of Kentucky; Henry Walter, Chicago; John G. Allen, St. Louis; Col. A. G. Hodges, Louisvide, Kentucky ; A. H. Bow man, Lexington, Kentucky; G. A. Rockwell, and many others in different parts of the country. So that the company, although it failed to build a city, nevertheless sold the lots at a handsome profit. boat, upon which it largely depended to coin money, and the prices were put up to the utmost limit of public endurance. No effort was made to have the steamboats on the river land here, as the company desired to secure the transfer across the river under an exacting toll. Few men who desired to locate for business, could afford the prices asked for building lots. The panic of the autumn of 1857 was depressingly felt here, but there was quite a prompt recovery, and in 1858 and 1859, when the Southern Minnesota railroad was grading, La Crescent was on the top wave of its prosperity. Professional men, newspaper men, business men, and working men were flocking hither like pil grims to the stardard of Richard Couer de Lion, but Hokah, Houston and the other towns to the west, with La Crosse, had conspired to leave it stranded a mile from the river where it was origi nally planted, and two miles from the radroad ter minus, where trans-shipments were made across the river to La Crosse. THE NAME. This was a matter of considerable anxiety and of quite as much importance. The momentous ques tion was settled at the regular meeting of the pro prietors at the Tremont House in La Crosse, soon after the purchase was made. The original name, Manton, was proposed and rejected, as not being sufficiently high toned. As a feeble rival to their proposed city they saw La Crosse over the river, and presumed on an easy conquest for the su premacy, and remembering the form of the bids around the new town, and also recalling the an cient contests of the Crusaders against the Sara cens and Turks in their efforts to recapture the Holy Sepulchre, where the Cross and the Crescent were raised aloft in deadly strife, and being mind ful of the fate that overtook those who struggled under the banner of La Crosse, they resolved to challenge their rival by raising the standard of La Crescent, and thus fight it out on that line. By the terms of the charter, the railroad was to have one terminus in La Crescent, but as no particular point was specified, the Kentucky com pany was thus left to gnash its teeth with impo tent rage. And thus it was that this precocious city has not yet fulfilled the promises of its early founders, or met the expectations of its confiding stockholders. ADDITIONS. There have been quite a number of additions to the town site, and some of them have not been re corded. THE PROGRESS OF THE VILLAGE. In June, 1856, the company put up an office as headquarters for the business, and in 1857, a double and single store was erected and twelve dweding houses. Thomas McRoberts was the agent of the company, and sold many lots to anxious buyers, but such was his confidence in the growth of the city that no corner lots were sold, and others real ized from $250 to $600 each. Such was the char acter of the fever that raged at that time, that for a corner lot where the Post-office now stands, and which was owned by an outsider, was offered 81, 100 in gold, which was refused. Bryant & Watt's addition was platted in 1876 or '57, and must have been a purely speculating scheme, as it was on the marsh and lake, and some of it under water to the depth of six feet, the lots and blocks were sold, and the title deeds are still in the hands of the parties who, if they have ever cut their wisdom teeth, have done it since the pur chase of the property. Cameron's addition was laid out in 1857, it is on the second level, and although a desirable location, but four lots were ever disposed of. The company was short-sighted and illiberal in its policy, and whde there were clearly elements of success in the enterprise, an opposition on both sides of the river was needlessly provoked, and the whole scheme proved a dismal failure. Wdliam's addition was put in the market in 1857, but the most of it is now an improved farm. Moore & Peterson's addition was put out into the cold world about the same time, and was on the hills and side of the bluff. A few of the causes leading to the final collapse will be alluded to. The company put on a ferry Martindale's addition was another extension to"], [441, "LA CRESCENT TOWNSHIP. 427 the prospective city, and there may have been still others. the county could endure any number of duplica tions of this enterprise. THE WAR RECORD. An Early Flouring Mill. \u2014 In 1860, Mr. C. J. Laugenbach put up a mill with two run of stones near where the woolen mid now is. It did good work untd the fall of 1864, when it fed a vic tim to the devouring element, and the woolen mid occupied the power. La Crescent, like her sister towns, was alive to the importance of responding to the cad for so many hundred thousand more by Mr. Lincoln. And in 1863, an organization was effected called the \"La Crescent Redes Club,\" to secure funds to pay enlisted men, that there might be no necessity for the dreaded draft. That the success was com plete is shown by the books now in the hands of Mr. P. Ferguson, which indicate that the sum of $4,800 was raised and paid out in bounties at the rate of $200 each to enlisted men. The amount, however, was returned by the township, so as to make an equitable burden upon the property holders. Saw-Mill. \u2014 One of the earher enterprises of the township was the erection of a saw-mill, which was commenced in 1856, by Gross & Co. Its loca tion was on Pine Creek, in the extreme northwest ern part of the town, on section three. A dam was thrown across the stream to secure power. The mill was 18x44 feet and two stories high, with a vertical saw propelled by a turbine wheel, and was completed and put in operation on the 13th of May, 1857 ; it developed a capacity of 1,000 feet of lumber a day. It was kept in operation more or less regularly up to about 1872, when it was sold to T. Casper; the building itself went to Hokah township, and the machinery beyond St. Cloud. The power is now used by Gross & Co. to drive thed flouring mid. POST-OFFIOE, The Post-office was established in the winter or spring of 1856, with Mr. Harvey Gdlett as Post master, and was at first located in the store of John A. Anderson. The first quarter, the total re ceipts of the office were sixty-five cents, which were duly forwarded to the department. Mr. Thomas Minshall was soon appointed Postmaster, and the office went to another store in the western part of the village. Mr. Minshall has held the key to the mail pouch ever since. Linganore Flouring Mill. \u2014 This is situated not far from the old saw-mill. When first built, in 1859, it was 30x40 feet with an attic above the sec ond story. It had at first a single ran of stones turned by a reaction wheel made by the owners of the mill, Gross & Co. Since its erection it has from time to time received improvements. In 1873, an addition of 14x30 feet was made, and now the mill has three run of stones for wheat, and one for feed. A head of thirteen feet is available. The concern has cost about $6,000, and is good prop erty. MANUFACTURING. The Toledo Woolen Mills. \u2014 This prosperous and substantial establishment is located in the southeast quarter of section six, on Pine Creek. Its erection was commenced by Thomas Fletcher and J. & N. Webster in the spring of 1865. It is a fine stone structure, three stories high and a good basement, and was completed in the fad of that year. It has first-class machinery that cost about $8,000, consisting of one set of cards forty eight inches in width, six looms, a jack with 264 spindles, with shearing, fulling, and other ma chinery to finish good work. Special attention is given to the manufacture of yarn, fiannels, blankets, and kerseymeres. The power is from the creek, and is transmitted, under a fourteen feet head, by a turbine wheel. In 1878, Mr. M. Webster bought out Mr. Fletcher and his brother, and has since managed it alone. The local trade is sup plied in a retad way, and three men with teams are kept on the road to dispose of the goods man ufactured. It is a most valuable industry, and The Burton Saw-Mill. \u2014 This was constructed in 1857, on the southwest quarter of section six, by Mr. D. Burton, and was considered a good mdl in those days, as it had two sash saws and plenty of water from Pine Creek. It was kept in opera tion a few years, but it had periodical seasons of distress on account of too much water, and it was finally nearly destroyed. With a hope of better ing the condition of things, an attempt was made to locate the establishment about eighty rods down stream, but the reverses had so nearly broken up the proprietor that the project was abandoned. The Michael Saw-Mill. \u2014 Another mid was put up about this time by Samuel Michael on a branch of the creek in section one. It had a sin-"], [442, "428 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. gle saw set in motion by an avershot wheel. This mid also, in its struggles with the freshets, got roughly handled. It frequently changed hands, with the hope that new backers might bring it safely through in its unequal contests, but in 1866, it went down and was not again resurrected. in this lodge, and that there are now thirty-five members. The present officers are: W. R. Anderson, W. M.; Daniel Webster, S. W.; Alfred Purdy, J. W.; J. Tuininga, Sr., Treasurer; H. D. Gurley, Secre tary; J. J. Blue, S. D.; J. O. Hill, J. D.; Thomas Minshad, Tyler. La Crescent Flouring Mill. \u2014 This mill was built early in the seventies, by D. J. Cameron on his farm in section nine, on Pine Creek. It is a two story frame building and has four run of stones. A dam was constructed to secure a head of seven feet, but most unfortunately it was dis covered that, to sustain that amount, the water was backed up to the race of the Toledo mill, and after a legal contest it was decided that the dam must be lowered two feet. Since that time the mid has been idle. The first communications were in the Wader budding, and then they were held in a hall owned by J. A. Anderson. For many years past the lodge has occupied rooms in the old double store of the Town Site company, now owned by J. G. Allen. There have been other fraternal organizations of a reformatory character, but sic transit gloria mundi must be written on whatever monuments they have left, as a reminder that they were once here. PRESENT BUSINESS OF LA CRESCENT. SCHOOLS. There is one general store kept by P. Ferguson, and a smad stock of drugs, confectionery, and the like by the Pistmaster, Thomas Minshall. Two blacksmith and wagon shops, one shoe shop, and Mr. Sawyer keeps a hotel, and then there is the railroad station with its agent, express office, and telegraph. A select school was opened by Elder Spencer Carr, a Baptist minister, in 1857. A building was erected with a view of enlarging it if necessary. The higher branches were taught, and some pupils from abroad were secured, which, with others in town, made up the number to about eighteen. The school was not an overwhelming success, and it soon received a sine die vacation, when the gentle man put in a stock of drags in the same building. He afterwards went to Wisconsin and finady to Kansas, where he paid the debt of mortality. H the empty stores were filled the place would be like Paddy's toast to the \"Gadant 69th,\" \"Aqual to none.\" If there is any redemption for this deserted village, it must come from the intro duction of manufacturing. La Crescent Female Seminary. \u2014 This educa tional institute was opened in 1861, Mrs. Rice and Mrs. Anderson being the teachers, assisted by Edwin, a son of Mrs. Rice. They first occupied a building put up by Charles Waller, of Chicago, which has since been used as a storeroom, and there was an attendance of from twenty to thirty pupils, the old La Crescent Hotel being used as a boarding house. After the first year the whole establishment was removed to the Hotel, using the whole budding, and from thirty to forty boarders were secured, with several day scholars from the village. At the end of two years they removed to Rochester, and after awhile the family went to Cadfomia. FRATERNAL. Masonic. \u2014 In 1858, a petition duly signed was presented to the officers of the Grand Lodge, and on the 15th of November a dispensation was granted to Morning Star Lodge, No. 29. The fol lowing masons were the charter members and offi cers: E. H. Kennedy, W. M.; J. S. Pennington, S. W.; Elihu Hunt, J. W.; John A. Anderson, Treasurer; Charles H. Hudson, Secretary; M. W. Wdcox, S. D. ; Corydon Looney, J. D. ; W R. An derson, Tyler; and Henry T. Fox, and Joseph Fowler. The first mason made was Charles H. Hudson, who was appointed Secretary. He is now the gen eral manager of the Minneapods and St. Louis Railway. The books show that a grand total of ninety-eight members have District No. 1. \u2014 This is in the vidage. A school was held in the spring of 1356, in a budd ing now used by W. R. Anderson as a carpenter shop. It was erected by John A. Anderson as a territorial schoolhouse, and is a small frame affair. The first term was one of three months, and the presiding authority was Miss Nancy Ambler. \"Received its truthful teachings, Its principles of virtue, Its mystic traditions,\""], [443, "LA CRESCENT TOWNSHIP. 429 A, After working for about three months to get the keys of knowledge in their hands, the fever and ague came along and shook the school up so lively that it was, for the time, discontinued. There were but six or eight scholars all told. little frame church 20x40 feet, for the few Irish Catholics located on Pine Creek. It was on a lot back of a tavern kept by James Keen, near the place where the station house now is. Since that time the Catholic congregation continued to be attended occasionady, either from Hokah convent, Caledonia, Winona, or La Crosse. This was the condition of affairs when Rev. Father P. Pemin was called from Wisconsin to be the first resident priest of La Crescent. He at once removed the old church to a more central location, and enlarged it to meet the requirements of the increasing con gregation which now embraces seventy famdies. In 1857, a one-story brick house was laid up, 20x30 feet, and this served for educational pur poses up to 1868, when their present large stone building was constructed. It is of two stories, 26x42 feet, and cost abont $2,800. It has usually ten months of school each year, is divided into two departments with an attendance of about eighty. The house is furnished with modern ap pliances. Methodist. \u2014 This is a village society. The first meeting was held in a building that is now known as the Brown office, in June, 1856; this was before the structure was completed. The Rev. John Hooper was the officiating mis sionary. The next week a class was organized with Ralph Garrell as leader, and W. R. Anderson as steward. This point was associated with Hokah circuit, and services were kept up every two or three weeks at different places ; when the brick schoolhouse went up, that was occupied by this denomination. In 1867, the society was en abled to build a church 28x40 feet at a cost of $1,600. Services are now held on alternate Sun days by Rev. G. W. Barrett. The membership is about twenty-five. District No. 2. \u2014 The first school here was held in a log house rolled together for that pur pose, in section six, on the land of the present B. A. Jenkins estate, in 1855, and Miss Jane Burton wielded the ferule. This house served the district until 1864, when a frame house went up 16x24 feet, at a cost of $300, and was put on the land of J. Tuininga on section six. The infantile popula tion gathered in this house till the formation of District No. 84, when it was sold at auction, real izing fifteen dollars. A new house was built early in the seventies, on section eight, on the farm now owned by W. McArthur. District No. 84. \u2014 In 1870 or '71, this was set off from number two, and a frame house put up on section six soon after. Mr. M. Emery was the first teacher. There are now twenty -five pupils in attendance. German Methodist Episcopal. \u2014 This is an organization with a separate conference. The earliest religious service connected with this de nomination was at the log school house in section six, in the spring of 1858, by Rev. Mr. Feigen baum, a Presiding Elder from Galena, Idinois, as sisted by Rev. Charles Leibrandt. A class was promptly formed, a series of protracted meetings inaugurated, and the air was vocal witn revival melodies; the interest spread and deepened, a great revival ensued, and among the leading spirits in this work was Henry Knight. He was an earnest worker, his exhortations were affecting, his prayers fervent, and his piety unquestioned. He was a dealer in horses, and woidd leave town for a few weeks and return with some fine stock, when he would again turn his attention to evan gelical work, and gather in new converts. But one day an officer appeared with a requisition from the Governor of Illinois, and his saintship was tried and convicted in that State as a horse thief, and sent to state prison. And, although no District No 4. \u2014 A school was taught here in 1860 by Miss Abbie Taft in Groff & Co's mill for a single term. In 1861, a school was started in a small frame house just east of Gross's mid on sec tion three. Then it went into a log house, and finally their present building was put up at a cost of about $400. District No. 75. \u2014 This district was organized about 1870. The school was usuady held only during the winter. The first school was instructed by Miss Ella Richardson. The building is of hewn logs and a school is now taught in the summer. RELIGIOUS. Church of the Crucifixion, Roman Catholic. \u2014 The earliest mass in town was in a little log schoolhouse on section six, in 1856, by Father Tappard, of La Crosse. In 1858, Rev. Father Pendergast, who then resided in Winona, raised a"], [444, "430 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. one else was responsible for his hypocrisy, it was a severe set-back to the church. In 1861, the so ciety was resuscitated and new members were ad ded, the meetings were mostly held at the residence of C. J. Laugenbach, on section six', and in 1863, the church was built. It is 20x28 feet and entail ed a cost of $500. The supply is now from Hokah, Rev. F. W. Buckholz being the minister. Voorhes, J. E. Voorhes, and G. Voorhes. Miss Augusta Dorrence gave a silver communion service. The cost of the church was about $1,500. CEMETERIES. There are several of these necessary enclosures in the limits of the township, few of them, however, have yet received special care with a view to beautifying the grounds with tiowers, shrubs, and trees. Presbyterian. \u2014 A very early religious meeting was held on the first of June under an outspread ing oak, at the corner of Walnut and Wisconsin Streets, which, in the absence of any one to sing the song \"Woodman spare that tree,\" has since been cut down. Rev. S. G. Lowry held this ser vice, on Sunday, while on his way further west, as an emigrant. The Roman Catholic cemetery is one of the old est burial spots in town. The first mortal to be returned to mother earth here, was a Mr. Morris, who was frozen to death in 1856 or '57. His widow still lives in La Crosse. Long before the land was purchased it was the custom to bury those of this faith here, and now it is regularly set aside for that purpose, and for miles around, even from Winona county, they come on the melancholy errand of leaving the earthly remains of their departed ones here. The land was bought of Mr. Cody, and is a free burial place for those of the Catholic faith. Rev. D. L. Lyon visited the village in 1857, and talked about an organization, and the next year a meeting was called at the residence of W. H. Lapham, to perfect arrangements to form a so ciety, and such was the apparent success that $800 was subscribed to build a church, but, as it was not all available, no church was budt at that time. Toledo Cemetery. \u2014 This is situated near the Toledo Woolen Mill, on section six, a part on the Jenkins estate and a part on Mr. Webster's farm. The first person whose remains were returned, dust to dust, here, was Henry Wetgen, in 1877, an early settler in this part of the town. The fol lowing year the grounds were laid out, and it has since been used as a public burial place, the re ceipts of the lots going towards improvements. A score or so are already interred here. On the 31st of July, 1859, Rev. Sheldon Jack son occupied the brick schoolhouse for services; the following month he and and his estimable wife came here to reside, and on the 28th of December, 1859, the church was duly organized. The first members were: Daniel Cameron, Sr., Mrs. Janette Cameron, Mrs. A. J. Mercer, Mrs. Catharine B. Richardson, Dr. A. J. McCurdy, Mrs. Mary B. Jackson, and Mrs. Rozanna D. Burton. The first communion was on Sunday, in January, 1860. The first trustees were Col. Wm. R. Mercer, W. H. Lapham, and Edmund Evans. Thr Village Cemetery. \u2014 At first La Crescent's dead were buried on the farm of W. B. Potter, just north of the village, but in 1863, Wm. David son died and a new burial place was started on the northwest corner of the village plat. As others climbed the golden stair their remains were deposited in the same lot, and so, in 1873, ten years from the first use of the ground for this pur pose, it was regularly laid out and set aside as a place of sepulture. In 1880, an additional lot was added. It is owned by a company called The Prospect Hill Association. In July, 1861, the construction of the church was commenced, but was not completed until the next spring, and was dedicated on the 27th of April, 1862, Rev. James Frothingham and Rev. Wm. McNair assisting in the exercises. Mr. Jackson retired in the spring of 1864, and since his time the fodowing reverend gentlemen have been pastors. Mr. Parrott, S. Morton Pierce, J. H. Marr, J. H. Carpenter, Samuel H. Murphy, and James H. Marr and Mr. Carpenter were again here. At present there is no pastor. biographical. The bell to this church should not be forgotten, for it is claimed to be the first bell in a Presby terian church in Minnesota. The donors of the bell, which was hung up in the early winter of 1861, were Rev. J. H. Enders, P. Enders, J. H. William Reed Anderson, one of the pioneers and first officers of this place, was born in High land county, Ohio, on the 2d of July, 1827. When he was an infant his parents moved to Springfield in the same State, where William re-"], [445, "LA CRESCENT TOWNSHIP. 431 ceived his education. He also learned the carpen ter trade there and remained untd 1855, when he came to La Crescent. Mr. Anderson is a member of the Methodist church and Superintendent of tlie Sunday School. He was married to Miss Susan 0. Arnett in April, 1856, who has borne him two children. August, 1861, and served four years, not missing a fight in which the battery participated. After receiving his discharge he returned to this place, and was engaged in various pursuits. He was united in marriage with Miss Harriet L. Pidge of Hokah, the ceremony taking place on the 2d of December, 1867. Four children have blesssd this union, three of whom are living. Mr. Cameron was elected County Superintendent of schools in January, 1877, since which time he has held the office with much credit to himself and satisfaction to his constituency. A. H. Brayton is a native of Newport, Her kimer county, New York, born the 29th of Au gust, 1829. He attended the Whitestown Semina ry and the Albany State Normal school from 1850 until 1854, when he made a trip west. He soon returned home, however, and in 1856, came to Minnesota. The following year he purchased a farm in this place, and, with the exception of a number of visits to his native State, has since lived here, engaged in farming and stock-raising. Miss Elizaberh K. Orr became the wife of Mr. Brayton on the 19th of January, 1868. Seven children, five of whom are living, have been born to this union. Mr. Brayton is at present Chairman of the board of Supervisors and has held other local offices. J. C. Day is a native of Fayette county Penn sylvania, born on the 30th of January, 1822. His parents moved to Indiana county where J. C. was reared and attended school. In 1843, he left home, having in his possession but a few dollars; worked his way to Rock Island, Illinois, and thence to La Crosse, Wisconsin, where he was engaged in the pineries. In 1847, while on his way to Pittsburgh, he enlisted in the First Missouri Volunteer In fantry, Company E, serving till the close of the Mexican War. He then went to Pennsylvania, re maining until 1855, when be came to Minnesota and located a farm in what has since been known as Day's Valley, near Mound Prairie. In 1857, he came to this place, and with the exception of a few years, has since resided here. In 1859, he made an overland trip to Pike's Peak, and in 1864, made another to Virginia City, Montana. He filled several local offices here in an early day, was a member of the first State constitutional conven tion, and also of the first State Senate.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION \u2014 EARLY SETTLEMENT TOWN ORGANIZATION FIRST THINGS SCHOOLS BIOGRAPHICAL. This town is on the south of Union, west of Crooked Creek, north of Winnebago, and east of Caledonia, and is the southeast of the four central townships of the county. It is a government township with the exception of sec tions twenty-four, twenty-five and thirty-six, and one half each of sections twenty-three, twenty -six, and thirty-five, which help to make up Crooked Creek. The southwest part of the town is rolling and embraces a strip of prairie land, with some brush land, as it is caded, and some timber, particularly in section fourteen and the immediate vicinage. Nearly the entire northeast part is well timbered. The soil is of a clayey character, except in the prairie region where black loam prevails, Crooked Creek vadey extends up into this town, coming in at sections twenty-three and twenty six, and extending northwest to section eighteen, where the head of the vadey gets well elevated. Another depression comes up through section twenty-six, carrying a smad branch wldch makes its appearance in section twenty-nine. There is another httle stream rising in section nine, which finds its way into the creek in section sixteen. Away from these valleys the land is what may be called table land, but is denominated ridge land by the inhabitants, and supports many good farms. EARLY SETTLEMENT. Edward Buckley came to Minnesota in 1855, and settled in section nine, and two or three years afterwards removed across the line into Union, but soon afterwards returned to this town and settled on section four where he still remains. Mr. Cashman settled in section four about the same time. Martin Rohan located on section eight and afterwards on section five. Thomas Kennedy and his brother James came together, and estabhshed themselves on section five. This was, in the spring of 1855. There are no vdlages in the township, except Caledonia, which is mostly in the town of that name, but laps over into Mayville on sections eighteen and nineteen. The topographical char acteristics of the town are not unlike that of the others in the county. Thomas Moriarty came upon section eight in the spring of 1855, and afterwards went to Fid more county, where he recently died, Mr. Mc- Curdy, an old soldier, went on to section eleven, but after some years spent there he sold out. In the autumn of 1854, Jerry Hooley settled on sec tion nine, where he remained untd 1868, when he returned to Hlinois. In the northern part the ridges are broader than elsewhere. The eastern central portion is mostly made up of high, abrupt bluffs and narrow ra vines. The first settler in the northwest part of the town was Charles Klein with his wife, five daugh ters, and four sons. John Mann located on sec tion four. Gasper Molitor arrived here from Crooked Creek flows eastward through the cen tral part of the township, deflecting toward the south as it leaves to enter the town of Crooked"], [449, "MAYVILLE TOWNSHIP. 435 Germany in 1856, and bought a claim in section seventeen. John Meade came when this was a thinly settled country, and secured a claim on section nineteen. John O. Herron was one of the earliest settlers in Mayvide, and planted himself on section fourteen. He had previously hved in several different parts of the country, but still re sides on the old claim in Mayvide. Mr. P. Kelly was perhaps a still earlier comer. J. J. Reinhardt came to Mayvide in 1856, and located on section twenty-one where he now lives. T. J. Murphy came in October, 1854, and, at government price, bought 160 acres. At a later day he bought where he now lives, on section twenty-eight. The next year Mr. Jerry Galvin taught s school, which was also by subscription, in her own house. District No. 90.\u2014 In the fall of 1858 or '59, a district was organized, and school taught in avad able houses until 1865, when a schoolhouse was built on section four. District No. 43. \u2014 The organization of this dis trict was about 1858 or '59. The first school was in the house of Charles Murphy, and was under the instruction of Miss Mary Murphy. The first schoolhouse was built about 1859. The first Trustees were: Henry Wdtgen, James Connolly, and T. J. Murphy. The present Trustees are J. J. Reinhardt, T. J. Murphy, and Peter Klees. In 1866, the building was moved to section five, on the land of James Kennedy, who donated a lot for the purpose. Nicholas Neu pre-empted a claim on section twenty in 1857, and paid the government price, but afterwards sold and procured a place on sec tion nineteen, in 1866. He came from New York, and stopped over one winter in Chicago. Wins ton Taylor also came from New York, and ar rived here in 1855. District No. 34. \u2014 In the year 1876, a district was organized from No. 90, and a new house built on section eleven. The first teacher here was Ed ward Crow, of La Crescent.

The first religious services were in the house of T. J. Murphy, in 1860, by Rev. Father Essing. BIOGRAPHICAL. John E. Pope, a native of Chautauqua county, New York, was born on the 16th of February, 1836. He received his education in his native State, and in 1854, came with his father, J. Pope, to Minnesota, taking land in section thirty-six, Caledonia, and section thirty-one, Mayvide. John remaiued in Caledonia untd his marriage with Miss Betsy Woodward, whose nativity is the same as his own, the nuptials dating the 23d of October, 1859. Soon after marriage Mr. Pope went to Mississippi on account of failing health, taking his wiie with him and remaining about a year and a had. The war being fairly begun he found no little difficulty in getting away, an order having been issued to adow no northern man to leave the country untd after the war.

Phelps; Assessor, John Schminden ; Treasurer, James Connolly; Justices of the Peace, James Kennedy and John Schminden ; Constables, Wd liam Schminden and Peter Klein. In the early history of this town there seems to have been no very startling events. Those who colonized it came with the honest purpose of se curing homes, in which they succeeded. SCHOOLS. The first school inaugurated in town was in the residence of James Stapleton, and was presided over by Mrs. Stapleton, about the year 1857. It was what may be caded a subscription school."], [450, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 436 after built the residence he now occupies. He then began the practice of medicine which he con tinued untd about seven years ago, when he was stricken with disease, from the effects of which he has never fully recovered. He has since devoted his attention to agricultural pursuits. Eva L, and Charles L., the fruits of his marriage, are still liv ing at home. John Meade was born in Limerick county, Ireland, on the 31st of March, 1824. He came to America in 1840, and resided in Pennsylvania several years. While there he was united in mar riage with Miss Bridget Flynn, of Ireland, the event taking place in February, 1847. They came to Minnesota in 1853, and secured a claim in this then sparsely settled region. The first seasons were dry and Mr. Meade was obliged to go two miles after water. Brownsville was the principal trading post, the roads were irregular and regard less of lines or surveys, but by perseverance Mr. Meade has overcome these early embarrassments and now owns one of the best farms in this region. His wife died in 1860, having borne him four chil dren. In 1862, he married Mrs Bridget Davy, who died the following year. His present wife was Mrs. Ellen Sexton, whose birth place was Clare county, Ireland, the marriage taking place the 27th of October, 1867. Their home was for merly a part of Mayville, but now included in the village limits of Caledonia. James Kennedy, one of the organizers and first Supervisors of Mayvide, was born hi the county of Wexford, Ireland, on the 4th of June, 1827. He was reared on a farm, and came to America in 1852, settling in Freeport, Illinois, where he was employed on the railroad until 1855. He then came to this place and located in section five. Mr. Kennedy was one of the organizers of his school district, and one of its first officers; has also held several terms of town office.

DESCRIPTIVE \u2014 FIRST SETTLEMENT MANUFACTUR- ING CHURCHES SCHOOLS \u2014 VILLAGE BIO- GRAPHICAL. The Root River meanders along its southern border which approximately follows the river. The creek from which it takes its name, comes into the town by several branches from the north, in the eastern part, and uniting, flow south into Root River. There is more valley than ridge land in the town, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. It is quite well settled and has many fine farms. The Southern Minnesota railroad passes through the southern part of the town at several points as it follows the Root River valley, and there is a flag station on section swenty-six. This town was originally called Hamilton, but when the act was passed by the Legislature forbid ding the use of the same name for more than one town or city in the State, this township, which had a duplicate antedating it as to the time of its organ ization, was required to take a new name. Some man having got his pocket-book and contents wet in the creek, and spreading out the bank notes on a bush to dry, a sudden gust of wind blew them into the water again, and some of it was never re covered, so this circumstance suggested the name of the stream, after which the town was named. It is located in the northwest corner of the county, with Winona county on the north, Hous ton township on the east, Houston and Yucatan on First Settlers. \u2014 John Campbell and Nathan Vance, who had been living in Wisconsin, made several excursions through this region in search of"], [451, "MONEY CREEK TOWNSHIP. 437 an eligible mid site, and finady in the early spring of 1853, Mr. Campbell located 320 acres of land, which afterwards proved to be in section twelve, and included what is now the village of Money Creek, and the site of the flouring mill. Campbell was a native of Scotland, coming to America at the age of five years. with Mr. Campbell and located about the same time, taking a claim adjoining, and after opening up a farm and cultivating it a few years, built a store, which must have been in 1862 or '63. He afterwards engaged in milling, but finally failed in business, and about 1878, with his family, went to Dakota where he stid lives. Captain Bates, who had been in charge of a steamer on the Mississippi, came here from La Crosse in the early spring of 1854. His claim was in section eight, where John Campbell now re sides. He remained about two years, returned to La Crosse, and afterwards removed to Arkansas, where it is understood he lost his hfe during the war. On arriving here, whde prospecting, and after locating the claim, Vance and himself occupied an abandoned wigwam or \"tepee\" as the Winneba goes called them. On one occasion, not long after their coming, they were quite badly frightened by a sudden eruption of Indians, who came yelling and whooping in a most blood-curdling and hair elevating way, but this proved to be an en ergetic freak on their part, as they made no fur ther hostile demonstrations, and after receiving a few trifling presents, they peacefully withdrew. As the spring advanced Mr. Campbell broke about fifteen acres, put in corn and potatoes, and also put up a shanty, remaining on the ground a part of the season, being at that time the only man in town and, \"Monarch of all he surveyed.\" Late in the fad he returned to Wisconsin. The next winter, toward spring, in 1854, he returned here with his family bringing cows, oxen, hogs, etc., and re-occupied his shanty. He soon began the erection of a mill but did not push it very vigor ously, or to completion at once, preferring to wait until the land should regularly be in the market, that he might be certain of a clear title to the premises. After it was finally completed it was not unlike, as to its primitive characteristics, most of the mills first erected in this region. It had no bolting arrangements, and but a single run of stones. But when the neigh borhood had begun to have settlers who had succeeded in raising grain, they resorted to this mill, and the circle kept widening until from far and near they came, crowd ing it to its utmost capacity, and some of them would have to wait one or two days for their grists, and after filling his log house, the overflow would sleep in the mill. After the land was opened up for sale the claim was purchased by Mr. Campbed. The mid was not completed un til after that time, but it answered its purpose for a number of years and was most valuable to the whole community. It is a pleasure to record the fact that Mr. Campbell still resides in town. Charles Williams came at the same time, in the spring of 1854, from New York, by the way of La Crosse. He settled on section five, where Mr. L. Woods now hves. He was a mill-wright and re mained here ten or twelve years, then removed to Minneapolis where he now dves. Russell Thurber came soon after Campbell, in the spring of 1854; he was also from La Crosse; his claim was adjoining the town site, where he lived for a number of years and then went to Wi nona, where he died in 1866. Cyrus B. Sinclair, a native of Maine, also came here from La Crosse, in the spring of 1854. He entered a claim in section seven and lived here eight or ten years, then removed to Pleasant Hid, Winona county. He was an enterprising man, in terested in the development of the town, was the first Postmaster and did the first blacksmi thing. He was a member of the Territorial Legislature, and since removing to Winona, he has been in the State Legislature. His son, Wdliam, stid resides in the town, and is one of the most prominent among its citizens. In 1857, he opened the first regular blacksmith shop here and still keeps its fires burning. Stephen Robinson came on with Mr. Sinclair, and purchased a claim of Wilds Thompson, who had made some improvements. Mr. Robinson was originady from Maine, and had previously visited the territory and selected a place in what is now Goodhue county, but coming with Mr. Sinclair he concluded to remain here on section nineteen, where he stid dves. On selling his improvements to Mr. Robinson, Mr. Thompson secured another claim on section thirty, which had a water-power which was afterwards transferred to Mr. John Nathan Vance was a native of Salem, Vermont, and, as already mentioned, came to Money Creek"], [452, "438 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. Stewart. Mr. Thompson, in the exuberance of his hopeful anticipations, platted a city and named it Christiania, in honor of the capital of his native Norway, but with an obstinacy, which must have been exceedingly refrigerating to his enthusiastic nature, this town refused to be transferred from the original parchment on which it was drawn. Mr. Stewart soon improved his property by build ing a saw mid, and subsequently a grist-mill, with a single ran of stones, and finally another run of stones for feed. which he had come into possession, and the avad able machinery was transferred to the new struc ture. This mill, which is still standing and in active operation, is 34x50 feet, two and one-half stories high, with an addition which has been con structed since the mill was first built. This mill operates three run of four foot buhrs, cockle ma chine, two middlings purifiers, com shelters, and other machinery to do first-class work. The ca pacity of the mill is eight bushels per hour, and does an average dady business of fifty bushels, and about the same amount of feed, buckwheat, and rye. This mill passed into the hands of John Phelps, in September, 1879, who in the spring of 1881 took J. G. Murphy as a partner, and he now has charge of the mid, whde Mr. Phelps is en gaged in the stock business. This mill is known as the Money Creek Flouring Mid. Besides those already mentioned who settled in that year, were Noah F. Berry, who secured a claim in section one, where his brother Cyrus now lives. His father Nathan, and his brothers came soon afterwards. These were the first settlers in the eastern part of the township, and a more extended notice of most of them appears elsewhere. About the same time, colonists were arriving and taking lands in the Root River valley, in the southeast corner of the present township. Prominent among these were the following : Martin Christianson, condng from Norway and taking a claim in the spring of 1854, in section twenty-six, where he still remains. About the same time came Ole Omodt and bought out a squatter named Spaulding, on section twenty-six, where Mr. Omodt lives. Others came in soon after, principally Norwegians, and this portion of the valley in Money Creek is stdl oc cupied by them and their descendants, and is as flourishing and prosperous as any part of the county. MONEY LAKE MILL. As before mentioned a saw-mill was budt on section thirty by John Stewart, about 1857, and some two years later he budt a grist mdl with a single run of stones, and with bolting facilities. Some time in 1877, or thereabouts, Mr. John Siman purchased the property and gave the mill a complete overhauling, adding quite an amount of new machinery. It now has four run of stones with smutters, purifiers, etc., and one set of rolls. It is propelled by two wheels rated at thirty horse power each. BRICK YARD. Many years ago Stephen Robinson commenced the manufacture of brick on his farm, which proved to be of a good quality. At first they were moulded by hand in the old fashioned way, but about 1870, he procured a machine, and since that time the manufacture has been extensive. On the ridge towards the northwest corner of the town, immigrants began to appear about 1855. Among the first of these were Samuel Nichols and his son S. A. Nichols, Phil. Mohan, J. McLeod, and several others. MANUFACTURING. The brick used in the construction of the county jail in Caledonia, were from this yard, and numer ous other buildings in Caledonia and other towns in the county have thus been supphed. This is a most important industry. The first mids erected in town have already been alluded to, and include the grist-mill of Mr. Campbed, put here in 1854, and the saw-mill the following year. This latter contained a single sash saw, and was kept in operation about fifteen years. In 1859, Mr. Campbell put up a flouring mid opposite the old one, with one run of stones, a smutter and bolter. In 1861, this mill was sold to Mr. Stacy, who introduced another run of stones and other improved machinery. A few years later it passed into the hands of Nathan Vance, who put up another mill on the site of the original one, of TANNERY. A tannery was established by Mr. J. Emery, near Money Creek, in 1866.

About 1879, the two Baptist societies built a church together, which is neat,and in all respects a credit to the congregation and the town. At times there have been two ministers but usuady a single pastor administers to the spiritual requirements of both. At present Rev. David D. Mitched, who resides in Houston, is the pastor. He is the resident pastor of the Free Bap tist church in Houston. The Free Baptist church, as it is now caded, in Money Creek has about fifty members and the other a considerably smader number.

Up to the year 1862 or '63, there was but one school in the whole township, and this was kept in a log building erected in 1856 ; it is still standing opposite Sinclair's blacksmith shop. The first teacher here was Charles Tiffany. This school house was a general utilitarian affair, serving as a meeting house and town hall, as wed as school room, until the Methodist church was constructed. This is now District No. 7. The first trustees were Nathan Perkins, Stephen Robinson, Peter Tuper and James Greenfield. Services before the church was built were in the school house. Rev. Mr. Kidder was succeeded by Rev. W. B. Podng; Rev. Ira Elling wood, sometimes sup plied his place from some other charge. On the 9th of May, 1859 Rev.Ezra Smith was sent here by the conference, and since that time it has been a regular station, with a stated service by a regular pastor. A school house was put up just northeast of the vidage, a few years after the one above men tioned, which served until the fad of 1881, when a new schoolhouse, with modern improvements was erected. It is 28x48 feet with two vestibules, 10x16 feet, one on either side. In it is taught a graded school of two departments. C. P. Bourne is the principal, and Miss Butler is the assistant. The present minister is Rev. Jotham W. Steb bins, a native of Windom county, Vermont, who, after serving in the war of the Rebellion untd its close in 1865, returned home and practiced dent istry.

It is now located in Emery's store. District No. 8. \u2014 This has a location in the southern part of the town. A schoolhouse had been partially completed in the early part of the war, but some of the people felt that if all the men had got to go to the front, there would be little use for schoolhouses, so the building re mained incomplete, and no school was kept here un td one or two years after the war was over. The first teacher was Miss Mary Pierce, who resided on the south side of the river in Houston town ship. After the war the house was completed. MONEY CREEK VILLAGE. During the autumn of 1856, the village was platted by Mr. John Campbell, the first lot being sold to Mr. Stolls, who erected a tavern and kept it for several years ; it is now occupied as a resi dence by Mr. J. G. Murphy. Soon after the vd lage was surveyed, one-half of the plat was sold to Mr. Goodrich, of the firm of Draper & Goodrich, who at once built a store and occupied it with a stock of goods for about two years, when the bus iness waa transferred to some other place. District No. 89. \u2014 Is located on the ridge in the northern part of the town. The first school was taught in the summer of 1876. The school building is a frame, which cost probably $500. Thomas Lane was the first teacher. Thirty pupils are now enrolled here, with Miss Carrie Gosdne, of Houston, as teacher. Mr. G. Bissett succeeded to the business here, and with a partner kept up the store for perhaps two years, when it passed into the possession of Wood & Vance, who, after a certain time, dissolved the partnership, and Mr. Vance alone managed the concern for some time. In February, 1875, the firm of Corey & Emery took charge of the estab lishment, and a year later Mr. Emery became the sole proprietor of the business, which must be of a thorough character, judging from the exact ness of the pedigree which has been preserved.

District No. 96. \u2014 A school was first taught in this district in an old log house belonging to Ole R. Berland, in 1879. During the summer of 1881, the schoolhouse was erected; it is 16x24 feet. The first to wield the rod of authority in the old log house was Miss Jennie Winslow, whose sister now manages the school in the new house. Another store was started by Mr. E. R. Ward in 1868 or '69, and he afterwards sold to Nathan Vance, who removed the stock of goods he already had to his new purchase. After a time this store was discontinued, and Mr. Emery, having enlarged and otherwise improved it, now does business in the old store. ORGANIZATION.

He has three children; Jessie B., Ella M., and Ross B., who reside with their mother and grand-mother on the old homestead. December, 1873, he was joined in marriage with Miss Lillie Johnson, of Pleasant Hid, the fruits of which union are two children, Nellie A., and Mor ton J. Mr. Robinson owns a fine brick house, sit uated a short distance south of his father's, and a well improved farm. His brother, Taylor, lives just north of his father; a sister, who is the wife of Frank Perkins, resides in the house Mr. Robinson, Sr. built when first coming here, situ ited just over the line in Winona county, and a brother, Henry, resides with his parents on the old homestead. John Siman was born in Germany, but when eleven years old came to America, locating in Waukesha, Wisconsin, where he learned the mil ler's trade. In 1863, he came to Martin county, Minnesota, but soon after moved to Winnebago City, where he purchased a mill and afterward built another, operating both for several years. Subsequently he traded the latter for his present mid, which he remodeled, put in new machinery, and increased its capacity. He married Miss Ann Smart, of English parentage. She has borne him four children, Andrew, who now owns a half in terest in the mill at Winnebago formerly owned by our subject, Adie, William, and Harry. Russell H. Thurber, deceased, was a native of Franklin county, Vermont, born on the 11th of June, 1825. He came with his parents to Wal worth county, Wisconsin, in 1845. In 1851, he was united in marriage with Miss Margaret M. Beals, of Walworth county, and soon after moved to La Fayette county, in the same State. In 1852, he removed to La Crosse, and thence, in the spring of 1854, to Money Creek. He had for several years been employed as a millwright, and con tinued that occupation here for some time. His health failing he removed to Winona in 1861, and engaged in the sale of farm machinery, continu ing in that business untd his death on the 27th of August, 1866. Mrs. Thurber remained in Winona untd 1875, when she purchased property in Wa seca and now resides there. Two chddren were born to Mr. and Mrs. Thurber; the eldest, Wdliam R., in La Fayette county, Wisconsin, on the 5th of April, 1852. For a number of years he was employed, first as brakeman and then conductor on the Winona and St. Peter railroad, but was acidentady kided by a coldsion at Minneapolis on the 8th of September, 1881. The youngest, George H., was born in La Crosse, Wisconsin, on the 30th of August, 1853. He was also employed David W. Robinson is a son of Stephen Robinson, one of the prominent pioneers of this place, bom in Kennebec county, Maine, on the 20th of Sep tember, 1809. He learned the brickmaking trade at Albion, at which he was employed in different parts of the State. On the 15th of January, 1829, he married Miss Betsey Felker, of Somerset county. Mr. Robinson came to Minnesota and took a claim a few miles from Red Wing, returned to Maine, and on making his second trip west met an old friend, who persuaded him to accompany him to this place, and being pleased with the country Mr. Robinson decided to remain. David was born in Kennebec county, on the 26th of Oc tobea, 1844. He came here with his parents, and in 1861, enlisted in the Second Minnesota Cavalry, Company K, participating in the Indian campaign. During a blizzard, in which seven of the company were frozen to death, he had one of his feet frozen, on account of which he receives a pension.

Amanda, the eldest, is married and resides in Iowa; Lovina, the second, is also married and lives in Wisconsin ; Jane and Henry are yet unmarried and reside with their parents. Mrs. Thurber's father, Widiam Beals, was a sol dier in the war of 1812, passing through untold hardships being at one time three days without food. He was a prisoner of war at Quebec for over a year. His death occurred in Green county, Wisconsin, in October, 1854. William A. Vance is a son of A. Vance, who was born in Caledonia county, Vermont, on the 14th of October, 1812. He moved to Groton where he learned the shoemaker's trade, at which he was engaged in his native State until coming west. His wife was Miss Lucinda A. Tucker, a grand-daughter of Col. Robert Johnston, who served in the Revolutionary war, and was among the early settlers in Vermont. William was born in Barnet, Vermont, on the 5th of April, 1843. He came to Money Creek with his parents in 1865, but soon returned east and was engaged in different occupations, remaining in Boston two years. In March, 1872, he was united in marriage with Miss Gray, of New Brunswick, who is now deceased. The maiden name of his present wife was Abbie Symes, of Ryegate, whom he married on the 12th of Januay, 1875. She has borne him three chil dren, Hattie B., Ethel May, and Minnie Gray. Mr. Vance has held the office of Supervisor and district Clerk, and in 1880, took the census of the town. He is also a member and Superintendent of the Sunday school of Money Creek. He has a brother, George L., now residing in Joliet, Rlinois, who served for a time in the quartermaster de partment at Washington; another, David E., en lieted in a Vermont regiment, served three years, was taken prisoner at Harper's Ferry, and now is engaged in the practice of law at Winona, and a sister, who is the wife of D. C. Dyer, of Houston. Peter Tuper is a native of New York, born in Herkimer county, on the 1st of September, 1823. When he was quite young his parents moved to Albany county, and thence to Saratoga county. Since the age of fifteen years Peter has depended upon himsed for his own support, and when twenty cared for both his parents. His father died on the 21st of Aprd, 1852. In 1846, Miss Maria Lasher became the wife of Mr. Tuper. She died on the 10th of November, 1848. In 1849, he was joined in matrimony with Miss Maria Carter, whose father served in the war of 1812, and also the revo lutionary war, living tdl the age of one hundred and five years. In the fall of 1856, they came to Fond du Lac county, Wisconsin, and remained until the spring of 1861, when they moved to Money Creek, where Mr. Tuper purchased a farm of William Sinclair and has since made it his home. In January, 1864, he enlisted in the First Minnesota Battery, served with Sherman through the campaign from Vicksburg to the sea, and was discharged on the 2d of July, 1865. Mr. Tuper has held an office most of the time since his resi dence in the State, is at present Chairman of the Board of Supervisors; is also a prominent member of the Methodist Church.

There was a heavy growth of black wal nut timber along the Root River, which could be cut and rafted down to the Mississippi, and sev eral parties availed themselves of this opening. They built temporary cabins, and cutting out the best timber, laid claim to everything in sight on account of these \"improvements,\" as this vandal ism was caded, and then selhng their questionable rights to men seeking homes. This part of the county was thus captured by the supplementary land office operators, early in the fifties. CHAPTER LXI. GENERAL DESCRIPTION EARLY SETTLEMENT PO- LITICAL ORGANIZATION MANUFACTURING MER- CANTILE LORETTE HOUSE \u2014 RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS BIOGRAPHICAL. The township bearing this name is the second from the Mississippi River on the northern line of Houston county. It has Winona county on the north, La Crescent on the east, Union on the south, and Houston en the west. The name of the town was suggested by Dr. Chase, an old res ident, in remembrance of a remarkable rounded bluff in section four, surrounded by a wide valley on all sides. This was originally a part of Union and La Crescent. The first man to make a claim withiu the pres ent limits of the township, as far as can be learned, was John Crypts, a German by birth. His first business was getting out black walnut logs, and he is said to have employed the Indians to assist in this work. It is claimed that his family was with him, and that a daughter was born soon alter his coming ; if so that would be the first birth in the town. But, James Carrigan, it is claimed, is en titled to that distinction. It is certain that Mr. Crypts had a daughter, wherever she was born, and that she grew to womanhood and was mar ried, and hved near Brownsvdle. Mr. Crypts' claim, or one of them, was south of the river on section thirty -four, where Mr. W. Connington now resides. He did considerable land speculation for those early days. The town is eight and one-half miles from north to south, and five miles wide, and includes a part of two government townships. The Root River bisects the town a little south of the center, in an irregidar course from the west, with a tendency toward the south. Several branches join it in this town, both from the north and from the south. Crystal Creek cuts across the southwestern corner, and Pine Creek, from Winona county, runs through section four. The general topography is in harmony with the other towns in the county, and along Root River there are valleys, bluffs, and ridges, the latter in quite an extensive plateau north of the center. Thomas Van Sickle, originally from Pennsyl vania, came, it is quite likely, in 1852, and engaged in running off black walnut timber and in the claim business. He located himsed on section four, a mile or south of the river. After selling his right, title, and interest in this place he went across the river to section twenty-one, but was not long in disposing of this claim to James C. Day, when he removed to Iowa and afterwards to Brownsvdle in this county, where he died a few years ago. The railroad runs in the vadey of the Root River, and there is a station and a Post-office on section twenty-eight, which, in the case of this town, is near the geographical center. There is httle unproductive land, except the sharp sides of the bluffs, and d land was scarce even these could be utdized. EARLY SETTLEMENT. There are conflicting claims as to the personnel"], [462, "448 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. James C. Day was also from the Key Stone State, and cultivated the farm for a few years, then sold to the present occupant, Mr. P. Eberhard, and removed to La Crescent, where he run a ferry boat. Jacob Bush came here from Hokah in 1853 or '54, and secured a claim in what is called Bush Vadey, on section twenty-six. In 1855, he began the erection of a saw-mill and a dam, and had them nearly completed when the dam was washed away by one of those remorseless floods that have so httle regard for human hopes. He abandoned the enterprise, and soon afterwards went to Cali fornia, leaving his family, but returned in a few years and took them to Oregon, after seding his property. 1877. The old gentleman, Seth Lore, was a na tive of New Jersey, and at one time lost heavily by the wreck of -a merchant vessel in which his means were invested. He was one of the founders of Ironton, Alabama, on the Chattahoochee River, where he did a large business in connection with John Forsyth, formerly Spanish Minister, and Hon. Alfred Iverson, a senator from Georgia. His daughter, Mrs. C. B. Carpenter, came soon after her father. She was the first Clerk of the district and the first woman in the State to hold that position. James Stowe came about the same time and took a claim on section eight. He was from Augusta, Maine, and died about 1864. In 1855, the proclivity to lay out cities and vil lages struck this locality, and Dr. Sheldon, having become impressed with the necessity, had a vidage surveyed and platted, ard bestowed upon it the castilian name of \"San Jacinto.'' It was on Wm. Hunter's land, but its remains would be quite as difficult to find as some of the ancient histori cal cities of Asia. Henry P. Eberhard came from Prussia to Wash ington county, Wisconsin, in 1843, and in the spring of 1854, came to this township and secured eighty acres on section twenty-one. He has one son, J. A., who resides at the station and keeps the only store in town, and is also station and ex press agent. Another son, Philip, is on section twenty-one, on the Van Sickle claim. The initial marriage is supposed to have been that of Mr. Christian Zeigler and Miss Sophia Eb erhard, in 1856. Dr. J. G. Sheldon came in 1856, and located on section thirty-three. The first death, as near as can be remembered, was a child of Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Heffner, and the mother soon followed the little one. Abraham Millhauser located on sections twenty one, twenty-two, and twenty-seven and the next year built a dam, but subsequently moved to La Crosse and there built a steam saw-mid, which is now owned by Mr. Paul. After a year or so he returned and joined the great majority in 1858. The earliest birth must have been a son to Van Sickle, in the spring of 1853. As already men tioned, it is possible that Mr. Crypt's daughter antedates this. His son, A. A. Millhauser, was born in Pennsyl vania in February, 1851. He was married to Elizabeth Krohler in 1878, and soon after bought the farm where he now lives, on section eight. He is now Chairman of the town board. Philip G. Vix, a native of France, came to Wisconsin in 1845, and over here in 1854, locating where he may be still found, on section twenty-nine. He had a family of two sons and one daughter.the oldest son and daughter still living in town. POLITICAL ORGANIZATION. The town was originally taken from Union and La Crescent. The first town meeting of which there is a record, was at the house of Jesse Hewitt in April, 1860.\" There were sixty-two votes cast. Isaac Holmes was Moderator, and the following officers were chosen: Supervisors, George Can non, Chairman, Jacob Bush, and George Larson; Assessor, Jacob Krohler; Town Clerk, Wm. Con nington; Treasurer, Seth Lore, and Superintend ent of Schools, Andrew Orr. Edward S. Lore arrived in the spring of 1855. His father, Seth, afterwards came. Their place was on the north ridge. Edward S. removed to Jackson county, taking a claim on the Des Moines River, and at the time of the Sioux Massacre in 1862, he was the only man who effected an escape from the doomed settlement. He gave the alarm and finally made his way back to Mound Prairie. He died while on a visit to friends in the east in The affairs of the town have been faithfully cared for; it being a farming community with few expenditures, except for highways and schools, the burden of taxation for local purposes has never been excessive. The present town officers are: Supervisors, A. A. Millhauser, Chairman, Charles Lehman, and Wm. Connington; Town Clerk, H. Herzog; Treas-"], [463, "MOUND PRAIRIE TOWNSHIP. 449 urer, J. A. Eberhard; Assessor, H. Niebuhr; Jus tices of the Peace, Fred Frey and H. R. Sheldon; Constables, Wm. Eglinton and George Bailey. The attempts to use water as a motive power having thus far failed, Mr. James McLaughlin has invoked a power that requires no figuring to de termine its rate, which is four horse power, as the animals themselves do the work, with a machine not unlike that employed in running a threshing machine. He has a feed mill of his own inven tion, so constructed that com in the ear is ground with one operation, without preparatory crushing. The stones have a diameter of three feet four inches, are of sandstone taken from the bluff near by, and have a capacity for grinding 150 bushels of corn a day, and a larger amount of small grain. POST-OFFICES. A Post-office was secured about the year 1855, and it was named San Jacinto, in honor of the decisive battle in the struggle for Texan independ ence, and of which Gen. Sam Houston was the hero. It was at first where Wm. Orr now lives. Mr. Cannon was the first Postmaster, and Dr. Sheldon was afterwards in office. Lorette Post-Office. \u2014 In 1856, a Post-office was located at the Lorette House and Mr. E. S. Lore held the postal keys. Mrs. Anna M. Price, a sister of the Postmaster was appointed deputy the following spring, and had charge until it was discontinued, except a single year, when David Davis was Postmaster. In 1869 both these offices were discontinued and the Mound Prairie office established, with Mr. J. A. Eberhard in charge. MERCANTILE. At quite an early day a store was opened by Charles Chase on the Sheldon farm, and the firm afterwards became Chase & Andrew Orr. While the railroad was building, Mr. D. J. Cameron had a small stock of goods near the station. In 1868, J. A. Eberhard opened a store at the station in a small budding, and the next year put up his pres ent store. He keeps a general line of merchan dise suitable for country trade. MANUFACTURING. Mound Prairie cannot be said to be a manufac turing town, although several more or less success ful attempts have been made in this direction, and an account of what has been done wid be here presented. ' THE LORETTE HOUSE. No history of this region would be complete or satisfactory without a sketch of this noted tavern. It was on the old territorial road from La Crosse to St. Paul, and was the first principal stopping place after leaving La Crosse. It was constructed by Seth Lore and kept by him until 1861, and since then Mrs. C. B. Carpenter, his daughter, has been the hostess. It was a log house, 18x20 feet, with three rooms on the ground floor and a cham ber above, and an extension back of the building as a cook room. In early times this was a stop ing place for three lines of stages, and not unfre quently seventy persons would be accommodated with dinners. On the old register may be found the names of General Sibley, Governor Ramsey, Judge Goodrich, Major McCullom, Captain Rol lins, Colonel Allyn, Lords Cavendish and Groes nor, Sir William Ashley, with numerous Big In dians, including \"Hole-in-the-Day,\" \"Bastie,\" and others. In 1853 or '54, Jacob Bush built a dam across the creek in section twenty-six, and nearly com pleted a saw-mill 24x40 feet, of very heavy timber, 18 inches square. A wheel was ready to be placed in position, when a sudden freshet proved too much for the dam to resist and it left its proprie tor, to accompany the mad current on its way to Gulf. A little more strength in the dam, and a little less in the mill, might have prevented this catastrophe. Mr. Bush complained that he had been deceived by others who were connected with the enterprise, and he made no effort to repair the mischief. The mill stood for years as a monument of the dismal failure, and the timbers stid lie scattered about the place. A second attempt was made, in 1856, to build a mill to saw lumber and grind grain. Mr. Abra ham Millhauser was the moving spirit in the en terprise. A dam was thrown across the Dayville, or Hanson Creek, in section twenty-two, but the first rise in the stream took it along in quest of its companion somewhere below, and so this attempt to utilize the water power of the town likewise proved a contretemps. The house was noted for its immense fire place, which took up one-half of a side of the budding. In 1859, a frame addition was budt. 20x30 feet, and two stories in height. When the railroads be gan operations this old hostelry, around which clustered so many associations, was left stranded 29"], [464, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 450 on the shores of a new era, as a solitary land mark of an age gone to return never more, and remind ing us that: \"Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis.\" ward Lorr, who were removed here.

Previous to this time services had been held at private residences and schoolhouses. One of the earliest ministers was Rev. Mr. Ges. Others remembered are, Pau ling, Stagner, Charles Brill, H. Bunce, Empte, Kabel, Kuter, and Mr. Kienholz, who was here when the church was built. The present pastor is George Jahn, a native of France, who came to this country when young. He was here the year after the church was built, and after laboring in other fields came back in 1879. There is a Sun day school connected with this church, with seventy children who attend.

German Reform Church. \u2014 Zion Society was organized on the 15th of July, 1877, there hav ing been preaching here a year or more before this time. Julius Granel was the pastor and there were eight members, but there are only six now. Peter Mades was the first elder, and the trustees were Oswald Lofi and Peter Mades. A church was budt in 1877, 24x32 feet, at a cost of $950. Wm. Mades was the treasurer. The first minister who had a regular appointment after the church was constructed, was Rev. Mr. Graveland who re mained three years. Rev B. R. Hinker was oc casionally here. In the season of 1882, Rev. A. Kanne and Rev. Mr. Routgren preached on alter nate Sundays. The present treasurer is George Senn. There is a Sunday school connected with the church. District No. 14. \u2014 The first term here was by Andrew Orr, in 1858, in a budding put up by Mr. Fairbanks. That same fall a frame building was erected opposite Dr. Sheldon's house. In 1872, the house was removed to the south side of the prairie, on section nine, where it now accommo dates a larger number of pupils. District No. 62. \u2014 This was organized in 1866, and a log house put up the same year, 20x16 feet, and paid foi by voluntary contributions. It is located on section twenty-six.

George Larson is a native of Norway, born on the 15th of October, 1832. His parents came to America, locating in Dane county, Wisconsin, when George was. quite young. In 1852, he made a trip through this county in company with T. Halverson, and the following spring took the claim on which he now lives. In 1854, he erected a log house and his parents joined him, residing with him until the death of his father in 1868. Mr. Larson enlisted in Company F, of the Tenth Min nesota Infantry, in August, 1862. After the In dian massacre he helped bring about four hundred Indian prisoners to Mankato; then assisted in re moving the Winnebagoes to their reservation on the Missouri river. In July, 1863, he returned to Fort Sneding, and in the fall was sent south,where he participated in the battles of Nashville, Fort Blakeley, and Spanish Fort, receiving an honora ble discharge in August, 1865. He was joined in matrimony in July, 1871, with Mrs. Annie Han son. The fruits of this union are three children ; Inga Julia, Emma Helline, and Tilda Josephine. Mrs. Larson had one daughter, Bede, by her first husband. Louis Vix was born in France, in 1841, and came to America with his parents and other rela tives when four years old. They located in the then territory of Wisconsin, in Watertown, Dodge county. In the spring of 1854, they moved to Minnesota, settling in Mound Prairie, Houston county. In the spring of 1860, Mr. Vix made a trip to Kansas, pre-empted land near Lawrence, but sold a month later, and went to Kansas City. He then went, in the employ of the government, through the Indian Territory to the Arkansas river ; thence to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and back to the Arkansas river up to El Paso and Canon City; thence up the Platte river to Fort Kearney and back to Leavenworth, Kansas, St. Louis, Mis souri, and finally to Minnesota. In 1863, he made a claim in Blue Earth county, upon which he made some improvements, but on his re'urn, after a visit home, found it jumped. He then came to this place and purchasedland in section twenty-nine where he now lives. In 1865, he enlisted in the Ninth Illinois Cavalry, Company L; was in several battles, and mustered out the 31st of October, 1865, at Selma, Alabama.

Rasse was born in Kanawha county, West Virginia, the 27th of June, 1857. He at tended the schools near his home, and completed SHELDON. the opposite bluff, which, when it was surveyed, proved to be in section twenty-one. This hardy pioneer was born in Norway, in June, 1827. He came to Dane county, Wisconsin, in 1850, where he bought 40 acres of land, and on his coming here realized $110 for it. He was married to Miss Haya Halverson in 1847. He had the contract for the carpenter work on the schoolhouse in district No. 3, now No. 23. \u2022 He also helped raise the first mill ever budt in town, that of Brown's, at Sheldon. He still makes his own shoes from leather tanned by himself, by a process he learned in his own country. He first claimed 160 acres but a part of it was \"jumped\" two years afterwards. CHAPTER LXII. DESCRIPTIVE EARLY SETTLEMENT VILLAGE OF SHELDON RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS BIOGRAPHICAL. This is a government township, with the excep tion of the first six sections, which are in Houston, the town to the north. It is one of the four interior towns in the comity. Union is on the east, Caledonia on the south, and Yucatan on the west. The South Fork of Root River crosses the northwestern part of the township, and Badger Creek runs from near the center of the southern border almost due north to join the Root River, which runs near the northern border, and Beaver Creek runs north in the western part of the town. These rivers have the characteristic vadeys, bordered by the bluffs and ridges, and with another valley on the ex treme east, makes the town sufficiently uneven to gratify the most variegated taste as to hill and dale. The township is quite well settled, and has many fine farms. Andrew's claim fell on section sixteen. He also took 160 acres and lived on it nine or ten years, when it was sold and the family went to Dakota. Andrew Jermonson took 160 acres and lived on it two yaars, when he died. In the spring of 1854, Ole Targeson with his family came over from Dane county, Wisconsin, to which place he had come the year before from his native Norway. Two of his sons had preceded him to this country. He was born on the 4th of September, 1794, and died in March, 1881, 87 years of age. His wife had gone before on the 16th of September, 1870. All the chddren of this aged couple, except a daughter who married Mr. B. Swan, one of the early settlers in Sheldon who afterwards moved to Iowa, are stid hving in the vicinity. Levi Oleson occupies the old homestead. EARLY SETTLEMENT. The first claim taken was probably by a native of Norway, named Gutorm Guttarsen, who located 160 acres on sections seven and eight. He came here in June, 1853, from Rock county, Wisconsin, where he had lived since 1846. Michael Michael son and his brother, Andrew, and Andrew Jer monson, arrived about the same time, or within two weeks, and selected their respective claims wdiile sitting on top of the bluff east of Badger Valley, Michael taking the one furthest toward In the southeast part of the town, the first man to surround a claim was John Brown, and then"], [468, "454 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. Benjamin Swan, in 1854. Brown's timber abode was planted about thirty rods northeast of where Mr. Neubury's house now stands, and was really the first house in the village of Sheldon. He was an enterprising man and put up a saw-mill on the present site of Schneider's flouring mid. This was a single verticle saw, and the very first in the town or vidage of Sheldon. For a time Mr. Paddock kept a hotel, and he con tinued in town for about ten years, when he re turned to Illinois, and eventually broke his neck by a fall from a load of hay. George Brenneman also kept a store here at an early day. The first death must have been the child of this family, which was on the 29th of September, 1857. Some time in 1856, Mr. John E. Homme, a Nor wegian, established himself on section eighteen, taking 120 acres, to which he has since addad 175 more. Mr. Homme was left fatherless when ten years of age and has since fought his way through the world. He learned the carpenter's trade by the time he was nineteen years old, and first came to Dane couuty, Wisconsin, in 1854. One. of his sons, E. 1 . Homme, is an eminent Lutheran min ister, an editor of a periodical, and the founder of a Home for the Friendless, in the interest of Lu theran Societies. Mr. Brown, who was a Scotchman by birth, came here from Wisconsin and remained until about 1874, and went to the Red River, where he remained until his death, which happened in 1880, as the result of a runaway accident, throw ing him from his wagon and breaking his neck. Mr. Swan opened bis farm just north, and his local habitation was where John Roup now lives. He remained on this spot up to 1873 or '74, and then removed to Iowa, where he still reside\". He married a daughter of Ole Targeson. She is a sis ter of Levi and Henry Oleson. In 1857, a Mr. Seeley built a grist-mdl neqr the saw-mill. Mr. John Phelps assisted in its construction and was afterwards owner of the mill for several years. These mills were both purchased by Joseph Schneider in 1868, and in 1875, they were re placed by the mill now standing, which contains four run of stones with the middlings purifiers, smutters, and other machinery now used in a first class mill. Another prominent citizen and old settler is Henry Wilson, a Norwegian sador, who, from the age of sixteen until coming to America and locat ing here in 1855, followed the sea, visiting various ports in Europe, America, Spain, and Russia, doubling Cape Horn, and up the Pacific coast as far as Oregon. He also visited other places in cluding the Atlantic American ports. On com ing here he bought 160 acres on section nineteen. He has held various town offices and is a highly respected citizen. The year following Brown's arrival, a Mr. Cook meandered around this way and built a house which has since been enlarged, and is now occu pied by Mr. Martin Neubury as a hotel, and it is now the only one in town. The settlement of the \"Ridge,\" in the eastern part of the town was initiated by Jerry Cunningham, a native of the \"Emerald Isle,\" who landed in New York in 1851, and procured work where he could find it, in New York, Virginia, Ohio, and in the Lake Superior copper mines, where he wrought eighteen months. He finady came here, arriving the year of the first land sale, 1854; and bought 160 acres in section thirteen. A few years after ward he constructed one of those unimposing resi dences so fashionable at that time, of unhewn logs, in which he lived with his family for several years, when he put up the house he now dves in, which is in accordance with the later fashions. In 1857, he was married to Miss Ellen Haggerty. They have seven living chddren. During one of those early years another emigrant from the \"Ever green isle,\" came upon section thirty -six. This was John Mur phy, who came to America as early as 1836, and for a time worked as a \"long shoreman,\" and was married in Boston in 1840. He remained here up In 1856, Mr. Moses Woods, a miller by trade, put in an appearance and erected a smad slab house in which he opened up a stock of goods. this was the first store in the place, and was kept running for about a year when Mr. Woods with drew from the trade, which was never very ponder ous in his little warehouse. In 1857, Mr. John Paddock, from Illinois, ar rived with a good assortment of merchandise. About this time the Post-office was established and kept at this store, with Mr. Paddock as Post master. The first religious service was held at his house, and he was also the first Justice of the Peace. He remained in trade about two years, and was at that time an important citizen. His daughter, Adeline, was married to Mr. Lewis Herring about 1856, it must have been in the fall of that year."], [469, "SHELDON TOWNSHIP. 455 to 1869, when, selling his property he went to Da kota and still remains there. It is said that he penetrated the earth to the extent of 140 feet, without reaching water. In the early days of Sheldon it had greater preten sions than it now has. One of its old-time pro prietors, and from whom it derived its name, Mr. Julius C. Sheldon, formerly a resident of Suffield, Connecticut, had great anticipations of the future growth of the town, and through his enterprise, together with other old-timers, the town made wonderful progress, and bid fair to rival any town in the southern part of the State. Certain causes, however, put a check to its progress, the construc tion of the Southern Minnesota railroad, six miles or so away, with the warning bell of the locomo tive, proved to be the curfew that toded the hour to extinguish its light, as it has many another promising village, to cause others, however, to ap pear in unexpected places, and thus to fulfill the law of compensation. POLITICAL HISTORY. The town of Sheldon was organized on the 11th of May, 1858. The town meeting was held in the village of Sheldon, and the following officers were elected: Supervisors, John Brown, Chairman, Steiner Knudson, and Henry Olson; Town Clerk, James Patton; Assessor, Michael Ryan; Codector, Lawrence Lynch; Justices of the Peace, Lyman B. Jefferson and Ch. Fetsan: Constable, Bartholo mew Henry; Overseer of the Poor, John Paddock. The present officers are: Supervisors, J. Schnei der, Chairman, Edward Crotty, and Ben. Benson; Clerk, W. H. Murphy; Treasurer, J. B. Wdliams; Assessor, T. O. Findreng. The trade of the town having been diverted to other points, the limpid waters of Beaver Creek, its splendid water-power, and the beautiful town site of Sheldon, lost their magnetic power, and it has since philosophically settled down, perfectly contented with being a quiet and comfortable farmer's town. VILLAGE OF SHELDON. Sheldon is beautifully ensemced in the valley of Beaver Creek, surrounded by high bluffs on either side,and is built on a broad bench of land run ning back from the creek,u pon which it is situated, to the extent of a mile in width, generally level, though sufficiently undulating to increase the beauty of the place without subjecting it to any heavy grading. This bench contains some 600 or 700 acres, and, though surrounded by bluffs, the entrances, to it from the various roads which connect it with other towns, and an excellent farm ing country, are generady most picturesque and beautiful, at the same time rendering it easily ac cessible, when the roads are kept in proper condi tion, from almost any other point in the county. Beaver Creek furnishes one of the most copious water-powers in the West; it is formed from large springs and has a western and southern branch which unite and form a single stream at a distance of a mde from the town. Either of these branches is amply sufficient for supplying water for first class mills of any description, and their banks are wed situated for the required buildings. The stream varies in width from twenty to twenty-five feet, has a depth of eighteen inches, and empties into the South Fork of Root Biver about two miles distant from the confluence of its two branches. It has a fall of about two feet to the mde, and is fided with fine trout, affording end less sport to the angler, besides supplying the table with a luxury ever envied by the epicure. The village, as laid out, had sixteen blocks, with eight lots in each, and cross adeys. The east and west streets, beginning on the north, are North Street, Foss Street, Broadway, which has a plaza in the center, Suffield, and South Streets. The streets at right angles with these, commencing on the west, are Mound, Wad, Main, Otter, and Beaver. The Caledonia road comes in on the southeast angle of the vdlage, and leaves it for Houston through Broadway. The village is in the valley, nestling between the hdls on the left bank of the stream that finds its way into the South Fork of Root River, in section eighteen. RELIGIOUS. Houston Society of the Norwegian Evangel ical Lutheran Church. \u2014 Not unlike almost ad other new settlements, occasional religious services were held at various places, mostly in the primi tive private residences about this region. The first remembered being at the houses of J. M. Matson and Andrew Michaelson about the year 1855. One of the early preachers was the Rev. B. Koren, from Looking Glass prairie, who is now a Bishop and stid residing there. Not long after this, the above mentioned society was formed in connection with like societies at Highland prairie and Rush ord, and they connectedly employed"], [470, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 456 Rev. N. E. Jenson, who thus became the first pas tor. The society was made up of about sixty fam ilies. The earliest trustees were: Christof Even son, Steiner Knudson, Seigurd Anderson, and Ole Ornott; T. A. Grover was the Clerk, and C. Even son the Treasurer, the latter serving about eleven years. The first services after Rev. Jenson was installed as pastor, were held in a blacksmith shop in Houston, and afterwards in private houses, but finally the erection of a church was begun in 1865, and completed the succeeding year. It is situated on the line between Houston and Shel don on the Houston and Caledonia valley road. The structure is of stone, except the porch, and is surmounted with a bed-tower and spire of wood. In size it is 60x35 feet, and the cost was $5,500. The bed cost $500, but in 1880, it was unfortu nately broken, and has not yet been repaired or replaced. years, officiating at the same time in Yucatan and Houston. The last regular pastor was Rev. J. Westervelt, who lived in Caledonia. Since 1879, there has been no service, except in the case of a funeral. Deaths and removals have so depleted the ranks that, to use a military term, hardly a corporal's guard could now be mustered, even for an emergency. SCHOOLS. District No. 23. \u2014 This was formerly No. 31, and is located in the Badger Valley, as it is called. The first English school taught here was in 1856 or '57, by Wm. H.

District No. 26. \u2014 This is the vidage school, and there is a good schoolhouse. District No. 22. \u2014 The location of this school house is on section nineteen near the north hne. The Rev. N. E. Jenson remained at his post untd 1870, when he was succeeded by Rev. Kr. Magelssen, who faithfully gave spiritual encour agement to the church for three years, and when he left, the society bestowed upon him a valuable testimonial as a token of their appreciation of his services. The ministrations are now by Rev. E. Jaastad, who resides in Rushford. District No. 25. \u2014 This building is on section thirty-four. biographical. George Brenneman, one of the pioneers of Sheldon, is a native of Clarion county, Pennsylva nia, where his birth occurred on the 11th of June, 1825. His father was a farmer and inn-keeper, and George remained at home untd the age of twenty-four years when he was married to Miss Ebeline Campbell. He was then for several years engaged in building freight boats on the Clarion River, aud also did some freighting. In 1857, they came to Sheldon, and Mr. Brenneman pur chased the house in which he now resides. Until 1875, he was engaged in mercantile pursuits, since which time he has given his attention to agriculture. Mrs. Brenneman died in 1873. She was the mother of seven children; Amanda, Mary Ann, John Henry, Jane, Margaret, Barbara Eliza beth, and David Clinton. Mr. Brenneman subse quently married a lady whose maiden name was Miss Hannah Gordon, also a native of Clarion county. An infant son is the result of this union. Mr. Brenneman has held a number of local offices, such as Justice of the Peace, Town Clerk, Con stable, etc. Methodist Episcopal. \u2014 In 1858, there were a sufficient number of adherents to this sect to form a society, and an organization was effected, which flourished for a time, and got together fifty mem bers. But neglecting the opportunities which that flood tide presented, the ebb which followed left the society stranded on the shore. While the society formed a part of a circuit and had a regular supply, various clergymen attended to its spiritual necessities, among them are re membered, Rev. Mr. White, Rev. Mr. Taintor, Rev. Mr. Quigley, Rev. James Condon, and Rev. Mr. Klepper, who was the last of the list. No church budding was ever erected, and the meetings were held in the most available places that could be procured. Presbyterian. \u2014 Not long after the Methodist denomination had assumed form, the Presbyterians also organized a society, and succeeded in budd ing a neat frame chapel 30x40 feet, in 1860. Rev.

His mother died when he was quite small, and in 1844, his father removed to Rock Island, Blinois, and thence to Henry county, in the same State. When seventeen years old, on account of the frigidity of the breath of his step-mother, he set out to seek his fortune. He arrived at Grand Rapids, Wiscon sin, without a cent of money, but soon found em ployment in rafting lumber down the Wisconsin and Mississippi Rivers, continuing in that occu pation during summer and attending school in winter for three years. He came to Houston county in 1852, and lived with his brother about three years. Having saved upwards of $300,he con cluded to open a store in the little hamlet of Shel don. With a line of endorsement from Sam. McPhail he went to Galena, purchased a stock of goods, and in May,1857,opened the first dry goods store in the place. In 1858, he was married to Miss L. E. Gardner. When the war of the rebellion be gan J,o assume serious proportions, he sold his stock of goods intending to enlist in the defense of his country, but was not accepted, on account of disability. In 1868, he purchased another budding and again engaged in trade here. Mr. Williams' store now consists of three buildings ar ranged side by side, in which he does a heavy country trade. He has four children ; Orpha, now Mrs. J. M. Knox, Mary, Rose, and Jane. During the last eighteen years Mr. Widiams has tided the offices of Town Clerk and Treasurer most of the time. Edgar E. Webster is a native of Wisconsin, born in the town of De Pere, on the 28th of March, 1845. On the 22d of February, 1864, he enlisted in Company F, of the Fourteenth Wisconsin Vol unteer Infanty, serving under Sherman at Vicks burg, Black River, and Clifton ; was in the cam paign against Hood, and afterward spent a month on patrol duty at Mobile. On the 26th of Octo ber, 1865, he was discharged, and returning to his native State entered the Ripon College, remaining five terms. He then, in January, 1869, came to Rushford, Minnesota, where he was married to Miss Lucy M. Lake, on the 4th of November, 1873. She has borne him three chddren. In 1876, they removed to Sheldon, and purchased the farm on which they now reside. He is at present filling the office of Justice of the Peace. Frederick Pieper was bom in Prussia, on the 8th of July, 1837. He entered the army at the age of twenty and served three years; then came to Canada West, in 1863, and in 1866, to Houston county. He was employed by farmers for a time, then rented some land in Union, and in 1881, re moved to Sheldon. He was united in marriage with Miss Frederike Weideman, on the 2d of No vember, 1862.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION FIRST SETTLEMENT FIRST MILL FIRST BIRTH AND DEATH FIRST MARRIAGE THE STAPLE PRODUCTS \u2014 POLITICAL ORGANIZA TION FIRST ELECTIONS SCHOOLS. This town is identical with a government town ship, and hes in the extreme southwestern corner of the county. The views obtained from different points are re markably fine. Looking northward nearly the whole of Black Hammer township is spread out like a panorama, to the west of which Fdlmore county territory can be seen. Directly west is a depression, with an elevation far beyond. The prospect looking south is only interrupted by the highlands beyond the Iowa River, and which ever way you turn, there is hill and vale, prairie and woodland, with dwellings dotting the landscape, and an occasional spire above the intervening groves pointing to the blue vault above. Black Hammer is on the north, Wilmington on the east, the state of Iowa on the south, and Fill more county on the western border. It has two vidages,^Riceford, on Riceford Creek, in section six, and Spring Grove, on the Narrow Gauge radroad, in section eleven. The town is wed settled with a thriving population. It was known at first as Norwegian Ridge, that is the whole elevated region which extends over into what is now Wilmington. The town when first organized was much larger than it is now, taking in a part of what has since been organized into Black Hammer. It has an area of about 23,000 acres. The only stream of any importance in the township is Riceford Creek, which courses along the western border of the town near the county line, running north, to finally unite with Root River. This town, taken in con nection with its neighbor, Wilmington, has some special geological features worthy of notice. Most of the other townships in the county are gorged with deep vadeys and ravines, cut in alternating strata of sandstone and limestone, below the gen eral level of the country; but here, the prevailing features in the county are reversed, as a connect ing series of elevated ridges forming broad up lands rear their water sheds nearly 200 feet above the surrounding prairie country. One common ridge a mde or more in width extends in a diago nal direction from the southwestern part of Spring Grove to the the northern part of Wdmington. This region is called the hdl country, and em braces ten miles or so from east to west, and six or seven from north to south. The surface drainage is in all directions, and the top of the water shed is remarkably level and carries the radroad bed with little grading. The slope either way is quite gradual, and what may be deemed remarkable the whole region is overspread with a rich clay loam, and being mostly open country is occupied by numerous farms, some of them on an extended scale. The dwedings are usually in sheltered nooks among the groves or below the brow of a protecting declivity. The village of Spring Grove is quite pleasantly situated on a high part of the main ridge, on nearly level ground, on the southern part of the water shed. The buildings are set wed apart and are neat and substantial, but a more complete des cription wdl be given of its characteristics in suc ceeding pages."], [475, "SPRING GROVE TOWNSHIP. 461 Along the table lands the early settlers found beautiful groves of oak, without underbrush, in terspersed with maple and black walnut, and in the shady aisles of these overhanging boughs, clear and sparkling springs bubbled up in the most in viting places, urging the seeker after a home to make this spot his abiding place. Most of the timber is now gone, but enough remains to give a good idea of the delightful prospect that greeted the early explorers. land, and to do other work on his claim, which consisted of 320 acres on section eleven. After his marriage to Miss Elizabeth Landrum, of Illi nois, a Sunday school was started at his house, and maintained for some time. Mr. Smith also secured the estabdshment of the Post-office, giving the place the appropriate name of Spring Grove, which it still retains. His house was the first stopping place in town. At an early date he re ceived the appointment of Justice of the Peace, and was a member of the County Commissioner's Court while Minnesota was still a Territory. The soil is of a clayey nature, merging into dark rich loam in the lowlands, but somewhat lighter along the bluffs, which are well adapted to grazing. In the southern part of the town, toward the west, the numerous springs form rivulets go ing south, to finally reach the Upper Iowa River, in the state of Iowa. Arthur B. Bow, a native of Vermont, appeared upon the scene perhaps e\"ven before Smith, and had a little shanty and staked out large tracts of land of the most desirable quality, and on the finest locations, with a view of selling to some un sophisticated seeker after a home, who might have some money. After Smith had put up his cabin, Bow put up one just west of it, and lived on it some time, making a certain amount of improve ments, which were finady purchased by Embrick Knudson, and Bow went further west. An abundance of lime stone is found along the ridges cropping out at convenient points, and an occasional kiln is burned with satisfactory results, although on account of the want of a steady mar ket this is in no respect an organized industry. This lime rock also furnishes most excellent budd ing material and is extensively used for this pur pose, and the demand in this direction must be ever increasing. Mr. Knudson lived on the land untd 1863, when he also moved on with the western tide of emigration. He was a native of Norway, and came to America in 1846; first located in South ern Wisconsin, and afterwards in Pine Creek, Iowa, from whence he came to Spring Grove in about 1854. He was a prominent man, and assisted in the organization of the town; was for several years Postmaster and Town Treasurer, and is well remembered by the old settlers. He at first went to Fidmore county, and afterwards to North Fork, Steams county, where he died in the spring of 1880. His widow and children stid hve in the latter county, except a daughter, who, as Mrs. Nels Barsen, resides in Fillmore county. The town is well adapted to agricultural pur suits, and has a large cultivated area, yielding good crops of the cereals and other products of the latitude; and in the low lands, hay is a most val uable crop. Fruit culture is more or less success ful. This soil and climate is remarkably wed adapted to the cultivation of the amber cane, and considerable attention has been paid to this crop, some of the farmers making syrup to the amount of eight or nine hundred gallons in one season. This industry being new to most of the settlers, attention to it is of slow growth, but this very slowness ensures its permanency, and with the large and ever increasing demand for \"sweetening,\" this must in due time be one of the largest crops raised here. In the winter of 1851-52, John Vale, who lived in Iowa, came over, and like Queen Dido at Car thage, run a line around immense tracts of choice land, cut and spdt some rails, and the following spring or summer, 1852, he sold his rails and pre emption rights, whatever they were, to H. Narve son, Knud Knudson Kieland, and Fingal Asleson, whose famdies now reside on the places thus se cured. THE PRIMARY SETTLEMENT. The first actual settler, who located a claim and erected a dwelling, was James Smith, now an esteemed resident of Caledonia. He came from Pennsylvania, being unmarried at the time, and for several years did his own housework. He ar rived in the spring of 1852, but went to Lansing, Iowa, in the fall to work at his trade, that of print ing; he returned in the spring to break up his Anthony Huyck, who had a place in Caledonia, came here soon after Mr. Smith, and put his signet on some edgible acres, and as he had ox teams, he was capable of making improvements of value, and"], [476, "462 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. Timanson, Gilbert Nielson, Myrha and Hans Nielson, Ole C. Steneroder and several others. The presence of these men in such a force gave the locality the name of \"Norwegian Ridge,\" and on the organization of the county it became the name of the voting precinct, and by that name people at a distance stid designate this region. avading himself of his facihties, of course realized on his investment. During the summer of 1852, the settlement of the town was rapid. The long dnes of emigrants moving by the front towards the frontier with its uncertain boundary, and as a section reached this spot, it would instinctively halt, and if the re sult of the reconnoissance revealed an unoccupied spot, or a purchasable one with the means at com mand, the resolution would be made to go no further, but to locate right here. And so at this early day, Spring Grove sprung into existence as an important settlement. In this connection Ole Oleson should not be for gotten, who, from his extraordinry size, was known far and near as \"Big Ole.\" He remained here about one year when he removed to Iowa. In the southern part of the town a settlement was effected, also in 1852, by Ole O. Ulen on section twenty- six, where he made a home and remained ten or twelve years, and then, after spending some time in Iowa, finally moved to Clay county, this State. After coming from Norway, he had spent a single year in Wisconsin. John Anderson Kroshus also took a claim on section twenty-six the same season, the place now occupied by Em brick Hanson, to whose father it was sold in 1853. Ole Christophsrson located on sections thirty-four and thirty-five, where he still remains. First Scandinavian Settlers. \u2014 During the first summer, when this region was attracting so much attention, there was quite an immigration of enterprising young men and women from Norway. Prominent among these were the following men, many of whom with their children are among the leading business men, and the active citizerfs and politicians of the county : Peter Johnson Lommen, who located on section three, and has since made it his home. Knud Ol son Bergo, on section ten, but who has since died, and his family removed. Even Evenson Haime, who located on section nine, where he remained until October 14, 1873, when he died. His widow and children still live on the same place. These three men came the same week in June, 1852. H. Narveson located on the eastern part of section ten , where he lived untd his death, and the family still occupies the farm. Fingal Asleson and Knud Knudson bought land together with Mr. Narveson, making his shanty their home for a while, but soon divided their land, and the two former have since separately carried on their farms, still living on them. Ole and Tolef Amundson Berg located on ection sixteen, where they have since lived and now have large and well improved farms. In July, 1852, Torger Johnson Tenneland located on section fifteen, where he lived until his death, on the 23d of 1 >ecember, 1873. His son now carries on the farm. These were the pi oneer Scandinavians of the town, and came direct from Wisconsin to the newly organized territory of Minnesota. These adventurers were followed by others who soon filled up this part of the township, which is denominated \"the valley,\" in which may be found some of the finest cultivated farms in the town or county. In the southwestern part of the town, which is mostly prairie, and lies south and east of Rice ford Creek, a large portion was originally bought at the early land sale by speculators, and it was later in being colonized than the eastern or north ern portion, and was mostly settled by Ameri cans. The first man to put in an appearance in this place was Mr. W. Banning, who built a grist-mill on the creek in section nineteen, in the fall of 1852. This mill was the first in this whole region, and it filled the untutored mind of the red man, whose squaws brought their corn to be ground, with wonder and admiration. The mill was a primi tive affair, although it revealed the struggling ef forts of genius in its construction. The old settlers who saw this mill, and used to wait so many long and tedious hours for the half bushel of corn they had toted on their shoulders such a weary way, to finally be handed back in the form of meal, never tire of relating incidents as to this wonderful affair. During the remainder of that year, and for a year or so afterwards, many others of the same nationality came and took an active part in the development of the town; among these may be mentioned Gudbrand M. Rund, Levor and George At first it was a mere corn cracker, but after a"], [477, "si' RING GROVE TOWNSHIP. 463 whde the stones got a little nearer together and the product was dignified by the name of meal. A complete description of the mill would baffle a pa tent right lawyer. But a general idea wid be at tempted. mill with the identical stones, and have it on ex hibition to illustrate the contrast between \"now\" and \"then.\" The stones of this old mid are now in possession of Mr. V. T. Beeby, at Riceford; they measure twenty-six inches in diameter. The site of the mid is now occupied by Mr. E. Nelson. In 1853, Mr. W. H. Rowe was prospecting in this section and bought this property from Mr. Ban ning. This was on the 27th of June. There was considerable land with it that Mr. Banning had staked off. Mr. Rowe improved the mdl and fixed a bolting box, to be revolved by hand, so that he had a flouring-mdl. He also rigged up a saw for his own use. A dam was thrown across the river, and a head thus obtained. Below the dam was a box to re ceive a wheel with a vertical shaft ; the wheel hav ing buckets radiating like the spokes of a wagon wheel, placed at the bottom. The water was ad mitted on one side, and following the wheel three quarters round would make its escape. It was a wooden affair and the crudest kind of a turbine wheel, with no attempt at confining the water and securing the reaction as is now done. The run ning stone was connected directly with the wheel shaft, the stones rested on a strong hardwood frame, and literally stood out of doors, with no covering except in case of a rain, when a few boards would be called into requisition to cover the hop per. The great trouble in the whole business was to feed it slow enough for its capacity. It is said a whole handful of corn inadvertently dropped in at once would bring everything up standing. The early settlers,although at that day surround ed with a halo of romance into which freedom and an absence of conventional restraint, which left them chddren of nature, largely entered, never theless had a hard time generally. The luxuries of life were wholly denied them, the comforts everywhere considered indispensible were rare, and actual necessities were only attainable under the greatest difficulties, particularly in the winter, when most of the settlers in this region had to go to Turkey River, in Iowa, to mill; later, a mill was built near Dorchester, but that was still quite a journey. Among the numerous other yarns told at the expense of this of this mill, is of a man who, hav ing seen his grist deposited in the hopper, went round below to see the meal come through and after waiting a reasonable time and there was no \"giving down,\" an investigation was made, when a mouse was discovered catching up each kernel as it appeared, and biting out the eye would then throw the rest away. This intruder being driven off, the man in due time got his grist through. As an instance of the work and hardship requir ed to keep soul and body together, it is said, Knud Olson Bergo took what he could comfortably car ry on his back in a sack and started for the mill below Dorchester, and it was more than a week before he succeeded in getting home. The deep snows and cold weather prevented many from go ing to mdl at all. The little mill spoken of above would at such times be immovably frozen up, and so they had to grind their corn in a coffee mill or pound it up in a mortar. This was indeed the day of small things, and a comparison between this mill and one of Wash burn's, or Pillsbury's, at Minneapolis, would dis count the fable of the molehill and the mountain. The first birth was a daughter of Tolef Amund son Bergh, Mary J., who was born October 29, 1852. She died on the 29th of November of the same year. The burial was on the farm about three miles west of the village. But after all, the efforts of Mr. Banning are not to be despised. Consider the obstacles he had to overcome, think of the long distance over a bridge less and a roadless country he had to convey these stones and the tools and material required for his undertaking, which, under the circumstan ces, was a most formidable one. Probably the oldest living, chdd born in Spring Grove is John P. Lommen, who was born on the 12th of December, 1852. He is now a merchant in Caledonia, and is a son of Peter Johnson Lom men, a prominent citizen of Spring Grove. How many to-day would thus start out, and go west beyond the confines of the present civilization, and thus build a mill without means as he prac tically was, not having enough funds to keep a man a week at a fashionable hotel. Some of our modern millers should procure a model of this The first marriage was, as near as can be re membered, that of Hans Nielson Myhra and Miss Mary B. Anderson, in February, 1854. Mr."], [478, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 464 lished; one at New House, already mentioned, and one at the village of Spring Grove, of which men tion is reserved for another chapter. By referring to the annual report, the immense benefit arising from this enterprise wdl readily be percieved. Farmers are no longer subject to the tedious jour ney before necessary, in marketing their yearly increasing produce, and merchants are no less for tunate in the present ample facidties for transpor tation. Myrha is dead, but his widow is still living in Caledonia. During the years 1854-55, quite a number of families were added to the already thriving col ony, and the few years immediately succeeding witnessed still further dev elopments. Farms were opened iu all parts of the town, and the early com ers were beginning to reap some of the rewards for their self-sacrificing toil. Larger buildings were erected, schools and churches established, and a general air of thrift and enterprise began to be visible, where so recently ad was wild and un inhabited, except by the wild beasts of the forest and prahie. The railroad, a sketch of which is given in the general history of the county, passes through the township from the northeast corner, following the ridge already described, and crossing the west boundary north of the southwest corner. At an early day the farmers turned their atten tion to the cultivation of wheat, and at first the yield was beyond their expectations, being sometimes from twenty to thirty bushels to the acre, but various untoward circumstances, atmos pheric and other causes,produced frequent failures, the crop getting down sometimes to ten bushels or less per acre. From the crude and experimen tal efforts of earlier years, has been developed more systematic methods of farming, and the beneficial effects are already quite apparent. Corn and its remunerative product, pork, is largely raised, and although there is exceptionally some mortality among the hogs, the crop is more certain as a standard production, and at fair prices, now that there is direct railroad communication with Chicago and Milwaukee, the great pork packing centers, than any other that has been attempted, and the only thing that may supercede it in the near fu ture is the butter and cheese business, to which the town is well adapted, as there seems to be some inclination in -that direction. POLITICAL ORGANIZATION. The town of Spring Grove was organized the same year that the State was admitted into the Union, 1858, but unfortunately the records have not been preserved. The following letter from one of the early set tlers in relation to the town organization wdl be read with interest: Decorah, Iowa, December 27th, 1881. Dear Sir: At the first election in Spring Grove, after the State was admitted, Mr. W. T. Hinkley, Mr. B. S. Andrews, and myself were each candidates for Justice of the Peace and Andrews and I were elected. I believe C. H. Brown and also W. T. Hinkley ran for the Chairmanship of the Board of Supervisors, and that Brown was chosen for both of the positions, Chairman and Superintendent, but I am not quite sure. I know that Hinkley was Town Clerk, and he must have been elected at this first election. For many years the citizens of this town labored under the disadvantage of being so far removed from market as to render farming or other indus tries less profitable than in more favored localities, and when the Chicago, Clinton, Dubuque, and Minnesota Railroad Company made the prelimi naiy survey, and submitted a proposition to build a narrow gauge line if the requisite encourage ment was extended, the town voted a bonus of twelve thousand dodars, payable within twenty years, the bonds to bear interest at the rate of seven per cent., the towa to elect when, within the specified time, the payment should be made. Under the conditions of the contract between the company and the town, two stations were estab- I think the other supervisors were John Nelson and George Timanson, but am not positive. I be lieve Embrick Knudson was Town Treasurer. It is likely that C. H. Brown, of Riceford, would re member about it. On further reflection, I am sure that Brown was elected Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, and Hinkley, Town Clerk. For at any rate they were acting in that capacity at the time of the next town meeting. I am pretty sure the other super visors were Nelson and Timanson. Francis Aiken was one Constable, but I don't remember the other. My first vote was cast at Spring Grove, in the spring of 1855, on the question of removing the"], [479, "SPRING GROVE TOWNSHIP. 465 County Seat.

He bought about a half bushel of eggs and boiled them, and we all had a The present town officers are: Supervisors, A. Lamb, Chairman, Embrick Hanson, and A. ' M. Hallan; Clerk, Nels O. Ongard; Assessor, L. T. Johnson; Treasurer, Charles Hoegh, and Justices of the Peace, A. Halverson and V. T. Beeby. The town meetings are now held in the Town Hall, which was the old school house, bought by the town when the new one was built in 1872. free lunch and lots of fun. Jame3 Smith, of Caledonia, was among the first settlers in Spring Grove, which at first went by the name of \"Norwegian Ridge.\" Yours truly, S. Aiken. There is, of course, no reason to doubt the cor- rectness of this statement. At the early precinct and town meetings, what may be characterized as \"high old times\" were had. The place could not then have been called a tem- perance town, and at all the public meetings a good time was always expected and usuady ob- tained, unless the demijohns ran dry, and such a contingency was provided against with tender cire. The usual results of such inspiration natu- rally followed, and free fights in the true Donny- brook Fair variety, were not unf requent. At the \"county seat\" election, which took place iu Smith's Grove, just east of the present village, the whole town came out, and as Cale Ionia was the ambi- tious burgh that was struggliug for the honor, Samuel McPhail, the original proprietor of the village plat, was on hand at this the most thickly settled place hereabouts, and as mentioned by Mr. Aiken, he furnished eggs which were boiled in kettles on the ground, and he also had butter to eat on them, which was- more or less a novelty at even the regular m.als at that time. If there was any doubt as to which way the question would be decided, the butter and eggs settled it. It was the most exciting election ever held in town. The owners of real estate in Brownsville, Caledonia, and Houston, were frantically anxious; each could see visions of wealth ready to be poured into his lap, and all depending upon the decision of the hour. The question \"To be,\" or \"Not to be,\" was the vital one with them, whether they were to be remanded to an equal struggle with the world, or were to bj reinforced by the voice of the county transforming their farms into city lots. SCHOOLS. District No. 55.\u2014 A Norwegian school was commenced in a very primitive way at an early period of the history of the colony. At first the school was peripatetic, being kept a single week in one house, and the next in another, the school actually boarding around instead of the teacher, as sometimes happened in those primitive times. Cornelius Narveson was the teacher who faith- fully followed the scholars in their pilgrimage in quest of the keys of knowledge. Since its organiz- ation the boundary of the district has been modi- fied to some extent. After the outline was defined tlie local habitation secured was in the house of Ole Amundson Berg on section sixteen, and after- ward room was rented from John Myhro on sec- tion eight. The school was held in various places, until a small frame buildiug was constructed on section eight; this must have been about 1867, al though there is a wide difference in the recodec- tion of the citizens as to the exact time. After- wards the original structure was doubled in size, and it is now a respectable appearing school house. District No. 56. \u2014 The first school was held in an old log house of Abner Aiken, on section thirty, which had been his residence; the school contin ued there for some time, but was not very popular. In 1866, the present comfortable house was put up, on the west line of section twenty-nine, at a cost of about $800.00. There are now from fifty to seventy-five pupils on the roll. The school is kept up from six to eight months each year. The feelings and movements of McPhail as he joyfully flew to carry the glad news to the Cale donians, were in striking contrast with the depres sing sensations experienced by the pilgrims from the other contesting points, as they sadly and si lently climbed the intervening bluffs, to carry the disappointing tidings to their expectant friends at home. Thj citizens who participated in that con- District No. 57. \u2014 This was organized in the spring of 1857, and the first officers were, Andrew Hanson, Clerk; Hans. P. Rosendahl, Treasurer; and Teman Gilbertson, Director. The first funds were raised by subscription, and Ole Ulen and Andrew P. Kroshus cut and had sawed the timber for the erection of the first school house, which was ready for occupancy in the fall of 1857. Mil"], [480, "466 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. This building was 14x18 feet, and was constructed by Embrick Olson and Gilbert N. Myrha. the eastern part of section eleven, just east of the present village. In 1855, or thereabouts, Mr. Smith sold his stock of goods to Mr. Wm. Hinkley, who commenced the erection of a store about a half mile west of Smith's place, and soon moved in a stock of goods. The land he bought of Embrick Knudson. Miss Mahala E. Rowe taught the first school in the house in the summer of 1858, and as a prom inent connecting link between the past and the present, it should be stated that a son of the first teacher, Mr. Addison, taught the last school in the house, in the winter of 1880; and then the old building went the way of all the world. The present structure was put together a half -mile east of the old one near the southeast corner of section twenty -six. The old budding still remains and is used by Teman Gilbertson as a store room. In addition to groceries and general merchandise, Mr. Hinkley was a dealer in wines and liquors, which in those primitive days meant \"whiskey straight.\" His supply in this line was kept in a little addition to the store, in which he slept, and the weary traveler passing the store any time in the night would gently tap on the window, pass in his bottle or jug with the \"equivalent,\" and Hinkley would fill it without getting out of bed, and hand it back to the grateful customer. After a while Mr. Hinkley removed to Riceford. District No. 76. On the 24th of April, 1869, a regular meeting was held for the purpose of or ganizing a school district from territory taken from No. 57. The meeting was at the house of John Erickson, and the following year the house mw there, was erected at a cost of about $700.00, and in 1870, the excercises of the school began, Miss Ella M. Dibble wielding the ferule as an em blem of her authority. About this time Mr. William Fleming bought forty acres of land of Embrick Benson, paying him $100 for it, which was one hundred per cent. above the government price. This particular forty is the land on which most of the village now stands. District No. 88. \u2014 This district was dissected out of No. 57, which seems to have been the moth er of districts, in 1878. The first school was held at the residence of Knud Gilbertson on section twenty-three, in the winter or late fall of 1878. In the summer of 1879, the very pretty schoolhouse now used was erected on section twenty-four, on the farm of Knud Gilbertson. Mr. Fleming was a noted character in his way, keenly appreciating practical jokes and stories. He erected a large log budding, his neighbors all turning out to assist, and making the occasion a holiday, and this house became a famous one in its day. It was the half-way house on the road to Brownsville, and a general stopping place where dances and parties were gathered. The house was always full, and it required considerable skill to stow away the extra guests always arriving. Men used to be required to sleep across the foot of the bed where there were two or three pointing in the other direction. At one time there were several gentlemen from St. Paul, and to make a bed wide enough to hold them, an annex to a bed was made up of a row of chairs in front, and as they proved to be too low, a lot of pumpkins were placed on them and they were thus brought up to the grade. After these men left they caded it the \"Pumpkin Tavern,\" and so Fleming took the hint, and he used to take a pumpkin and making a jack-o-lan tern of it, place a candle inside and put it on a pole in front of his house as a sign, and of course no one could resist the temptation in those days to call in and take a drink. For many years it was VILLAGE OF SPRING GROVE. The first steps leading to the founding and subsequent development of this thriving village have already been mentioned, as have also the names of the principal actors. It required no prophetic vision to foresee the ul timate concentration of capital and energy which has placed this naturally favored spot among the brightest and most prosperous of inland towns, and given to the surrounding country a trading point excelled by none in southern Minnesota. When the settlement of the region west of this led to the founding of the village of Preston, in Fill more county, this became a half-way station be tween that place and Brownsville, where the Land Office was then located. Mr. Smith's house then became a popular stopping place for travelers, and tor some time was the only one at this point. EARLY BEGINNINGS. Mr. Smith's house and store, which was not large, was situated on the old Brownsvide road, on"], [481, "SPRING GROVE TOWNSHIP. 467 known far and near as the \"Pumpkin Tavern,\" and Mr. Fleming conducted it until his death long years ago, and it is said that his burial was the first adult American in town. of the place, shields it from the cold northern blasts of winter. RELIGIOUS. The first religious service in town must have been as early as the fall of 1852 or '53, for the Norwegians who located here were a church-goino and pious people, and their first efforts, after se curing a place for a home, was to secure religious instruction, and at the time mentioned, a meeting, unquestionably the first in town, was held at the house of Mr. Even Evenson Haime, on section nine. The Rev. N. Brandt was the officiating clergyman. He came from Wisconsin, and has since been a professor in an Iowa college. Per haps it was the next year when a clergyman from Washington Prairie, the Rev. V. Koren, held meetings at the house of G. Timanson, on section fifteen. It must have been in the spring of 1854, when a Sunday school was organized at the house of James Smith, whose wife was the inspiration of the whole movement, and took a leading part in the school, whicli was sometimes held at the house of O. Christianson Steneroder, on section twelve. Mr. Ralph L. Young, who had been among the Mormons, sometimes preached here. About that time a number of books were bought and quite a library was started, and many of the Norwegians eagerly took out books in the vain hope of soon being able to read English, but the interest in the library soon waned, and it was abandoned. After some time Mr. Smith had his farm platted and laid out as a vdlage site, but it was never so occupied and was finally sold to Mr. Robert Mc- Cormick, who kept a public house. The next notable move here was the erec tion of a building for a saloon by Nick and Jesse Demering, of Caledonia, near the Fleming house, but it was soon abandoned as a saloon, and in 1857, Mr. Badger, of Madison, Wisconsin, put in a large and choice stock of general merchandise. This building was on the present site of Mons. Fladager's old store. The business went on for a few months only, when the building was myste riously burned, which was a serious loss, as the stock of goods was remarkably extensive for so new a country. Soon after this a firm by the name of Tartt & Smith came from Dorchester, Iowa, brought a stock of goods, and displayed them ill a building that is still standing in the east part of the section. After a few years they folded their tents, and silently returned from whence they came. The his toric forty already alluded to, had passed into the hands of Peter Halverson, now residing in the town of Wilmington, who sold it to Mons Fladager in 1860, in the month of February, when he came here and identified himself with the inter ests of the village and town. At first he occupied the old log building formerly used as a tavern by Fleming. In 1864, he erected a neat frame build ing on the site of the Badger place and occupied this until November, 1881, when,having completed a fine brick building, he removed his goods thereto. Mr. Fladager is one of the leading merchants in the village and the oldest trader; in fact the only families within the present village limits when he came, were those of Mr. Hinkley and Robert Mc- Cormick. The Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church. \u2014 The result of the various meetings held during the first years of the colony, and the anxiety of the people resulted in the organization of this church in 1856, the meeting for that pur pose being held in the^ouse of George Timan son. It was called \"The Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Congregation of Norwegian Ridge.\" The extent of this parish was largo, and included from beyond the Root River to beyond the Little Iowa. After the congregation had been regularly or ganized, a minister was sent for in the old country, and a memorandum in Rev. F. C. Clauson's own handwriting states that he \"entered upon his voy age for America on the 22d of August, 1857, to ac cept the position of minister of the gospel in the congregations of Norwegian Ridge, in Minnesota, and Big Canoe, Iowa.\" The location of the village is unexceptionally favorable, occupying level or gently sloping ground on the table before mentioned, supplied with an abundance of lime rock and brick clay for building purposes, while the rich agricultural country surrounding renders it one of the best points for trade in this portion of the State. A part of the original grove still remains on the north, which, besides adding to the natural beauty Mr. Clauson came directly here, arriving in the fall of that year, became the first resident pastor,"], [482, "468 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. and at once set himsed and the whole congrega tion at work to build up the cause in this new world. feet above the pavement. The belfry contains a bell weighing 707 pounds, which, although not large for such a church, is remarkably sweet toned, and from its altitude can be heard a great distance. This bell was procured for the old church in 1868. The chuich is remarkably well finished, and with its stained glass windows, re minds one of the church edifices so common in Europe. Mr. Clauson was born on Washington's birth day, 1810, and died on the 23d of October, 1870. so that his pastorate extended over a period of thirteen years. He was forty- seven years of age at the time of his entrance ujaon the work here, to which he devoted, with a rare skill and an untiring energy, the rest of his life. His loss was keenly felt, as he had secured the love, confidence, and esteem of the whole community. After his death, his family, a wife, one son, and a daughter, re moved to Iowa and made a visit to Norway, but the daughter died on their way back to America. Beneath the church proper is a spacious base ment, which has been prepared for a high school, and so used for several terms. It is also used one day in each week for religious instruction for the children, preparatory to confirmation, and it also serves for the business meetings of the con gregation. The church has a comfortable seating capacity of 950 persons. When the new church was completed the old one was demolished, and the stone sold to various parties for building pur poses. The year after the organization of the church, a log house was built, 18x26 feet, on a fifty acre lot furnished by Mr. G. Timanson, who turned it over to the Society at the original government price, and the next year, 1857, when Mr. Clauson came, it was occupied as a parsonage, whde the meetings were held in the old schoolhouse that is now the Town Hall. Adjoining the church on the north is a ceme tery, in which are seen scores of monuments, shafts and slabs of polished marble, standing as silent sentinels over this lifeless city, ever indica ting by their voiceless story the mortality of human life and the immortality of the soul, as in dicated by the remembrance of those who remain for those who have gone on before. In 1860, the foundation for a church was laid, Mr. Hans Nielson Myhra, one of the pioneers of the town, took a very active part in the construc tion of this edifice, and took the lead in locating and building it, doing most of the work and fur nishing nearly all of the material, afterwards get ting his pay in installments as the- congregation was able to discharge the debt. Mr. Nielson Myhra was a native of Norway, having first seen the light on the 12th of September, 1824, and coming to this town at an early day, took an ac tive part in all public enterprises. His death was on the 9th of February, 1867, and his remains rest in the cemetery near the new church. In 1862, the house was so far finished that meetings were held in it up to 1868, when it was finally comple ted. The building was of solid stone walls, 35x65 feet, and served until 1877, when the present church was completed, and dedicated to the ser vice of Almighty God on the 11th of July, 1877. During the year immediately following the death of the lamented Mr. Clauson, Rev. H. A- Stubb, Rev. T. Larson, and others held occasional services. This Rev. Mr. Larson was a very pious and learned man, and was greatly beloved. He died on the 27th of October, 1878, and his mortal remains lay beside those of Mr. Clauson in the churchyard. The Rev. Styrk S. Reque then came and took charge of the congregation as its pastor. Mr. Reque has done an immense amount of work since he has been here. Holding meetings at more or less regular intervals at various points in the vicinity. Since the starting of this, the mother church, many other Lutheran congrega tions have been formed. Those in this county are mentioned in the history of the towns where they are located. This beautiful temple, the pride of the village and surrounding country, is of brick manufactured within a tew rods of its location, and rests upon a heavy stone foundation, also taken from the quar ries near by. It is of gothic design, one hundred feet two inches, by forty -six feet eight inches, with wings projecting ten feet on either side, the whole surmounted by a beautiful spire with its top 145 Mr. Reque is assisted in his ministerial labors by Rev. E. P. Jensen, who resides about five miles from the village, and has separate charge of a con gregation in Newburg, Fillmore county. The church at Spring Grove numbers six hundred communicants, making, with the other societies"], [483, "SPRING GROVE TOWNSHIP. 469 under charge of the resident pastor, one thousand one hundred and seventy-five, as shown by the last annual report. Charles Hoegh, Secretary; and Rev. Styrk S. Reque, Janitor. This Society has been thus far for mutual benefit to its members, but it is 'yet in its infancy, and will, with the prospect now' before it, and judging by the character of the members, have a brilliant future; as it is in contemplation to have lectures, addresses, and essays, with dia logues, readings, and music, and whatever of an entertaining character may be suitable for healthy presentation to the public. At their annuarmeet ing on the 21st of November, 1881, the following list of officers were elected: I. Muder, Presi dent; Charles Hoegh, Vice-President ;rO.'Stener oder, Treasurer ; Rev. Styrk S. Reque, Secretary; and O. Stensrud, Janitor. The meetings of the Association are set for once a week. This church is one of the institutions of Spring Grove, and it has, and still exerts a powerful in fluence throughout the community. It has been particularly fortunate in its pastoral relations, and, judging by the past, its future is indeed most promising. CEMETERY. At an early day a burying place was selected on the farm of H. N. Narveson, which was on the southeast corner of section ten. Between forty and sixty were buried here, and at the time it was expected that the church would be built near it, but the persistent energy of those hving further east carried it on to section eleven. The old lot is now used as a cultivated field, and soon every vestige reminding one of a final resting place for human remains will be effectually oblit erated. Many of the present residents have the remains of departed friends deposited here. The first interment at this spot was Hans Ostensen Melbranter. POST-OFFICE. The Post-office was established in 1854, through the exertions of Mr. James Smith, who was ap pointed Postmaster, and the office was opened at his house, which was a tavern at that time. He continued to hold the place until about two years afterwards, when Embrick Knudson was ap pointed, and be removed the office to his house near the old Hinkley place. In 1861, Mr. Mons Fladager was appointed deputy, and kept it in his store for about a year, when Mr. Prentiss suc ceeded to the position and removed the office to his hotel, the old Hinkley store, \"and now on T. Gilbertson's place. Mr. Prentiss is now in La Crosse. The other cemetery is the church yard above alluded to, which, in obedience to the European tra dition, adjoins the church. NEWSPAPER. Spring Grove can boast of once having had a newspaper. In the spring of 1880, an enterpris ing young man named Sven H. Ellestad, started a small folio 10x24 inches and called it the \"Spring Grove Posten.\" He was editor, proprietor, pub lisher, and printer. Mr. Schmidt Nilson was in terested in its success, and contributed most of the editorial work to its columns. It had a local habitation in a small frame building back of T. T. Bergh's hardware store. His press was a small one and is said to have cost $180. The paper suc ceeded with great credit to itself in breasting a tempestous and unfeeling world for twelve months, when it gracefully yielded to one of the diseases of newspaper infancy, and passed away. After a time Dr. T. Jenson was commissioned Postmaster; he appointed J. C. Tartt as deputy, who took the office into his store in the east part of the village, near the old McCormick place. The office was kept in this way up to 1865, when Mr. Nels Olson Onsgard was commissioned, and is still Postmaster. THE VILLAGE SCHOOL. This is in District No. 54 of the county system. In the early times here a Norwegian school was started in the houses of the colonists of that na tionality, and in 1857, a frame school house was built, about 18x24 feet, costing from $350 to $400, and a school was kept in it for part of each year, ranging from two to six months. Mr. Mc- Donald was the first teacher. Sometimes the teach in\" was English, and sometimes Norwegian. At first this building was a general meeting house. LITERARY SOCIETY. In 1880, an association was organized in the basement of the church with the euphonic name of \"Fremad\" which indicates progress, onward, or excelsior. The following officers were elected : J. Paulson, President; O. Henderson, Treasurer;"], [484, "470 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. It stdl stands and has been already alluded to as the Town Hall. mick & Co., with a capacity of about 8,000 bush els, and it has been in operation ever since. In 1872, the present school building was erected at a cost of about $1,800. It is two stories, and 30x40 feet. At present two departments are main tained during five months in the year in the Eng lish language, and one department four months in the Norwegian language. HOTELS. Teman Gilbertson, the well known and genial landlord of the principal hotel in the village, kept a public house at the old Hinkley building for several years, and in 1879, he erected his present large brick house, which is situated some distance from the depot, in the western part of the village. INDUSTRIES. Brickmaking. \u2014 Most excellent clay for brick making is found in various places in the town, and the large and elegant church in the village was constructed of bricks manufactured near by. The success of this venture stimulated Mr. J. Schneider to put in a kiln and commence the manufacture of brick. This yard has already turned out hundreds of thousands, which have been used for building purposes throughout this whole region, and particularly for the brick stores in the village. Charles Hoegh also accommodates the weary traveler at his residence in connection with his hardware store. RAILROAD TRAFFIC. On the 13th of October, 1879, the railroad had reached this point, and a station was opened for general business. The next year the line was pur chased by the Chicago, Milwaukee k St. Paul Rail road Company, who assumed full charge in Nov ember, 1880. The first and only agent here is Frank Bartholemew, a native of Vernon county, Wisconsin, who came here from Lansing, Iowa, where he had for three years been in the employ of the old company. To this obliging and effi cient officer we are indebted for interesting infor mation regarding the business done at this station. During the year 1880, the shipments here were nearly ten per cent, in excess of any other point on the line, the number of car loads of grain and stock amounting to five hundred and seventy-two. The total freight forwarded was six midion seven hundred and forty -eight thousand four hundred and thirty-four pounds, and the total freight re cieved, two mdlion nine hundred and nineteen thousand six hundred and eighty-nine pounds. Brewery. \u2014 About the year 1866, Mr. J. P. Murray budt on a twenty-two acre lot, which was a part of the old Embrick Knudson farm, and which he had purchased of Mr. Hinkley. He started the manufacture of beer and run the brew ery for several years, but the business finally col lapsed. The old building stid remains. Lumber Yards. \u2014 After the completion of the railroad, Day Brothers, of Decorah, Iowa, opened a lumber yard here. Previous to this time Browns ville, or some place in Iowa, got the lumber trade from this region. The first transaction on the Day Brothers' books was October 20, 1879. After about a year the firm sold out, and James Vincent & Son, soon after became the owners. They had started a like business a few weeks after Day Brothers, the first entry being November 13th, 1879. Some time in 1880, Mr. L. Budahl took charge of the business and has since managed it for the Vincents. A good stock of seasoned lum ber is kept on hand. The village is now one of the most thrifty in the Northwest, having four general stores, two drug stores, two hotels, two restaurants, three blacksmith shops, hardware store, one church, one school, a harness shop, shoe shop, lumber yard, two elevators, a furniture shop, etc. A physician is also located here, Dr. T. Jenson. Grain Elevators. \u2014 The first elevator in town was built by the railroad company at the time of the completion of the radroad to this place. It was leased to A. & T. McMichaels, who began to receive grain on the 25th of October, 1879. The capacity of the building was at first about 10,000 bushels, but an addition was subsequently built adding 3,000 to this amount. The first year it handled 49,000 bushels; wheat, oats and barley. NEW HOUSE. This is the name of a little place on the line of the radroad, which is quite a shipping point for stock and other farm products. This station was established with the completion of the road in 1879, and a grain elevator built by the railroad company. A store was soon after opened by Johnson & Halverson, which, however, Another elevator, was soon built by McCor-"], [485, "SPRING GROVE TOWNSHIP. 471 was not long continued. Tollefson & Co., mer chants at the newly established station of Mabel, opened a branch store here, but soon withdrew to their principal trading place. stopping awhile in Michigan, came on to this region and spent a few weeks about three miles south of here, at the residence of W. H. Rowe, and then came to this place and planted himsed. The next year, 1855, he sold out to Job Brown, the original pioneer who seemed to have been on the alert for eligible points for town sites. It would seem from the character of the sur rounding country that one or more stores with gen eral merchandise here, would command a good trade, as it would certainly be a great convenience to the farmers in the vicinit/. There is a single store on the Iowa side of the line, which receives supplies from this depot. Among the first to be attracted to this then promising place were S. W. Wilcox, J. Shaw, Ed ward Coffee, J. Muns, Charles H. Brown, John Watson, A. Mosher, and Rodin Dunbar, each of whom erected a dwelling, and some of them other buildings. Just south of the above claims, on section seven, Orin Chatfield had taken some land, and in 1856, he commenced the erection of a saw-mill, he built a dam and thus created a fall that gave him power sufficient for his purpose. This mid was about sixty rods above the present mill. The mid could turn out from 700 to 1,000 feet of lumber each day, and from its product the village was built, and the neighboring farmers supplied with lumber from the native timber. This mill kept up its vibrations for ten years when it was secured by the flour-mdl company, the mater ial going into their flume and dam. The place was at first called Newport, but as it might be confounded with some of the numerous Newports in other States, it was soon changed to New House, in honor to Mr. Nyhus, on whose land it stands. The technical description of the frac tion of a section on which it stands is the south east of the northwest of section twenty-nine. Post-offioe. \u2014 The first Postmaster was Ole B. Nelson, who kept it at the station. Ole T. Nyhus is now Postmaster, and he has a deputy who keeps the office at the depot. RICEFORD. This is one of the Houston county villages in the town of Spring Grove; its position is on Rice ford Creek, and lays mostly in the southwest quar ter of section six. It is regularly laid out, and has the mill-pond on the south, from which the river curves around toward the north and skirts the village on the east. The streets running east and west, beginning at the north side of the village, areRichland, Elm, Mill, and Vine. The other way, beginning at the river, there is Main, Second, Third, and Fourth. None of these streets are very thickly settled, except Main street, and that can not be said to be crowded. Before the town was located here, some idea was entertained of estab dshing it on the flat about half a mde north of Where it was finally placed. This would have been near the Crystal flouring mill, but this pro ject was finally abandoned. A vdlage, which at one time was an ambitious suburb of Riceford, called South Riceford, was laid out on the side hill south of the creek; it had its Main street, its Water street, and its Line street, on the northern border, but it was finally abandoned, and the dwellings removed or torn down. The property changed hands many times, and is now owned by M. A. Colt. In 1856, Job Brown began the erection of a flouring mdl on his property here. It was John Muns who brought the first load of tools and material to build this mill. The dam was placed about forty rods below the saw-mill. The building was of stone, 24x40 feet, two and one-half stories high, with two run of stones, one of them being small. The fall secured was nine feet, and a turbine wheel was put in. The machinery, at this day, would not be con sidered very grand, although the mill had a daily capacity of 250 bushels. It was overrun with grists to grind, and was often filled with sacks awaiting their turn, which woidd not be around for weeks perhaps. It had but a single bolting cloth, but did a very profitable business. It seems that the name was given in 1856, in this way, Hon. H. M. Rice, of St. Paul, visited the locality about that time, and following an Indian Trad forded the river about twenty rods from the Crystal mill, and from this circumstance the place was called Riceford. Its Early History.\u2014 It was first taken from the government by Wm. D. Van Doren, in the fall or winter of 1854, and he put up a log shelter. He was originally from New York State, and after In 1860, Mr. E. Thompson, now of Hokah, pur chased the mill and ruu it for a time, when it was finally leased to Mr. V. T. Beeby. In 1866, Mr."], [486, "472 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. M. Bernatz became the owner, and soon transfer red it to his sons, Anthony and George. In 1875, it passed into the hands of Oatman & Co., who, the following year, made important improvements, putting in a new dam of a substantial character, and increasing the head of water to sixteen feet. When Brown sold out he had taken out one run of stones, but they were replaced by Bernatz. What is most remarkable, the identical stones used by Brown for grinding wheat are still used here for the same purpose, as they are of a very supe rior quality, and other millers have offered as high as $1,000 for them. were put in, and a turbine wheel, and on the 9th of November, 1869, it went into operation. The dam, however, proved incompetent to stand the spring flood, and in March, 1870, it went out; and having thus contracted a bad habit, it was kept up, and each season with the breaking up of the ice the dam regularly joined the procession in its aqueous march to the sea. But in 1876, the monotony of this proceeding was summarily in terrupted by the construction of a substantial stone dam, which has been thus far able to with stand the annual invitation to join its predecessors down below, and it bids fair to remain a permanent structure. THE FIRST STORE. The mill is now operated by V. T. Beeby ; is first-class in all respects, and contains, besides the two run of stones, three sets of rolls, two bolting chests of three reels each, middlings purifiers, and all the modern appliances for the manufacture of the finer grades of flour. There is a fall of ten feet, and the power is communicated by two tur bine wheels. The capacity is now 160 bushels a day. In an addition to the mill there is an engine lathe where iron work can be done. Soon after Mr. Brown came here he opened a store in a small building just north of the mill. In 1858, he erected a frame building opposite the mill, and soon put his goods in that. It was on or near the site of the first Van Doren habitation. Since Mr. Brown sold out there have been many changes in the personnel of the trade here. At one time there were two stores with general mer chandise, two hotels, two mills, two blacksmith shops, two shoe shops, a foundry, wagon shop, and other concomitants of a thriving village. These were palmy days for Riceford, for then it caught business from the north and from the south, and the traveler from the east or west was put under contribution for refreshment and sleep. The town was a business center. The stores were busy, the hotels were full, the mills were crowded with grain, the shops were occupied with business, and to use a modern phrase, everything was \"booming.\" Foundry. \u2014 In the year 1869, Mr. D. A. Sher wood erected a building 18x30 feet, put in a cu pola furnace and begun iron casting. He did a very good business, amounting to three or four thousand dollars a year, but since the decadence of the village began, there has been a regular fall ing off, and $800 worth of work would cover the year's operations. There is a wagon and repair shop in connection with it which does some work. School. \u2014 The first school was taught by Mr. V. T. Beeby, in the summer of 1858, in private houses. There was a building called the Slab schoolhouse, over in Fillmore county, where the children sometimes went. At first, several failures of the wheat crop, and then the building of the railroad, which inaugur ated a new order of things which finally gave the village the coup de grace. At present there is the mill, a store, a foundry, a blacksmith shop, and a stopping place for itinerants. Who can ted when again the hum of industry shall enliven this vd lage which once seemed so promising ? In 1868, the present frame building was con structed; it is 20x30 feet, is surmounted by a belfry and a bed, and cost about $600. Sunday School. \u2014 A Sunday school is in opera tion under the auspices of the American residents; its sessions are at the schoolhouse, and from four teen to sixteen scholars are regularly taught. The Crystal Mill. \u2014 On section six, in the southwest quarter, may be found this mid. It is on a forty acre lot, purchased by W. H. Rowe, id Dexter & Ripley, in the winter of 1869, and by him conveyed to his daughter, Mrs. S. M. Beeby, wife of V. T. Beeby. In April, 1869, the improvements began, with the construction of a damand the erection of a mill. Two run of stones Mr. C. G. Guttman was the first superintendent, and he was quite instrumental in inaugurating the movement. RELIGIOUS. Mr. G. W. Wilcox, who was a Methodist, did the first preaching in the village, in his own dwelling"], [487, "SPRING GROVE TOWNSHIP. 473 in 1857 ; no organization was had, but meetings were held quite regularly and some interest worked up. It seems that Job Brown was brought under this influence, became concerned for his spiritual welfare, and finally began to preach himself. Preston. Afterwards it became a \"star route,\" and came through tri-weekly. The railroad destroyed this line and finally a cross route was put on be tween Houston and Decorah, and this gives a daily mail which, however, now is via Mabel sta tion and Houston. The Quakers. \u2014 Daniel Haviland, who was from Michigan, had a leaning toward the tenets of this faith, and several meetings were held at conser vative intervals, not oftener than once or twice a year. No growth or organization ever occurred. BIOGRAPHICAL. Fingal Asleson, one of the early settlers of Spring Grove, is a native of Norway, born in De cember, 1827. He came to America in 1850, and located in Wisconsin, about eighteen mdes from Milwaukee, remaining until June, 1852, when he removed to this place. He pre-empted land and erected his house near a ravine which affords water for family use and also for his stock. Adventists. \u2014 This modern denomination se cured quite a foothold here in 1866. An itiner ant pilgrim, imbued with this faith, held meetings in the schoolhouse, secured a good hearing and considerable interest in the subject. Mr. G. W. Wilcox turned his attention in this direction and continued the meetings for some time after 1867, when a large tent was pitched, and at the meet ings quite a feeling was wrought up and several were baptized. The schoolhouse was afterwards used as a meeting house. V. T. Beeby was born in Delaware county, Pennsylvania, on the 12th of December, 1839. When very young he entered the employ of a drover for whom he worked seven years; first driv ing, and afterward buying stock. Then, after clerking in a store at Templevdle, Maryland, one season,he came to Riceford and was employed in the mdl of Brown and Thompson until 1861, when he rented the establishment, operating it about six years. In September, 1861, Miss Sarah M. Rowe became his wife. She has borne him six chddren, five of whom are living. With the exception of a few years spent in Hokah, and in Lansing, Iowa, Mr. Beeby has run the Crystal, mill since 1869. He is Justice of the Peace, having held the office for the past four years. Norwegian Lutheran Church. \u2014 The congre gation gathered under this name was formerly a part of the Spring Grove church, Rev. F. C. Clauson holding the first meetings here in the schoolhouse across the line in Fillmore county. Under the ministrations of Rev. Styrk S. Reque, of Spring Grove, the church was organized in 1877, and their present church was built at a cost of about $3,000. It is a neat frame structure with a suitable spire. Meetings are held every third Sunday by Rev. E. P. Jensen, who also has the churches at Black Hammer, and Newburg in Fillmore county.

He afterward attended the Lutheran Theo logical Seminary at St. Louis, Missouri; then re turned to Wisconsin, where he was ordained and placed in charge of a field, including churches at Roche-a-Cris, Kilbourn City, Lemonweir, Lewis ton, and Greenwood. He remained in this charge about six and a half years, in the meantime making a short missionary tour through Texas, and one through this State. In 1871, he received and accepted a call from his present congregation, where he has since labored. Besides the Spring Grove Church, he has charge of churches in Black Hammer, Wilmington, and Riceford, the latter society having been organized and a church edifice built under his ministration. He also holds occa sional services at Caledonia. He is assisted in his ministerial labors by Rev. E. P. Jensen, who resides about five miles from the village, and has separate charge of a congregation at Newburg, Fillmore county. The church at Spring Grove numbers about 600 communicants, making, with the other societies under his charge, 1,175 com municants, or 2,250 souls, as shown by the last annual report. On the 2d of July, 1865, Mr. Reque was joined in wedlock with Miss Cecilia Anderson, by which union eight chddren have been born, seven of whom still enjoy the shelter of the parental roof; the other, a son and the first born, is with relatives in Iowa. Mrs. Reque is a daughter of Bjorn and Abel Katherina Anderson, the formor of whom died in Wisconsin during the cholera plague of 1850. The latter, who was the first white woman in Albion, Dane county, Wis consin, is now a member of her daughter's family, and remarkably active, though well advanced in years. Prof. R. B. Anderson, of the Wisconsin State University, author of \"Norse Mythology;\" \"America Not Discovered by Columbus;\" \"Viking Tales of the North,\" and a number of other woiks, is her son. 1871, he bought a harness shop which he carried on until 1878; then went to Kansas and spent a year at his trade. Mr. Smith came to this town in 1879, and opened his present shop, in which he does a good business. He has one child, Laura Bell. Stongrim Stongrimson was born on the 6th of February, 1836, in Sigdahl, Norway. He re mained with his parents engaged in farming, un td coming to America in 1854. After a residence of about a year in Iowa county, Wisconsin, he went to the State of Iowa, and in 1856, came to Spring Grove, locating a farm on section twenty three. Martha Peterson became his wife on the 25th of March, 1861. She has borne him seven children, six girls and one boy. In 1871 they re moved to their present farm in section thirteen ; it is situated only half a mile from the church of Spring Grove, and is in a good state of cultiva tion. D. A. Sherwood, one of the early settlers of this place, was born in Franklin county, New York, on the 15th of November, 1826. He came to Milwaukee with his parents in 1848, and after a residence of five years there came to Spring Grove and located a farm in section seven. He soon gave up farming, and for a number of years devoted his time to hunting and trapping in this vicinity, and finally on the Sioux and Des Moines rivers. At the time of the Indian Massacre, he was near Spirit Lake and assisted in the pursuit of the Indians. In 1862, he enlisted in the Tenth Minnesota Volunteer Infantry, Company F, serv ing until July, 1864, when he was discharged for disability. He then returned to this county and was engaged in farming, and later, at the mould er's trade in Hokah, and Lansing, Iowa. Mr. Sherwood opened his present foundry in 1869, in connection with which he now carries on a black smith shop. Ole Christenson Steneroder, who located in section twelve, Spring Grove, as early as 1853, is a native of Norway, born near Christiania, on the 22d of Aprd, 1824. He is a blacksmith, at which occupation he was employed in his native country until coming to America in 1851. lust before leaving home he was united in marriage with Miss Betsey Erickson. After a short residence in Rock county, Wisconsin, he came here and opened a blacksmith shop, the first in this region, which he still continues, although the last few years he has J. H.

He owns the southeast quarter of section twelve, and has over a hundred acres under cultivation, with good build ings and a fine orchard. Although Mr. Stenero der has never taken an active part in politics, he has been elected to different local offices. Mrs. Steneroder has borne him eight children, only four of whom are living. Their first bom died on the journey here from Wisconsin, and was buried near Decorah, Iowa. The other three are buried in the cemetery at this place. of 1881, at the residence of her son, Levor. At the time of her husband's death, while in a foreign land among entire strangers, she was driven nearly to despair, but bore her lot patiently, placing her trust in the Guardian of the widow and fatherless. Before her death her faith was amply rewarded by seeing prosperity smile upon the homes of her children and children's children. George Timanson, deceased, was one of the pioneers of this place and a prominent politician. He was bom in Norway on the 14th of November, 1826, and came to America, locating in Wiscon- sin in 1848. He came to Spring Grove in 1853, and immediately commenced making improve- ments on land in section fifteen. His house be- ing one of the largest of the first settlers, it be- came the place for holding religious services, Mr. Timanson taking an active interest in the organi- zation and maintenance of the church. Beside filling many local offices he was a member of the State Legislature from this district. His death occurred on the 17th of January, 1878. He was the father of fourteen children, nine of whom are now living. Levor Timanson (Quarve), a son of Thideman Olson Eidahl and Kjevsti Jorgenson Gavnaes, was born the 27th of December, 1830, in the parish of Naes, Hallingdal, Norway. He was reared on a farm, spending most of his time herding cattle in the mountains. His father had a large famdy of children whom he endeavored to bring up practical men and women, but in those mountainous dis- tricts their school advantages were very limited. The instructions imparted to Levor were at home in a catechism, his school days being but three, writing and arithmetic being learned after he at- tained manhood. In 1848, the family emigrated to America. The journey was long and weari- some, attended by many hardships. The father was removed by death soon after landing in New York, and a month later the family came to Rock county, Wisconsin, where they were welcomed by a few countrymen who had come the year before. Levor found employment as a carpenter, mason, and farm laborer. In 1853, in company with some friends, he made a trip to Southern Minnesota and Iowa, in search of good farming land. The fol- lowing spring Mr. Timanson located two miles west of Spring Grove, where he still resides en- gaged in farming and stock raising. Having thus procured himself a home he married Miss Kresti Knudson Berg in May, 1856. The result of this union was eleven chddren, seven of whom are dv- ing. Mr. Timanson now owns land to the amount of eight hundred and forty acres, five hundred and fifty of which are under cultivation. He has taken a prominent part in building and supporting schools and churches, and during the war contrib- uted largely and spent a large amount of time in obtaining volunteers. He is an exemplary hus- band and father, and bore his fud share of trials during his pioneer life. For a time he stood alone in podtics, being the only repubhcan in the town, His mother died in her ninety-first year, in the fad Gunder G. Traaen was born in Norway, on the 24th of June, 1831. He came to America in 1853, and in November of the same year was mar ried to Miss Annie Erickson. They resided in Rock county, Wisconsin, till 1854, when they came to Spring G.ove. Mr. Traaen first took one hun dred and sixty acres of land, but has added to his estate until now he owns about three hundred acres, on which is a fine brick residence, good barns, etc. Of seven children who have been born of this union, only three are now living. Mrs. Traaen also died on the 5th of December, 1881. Ervin Wait is a native of New York, born in Potsdam, St. Lawrence county, on the 23d of Au gust, 1829. His parents came to Chicago,Idinois,in the fad of 1834, thence to Racine county, Wis consin, in the spring of 1838, where they were among the pioneers of the county. The subject of this sketch married Miss Mary Ann Gilmore, on the 19th of October, 1851, and two years later they removed to Lansing Iowa. After a residence of one year in the latter place they were unset tled for a year and a half, coming to this place in the spring of 1856, where they now own a fine farm.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION \u2014 INDIAN SPRING \u2014 EARLY SETTLEMENT \u2014 VARIOUS EVENTS TOWN ORGANIZA- TION MANUFACTURING SCHOOLS \u2014 RELIGIOUS BIOGRAPHICAL. Crystal Creek rises iu the northwestern corner of the town and flows in a northwestern direction; Indian Spring Brook runs from section twenty eight in a general northeastern direction, and leaves the town from section twelve; and another branch of this stream springs up in section twenty-six, and joins the main channel in section twelve. The town may be said to be well wa tered, although not with well water, for here, as is the rule in the county, digging a well is very often an unsuccessful operation. There may be adven titious circumstances which will permit a well at a reasonable depth, but the only way to be positive in this matter is to try the experiment. Most of the residents have cisterns, which really furnish the best water. Union is the northeast of the four central town ships of the county, and its neighbors are Mound Prairie on the north, Brownsville on the east, May vide on the south, and Sheldon on the west. Its contour is of the most regular irregularity, being very evenly divided between hills and valleys. It is evident that these valleys, which have been scooped out or worn away, have supplied material to make up, perhaps, the state of Louisiana. Had this country remained as it was when first lifting its broad acres above the bosom of the deep, it would have been all ridge land, exhibiting vast plateaus, all unbroken by the deep gorges now everywhere visible. But this seems not to have been the order of creation, and so we are con fronted with these mighty bluffs rising several hundred feet above the water bed below. INDIAN SPRING. This is a fine clear fountain bubbling up from under the edge of a bluff near the highway in section twenty-eight. At this point there used to be a regular encampment for Indians while on hunting and fishing expeditions. This spring also gives the name to the rivulet already de scribed. When the white settlers arrived, the evi dences that this was a grand rendezvous for their nom.ilic predecessors were scattered around to a Union embraces most of a township of govern ment survey, but some of the northwestern sec tions go toward making up the town of Mound Prairie.

Walter Krick put himself on the northeast quarter of section thirty-one, and he re mains there still. Jacob Becker also established himself on section thirty-one, and in about 1869, went to Hokah. Daniel Klein, who married Kath erine, a daughter of Henry Snure, located on sec tion thirty. He also had the Hokah fever, but after a residence there for a time it subsided, and he returned, but whether a sadder or wiser man is not recorded. Jacob Klein married Agnes Snure and he may still be found on section thirty, an in dustrious and thriving farmer. EARLY SETTLEMENT. David House came from Illinois in 1853, and located a claim in what is called Hokah valley, on section fourteen; with him was his father who re mained a few years, and then went to Kansas. A log dwelling was their first abiding place, but after awhile a more comfortable house was erected. A few years ago Mr. House, who was one of the leading and most enterprising citizens, removed to Hokah, where he is still engaged in trade. Mrs. House was the first white woman to live in town. Simeon Snure was another of those early com ers, he went on section twenty, where he may stid be found. Edwin Butterfield looked at a claim on section fourteen, in the early spring of 1853. He did not stop to make any improvements, but pushed on further west on a prospecting tour. On his re turn he found David House on his quondam terri tory, and as Mr. House had already begun im provements, the unwritten squatter law deterred Mr. Butterfield from any rights in the premises, and be thus narrowly escaped being the first ac tual settler. Mr. Butterfield then did the next best thmg by going on to section thirteen.to which he brought his family in September, and opened a farm. Mr. Hiram Griffin was the first settler on section twelve, but after a time he went to Iowa. Clark W. Thompson, of Hokah, was more or less inter ested in the early settlement of Union. Charles Klein was in town for a time, but finally made his home in Mayvide. John Klein came to Hokah as an early settler, but he now lives in Union on sec tion four. Among other early comers should be mentioned W. H. Younglove, James Franklin, John Hur ley, and Edward Null. Quite a number of land speculators came in; watching opportunities to get something for nothing. But such adven turers did not meet with great success here. He was a native of New York State, and came to Union from Hlinois. He remained up to the year 1868 when he was carried by the emigration tide to Dakota, and has since joined the great ma jority. After this, for a few years, the eligible loca tions were rapidly taken, and the territory of the township was covered by local claimants, who have proved to be an industrious class of people. Frank J. Kitzinger seems to have been the next man to start a home in this then western wild. He planted his boundary stakes in section fifteen, and opened and kept the first hotel, bnt now resides in Hokah. To show how the enterprising people of those primitive times executed pubdc works, which were of great magnitude, considering the re source., at command, an account of the building of a \"school meeting house,\" in District No. 44, will be here presented: A subscription paper was duly drawn up, in which the articles oppo site the names were pledged to the object in view. This was handed around, with the following re sult: In 1853, not long after the previous arrivals, Mr. Marcus Sammons arrived and selected five forties in the northeastern part of section twenty nine. In a few years he was absorbed by the vil lage of Hokah, where he died just before the war. In 1854, Henry Snure, Sr., dawned upon the scene and also took land in section twenty -nine. It is gratifying to know that his lamp still holds out to bum. With him came William Henry Snure. John Snure, one quarter of an acre of land on the northwest corner of the northeast quarter of section twenty-nine. In the fall of 1855, George Snure, a son of Henrv Snure, Sr., Walter Krick, Jacob Becker, and Daniel Klein, a desirable quartette, arrived from Upper Canada, about twelve miles from Niagara Falls. George Snure remained with his Jacob Klein, four 20 foot logs, and 100 feet of boards.

Some of these reported in person to the Provost Marshal, and some of them paid the $300 commutation or pro cured a substitute. Henry Snure, four 20 foot logs, one square of shingles, 100 feet\" of boards, 300 lath, and one window. James Franklin, four 20 foot logs and eight beams. Martin Youn'glove, four 20 foot logs, Daniel Klein, four 20 foot logs and twenty pounds of nails. The First Hotel. \u2014 The first public house opened within the limits of the town was the Union House, by Frank J. Kitzinger, who now resides in Hokah. The house was burned and afterwards rebuilt. John Hurley, four 18 foot logs and one square of shingles. John Roach, three 18 foot logs. John Hyke, four 18 foot logs and one square of shingles. The Valley House was kept by Martin Neu bury, now of Sheldon, who came here about 1859. Jacob Baker, four 18 foot sleepers and fifteen pounds of nails. Benjamin Franklin, three 18 foot sleepers. Thomas White, one 12 light window, 8x10. Walter Krick, two windows, 12 lights, 8x10. TOWN ORGANIZATION. The organization of the town was completed on the 5th of April, 1859, when the first town meet ing was held at the house of F. J. Kitzinger, Oli ver Nelson was Chairman, and Edmund Null, Clerk. The Supervisors elected were : Benjamin Franklin, Chairman, John Hurley, and Henry Snure; Town Clerk, Edmund Null; Justices of the Peace, David House and Simeon Snure; As sessor, Edwin Butterfield; Collector, John Culver; Constables, Abner Seaman and James Franklin; Overseer of the Poor, Oliver Moran; Pound Mas ters, W. H. Younglove and David House. Henry Snure, Jr., one window of 12 lights. George M. Snure, eight pairs of rafters. Wm. Youn glove, fifteen one inch boards. All the material was to be on the ground by the first of March, 1859. The first trustees of this school were, John Hurley, Henry Snure, and J. H. Huyck. Edward Null was the clerk. Of course co-operation like this would promptly put up the building, which the specifications demand ed should be 18x20 feet. VARIOUS EVENTS. The present town officers are: Supervisors, Benjamin Franklin, Chairman, Thomas Sheehan, Patrick Toole ; Clerk, John J. Sheehan ; Treasurer, John Hurley; Assessor, Thomas Hartly; Justices of the Peace, Elijah Bump and Isaac Holliday; Constables, Charles Fitting and Daniel O'Leary. In the absence of any record evidence, it seems impossible to determine the exact date or the name of the first white person to pass over the unknown road to the other side. It has been said, that time and space are but appearances when viewed in connection with the boundless creation, and if so, after all it matters little as to the first event, al though there is always an absorbing interest in this regard, which may only be equaled by the solemnity always enshrouding the last of anything. The town has been carefully governed, and the administration of affairs been economically at tended to by the various officers who have been from time to time chosen. Without attempting to be positive on the point raised, it may be recorded that Samuel Hall, the grandfather of the present David House, was quite likely the first to cross the unknown stream. James Kyle died in July, 1855, and John Franklin lost a child in the fall of that year. MANUFACTURING. Union Valley Mill. \u2014 This was built by Mr. Edwin Butterfield. It is 26x36 feet, with a capa city of fifty bushels a day. It also grinds feed, and has three run of stones, with smutters, separa tors, etc., and the power is transmitted by a thirty - bix inch turbine wheel. There is a twelve foot fad, but the water is a little scant for the demands of the mill, and usually runs but ten or twelve hours a day. Mr. Butterfield removed to Dakota, where he died in 1879, The mid is now operated by Bernsdorf & Semling. The earliest religious services must have been by Mr. John Hooper, the Methodist Missionary. Joseph Phillips had five sons in the Union army. The men from Union who had successful tickets in the draft to fill the quota of the town, were"], [499, "UNION TOWNSHIP. 485 POST-OFFICE. RELIGIOUS. Like almost all of the newly settled jDjrts of the country, the colonists, coming from divers places, where each had been favored with the opportunity to attend upon the particular denominational teaching of his choice, would naturally become restive under a deprivation of the privilege, and would put in operation such agencies avadable, as might promise to build up a like society in the new settlement. Representatives of the various sects thus differing, and each seeing no good rea son why all the others should not unite with them, and very few being prepared to sacrifice their sectarian feelings for the common good; the result was many abortive attempts to budd up societies, and many feeble organizations coming to an untimely end from sheer inanition. In many cases, were it possible, a union of the Protestant elements in a settlement, in imitation of their coherent Roman brethren, would build a church and handsomely support a pastor, where now the straggling missionary and the jaded circuit rider makes an occasional call. The Post-office was established in 1857, on sec tion twenty. The first Postmaster was Henry Snure. The office was moved to section twenty nine, and Edmund Null was Postmaster,but about 1875, it was discontinued. Union has no village, but is situated between, and about equi-distant from, Hokah, Caledonia, Brownsville, and Houston, and so the people are about as well accommodated, particularly those around the outskirts, as though they had a village in the center of the town. SCHOOLS. There are only three districts in town and con sequently some of the children have long distan ces to travel. District No. 29. \u2014 A school was first taught in the valley on section twelve, in a house built by Hiram Griffin. Miss Frances Pound was the teacher. Afterwards a log house was put up by contributions of time and timber, Mr. David House furnished logs for one side, Edwin Butter field for another, and Levi West and others for the rest. The district now has a good stone school house. These suggestions are not made here because they apply more forcibly to Union than to many other places in Houston county. St. Peter's Church \u2014 Lutheran. \u2014 Services were held in a schoolhouse as early as 1861. The Rev. Mr. Ebert officiating. In 1870, the church was erected. The first trustees were : Fred. Helm, Fred. Peipon, and Nich. Hening. The first cler gyman after the church was put up was Rev. Frederic Wright. The nextminister was the Rev. John Jahn. The present incumbent is the Rev. Charles Gutknecht. The present trustees are: Aug. Tessen, William Kesten, Henry Dileken, and Charles Menze. When the church was first or ganized it had eighteen members, and now there are twenty -four. The church is a frame building, 22x40 feet, is located on section thirty-two, and was originally built as a Union Christian Church, but finally became denominational. District No. 27. \u2014 Was organized on the 28th of July, 1858, and the number of scholars at that time was forty-four. John Hurley, Henry Snure, Sr., and John H. Hyke were the first trustees, and Edmund Null was elected clerk. At that meeting the site for a schoolhouse was selected at the center of section twenty-nine, where the house was built the same fall and stands there yet. Miss Sarah A. Lyon was the first teacher, in an old log shanty first rolled together as a residence by Marcus Sammons. In the autumn of 1859, a log schoolhouse was laid up with a hip roof, which stdl stands and is the only school building in the north part of the town. It is on section twenty-nine. This district should be divided, for the distance for some of the children is so great that they are practically deprived of school privileges. German Reformed Church. \u2014 The society was organized about 1874, and started out with eight members, and soon after a church was put up 22x36 feet. It is a neat structure, with a spire, is painted white, and has a seating capacity of 200. It cost $800, besides the volunteer labor, and is located on section thirty-one. District No. 28. \u2014 This schoolhouse, which is a neat little affair on section twenty-six in Thomp son's Valley, was built in 1860. Union Sunday School.\u2014 In 1860, a Sunday school was inaugurated in the valley, in number twenty-nine schoolhouse, and it was kept up for many years. Mr. Lewis Pound was the Superin tendent. Rev.

Chaeles Bbown was born in Ashtabula, Ohio, on the 9th of December, 1847. He assisted his father in the mill until 1861, when he enlisted in the One Hundred and Eleventh Pennsylvania Vol unteer Infantry, serving eighteen months and par ticipating in the battles of Culpepper Court House, Alexandria, and Antietam. On receiving his dis charge he went to Indiana, and soon after to Chi cago, where he engaged to go overland to Cali fornia, with a herd of horses and mules. He remained in the latter State about eighteen mouths, and on returning home found both his father and mother had died during his absence. Mr. Brown was united in marriage with Miss Annie Freeman and soon after came to Houston county, where, with the exception of a year and a half spent in Iowa, they have since resided. William F. Beckeb was born on the 10th of November, 1861. His father, Philip Becker, came from Germany to America with his family, and was among the first settlers of Milwaukee. In 1854, he moved to La Crosse, where he opened a carpen ter shop and remained until about 1866, when he purchased a farm about thirty miles from that city, which is still his home. William remained with his parents until 1880, when he came to this town and engaged with his brother-in-law, F. Berns dorf, in the Union mills. Feedeeick Beensdoef is a native of Prussia, born on the 19th of November, 1847. He assisted in his father's mills until after the death of the lat ter, which occurred in 1859. Then, when his mother again married, Frederick engaged in other mills for a time, returning to the old one three months before its destruction by fire. It was soon rebuilt, the property sold, and the family, consist ing of eight children, came to America in 1865. They located in Missouri, the subject of our sketch remaining at home until the age of twenty-one years. He went to St. Louis, but not finding the employment he wished, came to Wisconsin and en gaged in a mill about ten miles from La Crosse, remaining four years. On the 20th of November, 1879, he was joined in matrimony with Miss Carrie Becker. They came to Union the same year and Mr. Bernsdorf rented his present mill until May, 1881, when he bought the property, taking a part ner a few months after. Jacob B.

Methodist. \u2014 The earliest rengious service by this denomiiiai :on was by a minister from Hokah, at the residence of Jacob Kleia, in 1859 or '60. A class was organized in 1863, in connection with like societies in the vicinity. Rev. John Kolbe officiated once in four weeks. The next minister was Rev. August Lambrecht, who came from Wis consin, preaching every alternate Sunday, and re maining about three years. Then Rev. John Pra}or officiated, foUowed by Rev. Edw. Schuette. The church was built about six years ago and cost $800, and is of wood, 24x32 feet, located on sec tion twenty-nine. Disciples Church. \u2014 Services were commenced about thirteen years ago, at the schoolhouse, by Rev. Charles Chant, an Evangelist from near Wi nona. In 1869, a regular society was organized by Rev. Ebenezer Grant, with six members. In 1875, the church was erected, with a seating ca pacity of from 100 to 120. Rev. J. G. Harrison supplied the pulpit at one time. Since 1879, there has been no regular supply. The church is in section twenty-nine. Meetings are kept up by the members, and the Sunday school is still sustained. biographical. Elijah Bump, one of the prominent political men of this town, is a native of New York, born in Genesee county, on the 24th of May, 1823. He moved with his parents to Erie county, Penn sylvania, when eleven years of age. In 1845, he was joined in matrimony with Miss Martha M. May, of Ohio. Mr. Bump purchased his present farm in 1856, but resided in Wisconsin until 1864, since which time he has been a resident of this place. He has held a number of local offices such as Town Clerk, Justice of the Peace, etc. Mr. and Mrs. Bump have been blessed with three children, the eldest, Loren E., enlisted in the Eleventh Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry, when fif teen years of age, serving till the close of the war, and is now employed as engineer on the Southern Minnesota Railroad.

He was married to Miss Catherine Stiem on the loth of July, 1867. They have had six children the eldest of whom died in 1869. Rev. Chables Gutknecht, pastor of the Lu thern Church at Union, is a native of Mecklen burg, Germany, born on the 7th of January, 1851. In 1870, he came with his parents and brother to America, resided for one year in Farnham, New York, then came to Minnesota, locating in Jordan, Scott county. In 1874, he entered the Concordia College at Springfield, Illinoisj graduating in 1879. The same year he was united in marriage with Miss Mary Lauer, of .Stacy, Minnesota. She has borne him two children, Clara and Ida. Soon after graduating, he was ordained and came to Union, which has since been his home. Besides his charge in this place he conducts services in the Evangelical Lutheran Churches at Hokah, Brownsville, and Portland Prairie. Knud Johnson was born in the northern part of Norway, on the 11th of April, 1826. His father died when Knud was but six years of age, after which he supported himself by herding cattle and working for the farmers. At the age of eighteen years he went to Christiania and learned the shoe maker's trade, at which he was engaged until 1851. He then came to America, was six weeks on the ocean, having encountered heavy storms, and arrived in New York in June. He came to Dane county, Wisconsin, and the following Sep tember went into the Michigan pineries, remaining during the winter and spring, In 1853, he went to Dane county, Wisconsin, and was employed ia a saw-mill for a time. He then went to Stillwater and was engaged in rafting on the lakes, and thence to Fillmore county, where he purchased a farm and made his home for five years. In 1857, he married Miss Maria Johnsdatter, of Spring Grove. They came to this place and Mr. Johnson bought his present farm on which he has since lived. His wife died, and in 1869, he married Miss Berit, Evansdatter. Never having been blessed with any children of their own, they have adopted two of Mr. Johnson's nephews. Jacob Klein is a native of Bavaria, born on the 19th of December, 1824, and came with his parents to Canada in 1840. He came to Union in 1854, took a claim in section thirty and erected a shanty, where he resided about a year, cooking his own meals and doing his own housework. In 1855, he was united in marriage with Miss Agnes Snure, daughter cf Henry Snure, one of the first settlers of the place. They went to Canada but soon returned to Union, where his wife died about a year after her marriage. In 1860, he returned to Canada and married Miss Catharine Becker who has borne him six children ; Louis, Elizabeth, Wil liam, Addie, Jacob, and Allie. In 1874, Mr. Klein erected his present fine stone residence. He has held the office of Supervisor a number of times be sides other local offices. Walter Keick, one of the leading political men of tliis town, is a native of Bavaria, born on the 16th of December, 1832. When nineteen years of age he came to Canada, and the following year was joined by his mother and brothers. In the spring of 1855, he came to Union and pre empted a claim of one hundred and sixty acres in section thirty-one, the family following the next year. They erected a log house, in which they lived two years, then built the present frame struc ture. In about 1863, they added one hundred and sixty acres to their former purchase, and a few years later divided the farm between the four brothers, Walter retaining the south half of the original claim, where he now resides. In 1867, he was united in marriage with Miss Louisa J. Snure. They have been blessed with three daughters. John Keick, a brother of the subject of oitr last sketch, was also born in Bavaria, his birth dating the 26th of December, 1838. His father died"], [502, "HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. 488 spring of 1854, he came to Union with his nephew, W. H. Snure, and erected a shanty in which they resided one season. Then our subject re turned to Canada and brought with him to Union four daughters and one son. In the fall of 1855, he again returned to Canada, disposed of his property there and returned to this place, accom panied by his wife aud youngest daughter. In 1865, his wife died, and two of his daughters, Mrs. Demo and Louisa, made their home with him. In 1867, Louisa married Mr. Krick, and Mr. Snure resided with her five years, but for the past year has made his home with Mr. and Mrs. Demo. Since leaving Canada he has devoted the greater portion of his time to the carpenter trade. when John was an infant, leaving his mother aud four brothers with a very small farm, which they cultivated until coming to America in 1852. They came to this place in 1856, and in about 1866, divided the farm as above stated, our sub ject retaining that portion on which the first house was built. His mother resided with him until her death, which occurred in 1871. Mr. Krick has held a number of local offices since his residence in the town. He was joined in matri mony, in 1868, with Miss Elizabeth Becker. Their chddren are Louis and Lizzie. Henry Snure is a native of Canada, born about fourteen miles from Niagara Falls in 1804.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION FIRST SETTLERS FIRST BIRTH FIRST DEATH PORTLAND PRAIRIE The method most frequently adopted now, is to create artificial ponds by throwing dams across little ravines at suitable points to secure a supply, which the clayey nature of the soil retains from one rain to another, to be used for watering the stock. Where wells are sunk they have to be quite deep to reach the water bearing strata which is often one hundred and seventy feet below the surface. FIRST REAPER HOG CHOLERA RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS BIOGRAPHICAL. This town is the third from the Mississippi River on the southern boundary of the county, which is also the State line. In form and size it coincides with a township of government survey. In its topography it is not unlike the neighbor ing towns, quite broken and uneven, but with a productive sod, bearing in its primitive condition a light growth of small oak, poplar, and hazel brush. In the southeast corner, Portland Prairie extends into the town and embraces several sec tions. This prairie is rolling and somewhat broken, interspersed with groves which have in creased in size since the suppression of the prairie fires. The character of the soil on the more elevated portions is of a clayey nature, while in the de pressions the soil is richer in vegetable mould with a gravel or clayey subsod. Portland Prairie has a rich dark loam with a sub-stratum of clay. The town is devoid of any barren spots, being productive with ordinary treatment. The town originally labored under the native disability of this section of country, a want of wa ter for domestic and stock purposes, and the set tlers had to resort to the \"hauley system\" as they FIRST SETTLERS. The new territory of Minnesota was set off from the northwestern territory in 1849, and the first settlements of course were along the Mississippi"], [503, "WILMINGTON TOWNSHIP. 489 River, which was the only thoroughfare at that time. The tide of emigration on the southern boundary extending from the river, got ahead of the government survey, even of the State line, and some of the early settlers found the claims they had staked out bisected by the surveyor's chain, leaving part in Minnesota and a part in Iowa. In June, 1851, a family of Robinsons, consisting of the widow of James and her family of sons, Wil dam, Henry, John, and George, the oldest being hardly of age, came from Columbia county, Wis consin, and located near the State line, celebrat ing the 4th of July by the raising of a log house. Henry Robinson, one of the brothers, took a claim of eighty acres in section thirty-six, and put up a shanty in 1852. nent settlers located on Portland prairie. Among the more prominent Americans who came were C. F. Albee, Dr. Alexander Batchellor, John McNelly, Jeremiah Shumway, J. G. Cook, James and Duty Paines and others. In the part of the town where the Norwegians reside, the early settlers were Halver Peterson, Knudt Severson, Knud Olson, and Ole O. Hefte, besides several others. The Americans came from Rhode Island and Massachusetts, arriving by the river, at Lansing, without having any specific knowledge of where they were going except \"to Minnesota.\" The land office was located at Brownsvide, and some of the party having examined the location, they ad con cluded not to look any further. This party bought out John Edger, and it is said that for a time the cabin had sixteen inmates. A tribe of Winnebagoes was at that time on the Iowa River, and they not unfrequently came among the white settlers to barter their peltries. Henry Robinson at this time cultivated his land, but re sided with his mother on the Iowa side of the dne until 1861, when he moved to his present home. The first cabin in due time gave place to the com fortable residence, now the home of Mrs. Wm. Robinson. Settlers now begun to come in quite rapidly. Asa Sherman, it is claimed, built the first frame house on the prairie. He was afterwards, as it was supposed, drowned in the Mississippi. The house he built is the old one now on the Metcalf place. George Shumway, R. E. Shumway, John Albee, and Horace Arnold arrived together in 1855, and about the same time Arnold Stone, James Emer son, and Amos Lapham arrived. All these must be regarded as the first comers, and down to the spring of 1856, there were built about eight dwel lings, and most of these were small and rude log cabins. Further arrivals of well known par ties subsequently took place in about the follow ing order: Comedus Metcalf, jr.,in 1857; his father and family, William Cass and Leonard Albee, with their respective families, in 1858; H. W. Pease, from Maine, the same year; D. P. Temple in 1859; L. L. Lapham in 1860; E. C. Arnold iu 1861; H. P.Kelly in 1862; C. F. Wright in 1863; and Amos Arnold and Joel S. Yeaton in 1864. Quite a number of others are remembered as transient residents, while many, arriving soon after, stdl re main. In the year 1852, there came George Carver, a sturdy pioneer, who occupied the Iowa side of the line. The same year a small settlement was made on section thirty-two, near the present mill and store north of Bergen Post- office. There were four in the party, all natives of Ireland. John Edger was one of them, he broke up twenty-five acres the following summer, but soon sold out and removed to the southeast part of the town, but sub sequently went to Iowa, where he still resides. Michael Callahan was another, the father-in-law of Edger. His claim, which he held with Mr. Edger, was sold to Ole Bye. Charles Kelly also selected land just north of the others, but he, with a blacksmith named Michael Tanner, not finding work, soon left. Gjermund Johnson was unquestionably the first Norwegian to enter the town, which he did in the summer of 1853, taking a claim on section sixteen, putting up a shanty and making some improve ments, but he soon changed to sections seven aud eighteen, where he now lives on a good farm. Ole Bye, who bought the claim as above related, after wards, in 1856, moved to the east line of section thirty-three, where he resided until the time of his death. During the season of 1854, many perma- The First Birth. \u2014 A few days after the arrival of Mr. Charles Kelley and his wife Margaret, in the fall of 1852, while they stdl lived in their wagon, the premonitions appearing, Mrs. Kelly was taken into the house or cabin of Mr. Edger, near by, where a son was born and his name called James, who is now a man nearly thirty years of age, and a resident of Northern Iowa, where he is in business in New Albin."], [504, "490 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. The First Death. \u2014 Soon after Ole Bye bought his place, his wife was taken sick and died in August, 1853, and was buried in Winneshiek county, Iowa. a threshing machine arrived about the same time. At first there was absolutely no market for any thing outside of the settlement, so the people de voted their time to making themselves comforta ble, and to do this, what was regarded as a recrea tion, hunting and fishing, was a part of the em ployment. The amount of money in circulation, especially during the panic of 1857, would require but a few figures to represent. The First Marriage. \u2014 The initial event of this character to vary the monotony of pioneer life, was the union of Ole A. Quarle and Sarah Ev erson, which was celebrated by the Rev. Mr. Car son, of Decorah, at the house of Gjermund John son, on section seven, in 1855. They lived in the town, raising a family of children, of whom four are stid living. Mr. Quarle died in 1877, and his widow stid manages the farm. There was a single heavy old time made rifle, brought here by Charles Albee, ard this was brought into frequent requisition to kdl deer at long range, which were found along the river bluffs. The prairie chickens also had a peculiar fascination for the New Englanders, while the enormous catfish of the Mississippi were a never ending source of astonishment, in comparison with the diminutive namesake in eastern waters. About the first marketing of wheat realized the munificent amount of thirty-eight cents a bushel, in Lansing ; which was also the nearest Post-office for some time. Portland Prairie was the first part of the town settled, and as that lies partly in Wilmington, partly in Winnebago, and partly in Iowa, all mak ing one neighborhood, little attempt will be made in a description of the locality, to regard the town or State line. The county records show that the ownership of the prairie farms, for a dozen years or so from the first settlement, frequently changed hands. The Germans and Scandinavians were appearing to take up the remaining vacant lands, or purchase of the Americans who desired to sell their improvements. Like most frontier places the first residences were not commodious, but com fortable log cabins, requiring little except a few days' hard labor to erect. Many families had to bear their inconveniences many years before the luxury of a frame house could be enjoyed. The farming at first was of a rude character, with appliances such as were in vogue before the era of machinery, and while there was an abiding faith in the ability of the soil to produce root crops, com and oats, there was many a dubious shake of the head when wheat was mentioned. In 1856, a mail route was established between Brownsville and Dorchester, and Dr. Batchellor was appointed Postmaster, and Con. Metcalf was deputy. John Cook was the next Postmaster, and during President Lincoln's administration R. E. Shumway was appointed. The residents in the northern part of the town, as a rule, came by way of Brownsville, while those in the south generally came through Lansing or McGregor. There were then two settlements of Norwegians, those who were in the vicinity of Ole Bye, in the southern part, and those who rallied around Gjermund Johnson, in the northern portion of the township. But like many another question, practical ex periment soon solved the problem in the affirma tive, although most of the flour at first used came from outside of the county. Wheat, oats, aud corn soon began to be established crops. The trouble of getting it ground, at first very serious, was in a few years rendered satisfatory by Messrs. Harney & Edward Bell, who built a log mill and set it to running in Dorchester. Another important settlement at an early day, as well as at present, is known as the American Settlement, the personnel of which has already been given. The predominating element is still American on what is called the prairie; there are a few of Irish extraction, but the rest of the town was settled by people from Norway. Four years after the general settlement of the community the first schoolhouse was built. Be fore this time it was hardly required, as most of the settlers were young men whose children were not yet of a school age. The mad facilities were so slow and imperfect, that few newspapers were taken. Letters or papers mailed in the East were ten to fifteen days on the road, and news on reach- The first reaper was a McCormick, which, al though an improvement upon the sickle and the cradle, must be regarded as the progenitor of the present self-binder, developed by the law of selec tion and the survival of the fittest. It was intro duced by Samuel Evans about the year 1857, and"], [505, "WILMINGTON TOWNSHIP. 491 ing the settlement would be so old as to lose its quality as news, and the settlers had recourse each winter to the debating club, which met in the house of Dr. Batchellor, and afterwards in the school house, where the relative gratitude due by Ameri cans to Columbus or Washington was most vehe mently argued; with questions as to the beauties of nature and art, and whether capital punishment should be abolished. Thus the tedium of the long winter evenings was bridged over. dread disease can be effected by feeding a variety of food until the animal is well grown, when corn can be used to complete the fattening, without danger of an attack from this fatal malady. The town of Wilmington has many fine houses, barns, and out-buildings, and well cultivated farms scattered over the hills and valleys. The citizens are certainly entitled to credit for what has been done to produce homes for themselves and their families; for the amount of labor required in a new country to make the permanent improvements, in addition to the every day work and the annual crop- raising, is most enormous. And when we remember that the settlers in a new and untried country had to feel their way as to the crops that could be successfully raised, we can appreciate what has been accoinpdished by these sturdy pi oneers. The war of 1861, of courae created the usual ex citement, and enlistments were the order of the hour. The names of those who enlisted from this town, as far as ascertained, will be found in the county history. The Sioux massacre of 1862 caused the most alarming panic throughout the whole Northwest, extending to Lake Michigan. The roads were fided with panic stricken settlers fleeing from the imaginary tomahawk and scalping knife. TOWN ORGANIZATION. The first town meeting was held on the 11th of May, 1858, in what was known as the Norwegian schoolhouse, the present dis trict No. 58, located near the center of section twenty-eight. Mr. M. Glanville was chosen Mod erator, and John G. Cook and Silas Perry, Clerks of election. The following officers were chosen : Supervisors, A. Batchellor, Chairman, Jeremiah Shumway, and Herman Peterson ; Clerk, John Mc- Nelly; Assessor, Asley Swanson; Codector, G. Pope; Overseer of the Poor, C. F. Albee; Justices of the Peace, J. G. Cook and Sdas C. Perry ; Con stables, J. M. Paine and Peter O. Quarle. . The people of Wilmington, like the rest, became thoroughly frightened, and while some remained on their farms, most of them started with their fam ilies and what few valuables they could carry, for Lansing. When near the southeastern part of the town, in the vicinity of Mr. C. F. Albee's farm, the American residents succeeded in halting the fugitives, and to assure them that there was no danger, C. F. Albee and A. Sherman started on horseback for Spring Grove, to learn whether the Indians were really there, as all comers reported, murdering the people and burning all before them. Everything having been reported as quiet as the conventional Potomac, the people slowly went back to their recently forsaken homes, but as many of them had turned their cattle into the grain, the* losses were quite heavy. At this meeting the town was subdivided into nine ward districts, with the following overseers : Mike McGinnis, G. Anderson, H. Peterson, G. Gilbertson, Knud Severson, Knud Anderson, Alex. Batchellor, A. Swanson, and T. Oleson. A resolution that hogs should be permitted to run at large was unanimously adopted. The meeting then adjourned. The Crops Raised. \u2014 In relation to the agricul tural products, it may be said that after the first efforts to procure a subsistence, the farming grad ually drifted into wheat as a staple crop to be raised for market,but for various reasons, which are under laid by the pecuniary one, there has been another change going on, and corn is now extensively raised and transmuted into pork, which has for several years been bringing remunerative prices. There has been some hog cholera, as it is called, due to a disremembrance of the fact, that a hog is not exclusively a granivorous animal, but is omnivor ous, feeding, in a natural state, on animal and veg etable food as wed. So that a prevention of this And thus the town of Wilmington was started on its career as a municipality. The present town officers are : Supervisors, Ole Onsgard, Chairman, E. H. Edestad, and Andrew Bye; Clerk, Ole O. Myhre; Treasurer, Swan Asleson; Assessor, John McNelly; Justices of the Peace, Jacob Johnson and Wm. McNelly; and Constable, Swan Asleson. religious. Early in the history of the town, an agent of the Sunday School Union opened a Sunday school, which was held from time to time in private houses"], [506, "492 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. on Portland Prairie, in the southeastern part of the town. These meetings were patronized from quite a distance, children and adults coming from Iowa and the neighboring towns, regardless of their religious behef. has been attempted, as its adherents go to Caledo nia to receive the ministrations of the church. SCHOOLS. The town is well supplied with schools, and a history of each will be here presented. Methodist. \u2014 Like all frontier towns this place was at first a missionary field, and itinerants from various denominations prospected here, but the Methodists seemed to secure a lead, and obtained a foothold, and in 1876, a church was erected just across the Winnebago line, and although, perhaps, a majority of the memb ?rs reside in this town, its complete history is given in the sketch of Win nebago. District No. 58. \u2014 This was the first district in which a school was held, and it was in a private house, before a schoolhouse was erected. It was Norwegian in its attendance and teaching, and was sustained by subscription. It was migratory, being kept at the houses of Thomas Anderson, A. Swanson and others, until 1857, when the Nor wegian schoolhouse was built, each settler having been put under contribution for two logs; ad turning out to assist in putting it up, and it con tinued as a schoolhouse, church, and pubdc had until 1878, when the present building was con structed, on section twenty-seven, where the school now is kept. Norwegian Lutheran Church. \u2014 Among the first meetings held in town were those of this de nomination; they have the only church, and a very large congregation. The first service of this character was held by Rev. Mr. Koren, at the house of Gjermund Johnson, located on section seven. This was in 1855 or '56, and about that time occasional meetings were also held at various houses, and in 1857, after the completion of the old schoolhouse on section twenty-eight, a meeting was convened by him there, which was made an interesting occasion by a large attendance from miles around, and the baptising of fifteen children. As a general thing, the Norwegians in this local ity are devout Christians and members of the Lu theran Church. After a few years Mr. Koren was succeeded by Rev. Mr. Clauson, who held not very regular service in the schoolhouse for several years. Finally, in 1868, the church now in use was erected near the old schoolhouse on section twenty-eight. Rev. S. T. Reque, of Spring Grove, is the pastor, and service is held every two or three weeks. District No. 59. \u2014 This is on Portland prairie, and is an American district. The first school was in the house of Mr. T. Aldrich, on section twenty five, in 1857, where John McNedy now resides, and was taught by Mary Ann Cook, now Mrs. Amos Glanville. The first schoolhouse was erected, not unlike the one above described, on the community principle. This was in 1858, and on the farm of Mr. T. Aldrich, on section twenty-five. Schools were kept, and rehgious services held there. In 1868, the old schoolhouse was replaced by the present frame structure, which occupies the same site. District No. 53. \u2014 This was also one of the original districts. The first school was taught in a building owned by Mr. A. Gilbertson, in 1857. In a year or two a stone schoolhouse was put on section six, which served for school purposes until 1872, when the present frame building went up. German Lutheran Church. \u2014 The meetings of this denomination are held across the line in Win nebago, where the church is located, and as there are but comparatively few of this class in town, there is no separate organization. Rev. Mr. Clau son used to preach in German for them as long ago as 1863, when the first efforts were made in this interest. District No. 66. \u2014 This was, in 1866, set off from district No. 59, a schoolhouse was soon erected on section twenty-four, and was first taught by Ellen H. Cass. District No. 67. \u2014 The first school was held in a shed attached to the house of Mathew McGinnis, in 1865, and was taught by Miss Dora Quinland, now Mrs. Wm. Murphy, of Caledonia. The school was also held in Mike McGinnis' house. In 1867, a schoolhouse was budt on section thirty, and in 1880, it was moved to its present location on the south line of the same section. Roman Catholic \u2014 As far as known, the only services ever held in town was at the house of Charles McGinnis, in February, 1864, by the priest from Caledonia. There are but few fami lies in town with this faith, and no organization"], [507, "WILMINGTON TOWNSHIP. 493 District No. 70. \u2014 In 1867, this district was set off from No. 59, and the next year a house was built on section thirty-one. Ellen Healy was the first district teacher here, although a private school had previously been taught in settlers' houses by Norwegians in their own tongue, by the use of their own text books. his present farm in section seventeen. In March, 1857, he married Mrs. Carohne Sennes, it being one of the first marriages in the town. In 1864, Mr. Bye enlisted in Company B, of the First Minne sota Heavy Artillery, and served till the close of the war. He has since held the offices of Town Clerk, and Supervisor, and in 1878, was elected to the House of Representatives. Mr. Bye's children number six, and Mrs. Bye has one by her former marriage. District No. 77. \u2014 This district was first or ganized and a building erected on section eighteen, about the year 1870, and a school has been held there ever since. John Engebretson is also a native of Norway. and was bom on the 1st of March, 1832. He was reared to agricultural pursuits, and remained with his parents until coming to Pine Creek, Allamakee county, Iowa, in 1855. On the 5th of March, 1854, he was married to Miss Caroline Hanson. They came to this place in 1856, and have since made it their home. Eight children have been born to this union, all of whom are living. District No. 85. \u2014 This district was instituted in the spring of 1873. A house was at once put up on section twenty-one, and David I. Vinge led off as the first teacher. There is a mill and a store, a blacksmith shop and a Post-office, just on the Iowa line, and if the citizens there were not required to vote in Iowa, they would not know that they -are not Minneso tians. The mill and store were built in 1872, by Joseph Schwarzhoff, the present proprietor. He has a good stock of goods. The mill has two run of stones propelled by water from Waterloo Creek, which here flows between high bluffs. The place is called Bergen. Sven H. Ellestad, the founder of the \"Spring Grove Posten,\" the only newspaper ever published in Spring Grove, was born in Wdmington on the 20th of October, 1859. He received an education in the common schools, and attended the Caledonia Academy for one term. He has always lived with his parents assisting in the farm labor, and iu 1879, taught one term of school. The \"Posten\" was a weekly folio sheet of small dimensions, pudshed in the Norwegian language, the first issue appear ing the 12th of April, 1880. It was received with general appreciation by the public, and especially by those personally acquainted with the editor. After about a year, during which time it made many friends, and was an extraordinary proof of the abdity, enterprise, and genius of the young editor, Mr. Ellestad concluded to discontinue its pubdcation. He has since worked at the printers' trade and taught school, besides working on his father's farm. The Post-office was established in 1872, and Mr. Schwarzhoff was appointed Postmaster. It is a great convenience to the people of the town. biographical. Gilbert Anderson, a native of Norway, dates his birth on the 14th of December, 1827. His younger days were spent in farming, and in 1852, he came to Dane county, Wisconsin, where he was employed in the pineries one winter. Since 1854, Mr. Anderson has been a resident of Wilmington, where he owns a fine farm of four hundred acres. He was united in marriage with Miss Melinda Olson in 1856. She has borne him fourteen chil dren, twelve of whom are living. Mr. Anderson was one of the first trustees when the Spring Grove Lutheran church was organized and has taken a prominent part in rearing the two church edifices there. August Hanebuth was born in Hanover, on the 29th of December, 1844. When he was quite young his parents came to America and located in Illinois, where August remained tid 1862, when he enlisted in the One hundred and fifth Illinois Vol unteer Infantry, Company I, participating in the battles of Atlanta,Peach Tree Creek and others; in 1866, after being discharged, he came to Wilming ton township, purchased his present farm and has since hved here. He married Miss Hannah Was kon on the 14th of February, 1868. They have three chddren; Laura, born on the 2d of May, Andrew Bye has been a resident of this place since 1853, his parents coming in August of that year and locating in section thirty-two. His mother died the same summer, which was the first death in the place. The subject of this sketch was born in Norway, on the 5th of January, 1839. He made his home with his father until coming to"], [508, "494 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. attended school until 1872, when he, in company with bis brother, purchased land in section nine teen. He was married to Miss Caroline Nelson on the 3d of July, 1873. They have had four chil dren, three of whom are living. In 1875, Mr. Lansverk purchased his brother's interest in the farm, and has since made it his home. 1870; Annie, on the 30th of March, 1872; and Ju lius, on the 6th of August, 1874. William Hartley was bom in 1815, in Cam bridgeshire, England, where he was reared on a farm and remained until 1848. He then came to America, locating in Evansville, Indiana, which was his home for seven years, devoting his time to various occupations. Then, after a residence of several years in Allamakee county, Iowa, first on a farm and afterwards in the hotel business, Mr. Hartley came to this place, arriving in April, 1864, and has since labored in the cultivation of his farm. Henry Luehr dates his birth the 4th of April. 1851, in Hanover, where his early days were spent, engaged in farming.

In 1846, he came west as far as Columbia county, Wisconsin, remaining until the early spring of 1851, when he started on foot for the new territory of Minnesota. Crossing the Mis sissippi at McGregor, he pursued his course to the north through Clayton and Adamakee counties in Iowa, fording the intervening streams, which must have been swollen at that season, and on the 15th of March struck the place that filled his require ments for a home, and at once stuck his stakes for a claim of 200 acres on what afterwards proved to be a part of section twenty-four, in Winnebago township, and the rest in the state of Iowa. Some of these early claims, which seemed compact enough when originally marked out by the set tlers before the government survey, were sadly cut up and left laying around loose, after the com pass and chain had been through them. CHAPTER LXVI. DESCRIPTIVE FIRST SETTLERS EARLY EVENTS TOWN ORGANIZATION EITZEN POST-OFFICES SCHOOLS RELIGIOUS STATE AND COUNTY OFFI- CERS BIOGRAPHICAL. This township coincides with the government survey, and is the second from the Mississippi on the southern boundary of the county and State. It ha3 Mayvide on the north, Jefferson on the east, Allamakee county, Iowa, on the south, and Wil mington on the west. The town is drained by Winnebago Creek, which, with the township, gets its name from the Winnebago Indians who used to frequent this region. The main branch of this stream rises near the northwest corner, and run ning south of east, leaves the town about two and a half miles from the southern boundary on the east side. The valley of the river makes well up into the town, and there is the usual hill and dale so characteristic of the west bank of the Mississippi in this vicinity. Away from the creek there is the table land which makes good farms. In the south western part of the township, Portland Prairie comes in, and it is no wonder that the early pio neer, as he climbed the weary way from the river, and his eye rested upon this spot, should have ejaculated, \"thus far and no farther will I go.\" Unpacking his knapsack Mr. Graves went to work, solitary and alone, and put up a shanty on the south half of the southwest quarter of section thirty-four, and, after making some improvements, returned to Wisconsin and induced some of his neighbors to accompany him back, which they did in October of the same year, prepared to remain through the winter. When the lines were ran his friends were found in Iowa. In the winter of 1851-52, he returned to Wis consin for his family, which he installed in the lit tle shanty, and thus it was that Mrs. Graves was the first white woman in this region. That loca tion has since been the home of the famdy, although the size of the farm has been reduced, as in many other cases. The town is well settled with a thriving popu lation, and there are three Post-offices within its borders, with a nucleus for a village at each point, and no one can ted how soon either or ad of them may begin to expand. FIRST SETTLERS. The very first man to stake out a claim in the township was Freeman Graves, a native of Under hid, Chittenden county, Vermont, who, when Another early settler was Asa Beman, a native of Pennsylvania, who at first seleeted some land on section thirty, but soon after went over into 32"], [512, "498 HISTORY OF HOUSTON COUNTY. them, arrived fromJNorway, and secured claims on section eighteen, where two of them stdl remain. the valley and located on section twenty-two. His claim, as first located, was among the first on Port land Prairie. He has since gone the way of all the earth. The First Birth. \u2014 The first of these interest ing events of which we have any account, was Patrick Sheehan, a son of Michael Sheehan, who was born early in May, 1854. Louella Melvin, daughter of Joseph and Cordelia Melvin, was born on section thirty-two, near Eitzen Post-office, on the 7th of February, 1857. She is a grand daughter of Eliakim Laflin and Elvira, his wife, and is the esteemed wde of Mr. Frank Widis, of Caledonia. In 1854, Asa Sherman, a native of Rhode Island who had business relations with Mr. S. C. Perry, came and was afterwards drowned in the Missis sippi, as was believed at the time. S. C. Perry arrived at the same time, and he, with Mr. Sher man, pre-empted quite a large amount of land. After several years he left and is now supposed to be living in Iowa, David Salisbury, from Rhode Island, arrived in the fall of 1854; he remained for a time with Mr. Sherman, and finally bought him out. The First Death. \u2014 This was the case of old Mr. Spangler, in 1855, and he was buried on the bluff between the upper and lower mills. Soon after this the German element began to ar rive on the prairie. Among the first to appear were F. Monk, Wm. Schapper, F. Rhug, Herman Carston and others. In the north part of the town John and Jacob Meyus came about 1855, and they still remain and have good farms. In the fall of 1854, Thomas Barry, a brother-in-law of Patrick Walsh, bought the northeast of section twenty-five, and still remains. Walsh moved to Jefferson soon after the war. The First Marriage. \u2014 In the fall of 1854 or '55, Mr. Albert Leach and Mrs. Martha McDon ald were united in marriage at the house of Mr. E. D. Eaton, who was a Justice of the Peace of the first precinct of the county. EARLY ITEMS OF INTEREST. It is supposed that the first log house put up in the valley was by Jacob Tippery and his brother William, which was in 1853. It was placed near the upper mill on section twenty-three, where the cemetery now is, and near where there was at the time, a ford across the creek; it was sold as above mentioned, to Mr. Coe. Iu the spring of 1858, Peter McDonald lived in the house; he had two children, a son and a daughter, and that season the little boy was drowned in the spring branch near the house. He was buried near where Mr. Steel's granary now stands. This house was a source of considerable trouble afterwards, as it was sold to Mr. I. C. Calkins, who moved it to the prairie, a quarter of a mile east of Eitzen, and placed it across the road south of J. A. Melvin's. Of course this made Melvin indignant, to have his communications thus cut off, and the vendetta be gan in a modified corsican style. Calkins proceeded to build a barn which was burned on the 9th of May, 1864. Melvin was arrested as an incendiary and held to bad to answer before the grand jury, but this tribunal found no bid against him. Mel vin then proceeded against Calkins in a legal way and secured the arrest of him and his family, and he, securing a postponment of the case, took him self beyond the jurisdiction of the court, in May, 1865, and this practically ended the local war. Michael Sheehan and Timothy McCarthy came in the spring of 1854. They settled on sections six, seven, and sixteen, where they still dve. The Tippery brothers must have arrived in 1853. Their shanty was a little south of the residence of Thomas Barry. E. D. Eaton made a claim on section twenty-three which included the site of Barber's mill. During the season Oscar Boomer became a partner with Eaton, and the two laid out a town and called it Watertown. In the spring of 1855, the property was purchased by Wyman Trask, except about three blocks which were reserved. In the fall of 1855, Charles A. Coe came from Norway, Herkimer county, New York, and bought out the Tippery brothers. W. W. Doty also put in an appearance about the same time, and formed a partnership with Coe to build a saw-mill at Watertown. Coe and Doty went to New York State to procure the machinery. Trask got a large number of logs together in an ticipation of the mill. In the spring of 1856, the mill machinery was shipped to Brownsville, but some disagreement arising the mid was never set up here, but finady went to Rochester. Trask had to get his timber into rads and firewood. At an early day the Hanson brothers, five of The first blacksmith shop in town was started"], [513, "WINNEBAGO TO WNSIIIP. 499 by Mr. Thomas Biggs, a practical workman, who built a shop on the farm of Mr. J. A. Melvin on section thirty-two, in 1862, near Eitzen, and was carried on by him for several years. Mr. T. H. Templeton, in 1862 or '63, budt a shop on section twenty-five, but his fire only continued to burn about a year. The next man to erect a forge was Mr. B. J. Smith, in 1867, near the upper mill, who after hammering away awhile sold to Mr. Kemp, who still owns it. About the year 1870, Charles Vorpohl started a shop at Eitzen, and afterwards built a new shop and run it some time, then sold out to Wm. Freiburg, who still owns it, and has added a wagon shop. About 1876, Mr. T. Walsh started the shop now occupied by Mr. P. Cavin, near the lower mill. disposed of it to Mr. T. B. Barber, who added im provements to the extent of several thousand dol lars, and stid owns the property. These mdls are prominent factors in the prosperity of the whole vicinity. THE FIRST STORE. This was what would be called, in pioneer ver nacular, \"a one horse concern.\" It was located in the mill budding on section twenty-two, and was kept by Ensign McDonald. The next stock of merchandise to be opened up was in Semfer's building by Mr. Hilbert at Eit zen. About 1866, Mr. C. Bunge started a store in a log house. In 1873, H. F. Bucholz opened a store near Eitzen, but he was financiady sub merged in 1878, after a five years struggle. Pre vious to this, however, in 1866 or '67, W. R. Bal lou built a store near the upper Winnebago Mills, and rented it to Oleson & Co., two Norwegians, who run a grocery and dry goods store for two years, when they failed. MILLS. The first mill in the valley was what is called the upper mill, which was built of stone in the year 1860 and '61, by Ensign McDonald, but he sold it to McMillan & Rose before any machinery had been introduced. The new firm ljegan to put in machinery, but sold out to Serin <fc Lind burg about the year 1865, who finally\" got it into operation. The next year Sevin sold his share to Charles Johnson, and then, Lindburg dying, his widow sold her share to McMillan & Clark, and the firm became Johnson, McMillan & Clark. T. B. Barber, in 1874, erected a two-story budd ing near the lower mid, on section twenty-three, to be used for store purposes. TOWN ORGANIZATION. The first town meeting was held on the 11th of May, 1858, at the house of Mr. E. Laflin, on sec tion thirty-two, near where Mr. C. Bunge's store now stands. Mr. Laflin took the chair, and Mr. Freeman Graves, the senior resident, was elected moderator, and Asa P. Beman, clerk. A motion to proceed to the election of town officers prevaded. At ten minutes of ten o'clock, the pods opened, and they were kept open until five o'clock. The result of the balloting was as follows : Supervisors, Joseph A. Melvin, Chairman, Fred Kohlmeier, and Edmund Lynch; Clerk, Lovel Houghton; Asses sor, Lark E. Laflin; Collector, Harvey E. Jones; Overseer of the Poor, John Tourtelotte; Justices of the Peace, Asa P. Beman and Herman Carston; Constables, Frederick Ruhe and James H. Tem pleton ; Overseer of Roads, Freeman Graves. There must have been twenty-eight persons present as nearly all the candidates had twenty -seven votes each. A motion to have the next town meeting at Lovel Houghton's was carried. Soon after this three road districts were arranged by the town officers, and the following overseers appointed: Wyman Trask, Michael Sheehan, and Freeman Graves. Thus was the new town started on its ca- During the summer of 1877, the firm razed the old mdl to the ground, and enlarging the base ment, placed a two story frame building upon it, put in new and improved machinery, and in the fad of that year were again in operation. In the fall of 1878, the one-half of the mdl went into-the hands of J. Oiander, and the next fall it was sold to Olus Okerson, a Baptist clergyman, who, in the fall of 1880, sold his interest in the property to Charles Johnson, the present sole owner, whose abstract of title must have been a lengthy docu ment. The lower mill has a less eventful history. It is a stone structure, built in 1865 by Alexander and Davis Beck and George Cooper, the latter being a practical miller. After getting it in ope ration and running it awhile, Mr. Cooper left on the 6th of March, 1867, and the operation of the mill devolved upon Conrad Laufer and Mr. Mc- Millan, (Garrett Hurley was miller ten years) although stdl owned by the Beck brothers, who afterwards sold it to their brother-in-law, Martin Kearney.

The office was at first in the old log cabin, but transferred to the new store on his re moval into it. Winnebago Valley Post-office, \u2014 In 1858, an office was established on section twenty-two, called Winnebago Valley, which name it still re tains. James Langmuir was appointed Post master, and he first unlocked the mail pouch and distributed the contents to the eager people in the present house of August Wiegrefe. The mail was due once a week. Mr. Langmuir held the office until in 1874, Mr. Edward Stevens was ap pointed, and after having the office at his farm house a few months, Mr. T. B. Barber was ap pointed assistant, and the offiee removed to the store at the lower Winnebago Mid, where it has remained ever since. In the fall of 1881, two mails a week were received from New Albin. EITZEN. This is the name of a small and compact gath ering of buildings, including a store, hotel, and blacksmith shop, situated on Portland prairie, on the old wagon road between Spring Grove and New Albin, which, before the construction of the railroad, was very largely traveled. The name is in honor of Eitzen in Germany, from whence some of the early settlers came. Early Business. \u2014 Mr. Conrad Laufer had a farm house in 1865, and occasionally kept travel ers. This budding now does service as a barn. In 1867, Mr. Laufer opened a saloon and arranged to accommodate, in a more suitable way, his in creasing trade. That same year Mr. Charles Hil bert, of La Crosse, put in a small stock of general merchandise, but bankruptcy soon overtook him, and the goods went to auction in Caledonia- About the same time Mr. C. Bunge, Jr. procured a small stock of goods and displayed them in an old log cabin in which he had kept a bachelor's hall, it being the place where the first town meet ing was held. His success was such that he pur chased a larger building from Laufer, moved it across the street, procured a larger stock which his increasing business demanded, and he has kepit it up ever since. Wilmington Post-office. \u2014 The exact date of the establishment of the Portland Prairie Post office, as it was at first called, is, with the present available means of knowledge, a little obscure, but it must have been some time in 1855. Mr. Alex . Batchellor was appointed Postmaster, and Mr. David Salisbury, deputy; the office was at a farm house on section thirty m the township of Winnebago. In about a year Mr. Salisbury moved away, and he was succeeded by Mr. Sher man as deputy, who regularly attended to the business under Mr. Batchedor until Mr. J. G. Cook was regularly appointed Postmaster, when the offiee was moved to his residence in Wilming ton, on section twenty-five, and during this time the name was changed from Portland Prairie to Wilmington, which it still retains. In the year 1871, Mr. Laufer erected his present commodious hotel at a prime cost of $3,000 be sides the furniture. The building is a two-story frame, well painted and blinded, and presents a good appearance. It is 28x45 feet in size, but like many country taverns, which the railroads have superceded by whirling their passengers through other avenues, where meal places are at long dis tances apart, the patrons have diminished in num ber and may only be expected to again return as the country fids up within a certain radius. In 1863, Mr. R. E. Shumway received a com mission as Postmaster, and the office went to his residence on section thirty-six; here he remained four years, and then went to section twenty-five, and in 1868, he got on to section thirty in the town of Winnebago, across the street from Wil mington, and there it stdl remains. It will thus be seen that this Post-office has had quite an itin erant experience. In 1871, Mr. W. B. Johnson erected a hotel near the lower mill and managed it himself until 1874, when it was sold to Mr. T. B. Barber. SCHOOLS. District No. 49. \u2014 The first school district or ganized in town was No. 6. This was in 1857, and on the 31st of January, James Langmuir, Ja cob Tippery, and T. E.

The schoolhouse was built in 1859 and '60, on section twenty-three. When the ques tion of building a schoolhouse arose, the trouble began as to the location. Every member of the district of course wanted it near, but not too near, but after a few special meetings the site was fixed upon in the northwest quarter of section twenty three, where the school-house now stands.

When the county was first dis tricted this was designated as No. 51, and a school was opened in the house of Mr. F. Graves, which was taught by Miss Annie Johnson. This school held several terms, and in 1865 a school house was put up on the southwest quarter of section thirty five, where school was kept until 1873, when the district was merged into No. 52. The first school opened in District No. 52, Eit zen, was in the old Laflin log house, and was taught by Miss Lizzie Wildams, now Mrs. Eugene Marshall, of Caledonia. In 1866, a stone school house was erected in the center of section thirty two, near Eitzen. The first school in that build ing was taught by Miss J. C. Jones, now Mrs. E. Stevens, at $18 per month, and was commenced on the 12th of August, 1867. This house was subsequently burned, but was rebuilt and enlarged in 1875. District No. 86. \u2014 About the year 1874, this dis trict was set off from No. 52, and a schoolhouse put up the same year by a man who received $100 for laying up the stone work, the district furnish ing the material. Miss Annie Anderson was the first teacher. District No. 81. \u2014 This district was organized from a part of No. 49, on the 16th of August 1870. The first officers were: Wm.

District No. 50. \u2014 The first school in this dis trict was commenced in January, 1862, and was taught by Michael McNamara, for the not to be despised amount in those days, of $14 per month. The first schoolhouse was of logs and built in 1864, on section seventeen, but it was afterward moved to section seven, where it stood and did good service until the winter of 1876-77, when it was consumed by fire, and a new frame structure replaced it in the fall of 1877. RELIGIOUS. The first preaching of the gospel in the Winne bago Valley was in the year 1854, by Rev. Leon ard Sharp, who was a Campbellite, and at the time was living on section thn-ty in the town of Jefferson. In January, 1856, he was kided by a fading tree. In relation to the organization of the schools it may here be remarked that the State legislature, in 1861, provided that every township should be a school district, to be subdivided according to local requirements, and in accordance with this plan Winnebago was made into four districts, and num bered accordingly. The next year, or the year fol lowing, the law was changed, requiring the county to arrange the school district, giving them con secutive numbers, regardless of town lines. Methodist. \u2014 This denomination first became interested here in 1858, when the conference be gan to treat the place as a promising missionary field, and furnished a supply from Caledonia, the meetings being held in the residence of James Langmuir, who lived on section twenty-two. Ser vices were thus kept up with more or less regular ity untd the building of the schoolhouse in 1860, when this was occupied, and a Sunday school was started by the Rev. N. Taintor, who at the time was stationed in Caledonia with this as an outly ing charge. In 1866, the first regular class meet ing was organized with thirteen members, and Mr. E. Stevens as Leader. These meetings, with preaching every two weeks, and a Sunday school every week, were kept up untd 1879, when the The new allotment gave No. 1, the No. of 49; No 4, became No. 50; No. 2, became No. 51; and No. 3 was transformed into No. 52.

J. H. White was a prominent worker at one time, and the last one was Rev. W. M. Bowdish. Evangelical Lutheran Immanuel Church. \u2014 On the 23d of July, 1866, a portion of the old con gregation held a meeting in the church and re solved upon a separation, and the following year a small church was built on a five acre lot purchased from Mr. C. Bunge, where the society held meet ings until it became too contracted, when it was enlarged, and soon after another addition was made, into which the minister with his family moved. A school is usually kept in the building for about eight months in the year, generally taught by the pastor. Rev. Ludwig Ebert was the first minister to occupy the sacred desk, and there were several others before the present pas tor, Rev. Adolph Niedergesass. A cemetery is also connected with this church. The German Lutheran Church. \u2014 The earliest meetings were held in the interest of this denomi nation about the year 1859, at the house of Fred erick Kohlmeir on section thirty-one, by Rev. Muckwitz, a missionary. Meetings were occa sionally held in private houses and finally in the schoolhouse, in district No. 59, in Wdmington, where they were kept up for several years. In 1863, the field having been sufficiently cultivated, a union meeting was called at the house of Henry Deters, on the Iowa side of the dne, and an organ ization was effected, which is now known as \" The St. Johns United Evangelical Church.\" In 1864, the church was erected on this side of the line, on section thirty-two, at a cost of about $800. The building was at first utilized on the upper floor as a parsonage, and the ground floor as a meeting and school room. This was the first rehgious ed ifice in town, and in it all seemed to unite in the advancement of Christianity for the common good. Meetings were continued up to 1874, when the present commodious church was built, at a cost of about $2,700, and with a seating capacity of about 500. In size it is 30x50 feet, and has a spire, in the belfry of which is a bell weighing 1,112 pounds, whose peals summon large congre gations from mdes around. The church has a gadery to increase its seating capacity. The membership is well up to 200. In connection with this church is a school which was estabhshed about the time the first building wss erected. When the second church was built a separate schoolhouse was put up between the two, and in this a school has been kept several months each year, usuady by the resident minister. Zion Evangelical Lutheran. \u2014 This society was organized in 1871, and a church budding was erected the same year on a lot procured of Mr. C. Laufer, on the northeast of the southwest of sec tion thirty-two; it has no architectural preten sions and cost not over $800. This society was brought into existence by Rev. Fred Zeifert, of Wabasha county, Minnesota, who remained for two years, and was followed by Rev. C. Boettcher. For several years the supply has been by Rev. Carl Gutknecht, who officiates once in two weeks. There were originady about eighteen members in cluded in this departure, and the number is said not to have increased. There is also a cemetery connected with this church. It is understood that the first interment was that of an infant child of Wm. Overman, whose parents live near the line in Iowa. During the winter months a school is usually held in an addition to the \"church. If the Luth erans were united and consolidated, they would have a powerful church. A cemetery, in accordance with European usage, was established in the church yard, which contained five acres. The first burial there being John Linde, aged four months and twenty -three days. The little pilgrim's parents stid reside in town. Methodist Episcopal. \u2014 As already stated, this denomination was early in the field, in an other part of the town from where the present edifice is located. It seems that Mr. Cramer met a Methodist minister on a Mississippi steamer, and requested him to see Mr. Hobart, the Presid ing Elder, and have him send a minister down to this region; and the Elder learning, in this way, that there were some Methodists near the State line south of Caledonia, sent down an appoint ment by Bro. Ransom Scott, an exhorter who had already held a meeting there, and so on the 1st of December, 1855, Rev. Mr. Hooper arrived there The whole number of interments here up to the fad of 1881, was seventy-seven. The present pastor of the church is Rev. John Jahn.

George and Ellen Cass gave to the society a deed conveying a lot. A budding committee was appointed, consisting of F. Healey, Henry Robinson, George Cass, and E. L. Arnold, with Mr. Cass as treasurer. The subscription after wards got up to $1,540; Mr. J. McNelly procured a plan from St. Paul. The contract was let to Mr. Tuttle, of New Albin, and such commend able expedition followed that the building was completed the following June. The church has a spire, and the windows have blinds. The build ing is in every way neat and tasty, and is a credit to the little Methodist community. The society is still associated with Caledonia, and Rev. C. A. Bunce is the pastor. At the second appointment a class was formed, composed of the following persons : Mr. and Mrs. Peter Paige, Mr. and Mrs. J. McNelly, Mr. and Mrs. A. Gdbert, Mr. and Mrs. Albert Green, Sarah Albee, and Mr. Cramer. J. McNelly was desig nated Leader. These pioneer meetings were described as most remarkable, producing a profound effect upon the audiences, which was manifested in various ways. Soon after this a sad affair occurred, the fud horrors of which were not realized for months afterwards. It was on the 9th of December that Ransom Scott, the exhorter above mentioned, went to Portland Prairie to have a meeting, and, not withstanding the snow which was on the ground, and still falling in a boisterous storm, he persisted in attempting to return, contrary to the urgent advice of his friends. He lived with Mr. Young, near North Ridge, an uncle of his about eight miles away. That he did not return for several days caused no apprehension, on account of the character of the traveling. Soon, however, the facts became known, and a careful search was in stituted, but not a single trace discovered. The next May his remains were found scattered about in a ravine, two miles beyond his home. The wolves had devoured him, excepting a part of his feet, which, encased in his boots, the ravenous beasts coidd not penetrate; only a few shreds of clothing remained. His skull -was some distance away. His bible, hymn book, pocket book, watch, and pocket knife were also found. Possibly he was attacked by the wolves, but the probabil ity is that he perished in the snow, and his body being found, they proceeded to appease their ap petites. He was a promising young man, twenty six years of age, and was from New York State. Baptist Society. \u2014 A Baptist organization was effected in 1866, by some of the Swedes and Nor wegians. Rev. A.

Enoch Gould was the first man in the north part of the town, in the Root River valley. He was a native of New Hampshire, and first came west to Fox Lake, Wisconsin, and thence to Yu catan in 1855. His family joined him a year or two later. He took 400 acres of land in sections thirty-three and thirty-four. At first he lived where D. R. Chisholm's place now is. He secured a Post-office on section thirty-three, called Hamil ton, which afterwards gave the name to the town that was finally re-named Money Creek. In the spring of 1856, when the town site fever was epidemic throughout this region, he put up another log house on the open land north of his other location, near where Mrs. Van Sickles now lives, and platted a town of forty acres, north of the road in the southeast of the southeast quarter of section fourteen, and gave it the name of Yu catan. Whether he had a priority of invention in the \"isothermal line\" business, and supposed he could iuduce immigrants to believe that the cli mate was semi-tropical, is not known. At all events, the result of his enterprise was that during the summer the city had five log buildings erected, and reached the pinnacle of its glory. A mid-dam was completed and a saw-mdl com menced. Dr. T. A. Pope, in the spring of 1856, reported in person and made a claim in section thirteen, where H. Persons now is. The Doctor originated in Chautauqua county, New York, and had dved a short time on Pope's prairie, south of Caledonia. In 1856, he procured the establishment of a Post office, and it is now the Yucatan office. The name of the town at one time was Utica. Dr. Pope was the first Postmaster, practiced medicine and open ed up a farm, and was the first Town Clerk, hold ing the position several years. He finall/ removed to Sheldon in 1860 or '61, and taught school about two years, when he returned to his place, but soon removed to Houston, after selling his farm, and there engaged in the practice of his profession until a few years since, when he went to Iowa and still resides there. In September, 1855, Mr. Stevens transferred his right, title, and interest here to Peter Larr and Hiram Howe, and removed to Worth county, Iowa, where he lived some years and then went to Puget Sound, Washington Territory. Mr. E. Maek intire, who had been a railroad contractor, from from Dedham, Massachusetts, came here in the summer of 1855, and took a claim on section thirty-three, where H. Carrier now lives. Peter Larr came in the summer of 1856, and dropped on the place now occupied by Fadis Knox. He hailed from Missouri, where he was bom on the 19th of December, 1842. He first went to Iowa and then to Wisconsin, and from there came here. In 1866, he sold the place on sections fourteen and twenty-three, and moved up the val ley, and a few years later he bought the place where he now lives, on sections twenty-six and twenty-seven. In 1856 Mr. Larr and H. Howe bought out Stevens, including the mid property, and the town site, and he still lives on the same section. Mr. Mackintire was an enterprising man and se cured the estabhshment of a Post-office which was called Dedham. He was the first representative from this district in the State legislature, and his son, S. B. Mclntire, was the first cadet to West Point, appointed from this congressional district. Mr. Mackintire afterwards removed to Houston, where he has since lived. In company with a Mr. Cooper, he built a mill and had it running in 1856. It had one run of stones and a long bolt turned, out eight bushels an hour, and was driven by a re action wheel. Soon after, a run of stones for feed was put in. In 1859, an addition was made to the mid, in which a still was placed to make whisky from the corn obtained as toll in the grist-mill; the still had a capacity of 100 gallons a day. In 1861, Mr. Mackintire sold out to L. Lynch, Mr. On the 18th of April, 1856, John and H. Colby, two brothers from Erie county, New York, arrived and secured a place on section twenty-two, where Benjamin Bidwell now lives. These brothers re mained here about eight years. H.

John Colby, after disposing of his share of the property mentioned above, moved to what is known as Oak Ridge, and bought 120 acres on section nine. In 1865, Ur dix Colby, his brother, joined him in September, and opened a shoe shop near Howe's saw-mill. He has since dved in Fillmore county and in Houston, but now owns a farm on section twenty seven, where he now resides. Marriage. \u2014In the fall of 1857, Wildam King and Martha M.

The whole number buried there is fourteen, including two re movals, Mr. Enos Adams and Mr. Joseph Barton. In the new cemetery, on sections twenty-seven and twenty- eight, the first interment was that of Eu gene Bidwell, in September, 1873. In the spring of 1853 or '54, Asa Comstock se cured a claim in section twenty-seven but did not locate on it until the spring of 1856, when he bought other large tracts; after about fifteen years he went to Missouri. manufacturing. Edwin Stevens built a dam across the South Fork of Root River, on section twenty-three, where the Howe mid now is, in the summer of 1856, and commenced the construction of a saw mdl. Before it was completed he sold the estab lishment to H. Howe, with the understanding that it should be finished according to certain specifi cations, but when the property was delivered it proved unsatisfactory, and the wheel was removed and numerous other changes made before it met the views of its new owner. The spot on which this mill stood is near the present grist-mill. It was a vertical sash saw, and its reciprocating mo tion was kept up, manufacturing lumber untd 1871, when the grist- mdl was erected. James Kelly, one of the influential aud promi nent mentof Yucatan, came here from Brownsville, in April, 1856, and took 280 acres on section twen ty-nine. He built a house, and opened up a farm which he left in charge of his father, Hugh Kedy, and went to work at the carpenter's trade in Rush ford, which he continued until the fall of 1859, when he returned to his farm to remain. His father died at the age of 82 years, on the 5th of January, 1871, and his mother at the age of 85 years, on the 18th of July, 1874. Robert Earl was the first to locate on Oak Ridge, about the year 1858. In 1865, he sold to Mr. Colby. Soon after him came Wm. Mahaffery, who stopped on section seven. He was from Delaware. A few years ago he removed to Rushford. Lawrence Lynch did not arrive till about 1860, when he bargained for the Dedham Mill and Dis tillery, which he subsequently lost in the August flood of 1866. He was an early settler in the county, and it is related that while prospecting about he came across a tree that had just been felled bv the beavers, and he concluded, by the way it was hacked around on ad sides, that it must have been done by an Irishman who had never cut a tree in the old country, so he sat down and remained some time waiting for him to return. The First Birth.\u2014 This is said to have been James C. Kedy, son of James Kelly who was born on the 28th of October, 1857, although there The first grist-mid was that already mentioned on section thirty-three on Riceford Creek, and was called the Dedham Mid. It was a frame building 20x30 feet, and did a large amount of custom work. Mr. Watkins soon bought out Mr. Cooper, and Mr. Lynch bought out Mr. Mackintire in 1860. and in August, 1866, it was swept away by that flood, and has never been replaced. The Howe Mill \u2014 Is on the South Fork in section twenty-three, and was erected by E. B. Howe, having been commenced in the fad of 1870, and completed in the spring of 1871. It has a head of water of seven feet, and two turbine wheels, rated at twenty-five horse-power each, keep the machinery in motion.

It is run by a turbine wheel of twenty horse-power, under a pressure of twenty feet, but the water supply is only sufficient for a single run of stones for ten hours a day. The mill, however, contains two run of stones, a smutter, bolt, cornsheller, etc., and can grind five bushels of wheat an hour.

Miss Agnes Mcln nis had the honor of calling the first school to order. District No. 18. \u2014 In 1867, a tax was levied after a new district had been organized, and a log house was got together, 18x24 feet, and a school started with Mrs. Gale as instructor.
