Also, in consideration of their valorous deeds at the fatal field of Flodden, he granted to the townsmen of Selkirk large gifts of land and wood, that they might rebuild their ancient capital, which the vengeance of the English victors had so completely destroyed. Thus, by cutting down the trees for fuel and building pur poses, the needy lords and lairds helped to fill their empty purses, and also hasten that time when the \"derke forest\" should be little more than a hoary Bravery of tradition.

They also served faithfully and well under the noble Lords of Douglas; and when that great House forfeited the lordship of the Forest, they fought no less faithfully, and fell as bravely, for the unfortunate James at Flodden Field. The social state of the people in those early bygone days was of the most elementary order. The houses were poor \u2014 built of wood, straw, and clay. A few cottagers owned in common the im plements to till their small holdings. Rents were chiefly paid in kind, or by personal service. The fields were undrained and unfenced. The lumbering wooden plough, drawn by six or eight oxen, was used till the end of last century. The unsettled state of the whole Border country killed all progress. Not till the close of the civil wars were the valleys opened up to the rapidly advancing spirit of im provement. After the Union an extensive cattle trade sprang up with England, and with it the modern commercial period began. At the beginning of this century it was common to see a driver going before his horses with a spade in his hands to fill up the ruts, so bad were the roads ; to-day they are so excellent that one can cycle the distance from Selkirk to Moffat on a good track.

The hills are lofty, but lack the variety of North and West Highland scenery. They are not precipitous, convulsed, awesome heights; but high, rounded summits of per sistent, if not at times monotonous, green. In few places are they relieved by the fantastic forms and changing colours of rent and jagged rocks, or by a generous growth of foxglove and bracken ; yet the eye that scans them when clad in the purple glory of heather bloom, suffused by the mellow radiance of the setting sun, will readily forget that they are not sufficiently high and rugged to be either grand or sublime. On my first drive up Ettrick I sat next to a meditative youth from Edinburgh, and opposite a typical American who was \" doing \" this country. As we came in sight of the stern and bold old heights that guard the secrecy of the vale, my meditative neighbour audibly remarked \u2014 \"How clear, how keen, how marvellously bright, The effluence from yon distant mountain's head ! ' \"Ah,\" said the American, with a true Yankee drawl. \" Call that a mountain ? Our boys could play leap-frog over that. Guess you should see the Alleghanies.\" Sir Walter Scott's reply to Washington Irving might have done him good. Irving came to see Scott at Abbotsford in August of 1817. He gazed about with surprise, almost with disappointment. \" I beheld a mere succession of grey waving hills, line upon line, so far as my eye could reach, monot onous in their aspect, and so destitute of trees that"], [23, "INTRODUCTION. 5 one could almost see a stout fly walking along their profile ; and the far-famed Tweed appeared a naked stream, flowing between bare hills, without a tree or thicket on its banks ; and yet such had been the magic web of poetry and romance thrown over the whole, that it had a greater charm for me than the richest scenery I had beheld in England. I could not help giving utterance to my thoughts. Scott hummed for a moment to himself, and looked grave. He had no idea of having his muse complimented at the expense of his native hills. ' It may be Scott's love pertinacity,' said he at length, ' but to my eye these r'J.'.?\"\" grey hills, and all this wide Border country, have beauties peculiar to themselves. I like the very nakedness of the land ; it has something bold and stern and solitary about it.

Yarrow has a peculiar fascination in the quiet unobtrusive charm of its green undulating hills and \"dowie dens\" through which flows its classic stream. In addition to its natural beauty, Scott, Hogg, Wordsworth, Christopher North, and a host of nameless minstrels have hallowed its fairy and brownie haunted glades with countless associations of romantic love and heroic adventure. Yarrow's charm is not that of overhanging cliff, overshadow ing mountain, or forest mystery ; but of pastoral sweetness linked to story, tradition, ballad, and song. The ripple and flow of its silver streams and the intense quiet of its \" dowie houms \" still stir to thoughts that breathe and words that burn. It was this charm, and the inspiration of a poetic past, that impelled Walter Scott and James Hogg to make their first literary efforts the collection of its min strelsy. Surely no earthly task could have been more to a poet's taste; for every glen has its ruined tower, famous for tales of maidens' fears and warriors' strife. Sir Walter Scott, in his ' Marmion,' has made the English speaking world familiar with the country lying near St Mary's Loch \u2014 rich in memories of medi\u00e6val piety, chivalry, and romance, as well as in thrilling incidents of a later time.

Sir Walter Scott followed the leading of a true poetic sense when he chose a tower of such romantic memories as the scene where the last and most beloved of all the minstrels should sing his incomparable lay \u2014 for which Newark is now chiefly celebrated. ' The Lay of the Last Minstrel ' Nor are the birchen bowers opposite Newark without their story ; for here, in mute simplicity, is the ruined cottage in which was born that famous traveller, Mungo Park, who gave the world almost the first of those fascinating tales of personal ex plorations into the heart of the Dark Continent.

Selkirk, anywhere beyond its own marches, is most famed as the town in which Sir Walter Scott for thirty-two years dispensed justice in the capacity of \" Shirra,\" and where Mungo Park, the renowned African traveller, began life as a country doctor.

Built on the steep hillside, overlooking the Ettrick on its south bank, the situa tion is unsurpassed ; and when seen from the direc tion of Yarrow, with the spires and turrets of church and courthouse, and red sandstone villas rising among poplar, ash, and beech trees, the impression is one of approach to some ancient Italian town. Wrhen David I. ascended the throne in 1124, he speaks of the place as an \" old town.\" From him the burgh received its first charter, and, when Prince of Cumbria, he founded a Tironensian abbey near the royal castle of Selkirk.

The hamlets which rose around these two import ant centres were respectively known as Selkirk Regis and Selkirk Abbatis. The monks, however, for some unknown reason petitioned to have their monastery removed to Kelso, which removal was effected in 1126, when the twofold distinction passed away \u2014 Selkirk surviving for both as the sole designation. The derivation is a subject of some uncertainty. The oldest received spelling is Schele chyrch (the kirk of the shiels), thus referring to the nature of the hamlet that sprang up around the hunting seat of the early Scottish kings. Others, again, find in the name a reference to the castle itself, and give the spelling, Sel (great), or Sele (hill, or prince's court), and chelyve (church) ; while not a few accept the etymology given by Sir James Dalrymple, who derives the word from the Celtic schelch and grech (kirk in the wood). No traces can now be found of its great antiquity. At one time it was surrounded by an extensive wall, the building of which, we are told, was a task that took the monks thirteen years to complete ; but for over a century there has been no visible proof of their toil. These ecclesiastics have left a surer guarantee of their presence in the repre sentation of the virgin and child now adopted in the town's coat of arms. A zealous Protestantism has accounted for these in a manner more creditable to its faith than to its veracity. The touching little story runs thus: \u2014 \"At the time of the field of Flodden there was one of the burghers' wives went out with a child, thinking long for her husband, and was found dead at the root of a tree, and the child sucking her breast, on the edge of the rising"], [29, "SELKIRK. 11 ground belonging to the town, which is called 'Lady- wood Edge ' since that time to this day.\" The castle of Selkirk was for long the centre of southern statecraft ; while in the church of the town, near the end of the thirteenth century, Sir 13th William Wallace was proclaimed Overlord of Scot- Cmtufy- land. Though the inhabitants were men of a William peaceful avocation, the exigencies of the time Wallace- compelled them to practise the art of war, and as fighting men they enjoyed a certain high repute. At the battle of Falkirk they had fought bravely Souters at under Wallace, and report has it that at least 7^7' eighty of them, under the leadership of William Brydon, the town-clerk, marched to the ill-fated field of Flodden. Few \u2014 according to the MSS. of Hodge, Flodden only one of these, the town-clerk, survived, bringing frjj back with him an English banner as a proof and token of his comrades' and of his own bravery. The flag was for long the cherished property of the Weavers' Corporation, and latterly came into the custody of J. B. Selkirk, the only surviving member of that body, whose poems and prose writings on Ettrick Forest have gained him a well-deserved popularity.

This farm is interesting as con taining one of the few antiquities of the valley, the vestiges of a strong entrenchment, called the Moat of Howden.

The Howden Burn, curving round it on the south, and a broad moss or syke (now drained) lying along its northern base, might, by a little judicious damming, be deepened and made impassable. It is not easy to say, with any degree of confidence, what were the precise uses of Howden Moat. A short distance from Howden, and across the river, on the tongue of land formed by the junction of the Ettrick and the Yarrow, is Carterhaugh, celebrated as the scene of the well-known fairy ballad of ' Tamlane.'

The ballad is certainly an old one, and unsurpassed among the supernatural poems of the Border. Some of its features remind of the widely diffused European fairy ballad ; but its feeling is peculiarly Scotch, and embodies the popular beliefs of the district in which it is localised, even up till late years. Briefly, the argument of the ballad is : \u2014 Tamlane, who in the sequel reveals his identity, is a son of Randolph, Earl of Murray; and at the age of nine, while on a visit to his uncle at Oakwood Tower, by fairy enchantment is spirited away to the elfin kingdom.

Tamlane fears that, when the tithe is due, he will be the victim. He instructs Janet how to rescue him on the only possible night, Hallowe'en. So great is her love that she effects his deliverance, which event is described in a powerful manner. Professor Veitch thus moralises on the old story : \" Possibly it may point to the struggle, often found so hard, with the repulsive shapes by which the powers of evil are ever ready to interpose between us and what may be our highest good. There is a fine lesson of courage, and faith, and self-sacrifice even for us in the old mythic fairy creed.\" The only other thing for which Carterhaugh is celebrated, save its proximity to Philiphaugh, is a famous football match played there between picked men from Selkirk and Yarrow, on December 15th, 1815, under the patronage of the Duke of Buccleuch and Lord Home.

Here he enclosed about 300 acres, for the purpose of ascertaining what growths were indigenous to the ancient forest. In 1878 the Rev. Dr Farquharson, minister of Selkirk Parish Church, read before the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club an interesting paper embodying the results of a careful investigation made by him on the enclosed grounds after 50 years natural growth. He says in con clusion: \"The lesson I draw from the Howebottom experiment is that in the old Forest of Ettrick there was not a stately and uniform growth of large timber.

Howford, the property of the Duke of Buccleuch, is situated opposite on the right bank of the river, and the farm-house beyond, at the foot of Howford Hill (1012), is Helmburn, now in the hands of the trustees of the late William Brown of Galahill, whose father purchased it in 1849 for -\u00a3\"4750. A foot-bridge recently thrown across the stream forms a convenient way for getting to Brockhill ; and, some two hundred yards further on, a substantial bridge crosses the river, and brings the traveller to the village of Ettrickbridgend. The view from the bridge, upwards and downwards, takes in a remark ably pretty bit of the stream, which should not be missed by any tourist. Dr Russell relates that the Ettrick Shepherd told him the first bridge over the Ettrick was built by Auld Wat of Harden, when he resided at Kirkhope Tower. He also says: \"The old bridge which stood"], [55, "UP ETTRICK TO TUSHIELA W 33 The Parish Church. Parish of Kirkhope. about a stone's-cast above the present one, had a stone in it with the Harden coat of arms, viz., a crescent moon, with the motto, Cornua reparabit Ph\u0153be, in allusion to the frequent raids by moonlight. When the present bridge was erected, and still more recently, when it was widened and repaired, the stone was transferred to the building, where it may still be seen.\" Ettrickbridgend is a hamlet 7 miles from Selkirk, and has about 120 inhabitants, a parish church, board school, police station, and an inn. The river below the village is strictly preserved, but the upper reaches are open to fishers, and Ettrickbridgend is the natural camping ground for those who wish to fish the parts stretching up to Tushielaw. The parish church was built in 1839 by the fifth Duke of Buccleuch for the convenience of the outlying portions of the parishes of Ettrick and Yarrow ; and the Rev. James Russell, afterwards the pastor of Yarrow, and the genial author of the ' Reminis- cences,' was chosen to be the first minister. In 1852 the area now known as Kirkhope was dis joined from Yarrow, and erected into a separate parish. Its first minister was the Rev. John S. Gibson, M.A., son of Mr Gibson, Shaws, on whose death the Rev. Hugh Macmillan, his assistant, was elected to the charge. Above the bridge the Ettrick is seen pursuing its way between precipitous and thickly wooded banks, where the cliffs are covered with a growth of bracken and foxglove to the water's edge. On a beautiful situation at the head of the village stands the Estab lished Church Manse. From the elevated platform on which it is situated, and also from the highway c"], [56, "ETTRICK AND YARROW. 34 a little beyond the house, there is a fine view of Newhouse Linns, at the bottom of which is the chasm known in fishers' parlance as the \" Loup,\" where, in the winter season, many a fine fish is caught\u2014 without the aid of fly. T. Craig -Brown reminds us that here, in the autumn of 1831, and a few weeks before he left Abbotsford for the Con tinent, Sir Walter Scott paid his last visit to the Forest.

The theory, as quoted by Craig- Brown, is that this barrier of rock dammed back the river for ages, thus forming a lake for miles up the valley. Originally, the outlet was by an old channel running below the Tower of Kirkhope, but not being large enough to contain the river when in flood the lake overflowed at this barrier, and in the course of problematic ages made the gully for itself which now contains the whole stream. Mr Craig-Brown himself suggests that the new channel may have been made by a receding waterfall, and instances the canons of America as examples, and Niagara in particular.

The solitary, defiant old ruin is in excellent preservation, stands 71 feet in height, 48 feet in length of wall, and is 23 feet in breadth. There is now no trace of its mill, though it pos sessed such ; and as the name suggests, this small vale within a vale was once the site of a chapel, probably, along with those of Buccleuch and Deuchar, subsidiary to the church of St Mary's. There is no indication of its exact position, and even the oldest charters bear no traces of its history. When, in 1852, a parish was constituted out of the ancient lands included in Buccleuch, and joined to Ettrick in 1650, this small vale furnished it with a name. A little beyond the Linns is Kirkhope farm steading and cottages. At this point a road leads over Kershope Swire to the Yarrow valley, the distance being about three miles. Following the river's course, a suspension bridge crosses the Ettrick leading to the residential estate of Shaws, the property of Dr Thomas Anderson, grandson of the late Dr Thomas Anderson of Selkirk. This residence, the style of which is unique, forms a striking object in the landscape. Further east is the farm of Ettrick Shaws. Part of the estate is known as Gildiesgreen, reminis cent of a time when the whole was known as Guildhouse, which, in its turn, was superseded by Bailielees \u2014 so called, as Mr Craig-Brown thinks, from being possessed by Cranston of Cranston, \"Bailie of the Forest of Ettrick\" in 1467.

These seem to point to a period when this part of the country was a con tinuous chain of lochs. Most of them contain a large deposit of shell marl, which in some cases has been used advantageously for agricultural purposes. On the Mid Hill, overlooking the Shaws under loch, stood a fine example of the round tumulus, known as \"The Sleepy Knowe.\" A short distance above the suspension bridge, on the left bank of the river, sheltered by a clump of oak trees, is Singlie farmhouse, owned by the Duke of Buccleuch. James Hogg, when a lad, served for a time with Mr Scott at Singlie. Some distance farther up, on the opposite side, is the farm of Hyndhope, said to have been at one time a favourite rendezvous for hunting parties. It has had some distinguished owners. In 1621 Alexander, Earl of Home, was succeeded by his son, James, as owner of Hyndhope. Toward the end of the 17th century it became the property of the Rev. Alexander Cuningham, minister of Ettrick, a descendant of the Earls of Glencairn. Colonel Charles Cuningham, son of the last laird Cuningham, was a favourite aide-de-camp of the Iron Duke. Hyndhope is now owned by J. T. Mercer, Esq. of Scotsbank. The present tenant, Mr Adam Brown, has contrived to lay out links on his land, where he and his golfing friends may in dulge in the ancient pastime.

Here the Captain of Bewcastle re lieved Jamie Telfer of his kye, and drove them off to England. Jamie soon called together a party of his friends, who pursued the Englishmen up the Teviot, and overtook them beyond the Frostlee Burn. There is a short, fierce fight vividly de scribed in the ballad, in which the Scots not only win the day, but follow up their victory by raiding the home of the English captain so successfully that\u2014 ' When they cam to the fair Dodhead, They were a wellcum sight to see !

The power and truth of individual manhood were never more thor oughly tested than in the wild grips of a Border raid.\" It is only fair to state that the locality has been disputed ; some inclining to the opinion that the Dodhead mentioned is near Skelfhill, on the south side of Teviot, where Telfer was within three miles of Stobs, his feudal protector, who treated him so scurrilously ; whereas in the former case he would be twenty-five miles away.

In Celtic, dal means a portion, while Orran is the name of a Celtic saint ; and some hold that it is quite probable this saint may have lent his name in some way to the locality. The local pronunciation lends some colour to this theory, for the natives always pronounce it Deldrran. The accent on the last syllable is solely due to the refer ence in the ' Lay of the Last Minstrel,' where Scott rhymes Deloraine with again in the couplet \u2014 I'd give the lands of Deloraine, Dark Musgrave were alive again.\" Sir Walter Scott says: \u2014 The lands of Deloraine were immemorably possessed by the Buccleuch family under the strong title of occupancy, although no charter was obtained from the Crown until 1545. Easter Deloraine is now tenanted by a family of Bostons, who claim relationship with the celebrated Thomas Boston, minister of Ettrick Kirk. Formerly, the front of the house faced towards the summit of the hill behind, but a few years ago, when the place was rebuilt and enlarged, the frontage was made towards the river. Wester Deloraine has been tenanted for gener ations by a family of Scotts, and it is interesting to note that Henry Scott Riddell, the author of \" Scotland yet,\" and many other deservedly popular songs, and latterly minister of Teviothead, was for two years a shepherd on this farm.

A short distance above Gilmanscleuch, close by the road, is Ladyside School, under the mastership of Mr Thomas Elliot, while some distance beyond that again stands the farm-steading of Newburgh. Half a mile west of this is Gowdieknowe, formerly a police station, but vacated recently, on a new station being erected at Hopehouse, further up the valley. Passing Crosslee, a cosy- looking farmhouse, a road striking to the right, and leading from Ettrick into Yarrow, is the route followed by the coach in its circular tour up the one valley and down the other. Newburgh and Crosslee were originally one farm, known as Winterburgh, the farmer of which, Simon Scott, gave his son Arthur so good an educa tion that he was commonly called \"Mr\" \u2014 a title then given only to men of learning. This Mr Arthur, in 1590, is styled of Winterburgh, and again, in 1603, of Newburgh. Mr Craig-Brown suggests, as a possible explanation of this, that his cultured taste may have led him to dislike the gloomy name of Winterburgh. Mr Arthur Scott was, however, no mere bookworm, as may be guessed from the fact that he was one of the rescuers of Kinmont Willie from Carlisle Castle. There is no evidence of the time and circumstances in which part of Winterburgh was named Crosslee : but Craig-Brown says, \" We are inclined to think Crosslee an ancient name of part of the estate, connected in some way with an ancient cross which appears to have stood in this locality.

At Tushielaw farm-steading, on the way up the valley, there is an extensive rookery, and a little further on stands the Free Church and the recently erected manse. The church was built in 1879, and the minister is the Rev. Robert Birkett, who was ordained to this charge in 1880. Tushielaw Inn is but a stone-cast from the church, and is much resorted to by those fishing the upper reaches of the river. It lies 15 miles south-west of Selkirk. From the Inn door, looking west, the ruins of the ancient Tushielaw Tower, famed in historical record, tradition, and song, can be seen standing on a bare ridge of the Tushie Law (1431). From this stronghold Adam Scott, who gloried in the soubri quet \" King of thieves,\" sallied out with his reiving companions to harry some Cumberland keep, or punish a Border neighbour who refused payment of blackmail. His marauding career was cut short by James V., when, in his expedition of 1529, he suddenly presented himself before the tower and commanded Scott to surrender himself to justice. After a short but stubborn resistance he was over come by the King's forces, seized, and, according to tradition, instantly hanged on the branch of an ash tree near the gateway of his tower. If you are driving up Ettrick by coach the accommodating driver will point out a solitary, gnarled, weather beaten old ash, on the hill side not far from the ruins, as the \" identical tree on which Scott was hanged.\" Of course, the driver was not there; and"], [64, "ETTRICK AND YARROW. 42 A sugges tive guide story. History versus 'Tradition it may be well to remember here a story told by Scott in the notes to ' The Abbot.' A friend stood on the battlefield of Killiecrankie looking at one of those rugged pillars of rough stone which indicate the scenes of ancient conflict. A Highland shepherd hurried forward and offered his services as cicerone, and proceeded to inform him that Dundee was slain at that stone, which was raised to his memory. \"Fie, Donald,\" answered my friend, \"how can you tell such a story to a stranger? I am sure you know well enough that Dundee was killed at a considerable distance from this place, near the house of Fascally, and that this stone was here long before the battle in 1688.\" \"Oich! oich!\" said Donald, no way abashed, \" and your honour's in the right, and I see you ken a' aboot it. And he wasna killed on the spot neither, but lived till the next morning ; but a' the Saxon gentlemen like best to hear he was killed at the great stone.\" Tradition still further preserves for us the assur ance that the ash tree on which Scott was himself hanged had many nicks along its principal branches, formed by the ropes with which the freebooter had suspended many an unhappy victim. Professor Veitch suggests that these ominous notches, along with the blackmail levy, may account for the fact that the death of so prominent a man did not call forth any poetic commemoration. But there was a ballad on the event, lines of which were known both to Scott and Laidlaw; yet the whole was never re covered. Unfortunately for tradition's truthfulness in this instance, Pitcairn, in his 'Criminal Trials,' records that Adam Scott was convicted in Edin burgh on the 18th of May 1530, \"of art and part"], [65, "UP ETTRICK TO TUSHIELA W. 43 of the theftuously taking blackmail, from the time of his entry within the castle of Edinburgh, in word from John Browne, in Hoprow ; and for art and part of theftuously taking of blackmail from Andrew Thorbrand and William, his brother ; also from the poor tenants of Hopcailzow ; and of art and part of theftuously taking blackmail from the tenants of Eschescheill.\" The ominous and suggestive sequel to the whole case is contained in one word which follows the above statement \u2014 \"Beheaded.\" Judg ing from the splendid situation and the huge lumps Once a of wall lying about, the tower in its best days must $\u00a3\u00b0\"fr have been both large and strong. Tradition says, that when James had captured Adam Scott, his men tried to overthrow the tower ; but, so strong were the walls, they only succeeded in making small gaps in the masonry. The first mention made of Tushielaw is when the First men name \"Torchelaw\" appears among those of the xushielaw Douglas lands seized in 1455 by the Crown, and it is known to have been the home of the Scotts for a century and a half after the death of Adam, the \" King of the Border.\" Mr Michael Anderson bought the place in 1688, and it is still held by his family. Though the Tower of Tushielaw appears so conspicuously in the records of blood and rapine, it is not without the sweeter interests of poetry and romance.

Tushielaw Tower, from its elevated situation, not only has an extensive view east and west of Ettrick Valley, but also looks across it up the Rankleburn Glen, at the opening to which is the modern mansion house of Cacrabank. The Scotts of Tushielaw are first mentioned in connection with Cacrabank when, in 1484, William Scott held the place free of rent in virtue of his office as Ranger of the Ward of Ettrick. Three miles up this lonely glen, among wild, bare masses of hill, near the road to Hawiek, is the deep ravine which, according to tradition, gave the ducal family of Buccleuch its title. Here, it is said, in this, \" the deepest, the steepest, and the greenest cleugh that is shone on by the sun,\" the traditional buck was slain ; and Kenneth III., who with his Court was hunting that day, gave the Galloway underkeeper who slew it the right to call himself \" John Scott in Buckscleugh.\" This, at least, is"], [68, "46 ETTRICK AND YARROW. the story told by Walter Scott of Satchells in 1688, but it is likelier that the name originated through the frequency with which the noble game resorted to its wild solitudes. Or, perhaps, the old spelling, Balcleugh, is the original form, and simply indicates that the cleuch was the site of a bal, or hamlet. Whatever be the fact, the poetic origin has held its ground to the present time, the Scotts adopted it as their family title, and the Galloway man has had many a successor equally bold and fearless. The \" bauld Buccleuch,\" who befriended Kinmont Willie, possessed a courage equally great, but of a finer order ; for when handed over to Elizabeth by King James, he is said to have responded to the angry Queen's question, \" How did you dare to do such a thing? \" \" Dare, madam; what would a man not dare to do ? \" An answer that won the respect of Elizabeth, and finds a parallel in the speech of another Borderer, referred to by Professor Veitch in his ' History and Poetry of the Scottish Border.' \"But what dae ye think o't ? \" he was asked, when prompted to do a daring deed. \" Think o't,\" said he, \" it's no the thinking that's onything ; it's the daeing o't and the deein' for't.\" Near the ravine are the two farm steadings of Easter and Wester Buccleuch, the former standing on the site of the old tower, of which there are now no signs. The noted church and burial ground of Buccleuch occu- pied a site some distance beyond the steading, where the Kirk Burn joins the Rankle Burn.

The Rankle Burn flows in a northward course for eight miles before mingling its waters with the Ettrick. A short distance above this junction is the farm of Annelshope, and beyond, on the right bank of the river, is the farm steading called Ettrickside, on the Thirlestane estate. At the annual fairs \u2014 in March for hiring servants, at the lamb fair in July, the September sale of draft ewes, and the little fair in November for the sale of fat sheep \u2014 the hamlet of Hopehouse, to the east of Ettrickside, was wont to present a busy appearance. A mile above this, on the right bank of the river, and two miles above Tushielaw, are the ancient tower and modern mansion - house of Thirlestane, the property of Lord Napier. From Hyndhope to this point, both road and river banks are fre quently lined with hawthorn, birch, and hazel copses ; but beyond, the valley is bare and treeless. The ivy-clad ruins of Thirlestane Tower, therefore, with clumps of pine on the neighbouring heights, and the manor surrounded by a fine plantation (containing some interesting specimens of old ash trees), and the broad, green haughland through which a small stream meanders to the Ettrick, present a pleasing picture in the landscape when contrasted with the wild, bare stretches of the upper valley.

According to common tra- dition, and to the testimony of Scott of Satchells, John Scott, who held the lands in tack from Melrose Abbey before 1536, was descended of Buccleuch, but the connection cannot be satis- factorily traced. T. Craig-Brown, after pointing out the defects of both Satchells' and Nisbet's \"tree,\" tracing the family through Scotts of How- pasley, suggests the following genealogy : \u2014 \" The very earliest mention of a Scott in connection with Thirlestane is the 30th November 1502, when at a Justiciary Court held in Selkirk, \" William Scott in Thirlestane came in the King's will for art and part of breaking the King's protection, upon Sir Patrick Creichtoun of Cranstoun Riddale, in occupying and labouring his set or assedation of Thirlestane without a lease from the said Patrick \u2014 Walter Scott of Buccleuch, surety to the King and party.\" Now, in a grant by Scott of Haining in 1476, William Scott, son of David of Buccleuch, appears as a witness. The question is, Was this William Scott, cadet of Buccleuch, the same with William Scott in Thirlestane, for whom young Walter of Buccleuch became surety ? It is not only possible, but it seems extremely prob- able. Further, there is good reason to believe that William, whoever he was, maintained his right to the lands which Crichton disputed. That he should be styled \"in\" rather than \"of\" Thirle stane is just what might be expected in a summons for illegal possession; and Crichton is never again heard of in connection with the place. But a Scott, D"], [72, "ETTRICK AND YARROW. 50 The Scott Napiers. the first well -authenticated ancestor of the Thirle stane family, is known to have possessed the lands in 1536, only thirty-four years after the dispute.

Sir William, his son, who in 1699 married the Mistress of Napier, adopted the sur name of Napier, and was the last to bear the name of Scott. The Napier family has a remarkable record both in arms and letters, and the Scott-Napier branch is not less distinguished. The present Lord Napier and Ettrick, seventh Baronet of Thirlestane, tenth possessor of the Scottish peerage of Napier, was born in 1819, and has had a distinguished career in the diplomatic service, having held several important appointments. From 1866 to 1872 he was Governor of Madras, and also for some time Acting Governor-General of India. His Lordship is LL.D. of Edinburgh and Glasgow. In 1872 he was created a peer of the United Kingdom, and paid a generous tribute to the vale of his race by then reviving the peerage of \"Ettrick,\" and becoming Baron Ettrick of Ettrick.

As the name Thirlestane indicates, at one time there was a mill in the vicinity of the tower, which is said to have stood on the site now occupied by the stables.

The date on which this mill was erected is unknown, but it must have been at a very early period, for the name was known in the thirteenth century. The mill lade can still be traced where it left the river. Professor Veitch says that the writer of the old song, \" Leader Haughs and Yarrow,\" one Nicol Burne, a wandering minstrel of the seventeenth century, found shelter in his old age with the Scotts of Thirlestane. He was among the last of the minstrels, and is by many considered to be the author of some of the surviving ballads of the Forest. The Professor says it is possible that Sir Walter Scott had him in mind when, in his introduction to the ' Lay of the Last Minstrel,' he speaks of the aged harper as \u2014 \"The last of all the bards was he Who sung of Border chivalry.\""], [74, "ETTRICK AND YARROW. 52 Games clench .

On the right bank of the river, facing Thirlestane, is the farm of Gamescleuch, the property of Lord Napier. Here also are the ruins of the ancient Tower of Gamescleuch, concerning the building of which James Hogg tells such a romantic and highly improbable tale in his poem called ' Thirlestane.' Hogg asserted that his tale was in the main correct ; but Mark Napier shows by documentary evidence that the story was purely the work of the Ettrick Shepherd's fertile imagination, not to speak of his economic truthfulness. Russell, in the ' Statistical Account,' says that in the genealogy of Scott in the possession of Lord Napier it is recorded \u2014 \"John Scott of Thirlestane married a daughter of Scott of Allanhaugh, by whom he had two sons \u2014 Robert, his heir, and Simon, called Longspear, who was tutor of Thirlestane, and built the tower of Games cleuch.\" In 1592 the place was held by Walter Scott of Tushielaw, his occupancy being confirmed by Act of Parliament, while in the early part of the seven teenth century it was again in the hands of the Thirlestane Scotts. Sir Walter Scott, in his note upon the ballad of ' The Dowie Dens,' says: \"The ballad refers to a duel fought at Deuchar-swyre, betwixt John Scott of Tushielaw and his brother in-law, Walter Scott, third son of Robert of Thirle stane, in which the latter was slain.\" T. Craig- Brown, in a parenthetical sentence in his note on Gamescleuch, suggests that the transfer of the tower may have been the cause of the deadly feud which ended in the famous duel.

Tima Water, rising on the heights between the parishes of Eskdalemuir and Ettrick, after a course of six miles, joins the river nearly opposite Ramsaycleuch. The road to the left passes over Eskdalemuir to Lockerbie and Langholm.

His schooling was prolonged for six months, during which time he learned to read a little and make letters half an inch long ! He perfected himself in this letter making by copying from print, scribbling on slaty rocks and odd pieces of paper, so that when he commenced to pen the marvellous whispers of the fairy queen, the task was so onerous that he took off his coat and vest and rolled up his shirt sleeves; but even then, at the end of six lines or so, his hand frequently took cramp ! As a man he was egotist, humorist, man of genius, and arrant simple ton each by turn ; and yet always loveable.

He was the second son of Robert Hogg, by Margaret Laidlaw, a distant relative of William Laidiaw, the author of ' Lucy's Flitting.' His father was originally a shepherd, but became farmer and stockdealer. When his son James was but six years of age the father became bankrupt, and had the mortification of seeing his goods \" rouped \" to pay the creditors. This bankruptcy, no doubt, had much to do with the imperfect schooling of James.

Here he read the ' History of Sir William Wallace ' for the first time, also Ram say's ' Gentle Shepherd,' and was fired with the ambition to become a poet. The next event of his life was when, at twenty years of age, he became At Black- shepherd to Mr Laidlaw at Blackhouse, in the Yarrow valley. Here he was treated more as a son than as a servant. All the books were at his disposal, and he benefitted greatly by the advice and society of William Laidlaw, the son of his master, who afterwards became the faithful amanuensis and lifelong friend of Sir Walter His Scott.

His ' Crook in the Lot,' written in a quaint and attractive style, was lighter reading.

Swan. Sir Walter Scott had always a fondness for this loch district : it was a favourite excursion with him to the end of his chequered life. In his introduction to the Second Canto of ' Marmion ' he has made the neighbourhood familiar to all English readers. The loch itself is the largest in the south of Scotland, and the natural terminus for the visitor to the Yar- row valley. In circumference it is seven and a-half miles, its length is three miles, and it is one mile broad from Cappercleuch to Bowerhope. It is joined at the south end by the Loch of the Lowes, a small lake one mile long and a quarter of a mile in breadth. There can be little doubt but that originally, as pointed out by Dr Russell, these lochs comprised but one sheet of water. \" It is evident they have originally formed one lake, whose margin extended a considerable way to the north-east. The difference"], [98, "76 ETTRICK AND YARROW. of level is only fifteen inches, and the narrow neck of land which now separates them has been raised by the opposite currents of the Corsecleuch and Oxcleuch burns.\" There has been much dispute over the etymology of the name now given to the smaller lake.

Risken hope. as Professor Veitch could show for his theory, if with less certainty, that the name was given because near the loch there was once a chapel, the lights of which continually kept burning before the altar cast their lowes over the lake ! The simplest explanation is, probably, that before the river course was so well defined there were many lakes in the Yarrow and Ettrick vales, but that St Mary's, then undivided, was known as the Loch of the Lochs, equivalent to Lacus de Lacubus of the medi\u00e6val records. ST MARY'S, TO THE WEST. Tibbie Shiel's should be made the starting point for a day's excursion into Moffatdale. The hills to the south-west of the isthmus that separates the Loch of the Lowes from St Mary's Loch, witnessed many a stirring escapade when the homeless and persecuted Covenanters fled before Claverhouse and his dragoons. Here the sons of the Covenant seem to have struggled, not only against the emissaries of the law, but also with palpable manifestations of the archfiend himself, as is recorded in the grim story of Dobb's Linn, a wild ravine near the head of Moffat water, where \u2014 \" Hab Dob and Davie Din Dang the deil ower Dobson's Linn \" At Riskenhope, to the south of the loch, James Renwick, the last of the Scots Worthies to suffer martyrdom in Scotland; preached one of his last sermons near the head of Riskenhope Burn.

At the head of the loch, to the west, stands the farmstead of Chapelhope, so called from an ancient chapel that once stood here, probably \" Rodono Chapel,\" the ruined mounds of which can still be traced. In front of the house is the Court Knowe, an artificial mound where the Bailies of Rodono dispensed justice on behalf of the Abbot of Melrose. Craig-Brown says: \u2014 \"Farther up, on the west side of the road above the bridge, is the Standard Knowe, a relic, probably, of the rural court held here by Queen Mary and Darnley just after the murder of Rizzio. Not far from the Standard Knowe is a circular space about a hundred feet in diameter, enclosed by earthen mounds, and having in its centre the mouldering lines of the chapel (33 feet long by 18 broad), lying due east and west. Other mounds in the neighbourhood, nearer the river, bear witness to the existence at one time of a considerable village. For two centuries or more Chapelhope has been tenanted by a family bearing the honoured Forest name of Laidlaw.\" These Laidlaws were the maternal ancestors of James Hogg, and having been most zealous in sheltering the persecuted Covenant ers they had many tales to tell of their sufferings and hairbreadth escapes, from the recital of which the Ettrick Shepherd gathered material for his 'Brownie of Bodsbeck.'

She then barred the door, and taking from the rafters an axe used for chopping wood, said, \" Did onybody see you come in ? \" \" No,\" faltered the unwelcome visitor. \" Then,\" said Jenny, with an uncanny emphasis, \" Naebody '11 see ye gang oot.\" The discomfited tramp seeing the douce, honest woman transformed into such a virago, pled for his life. Any one who knows the loneliness of the situation will appreciate the pluck shown by Jenny of Birkhill. The country beyond Birkhill is mountainous and wild, but you are within easy walking distance of the Grey Mare's Tail, the highest waterfall in Scotland; also of the dark tarn, Loch Skene. In his notes to ' Marmion,' Scott says : \u2014 Loch Skene is a mountain lake, of considerable size, at the head of Moffat Water. The character of the scenery is uncommonly savage ; and the earn, or Scottish eagle, has, for many ages, built its nest yearly upon an islet in the lake. Loch Skene discharges itself into a brook, which, after a short and precipitate course, falls from a cataract of immense height and gloomy grandeur, called, from its appearance, the \" Grey Mare's Tail.\" \"Deep down, and far within, Toils with the rocks the roaring linn ; Then, issuing forth one foamy wave, And wheeling round the Giant's Grave, White as the snowy charger's tail, Drives down the pass of Moffatdale.\" \" ' The Giant's Grave ' is a sort of trench, which bears that name, a little way from the foot of the"], [102, "ETTRICK AND YARROW 80 cataract.

Indeed, unless we had prudently left our gallant steeds at a farm-house below, and borrowed hill-ponies for the occasion, the result might have been worse than laughable. As it was, we rose like the spirits of the bogs, covered cap-a-pie with slime, to free themselves from which, our wily ponies took to rolling about on the heather, and we had nothing for it but following their example. At length, as we approached the gloomy loch, a huge eagle heaved himself from the margin and rose right over us, screaming his scorn of the intruders ; and altogether it would be impossible to picture any- thing more desolately savage than the scene which opened, as if raised by enchantment on purpose to gratify the poet's eye.

The second day of June the King passed out of Edinburgh to the hunting, with many of the nobles and gentlemen of Scot land with him, to the number of twelve thousand Meggat Foot and St Mary's Loch. men ; and then passed to Meggitland, and hounded and hawked all the county and bounds ; that is to say, Crammat, Pappertlaw, St Mary's - laws, Carlavrick, Chapel, Ewindoores, and Longhope.

He found clan feuds rife, the raids of numerous freebooters the order of the day, and he determined to vindicate the law, and bring the chief of these marauders to justice. Here, on the wooded rising ground, north-east of this bridge, stood Henderland Tower, the stronghold of one Cockburne, a notorious freebooter, whose family had been in possession of the place since 1383, when the lands were gifted by Robert III. James had either directed his ex pedition to this district, or the opportunity was too favourable to lose, for report has it that he swooped down upon the famous reiver quite unexpectedly, and hanged him and his followers over their own gateway. At one time a chapel stood near the tower, and in the burial place attached, a large stone may still be seen, broken in three parts, with a cross, sword, and shield carved upon it, also the brief inscription : \" Here lyis Perys of Cockburne and his wife Marjory.\" Tradition asserts that this is the last resting place of the bold freebooter and his wife. But in this instance, at least, tradition has not verified its claims by subsequent research ; for the lawless Borderer, to whom James gave such short shrift, was not called Pierce, but William Cockburne. Even the summary execution must pass through the alembic of criticism, for it is almost beyond question that the freebooter seized by James V. was, along with others taken in the same expedition \u2014 notoriously Adam Scott of Tushie law \u2014 tried and executed in Edinburgh.

One of the oldest extant references is when, by an order of Edward I., in 1292, Master Edmund de Letham was presented to the church. It has successively been in the hands of Roman Catholics, Episcopalians, and Presbyterians ; while in its memory-haunted kirk yard, knight, monk, peasant, Border thief, and peaceful baron lie side by side with the romantic and unfortunate lovers of the Douglas tragedy. Tradition, poetry, and authentic history have con spired to make this lonely Kirk of the Forest one of the best known in the annals of Scotland. Sir Walter Scott, in his notes to ' Marmion,' says \u2014 \" The chapel of St Mary's of the Lowes was situ ated on the eastern side of the lake to which it gives name. It was injured by the clan of Scott in a feud with the Cranstouns, but continued to be a place of worship during the seventeenth cen tury.

The deputy opened the conversation by saying : \" What a glorious country this is ! \" \" Yes,\" said the shep herd, \"it's a very good country.\" \"And such majestic rivers ! \" \" Yes,\" was the laconic reply. \" And such grand forests ! \" \" Yes,\" again replied the home-sick Caledonian, \"but there are nae linties in the woods, and nae braes like Yarrow.\" It is not sufficient to say that all the talk of pastoral melancholy and of pensive sweetness is the result of poetic expectancy begot of local tradition. Men of undoubted veracity and of acknowledged competency have recorded what they really felt when using these terms. When Robert Cham bers says \" there is something highly peculiar in Yarrow,\" his statement is corroborated by such authorities as William Wordsworth and Christopher North. There can be no doubt that the long, un broken, undulating line of green, set off by a blue sky, and dark moving shadow on hill and stream, does produce a peculiar feeling, which is akin to a throb, not of pain, nor exactly of pleasure, unless it be \"the pleasure of a hushed enjoyment.\" But it was a different kind of scenery that gave birth to the sweet and mysterious sadness of Yarrow's ballads. Then the valley was thickly wooded, and the hills, swathed in garments of skaum, sent their rills, undrained, dull and gruesome, to the river; while the rays of the sun glimmered through the tree-tops, and shimmered through the mists that rose from the marshes formed by the out -flow of the stream.

The soldier, returned from home or foreign battles, daily at his lonely occupation in the fields or on the hills, had his brooding reminis cences broken in upon by the startled intrusion of hart, fox, and wild boar, or by urgent summons to acts of revenge \u2014 daring and dangerous as that recorded in ' Jamie Telfer ' \u2014 while nightly he told his thrilling tales of fallen comrades and doughty deeds to the desolate mother or forlorn maid. Such circumstances supply the raw material for the richest minstrelsy ; but to few valleys was fate so kindly as to Yarrow, for she gave it a minstrel historian, who struck the key-note to all succeeding \" makers.\" A great nature was this singer, with a tragic vein that lent itself to the characteristics of the vale when the \" houms \" were more \"dowie\" than now, and when social conditions made the tenor of life more uncertain, and gave it a deeper colour than that common to the present age. To day we have, perhaps, the survival of those songs which were nearest in spirit to the master's art ; surviving for that reason, and some, may be, not without traces of the master's hand. The mirror reflects the scene and the actor, and it takes both to reveal the secret of Yarrow's charm. To-day, though perhaps in a lesser degree, we have still the charm of nature, which, linked to human nature's passionate appeal in romantic memories of warrior's strife and maiden's constancy, make the glamour and fascination of this valley irresist ible.

And during the time of James VI., the same precious metal is said to have been found at Kershope, where also, says Dr Cranstoun, about 1749, \"there is a little strand which, after a spate of rain, frequently casteth out many pieces of lead.\" On the Glen gaber Burn also, there are traces that the stream has been diverted from its course, that the sand might be washed, in the search for gold. But the chief yield of Yarrow's quarries is, and will be, blue grey whinstone, for the silurian groundwork of the parish offers little prospect of mineral wealth.

These forest courts were at length superseded by regular sittings of the Sheriff. In the year that Cromwell was appointed Protector, 1653, a bridge was built over the Yarrow; and Craig- Brown takes this as an evidence that after centuries of war and rapine the people were beginning to settle down to the enjoyment of assured peace. The most interesting historical event connected with the vale is the battle of Philiphaugh, fought at its eastern extremity in the year 1645. For the rest, the history of Yarrow is that of \" St Mary's Church of the Forest.\" To-day, the post-gig, the baker's van, and the morning newspaper have de stroyed even the pastoral melancholy of Yarrow, while the tourist and summer tripper have effectu ally scared the fairies and brownies from its dowie houms. All that is wanting now to break the charm of its sacred memories, and make it common as other valleys once renowned in story, is the in trusion of the iron horse ; and even that, it is believed, may not be long delayed. Opposite Cappercleuch, on the east side of the lake, is the picturesquely situated farm steading of Bowerhope. In the middle of the 15th century it was a six pound forest stede in the Ward of Ettrick, and in 1654 Queen Mary granted it to the family of Cessford Kers, \"for the yearly payment of Jno, and providing for the erection of sufficient mansions of stone and lime, &c.\" The mansions erected on Bowerhope, whether by Kers or others, could not have been very spacious ; for Dr Russell says the roof was so low that when his father con ducted the usual exhortations there he had to stand"], [119, "DOWN YARROW TO THE DOWIE DENS. 97 Story of the tenant Kirkstead Dryhope with his head between two rafters ; a most uncom fortable position, especially when the place was packed with people and filled with smoke. And yet there is a story told, with many variations, of Sandy Cunningham, a tenant of Bowerhope, who, returning from the Church of Ettrick, where the minister had delivered an impressive sermon on the joys of the other world, remarked, as he looked down on his own Forest steading : \" Ay, ay, New Jerusalem here or New Jerusalem there, gi'e me Boorhope ! \" then, with a proper Scotch reserva tion, he added, \"at a raisonable rent.\" Directly to the east of the old kirkyard is Kirkstead farm, once, as the name indicates, the glebe lands of St Mary's Church. As early as the last quarter of the 1 6th century it was in the hands of the Buc cleuch family; in 1643 it belonged to the Earl of Traquair, and in 1750 the Duke of Buccleuch bought the place of this family. In the year 1640, when the Yarrow Church was removed further down the valley, no arrangements were made con cerning the glebe land, so that afterwards the right of the minister to the annual rent of pasturage was disputed. After much disputation between the Duke's agents and the Presbytery, the matter was made the subject of expensive litigation, which re sulted in the Yarrow minister abandoning all claim to Kirkstead for an annual payment of -\u00a3\"70 sterling. Passing down the valley, on the left, and easily seen from the road, is the old Tower of Dryhope. \"Then gaze on Dryhope's ruined Tower, And think on Yarrow's faded Flower.\" Scott says : \" Near the lower extremity of the lake G"], [120, "98 ETTRICK AND YARROW are the ruins of Dryhope Tower, the birthplace of \u2022The Mary Scott, daughter of Philip Scott of Dryhope, Flower of famous by the traditional name of the ' Flower Yarrow.

She was married to Walter Scott of Mamagc Harden, no less renowned for his depredations than Harden t{ his bride for her beauty*\" The author of 'Waver- Mary ley ' traced his descent through these two, and with a characteristic Scotch pride proclaimed the fact in his ' Autobiography.' Regarding this marriage, Mr Craig-Brown refutes the prevalent belief that, while Scott of Dryhope bound himself to find his future son-in-law in man's meat and horse's meat at his own house for a year and a day, five barons en gaged to see that Harden, at the expiry of that time, did not seek to remain by force ; and, also, the further fiction that Harden bound himself to give his father-in-law the fruits of his first Michael mas raid ! Mr Craig-Brown also corrects the common mistake, perpetuated by Mr Robert Cham bers, that the Flower of Yarrow was the ancestress of Miss Elliot of Minto, who wrote the imperish able song, \"The Flowers ofthe Forest.\" \"Mary's daughter, Margret, married Elliot of Stobs, not of The Old Minto.\" The massive, square ruins of the tower, with walls three and a half to four feet thick, are well preserved, and stand on a slight eminence be tween two burns. Mr Craig-Brown says : \" On the north and south sides it measures 33 feet, by 22 feet on the east and west. Including dungeon and roof there are four storeys, and the probable height, from ground to gable peak, would be about 40 feet.

In 1596, Salkeld, deputy of Lord Scroope, the English Warden, in violation of safe conduct pledges, had seized William Armstrong of Kinnin month, and incarcerated him in Carlisle Tower. Buccleuch, finding remonstrance of no avail, de termined to surprise the castle, and rescue his countryman ; and so, with a party of two hundred horse, he set out from Morton Tower, on a tem pestuous night, to put his bold plan into execution. In strong and realistic verse the writer pictures Salkeld meeting with successive parties of the dis guised Borderers. In dramatic fashion, and with tragic result, he thus accosts the band led by Dick of Dryhope \u2014 ' ' Where be ye gaun, ye broken men ? ' Quo' fause Sakelde ; ' Come tell to me !

Dr Russell records the fact that in 1784 the shep herds were thrown into a great state of consternation by witnessing here a marvellous \"wonder in the heavens.\" The wonder turned out to be Lunardi's balloon, and the aeronaut, mistaking St Mary's for an arm of the sea, attempted unsuccessfully to land at Dryhope. In the attempt he lost an anchor and a flag. The anchor came into the possession of the farmer, Mr Ballantyne, and the flag was cut up into four silk handkerchiefs ; rather an unusual deposit to be made by a heavenly body ! The Douglas Burn, rising in the Dun Rig (2500), the highest point in Selkirkshire, runs a mile or more below Dryhope, near the Craig-of-Douglas, through a small bridge on the highway, to the Yarrow. Three miles up this gloomy glen, on the Blackhouse heights (2214) are the ruins of Black house Tower, a baronial residence of the Lords of Douglas, and, according to tradition, the scene of the powerful old ballad, the ' Douglas Tragedy.' If tradition speaks the truth, this will be one of the oldest extant peels in the Border country, but Craig- Brown's words are worth quoting on this point : \"The little peel is neither large nor strong com pared with others in its neighbourhood *, and we feel disposed to identify the tragedy rather with the tower of Douglas Craig, destroyed by King James in 1450. In fact, the Douglas family never after that date had anything to do with Ettrick Forest ; and it is certain Blackhouse Tower cannot pretend to such antiquity. It probably does not go further back than the acquisition of the lands by the Traquair family in the end of the 16th century.\""], [123, "DOWN YARROW TO THE DOWIE DENS. 101 The Douglas possession Scene of the ballad. The account which makes the Black Douglasses possessors of a strong tower up this glen so far back as the reign of Malcolm Canmore is not sup ported by documentary evidence. It is certain, however, that the Good Lord James had the lands of Ettrick Forest conferred on him by royal grant about 1322. For this stronghold, among these stern and savage heights, Sir James had great affection, and it is probable the conspicuous skill he displayed in fishing and deer hunting during the highland wanderings of Bruce and his followers, was gained on the streams and hills of this forest of Ettrick. As noted above, King James II. took and destroyed Crag Douglass in 1450, but the Douglas family continued Lords of Ettrick till their forfeiture of the lands a few years later, in 1455. On the heights beyond Blackhouse Tower are the standing stones said to mark the scene of the fatal combat described in the ballad of the ' Douglas Tragedy.' Concerning these stones, Professor Veitch says, they \"are obviously greatly older than any reason able date which can be assigned to the story of the ballad, and instead of there being only seven, as is commonly alleged, there are eleven in all now visible. Three of these are still standing, and eight are lying flat on the ground. In form they present the appearance of a semicircle, the section forming the base lying to the north, or up the hill. The structure obviously belongs to the general class of stone circles common on the lowland hills, which may have been places of judicature, or worship, or burial, or all three.\" Tradition does not so much say that these stones were erected to mark, as that they do indicate, the site of the incident recorded"], [124, "102 ETTRICK AND YARROW. A rgument ofthe ballad. James Hogg shepherd at Black house in the ballad ; therefore, as Professor Veitch remarks, there is no reason why these stones should not have been the scene of an historical event such as that described in the tragedy. The ballad story runs thus \u2014 Lady Margaret, probably a Douglas, flees from Blackhouse Tower with Lord William, her lover. They take the now disused, though still traceable medi\u00e6val riding road from Yarrow to Tweed. The mother of Lady Margaret soon discovers the flight, and incites her husband and seven sons to follow and overtake them. They overtake the lovers not far from the tower, when Lord William slays the seven brothers and wounds the father. The lady pleads for her father's life, and leaving him wounded on the hill side they continue their flight. But Lord William has himself received a mortal wound in the unequal combat, for his life's blood dyes the burn at which they stop to drink. With much difficulty they arrive at the home of the bold knight, but, \u2014 Lord William was dead lang ere midnight, Lady Marg'ret lang ere day. Lord William was buried in St Marie's Kirk, Lady Marg'ret in Marie's quire; Out o' the lady's grave grew a bonnie red rose. And out o' the knight's a brier.\" The incidents are strongly delineated, and the spirit of the whole is characteristic of the best Yarrow poems. But it does not need the location of any ballad to make Blackhouse Glen a place of interest, for up here, on the Hawkshaw Rig, James Hogg, with his faithful Hector, herded sheep, and \u2014 \"Found in youth a harp among the hills Dropt by the Elfin people."], [125, "DOWN YARROW TO THE DOWIE DENS. 103 And the Queen of the Fairies, rising silently Through the pure mist, stood at the Shepherd's feet, And half forgot her own green Paradise, Far in the bosom of the hill\u2014 so wild, So sweet, so sad, flowed forth that Shepherd's lay.\" Here too he found his first great ambition, when, Hisfirst in 1796, the half-witted Jock Scott recited to him j^JJ** the bewitching episodes of ' Tam o' Shanter,' assert ing that the poem was the work of an Ayrshire ploughman, Robert Burns, of whom Hogg had never heard before. He had the verses recited till he could repeat them himself, and then his determina tion was baptised with joyful and ambitious tears. Here was a fitting outlet for the legendary lore learned at his mother's knee : \" he could tell more stories and sing more songs than ever ploughman in the world;\" and thus self-elected successor, Hogg, to the end of his eventful life, followed, though afar off, in the footsteps of the immortal ploughman poet. Here also, in 1780, at the farm of Blackhouse, William Laidlaw was born, the amanuensis and Birthplace lifelong friend of Walter Scott, and the author of fj^w\" ' Lucy's Flittin',' a Border lyric second only in merit to the ' Flowers of the Forest.' It is further' worth remembering that up the Douglas Glen, Sir Walter Scott, together with his friend Leyden \u2014 in search Scott's first of ballads for the ' Minstrelsy,' and, as Shortreed said, thus \" makin' himsell a' the time \" \u2014 met Loch.

The site of the Ettrick Shepherd's cottage can be seen from the Yarrow Road ; it is not far from the path leading by Altrive Lake to Tushielaw. Altrive Moss was given to the Shepherd by the Duke of Buccleuch. The poet had dedicated his ' Queen's Wake ' to the Duchess of Buccleuch, and during her life she took frequent opportunities of showing her interest in him ; and, when on her death bed, she requested her husband to \" remember her poor poet.\" Altrive, last resid ence of James Hogg. That remembrance took this practical form \u2014 Hogg being offered the farm at a nominal rent, which practically meant rent free ; and he came to it in 1817.

All the time of his residence at Altrive, Hogg was a mystery to the douce husbandmen of the valley. How a man so highly respected, one who was an authority on sheep farming, and an author to boot, could not, with a free farm, keep out of difficulties seemed to them incomprehensible. His friend, Sir Walter Scott, makes the reason clear enough. \" After various shiftings, he at last obtained, from the Duke of Buccleuch's kindness, the gratuitous life rent of a small farm in the vale of Yarrow, and had he contented himself with the careful management of its fields, the rest of his days might have been easy.

They walked down the road past Mount Benger, Sir Walter leaning heavily on Hogg's arm, and walking very feebly.

The pastoral farm of Mount Benger lies to the north, a short distance below the inn, and is inter esting chiefly because farmed for some time by James Hogg. Hogg's great ambition, according to his biographer, was to become a stock farmer, and thus a person of importance, looked up to, as he from a boy had been accustomed to respect his employers. The expectation of a fair dowry at his marriage en abled him to take a lease of this farm, and seemed to open up a way for the gratification of his desires. But misfortune was always dogging the Shepherd's footsteps. His wife's father became bankrupt, and so the farm could not be stocked ; and the history of Altrive explains how his other interests were mismanaged. Sir Walter Scott tried to better his position by securing a prominent place for his un fortunate friend at the coronation of George IV., hoping that a poem on the subject by the Ettrick Shepherd might secure him a pension, or some other consideration likely to ease him of his troubles for a while. Scott even got him an invitation from Lord Sidmouth to meet the Duke of York and some other wellwishers at Richmond Park. Hogg's reply to this invitation of his friend was characteristic : he begged to decline, because the 18th of July was St Boswells Fair, and his absence from that would be considered by his new compeers as highly im prudent and discreditable !

It is worth mentioning that William Wordsworth, who has done so much for the popularity of the vale, got his first view of the Yarrow when stand ing near the old farm-house of Mount Benger, which stood behind the present steading, in a field to the north-east, known as Benger Knowes.

A comparison of the early spellings will convince the reader that Mont Berger, signifying \" shepherd hill,\" was the original name \u2014 an etymol ogy that would have doubtless delighted a shepherd who in modern times shed some lustre on the place.\" Hogg's poetical references to the place are few, and not noteworthy.

As far back as 1792 it is mentioned that a portion of land between Catslack Burn and Whitehope was parcelled out into lots, or feus ; hence the name applied to this hamlet. The modern names of these few cottages tell of quite a different state of society and surround ings, from those in which the wild cat lent its name to the land. In the ecclesiastical turmoil of '43 the \"moderate\" and \"non-intrusion\" controversies penetrated, and disturbed the calm even of the Yarrow valley, and a goodly number, for conscience sake, were forced to become \"seceders.\" Two Fi\u00ab years after, the Free Church, which stands on the Yarrow tight of the route, was erected.

It was the residence of Elizabeth Ker of Cessford, Dowager Lady of Buc cleuch, who had survived her husband no less than forty-four years. In pursuance of their inveterate blood feud with Buccleuch, certain of the Kers, leaguing themselves with the English to harass the Scotts, attacked Catslack and burned it. The old Dowager, whose cries for rescue were unheeded even by the Kers, her kinsmen, perished in the flames.\" The feuar, finding that the ruins of this old tower interfered with the cultivation of his field, and that the stones were useful for caulding the river, re moved them about the middle of this century, so that now no trace is left of what was at one time a Forest stronghold of the Scotts. Should the journey be made down Yarrow in early summer, the road, for a considerable distance below the School-house, will be found lined with thick masses of yellow whin ; and opposite these, on the south bank of the river, stands the farm of Lad hope. Craig-Brown says that in the Exchequer Rolls, 1455-68, Ladhope is mentioned as a forest stead paying \u00a36 yearly, and one bow cow, to the King. Also, that in 1507 grant was made \"to Walter Scott of Howpaslot and his heirs of the lands of Lawdhope, with power to build a fortalice, and furnish it with such defences and munition as are necessary to guard against invasion of thieves and malefactors.\" Again it is recorded that on the"], [134, "ETTRICK AND YARROW. 112 Etymology Annan Street, scene of the Dowie Dens Scene ofthe xombat. 7th February 1543-4, by command of the English General Wharton, the Armstrongs burnt the \"toune of Laduppe,\" belonging to the Lord of Howpasley. While,, on the 17th July, 1544, Lord Wharton re ports that the Armstrongs repeated their depreda tions. In 1621, Walter, Earl of Buccleuch, received from James VI. a charter of certain lands, including Ladhope, since which time the place has been held by that family. As the name indicates, its origin is to be found in a mill lade, lad being the Anglo- Saxon for an artificial mill stream. At this point in our progress down the valley, we come to a tract of land, on the farm of WThite hope, known as Annan Street, one of the most sacred spots in Yarrow ; for here, report will have it, the combat of the 'Dowie Dens' was fought. The scene must be very disappointing to any one who has surrounded the dowie holmes of Yarrow with a glamour of mystery and romance. There is nothing to see save a bare enclosed field, with two large unhewn standing stones about a hundred yards apart, and, below, the river running gently and clearly, or tumbling drumly and grey, on its way to join Ettrick below Bowhill. The minister of Yarrow in 1833 prepared a statis tical account of his parish, in which he says of this place \u2014 \" There is a piece of ground lying to the west of Yarrow Kirk which appears to have been the scene of slaughter and sepulture. From time immemorial it was a bare, waste moor, till twenty five years ago, when formed into a number of culti vated enclosures. On more than twenty different spots were large cairns, in many of which fine yellow dust, and in one an old spear was found."], [135, "DOWN YARROW TO THE DOWIE DENS. 113 The standing stones. The inscribed stone. Two unhewn, massive stones still stand about one hundred yards distant from each other, and which, doubtless, are the monuments of the dead. The real tradition simply bears \u2014 that here a deadly feud was settled by dint of arms ; the upright stones mark the place where the lords or leaders fell ; and the bodies of the followers were thrown into a marshy pool called the Dead Lake, in the adjoining haugh. It is probable that this is the locality of ' The Dowie Dens of Yarrow.' \" Sir Walter Scott had less hesitation than the pastor of Yarrow in changing this probability into a certain tradition. He changed the name of the site into Annan's Treat to fit a theory that the \"stubborn knight\" was called Annan, and then he boldly affirmed of the two standing stones that \" the least child that can herd a cow will tell the passenger that there lie ' the two lords who were slain in single combat.'\" The stone furthest up the valley is the inscribed stone, concerning the correct reading of which there has been such diversity of opinion. Dr Russell, in his ' Reminiscences of Yarrow,' says of this stone, that at the beginning of this century \" when the cultivation of the moor began, the plough struck upon a large flat stone of unhewn greywacke, bearing a Latin inscription. Bones and ashes lay beneath it, and on every side the surface presented verdant patches of grass. It was examined by Sir Walter Scott, Dr John Leyden, Mungo Park, and others of antiquarian lore. From the rudeness and indistinctness of the carving upon the hard rock, only the following characters can be deciphered : \u2014 \"Hic memoriae et hic jacent in tumulo duo filii liberali.\" Antiquarians have most successfully H"], [136, "ETTRICK AND YARROW 114 Inscription Warrior's Rest.

One of the latest readings is given by Craig-Brown : Hic memori\u00e6 Ceti \u2014 Loi Nenniq Fii Princi P et I Nudi Dumnogeni \u2014 Hic jacent In Tumulo Duo Filii Liberalis. Here is the monument of Cetilous and Nennus, sons of Nudd Dumnonian prince and \" Emperor.\" Here lie buried the two sons of Liberalis. The second stone is further over in the glebe land of the Kirk ; and at the shepherd's house, known as -the Warrior's Rest, on the left, a little further down the valley, is a third stone also said to mark the spot of ancient sepulture. One thing is almost certain in connection with this district, that between Catcraig and Catslack an ancient battle, or battles, have been fought. Here numerous stone cists containing human remains have been found, and cart loads of bones are said to have been unearthed to the west of the church and put upon the glebe lands. And it is not improbable that when the water from the hills and the overflow of the river formed a marshy pool on the adjoining haugh, overshadowed by alder and willow trees, this rising ground, the scene of ancient sepulture, was frequently used as a rendezvous for settling personal feuds. Thus, from the character of the scenes enacted there, and from the nature of the surroundings, when the neighbouring heights were thickly wooded, and the course of the river not so well defined, the \" dowie holmes,\" no doubt a"], [137, "DOWN YARROW TO THE DOWIE DENS 115 Theme of the ballad.

Of the ballad, Sir Walter Scott in his ' Minstrelsy' says \u2014 \" Tradition affirms that the hero of the song (be he who he may) was murdered by the brother, either of his wife or betrothed bride. The alleged cause of malice was the lady's father having pro posed to endow her with half of his property, upon her marriage with a warrior of such renown.\" For a time Scott thought the hero of the song was John Scott, sixth son of the Laird of Harden, murdered in Ettrick Forest by his kinsmen the Scotts of Gilmanscleuch. Afterwards, he was inclined to think that the reference was to a duel fought at Deuchar Swire, in which Walter Scott, third son of Robert of Thirlestane, was slain by John Scott of Tushielaw. But the circumstances mentioned in the ballad make it improbable that this is the duel referred to, for in that fray the wife was not a sister of the slayer, and there was no stabbing from behind, or unequal conflict with \"nine armed men.\" In a note under Gamescleuch, Craig - Brown gives a probable reason for this duel at Deuchar Swire between Walter Scott of Thirlestane and John Scott of Tushielaw. In the Presbytery records of Selkirk, under the date 1616, Walter Scott of Tushielaw is mentioned as having made \" an informal and inordinate mar riage with Grizell Scott of Thirlstane, without con sent of her father.\" Shortly afterwards Simon Scott of Bonytoun, an adherent of Thirlstane, along with three other Scotts, are summoned \" to compear in Melrose to hear themselves excommunicate for the horrible slaughter of Walter Scott.\" Not a few"], [138, "116 ETTRICK AND YARROW. have taken this elopement and consequent murder to be the subject of the 'Dowie Dens of Yarrow,' but it is safe to say that no historical combat con nected with the valley can, with any certainty, be referred to as the theme of the ballad, just as we can without hesitation assert that the standing stones, to the west of Yarrow Kirk, commemorate an event which took place hundreds of years before any of those given as the probable motif of the famous poem. In the old days of sturt and strife, when strength of arm was a charter of right, Yar row's celebrated minstrel would have no lack of subjects sad as the ' Dowie Dens,' and pitiful as ' Willie's Drowned in Yarrow,' to inspire his pen. But the historical discrepancies do not in the least affect the value of the poet's work ; it has given the keynote to which all the Yarrow songs are sung, and quickened the genius of many a famous poet \u2014 noticeably in its pathetic and tragic sequel by William Hamilton of Bangour \u2014 for, as Professor Veitch has said, \" for brevity, directness, and graphic turn of narrative, vivid picturing, and the image of passionate devotion to the dead, there are few ballads in any language that match its strains.\""], [139, "Yarrow Kirk.

In the back wall of the church there is a mural tablet to the memory of John Ruther ford, formerly schoolmaster of Selkirk, and ordained to this charge, September 30th 1691, being the first incumbent of Yarrow after the Revolution. Mr Rutherford was the maternal great grandfather of Sir Walter Scott ; from this line of descent the poet is said to have got his literary genius, and recog nised it by occasionally visiting what he termed \" the shrine of his ancestors.\" The church underwent extensive repairs in 1826, also in 1876 numerous alterations were made; but the elementary nature of the finishings in the original church, and the simple customs of the time are well described by Dr Russell in the ' Rem iniscences of Yarrow.' The windows were small, and the light insufficient; there was no ceiling; and, on great days, the exposed rafters afforded seats for the adventurous youth, who perched on them like hens on their baulks. The seats had no doors or separation between the pews, and had only a plank to serve as a foot board. The shep herds were regularly accompanied to church by their dogs, and these not infrequently showed fight, and rushing below the pews among the feet of the worshippers, raised such a dust and din that the prayer or sermon became inaudible; this, with an occasional solo from a musical cur during the psalmody, must have tried the gravity and the patience of not a few.

It is beyond doubt that the most popular of these ministers were the saintly Dr Robert Russell and his genial and gifted son, James. These two ministered in Yarrow for almost a century, and have made the name of Russell a household word in the valley. Robert Russell, as we have already seen, was translated from the parish of Ettrick in 1791, and was inducted in Yarrow on September ist of that same year. In 1805 he was appointed by Francis, Lord Napier, Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly, as his chaplain, a position which he retained for thirty seven years without being once absent from his duties. On the 3rd April 181 1, he received from the University of Edinburgh the degree of Doctor of Divinity.

James Russell, son of the former, was born in the Yarrow Manse, December ist 1809. He was the second of three children, the issue of the marriage in 1803 of Robert Russell and Agnes Turnbull. On the completion of his studies in June 1831, he was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Selkirk, and for several years ministered in what is now the parish of Kirkhope, till in July, 1841, he was appointed assistant and successor to his father in Yarrow.

The bridge spanning Yarrow opposite the manse joins the road leading by the west slope of Witchie Knowe (121 3) into Ettrick vale, near Kirkhope, a distance of three and a quarter miles. Half a mile or more from the bridge, along this Kirkhope road, to the east, is the steading of Wester Kershope, while north of this again, and nearer the river, is Easter Kershope, both belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch, and let along with Ladhope. According to some, the name had its origin with a family of English Kers who settled in this forest hope, some time perhaps in the thirteenth century. Professor Veitch, however, derives it from Caer, a fort. T.

Deuchar Chapel, already alluded to, stood hard by, and the few cottages to the west of this valley are the only representatives of a considerable hamlet that flourished near, up till a comparatively recent period. Deuchar Swire is a path leading from this point over the hills by way of Traquair into the valley of Tweed. On this swire Walter Scott of Thirlestane was slain in a duel with John Scott of Tushielaw in 1609, an incident, according to many, which forms the ground work of the ' Dowie Dens.' The common derivation of Deuchar is Du Chotre, the small valley ; but Craig-Brown, in his ' Chronicles of the Poorest,' gives a most romantic guess. He says : \u2014 \" As in etymology everything is possible, it may be permitted to mention that there is a Duquher seven miles south of Dumfries, which has a very remarkable origin. It is traceable through Douzquev to Douce C\u0153nr, hence its vernacular name of Sweet-heart Abbey. Enshrined in it was the embalmed heart of its foundress's husband.

The Homes also were proprietors of this farm, for in 1600, John, brother to Alexander Home of Manderston, disponed the lands by charter to James Pringle of Buckholm. James and John Pringle of Buckholm sold Tynneis to the Earl of Buc cleuch in 1619 for 20,000 merks, and it is still part of the ducal estate. Concerning the peculiar name Mr Brown points out that, \" on the right bank of Liddell water, about six miles above where it falls into the Esk, there is both a Tinnis Hill and a Tinnis Burn, a remarkable fact being that, as in Selkirkshire, this Tinnis is confronted across the river by a Kershope and Kershope Burn. Another instance is Tinnis Castle in Peeblesshire, said to be a corruption of Thane's Castle, but on what ground is not stated.\" In the fifth stanza of the ' Dowie Dens ' mention is made of the \" Tennies bank,\" but it throws no light on the locality of the ballad, as, going west, the duellist would pass Tinnis on his way either to Deuchar Swire, or to the site beyond the kirk. The farm of Fastheugh lies at the northern base of Fastheugh Hill (1645), and near the river. For long in the hands of the Murrays, it now belongs to the Duke of Buccleuch.

The land runs to about 3000 acres, and is for the most part pastoral. The valley at this point narrows considerably, and we come upon a succession of scenes no less interesting for their intrinsic beauty than for their historical importance in the annals of the Forest. The first is Hangingshaw, which from the time The Haug of the famous \" outlaw \" was the chief seat of the ln8shaw ancient Murray family.

John Murray of Falahill in 1462 was herdkeeper to Mary, the Queen of James II. Later he became custos of the royal hunting seat of Newark Castle and overseer of the Forest. The outlaw of the ballad was probably John, grandson of Murray of Falahill, a man of reputed great height, strength, and boldness. At the Castle of Hangingshaw he kept a retinue worthy of a king, and, if the ballad gives even the spirit of the event, was able to treat with James IV. practically on his own terms. The Murrays at this time were invested with the Sheriffdom of Ettrick Forest, and the family held the office till its abolition in the reign of George II.

No trace of the tower now remains ; but the situation, when the surrounding hills were covered with the growth of a Scotch forest, was eminently fitted for the stronghold of an outlawed baron. The Outlaw Murray did not long exercise his legal authority, for tradition has it that shortly after the events narrated in the song, he was shot by an arrow from the bow of Scott of Haining, while another report says he was slain by Buc cleuch himself, the head of the Clan Scott. Dr Russell, in his ' Reminiscences,' says : \" Hang ingshaw Castle had a commanding position half way up the hill, with a long, straight avenue in front and behind, flanked by noble beeches. A few feet of the walls, with a broken arched chamber, were still to be seen within the memory of man. The more modern mansion-house that stood hard by was burned to the ground while still in the possession of the Murrays \u2014 a circumstance that crowned their misfortunes.\" Craig-Brown says this fire took place somewhere between the years 1764 and 1769, and that the accident was caused by a careless domestic, who put hot ashes in a bucket which she hid be neath a bed. Perhaps it was this same maid who, in her anxiety to save something for the family, threw a valuable looking-glass out of the window, and rushed down stairs carrying a pair of tongs and a poker !

Sir Law rence, on the other hand, curried favour with the souters' wives, and was wont, in saluting them, to drop guineas into their mouths, which induced a knowing dame to sing out, \" Come ower my dochter too, sir ! \" Hangingshaw has always been famed for its splendid trees. In the 'Statistical Account,' pub lished 1833, Dr Russell mentions the following as specimens: \"a plane tree measures in circumference near the root 16 feet, in solid contents 390 square feet; a beech, circumference 13 feet, contents 202 square feet ; a lime, circumference 1 1^* feet, contents 180 square feet; an oak, circumference n feet, con tents 166 square feet.\" But the ancient fame of Hangingshaw for the extent and variety of its trees is no mere tradition : to-day its noble park and avenue contain some of the finest trees in the South of Scotland.

On the height to the north of Hangingshaw is Wallace's Trench, a name that recalls one of the noblest spirits in the Scotch struggle for indepen dence. Shortly after his retreat to Cartland Crags Wallace appeared in the Forest of Ettrick with a large body of men, a fact which is confirmed by a letter dated July 23rd 1297, sent from the English General, Sir Hugh de Cressingham, to King Ed ward, stating that he had urged an attack upon Wallace, who was then lying with a large company in the Forest of Selkirk. The position chosen by the Scotch patriot was a good one \u2014 difficult of access, and a central one for attacking the enemy on either side of the Border. Craig-Brown says of the entrenchment in the Forest \u2014 \"'Wallace's Trench' occupies a skilfully chosen position on the water shed between Tweed and Yarrow, or rather between their tributaries, Glenkinnon Burn and Hanging shaw Burn. It may be said to lie almost direct north and south from the summit to the base of a steep hill called the Brown Knowe on Ordnance Survey Maps. Near the lower end it is intersected by the well known mountain road over Minchmoor, by which Montrose fled with the remnant of his army from the Battle of Philiphaugh.

To lovers of Sir Walter Scott, Abh\u00bb the chief interest of Broadmeadows will lie in a fact mentioned by Lockhart. The chief day dream of Ashiestiel, where Scott lived for ten years, and A contem wrote the ' Lay,' ' Marmion,' and ' Waverley,' was y7dence of not only to be Sheriff of the Forest, but also a Sir Walter \"laird of the cairn and the scaur.\" And while he was writing his 'Lay,' in 1804, it seemed prob able that the estate of Broadmeadows would soon be for sale. Many a time, therefore, \" when summer"], [154, "ETTRICK AND YARROW. 132 smiled on sweet Bowhill,\" he rode round company with Lord and Lady Dalkeith, pating that \u2014 it, in antici- ' There would he sing achievement high And circumstance of chivalry ; And Yarrow, as he rolled along, Bear burden to the minstrel's song.\" The closing lines of the ' Lay ' are also to terpreted by this same day-dream \u2014 be in- \" Hush'd is the harp \u2014 the minstrel gone ; And did he wander forth alone ? . . .

The present mansion house of Broadmeadows, built 1853, in a plain Grecian style, on the slope of a hill, with a thickly wooded background, and fronted by an extensive meadow, is the property of H. M.

Among these beautiful woods, ornate parks, and modern mansions, one almost forgets the proximity of that bare, frowning, mountainous background, made famous by outlaws' depredations, doughty deeds of chivalry, and royal huntings ; but the memory is pleasantly quickened by the sight of the grand old castle of Newark, situated on a peninsula, on the south\" bank of the river, a little way below Broadmeadows. Newark, so named to distinguish it from an ancient pile called Auldwark, built in the vicinity \u2014 according to some, by Alexander III., but probably much earlier \u2014 is a large square tower, now roofless, with outer walls and turrets, in a fair state of preservation.

If this be so, as there are sure references to Newark in the early part of that century, this will be the second Newark since the fall of the \" Auld Wark \""], [157, "NEWARK CASTLE TO ABBOTSFORD. 135 Walter Scott of Buccleuch. keeper of Newark.

In 1473 it came to Margaret of Denmark, Queen of James III., as part of her Forest dowry; and in 1502, in the same manner, it became the prop erty of Margret of England, Queen of James IV. John of Moray, ancestor of the Philiphaugh Murrays, even before it was finished, became custodian of the castle ; and after the Douglases forfeited their rights in the Forest, the Scotts of Buccleuch held the place. Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch, better known as \" Wicked Wat,\" in 1532 refused admit tance to Queen Margret, but latterly yielded to the representations of Henry VIII., and in 1542 he was appointed \" captain and keeper of the place and castle of Newark, with power to make deputes and constables.\" The Buccleuch family ceased to live in the castle about the middle of the 17th century. But the imagination of Sir Walter Scott of Abbotsford has done more to keep green the memory of Newark than all the exploits of kings and feudal lords. He makes it the residence of Anne, Duchess of Buccleuch ; widow of James, Duke of Monmouth, and ancestress of the present Duke. Many a faithful adherent of the Stuart cause owed his safety to this lady, who \" In pride and power, in beauty's bloom, Had wept o'er Monmouth's bloody tomb ; ' and so, out of respect to his friend the Countess of Dalkeith, he makes the last and incomparable minstrel sing his patriotic lay at Newark Castle to the first Duchess of Buccleuch.

But the fire was not so insatiable as the vandal spirit of that miserable factor who, during the minority of Henry, third Duke of Buccleuch, took the beams from the roof, and carted away stones to build a farm-house on Slain Men's Lea. The fifth Duke of Buccleuch was so disgusted at this act of philis tine utility that when he came to power he swept the house away and restored the ancient stones. This, together with the interest of the present Duke, makes Newark the best preserved tower in the Yarrow valley. On the north bank of the river, opposite Newark Tower, and close by the road, at the foot of Foul shiels Hill (1454), are the ruins of a cottage, which no tourist should pass without a becoming mark of respect, for here Mungo Park was born, \" the first of the knight errantry of Africa.\" MUNGO PARK. Park was the seventh child of a family of thirteen, and first saw the light in this humble dwelling, ioth September 1771. Showing signs of exceptional ability, his parents desired that he should enter the ministry, but himself preferring the medical profession, he was apprenticed at the age of fifteen to Mr Thomas Anderson, surgeon in Selkirk. At twenty-one years of age, having finished his medical course in Edinburgh, he obtained the post of assis-"], [159, "NEWARK CASTLE TO ABBOTSFORD 137 tant surgeon on the Worcester, an East Indiaman bound for Sumatra. Upon his return, in 1793, he offered his services to the African society for the investigation of the course and termination of the Niger. He was accepted, and on the 22d of May First 1795, in his twenty-fourth year, he sailed for the jxmuion coast of Senegal. After two and a-half years of (1795). eventful travel, of which one year and a-half had Foulshiels, Mungo Park's Birthplace been passed in the interior of Africa, he returned to England. In June of 1798 he came back to Scot land, where he spent the summer and autumn at Foulshiels, compiling an account of his travels, which appeared in the spring of 1799. Its success was immediate, and added his name to the list of the world's famous explorers. In August of"], [160, "138 ETTRICK AND YARROW Marriage Second African expedition (1805). that same year he was married to Alice, eldest daughter of Dr Anderson, and in the communion roll of Selkirk Parish Church for that month his name appears as a member. In October, 1801, he commenced medical practice in Peebles, in a house at the head of the Briggate. But the fascination of Africa had laid hold of the man, and on the invita tion of Government he resolved to return and complete his task. After some delay he sailed from Portsmouth on the 30th January 1805, taking with him two other sons of the Forest \u2014 Dr Alexander Anderson of Selkirk, his brother-in-law, and Mr George Scott, son of the tenant in Singlie. On the 4th of May 1805, he left Pisania, accompanied by one officer, thirty-five privates, and two seamen from the military station at Goree ; but so severe was the march, that by November 17th only five members of the expedition were alive. Scott never reached the river, but died of fever at Koomikoomi, and Dr Anderson died on the 28th of October during the halt at Sansanding. By the middle of November, he embarked with these five, and two others, in two old canoes rudely joined into one, to form a flat-bottomed boat, which he somewhat facetiously styled \" H.M. Schooner Joliba.\" On the' 19th of this month he writes to Lord Camden, assuring him of his unshaken determination to advance, and in the event of his success, to be in England by May or June of the following year. That same day he writes to his wife, hoping to be in England before she receives his packet, and stating that \"the sails are now being hoisted for our departure to the coast.\" From that date his progress was a life-and death struggle with infuriated men, wild beasts, and"], [161, "NEWARK CASTLE TO ABBOTSFORD. 139 treacherous rapids, shoals and rocks of the river, till about March 1806, passing through a narrow strait on the Niger at Boussa, desperately fighting Death at with the bloodthirsty natives who swarmed the ffjjZfsj banks, their boat rushed upon a hidden rock and there stuck fast. When all escape by fighting was seen to be futile, Park and his companions leapt into the river, and thus the Niger claimed as its own one of the noblest spirits that ever tried to unlock its secrets. Month passed into month, and year to year, but reliable information of these events Uncertainty did not reach Scotland till 1814 ; and even then his nc\"sCf\"t'_l\"s wife did not credit the tragic story, but till the day of her death, thirty years after, clung to the belief that her noble husband was alive, and would some day be found. Joseph Thomson well says of this hero \u2014 \" For actual hardship undergone, for dangers Estimate faced, and difficulties overcome, together with an \u00b0i,a\"aCtey exhibition of the virtues which make a man great in the rude battle of life, Mungo Park stands without a rival.\" In the front wall of the old house a tablet has been inserted by the late Dr Henry Anderson of Selkirk, commemorating the life-work of the famous traveller. Park's own account of his work is told in simple style, but possesses an irresistible charm, and is justly considered a classic on the subject of African travel.

It was found in the bottom of the boat after Park's death, and coming into the possession of an African king, was looked upon as a fetish. Richard Landor, who took up the work of his master, Captain Clapperton, found and brought the book to England. Twenty years after, a Mr Nutland showed it to the Ettrick Shepherd, who to his astonishment read on the title page the name of his friend, Alexander Anderson, in his own writing. Mr Nutland generously gave it to Dr Thomas Anderson, brother of the unfortunate owner. It was almost impossible that such a man as Mungo Park should not be on terms of intimacy with Walter Scott, the literary Sheriff of the shire. This personal acquaintance was formed in the autumn of 1804; the two soon became much attached, and Scott used to tell many a character istic anecdote of his friend. An incident recorded by Lockhart gives the deep pools that reflect the pomp of cultivated nature below Newark Tower quite a melancholy interest. Calling one day at Foulshiels, and not finding Park at home, Scott walked in search of him along the banks of the Yarrow. Presently he discovered his friend stand ing alone on the bank plunging one stone after another into the water, and watching anxiously the bubbles as they rose to the surface. \" This,\" said Scott, \" appears but an idle amusement for one who has seen so much stirring adventure.\" \" Not so idle, perhaps, as you suppose,\" answered Mungo, \"this was the manner in which I used to ascertain the depth of a river in Africa before I ventured Intimacy between Park and Sir Walter Scott.

Below Foulshiels, on the north bank of the river, stands the charming villa of Harewoodglen, built by the first Lady Murray as dower -house for herself, about the year 1851, on strictly entailed ground. It is in the Italian style, on a steep rocky bank, embosomed in \"rich groves of lofty stature,\" and commands a delightful prospect of that part of Yarrow described by William Wordsworth in the sixth and seventh verses of ' Yarrow Visited.' The actual scene may vie with any account of fairy witchery ; \u2022 it is not only the most picturesque and romantic bit of scenery in Yarrow, but it is a question what vale can match it for grace and charm. It well merits Wordsworth's praise \u2014 \"But thou, that didst appear so fair To fond imagination, Dost rival in the light of day Her delicate creation.\" For centuries this portion of Yarrow's braes formed a part of the Philiphaugh estate. After the second Lady Murray's death, Harewoodglen reverts to the Philiphaugh family, viz., the present Baronet, or his son Archibald. The farm of Harehead, hard by, is an old Forest stead, for centuries in the Murrays' possession. It appears in the pages of Pitcairn as more than once"], [164, "ETTRICK AND YARROW. 142 The General's Bridge. Carter haugh. Meeting of Yarrow and Ettrick ravaged by Border thieves.

It forms the western boundary of the Philiphaugh lands, and in 1701 Murray of that ilk was estab lished in possession by Act of Parliament. It is now the property of Mr Strang Steel, who a few years ago purchased the Philiphaugh estate. A short distance down the valley from Harehead the General's Bridge spans the Yarrow.

What Tiber was to the Roman, Jordan to the Jew, and what the Rhine is to the German, so is Yarrow to the Scot. The wooded heights of Philiphaugh can now be seen on the left of the route, with the mansion-house of that name standing on a commanding position overlooking the rivers Ettrick and Yarrow just at the meeting of their waters. Philiphaugh can be better identified with the history of the county than any other Forest stead. In the Exchequer Rolls, under the date 1265, it is mentioned as \" Fulhope,\" contributing 6s 8d to the King's exchequer. There is a story that one William Rule saved Robert the Bruce from being gored by an infuriated bull, and that ever after he was known as William \" Turn bul.\" To this man, about 1315, the Bruce granted certain lands at the west end of \" Fulhopehalch.\" For three hundred years after, these Turnbulls were on the lands of Philiphaugh. Another charter grants the eastern part of \"Fulhopehalch\" to a William Barbitonsor (a barber) in 13 14; also to him and his heirs the office of Constable of Selkirk, to be held at the royal pleasure. T. Craig-Brown seeks to connect a son of the above with John Barbour (1316-1395), a contemporary of Chaucer and Gower, who wrote the patriotic epic, \" The Bruce ; ' thus seeking to link another great Scotch poet with the traditions of Yarrow. But the name most associated with Philiphaugh is that of Murray. T. Craig-Brown in his 'Chronicles of the Forest,' from which these facts are extracted, gives a long and accurate account of this old Selkirk family. The"], [166, "ETTRICK AND YARROW. 144 Murrays of Philip haugh. Sir James Murray. Murrays obtained a footing in the Forest in 1461, though for a century and a half previously they had an influential position in Mid-Lothian. In direct unbroken male descent, no Selkirkshire house traces to a remoter age, the present baronet being twenty- first in uninterrupted line, father and son, from his first mentioned progenitor, Archibald de Moravia, a signatory of Ragman's Roll in 1296. It is prob- able that the family spread over Scotland from the northern district of Moray, and some surmise that Moray derived its name from certain pre-historic settlers hailing from Moravia in Austria. The descendants of this family held the Sheriffdom of the Forest from the middle of the 15th century. John Murray of Falahill was the first to be con- nected with the shire, acquiring Philiphaugh by royal charter, dated 1461 ; while in 1462 he was made herd-keeper to the Queen Regent, Mary of Gueldres. John, grandson of the above, and said to be the famous \"outlaw\" of the ballad, was for- mally installed in the Sheriffdom, on November 30th 1509, by King James IV. As mentioned in the note on Hangingshaw, he was slain in 1510 at the insti gation of \" Wicked Wat \" of Buccleuch. Sir James Murray was M.P. for Selkirkshire in 1678, and again in 1681. For being remiss in punishing conventicles he was deprived of his Sheriffship in 1681, and he was committed to prison in 1684 for participating in the Rye-House Plot. Threatened at his examination with the torture of \"the boot,\" he made confession and turned King's evidence. In the year 1689 he was appointed an ordinary Lord of Session, and took his seat on November ist as Lord Philiphaugh.

By expenses incurred in contesting the Selkirk group of burghs, money lost in speculation, horse racing, and extravagant living, he dissipated his fortune, and in the end the burning of Hangingshaw effectually ruined him. He sold Hangingshaw to Mr Johnstone of Alva, and some of his other lands to other purchasers. After re siding for a time in Philiphaugh House he went to the West Indies, and in a few years returned with sufficient money to repurchase his old estate of Hangingshaw, but could not acquire it. Captain James Murray (father of the late Sir Captain John) was third son of John Murray, M.P. (who -jj^ sold Hangingshaw). There was John \"the Doctor\" and Charles before him. He went into the Royal Navy when ten years old, and was senior lieu tenant at twenty, when he joined the East India Company. Captain Murray had over -\u00a340,000 invested in the East India Company Service. His ship, the \" Devonshire,\" which was freighted for China, went down in the roads off Calcutta, with all his valuables and family plate, and with twenty of the crew.

Sir John Murray, son of Captain James, and who became Baronet of Philiphaugh and Mel gund, was born in 1817, and died in 1882. In 1863 he was served heir-male to his kinsman, Sir Joseph Albert Murray, Baronet, Count of the Austrian Empire, since whose death, without issue, in 1848, the baronetcy had lain dormant. Count Murray's wife was a daughter of the princely house of Esterhazy. Immediately after his accession, he began to beautify the barren slopes of the estate with timber, and to improve its extensive marsh and heath into arable land, thus doing much to enhance the amenity of the whole district, and also to make Philiphaugh one of the most beautiful domains in Scotland.

John Murray to the memory of those Covenanters who fell at the Battle of Philiphaugh. This battle, the last to take place in the Forest of Ettrick, was fought here September 13th, 1645. The chroniclers differ considerably as to whether the battle was a surprise or a pre-arranged attack, but briefly the outstanding facts are as follows :\u2014 Montrose, after six successive battles and victories that practically laid Scotland at his feet, marched to the Borders in the expectation of meeting a body of regular cavalry promised from England, and of recruiting others among the friends of the cause ; for the High- land clans had returned to their farms and to the enjoyment of the spoils of victory. On the repre- sentations of the Scottish Parliament, General David Leslie, at the head of five or six thousand well-disciplined troops, was sent to check his pro gress. He crossed the Borders at Berwick and marched for Edinburgh, but learning that Montrose was encamped near Selkirk, he diverted his march southward, and passing down Gala Water quartered his army the night before the battle at Melrose, about seven miles distant from the scene of conflict. The course of the Ettrick, after receiving the waters of the Yarrow, is more directly eastwards, and thus there is formed an extensive plain on the left bank of the river, two miles in length and from a quarter to half a mile broad, defended on the north by the hills that separate the Tweed and Yarrow valleys, to the west by the thickly wooded height called Harehead Wood, and to the east by the Philiphaugh and Linglie hills extending nearly to the river. This spacious plain is known as the battle ground of Philiphaugh. Here Montrose had"], [170, "ETTRICK AND YARROW. 148 Montrose defeated by Sir David Leslie.

By break of day on the following morning, the Covenanters' force were on the march from Melrose, and having got within a mile of the Royalist army, Leslie, under cover of a thick mist, sent 2000 of his troops across the Ettrick and up the ravine between Philiphaugh and Linglie hills, to attack the left flank of the Royalists, while after a sufficient delay so as to make the onslaught simultaneous, he ordered a general advance, and, according to the Royalist historian, appeared un expectedly before Montrose's infantry, who made a gallant stand. The unfriendly spirit of the district to the Royalist cause is seen in the fact that Montrose was not apprised of the calamity that had befallen his troops till roused by the noise of the firing. He hastened to the scene with what he could gather of his cavalry, and made desperate attempts to rally his men, but to little purpose. The battle raged furiously along the plain and on the hill-side, in the direction of the present Philip haugh House. \" Eh,\" a fierce Covenanter is credited with saying, \" but the wark goes bonnily on.\" Montrose, seeing that the surprise had been complete, and decisive as disastrous, cut his way through the conquerors, and, crossing the hills by Minchmoor with a few of his followers, escaped to Traquair.

The other is Abbotsford Ferry, facing, on the opposite bank of Tweed the mansion-house of Abbotsford, that \"romance in stone and lime \" so inseparably associated with the ambition and genius of the great Minstrel of the Border. Here from the meadow land across the river, and amid the trees planted by Sir Walter Scott, rise the octagonal towers and crow-stepped gables of Abbotsford. This haugh land, possessing the unpoetical name of Clarty Hole, was bought by the poet on the security of the proceeds of 'Rokeby' in 1811, and immediately re-named Abbotsford from a ford, so called, just above the influx of Gala Water with Tweed. The new name tells the secret of the choice. It was a poet's purchase, not that of a cool, calculating, economic mind. The land had once belonged to the monks of Melrose, whose Abbey ruins stood near by, containing the dust of Alexander IL, the Wizard Scott, the noble house of Douglas, and above all, there rested the Bruce's heart. Through these fields, with the uneuphonious designation, there ran an ancient Roman road to the Eildon's triple height, where Druids had offered sacrifice from their mountain altars, where Roman legions had encamped, and in whose hidden caverns the British King Arthur and his chivalrous knights lay awaiting the bugle call to break their enchantment and give them new quests.

As money came in from the proceeds of his pen, the Abbotsford original cottage and few fields became an estate of several miles in length and 1200 acres in ex tent, including on the east, behind Huntly Burn, the Rhymer's Glen, where True Thomas met Rhymer the Queen of Faerie, and was translated by her _** for seven years to the realms of Elfland.

Every nook and cranny of the pile is a subject for study, as in the most unexpected places are to be found relics of the rarest value. Within, the rooms are replete with priceless treasures collected by the poet himself. The armoury is of a unique interest, the library contains the most precious medi\u00e6val lore, the museum is enriched with relics consecrated by choicest memories ; but the chief interest of Abbots ford and district lies in the fact that here Walter Scott, the most representative Scotchman of his time, displayed to the world a fertility of genius unsur passed since Shakespeare lived, and struggled nobly and successfully with most undeserved misfortunes. Here he sought to realise his \" first and last worldly ambition,\" the founding of a distinct branch of the house of Scott, a desire not to be gratified. But he did more than that ; he made the whole civilised world his debtor. And here, in the midst of his strife with fate, as heroic as that of his own match less knights, there came in 1830 and in 1831 strokes of paralysis, \"a-shaking hands with death.\" A hasty retreat to the kindlier air of Naples proved unavailing. Impelled by a patriotic yearning for the scenes he loved best, he hurriedly returned to Abbotsford; and there, on the 21st of September 1832, with all his children around him, Sir Walter Scott entered upon his last sleep.

This deservedly popular lyric, among the Songs of the Border second only to the ' Flowers of the Forest,' was published for the first time in Hogg's ' Forest Minstrel,' in 1810. In some editions, the \"Glen\" of the second verse is printed with a capital \" G, \" in accordance with a theory for which there is no proof, and the same amount of probability, that the glen alluded to is the mansion-house of Sir Charles Tennant, Bart., on the banks of the Quair. The word is not so printed in the first edition of Hogg's ' Minstrel.' The Ettrick Shepherd added the last eight lines of the song, and it is generally believed that he is the young Jamie referred to.

As doun the burnside she gaed slow wi' her flittin', \"Fare ye weel, Lucy,\" was ilka bird's sang. She heard the craw sayin't, high on the tree sittin', And Robin was chirpin't the brown leaves amang. \"Oh! what is't that pits my puir heart in a flutter? An' what gars the tear come sae fast to my e'e ? If I wasna ettled to be ony better, Then what gars me wish ony better to be ?

Between me and the sunken sun, Where gloaming gathered in the meadows, Contented cattle, red aud dun, Were slowly browsing in the shadows. And out beyond them Newark reared Its quiet tower against the sky, As if its walls had never heard Of wassail-rout or battle cry. O'er moss-grown roofs that once had rung To reiver's riot, Border brawl, The slumberous shadows mutely hung, And silence deepened over all. Above the high horizon bar A cloud of golden mist was lying, And over it a single star Soared heavenward as the day was dying."], [219, "YARROW BALLADS AND SONGS, 197 No sound, no word, from field or ford, Nor breath of wind to float a feather, While Yarrow's murmuring waters poured A lonely music through the heather. In silent fascination bound, As if some mighty spell obeying, The hills stood listening to the sound, And wondering what the stream was saying. What secret to the inner ear, What happier message is it bringing, With more of hope, and less of fear, Than men dare mix with earthly singing ?

Professor Veitch says of this Forest district that it belongs to the central part of the old Silurian or greywacke system of rock that stretches from Loch Ryan on the south-west to St Abb's Head on the north-east, from the western sea to the German Ocean. It is an old sea bed, and the rock of which the hills are composed is of the lower or older kind, next in antiquity to the Cambrian and Laurentian. This Silurian rock is the basis of the whole strata of the district ; and any subsequent deposit at later periods, such as sandstone, has been laid in the hollows scooped out of this primitive rock. The land is now very much as it was left by the sea and as it has been shaped by ice, water, and sub atmospheric influences, since the earliest geological period. In Mr T. Craig-Brown's ' Chronicles of the Forest,' Mr James Wilson says: \"The rocks of Selkirkshire, being all of Silurian age, do not offer to the geological student as many attractions as those of the counties which touch its boundaries, each of which presents, along with Silurian strata,"], [239, "GEOLOGY, MINERALOGY, AND BOTANY. 217 more or less of succeeding formations, up to the Permian. Not only is the rock structure less varied, and the range of life less extensive in the Selkirk area than in these, but its fossils, generally speaking, are confined to narrow bands, lying in enormous masses of beds, which reveal nothing to the pal\u00e6ontologist. As yet, even after careful search, the rocks in the eastern portion of the county, and south of the river Ettrick, have yielded no recognisable fossil except protovirgidaria \u2014 abund- ant in some bands \u2014 though in the western section of the shire, in the small valley formed by Rankle Burn, the same beds have yielded a few monoprianidian graptalites of Llandovery types. . . . Igneous rocks in dyke form occur in many places in the county, but these are not of much consequence, economically or geologically. The most important is a dyke much more recent than any of the strata it cuts. It extends from the Cheviots in a line a little north of due west to Hawiek, passes through the Teviot near the middle of the town, runs up Wilton Burn, through Mabon Law, near Old Harden, Borthwickshiel Burn, crosses the Ale a quarter of a mile south of Whitslade, goes through the Craigs, and disappears about half a mile south of the Pot Loch, and about three quarters of a mile west from Gildiesgreen. We are not aware of the existence of metalliferous veins in the county. There may be lead in Windlestrae Law, as beds which yield lead ore at Grieston pass through that hill. In Prieston Hill several thick bands of quartz rock occur, but no gold is discernible in it with an ordinary lens.\" (But see introductory note to 'Down Yarrow.')"], [240, "ETTRICK AND YARROW. 218 ETTRICK. Though no interesting fossils or minerals have been found in the district, a piece of antimony glance was picked up in the channel of a little burn near the source of the Ettrick some time ago, but though considerable search has been made since, no more has yet been found. Iron pyrites has also been collected in the romantic linns of the Ettrick. At Meucra, near the head of the Loch of the Lowes, a black rock has been sometimes visited by the admirers of nature, which some have pro nounced to be glossy alum slate ; it has the appearance of bone. Almost every kind of soil is to be met with here. But there is in general a deep moss on the top of the hills. This becomes, by mixture of sand or gravel, mossy, gravelly soil. There is often again a cold stiff clay on the sides, or near to the bottom of the hills ; this again by mixture of sand or gravel forms a new and different kind of bed for the plants and grasses. But the haughs on the sides of the river are in general of a fine alluvial soil, washed from the hills and formed on the banks. The soil, indeed, of whatever kind, is in general good, and would bear crops of wheat. But the climate being cold, damp, and late, we could not expect it to ripen ; therefore no such crop is ever attempted to be raised. The kinds of the natural wood must have been very numerous.

The general direction of the strata is from south-west to north east, but it often varies for a short way. The dip is generally 450, though it ranges from the perpen dicular to the horizontal. A great part of the soil is a light, hazel-coloured -loam, formed from the decomposition of the rocks, and much mixed with stones. It is common on the sides of the hills and the gentle acclivities along their base. In some places there are Trifolium repens, Bellis perennis, Plantago lanceolata, &c, which make an ex cellent pasture. Where it is deep, Polypodium Vid gare is found in abundance, but, where thin and exposed, it is apt to be overrun with muscis. On the sunny slopes, as Wardlaw Craig, Catslackburnhill, Deucharhope, &c, Cistus Helianthemum, or the rock rose, sometimes covers the surface to the exclusion of almost every other plant ; and in fine seasons, between June and July, a whole hill-side is one entire yellow blow.

Still, with patience and art, fish may be had on either Ettrick or Yarrow ; and should your sport be slow you can always solace yourself with the chance of standing on the bank where Jamie Telfer, Wat of Harden, the Ettrick Shepherd, Christopher North, or per chance the Wizard Michael Scott, lured the finny tribe from streams now haunted by legend and musical with song. We can only hope that if you fish in Clearburn Loch you may not meet the water"], [244, "ETTRICK AND YARROW. 222 cow, and that the salmo irritans will not trouble you in the streams. \" There's an accommodating fish, In pool or stream, by rock or pot, Who rises frequent as you wish At 'Popham,' ' Parson,' or 'Jock Scott; Or almost any fly you've got In all the furred and feathered clans. You strike, but ah, you strike him not, He is the salmo irritans ! ETTRICK AND ITS TRIBUTARIES. The river Ettrick runs for twenty-eight miles in a north-easterly direction to the Tweed, which it enters about a mile above Abbotsford. From that point upwards to its junction with Yarrow there are many good trouting streams and pools, but being so near the town of Selkirk, they are much fished. From the junction of Ettrick and Yarrow to the village of Ettrickbridgend, a distance of five miles, the water is preserved. Above the village, to Tushielaw, the river has good large trout, and gives plenty of scope for worm or fly fishing ; and towards the spawning season, salmon and sea trout add to the excitement, as they push their way far up the river. For a considerable distance above the vil lage the river bed is rough, and forms numerous deep pools, well stocked with good trout. Above Newhouse the river is shallower, but contains many excellent casts. The principal tributaries are not numerous \u2014 the Bailie Burn, on the south bank of the river, near the village ; and Singlie, on the"], [245, "HINTS TO ANGLERS. 223 north bank ; also Hyndhope and Deloraine Burns on the south bank of the river, and Crosslee on the north bank. These are all small streams, but, especially after being flooded, they afford a few hours good fishing. The Rankle Burn runs from its source among the moors, swelled by the tributary rills of a lonely though famous glen, for a distance of eight miles, and enters the Ettrick to the west of Tushie law Inn, eight miles from Ettrickbridgend. The Rankle Burn is one of the best fishing streams in the valley, having abundant trout, running from a quarter to half a pound. Three miles up the glen, Clearburn joins the Rankleburn. Good trout are often caught in this stream, as they come out of the Clearburn Loch. From Tushielaw to Tima, a distance of three miles, the river affords good fish ing. There are many deep pools, stocked with good-sized trout, that are not over shy. The Tima is the largest tributary that flows into the Ettrick, which it enters a mile below Ettrick Kirk, having traversed the glen for six miles in a northward direction ; it contains plenty of small-sized trout. The streamlets running to the Tima best suited for fishing are the Glenkerry and Dalgleish Burns. The river above this narrows considerably, and is best suited for worm fishing; but it contains a plentiful supply of average small-sized trout. Et trick has also a succession of lochs, most of which yield good sport to the angler ; perhaps the best of them is Acremoor, to the north-east of the Shaws estate, in which the trout, though scarce, are large ; and the Shaws lochs, in which there are both trout and perch. Permission may be had to fish the Shaws lochs from the proprietor, Mr Anderson."], [246, "224 ETTRICK AND YARROW. Clearburn Loch, which is situated a short distance to the north-east, has a quaggy bottom, pierced by numerous springs, and, being surrounded by reeds of a great height, is, save for a small bit on the eastern side, almost unfishable. But to the en thusiastic angler the interesting thing about it is that it certainly has plenty of large-sized trout. YARROW AND ITS TRIBUTARIES. Fly fishing begins somewhat late in Yarrow, and is rather precarious. As a rule the trout are of a good size and plentiful, but shy. The three miles of water from the junction of Yarrow and Ettrick are strictly preserved, so that, to begin a day's fishing, five miles of walking from Selkirk has to be done. Generally the fisher can get a lift by the coach, post-gig, or a passing van. The river above Yarrowford is difficult to fish, on account of the many trees lining the banks, but good large trout may be had before reaching Lewinshope Burn', upwards of a mile beyond the village. This burn is well supplied with small trout, but the river between it and Deuchar Mill, a distance of two miles, is too tempting to waste time here. At the old bridge beyond the mill there is a fine pool with plenty of trout, but it is only when the water is coloured, or with a favouring wind, that they are to be got in any great number. Whitehope Burn, on the north bank of the river, a short distance to the west of Yarrow Kirk, has plenty of small trout. For a mile and a half beyond this the river is shallow,"], [247, "HINTS TO ANGLERS. 225 and does not afford much fishing ; but from Cats lackburn, at this point, almost till we reach Mount benger Burn, a distance of two miles, there are a number of good pools and streams, with fine big fish, and, the banks being clear, there is every facility for good sport. A short walk now brings us to the Gordon Arms Inn, a great resort for anglers who intend fishing the upper reaches of Yarrow. From the inn to Douglas Burn at the Craig of Douglas, is a good stretch of river, and trout are plentiful in it. The distance is a little over a mile. On the south bank of the river, half way between Gordon Arms and the Craig of Douglas, is Eldinhope Burn, which also has good trout. Many anglers cross the bridge at the inn and fish up the river till they come to this burn ; and this, together with its tributaries, supplies a good day's fishing. The Douglas Burn, rising in the Dun Rig, runs a course of six miles before it reaches the Yarrow, of which it is the principal tributary. It is a good burn, and under favourable condi tions will well reward the angler with a good basket. Less than a mile and a half above the Craig is Kirkstead Burn, running into the foot of St Mary's Loch. It contains fair trout, and after a flood will give a few hours good sport. St Mary's Loch, 7^* miles in circumference and three miles in length, can be fished to its whole extent ; but the historic takes of James Hogg and Chris topher North are only revived as devout memories. Fine-sized trout, however, may yet be caught in it, the most favourable periods being during the month of April and in the evenings of June. As in all other lochs and calm water, a dull cloudy day, i*"], [248, "226 ETTRICK AND YARROW. and a light breeze, causing a gentle ripple of the surface, is the time for the angler to ply his arts. The adjoining Loch of the Lowes, a mile in length and a quarter of a mile broad, has few trout, but abounds in perch, and affords every opportunity for amusement to those who can find sport in kill ing them. Some of the best stream fishing may be done in the loch district. Whithope and Cross cleuch burns, on the south shore of the Loch of the Lowes, sometimes yield good trout ; and from the Little Yarrow, which enters the Lowes at the west end, many large fish are taken, especially after or during a flood. But by far the best stream is Meggat Water, which, rising among the Peebles shire hills, empties itself into St Mary's Loch to the east of Rodono Hotel. When the Meggat is in flood, great numbers of trout from the loch pass up the stream and its principal tributaries \u2014 \u2014 Glengaber to the north, rising in Red Syke Head, and Winterhope, on the south, where they may be easily caught. On the authority of Andrew Lang, the Glengaber trout are good strong fellows that give great sport to the angler. These are the principal fishing grounds up Yarrow \u2014 these, with the dark tarn Loch Skene, which abounds in small fish; but, except under favourable conditions of wind and weather, it offers little hope of capturing many \" aldermen.\""], [249, "of Distances \u2014 &ttriek etad sarroro.
