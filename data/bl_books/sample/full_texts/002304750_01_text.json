Meanwhde, in 1846, the year in which he was called to the bar, he edited the \" Poets and Dramatists of Ireland,\" with an in- troduction, which evinced considerable reading, on the early religion and literature of the Irish people. In the same year he also edited the \" Book of Irish Ballads,\" to which he prefixed an introduction on ballad poetry. This volume was republished with additions and a preface in 1869. In 1853, the poems afterwards published under the title of \" Under glimpses\" were chiefly written.* * The subjective view of nature developed in these Poems has been censured as remote from human interest. Yet a critic of deep insight, George Gilfillan, declares his special admira tion for \"the joyous, sunny, lark-like carols on May, almost worthy of Shelley, and such delicate, tender, Moore-like trifles (shall I call them?) as All Fools' Day.

The plays of Calderon \u2014 thoroughly national in form and matter \u2014 have met with but scant ap preciation from foreigners. Yet we find his genius recognized in unexpected quarters, Goethe and Shelley uniting with Augustus Schlegel and Archbishop Trench to pay him homage. My father was, I think, first led to the study of Calderon by Shelley's glowing eulogy of the poet (\" Essays,\" vol. h., p. 274, and elsewhere). The Sir William Rowan Hamilton on another poem of the same class. His remarks are interesting in themselves, as coming from one illustrious as a man of science, and, at the same time, a true poet\u2014 a combination which may hereafter become more frequent, since already in the vast regions of space and time brought within human ken, imagination strives hard to keep pace with established fact. In a manuscript volume now in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, he writes, under date, May, 1848 : \u2014 \" The University Magazine for the present month contains a poem which delights one, entitled 'The Bridal of the Year.' It is signed ' t). V- ni. C.,' as is also a shorter, but almost a sweeter piece immediately following it, and headed, 'Summer Longings.' Sir William goes through the whole poem, copying and criticising every stanza, and concludes as follows : \u2014 \"After a very pretty ninth stanza respecting the 'fairy phantoms' in the poet's 'glorious visions seen,' which the author conceives to ' follow the poet's steps beneath the"], [13, "PREFACE.

' ' Her eyes are heaven, her robes are sunbeams, and with these physical aspects of the May, how well does the author of this ode (for such, surely, we may term the poem, so rich in lyrical enthusiasm and varied melody) conceive the combina tion as bridesmaids, as companions to the bride ; of those mental feelings, those new buddings of hope in the heart which the season is fitted to awaken. The azure eyes glitter back to ours, for the planets shine upon us from the lovely summer night ; but lovelier still are those 'dreams delicious, joys from some serener star,' which at the same sweet season float down invisibly, and win their entrance to our souls. The image of a bridal, is happily and naturally kept before us in the re maining stanzas of this poem, which well deserve to be copied here, in continuation of these notes \u2014 the former for its cheer fulness, the latter for its sweetness.

They consist* of fifteen complete plays, which I believe to be the largest amount of translated verse by any one author, that has ever appeared in English. Most of it is in the difficult assonant or vowel rhyme, hardly ever previously attempted in our language. This may be a fitting place to cite a few testimonies as to the execution of the work. Longfellow, whom I have myself heard speak of the \"Autos\" in a way that showed how deeply he had studied them in the original, wrote, in 1857 : \" You are doing this work admirably, and seem to gain new * The following are the titles and dates of publication : In 1853, \"The Constant Prince,\" \" The Secret in Words,\" \" The Physician of his own Honour,\" \"Love after Death,\" \"The Purgatory of St. Patrick,\" \"The Scarf and the Flower.\" In 1861, \"The Greatest Enchantment,\" \"The Sorceries of Sin,\" \" Devotion of the Cross.\" In 1867, \"Bel shazzar's Feast,\" \" The Divine Philothea\" (with Essays from the\" German of Lorinser, and the Spanish of Gonzales Pedroso).

XI strength and sweetness as you go on. It seems as if Calderon himself were behind you whispering and suggesting. And what better work could you do in your bright hours or in your dark hours than just this, which seems to have been put pro videntially into your hands.\" Again, in 1862 : \"Your new work in the vast and flowery fields of Calderon is, I think, admirable, and presents the old Spanish dramatist before the English reader in a very attractive light. Particularly in the most poetical passages you are excellent ; as, for instance, in the fine description of the gerfalcon and the heron in 'El Mayor Encanto.' I hope you mean to add more and more, so as to make the translation as nearly complete as a single life will permit. It seems rather appalling to under take the whole of so voluminous a writer ; never theless, I hope you will do it. Having proved that you can, perhaps you ought to do it. This may be your appointed work. It is a noble one.\"* Ticknor (\" History of Spanish Literature,\" new edition, vol. hi., p. 461) writes thus : \" Calderon \u2022 When the author of \" Evangeline\" visited Europe for the last time in 1868, they met in Italy.

Mr. MacCarthy has done this, I conceive, to a degree which I had previously supposed impossible. Nothing, I think, in the English language will give us so true an impression of what is most characteristic of the Spanish drama ; perhaps I ought to say, of what is most characteristic of Spanish poetry generally.\" Another eminent Hispaniologist (Mr. C. F. Brad ford, of Boston) has spoken of the work in similar terms. His labours did not pass without recogni tion from the great dramatist's countrymen. He was elected a member of the Real Academia some years ago, and in 1881 this learned body presented him with the medal struck in commemoration of Calderon's bicentenary, \"in token of their grati tude and their appreciation of his translations of the great poet's works.\" In 1855, at the request of the Marchioness of Donegal, my father wrote the ode which was re cited at the inauguration of the statue of her son, the Earl of Belfast.

The Lectures on the Poets of Spain, and on the Dramatists of the Sixteenth Century, were de livered a few years later. In 1862 he published a curious bibliographical treatise on the \" Memoires of the Marquis de Vfflars.\" In 1864 the ill health of some of his family necessitated his leav ing his home near Kill in ey Hill* to reside on the Continent. In 1872, \" Shelley's Early Life\" was published in London, where he had settled, attracted by the facilities for research which its great libraries offered. This biography gives an amusing account of the young poet's visit to Dublin in 1812, and some new details of his ad ventures and writings at this period. My father's admiration for Shelley was of long standing. At the age of seventeen he wrote some lines to the poet's memory, which appeared in the Dublin Satirist already mentioned, and an elaborate review of his poetry in an early number of the Nation.

He re turned to Ireland a few months before his death, which took place at Blackrock, near Dublin, on April 7th*, in the present year. His nature was most sensitive, but though it was his lot to suffer many sorrows, I never heard a complaint or an unkind word from his lips. From what has been said it will be evident that this volume contains only a part of his poetical works, it having been found impossible to include the humorous pieces, parodies, and epigrams, without some acquaintance with which an im perfect idea would be formed of his genius. The same may be said of his numerous trans lations from various languages (exclusive of Calderon's plays). Of those published in 1850, \" The Romance of Maleca,\" \" Saint George's Knight,\" \"The Christmas of the Foreign Child,\" and others have been frequently reprinted.

His translations from the Latin, chiefly of medi\u00e6val hymns, are also numerous. In inserting the poem of \"Ferdiah\" I was influenced by its subject as well as by the wish of friends.

An Episode from the Ancient Irish Epic Romance, \"The Tain Bo Guailgne; or, the Cattle Prey of Guailgne.\" [\" The Tain B6 Chuailgni\" says the late Professor O'Curry, \" is to Irish what the Argonautic Expedition, or the Seven against Thebes, is to Grecian history.\" For an account of this, perhaps the earliest epic romance of Western Europe, see the. Professor's \" Lectureson the Manuscript Materials of Irish History.\" The Fight of Cuchullin with Ferdiah took place in the modern county of Louth, at the ford of Ardee, which still preserves the name of the departed champion, Ardee being the softened form of Ath Ferdiah, or Ferdiah 's Ford. The circumstances under which this famous combat took place are thus succinctly mentioned by O'Curry, in his descrip tion of the TainB6 Cuailgni : \u2014 \"Cuchulainn confronts the invaders of his province, de mands single combat, and conjures his opponents by the laws of Irish chivalry (the Mr comhtainn) not to advance farther until they had conquered Aim.. This demand, in accordance with the Irish laws of warfare, is granted ; and then the whole contest is resolved into a succession of single combats, in each of which Cuchulainn was victorious.\" \u2014 \"Lectures,\" p. 37. The original Irish text of this episode, with a literal trans lation, on which the present metrical version is founded, may be consulted in the appendix to the second series of the Lectures by O'Curry, vol. ii., p. 413. The date assigned to the famous expedition of the Tain B6 Cuailgni, and consequently to the episode which forms the subject of the present poem, is the close of the century imme diately preceding the commencement of the Christian era. This will account for the complete absence of all Christian allusions, so remarkable throughout the poem : an additional proof, if that were required, of its extreme antiquity.] * This poem is now published for the first time in its complete state."], [68, "40 FERDIAH.

The dwellers in Ferdiah's tent that night Were scant of comfort, a foreboding fear Fell on their spirits and their hearts weighed down ; Because they knew in whatsoever fight The mighty chiefs, the hundred-slaying two Met face to face, that one of them must fall, Or both, perhaps, or if but only one, Certain were they it would their own lord be, Since on the Tain B6 Guailgne', it was plain That no one with Cuchullin could contend. Nor was their chief less troubled ; but at first The fumes of the late revel overpowered His senses, and he slept a heavy sleep. Later he woke, the intoxicating steam Had left his brain, and now in sober calm All the anxieties of the impending fight Pressed on his soul and made him grave.* He rose From off his couch, and bade his charioteer Harness his pawing horses to the car.

Now of Cuchullin will I speak. He rose Not until day with all its light had come, In order that the men of Erin ne'er Should say of him that it was fear or dread That made him from a restless couch arise. When in the fulness of its light at length Shone forth the day, he bade his charioteer Harness his horses and his chariot yoke. \"Harness my horses, good, my servant,\" said Cuchullin, \" and my chariot yoke for me, For lo ! an early-rising champion comes To meet us here beside the Ford to-day \u2014 Ferdiah, son of Daman, Dare's son.\" \" My lord, the steeds are ready to thy hand; Thy chariot stands here yoked, do thou step in ; The noble car will not disgrace its lord.\" Into the chariot, then, the dextrous, bold, Red-sworded, battle- winning hero sprang Cuchullin, son of Sualtam, at a bound. Invisible Bocanachs and Bananachs, And Geniti Glindi* shouted round the car, And demons of the earth and of the air. For thus the Tuatha de Danaans used By sorceries to raise those fearful cries Around him, that the terror and the fear Of him should be the greater, as he swept On with his staff of spirits to the war. *In the \"Battle of Magh Leana\" these mysterious beings are called \"the Women of the Valley\" (p. 120),"], [81, "FERDIAH. 53 Soon was it when Ferdiah's charioteer Heard the approaching clamour and the shout, The rattle and the clatter, and the roar, The whistle, and the thunder, and the tramp, The clanking discord of the missive shields, The clang of swords, the hissing sound of spears The tinkling of the helmet, the sharp crash Of armour and of arms, the straining ropes, The dangling bucklers, the resounding wheels, The creaking chariot, and the proud approach Of the triumphant champion of the Ford. Clutching his master's robe, the charioteer Cried out, \" Ferdiah, rise ! for lo, thy foes Are on thee !\" Then the Spirit of Insight fell Prophetic on the youth, and thus he sang. Charioteer.

Not long Ferdiah's charioteer had gazed With wondering look on the majestic car, When, as with thunder-speed it wheeled more near, He saw its whole construction and its plan : A fair, flesh-seeking, four-peaked front it had, And for its body a magnificent creit Fashioned for war, in which the hero stood Full-armed and brandishing a mighty spear, While o'er his head a green pavilion hung ; Beneath, two fleetly-bounding, large- eared, fierce, Whale-bellied, lively-hearted, high-flanked, proud, Slender-legged, wide-hoofed, broad-bnttocked, pranc- ing steeds, Exulting leaped and bore the car along : Under one yoke, the broad-backed steed was gray, Under the other, black the long-maned steed. Like to a hawk swooping from off a cliff, Upon a day of harsh and biting wind, Or like a spring gust on a wild March morn Rushing resistless o'er a level plain, Or like the fleetness of a stag when first 'Tis started by the hounds in its first field \u2014 So swept the horses of Cuchullin's car, Bounding as if o'er fiery flags they flew, Making the earth to shake beneath their tread, And tremble 'neath the fleetness of their speed. At length, upon the north side of the Ford, Cuchullin stopped. Upon the southern bank"], [84, "56 FERDIAH. Ferdiah stood, and thus addressed the chief : \" Glad am I, 0 Cuchullin, thou hast come.\" \"Up to this day,\" Cuchullin made reply, \" Thy welcome would by me have been received As coming from a friend, but not to-day. Besides, 'twere fitter that I welcomed thee, Than that to me thou shouldst the welcome give ; 'Tis I that should go forth to fight with thee, Not thou to me, because before thee are My women and my children, and my youths, My herds and flocks, my horses and my steeds.\" Ferdiah, half in scorn, spake then these words \u2014 And then Cuchullin answered in his turn. \" Good, 0 Cuchullin, what untoward fate Has brought thee here to measure swords with me ? For when we two with Scatha lived, in Skye, With Uatha, and with Aife, thou wert then My page to spread my couch for me at night, Or tie my spears together for the chase.\" \" True hast thou spoken,\" said Cuchullin; \"yes, I then was young, thy junior, and I did For thee the services thou dost recall ; A different story shall be told of us From this day forth, for on this day I feel Earth holds no champion that I dare not fight ! \" And thus invectives bitter, sharp and cold, Between the two were uttered, and first spake Ferdiah, then alternate each with each. Ferdiah. What has brought thee here, 0 Hound, To encounter a strong foe ? O'er the trappings of thy steeds Crimson-red thy blood shall flow. Woe is in thy journey, woe ; Let the cunning leech prepare ; Shouldst thou ever reach thy home, Thou shalt need his care."], [85, "FERDIAH. 57 Cuchullin. I, who here with warriors fought, With the lordly chiefs of hosts, With a hundred men at once, Little heed thy empty boasts. Thee beneath the wave to place, Thee to strike and thee to slay In the first path of our fight Am I here to-day. Ferdiah. Thy reproach in me behold, For 'tis I that deed will do, 'Tis of me that Fame shall tell He the Ultonian's champion slew. Yes, in spite of all their hosts, Yes, in spite of all their prayers : So it shall long be told That the loss was theirs. Cuchullin. How, then, shall we first engage \u2014 Is it with the hard-edged sword ? In what order shall we go To the battle of the Ford ? Shall we in our chariots ride ? Shall we wield the bloody spear ? How am I to hew thee down With thy proud hosts here ? Ferdiah. Ere the setting of the sun, Ere shall come the darksome night, If again thou must be told, With a mountain thou shalt fight : Thee the Ultonians will extol, Thence impetuous wilt thou grow, Oh ! their grief, when through their ranks Will thy spectre go !"], [86, "58 FERDIAH. Cuchullin. Thou hast fallen in danger's gap, Yes, thy end of life is nigh ; Sharp spears shall be plied on thee Fairly 'neath the open sky : Pompous thou wilt be and vain Till the time for talk is o'er, From this day a battle-chief Thou shalt be no more. Ferdiah. Cease thy boastings, for the world Sure no braggart hath like thee : Thou art not the chosen chief \u2014 Thou hast not the champion's fee Without action, without force, Thou art but a giggling page ; Yes, thou trembler, with thy heart Like a bird's in cage. Cuchullin. When we were with Scatha once, It but seemed our valour's due That we should together fight, Both as one our sports pursue. Thou wert then my dearest friend, Comrade, kinsman, thou wert all, Ah, how sad, if by my hand Thou at last should fall. Ferdiah. Much of honour shalt thou lose, We may then mere words forego : \u2014 On a stake thy head shall be Ere the early cock shall crow. 0 Cuchullin, Cuailgne's pride, Grief and madness round thee twine I will do thee every ill, For the fault is thine."], [87, "59 ferdiah. \" Good, 0 Ferdiah, 'twas no knightly act,\" Cuchullin said, \" to have come meanly here, To combat and to fight with an old friend, Through instigation of the wily Mave, Through intermeddling of Ailill the king ; To none of those who here before thee came Was victory given, for they all fell by me : \u2014 Thou too shalt win nor victory, nor increase Of fame in this encounter thou dost dare, For as they fell, so thou by me shall fall.\" Thus was he saying and he spake these words. To which Ferdiah listened, not unmoved. Cuchullin. Come not to me, 0 champion of the host, Come not to me, Ferdiah, as my foe, For though it is thy fate to suffer most, All, all must feel the universal woe. Come not to me defying what is right, Come not to me, thy life is in my power ; Ah, the dread issue of each former fight Why hast thou not remembered ere this hour ? Art thou not bright with diverse dainty arms, A purple girdle and a coat of mail ? And yet to win the maid of peerless charms For whom thou dar'st the battle thou shalt fail. Yes, Finavair, the daughter of the queen, The faultless form, the gold without alloy, The glorious virgin of majestic mien, Shalt not be thine, Ferdiah, to enjoy. No, the great prize shall not by thee be won, \u2014 A fatal lure, a false, false light is she, To numbers promised and yet given to none, And wounding many as she now wounds thee."], [88, "60 ferdiah. Break not thy vow, never with me to fight, Break not the bond that once thy young heart gave, Break not the truth we both so loved to plight, Come not to me, 0 champion bold and brave ! To fifty champions by her smiles made slaves The maid was proffered, and not slight the gift ; By me they have been sent into their graves, From me they met destruction sure and swift. Though vauntingly Ferbaeth my arms defied, He of a house of heroes prince and peer, Short was the time until I tamed his pride With one swift cast of my true battle-spear. Srub Daire's valour too had swift decline : Hundreds of women's secrets he possessed, Great at one time was his renown as thine, In cloth of gold, not silver, was he dressed. Though 'twas to me the woman was betrothed On whom the chiefs of the fair province smile, To shed thy blood my spirit would have loathed East, west, or north, or south of all the isle. \" Good, 0 Ferdiah,\" still continuing, spoke Cuchullin, \" thus it is that thou shouldst not Have come with me to combat and to fight ; For when we were with Scatha, long ago, With Uatha and with Aife, we were wont To go together to each battle-field, To every combat and to every fight, Through every forest, every wilderness, Through every darksome path and dangerous way.\" And thus he said and thus he spake these words :"], [89, "FERDIAH. 61 Cuchullin. We were heart-comrades then, \u2014 Comrades in crowds of men, In the same bed have lain, When slumber sought us ; In countries far and near, Hurling the battle spear, Chasing the forest deer, As Scatha taught us. \" 0 Cuchullin of the beautiful feats,\" Replied Ferdiah, \" though we have pursued ogether thus the arts of war and peace, And though the bonds of friendship that we swore Thou hast recalled to mind, from me shall come Thy first of wounds. O Hound, remember not Our old companionship, which shall not now Avail thee, shall avail thee not, 0 Hound !\" \" Too long here have we waited in this way,\" Again resumed Ferdiah. \" To what arms, Say then, Cuchullin, shall we now resort ? \" \" The choice of arms is thine until the night,\" Cuchullin made reply; \" for so it chanced That thou shouldst be the first to reach the Ford.\" \"Dost thou at all remember,\" then rejoined Ferdiah, \" those swift missive spears with which We practised oft with Scatha in our youth, With Uatha and with Aife, and our friends ?\" \" Them I, indeed, remember well,\" replied Cuchullin. \" If thou dost remember well, Let us to them resort,'' Ferdiah said. Their missive weapons then on either side They both resorted to. Upon their arms They braced two emblematic missive shields, And their eight well-turned-handled lances took, Their eight quill-javelins also, and their eight White ivory-hilted swords, and their eight spears, Sharp, ivory-hasted, with hard points of steel."], [90, "62 FERDIAH. Betwixt the twain the darts went to and fro, Like bees upon the wing on a fine day ; No cast was made that was not sure to hit. From morn to nigh mid-day the missiles flew, Till on the bosses of the brazen shields Their points were blunted, but though true the aim, And excellent the shooting, the defence Was so complete that not a wound was given, And neither champion drew the other's blood. \" 'Tis time to drop these feats,\" Ferdiah said, \" For not by such as these shall we decide Our battle here this day.\" \" Let us desist,\" Cuchullin answered, \" if the time hath come.\" They ceased, and threw their missile shafts aside Into the hands of their two charioteers. \" What weapons, 0 Cuchullin, shall we now Resort to ?\" said Ferdiah. \" Unto thee,\" Cuchullin answered, \" doth belong the choice Of arms until the night, because thou wert The first that reached the Ford.\" \"Well, let us, then,\" Ferdiah said, \" resume our straight, smooth, hard, Well-polished spears with their hard flaxen strings.'' \"Let us resume them, then,\" Cuchullin said. They braced upon their arms two stouter shields, And then resorted to their straight, smooth, hard, Well-polished spears, with their hard flaxen strings.* 'Twas now mid-day, and thus 'till eventide They shot against each other with the spears. But though the guard was good on either side, The shooting was so perfect that the blood Ran from the wounds of each, by each made red. \" Let us now, O Cuchullin,\" interposed Ferdiah, \" for the present time desist.\" \" Let us indeed desist,\" Cuchullin said * \" Derg Dian Scothach saw this order, and he put his fore finger into the string of the spear.\" \" Fate of the children of Tuireann,\" by O'Curry, Atlantis iv., p. 233. See also \" Battle of Magh Rath,\" pp, 140, 141, 152."], [91, "FERDIAH. 63 \" If, 0 Ferdiah, the fit time hath come.\" They ceased, and laid their gory weapons down, Their faithful charioteers' attendant care. Each to the other gently then approached, Each round the other's neck his hands entwined, And gave him three fond kisses on the cheek. Their horses fed in the same field that night, Their charioteers were warmed at the same fire, Their charioteers beneath their bodies spread Green rushes, and beneath the heads the down Of wounded men's soft pillows. Then the skilled Professors of the art of healing came With herbs, which to the scars of all their wounds They put. Of every herb and healing plant That to Cuchullin's wound they did apply, He would an equal portion westward send Over the Ford, Ferdiah' s wounds to heal. So that the men of Erin could not say, If it should chance Ferdiah fell by him, That it was through superior skill and care Cuchullin was enabled him to slay. Of each kind, too, of palatable food And sweet, intoxicating, pleasant drink, The men of Erin to Ferdiah sent, He a fair moiety across the Ford Sent northward to Cuchullin, where he lay ; Because his own purveyors far surpassed In numbers those the Ulster chief retained : For all the federate hosts of Erin were Purveyors to Ferdiah, with the hope That he would beat Cuchullin from the Ford. The Bregians* only were Cuchullin's friends, His sole purveyors, and their wont it was To come to him and talk to him at night. That night they rested there. Next morn they rose And to the Ford of battle early came. * Bregia Was the ancient name of the plain watered by the Boyne."], [92, "64 FERDIAH. \" What weapons shall we use to-day ?\" inquired Cuchullin. \" Until night the choice is thine,\" Replied Ferdiah ; \" for the choice of arms Has hitherto been mine.\" \" Then let us take Our great broad spears to-day,\" Cuchullin said, \" And may the thrusting bring us to an end Sooner than yesterday's less powerful darts. Let then our charioteers our horses yoke Beneath our chariots, so that we to-day May from our horses and our chariots fight.\" Ferdiah answered : \" Let it so be done.\" And then they braced their two broad, f ull-firm shields Upon their arms that day, and in their hands That day they took their great broad-bladed spears. And thus from early morn to evening's close They 'smote each other with such dread effect That both were pierced, and both made red with gore,\u2014 Such wounds, such hideous clefts in either breast Lay open to the back, that if the birds Cared ever through men's wounded frames to pass, They might have passed that day, and with them borne Pieces of quivering flesh into the air. When evening came, their very steeds were tired, Their charioteers depressed, and they themselves Worn out \u2014 even they the champions bold and brave \" Let us from this, Ferdiah, now desist,\" Cuchullin said ; \" for see, our charioteers Droop, and our very horses flag and fail, And when fatigued they yield, so well may we.\" And further thus he spoke, persuading rest : \u2014 Cuchullin Not with the obstinate rage and spite With which Fomorian pirates fight Let us, since now has fallen the night, Continue thus our feud ;"], [93, "65 FERDIAH. In brief abeyance it may rest, Now that a calm comes o'er each breast : \u2014 When with new light the world is blest, Be it again renewed.\" \" Let us desist, indeed,\" Ferdiah said, \" If the fit time hath come.\" \u2014 And so they ceased. From them they threw their arms into the hands Of their two charioteers. Each of them came Forward to meet the other. Each his hands Put round the other's neck, and thus embraced, Gave to him three fond kisses on the cheek. Their horses fed in the same field that night ; Their charioteers were warmed by the same fire. Their charioteers beneath their bodies spread Green rushes, and beneath their heads the down Of wounded men's soft pillows. Then the skilled Professors of the art of healing came To tend them and to cure them through the night. But they for all their skill could do no more, So numerous and so dangerous were the wounds, The cuts, and clefts, and scars so large and deep, But to apply to them the potent charms Of witchcraft, incantations, and barb spells, As sorcerers use, to stanch the blood and stay The life that else would through the wounds es- cape : \u2014 Of every charm of witchcraft, every spell, Of every incantation that was used To heal Cuchullin's wounds, a full fair half Over the Ford was westward sent to heal Ferdiah 's hurts : of every sort of food, And sweet, intoxicating, pleasant drink The men of Erin to Ferdiah sent, He a fair moiety across the Ford Sent northward to Cuchullin where he lay, Because his own purveyors far surpassed In number those the Ulster chief retained. For all the federate hosts of Erin were Purveyors to Ferdiah, with the hope 6"], [94, "66 FERDIAH. That he would beat Cuchullin from the Ford. The Bregians only were Cuchullin's friends \u2014 His sole purveyors \u2014 and their wont it was To come to him, and talk with him at night. They rested there that night. Next morn they rose, And to the Ford of battle forward came. That day a great, ill-favoured, lowering cloud Upon Ferdiah's face Cuchullin saw. \" Badly,\" said he, \" dost thou appear this day, Ferdiah, for thy hah- has duskier grown This day, and a dull stupour dims thine eyes, And thine own face and form, and what thou wert In outward seeming have deserted thee.\" \" 'Tis not through fear of thee that I am so,\" Ferdiah said, \" for Erin doth not hold This day a champion I could not subdue.\" And thus betwixt the twain this speech arose, And thus Cuchullin mourned and he replied : Cuchullin. 0 Ferdiah, if it be thou, Certain am I that on thy brow The blush should burn and the shame should rise, Degraded man whom the gods despise, Here at a woman's bidding to wend To fight thy fellow-pupil and friend. Ferdiah. 0 Cuchullin, 0 valiant man, Inflicter of wounds since the war began, O true champion, a man must come To the fated spot of his final home, \u2014 To the sod predestined by fate's decree His resting-place and his grave to be. Cuchullin. Finavair, the daughter of Mave, Although thou art her willing slave,"], [95, "67 FERDIAH. Not for thy long-felt love has been Promised to thee by the wily queen, \u2014 No, it was but to test thy might That thou wert lured into this fatal fight. Ferdiah. My might was tested long ago In many a battle, as thou dost know, Long, 0 Hound of the gentle rule, Since we fought together in Scatha's school : Never a braver man have I seen, Never, I feel, hath a braver been. Cuchullin. Thou art the cause of what has been done, O son of D\u00a3man, Dare's son, Of all that has happened thou art the cause, Whom hither a woman's counsel draws \u2014 Whom hither a wily woman doth send To measure swords with thy earliest friend. Ferdiah. If I forsook the field, 0 Hound, If I had turned from the battleground \u2014 This battleground without fight with thee, Hard, oh, hard had it gone with me ; Bad should my name and fame have been With King Ailill and with Mave the queen. Cuchullin. Though Mave of Croghan had given me food, Even from her lips, though all of good That the heart can wish or wealth can give Were offered to me, there does not live A king or queen on the earth for whom I would do thee ill or provoke thy doom. Ferdiah. 0 Cuchullin, thou victor in fight, Of battle triumphs the foremost knight ;"], [96, "68 FERDIAH. To what result the fight may lead, 'Twas Mave alone that prompted the deed ; Not thine the fault, not thine the blame, Take thou the victory and the fame. Cuchullin. My faithful heart is a clot of blood, A feud thus forced cannot end in good ; Oh, woe to him who is here to be slain ! Oh, grief to him who his life will gain ! For feats of valour no strength have I To fight the fight where my friend must die. \" A truce to these invectives,\" then broke in Ferdiah ; \"we far other work this day Have yet to do than rail with woman's words. Say, what shall be our arms in this day's fight ?\" \"Till night,\" Cuchullin said, \" the choice is thine, For yester morn the choice was given to me.\" \" Let us,\" Ferdiah answered, \" then resort Unto our heavy, sharp, hard- smiting swords, For we are nearer to the end to-day Of this our fight, by hewing, than we were On yesterday by thrusting of the spears.\" \" So let us do, indeed,\" Cuchullin said. Then on their arms two long great shields they took. And in their hands their sharp, hard-smiting swords, Each hewed the other with such furious strokes That pieces larger than an infant's head Of four weeks' old were cut from out the thighs And great broad shoulder-blades of each brave chief, And thus they persevered from early morn Till evening's close in hewing with the swords. \" Let us desist,\" at length Ferdiah said. \" Let us indeed desist, if the fit time Hath come,\" Cuchullin said ; and so they ceased. From them they cast their arms into the hands Of their two charioteers ; and though that morn Their meeting was of two high-spirited men, Their separation, now that night had come,"], [97, "FERDIAH. 69 Was of two men dispirited and sad. Their horses were not in one field that night, Their charioteers were warmed not at one fire. That night they rested there, and in the morn Ferdiah early rose and sought alone The Ford of battle, for he knew that day Would end the fight, and that the hour drew nigh When one or both of them should surely fall. Then was it for the first time he put on His battle suit of battle and of fight, Before Cuchullin came unto the Ford. That battle suit of battle and of fight Was this : His apron of white silk, with fringe Of spangled gold around it, he put on Next his white skin. A leather apron then, Well sewn, upon his body's lower part He placed, and over it a mighty stone As large as any mill- stone was secured. His firm, deep, iron apron then he braced Over the mighty stone \u2014 an apron made Of iron purified from every dross \u2014 Such dread had he that day of the Gaebulg. His crested helm of battle on his head He last put on \u2014 a helmet all ablaze From forty gems in each compartment set, Cruan, and crystal, carbuncles of fire, And brilliant rubies of the Eastern world. In his right hand a mighty spear he seized, Destructive, sharply-pointed, straight and strong On his left side his sword of battle swung, Curved, with its hilt and pommel of red gold. Upon the slope of his broad back he placed His dazzling shield, around whose margin rose Fifty huge bosses, each of such a size That on it might a full-grown hog recline, Exclusive of the larger central boss That raised its prominent round of pure red gold. Full many noble, varied, wondrous feats Ferdiah on that day displayed, which he"], [98, "70 FERDIAH. Had never learned at any tutor's hand, From Uatha, or from Aife, or from her, Scatha, his early nurse in lonely Skye : \u2014 But which were all invented by himself That day, to bring about Cuchullin's fall. Cuchullin to the Ford approached and saw The many noble, varied, wondrous feats Ferdiah on that day displayed on high. \" 0 Laegh, my friend,\" Cuchullin thus addressed His charioteer, \" I see the wondrous feats Ferdiah doth display on high to-day : All these on me in turn shall soon be tried, And therefore note, that if it so should chance I shall be first to yield, be sure to taunt, Excite, revile me, and reproach me so, That wrath and rage in me may rise the more : \u2014 If I prevail, then let thy words be praise, Laud me, congratulate me, do thy best To stimulate my courage to its height.\" \" It shall be done, Cuchullin,\" Laegh replied. Then was it that Cuchullin first assumed His battle suit of battle : then he tried Full many, various, noble, wondrous feats He never learned from any tutor's hands, From Uatha, or from Aife, or from her, Scatha, his early nurse in lonely Skye. Ferdiah saw these various feats, and knew Against himself they soon would be applied. \" Say, 0 Ferdiah, to what arms shall we Resort in this day's fight ?\" Cuchullin said. Ferdiah answered, \"Unto thee belongs The choice of weapons now until the night.\" \" Let us then try the Ford Feat on this day,\" Replied Cuchullin. \" Let us then, indeed,\" Rejoined Ferdiah, with a careless air Consenting, though in truth it was to him The cause of grief to say so, since he knew"], [99, "71 FERDIAn. That in the Ford Feat lay Cuchullin's strength, And that he never failed to overthrow Champion or hero in that last appeal. Great was the feat that was performed that day In and beside the Ford : the mighty two, The two great heroes, warriors, champions, chiefs Of western Europe \u2014 the two open hands Laden with gifts of the north-western world, \u2014 The two beloved pillars that upheld The valour of the Gaels \u2014 the two strong keys That kept the bravery of the Gaels secure \u2014 Thus to be brought together from afar To fight each other through the meddling schemes Of Ailill and his wily partner Mave. From each to each the missive weapons flew From dawn of early morning to mid- day ; And when mid-day had come, the ire of both Became more furious, and they drew more near. Then was it that Cuchullin made a spring From the Ford's brink, and came upon the boss Of the great shield Ferdiah's arm upheld, That thus he might, above the broad shield's rim, Strike at his head. Ferdiah with a touch Of his left elbow, gave the shield a shake And cast Cuchullin from him like a bird, Back to the brink of the Ford. Again he sprang From the Ford's brink, and came upon the boss Of the great shield once more, to strike his head Over the rim. Ferdiah with a stroke Of his left knee made the great shield to ring, And cast Cuchullin back upon the brink, As if he only were a little child. Laegh saw the act. \"Alas! indeed,\" said Laegh, \" The warrior casts thee from him in the way That an abandoned woman would her child. He flings thee as a river flings its foam ; He grinds thee as a mill would grind fresh malt ; He fells thee as the axe does fell the oak ; He binds thee as the woodbine binds the tree ;"], [100, "72 FERDIAH. He darts upon thee as a hawk doth dart Upon small birds, so that from this hour forth Until the end of time, thou hast no claim Or title to be called a valorous man : Thou little puny phantom form,\" said Laegh. Then with the rapid motion of the wind, The fleetness of a swallow on the wing, The fierceness of a dragon, and the strength Of a roused lion, once again up sprang Cuchullin, high into the troubled air, And lighted for the third time on the boss Of the broad shield, to strike Ferdiah's head Over the rim. The warrior shook the shield, And cast Cuchullin mid-way in the Ford, With such an easy effort that it seemed As if he scarcely deigned to shake him off. Then, as he lay, a strange distortion came Upon Cuchullin ; as a bladder swells Inflated by the breath, to such a size And fulness did he grow, that he became A fearful, many- coloured, wondrous Tuaig \u2014 Gigantic shape, as big as a man of the sea, Or monstrous Fomor, so that now his form In perfect height oyer Ferdiah stood. So close the fight was now, that their heads met Above, their feet below, their arms half-way Over the rims and bosses of their shields : \u2014 So close the fight was now, that from their rims Unto their centres were their shields cut through, And loosed was every rivet from its hold ; So close the fight was now, that their strong spears Were turned and bent and shivered point and haft; Such was the closeness of the fight they made That the invisible and unearthly hosts Of Spirits, Bocanachs and Bananachs, And the wild wizard people of the gle"], [101, "73 FERDIAH. And of the air the demons, shrieked and screamed From their broad shields' reverberating rim, From their sword-hilts and their long-shafted spears : Such was the closeness of the fight they made, They forced the river from its natural course, Out of its bed, so that it might have been A couch whereon a king or queen might lie, For not a drop of water it retained, Except what came from the great tramp and splash Of the two heroes fighting in its midst. Such was the fierceness of the fight they waged, That a wild fury seized upon the steeds The Gaels had gathered with them ; in affright They burst their traces and their binding ropes, Nay even their chains, and panting fled away. The women, too, and youths, by equal fears Inspired and scared, and all the varied crowd Of followers and non-combatants who there Were with the men of Erin, from the camp South-westward broke away, and fled the Ford. At the edge-feat of swords they were engaged When this surprise occurred, and it was then Ferdiah an unguarded moment found Upon Cuchullin, and he struck him deep, Plunging his straight-edged sword up to the hilt Within his body, till his girdle filled With blood, and all the Ford ran red with gore From the brave battle-warrior's veins outshed. This could Cuchullin now no longer bear Because Ferdiah still the unguarded spot Struck and re-struck with quick, strong, stubborn strokes ; And so he called aloud to Laegh, the son Of Riangabra, for the dread Gaebulg. The manner of that fearful feat was this : Adown the current was it sent, and caught Between the toes : a single spear would make The wound it made when entering, but once lodged Within the body, thirty barbs outsprung,"], [102, "74 FERDIAH. So that it could not be withdrawn until The body was cut open where it lay. And when of the Gaebulg Ferdiah heard The name, he made a downward stroke of his shield, To guard his body. Then Cuchullin thrust The unerring thorny spear straight o'er the rim, And through the breast-plate of his coat of mail, So that its farther half was seen beyond His body, after passing through his heart. Ferdiah gave an upward stroke of his shield, His breast to cover, though it was \" the relief After the danger.\" Then the servant set The dread Gaebulg adown the flowing stream ; Cuchullin caught it firmly 'twixt his toes, And from his foot a fearful cast he threw Upon Ferdiah with unerring aim. Swift through the well-wrought hon apron guard It passed, and through the stone which was as large As a huge mill- stone, cracking it in three, And so into his body, every part Of which was filled with the expanding barbs. \" That is enough : by that one blow I fall,\" Ferdiah said. \" Indeed, I now may own That I am sickly after thee this day, Though it behoved not thee that I should fall By stroke of thine ;\" aud then these dying words He added, tottering back upon the bank : Ferdiah. 0 Hound, so famed for deeds of valour doing, 'Twas not thy place my death to give to me ; Thine is the fault of my most certain ruin, And yet 'tis best to have my blood on thee. The wretch escapes not from his false position, Who to the gap of his destruction goes ; Alas ! my deatb-sick voice needs no physician, My end hath come \u2014 my life's stream seaward flows"], [103, "FERDIAH. 75 The natural ramparts of my breast are broken, In its own gore my struggling heart is drowned Alas ! I have not fought as I have spoken, For thou hast killed me in the fight, 0 Hound ! Cuchullin towards him ran, and his two arms Clasping about him, lifted him and bore The body in its armour and its clothes Across the Ford unto the northern bank, In order that the slain should thus be placed Upon the north bank of the Ford, and not Among the men of Erin, on the west. Cuchullin laid Ferdiah down, and then A sudden trance, a faintness on him came When bending o'er the body of his friend. Laegh saw the weakness, which was seen as well By all the men of Erin, who arose Upon the moment to attack him there. \" Good, O Cuchullin,\" Laegh exclaimed, \" arise, For all the men of Erin hither come. It is no single combat they will give, Since fair Ferdiah, Daman's son, the son Of Dare, by thy hands has here been slain.\" \" O servant, what availeth me to rise,\" Cuchullin said, \" since he hath fallen by me ?\" And so the servant said, and so rephed Cuchullin, in his turn, unto the end ; Laegh. Arise, Emania's slaughter-hound, arise, Exultant pride should be thy mood this day : Ferdiah of the hosts before thee lies \u2014 Hard was the fight and dreadful was the fray. Cuchullin.

In body- cutting combat, on the field Of spears, when all is lost or all is won, None braver ever yet held up a shield, Than thou, Ferdiah, Daman's ruddy son.

When we were young, where Scatha's eye hath seen us Fond fellow-pupils in her schools of Skye, Never was heard the angry word between us, Never was seen the angry spear to fly.

I and Ferdiah were the first to enter, Where he himself, the dread Germoin, held rule, Rind, Nial's son, I clove from head to centre, Ruad I killed, the son of Finniule. First on the shore, as swift our fleet ships flew there. Bl\u00a3th, son of Calba of red swords, was slain ; Struck by Ferdiah, Luaigh also slew there Fierce rude Mugarne of the Torrian main.

[We are informed that Brendan, hearing of the previous voy age of his cousin, Barinthus, in the western ocean, and obtain ing an account from him of the happy isles he had landed on in the far west, determined, under the strong desire of winning heathen souls to Christ, to undertake a voyage of discovery himself. And aware that all along the western coast of Ireland there were many traditions respecting the existence of a western land, he proceeded to the islands of Arran, and there remained for some time, holding communication with the venerable St. Enda, and obtaining from him much information relating to his voyage. Having prosecuted his inquiries with diligence, Brendan returned to his native Kerry ; and from a bay sheltered by the lofty mountain that is now known by his name, he set sail for the Atlantic land ; and, directing his course towards the south-west, in order to meet the summer solstice, or what we should call the tropic, after a long and rough voyage, his little bark being well provisioned, he came to summer seas, where he was carried along, without the aid of sail or oar, for many a long day. This, which it is to be presumed was the great gulf-stream, brought his vessel to shore somewhere about the Virginian capes, or where the American coast tends eastward, aud forms the New England States. Here landing, he and his companions marched steadily into the interior for fifteen days, and then came to a large river, flowing from east to west : this, evidently, was the river Ohio. And this the holy adventurer was about to cross, when he was accosted by a person of noble presence \u2014 but whether a real or visionary man does not appear \u2014 who told him he had gone far enough ; that further discoveries were reserved for other men, who would, in due time, come and Christianise all that pleasant land It is said he remained seven years away, and returned to set up a college of three thousand monks, at Clonfert. \u2014 C\u00e6sar Ohoay's Sketches in Erris and Tijraideij, note, pp. 98, 99.] The Vocation.

Thou knowest, O my mother ! how to thee The blessed Ercus led me when a boy, And how within thine arms and at thine knee, I learned the lore that death cannot destroy ; And how I parted hence with bitter tears, And felt, when turning from thy friendly door, In the reality of ripening years, My paradise of childhood was no more. I wept \u2014 but not with sin such tear-drops flow ; \u2014 I sighed \u2014 for earthly things with heaven entwine ; Tears make the harvest of the heart to grow, And love though human is almost divine.

And thus, where'er I went, all things to me Assumed the one deep colour of my mind ; Great nature's prayer rose from the murmuring sea, And sinful man sighed in the wintry wind. The thick-veiled clouds by shedding many a tear, Like penitents, grew purified and bright, And, bravely struggling through earth's atmosphere, Passed to the regions of eternal light. I loved to watch the clouds now dark and dun, In long procession and funereal fine, Pass with slow pace across the glorious sun, Like hooded monks before a dazzling shrine. And now with gentler beauty as they rolled Along the azure vault in gladsome May, Gleaming pure white, and edged with broidered gold, Like snowy vestments on the Virgin's day. And then I saw the mighty sea expand Like Time's unmeasured and unfathomed waves, One with its tide-marks on the ridgy sand, The other with its hne of weedy graves ; And as beyond the outstretched wave of time, The eye of Faith a brighter land may meet, So did I dream of some more sunny clime Beyond the waste of waters at my feet. Some clime where man, unknowing and unknown, For God's refreshing word still gasps and faints ; Or happier rather some Elysian zone, Made for the habitation of his saints :"], [114, "86 THE VOYAGE OF ST. BRENDAN. Where Nature's love the sweat of labour spares, Nor turns to usury the wealth it lends, Where the rich soil spontaneous harvest bears, And the tall tree with milk-filled clusters bends. The thought grew stronger with my growing days, Even like to manhood's strengthening mind and limb, And often now amid the purple haze That evening breathed upon the horizon's rim \u2014 Methought, as there I sought my wished-for home, I could descry amid the waters green, Full many a diamond shrine and golden dome, And crystal palaces of dazzling sheen. And then I longed, with impotent desire, Even for the bow whereby the Python bled, That I might send one dart of living fire Into that land, before the vision fled, And thus at length fix thy enchanted shore, Hy-Brasail, Eden of the western wave ! That thou again wouldst fade away no more, Buried and lost within thy azure grave. But angels came and whispered as I dreamt, \" This is no phantom of a frenzied brain \u2014 God shows this land from time to time to tempt Some daring mariner across the main : By thee the mighty venture must be made, By thee shall myriad souls to Christ be won !

Betwixt the Samphire Isles swam my light skiff, And like an arrow flew through Fenor Sound, Swept by the pleasant strand, and the tall cliff, Whereon the pale rose amethysts are found. Rounded Moyferta's rocky point, and crossed The mouth of stream-streaked Erin's mightiest tide, Whose troubled waves break o'er the City lost, Chafed by the marble turrets that they hide. Beneath Ibrickan's hills, moory and tame, And Inniscaorach's caves, so wild and dark, I sailed along. The white-faced otter came, And gazed in wonder on my floating bark. The soaring gannet, perched upon my mast, And the proud bird, that flies but o'er the sea, Wheeled o'er my head : and the girrinna passed Upon the branch of some life-giving tree. J Leaving the awful cliffs of Corcomroe, I sought the rocky eastern isle, that bears The name of blessed Coemhan, who doth show Pity unto the storm-tossed seaman's prayers ; Then crossing Bealach-na-fearbach's treacherous sound, I reached the middle isle, whose citadel Looks like a monarch from its throne around ; And there I rested by St. Kennerg's well. * The Atlantic was so named by the ancient Irish. t Ardfert.

Again I sailed, and crossed the stormy sound That lies beneath Binn-Aite's rocky height \u2014 And there, upon the shore, the Saint I found Waiting my coming through the tardy night. He led me to his home beside the wave, Where, with his monks, the pious father dwelled, And to my listening ear he freely gave The sacred knowledge that his bosom held. When I proclaimed the project that I nursed, How 'twas for this that I his blessing sought, An irrepressible cry of joy outburst From his pure hps, that blessed me for the thought, He said that he, too, had in visions strayed Over the untracked ocean's billowy foam; Bid me have hope, that God would give me aid, And bring me safe back to my native home.

How he himself came hither with his flock, To teach the infidels from Corcomroe, Upon the floating breast of the hard rock, Which lay upon the glistening sands below.

At length I tore me from the good man's sight, And o'er Loch Lurgan's mouth* took my lone way, Which, in the sunny morning's golden light, Shone like the burning lake of Lassar\u00e6 ; Now 'neath heaven's frown \u2014 and now, beneath its smile \u2014 Borne on the tide, or driven before the gale ; And, as I passed Mac Dara's sacred Isle, Thrice bowed my mast, and thrice let down my sail. Westward of Arran as I sailed away ; I saw the fairest sight eye can behold \u2014 Rocks which, illumined by the morning's ray, Seemed like a glorious city built of gold. Men moved along each sunny shining street, Fires seemed to blaze, and curling smoke to rise, When lo ! the city vanished, and a fleet, With snowy sails, rose on my ravished eyes. Thus having sought for knowledge and for strength, For the unheard-of voyage that I planned, I left these myriad isles, and turned at length Southward my bark, and sought my native land. There made I all things ready, day by day, The wicker-boat, with ox-skins covered o'er \u2014 Chose the good monks companions of my way, And waited for the wind to leave the shore. The Voyage.

Over the sea we flew that sunny morn, ' Not without natural tears and human sighs : For who can leave the land where he was born, And where, perchance, a buried mother lies ; Where all the friends of riper manhood dwell, And where the playmates of his childhood sleep : Who can depart, and breathe a cold farewell, Nor let his eyes their honest tribute weep ? Our little bark, kissing the dimpled smiles On ocean's cheek, flew like a wanton bird, And then the land, with all its hundred isles, Faded away, and yet we spoke no word. Each silent tongue held converse with the past, Each moistened eye looked round the circling wave, And, save the spot where stood our trembling mast, Saw all things hid within one mighty grave.

She long has passed out of Time's aching womb, And breathes Eternity's favonian air ; Yet fond Tradition lingers o'er her tomb, And paints her glorious features as they were : \u2014 * These stanzas are a paraphrase of the hymn \" Ave Maria Stella,\""], [121, "THE VOYAGE OF ST. BRENDAN. 93 Her smile was Eden's pure and stainless light, Which never cloud nor earthly vapour mars \u2022 Her lustrous eyes were like the noon of night Black, but yet brightened by a thousand stars ; Her tender form, moulded in modest grace, Shrank from the gazer's eye, and moved apart ; Heaven shone reflected in her angel face, And God reposed within her virgin heart. She dwelt in green Moyarta's pleasant land, Beneath the graceful hills of Clonderlaw, \u2014 Sweet sunny hills, whose triple summits stand, One vast tiara over stream and shaw. Almost in sohtude the maiden grew, And reached her early budding woman's prime ; And all so noiselessly the swift time flew, She knew not of the name or flight of Time. And thus, within her modest mountain nest, This gentle maiden nestled like a dove, Offering to God from her pure innocent breast The sweet and silent incense of her love; No selfisfi feeling nor presumptuous pride In her calm bosom waged unnatural strife ; Saint of her home and hearth, she sanctified The thousand trivial common cares of fife. Upon the opposite shore there dwelt a youth, Whose nature's woof was woven of good and ill \u2014 Whose stream of fife flowed to the sea of truth, But in a devious course, round many a hill \u2014 Now lingering through a valley of delight, Where sweet flowers bloomed, and summer song- birds sung, Now hurled along the dark, tempestuous night, With gloomy, treeless mountains overhung.

Full many a time he spread his little sail, How rough the river, or how dark the skies, Gave his light corrach to the angry gale, And crossed the stream to gaze on Ethna's eyes. As yet 'twas worship, more than human love, That hopeless adoration that we pay Unto some glorious planet throned above, Though severed from its crystal sphere for aye. But warmer love an easy conquest won, The more he came to green Moyarta's bowers ; Even as the earth, by gazing on the sun, In summer-time puts forth her myriad flowers. The yearnings of his heart \u2014 vague, undefined \u2014 Wakened and solaced by ideal gleams, Took everlasting shape, and intertwined Around this incarnation of his dreams. Some strange fatality restrained his tongue \u2014 He spoke not of the love that filled his breast ; The thread of hope, on which his whole life hung, Was far too weak to bear so strong a test. He trusted to the future \u2014 time, or chance \u2014 His constant homage and assiduous care ; Preferred to dream, and lengthen out his trance, Rather than wake to knowledge and despair. And thus she knew not, when the youth would look Upon some pictured chronicle of eld, In every blazoned letter of the book One fairest face was all that he beheld : And where the limner, with consummate art, Drew flowing lines and quaint devices rare, The wildered youth, by looking from the heart, Saw nought but lustrous eyes and waving hair."], [123, "THE VOYAGE OF ST.

He sought his boat, and snatched the feathery oar \u2014 It was the first and brightest morn of May : The white- winged clouds, that sought the northern shore, Seemed but Love's guides, to point him out the way. The great old river heaved its mighty heart, And, with a solemn sigh, went calmly on ; As if of all his griefs it felt a part, But knew they should be borne, and so had gone. Slowly his boat the languid breeze obeyed, Although the stream that that light burden bore Was like the level path the angels made, Through the rough sea, to Arran's blessed shore ; And from the rosy clouds the light airs fanned, And from the rich reflection that they gave, Like good Scothinus, had he reached his hand, He might have plucked a garland from the wave. And now the noon in purple splendour blazed, The gorgeous clouds in slow procession filed ; The youth leaned o'er with listless eyes and gazed Down through the waves on which the blue heavens smiled : What sudden fear his gasping breath doth drown ! What hidden wonder fires his startled eyes ! Down in tfie deep, full many a fathom down, A great and glorious city buried lies.

Beneath the graceful arch the river flowed, Around the walls the sparkling waters ran, The golden chariot rolled along the road \u2014 All, all was there except the face of man. The wondering youth had neither thought nor word, He felt alone the power and will to die ; His little bark seemed like an outstretched bird, Floating along that city's azure sky. It joyed that youth the battle's storm to brave, And yet he would have perished with affright, Had not the breeze, rippling tfie lucid wave, Concealed the buried city from his sight. He reached the shore ; the rumour was too true \u2014 Ethna \u2014 his Ethna \u2014 would be God's alone In one brief month ; for which the maid withdrew, To seek for strength before his blessed throne. Was it the fire that on his bosom preyed, Or the temptation of the Fiend abhorred, That made him vow to snatch the white- veiled maid Even from the very altar of her Lord ? The first of June, that festival of flowers, Came, like a goddess, o'er the meadows green ! And all the children of the spring-tide showers Rose from their grassy beds to hail their Queen.

She moved as moves the moon, radiant and pale, Through the calm night, wrapped in a silvery cloud ; The jewels of her dress shone through her veil, As shine the stars through their thin vaporous t shroud ; The brighter jewels of her eyes were hid Beneath their smooth white caskets arching o'er, Which, by the trembling of each ivory lid, Seemed conscious of the treasures that they bore.

Close to the place the stream rushed roaring by, His little boat lay moored beneath the bank, Hid from the shore, and from the gazer's eye, By waving reeds and water- willows dank. Hither, with flying feet, and glowing brow, He fled, as quick as fancies in a dream \u2014 Placed the insensate maiden in the prow \u2014 Pushed from the shore, and gained the open stream. Scarce had he left the river's foamy edge, When sudden darkness fell on hill and plain ; The angry sun, shocked at the sacrilege, Fled from the heavens with all his golden train ; The stream rushed quicker, like a man afeared ; Down swept the storm and clove its breast of green, And though the calm and brightness reappeared The youth and maiden never more were seen. Whether the current in its strong arms bore Their bark to green Hy-Brasail's fairy halls, Or whether, as is told along that shore, They sunk within the buried city's walls ; Whether through some Elysian clime they stray, Or o'er their whitened bones the river rolls ; \u2014 Whate'er their fate, my brothers, let us pray To God for peace and pardon to their souls."], [127, "THE VOYAGE OF ST.

He sent a messenger for the steed before that time, and was refused, although Cou had, at the same time, promised it to one of his own people. Con did not delay, and got over every difficult pass with his small-powerful force, without battle or obstruc tion, until he arrived in the night at the house of Mac John, whom he, in the first place, took prisoner, and his wife, steed, and hound, and all his property, were under Con's control, for he found the same steed, with sixteen others, in the town on that occasion. All the Glynnes were plundered on the follow ing day by Con's people, but he afterwards, however, made perfect restitution of all property, to whomsoever it belonged, to Mac John's wife, and he set her husband free to her after he had passed the Bann westward. He brought with him the steed and great booty and spoils, into Tirhugh, and ordered the cattle-prey to be let out on the pasturage. \u2014 Annals of the Four Masters, translated by Owen Connellan, Esq., p. 331-2.

And such was young Paolo ! The morning, ere yet the faint starlight had gone, To the loud-ringing workshop beheld him move joy- fully light-footed on. In the glare and the roar of the furnace he toiled till the evening star burned, And then back again through that valley, as glad but more weary returned. One moment at morning he fingers by that cottage that stands by the stream, Many moments at evening he tarries by that casement that woos the moon's beam ; For the fight of his life and his labours, like a lamp from that casement shines In the heart-lighted face that looks out from that purple-clad trellis of vines. Francesca ! sweet, innocent maiden ! 'tis not that thy young cheek is fair, Or thy sun- lighted eyes glance like stars through the curls of thy wind-woven hair ; 'Tis not for tfiy ricfi lips of coral, or even thy white breast of snow, That my song shall recall thee, Francesca ! but more for the good heart below."], [154, "126 THE BELL-FOUNDER.

One the long-sigh'd-f or nectar that earthliness bitterly tinctures and taints : One the fading mirage of the fancy, and one the elysium it paints. Long ago, when thy father would kiss thee, the tears in his old eyes would start, For thy face \u2014 hke a dream of his boyhood \u2014 renewed the fresh youth of his heart ; He is gone ; but thy mother remaineth, and kneeleth each night-time and morn, And blesses the Mother of Blessings for the hour her Francesca was born. There are proud stately dwellings in Florence, and mothers and maidens are there, And bright eyes as bright as Francesca's, and fair cheeks as brilliantly fair ; And hearts, too, as warm and as innocent, there where the rich paintings gleam, But what proud mother blesses her daughter like the mother by Arno's sweet stream ? It was not alone when that mother grew aged and feeble to hear, That thy voice like the whisper of angels still fell on the old woman's ear, Or even that thy face, when the darkness of time overshadowed her sight, Shone calm through the blank of her mind, like the moon in the midst of the night. But thine was the duty, Francesca, and the love- figfitened labour was thine, To treasure the white-curling wool and the warm- flowing milk of the kine, And the fruits, and the clusters of purple, and the flock's tender yearly increase, That she might have rest in life's evening, and go to her Father in peace."], [155, "127 THE BELL-FOUNDER. Francesca and Paolo are plighted, and they wait but a few happy days, Ere they walk forth together in trustfulness out on Life's wonderful ways ; Ere, clasping the hands of each other, they move through the stillness and noise, Dividing the cares of existence, but doubling its hopes and its joys. Sweet days of betrothment, which brighten so slowly to love's burning noon, Like the days of the spring which grow longer, the nearer the fulness of June, Though ye move to the noon and the summer of Love with a slow-moving wing, Ye are lit with, the light of the morning, and decked with the blossoms of spring. The days of betrothment are over, for now when the evening star shines, Two faces look joyfully out from that purple-clad trellis of vines ; The light-hearted laughter is doubled, two voices steal forth on the air, And blend in the light notes of song, or the sweet solemn cadence of prayer. At morning when Paolo departeth, 'tis out of that sweet cottage door, At evening he comes to that casement, but passes that casement no more ; And the old feeble mother at night-time, when saying, \" The Lord's will be done,\" While blessing the name of a daughter, now blendeth the name of a son.

In the furnace the dry branches crackle, the crucible shines as with gold, As they carry the hot flaming metal in haste from the fire to the mould ;"], [156, "128 THE BELL-FOUNDER. Loud roars the bellows, and louder the flames as they shrieking escape, And loud is the song of the workmen who watch o'er the fast-filling shape ; To and fro in the red-glaring chamber the proud master anxiously moves, And the quick and the skilful he praiseth, and the dull and the laggard reproves ; And the heart in his bosom expandeth, as the thick bubbling metal up swells, For like to the birth of his children he watcheth the birth of the bells. Peace had guarded the door of young Paolo, success on his industry smiled, And the dark wing of Time had passed quicker than grief from the face of a child ; Broader lands lay around that sweet cottage, younger footsteps tripped lightly around, And the sweet silent stillness was broken by the hum of a still sweeter sound. At evening when homeward returning how many dear hands must he press, Where of old at that vine-covered wicket he lingered but one to caress ; And that dearest one is still with him, to counsel, to strengthen, and calm, And to pour over Life's needful wounds the healing of Love's blessed balm. But age will come on with its winter, though happi- ness hideth its snows ; And if youth has its duty of labour, the birthright of age is repose : And thus from that love-sweetened toil, which the heavens had so prospered and blest, T^ite old Campanaro will go to that vine-covered cot- tage to rest ; But Paolo is pious and grateful, and vows as he kneels at her shrine, To offer some fruit of his labour to Mary the Mother benign \u2014"], [157, "THE BELL-FOUNDER. 129 Eight silver-toned bells will he offer, to toll for the quick and the dead, From the tower of the church of her convent that stands on the cliff overhead. 'Tis for this that the bellows are blowing, that the workmen their sledge-hammers wield, That the firm sandy moulds are now broken, and the dark- shining bells are revealed ; The cars with their streamers are ready, and the flower- harnessed necks of the steers, And the bells from their cold silent workshop are borne amid blessings and tears. By the white-blossom'd, sweet-scented myrtles, by the olive-trees fringing the plain, By the corn-fields and vineyards is winding that gift- bearing, festival train ; And the hum of their voices is blending with the music that streams on the gale, As they wend to the Church of our Lady that stands at the head of the vale. Now they enter, and now more divinely the saints' painted effigies smile, Now the acolytes bearing lit tapers move solemnly down through the aisle, Now the thurif er swings the rich censer, and the white curling vapour up-floats, And Aangs round the deep-pealing organ, and blends with the tremulous notes. In a white shining alb comes the abbot, and he circles the bells round about, And with oil, and with salt, and with watsr, they are purified inside and out ; They are marked with Christ's mystical symbol, while the priests and the choristers sing, And are bless'd in the name of that God to whose honour they ever shall ring. 10"], [158, "130 THE BELL-FOUNDER. Toll, toll ! with a rapid vibration, with a melody silv'ry and strong, The bells from the sound- shaken belfry are singing their first maiden song ; Not now for the dead or the living, or the triumphs of peace or of strife, But a quick joyous outburst of jubilee full of their newly-felt life ; Rapid, more rapid, the clapper rebounds from the round of the bells \u2014 Far and more far through the valley the intertwined melody swells \u2014 Quivering and broken the atmosphere trembles and twinkles around, Like the eyes and the hearts of the hearers that glisten and beat to the sound. But how to express all his rapture when echo the deep cadence bore To the old Campanaro reclining in the shade of his vine-covered door, How to tell of the bliss that came o'er him as he gazed on the fair evening star, And heard the faint toll of the vesper bell steal o'er the vale from afar \u2014 Ah ! it was not alone the brief ecstasy music doth ever impart When Sorrow and Joy at its bidding come together and dwell in the heart ; But it was that delicious sensation with which the young mother is blest, As she lists to the laugh of her child as it f alleth asleep on her breast. From a sweet night of slumber he woke ; but it was not that morn had unroll'd O'er the pale, cloudy tents of the Orient, her banners of purple and gold :"], [159, "131 THE BELL-FOUNDER. It was not the song of the skylark that rose from the green pastures near, But the sound of his bells that fell softly, as dew on the slumberer's ear. At that sound he awoke and arose, and went forth on the bead-bearing grass \u2014 \u25a0 At that sound, with his loving Francesca, he piously knelt at the Mass. If the sun shone in splendour around him, and that certain music were dumb, He would deem it a dream of the night-time, and doubt if the morning had come. At noon, as he lay in the sultriness, under his broad- leafy limes, Far sweeter than murmuring waters came the tone of the Angelus chimes. Pious and tranquil he rose, and uncovered his reverend head, And thrice was the Ave Maria and thrice was the Angelus said, Sweet custom the South still retaineth, to turn for a moment away From the pleasures and pains of existence, from the trouble and turmod of day, From the tumult within and without, to the peace that abideth on high, When the deep, solemn sound from the belfry comes down like a voice from the sky. And thus round the heart of the old man, at morning, at noon, and at eve, The bells, with their rich woof of music, the net-work of happiness weave, They ring in the clear, tranquil evening, and lo ! all the ah is alive, As the sweet-laden thoughts come, hke bees, to abide in his heart as a hive."], [160, "132 THE BELL-FOUNDER. They blend with his moments of joy, as the odour doth blend with the flower \u2014 They blend with his light-falling tears, as the sunshine doth blend with the shower. As their music is mirthful or mournful, his pulse beateth sluggish or fast, And his breast takes its hue, like the ocean, as the sunshine or shadows are cast. Thus adding new zest to enjoyment, and drawing the sharp sting from pain, The heart of the old man grew young, as it drank the sweet musical strain. Again at the altar he stands, with Francesca the fair at his side, As the bells ring a quick peal of gladness, to welcome some happy young bride. 'Tis true, when the death-bells are tolling, the wounds of his heart bleed anew, When he thinks of his old loving mother, and the darlings that destiny slew ; But the tower in whose shade they are sleeping seems the emblem of hope and of love, \u2014 There is silence and death at its base,but there's life in the belfry above. Was it the sound of his bells, as they swung in the purified ah, That drove from the bosom of Paolo the dark- winged demons of care ? Was it their magical tone that for many a shadowless day (So faith once believed) swept the clouds and the black-boding tempests away ? Ah ! never may Fate with their music a harsh- grating dissonance blend ! Sure an evening so calm and so bright will glide peacefully on to the end. Sure the course of his hfe, to its close, like his own native river must be, Flowing on through the valley of flowers to its home in the bright summer sea !"], [161, "THE BELL-FOUNDER. 133 VICISSITUDE AND REST. 0 Erin ! thou broad-spreading valley \u2014 thou well- watered land of fresh streams, When I gaze on thy hills greenly sloping, where the light of such loveliness beams, When I rest by the rim of thy fountains, or stray where thy streams disembogue, ' Then I think that the fairies have brought me to dwell in the bright Tir-na-n-oge.* But when on the face of thy chddren I look, and behold the big tears Still stream down their grief- eaten channels, which widen and deepen with years, I fear that some dark blight for ever will fall on thy harvests of peace, And that, like to thy lakes and thy rivers, thy sorrows must ever increase.f O land ! which the heavens made for joy, but where wretchedness buildeth its throne \u2014 O prodigal spendthrift of sorrow ! and hast thou not heirs of thine own ?

His children had grown into manhood, but, ah ! in that terrible night Which had fallen on fair Florence, they perished away in the thick of the fight ; Heart-blinded, his darling Francesca went seeking her sons through the gloom, And found them at length, and lay down full of love by their side in the tomb, That cottage, its vine-cover'd porch and its myrtle- bound garden of flowers, That church whence the bells with their voices, drown'd the sound of the fast-flying hours,"], [164, "136 THE BELL-FOUNDER. Both are levelled and laid in the dust, and the sweet- sounding bells have been torn From their downfallen beams, and away by the red hand of sacrilege borne. As the smith, in the dark, sullen smithy, striketh quick on the anvil below, Thus Fate on the heart of the old man struck rapidly blow after blow : Wife, children, and hope passed away from the heart once so burning and bold, As the bright shining sparks disappear when the red glowing metal grows cold. He missed not the sound of his bells while those death-sounds struck loud in his ears, He missed not the church where they rang while his old eyes were blinded with tears ; But the calmness of grief coming soon, in its sadness and silence profound, He listened once more as of old, hut in vain, for the joy-bearing sound. When he felt that indeed they had vanished, one fancy then flashed on his brain, One wish made his heart beat anew with a throbbing it could not restrain \u2014 'Twas to wander away from fair Florence, its memory and dream-haunted dells, And to seek up and down through the earth for the sound of its magical bells. They will speak of the hopes that have perished, and the joys that have faded so fast With the music of memory winged, they will seem but the voice of the past ; As, when the bright morning has vanished, and even- ing grows starless and dark, The nightingale song of remembrance recalls the sweet strain of the lark."], [165, "THE BELL-FOUNDER. 137 Thus restlessly wandering through Italy, now by the Adrian sea, In the shrine of Loreto, he bendeth his travel-tired suppliant knee ; And now by tfie brown troubled Tiber he taketh his desolate way, And in many a shady basdica fingers to listen and pray. He prays for the dear ones snatched from him, nor vainly nor hopelessly prays, For the strong faith in union hereafter like a beam o'er his cold bosom plays ; He listens at morning and evening, when matin and vesper bells toll, But their sweetest sounds grate on his ear, and their music is harsh to his soul. For though sweet are the bells that ring out from the tall campanili of Rome, Ah ! they are not the dearer and sweeter ones, tuned with the memory of home. So leaving proud Rome and fair Tivoli, southward the old man must stray, 'Till he reaches the Eden of waters that sparkle in Napoli's bay : He sees not the blue waves of Bai\u00e6, nor Ischia's sum- mits of brown, He sees but the high campanili that rise o'er each far-gleaming town. Driven restlessly onward, he saileth away to the bright land of Spain, And seeketh thy shrine, Santiago, and stands by the western main. A bark bound for Erin lay waiting, he entered like one in a dream ; Fair winds in the full purple sails led him soon to the Shannon's broad stream."], [166, "138 THE BELL-FOUNDER. 'Twas an evening that Florence might envy, so rich was the lemon-hued air, As it lay on lone Scattery's island, or lit the green mountains of Clare ; The wide-spreading old giant river rolled his waters as smooth and as still As if Oonagh, with all her bright nymphs, had come down from the far fairy hill,* To fling her enchantments around on the mountains, the air, and the tide, And to soothe the worn heart of the old man who looked from the dark vessel's side. Borne on the current the vessel glides smoothly but swiftly away, By Carrigaholt, and by many a green sloping head- land and bay, 'Twixt Cratloe's blue hills and green woods, and the soft sunny shores of Tervoe, And now the fair city of Limerick spreads out on the broad bank below ; Still nearer and nearer approaching, the mariners look o'er the town, The old man sees nought but St. Mary's square tower, with its battlements brown. He listens \u2014 as yet all is silent, but now, with a sud- den surprise, A ricfi peal of melody rings from that tower through the clear evening skies ! One note is enough \u2014 his eye moistens, his heart, long so wither'd, outswells, He has found them \u2014 the sons of his labours \u2014 his musical, magical bells ! * The beautiful hill in Lower Ormond called Knochshegowna, i.e., Oonagh's Hill, so called from being the fabled residence of Oonagh (or Una), the Fairy Queen of Spenser.

Stdl some scenes are yet enchanted by the charms that Nature granted, Still are peopled, still are haunted, by a graceful spirit band. Peace and beauty have their dwelling where the in- fant streams are welling, Where the mournful waves are knelling on Glengariff 's coral strand ; Or where, on Killarney's mountains, Grace and Terror smiling stand, Like sisters, fiand in hand ! Still we have a new romance in fire-sfiips tfirougfi the tamed sea glancing, And the snorting and the prancing of the mighty engine steed ; Still, Astolpho-hke, we wander tfirougfi the boundless azure yonder, Realizing what seemed fonder than the magic tales we read : Tales of wdd Arabian wonder, where the fancy all is freed \u2014 Wilder far indeed ! * The pass of Keim-an-eigh (the path of the deer) lies to the south-west of Inchageela, in the direction of Bantry Bay."], [169, "141 ALICE AND UNA.

With two glories shining o'er them, up the coming years they'll climb, Earth's great evening as its prime ! With a sigh for what is fading, but, 0 Earth ! with no upbraiding, For we feel that time is braiding newer, fresher flowers for thee, We will speak, despite our grieving, words of loving and believing, Tales we vowed when we were leaving awful Ceim- an- eich, Where the sever'd rocks resemble fragments of a frozen sea, And the wild deer flee !

As a hunter, danger daring, with his dogs the brown moss sharing, Little thinking, little caring, long a wayward youth lived he ; But his bounding heart was regal, and he looked as looks the eagle, And he flew as flies the beagle, who the panting stag doth see : Love, who spares a fellow-archer, long had let him wander free Through wild Ceim-an-eich ! But at length the hour drew nigher when his heart should feel that fire ; Up the mountain high and higher had he hunted from the dawn ; Till the weeping fawn descended, where the earth and ocean blended, And with hope its slow way wended to a little grassy lawn ; It is safe, for gentle Alice to her saving breast hath drawn . Her almost sister fawn. Alice was a chieftain's daughter, and, though many suitors sought her, She so loved Glengariff's water that she let her lovers pine ; Her eye was beauty's palace, and her cheek an ivory chalice, Through which the blood of Alice gleamed soft as rosiest wine, And her lips like lusmore blossoms which the fairies intertwine,* And her heart a golden mine. * The lusmore (or fairy cap), literally the great herb, Digi alis purpurea."], [171, "ALICE AND UNA. 143 She was gentler and shyer than the light fawn that stood by her, And her eyes emit a fire soft and tender as her soul ; Love's dewy fight doth drown her, and the braided locks that crown her Than autumn's trees are browner, when the golden shadows roll Through the forests in the evening, when cathedral turrets toll, . And the purple sun advanceth to its goal. Her cottage was a dwelling all regal homes excelling, But, ah ! beyond the telling was the beauty round it spread : The wave and sunshine playing, like sisters each arraying, Far down the sea-plants swaying upon their coral bed, As langtrid as the tresses on a sleeping maiden's head, When the summer breeze is dead. Need we say that Maurice loved her, and that no blush reproved her When her throbbing bosom moved her to give the heart she gave ; That by dawnlight and by twilight, and, 0 blessed moon ! by thy fight, When the twinkling stars on high fight the wanderer o'er the wave, His steps uneonscious led him where Glengarifl's waters lave Each mossy bank and cave.

As summer ligfitning dances amid tfie heavens' ex- panses, Thus shone the burning glances of those flashing fairy eyes ; Three splendours there were shining, three passions intertwining, Despair and hope combining their deep- contrasted dyes, With jealousy's green lustre, as troubled ocean vies With the blue of summer skies ! She was a fairy creature, of heavenly form and feature, Not Venus' self could teach her a newer, sweeter grace, Not Venus' self could lend her an eye so dark and tender, Half softness and half splendour, as lit her lily face; And as the choral planets move harmonious through- out space, There was music in her pace."], [173, "ALICE AND UNA. 145 But when at times she started, and her blushing lips were parted, And a pearly lustre darted from her teetfi so ivory white, You'd think you saw the gliding of two rosy clouds dividing, And the crescent they were hiding gleam forth upon your sight Through these lips, as though the portals of a heaven pure and bright, Came a breathing of delight ! Though many an elf-king loved her, and elf- dames grave reproved her, The hunter's daring movedher more wildly everyhour; Unseen she roamed beside him, to guard him and to guide him, But now she must divide him from her human rival's power. Ah ! Alice ! \u2014 gentle Alice ! the storm begins to lower That may crush Glengariff's flower !

If ever mortal needed that council, surely he did ; But the wile has now succeeded \u2014 he wanders from his path ; The cloud its lightning sendeth, and its bolt the stout oak rendeth, And the arbutus back bendeth in the whirlwind, as a lath !

What words have we for painting the momentary fainting That the rider's heart is tainting, as decay doth taint a corse ? But who will stoop to chiding, in a fancied courage priding, When we know that he is riding the fearful Phooka Horse ?* Ah ! his heart beats quick and faster than the smitings of remorse As he sweepeth through the wild grass and gorse ! * The Phooka is described as belonging to the malignant class of fairy beings, and he is as wild and capricious in his character as he is changeable in his form.

It is the fawn that fled him, and that late to Alice led him, But now it does not dread him, as it feigned to do before, When down the mountain gliding, in that sheltered meadow hiding, It left his heart abiding by wild Glengariff 's shore : For it was a gentle fairy who the fawn's light form thus wore, And who watched sweet Alice o'er. * Mialloch, \" the murmuring river\" at Glengariff. \u2014 Smith's \"Cork.\" t Glashenglora, a mountain torrent, which finds its way into the Atlantic Ocean through Glengariff, in the west of the county of Cork.

And tfie fawn beside him gliding o'er the rough and broken soil, Without fear and without toil.

I dreamt a dream, a dazzhng dream, of a green isle far away, Where the glowing West to the ocean's breast calleth the dying day ; And that island green was as fair a scene as ever man's eye did see, With its chieftains bold and its temples old, and its homes and its altars free ! No foreign foe did that green isle know, no stranger band it bore, Save the merchant train from sunny Spain, and from Afric's golden shore ! And the young man's heart would fondly start, and the old man's eye would smile, As their thoughts would roam o'er the ocean foam to that lone and \" holy isle !\" Years passed by, and the orient sky blazed with a new- born light, And Bethlehem's star shone bright afar o'er the lost world's darksome night; And the diamond shrines from plundered mines, and the golden fanes of Jove, Melted away in the blaze of day at the simple spell- word \u2014 Love !"], [189, "161 A DREAM. The light serene o'er that island green played with its saving beams, And the fires of Baal waxed dim and pale like the stars in the morning streams ! And 'twas joy to hear, in the bright air clear, from out each sunny glade, The tinkling bell, from the quiet cell, or the cloister's tranquil shade ! A cloud of night o'er that dream so bright soon with its dark wing came, And the happy scene of that island green was lost in blood and shame ; For its kings unjust betrayed their trust, and its queens, though fair, were frail, And a robber band, from a stranger land, with their war-whoops filled the gale ; A fatal spell on that green isle fell, a shadow of death and gloom Passed withering o'er, from shore to shore, like the breath of the foul simoom ; And each green hill's side was crimson dyed, and each stream rolled red and wild, With the mingled blood of the brave and good \u2014 of mother and maid and child ! Dark was my dream, though many a gleam of hope through that black night broke, Like a star's bright form through a whistling storm, or the moon through a midnight oak ! And many a time, with its wings sublime, and its robes of saffron light, Would the morning rise on the eastern skies, but to vanish again in night !

At length arose o'er that isle of woes a dawn with a steadier smile, And in happy hour a voice of power awoke the slum- bering isle ! And the people all obeyed the call of their chief's un- sceptred hand, Vowing to raise, as in ancient days, the name of their own dear land ! My dream grew bright as the sunbeam's light, as I watched that isle's career, Through the varied scene and the joys serene of many a future year ; And, oh ! what a thrill did my bosom fill as I gazed on a pillared pile, Where a senate once more in power watched o'er the rights of that lone green isle !

He sent fier stems of living gold From the rich plains of western lands, And purple-gushing grapes from vines Born of the amorous sun that shines Where Tagus rolls its golden sands, Or Guadalete old. And citrons from Firenze's fields, And golden apples from the isles That gladden the bright southern seas, True home of the Hesperides : Which now no dragon guards, but smiles, The bounteous mother, as she yields. And then the king grew old like Lear \u2014 His blood waxed chill, his beard grew gray ; He changed his sceptre for a staff : And as the thoughtless children laugh To see him totter on his way, He knew his destined hour was near.

No year of all those years had fled, No day had dawned that was not red, (Oft shed by fratricidal hand), With the best blood of all the land. And now, at last, the fight seemed o'er, The sound of battle pealed no more ; Abject the prostrate people lay, Nor dared to hope a better day ; An icy chill, a fatal frost, Left them with all but honour lost, Left them with only trust in God, The lands were gone their fathers owned ; Poor pariahs on their native sod. Their faith was banned, their prophets stoned; Their temples crowning every height, Now echoed with an alien rite, Or sflent lay each mouldering pile, With shattered cross and ruined aisle. Letters denied, forbade to pray, And white- winged commerce scared away All, what can rouse the dormant life That still survives the stormier strife ? What potent charm can once again Relist the cross, rebuild the fane ? Free learning from felonious chains, And give to youth immortal gains ? What signal mercy from on high ? \u2014 Hush ! hark ! I hear an infant's cry, The answer of a new-born child, From Iveragh's far mountain wild. Yes, 'tis the cry of a child, feeble and faint in the night, But soon to thunder in tones that will rouse both tyrants and slaves. Yes, 'tis the sob of a stream just awake in its source on the height, But soon to spread as a sea, and rush with the roar- ing of waves."], [249, "O'CONNELL. 221 Yes, 'tis the cry of a child affection hastens to still, But what shall silence ere long the victor voice of the man ?

And soon the torrent wdl run, and the pent-up waters o'erflow, For the chdd has risen to a man, and a shout replaces the cry ; And a voice rings out through the world, so winged with Erin's woe, That charmed are the nations to listen, and the Destinies to reply. Boyhood had passed away from that child, predestined by fate To dry the eyes of his mother, to end the worst of her ills, And the terrible record of wrong, and the annals of hell and hate, Had gathered into his breast like a lake in the heart of the hills. Brooding over the past, he found himself but a slave, With manacles forged on his mind, and fetters on every limb ; The land that was life to others, to him was only a grave, And however the race he ran no victor wreath was for him. The fane of learning was closed, shut out was the light of day, No ray from tfie sun of science, no brightness from Greece or Rome, And those who hungered for knowledge, like him, had to fly away, Where bountiful France threw wide the gates that \u2022were shut at home."], [250, "222 CENTENARY ODES.

The steps of honour were barred : it was not for him to climb, No glorious goal in the future, no prize for the labour of life, And the fate of him and his people seemed fixed for all coming time To hew the wood of the helot and draw the waters of strife. But the glorious youth returning Back from France the fair and free, Rage within his bosom burning, Such a servile sight to see, Vowed to heaven it should not be. \"No !\" the youthful champion cried, \" Mother Ireland, widowed bride, If thy freedom can be won By the service of a son, Then, behold that son in me.

A dazzling gleam of evanescent glory, Had passed away, and all was dark once more, One golden page fiad lit the mournful story, Which ruthless hands with envious rage out-tore. One glorious sun-burst, radiant and far-reaching, Had pierced the cloudy veil dark ages wove, When full-arnied Freedom rose from Grattan's teach- ing, As sprang Minerva from the brain of Jove. Oh ! in the transient light that had outbroken, How all the land with quickening fire was fit ! What golden words of deathless speech were spoken, What ligfitning flashes of immortal wit ! Letters and arts l'evived beneath its beaming, Commerce and Hope outspread their swelling sails, And with \" Free Trade \" upon their standard gleaming, Now feared no foes and dared adventurous gales. Across the stream the graceful arch extended, Above the pile the rounded dome arose, The soaring spire to heaven's high fault ascended, The loom hummed loud as bees at evening's close. And yet 'mid all this hope and animation, The people still lay bound in bigot chains, Freedom that gave some slight alleviation, Could dare no panacea for their pains. Yet faithful to their country's quick uprising, Like some fair island from volcanic waves, They shared the triumph though their claims despising, And hailed the freedom though themselves were slaves."], [252, "224 CENTENARY ODES.

Then the mighty work began, Then the war of thirty years \u2014 Peaceful war, when words were spears, And religion led the van.

There at his feet a captive wretch lay bound, Hideous, deformed, of baleful countenance, Whom as his blood-shot eye-balls glared around, As if to kill with their malignant glance, I knew to be the fiend Intolerance.

Never till then, in victory's hour, Had a conqueror felt a joy so sweet, As when the wand of the well- won power O'Connell laid at his country's feet. \" No ! not for me, nor for mine alone,\" The generous victor cried, \" Have I fought, But to see my Eire again on her throne ; Ah, that was my dream and my guiding thought."], [255, "O'CONNELL. 227 To see my Eire again on her throne, Her tresses with lilies and shamrocks twined, Her severed sons to a nation grown, Her hostile hues in one flag combined ; Her wisest gathered in grave debate, Her bravest armed to resist the foe : To see my country ' glorious and great,' \u2014 To see her ' free,' \u2014 to fight I go ! \" And forth he went to the peaceful fight, And the millions rose at his words of fire, As the lightning's leap from the depth of the night, And circle some mighty minster's spire : Ah, ill had it fared with the hapless land, If the power that had roused could not restrain ? If the bolts were not grasped in a glowing hand To be hurled in peals of thunder again ?

Once more with, the golden glory of words Were the youthful orator's lips inspired, Till he touched the heart to its tenderest chords, And quickened the pulse which his voice had fired.

Then seeking the feet of God's High Priest, He slept by the soft Ligurian Sea, Leaving a fight, like the Star in the East, To lead the land that will yet be free. 1875.

THE IRISH EMIGRANT'S MOTHER. \" Oh ! come, my mother, come away, across the sea- green water ; Oh ! come with me, and come with him, the husband of thy daughter; Oh ! come with us, and come with them, the sister and the brother, Who, prattling climb thy aged knees, and cad thy daughter \u2014 mother. \" Oh ! come, and leave this land of death \u2014 this isle of desolation \u2014 This speck upon the sunbright face of God's sublime creation,"], [310, "282 MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. Since now o'er aU our fatal stars the most malign hath risen, When Labour seeks the poorhouse, and Innocence the prison. '\"Tis true, o'er ad the sun-brown fields the husky wheat is bending ; Tis true, God's blessed hand at last a better time is sending ; 'Tis true the island's aged face looks happier and younger, But in the best of days we've known the sickness and the hunger. \" When health breathed out in every breeze, too oft we've known the fever \u2014 Too oft, my mother, have we felt the hand of the bereaver : Too well remember many a time the mournful task that brought him, When freshness fanned the summer ah, and cooled the glow of autumn. \" But then the trial, though severe, stdl testified our patience, We bowed witfi mingled hope and fear to God's wise dispensations ; We felt the gloomiest time was both a promise and a warning, Just as the darkest hour of night is herald of the morning. \" But now through all the black expanse no hopeful morning breaketh \u2014 No bird of promise in our hearts the gladsome song awaketh ; No far-off gleams of good fight up the hills of ex- pectation \u2014 Nought but the gloom that might precede the world's annihdation."], [311, "THE IRISH EMIGRANT'S MOTHER. 283 \" So, mother, turn thy aged feet, and let our chil- dren lead 'em Down to the ship that wafts us soon to plenty and to freedom ; Forgetting nought of ad the past, yet all the past forgiving ; Come, let us leave the dying land, and fly unto the living. \" They ted us, they who read and think of Ireland's ancient story, How once its emerald flag flung out a sunburst's fleeting glory Oh ! if that sun will pierce no more the dark clouds that efface it, Fly where the rising stars of heaven commingle to replace it. \" So come, my mother, come away, across the sea- green water ; Oh ! come with us, and come with him, the husband of thy daughter ; Oh! come with us, and come with them, the sister and the brother, Who, prattling, climb thy aged knees, and call tfiy daughter \u2014 mother. \" \"Ah! go, my chddren, go away, obey this inspiration ; Go ,with the mantling fiopes of health and youthful expectation; Go, clear the forests, climb tfie hills, and plough the expectant prairies ; Go, in the sacred name of God, and the Blessed Virgin Mary's. \" But though I feel how sharp the pang from thee and thine to sever, To look upon these darhng ones the last time and for ever;"], [312, "284 MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. Yet in this sad and dark old land, by desolation haunted, My heart has struck its roots too deep ever to be transplanted. \" A thousand fibres stid have life, although the trunk is dying, They twine around the yet green grave where thy father's bones are lying ; Ah ! from that sad and sweet embrace no soil on earth can loose 'em, Though golden harvests gleam on its breast, and golden sands in its bosom. \" Others are twined around the stone, where ivy- blossoms smother The crumbling lines tfiat trace your names, my father and my mother ; God's blessing be upon their souls \u2014 God grant, my old heart prayeth, Their names be written in the Book whose writing ne'er decayeth, \" Alas ! my prayers would never warm within those great cold buildings, Those grand cathedral churches with their marbles and their gddings ; Far fitter than the proudest dome that would hang in splendour o'er me, Is the simple chapel's white-washed wall, where my people knelt before me. \" No doubt it is a glorious land to which you now are going, Like that which God bestowed of old, with milk and honey flowing ; But where are the blessed saints of God, whose lives of his law remind me, Like Patrick, Brigid, and Columkille, in the land I'd leave behind me ?"], [313, "TME IRISH EMIGRANT'S MOTHER. 285 \" So leave me here, my children, with my old ways and old notions ; Leave me here in peace,with my memories and devo- tions ; Leave me in sight of your father's grave, and as the heavens allied us, Let not, since we were joined in life, even tfie grave divide us. \" There's not a week but I can hear how you prosper better and better, For the mighty fire-ships o'er the sea will bring the expected letter ; And if I need aught for my simple wants, my food or my winter firing, You will gladly spare from your growing store a little for my requiring. \" Remember with a pitying love the hapless land that bore you ; At every festal season be its gentle form before you ; When the Christmas candle is lighted, and the holly and ivy glisten, Let your eye look back for a vanished face \u2014 for a voice that is silent, listen ! \" So go, my children, go away \u2014 obey this inspiration; Go, with the mantling fiopes of health and youthful expectation ; Go, clear the forests, climb the hills, and plough the expectant prairies ; Go, in the sacred name of God, and the Blessed Virgin Mary's.\""], [314, "286 MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. THE RAIN: A SONG OF PEACE* The Rain, the Rain, the beautdul Rain \u2014 Welcome, welcome, it cometh again ; It cometh with green to gladden the plain, And to wake the sweets in the winding lane. The Rain, the Rain, the beautiful Rain, It fills the flowers to their tiniest vein, Tid they rise from the sod whereon they had lain Ah, me ! ah, me ! like an army slain. The Rain, the Rain, the beautiful Rain, Each drop is a link of a diamond chain That unites the earth with its sin and its stain To the radiant realm where God doth reign. The Rain, the Rain, the beautiful Rain, Each drop is a tear not shed in vain, Which the angels weep for the golden grain All trodden to death on the goz'y plain ; For the Rain, the Rain, the beautiful Rain, Will waken the golden seeds again ! But, ah ! what power will revive the slain, Stark lying in death over fair Lorraine ? 'Twere better far, 0 beautiful Rain, That you swelled the torrent and flooded the main And that Winter, with all his spectral train, Alone lay camped on the icy plain. * Written during the Franco-German war."], [315, "287 THE RAIN. For then, 0 Rain, 0 beautdul Rain, The snow-flag of peace were unfurl'd again ; And the truce would be rung in each loud refrain Of the blast replacing the bugle's strain. Then welcome, welcome, beautiful Rain, Thou bringest flowers to the parched-up plain; Oh ! for many a frenzied heart and brain, Bring peace and love to the world again August 28, 1870. THE END. M. H.
