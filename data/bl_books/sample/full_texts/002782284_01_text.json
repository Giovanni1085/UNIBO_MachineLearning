HE present volume contains a trilogy of dramas which, although known to ha\"ve once existed, has lain perdu to the world from the time of its com- position, except with regard to the third part. That third part was twice printed in 1606, rather more than four years after the date of its first representation ; was reprinted in the last century; was included a few years ago in Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt's edition of Dodsley's Select Plays ; and in 1879 obtained a place in Prof. Arber's English Scholar's Library. But why this third part should alone have been published by its author does not clearly appear ; it was described by its eighteenth-century editor, Thos. Hawkins, in somewhat exaggerated terms, as being ' perhaps the most singular composition in our language,' but its singularity of design and character is shared equally by the earlier parts, which display alsp as much humour and are fuller of illus- trations of the academic life of the period. They have, unhappily, as much too of that coarseness which is such a blot on the popular literature of the time, but they have no such pages of repulsive rant as are assigned at the close of the third part to the extravagant characters Furor Poeticus and Phantasma. Probably the secret of the greater popularity of the third part may be found in the personal satire expressed in the character of the Recorder. In him is personified Francis Brackyn, who in his office as Re corder of Cambridge incurred extreme unpopularity in the b"], [12, "VI preface. University by maintaining the right of the Mayor to precedency over the Vice-Chancellor in certain cases.1 He had already been satirized in Club-Law, a play acted at Clare Hall in 1597-8 ; and it is possible that he may also be the lawyer who at a later date figures as Ignoramus in Ruggles' famous comedy. It may well be that it was on this account that the last part of our trilogy won the greater popularity amongst the academic auditors to whose sympathies it appealed ; and the prominence given through its second title, The Scourge of Simony, to that portion of the play which represents the lawyer's co-operation with a patron in the sale of an ecclesiastical benefice, makes it also probable that the latter greedy reprobate, called by the different names of Sir Frederick, Sir Raderick, and Sir Randall, may have been some other easily recognised and notorious character of the time. It was only some twenty-five years before that a statute had been passed (13 Eliz. cap. 6) forbidding the taking money for presentation to a vacant benefice, and making that an offence by civil law which had before been only cognizable under canon law, but no doubt unscrupulous patrons and lawyers had already begun to find ways for driving the proverbial coach and horses through the technicalities of the enactment. The first two comedies are now printed from a MS. preserved in one of Thomas Hearne's volumes of miscellane ous collections in the Bodleian Library. With a true sense of the possible value to others, if not to himself, of all remnants of earlier times, of the very rags of writings, Hearne (who, in the words of his self-written epitaph, ' studied and preserved antiquities ' in a way for which we of the later generations can never be too grateful) stored up 1 See Mr. James Bass Mullinger's University of Cambridge 1535-1625, published in 1SS4, p. 526.

His MSS. now form part of Dr. Richard Rawlinson's vast collection ; and there, in one of his mixed volumes numbered Rawlinson D 398, I met with these lost plays. The MS. consists of twenty folio leaves (besides one outside leaf) written evidently by a copyist, who, as evidently, has sometimes been unable to read, or too careless to read, his original correctly. The stage directions are written in pale red ink. There is a curious peculiarity in the scribe's spelling, which may perhaps help to determine his provincial locality; words ending in ce, such as ' once,' ' fence,' ' hence,' are written without the final e, ' one,' ' fenc,' ' henc.: And ' they ' is frequently used for ' the.' On the outside leaf is written, as an owner's name, ' Edmunde Rishton, Lancastrensis.' It is possible that, as the plays were acted at St. John's College, this person was a member of the College ; but as un fortunately the registers there only reach back to the year 1634 (as I am informed by Mr. J. B. Mullinger), there are no means of tracing him through College records. Nor has Mr. J. Eglington Bailey, whose knowledge with respect to the families and worthies of Lancashire is extensive and well known, been able to identify him by this his short local description of himself. And while this mark of owner ship connects this MS. with a northern county, it is worthy of notice that the second MS., to be described further on, came to its present possessor's hands from a library in the north.1 We should be prepared therefore to look thither for the author ; and in the prologue to the second play we seem to find some evidence that he was a native of Cheshire. The two lines in the professed description of the author, ' Hee never since durst name a peece of cheese, Though Chessire seems to priviledge his name,' ' The provincial philologist will, I believe, find words of northern use not infrequent ; e.g. ' sooping.' b 2"], [14, "preface. VIII appear to connect him with that county, although the allusion is one which, in our ignorance of the author, defies explanation. If the lines preceding these are to be taken au serieux, and not simply as jocular, he was one who had failed to secure his B.A. hood at Cambridge, and had migrated thence to Germany, where he had at last obtained some ' silie poore degree ' ; and then, it would seem, had returned to his Alma Mater. The plays were all of them ' Christmas toys.' The date of the third has been proved from internal evidence (see Prof. Arber's Introduction to his reprint) to be December, 1 60 1. The fresh readings in the prologue to that play, which have been gained from Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps' MS., show us that the first part (which Was written in three days) was acted four years before, i.e. in December, 1597, and that the third was the final conclusion of the series. That prologue tells us also that the author and a friend, described as the Philomusus and Studioso of the comedies, had meanwhile been to Italy, which we learn also from the fourth scene of the first act. The two friends represent themselves as having contemplated, in the mercenary hope of profitable preferment, secession abroad to that Roman Faith for which many others had at that time abandoned both Cambridge and Oxford, but finding that ' discontented clerks ' could not get a cardinal's cap as easily as they expected, the}' preferred want at home to mendicancy at Rome or Rheims ; in this, no doubt, satirizing the supposed motives of some of the Roman converts. We learn too that the earlier plays had been acted more. than once at Cambridge, although some of the allusions which appear to imply this, viz. those to the ' sophisters' knocks ' and the ' butler's box,' are by no means clear. In the former printed texts of the third play there are frequent passages which are unintelligible from errors of the press. These are now rendered clear by readings"], [15, "preface. IX gained from a MS. in the possession of Mr. Halliwell- Phillipps, for the use of which I am greatly indebted to that gentleman. The new readings show how fair a field is really open to conjecture in the attempted correction of old texts for which no MS. authority exists, and justify much of the conjectural criticism which is applied to Shakespearean difficulties.1 They prove also the critical acumen and ingenuity of Edm. Malone,' since several of the corrections are found to correspond with emendations noted by him, as apparently his own guesses, in the margins of one of his printed copies.2 The MS. in question forms a small quarto volume, in a parchment cover, and is written by a contemporary hand. There is no trace of authorship or ownership ; but it came to its present possessor's hands from an old family library, where it may well have been from the days of James I. It has already been mentioned that this third play was twice printed in the year 1606. Both the editions were printed at London by G. Eld for John Wright, and are exactly similar in title-page and appearance. But there are frequent verbal variations in their texts. The one which is here designated in the foot-notes as ' B ' is that which was used by Mr. Arber for his reprint. Unfortunately this is by far (as the notes show) the less correct of the two. The other, designated as ' A,' has been adopted in the main for the text here given, with the corrections of the MS. (enclosed in brackets) and occasionally a few correc tions also from ' B.' Of both these editions there are copies in Malone's collection in the Bodleian Library. For illustrations of University life and scholars' struggles 1 It is needless here to point out to those who will examine text and notes the many corrections which are gained from the MS. It is enough to refer to p. 87 for the important correction in the first of the lines upon Shakespeare, and to p. 1 39 for the reading of ' size que ' for ' sice kne.' ' These places are pointed out in the footnotes of the various readings."], [16, "preface X the newly-recovered plays will be found very curious and interesting. Very witty and amusing, too. and full of real life-like character, are the pictures of the carrier Leonard and the tapster Simson, and the village churchwarden Perceval. But the chief interest lies in the fresh notices afforded of Shakespeare, of so early a date as 1600. The quotations with which Gullio interlards his discourse, and which he appropriates as his own, the respect with which he speaks of the poet as ' Mr. Shakspeare,' his declaration that he will have his picture in his study and keep his Venus and Adonis under his pillow, and the preference which he gives at once to lines that profess to imitate Shakespeare before those which imitate Chaucer and Spenser, are all signs of the popularity which had already been won. But it is popu- larity only with a certain class. The notices in the third play seem (as Mr. Mullinger has remarked, Univ. of Cambr. p. 524 n) ' to convey the notion that Shakespeare is the favourite of the rude half-educated strolling players, as distinguished from the refined geniuses of the University.' And those in the second play, which all come from the mouth of Gullio, the arrant braggart, the empty pretender to knowledge, and the avowed libertine, and from his page, tend to show that while the Venus and Adonis was the best known of the already published writings, this in the esteem of Cambridge scholars made Shakespeare to be re garded as specially being the favourite of the class which that character represents. Certainly the popularity assigned to him is not of a sort to be desired ; but the popularity itself is indisputable. A comparison with Bishop Hall's Satires brings to view a great similarity alike in subjects and in language. The second book of the Satires deals, in fact, with many of the abuses of which our unknown author treats. The second satire in that book is a complaint of the poverty of scholars ;"], [17, "preface. XI the third deals with lawyers; the fourth with doctors1; the fifth with the growing sin of simony, in relation to which we meet with the same term of ' steeple-fair ' which is used infra at p. 137 ; the sixth is respecting the engagement of a tutor, in which the conditions are very nearly identical, and the payment wholly so, ' five marks and winter livery.' The Satires were first printed in 1597 ; and the coincidences are so many and striking that it is plain that the writer of the plays had them at least freshly in remembrance, and may even have been consciously borrowing ideas from them. It may be well to mention that in the first two plays I have supplied the punctuation, the MS. itself being but scantily pointed. In regard to the third I have followed the example of previous editors, and have left the punctuation as it is found in the edition of 1606 noted as A, bad and irregular as that often is, and have also retained capital letters as there given, in order that the text of that edition may be correctly represented. 1 By both writers the medical consultation-fee is said to be a groat ; to which in the play the patient of his bounty adds eight pence."], [18, "CONTENTS.

JohnSeton, a Fellow of St. John's College, Chap lain to Bishop Gardiner, and Canon of Winchester, but one who was deprived of bis preferments as a recusant on the accession of Queen Elizabeth, wrote a treatise on Logic, on Aristotelian lines, which was for some years the recog nised text-book at Cambridge. While the treatise of Ramus, the anti-Aristo telian (whose system was eagerly adopted by Calvinistic Protestants, partly because its author was a Calvinist), was the favourite book with the New School, the men of the Old School adhered to Seton. ' Thomas Dranta,' in prefixing encomiastic verses to an edition of Seton by P. Carter in 1577, is careful at the same time to give special praise to Ramus as the* popular teacher at that time. 5. 137. Pacius. Julius Pacius (born at Vicenza in 1550, died in 1635) wrote a treatise on Logic 'in usum Scholae Sedanensis.' 5. 138. Carterus. Peter Carter, Fellow of St. John's College (living in 1577), wrote annotations on the Dialectica of his brother collegian Seton, which were often printed with it ; but to understand the allusion in the text to his vindication of Pacius would probably require such an acquaintance with their respective treatises as ne vaut pas la chandelle, at least to the present Editor. 8. 212-3.

It begins 'Here lies fat Gullio,' and describes him as one who had been hanged at Tyburn in 1598. That Weaver was a Cambridge man appears from references to ' Granta ' in commendatory verses prefixed to his Epigrams.

The idea of this dialogue in question and answer with Echo is probably taken from a like dialogue in Book II of Sir P. Sidney's Arcadia. The quota tion of ' Jove's breakfast ' at p. 100, 1. 653 is probably from the same work. 110. 1256.
