In presenting the first Part of the History of West Gower to the public, the Author has to acknowledge the invaluable assistance rendered by his friend, Mr. Henry Grove, in obtaining from the Record Office in London the transcripts of an immense number of ancient documents \u2014 many of them previously un known \u2014 from which a vast deal of authentic information has been derived, respecting persons and places of note in this district in former times. He has also to express his thanks to Col. G. Grant Francis, F.S.A., for many useful suggestions ; to Mr. J. M. Lloyd, Barrister, of Lincoln's Inn, for much kind help ; to Mr. Dudley G. Cary Elwes, F.S.A., for the De Braose pedigree and other information, which he was good enough to supply, relating to this family ; to C. R. Mansel Talbot, Esq., M.P., for permission to peruse the splendid collection of ancient documents preserved at Penrice Castle, ranging from Henry III., to Charles II. , and probably the finest private collection of old records in the kingdom. Several of the woodcuts illustrating the historical notices of the parishes, which will follow in due course, are from drawings by the late Sir Gardner \"Wilkinson, F.G.S. My best thanks are due to Mrs. \"Wood, of Stouthall, who placed many of her coloured sketches at my disposal ; to Miss Talbot for drawings of many of the curiosities preserved at Penrice Castle ; to Mrs. Traherne, of Coedriglan, for much valuable information, and for the drawing of the singular bone ornament found in Paviland cave, by Mr. Daniel Davies, Surgeon, in 1831. The Churches, with few exceptions, have been engraved from photographs ; and a fair proportion of the antiquities of the place are from the Author's own sketches ; and lastly, among those who have kindly con tributed the offerings of their pencils to this part of the work, he has to mention the names of Lt. \"W.

Mentioned as it is in the Triads ; abounding in ancient military works and old baronial castles, it has been the scene of many a furious fight, and has also heard within its bounds the voices of some of the most notable saints of the days of old. I may here mention, that it is one of those places that claim the honour of being the birth-place of the great St. Patrick ; for an old Welsh tradition states that he was the son of Mawon, a native of the country of Gwyr, or Gower, in Glamorganshire. Numerous fossil bone caves pierce the frontage of its cliffs ; the cradle of many a wild and romantic legend, it would be difficult to find a locality of such limited dimensions so full of interest to the traveller or arch\u00e6ologist. The collecting and arrangement of the matter contained in this \"Work ; the translation of many of the ancient Latin docu ments, and the gathering together the folk lore of the district, has been to the Author, in the seclusion of a country parsonage, a source of pleasant recreation for years, and he now offers it to the public, with the hope that it may be the means of rescuing from oblivion many of the old customs and traditions of the district, and of throwing some light upon the ancient history of Wes. Gower."], [11, "CHAPTER I. ON THE ORIGIN AND MEANING OF THE WORD GOWER, AVITH SOME INFORMATION RESPECTING ITS EARLY INHABITANTS. The Etymology of the name Gower naturally forms the first chapter of the history of the place to which it refers; and, in entering upon an enquiry of this kind, the first thing to be done (as Mr. Isaac Taylor, in his \" Words and Places,\" properly re marks) is to discover the language from which the name has been derived. The next is to ascertain the early documentary form in which it is to be found. The word is \"Welsh, and the earliest form in which it is given is Gwyr. It is thus written in the Triads, which since Sharon Turner's able vindication of them as genuine and authentic records, must be admitted to be of a very venerable antiquity. Taliesin, in the sixth century, speaking of Gower, calls it Caer Wair, evidently a mistake^-not of the bard, but of some copyist, for Caer Wyr (Caer Gwyr), the letter g being dropped by the peculiarity of the language. So also Lewis Glyn Cothi, in the 15th cent., speaking of Swansea, calls it Caer Wyr (the fortress of Gower land). The expression Tir Gwyr is sometimes met with in old Welsh MSS. The people in the eastern parts of the county of Glamorgan, when speaking of Gower, make use of the expression Obry-Wyr, pronounced Obrowyr, which means the men of yonder land, or the men below. There is a curious affinity between this word Obrywyr, and the word Hebrew, as applied to the Israelites. It is generally supposed that the Jews, who are also called Hebrews, took this latter title from Heber, one of the ancestors of Abraham. The more probable origin of the name is from Obr \u2014 the distant land, or the land beyond \u2014 as if beyond all other lands: a word which in the Hebrew, as well as the Welsh language, conveys precisely the same meaning; and as applied to Abraham and his clan, or tribe, conveys the idea of their coming from some B"], [12, "2 remote place beyond the Euphrates. Vide Higgins on the \" Celtic Druids,\" p. 68. The word Gobir, Guihir, and Guohir. as used by Nennius,. and some of the medieval historians, is only the Latinized form of the Welsh Gwyr. In the old French Romances of King Arthur, it is written Gohre, and Gore. The form in which it now appears, Gower, is of course merely the English mode of rendering the old Welsh name. It has justly been observed, that names were never given at random, but all had some meaning when first imposed, it being a custom of the greatest antiquity in naming places, for the people to call them in their own language by some term de scriptive of their peculiarities, or of something or other, on account of which they were remarkable and worthy of being remembered. In the most ancient records we have \u2014 those of the Old Testament \u2014 we find numerous examples of this sort. Jacob sets up his stone pillow on the spot where he had seen the vision of angels, and calls it Bethel (God's house). Again, the heaps of stones set up by Jacob and Laban, some years after, had names given them significant of the iutention and object for which they had been piled together, being called the heaps of witness, in remembrance of the treaty of peace which had been there entered into between the patriarch and his father-in-law, that neither of them was to pass over those stones to injure the other. A num ber of other instances may be given. I have, however, only quoted the above, as showing the custom of marking places, boundaries, and the execution of covenants by cairns, and stones set on end, inasmuch as memorials of this kind, still existing in Gower, give an interest and support to a theory, which finds favour with some persons, that Gower takes its name from the pitched stones or rude columns, yet to be seen in different parts of the district, and called in Welsh, Meini Gwyr (stone men), from their fancied resemblance to the human figure.* It is very probable that these pitched stones were at one time more numerous than now. A few only remain. The most re markable are a huge Monolith called Sampson's Jack, on Mansel- \u2022 Scripture tells us of the Israelitish images set up on every high hill and under every green tree. It is worthy of remark that the word images (Matzebah) is literally a rude stone."], [13, "3 fold farm, in the parish of Lanrhidian, with several others, not quite so large, in the adjoining fields. There were, until very lately, two of considerable size in a field at Lagadranta,* one of which was removed by the present tenant of the farm, the other by his father, as they interfered with the cultivation of the land. On different parts of Cefn Bryn large stones may be seen, which have been thrown down purposely, while others, from the lapse of time have fallen from their perpendicular, and lie in a more or less inclined position. Other places on the same hill show the site of former Dolmens f wilfully demolished, the ponderous stones of which they were once constructed, being a confused heap of ruins. A pitched stone, of large size, now stands on the road side fronting the gate of Llanrhidian Church ; this, however, is not in situ having been moved from where it originally stood, not far off, and placed in its present situation, some thirty years ago, by the Rev. E. K. James, then curate of the parish. A still larger one was found in Stouthall Park, and was removed by Col. Wood a few years ago, and erected in another part of the grounds, and now forms a conspicuous object from the turnpike road. A stone about ten feet long, and averaging nearly eighteen inches square, may be seen lying near the Rectory House, Reynoldston, some thirty yards from the roadside. Travellers and antiquaries must take care not to be misled by the circle of stones in the upper part of Stouthall Park. This miniature representation of Stonehenge was set up by the father of the late John Lucas, Esq., about seventy years ago, and is nothing more than a whim of that gentleman. Passing from the artificial to those genuine marks of antiquity, about which there can be no manner of doubt, I would observe, that if all the nooks and corners of the Peninsula were carefully explored, many more of these upright stones \u2014 the rude memorials of bygone times \u2014 would most probably be discovered. In the foregoing remarks, I have given, what may be termed the \" pitched stone \" theory of the origin of the name Gower \u2014 that an early people, the Cymry, coming to settle here, and finding \u2022 Sir Gardner Wilkinson fortunately made a drawing of one of these stones which will be given in the Notices of the parish of Llanmadoc. f Travellers in some parts of India report that they have seen the natives erecting Cistvacns and Dolmens at the present day, aud describe the process.\u2014 Vide Capt. Meadow Taylor'- Travels in the Decean."], [14, "4 the district abounding in these pillar stones, called it in their language \" Gwyr, or Meini Gwyr \" (the land of the stone men). This theory may be plausible, but I do not think it is the true one, for, as it depends entirely upon the fact of these people finding, the said pillar stones on their arrival, if it should turn out that they were erected subsequently, and by another race, then, according to every well known principle in onomatology, the foregoing theory must be given up. An opinion seems gaining ground that these megalithic struc tures were erected by the Danes, and consequently not older than the ninth or tenth centuries. The antiquity, however, of these curious remains is, I think, a question which has yet to be settled. * Many arch\u00e6ologists, and among them I may mention Sir Gardner Wilkinson, are inclined to assign them to an age long anterior to the coming of the Celt, and that these silent records of pre-historic times carry us very far back into the long, dark, and mysterious period of the unwritten past. We must now pass on to review the other theories which have been put forward to account for the derivation of the name. Places were often called by names descriptive of the physical chiracter of the district; sometimes, as there is good reason for supposing is the case here, from the configuration of the land; and thus while some derive the name from the Welsh adjective Gwyr, meaning luxuriant, or verdant ; others say it comes from Gwyr with the circumflex accent, signifying slanting, lien ding; either of which may be very correctly applied to this Peninsula, whether we consider the general richness and fertility of the soil, or the undulated and varied character which the surface of the country presents to the eye. The former of these two derivations must, I fear, be rejected, as however true it may be with regard to the present nature of the cultivated land, we cannot but suppose, that when the early British settlers came here, and Cunedda and his sons in the fourth century drove out the Irish from Gower and the three Commots, it could have been very little else but tangled forest, barren hill, * The massive and ourious military works constructed of stone on the Island of Arran are attributed to tbe Firbolgs, a dwarfish race of very strong people, supposed to have come from Scythla, and settled in Ireland before the age of Christianity.

The development of its agricultural interests and the production of that corn, of which Camden speaks so favourably, did not take place until many ages after it was known by the name of Gowerland. In the word Gwyr, slanting, oblique, bending, I think we may discover the true origin of the nanio. Dr. Nicholas, in his \"History of Glamorganshire,\" p. 48, makes it a British word of two syllables (Go-hir), far, long, outstretching, very long. This exactly describes the character of the district, and is in fact the special feature of the Peninsula \u2014 a long jutting promontory, or neck of land, measuring in length about twenty miles, and averaging in breadth from five to six. Gower therefore takes its name, hke many other places, from the configuration of the land; and I think we may rest quite satisfied with the explanation of Dr. Nicholas, and accept it, until some one is fortunate enough to meet with a better definition in any ancient author. Gower has been the title of the Peninsula from a very remote period; we have no record of its being known by any other name until the sixth century, when an allusion is made to it under the name of Rheged, in connection with a conquest over the natives of this part ..by Urien, one of King Arthur's knights, who was called in consequence, \" Urien Rheged \" (Urien of the gift). This name, however, was only temporary, and does not seem to have obtained, and there is, moreover, some obscurity about it; for by this title, some understand, the district of Cumberland, over which it would appear that Urien also held sovereign sway. The earliest mention of it that I have as yet met with, is in the account given by Nennius, in the \"Historia Brit.,\" of the driving out of the Irish from Gower and KidweUy by Cunedda * and his sons in the fourth century. After this event, and shortly before the death of this great chieftain, an allusion is made in the Triads to an expedition of the men of Gower into Brittany a.d. 388. After this, we meet with a notice of one Padrig ap Mawon, f of Gower, a.d. 440, mentioned by Colonel Francis in his Chapter on Gower in the Appendix to his \" Swansea Charters.\" * Cunedda flourished A.D. 340-389. t Merchwyn ap Glewys is said to have been Sovereign of Gower in the time of St. Dubritius, Bishop of Llandaff, in the fifth century.\u2014 Vide Lib. Land. Chron. Series of the Bishops o_ Llandaff."], [16, "6 Merely remarking that Gower if? but the English form of the Welsh Gwyr, I would observe, that the names of places are among some of the most conspicuous landmarks of history, and throw the greatest hght upon much that would otherwise be very uncertain and obscure. Sir Richard Colt Hoare in his preface to the \" Itinerary of __ rchbishop Baldwin,\" pertinently remarks, \u2014 \" The name of each individual place, river, mountain, and field, has its significant meaning, and there is nothing which contributes to throw more hght on the ancient history of Cambria than the names of places judiciously investigated, and not too fancifully etymologized.\" It is thus we gain a clue to the original settlers of a country, whence they came, and the language they spoke. Hence from the many purely Welsh words that we find engrafted into the vocabulary of this Peninsula, and unknowingly made use of by the present inhabitants, we have strong presumptive evidence, that a very early people in this country were the ancient British race, a portion of that Celtic stock which colonized Eng land, Ireland, and Scotland, as well as North and South Wales. Such names of places usually outlive the people who bestowed them. The language as a vehicle of oral communication may gradually die away and be forgotten; but the names of mountains, hills, rivers, streams, fountains, towns, villages, places, &c, would remain, bearing silent, but incontrovertible testimony, that they had once been occupied by some particular race of people. It may, perhaps, appear singular to a stranger that the Welsh tongue has so entirely disappeared in Western Gower; but a closer acquaintance with the language of the inhabitants will show, that many traces of it yet remain. The phrase, ach-a-fi, expressive of disgust, may be frequently heard; many articles of household furniture, and articles used for domestic and culinary purposes still retain then- Welsh originals: the hob is invariably called the pentan (head of the fire), mapsant,* mochyr (the haggard), Gwrac f and many others, are purely Welsh words. Next we have the names of villages, rivers, brooks, moors, mountains, farms, farm-houses. In short, there is scarcely one of these which is not now known by its Welsh name. With the exception of Cheriton, T_*fehopston, Oxwich, Nicholaston, and Reynoldston, the names of the remaining villages, such as Pen- \" The annual parish festival kept in honour of the patron saint of the Church. t A custom observed in the corn fields at harvest time, called ' ' binding the Gwrac"], [17, "7 maen, Penard, Penrice, Porteynon, Llandewi, LlaaSmadoc Llan gennith, Penclawdd, Llanrhidian, and Rhosili are unmistakably Welsh. In like manner other places, as Llagadranta, Lethryd, Llanmorlas, Aberlogi, Henllys, Gamlas, Penmynnyd, Tredegar, Park-y- \".edin, Park-y-rodyn, Llwyn-y-bwch, and many more. In fact a very long list of names might be given which would be tedious to read, all of which serves to show, that the early Celtic colonists have left ample evidence of their sojourn in Gower, though their language is no longer that of the present inhabitants. The dialect of Gower is ordinary English,* and though we might not expect to find any very great purity of language amongst the people, it as been remarked, that, as a general rule, they speak very fan- English, entirely free from any accent, or provincialism ; there is therefore as good reason for calling Gower \" Little England beyond Wales,\" as there was for so naming the hundred of Rhos, in Pembrokeshire. According to Camden, \" all the country beyond the river (Nedd) Neath, to the river Loughor, or British Llwchyr, the West boundary of this country, is called by us Gower, and Nennius, Guhir, where that author states the sons of Kainus, the Scot, spread themselves, till driven out by Cunedda, a British King.\" Filii autem Yethan (Scoti) obtinuerunt reg Demectorium ubi civitas est qu\u0153 vocatur Minue (St. David's) et in aliis regionibus se dilataverunt i.e. Guhicr et Cet Gucly, donee expulsi sunt a Cunnedda et afiliis ejus ob omibus regionibus Britannieis. Another edition of this author gives the same passage, with some little variation, as follows : \u2014 \" Filii autem Lethali f ob tinueruut regionem dem\u00e6torum ubi civitas est qu\u0153 vooatur Mineu et alias provintias Guohir et Cetgucli, donee expulsi sunt a C'uneda et afiliis eius ob omnibus regionibus Bryttannicis.\" The sons of Lethalus obtained the country of the Dem\u0153t\u0153, where there is a town called Meneu (St. David's) and other provinces of Gower and Kidweli, until they were driven out from all parts of Britain by Cunedda % and his sons.

It is related in the Historical Triads, that Urien was the first who gave lands and privileges to the Church."], [18, "8 served in Kidwelly, at a place called Alltcynodda, where also there are Tumuli. Leland, quoting from a copy of this author, which, he says, one Thomas Sulmo put into his hand, gives this passage as follows:\u2014 '\" Filii autem Liethan obtinuerunt regionem Dunectorem et in aliis regionibus dilataverunt id est, in Guhir et Cetgueh, donee expulsi sunt a Cuneda, et a filiis ejus, ol omnibus regionibus Britannieis.\u2014 Vide \" Leiand's Coh.\" vol hi., p. 45, Hearne's Ed. By comparing this extract, and what it alludes to, with an elegy composed by Taliesin in the sixth century on the death of Cunedda, we are able to identify the Guiher of Nennius with the Can- Wair of the British bard. \" I, who am Taliesin, a man of the oaks, award the song of praise to the Christian chief, the wor shipper of the Wonderful One. Where cliff meets cliff in the west, was the dread of Cunedda, the ardent in battle, in Caer Wair and Caer Liwelydd.\" Strictly speaking, there is no suth word as Wair, the word is really Gwair, and the expression Caer Gwair, when translated, is the fortress of hay, a meaning at once ridiculous and unintelligible, and one which we imagine the bard never intended to convey. The probability is that the word Wair is by some mistake of a copyist wi'itten for Wyr, and to read the sentence aright (as Taliesin is here evidently alluding to Gower), we should have not Caer Wair, but Caer Wryr, (i.e.) the fortress of Gower, a meaning which is at once plain and to the purpose. That I am right in this conjecture is fully borne out by the circumstance, that in a po em by Lewis Glyn Cothi in the fifteenth century, we meet with the very expression Caer Wyr, used by him in speaking of the town of Swansea, where was formerly a goodly Castle now in ruins, the residence of the Lord of the Seignory. That Taliesin could not have been referring to the town of Swansea alone is evident, as his language describes a Tract of country rather than \u00a3>ne particular part of it. When he says \u2014 \" Where cliff meets cliff in the west is the dread of Cunedda,\" we have a description which answere exactly to the whole Peninsula of Gower\u2014 a narrow strip of land to the extreme west of the county, about twenty miles long, and between five or six broad, in some places even less, with cliffs each side, which, without any very great stretch of the imagination, we may allow the bard the poetical license of making meet."], [19, "9 Tn the \" Liber Landavensis \" Gower is described as one of the seven Cantreds of the Lordship and Bishoprick of Glamorgan. \" Know all christians that there are seven Cantreds in the Lord ship of Glamorgan, and likewise in the Bishoprick of its Church, which is Llandaff. The first is Cantref Bychan ; the second is Cantref Gwyr, Cydweli, and Carnwalhawn ; the third is Cantref Gorfynydd ; the fourth is Cantref Penychen ; the fifth is Cantref Gwaunllwg, and Edelygion ; the sixth is Cantref Gwent-iscoed ; the seventh is Cantref Gwent-uchcoed, and Ystradyw, and Ewyas.\" Percy Enderbie, speaking of the division of Caermarthenshire into Cantreds and Commots, * mentions, \" Cantref Eginoc with these, Gwir,f now in Glamorganshire, Cidwel,| and Carnwillheon.\" It was not until the time of Henry the eighth that Gower was finally incorporated with the County of Glamorgan ; an Act was passed in 1535-6 for the purpose ; in earlier times it formed part of Caermarthenshire, and, as will be seen hereafter, the Lordship frequently changed hands. According to the Triads, the men of Gower were comprehended in the tribe of Pendarran Dyfed || one of the \" three primary tribes of the Island of Britain. This tribe was composed of the men of Dyfed, Gwir, and Caredigion,\u00a7 and to each of them be longed a peculiar dialect of the Welsh.\" From the MSS. of Iolo Morganwg we learn that Gower was part of the territory of Urien Rheged, one of King Arthur's knights, having been given to him by Arthur as a gift (Rheged), for driving the Irish out of that part of the country. \" Three Irish Invasions took place in Cambria, and one family, that of Cunedda Wledig, delivered the country from the three. The first occurred in Gower, in Glamorganshire, where Caian Wyddel and his sons landed, subjugated the country, and ruled it for eight years; but Cunedda Wledig, and Urien, the son of Cynfarch, subdued and slew them to nine, whom they drove into the sea; and the government of the country was conferred upon Urien, the son of Cynfarch, having been con stituted a kingdom for that purpose, and called Rheged, because * According to the laws of Howell Dda, temp. 10th cent., a commot was a district containing twelve manors and two hamlets.

C"], [20, "10 it was bestowed unanimously by its ancient British inhabitants on Urien in free gift, whence he was called Urien Rheged.\" ' According to Iolo, Rheged was a district consisting of Gower, Cydwelli, Carnwyllion, Cantref-bychan, and Iscennen. Urien Rheged, therefore, means Urien of the Gift; having obtained this surname for the cause above mentioned. He flourished in the sixth century, and in Sir Thomas Mallory's edition of the Morte d' Arthur, is frequently alluded to under the title of Sir Urience of Gore. His principal home or residence was at Loughor. Iolo also elsewhere informs us, that Urien was assisted by the children of Cunedda Wledig and the sons of Ceredig,* in expelling the Irish from Gower. As there is some confusion here between the account given by Nennius and Iolo, concerning the conquest of Gower (the former ascribing it to Cunedda, and the .latter to Urien Rheged, assisted by the children of Cunedda), before we proceed to clear away this apparent discrepancy, it will be necessary to quote another version of the matter as recorded in one of the celebrated Hafod MSS. copied by Iolo Morganwg. \" Cunedda Wledig drove the Irish from Gower and the three Commots, for which service the royal government of that country was conferred upon him, and the dominion was called Rhegid; its royal residence being Aberlwchyr, where this Prince erected an amazingly strong and magnificent castle, the ruins of which are still to be found there. Others however assert that it was Urien Rhegid who expelled the Irish from Gower, in the time of Uther Pen- dragon; j and that it was for this service he received the kingly government of that country, which he named Rhegid, and con structed a castle and municipal town at Aberlwchyr, where the royal residence continued for seven generations. After which, the dominion became re-united by marriage to Glamorgan, and continued so to the time of Edgar, King of London, and of Owen, son of Howell the Good, when it was assigned to the latter Prince; Ewais, Ergynge, and Ystrad Yw, being at the same time awarded to Morgan the Aged, King of Glamorgan; those districts being in the See of the Bishop of Glamorgan and Llandaff; but Rhegid * Cunedda had a son called Ceredig. t Parry in his Cambrian Plutarch says, that strictly speaking it was Arthur's father, Meurig, who was surnamed Uther Pendragon, (i.e.) the wonderful Supreme Ruler. Pen dragon has no reference as Camden and others think, either to the serpentine subtilty of that chief, or to the emblem borne on his banner"], [21, "11 was in that of St. David's. In process of time Sir William de Londres regained the three Commots, namely, Kidweli, Carn wyllion, and Iscennen, from the Princes of Dinevor, and re-united them to Glamorgan; in which state they continued until the time of Henry V., when Rhegid was again restored to Ystrad-Twy, of which they formed constituent parts in the periods of the Princes of Dinevor. It was at this re-union that the whole district so constituted was named Caermarthenshire, and it has been known as such until our own times, when Wales was arranged under new divisions, under which Gower* was attached to Cardiffshire, called Glamorganshire.\" In these somewhat contradictory statements, namely, that of Nennius and the Hafod MS., a difficulty presents itself, very similar to that which we find occurring some centuries later, in the accounts given by Powell and Dugdale as to the subjugation of Gower by Bernard Newmarch and Henry de Newburgh. The difficulty in this latter case is, however, easily explained, as the two Barons were contemporaries ; while in the case ,of Cunedda and Urien Rheged, there was an interval of some two hundred years, more or less, between them. The narratives are too distinct to suppose that any serious blunder has been committed in the accounts given. Taliesin, the bard, and Nennius, the historian, agree in imputing an early conquest of Gower to Cunedda Wledig, while the Hafod MS. authority states, that the Irishmen in these parts were driven out by Urien Rheged, about 200 years after Cunedda's time. One very simple and easy way of reconciling this apparent variation, suggests itself, by supposing two separate irruptions of the Irish, and expulsions of them by the chiefs referred to \u2014 a circumstance by no means unlikely, when we consider the prox imity ofthe two coasts, the marauding character of the then Irish, and the wild, stormy, and unsettled state of the times.f We have also to remember \" that the centuries during which these events are supposed to have occurred, constituted pre-eminently the age * From this statement it would appear that Gower has passed from Carmarthenshire into Glamorgan, and back again, a great many times. A circumstance which will be sufficient to account for the dispute which took place between Bernard. Bishop of St. David's, and Urban, Bishop of Llandaff, in the J2th century, concerning Episcopal jurisdiction. t Vide \"Vestiges of the Gael\" by Dr. Basil J..nes, Bishop gf St. David's, p. 44"], [22, "12 of migrations.\" We have, moreover, to recollect that between their defeat by Cunedda Wledig, and that by Urien Rheged, an interval of 200 years had elapsed, during which 4\u00b1___l the Irish had sufficient time to recover the blow, and would be disposed to make another effort to regain the country from which they had been driven out. It has been supposed with some degree of probability, that these Irish, who are identical with the Gwyddel, or Gael, were the first Celtic inhabitants of Britain, and preceded the Cymry, who dispossessed them. But, as Dr. Basil Jones, Bishop of St. David's, says, * \u2014 \" The question whether the Celts had predecessors in these islands is a highly difficult one; but the solution is possibly not beyond the power of arch\u00e6ological science.\" From the state ments of Nennius, Taliesin, the bard, and what we find in the Hafod MS., quoted by Iolo, about the Irishmen, or Gwyddel, the question will arise \u2014 \" Did the Gael, or Gwyddel,' temporarily dis possess the Cymry; or did the Cymry for the first and last time, dispossess the Gael of a country which they themselves had never before inhabited ? \" Thierry, in his \" History of the Norman Conquest,\" speaks thus on the point : \u2014 \" The Cambrian nation boasted of the higher antiquity. They had come in a body from the eastern extremities of Europe, across the -German Ocean. One part of the emigrants had landed on the coast of Gaul, the other had chosen the opposite shore of the Strait, and colonized Britain, which, says the Cambrian traditions, j\" had until then, no other inhabitants than bears and wild cattle; and where, consequently, the new colonists estabhshed themselves without opposition, without warfare, and without violence, as the first occupiers of the soil.\" But, as Thierry proceeds to remark, \u2014 \" This honourable pretension can hardly be historically supported. It is most probable that the Cambrian emigrants found in the Island of Britain men of another origin, and a different language, whose lands they invaded. This is attested by many names of places foreign to the Cambrian tongue, as well as by ruins J of an unknown age, attributed by the vulgar tradition to an extinct race of hunters, who, instead of dogs, trained foxes .and wild cats Vide ' ' Vestiges of the Gael\" p. 48. . Trioedd ynys Prydaia. No. 1, \" Arch\u00e6ology of Wales,\" vol. ii., p. 57. I These are the ruins now called in Welsh Cyttiau'r y G wyddelod (Irishman's houses) : but Gwyddel also means a man of the wood."], [23, "13 to the chase.* This primitive population of Britain was gradually forced upon the west and north by the successive invasions of strangers who landed in the east.\" Thierry's opinion, therefore, seems to be, that the Cambrian emigrants found an earlier people settled in Britain before them, and that these were the Gael, or Gwyddel. The conquest of these people in the west, that is in Gower, by Cunedda and his sons, the present Bishop of St. David's is disposed to look upon as the result of the pushing on of what he would rather call the \" Cuneddian migration,\" than the leading of an armed force against the people by this chief. I must now return to a circumstance mentioned in the Hafod MS., which requires some explanation. It begins by stating that Cunedda Wledig gave the name of Rheged to Gower and the three Commots, while further on it informs us, that it was the opinion of some that Urien gave it this name. There is evidently a mistake here. It is quite clear that one or other of them must have given it this name. The probability is, that Cunedda, the first in the field, gave it the name, and that his successor, who was only plain Urien before, was now sur named, in consequence of his conquest, Urien \"Rheged (Urien of the Gift), after the place which was already so called. Instances of this kind were very common, and we have many examples of persons being called by way of distinction, from the places were they lived or had been brought up. In the \" Canibro Briton,\" vol. ii., p. 243, another explanation is given as to how the title of Rheged came to be applied to Gower. \" Urien Rheged has been celebrated by many bards, more particularly by Taliesin, who dedicates several of his odes to him. His original patrimony was in Cumberland, which he yielded to the growing power of the Saxons, and sought refuge with the chieftain of Morganwg in South Wales, where he had lands given him, on which he bestowed the name of Rhegid, being that of his lost possession. Towards the close of his life he became an inmate of Catwg's College, at Llancarvan, the general resort of the expatriated chiefs of Cambria, during the fifth and sixth centuries. Urien fell by the hand of Llovan Llawdino, who is therefore styled in the Triads one of the three atrocious assassins. According to Llywarch He n, who wrote an \u00bb \" Hor\u0153 B-ittanic\u00e6,\" vol. i., p. 81."], [24, "14 elegy on the death of Urien, it was by decapitation that Llovan completed this' foul deed. It would seem, from the following lines of the bard, that there was a hue and cry after the murderer. \" There is a commotion through all the country, In search of Llovan with the destroying hand.\" In the Triads Urien is styled one of the three balls of conflict of the Island of Britain. \" The three bulls of conflict of the Isle of Britain \u2014 Cynvar Cadgadog, the son of Cynwyd Cynwydion, and Gwenddolan. ap Ceidio, and Urien, the son of Cynfarch ; that is, they were wont to rush on their foes like a bull, and it was not possible to avoid them.'' The arms of Urien Rheged were, in later times, quoted as Arg. a Chevron between three ravens sable. There is an allusion to the ravens of Owen ap Urien Rheged, in the \" Dream of Rhonabwy and the Lady ofthe Fountain,\" in the \" Mabinogion,\" translated by Lady Charlotte Guest. From the latter end of the fourth, to the middle of the sixth century, or we might say, from the death of Cunedda Wledeg, in a.d. 389, to that of King Arthur in 542, we have a period of one hundred and fifty three years, during which period, or at least that part of it which was comprehended under the rule of that brave and pious * monarch \u2014 the ferocious Irish having been driven out the second time by Urien Rheged \u2014 we may fairly suppose that Gower enjoyed a season of comparative peace and prosperity. And as it is at such times that the interests of religion are chiefly promoted, and the cause of the Church en- gages the attention of men, so it happened now, for it was just about this period that the ecclesiastical history of Gower may be said to begin, and those great and saintly men, SS. David, Cynnyd, Madoc, and Utyd, appear on the scene, converting the pagan inhabitants, and founding the Churches of Llandewi, Llan- genneth, Llanmadoc, liston, and many others. We may reason- ably suppose, in the absence of any notices to the contrary, that up to the year 836, the time when the Danes first appeared on the Welsh coasts \u2014 the Land of Gower was in a state of tolerable tranquility, and that by the zeal and pious care of the successors of those great Christian Missionaries, the true faith flourished in * Eoger of Wendover, in his \" Flowers of History,\" tells us that Arthur bore the device of the B.V.-M. on his shield \"Pridwen,\" and that he was in the habit of invokmg her name in battle."], [25, "15 /46s. the district. Its history now begins to be surrounded with the greatest possible interest, coming before us, as it does, at a time when the glory and power of Wales was at its zenith, the age of chivalry and romance, and having as a resident in this remote corner of it the celebrated Urien Rheged, one of the most famous of King Arthur's knights, who with his treacherous wife, Morgan le Fay, doubtless entertained the renowned Peredur * and others, on that wonderful journey through the world in search of the \" Cauldron of Inspiration,\" and the \" Symbolic Lance \" \u2014 those mysterious objects, which, in the hands of the Christian romancers of the middle ages, became the Sangraal, or Holy Chalice, tised by our Lord at the Institution of the Eucharist, and the spear which pierced His side \u2014 that wonderful journey which has lately been immortalised in a beautiful poem by Tenn)-son, and called the \" Quest of the Holy Grail.\" We must now pass on to a very disturbed and dismal period in the history of Gower \u2014 the landing of the Danes on the coast \u2014 those fierce invaders, who, for a while, swept everything before them \u2014 the Churches were plundered and burnt to ashes, religion was almost lost sight of, an,d the sword, famine, and pestilence, fell upon the wretched inhabitants in quick succession. * Called in the Triads one of the three Virgin Knights who obtained a sight of the ' Holy Graal.\" In the \"Morte d' Arthur,\" Sir Thomas Mallory's Ed., A D. _*t34; pub lished by Thomas Wright, M.A., F.S.A., three Knights are mentioned who go to seek the \" Holy Graal,\" Sir Perceval, Sir Bors, aud Sir Galahad\u2014 the latter, a pure and spotless knight, achieves the quest."], [26, "CHAPTER II. THE OCCUPATION OF GOWER BY THE DANES.' As far as I have yet been able to learn there is very little direct historical testimony extant on this subject; but if there had been none at all, so much evidence of a local and traditionary character can be brought forward, that there can be no doubt whatever that the Danes once conquered and occupied Gower. \" In or about the year 836 the Danes landed in West Wales,* and so passing through Wales into England with many of the Britains, which joyned with them against Egbert, but they were all overthrown by Egbert at Hengistdown.\" In 871 we have, in the same author, an account of a sanguinary engagement which took place at Loughor, between\" the Danes and the King of Caredigion, when the latter was drowned in the river. Six years later (877) in the Manual of Dates we are informed that 120 Danish vessels were wrecked in Swansea Bay. This event is also mentioned in an old MS. of an anonymous author, transcribed by Thomas Hearne, M.A., the antiquary, a.d. 1722, and published by him together with \" Peter Langtoft's Chronicle.\" Speaking of several Danish invasions, he says, \u2014 \" A 7th invasion, intended against the mari time coasts, but by the hand of God confounded before they could come quite thither (like that of the Spaniards in 88) thus. The Deanes having a great fleet and armie at Wereham in Dor setshire, designed their armie in those parts by land, and a fleet of 120 saile here to meet them. So the fleet saihng round by Cornwell, came to anchor apud Swaniwick,f which I take to be now Swanesey, on the north coasts, over against the West of \u2022 Vide \"Camb. Triumpbans,\" p. 207.

But then it pleased the Lord to send such a violent and sudden tempest upon them as destroyed them all: so that, as Ovid saith of the sea where Icarus was drowned, 'Icarus Icariis nomina dedit aquisf \" So may I say of King Swanus his fleet, drowned at Swanawick, alias Swanesey, (i.e. Swanus-sea,) ' Swanus Sanewicis nomina dedit aquis, Swanus to Sane-Sea leasers gave their name. Percy Enderbie, quoting David Powell, sol. 34, says, \u2014 \" I find also (saith my Author) that about this time (a.d. 873) Halden and Hungare, two Captains of the Danes arrived in South Wales, and over-run the whole country, destroying all before them, with fire and sword, neither sparing Churches or religious houses ; but within a while after they received their deserved reward at the hands of the West Saxons, who, awaiting them on the coaste of Devonshire, slew both Halden and Hungare, with 1,200 of their people.\" \" In the year 987, Edwin ap Eineon procured an army of English and Danes, and destroyed all the land of Cardigan, Dyfed, Gower, Cydwely, and St. David's ; and obliging the inhabitants to own him as lawful sovereign, received hostages for that pur pose.* This attack of Edwin was to revenge himself upon Meredyth ap Owen, who had usurped the sovereignty of South Wales against the right of Edwin ap Eineon, who was the lawful heir.\" The date 886 above mentioned, corresponds to the time of the celebrated King, Regner Lodbrog,f who flourished in Den mark in the beginning of the ninth century. He was a great warrior, and after many memorable battles in various countries, was at last taken prisoner by Ella, King of Northumberland, and thrown into a dungeon to be stung to death by serpents. In a poem called the \" Dying Ode of Regner,\" published by Malet in his \" Northern Antiquities,\" the scald of the King is supposed to record his valiant achievements. \"We fought- with swords at Boring-holmi. We held bloody shields: we stained our spears. Showers of arrows brake the shield in pieces. The bow sent forth the glittering steel. Volnir * Vide Meyrick's \" History of Cardiganshire.\" t Lodbrog signifies, the rough or hairy breeches. D"], [28, "18 fell in the conflict, than whom was not a greater King. Wide on the shores lay the scattered dead : the wolves rejoiced over their prey.\" Immediately after this comes the following stanza: \u2014 \" We fought with swords in the Fleming's land ; the battle widely raged before King Freyer fell therein. The blue steel all reeking with blood, fell at length upon the golden mail. Many a virgin bewailed the slaughter of that morning. The beasts of prey had ample spoil.\" From the account which the poet gives of these battles, and the places where they were fought \u2014 if I am right in my conjec ture as to the identity of these places \u2014 we may infer, that in the ninth century, the Danes, in formidable numbers,* apjieared on the Gower coast. Boring Hohni is evidently the island now called Burry Holms, Holm being the Scandinavian name for island. The mention of the battle in the \" Fleming's land \" is somewhat start ling, inasmuch as the date of the Flemish settlement here was at least two hundred years after the time of Regner Lodbrog. The only way of accounting for this anachronism, is by supposing the poem to have been written long after the death of Regner, and when the Flemings had settled themselves hi these parts ; but the poet not being aware that these were a new people, imagines them to have been here in the days of Regner. It is, however, not quite clear that the Peninsula of Gower is intended in the par ticular stanza recording this battle in the \" Fleming's land \" \u2014 which probably took place somewhere on the shores of Milford Haven, near the village called Freystrop t (Freysthorpe) (i.e.) Freyer's viUage, where, we may suppose, King Freyer fell, hence the name. \" We fought with swords in the Flemings' land ; the battle widely raged before King Freyer fell therein.\" Pembroke, Milford, Haverfordwest, Laugharne, and Rhos, received a numerous colony of Flemings in the time of Henry the First, and consequently might well be termed the \" Fleming's land.\" The identity of these people with the present inhabitants of Gower will be shown hereafter. * Probably not the first invasion, as the custom of these Vikings was to send small parties first, which were followed by larger bodies. These again did not feel them. selves in the least degree bound by any compacts made by their predecessors with the inhabitants, who were often betrayed in this way. t Frey-sthorpe, Danish ; meaning Freyer's village."], [29, "19 The battle of Boring Hohni is plain enough ; and! if names mean anything, the identity of Boring Holmi and Burry Holms is fully established. It would, indeed, be a surprising circum stance, if the Danes, who appear to have been fighting all round the place, from Lundy Island, along the coast of Pembrokeshire and the shores of Milford Haven, should not have visited the west coast of Gower. There is a deep trench on the Burry Holms, running from one side of the island to the other, completely cutting off all communication with the main land. I should mention that this place is only an island when the tide is in. To guard against a surprise at low water, the ditch would be absolutely necessary, while the steep cliffs, 100 feet high, with the deep sea washing around its south-western extremity, would be a sufficient pro tection on that quarter. The rocky promontory caUed \" Nottle Tor,\" in Cheriton Parish, is fortified in a similar way, and so are many of the headlands along the coast. While engaged in writing this chapter on the Occupation of Gower by the Danes, I met with the Rev. Isaac Taylor's book on \" Words and Places,\" and was much pleased to find that his theory quite coincided with my own. In page 117, of the fourth edition of his work, he makes the following remarks : \u2014 \" The sea rovers, with infallible instinct, seem to have detected the best harbours in the kingdom, and to have found shelter for their vessels in the fjords of the Pembrokeshire coast \u2014 the deep, land bound channels of Milford Haven, Haverford,* Whiteford, f and Skerryford, and the neighbouring creeks of Wathwick, Little Wick, Oxwich, Helwick, Gellyswick, Mouselwick, Wick Haven, and Muggleswick Bay. The dangerous rocks and islands which fringe this coast, likewise bear Norwegian names, such as the Stack Rocks, Stackpole Head, The Stack, Pennyholt Stack, St. Bride's Stack, Stack Island, Stockholm Island, Skerryback, Sker point, the Naze, Strumble Head, the Worms Head, J Nash (Naze) Point, and Dungeness (Dangerness). Most of the names on the main land are Celtic, but the neighbouring islands bear the Norse * As if Havenfjord : there is a Hafnafjord in Iceland. t Whiteford sands show that the estuary of the Bun-y must have received from the Norsemen the appropriate name of Hvit-fjord. } From the Norse, Orme a serpent. The Wormshead is the Saxonized form of the same word."], [30, "20 names of Caldy, (cold island), Barry (bare island), Sully (ploughed island), Lundy (grove island), or Puffin Island, from Norse Lundi, a Puffin, Stockholm (wooded island), Denney (Danes island), Ram sey, Skomer, Burry Holms, Gateholm, Flathohn, and Steepholm. No less than twenty-four headlands on the Pembrokeshire coast were occupied by camps, which we may regard as the first beginning of a Scandinavian occupation of the soil. Round the shores of Milford Haven, a little colony of permanent settlers was estabhshed, in the villages of Freystrop (Freysthorpe), Studda, Yogar, Angle, Tenby * (Daneby), Derby, Hasguard, Fishguard, Dale, Lambeth, and Whitsand. Of the Vikings who founded this colony, Harold, Bakki, Hamill, Grim, Hiarn, Lambi, Thorni, Thor, Gorm, Broder, Solvar, Hogni, and Buthir, have left us their names at Haroldston, Buckston, Ambleston, Creamston, Hearston, Lambston, Thornton, Thurston, Gomfreston, Brother HiD, Silver HiU, Honey HiU, and Butter HUI, several of which may be the burial places of those whose names they bear.\" In the foregoing extract, copied by permission, from Mr. Taylor's work, we have a group of Danish names of places, numerous enough to show an extensive occupation in West Wales. Some of these names, as Oxwich, Helwick, Wormshead, Whitford, and Burry Holms, are names of places on the Gower coast ; and this hst I shall now proceed to enlarge by the addi tion of many others, in order to establish as fully as possible my statement of a Danish occupation of the Peninsula; and more especiaUy that part of it comprised within the parishes of Rhosili, Llangennith, and Llanmadoc. Traces of these people are to be found in Llanrhidian, Oxwich, and Penrice, and will be men tioned in the notices of those parishes. There is a tradition in Rhosili, that three Danish vessels came to the Burry Holms, and that the crews landed and proceeded to Llangennith, where they burned the Church, and slaughtered the people ; but while they were occupied in this murderous work, the inhabitants of Rhosili went to the sands and set fire to the ships. This story was communicated to me by Lady Wilkinson, who had it from an old man in Rhosih village. On the top of Llanmadoc hiU there is a circular camp, caUed the \" Bulwark,\" defended by several deep trenches. Mr. Matthew* * In Wrelsh, Dinbych y pysgod."], [31, "21 Moggridge, F.G.S., was perhaps the first to attribute this military work to the Danes ; he has also given a plan of the fortification ; but not being so weU acquainted with the locality as myself, he has not, so far as I am aware, advanced anything further in sup port of his statement. To the south of Llanmadoc Hill, and separated from it by the intervening plain, called \" Tankey Lake Moor,\" is Harden's Down, more commonly termed \" Arsin Down.\" On this Down, there are distinct traces of two separate camp3, one on the crest, and another on the north side. I- should here observe that the latter is circular, and inferior in size to the other, and so unlike it in every way, that it suggests a doubt as to its being of the same date, or thrown up by the same people. The inhabitants hereabouts give an account of a desperate fight which took place between the people on Llanmadoc HiU, and those on Harding's Down. I give it verbatim as related by Henry Thomas, of Llagadranta. \" There was a bloody battle between the people on Llanmadoc Hill, and them on Arsin Down ; they slung stones and pitched bow arras * at one another from hill to hill for a long time, and then they met and fought hand to hand on Tankey Lake, tiU the blood was up to the tops of their boots : here Tankin, the leader on one side, was kiUed, and the place was caUed ever after, Tankey's Lake.\" My informant also told me, that the leader on the other side was \"one Captain Hardy\"; \"Captain Tonkin was,\" he said, \" a Frenchman, but he had never heard of what nation Captain Hardy was.\" It would appear from this local tradition, which in the main is doubtless true enough, that these two camps were antagonistic, and occupied at the same time by beUigerents of two different nations. The name Hardy, Harding, or Arsin, has so much of the Danish ring about it, that I think there can be httle doubt as to his nationality ; and after him we may suppose the place was caUed \" Harding's Down.\" Tonkin, therefore, must have been the commander of the garrison within the work on Llanmadoc HiU, which, after the fight which ended so disastrously for him, * This expression \" bow arras \" is almost universal among the country people when speaking of the bows and arrows of former times. The professional story-teller in Patrick Kennedy's Actions of the Irish Celts, invariably makes use of the same form of speech."], [32, "22 would naturally be taken possession of by Harding and his vic torious warriors, and I assume that after this occupation it was called the \" Bulwark \"\u2014a name which, though very similar in nearly all the continental languages, is in this case, I believe, the Danish Boll-werke f (a circular work). The Bullwark is the name which the camp on this hiU is always known by. In some documents of no great antiquity, it is sometimes caUed the \" Old Fort \" : and is so described in a. survey of the Manor of Llandimor, taken in the fortieth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In a copy of the \" Boundaries of the Parish of Cheriton \" in my possession, dated 1717, it is styled the \" Bulwarks.\" I never heard the people who hve in the neighbourhood speak of it under any other name, except one old woman who called it the \" Bullrocks.\" It is unusual to find these mihtary works caUed Bulwarks ; there are camps so caUed, elsewhere, I do not deny, there is one at Brecon, but they are not common. Camps are found, but they are generaUy known by their Welsh distinctions, Here we have a stronghold in Wales, known from time immemorial as the \" BuUwark,\" and yet surrounded on aU sides by hills, viUages, streams, and other places, retaining their ancient Welsh names. The promontory of land known as the \" Burry Holms,\" and which forms one of the horns of Rhosili Bay, is sometimes caUed by the country people, the \" Holms Island,\" an expression con sisting of two synonymous terms; for as Holme is the Norse for an island, it is of course unnecessary to say, the Holms Island. Many names of places have been rendered very perplexing in this way, when the original appeUation and its Enghsh equivalent have been used to describe the same place. On the north side of Rhosih Down, there exist some very curious remains, caUed the \" Swine House.\" They consist, in fact, of two large sized Dolmens, and are composed of several flat stones set on their edges, and roofed in the usual way, with a capstone, which in one case has dropped down on end, having probably been disturbed since its erection. The easternmost of these two Dolmens has been entirely thrown down ; the lar\u00b0e flat stones of which it was once composed lying in a confused t In French, Boulevart; Italian, Bolevardo; Spanish, Bulwarts; German and Danish, Boll-werlte, as if from Boll, a globe and work Oiy. a circular work)."], [33, "23 manner. The adjoining one, with the exception of the capstone, is tolerably perfect. It would appear from the quantity of small stones scattered about, as if these Cistvaens had once been covered with a cairn ; but perhaps this may be doubted. I was always of the opinion that the name \" Swine House,\" was only a corruption of Sweyn's * House, that is the house of Sweyn, a thoroughly Danish name. My idea has been confirmed by the late Sir Gardner Wilkinson, who visited these remains, and came to the same conclusion before I had spoken to him on the subject. As these Dolmens f may now be pronounced to be invariably sepulchral, we have here the rare instance of one of these ancient tombs perpetuating the name of the wrarrior who was buried hero nearly a thousand years ago. The name of Sweyn was a great one in olden time, and those who bore it, history informs us, were among some of the most formidable of the Scandinavian chiefs. Here, on the side of Rhosili Down one of them was in terred, after the fashion of his people ; whom Ledwich states \u2014 but I think erroneously \u2014 to have been those who introduced this peculiar practice into the country, and left the most durable memorials of their work behind them. Traces of the Northmen- are to be found in Llanrhidian, Penrice, and Oxwich. The latter name is composed of two synonymous terms, the one \"Celtic and the other Danish, which rendered into English would be well expressed by the term Bays water. The Welsh word Ax, means water, and wick being the Danish for a creek. The Vikings, as the Danish rovers were often caUed, is\" a word meaning the Creekers \u2014 from their custom of frequenting the creeks and bays along the coast, most com modious for them to anchor their ships. \"Names composed like the above are often met with, as for instance, the Isle of Axholme, or Axelhome, in Lincolnshire. Here we have a name composed of nearly four synonymous words. The first syllable Ax is the Celtic word for the water by which it was surrounded. The Anglo Saxons added their word for island to to the Celtic name, and caUed it Axey. A neighbouring viUage \u2022 About the year 980 Sweyn and Olave, two Danish princes, led their forces into Britain : there were many of this name. According to Ledwich, Ferguson, and others, it was the Danes who introduced these Dolmen shaped tombs into this country. t The Dolmen called \" Kits Cotty House \" in Kent, is a similar example, where the name of the Celtic hero Catigern is preserved"], [34, "24 still goes by the name of Haxey. The Danes added Holm, the Danish word for island, to the Celtic name, and modern English influences have corrupted Axeyholme into Axelholme, and con tracted it into Axholme, and have finaUy prefixed the Enghsh word Isle.\" * In the name Wan-s-beck- water j we have another curious agglomeration of words. The first syUable Wan, is a corrupted form of the Welsh Afon, a river. The s is probably a vestige of the Gadhehc uisge, water. The Teutonic Beck, water, was added by the Anglian colonists, and the English word water was suffixed when the meaning of Wansbeck had become obscure ; and Wans beck water, or river water river water, is the extraordinary result. The word Wick is both Saxon and Danish. To distinguish between them, the Saxon Wick wiU be found inland, while the Danish Wick will be confined to the sea coast. This rale holds good with regard to the Celtic and Danish names, the latter, with very few exceptions, are found restricted to the rocks, bays, sands, and sea coast, while further inland we meet with the older Welsh names. But the Peninsula of Gower, from its position and configura tion, has scarcely any interior, and the Danes, having once set foot on it would soon over-run the whole district, and we might consequently expect to find traces of them in many places, besides those where, as I have already shown, they seem to have especiaUy located themselves. At the back of Penrice viUage, and not far from the Church, there is a high mound, partly artificial, and generaUy believed to be a Danish wrork. At a distance it looks like a huge tumulus, but on closer inspection its military character is at once apparent. The supposition of its being thrown up by the Danes is based on the nature and form of the work, and is further confirmed by the fact, that not far off there' is a field which goes by the name of the \" Dunton,\" (i.e.) the Dane town. In Llanrhidian parish there is a house and its premises caUed \" Stafal Hagar.\" At first I imagined that this was a Welsh name, and asked the vicar, the Rev. Geo. Rees, a good Welsh scholar what he thought of it, and if he could make it out as a Welsh * Vide I. Taylor's \" Words and Places,\" 4th Edition, p. 241. t Vide the same Work, p. 141, et passim."], [35, "25 word. He said he could not, and that the name fairly puzzled him. With all due deference to any other Welshman who may be able to identify this word, I venture to caU it Danish. Haugr, is the Danish for a sepulchral mound, and Stafal is pro bably the corruption of some proper name. Thus again, if I am right in my conjecture, we hate the memorial of another Viking who was buried here. Hara Dara, the name of a piece of ground in the same parish, is much more perplexing. It is certainly neither Welsh nor English ; and further than that it sounds like the Danish tongue, I can give no solution as to its meaning. But before we take leave of this curious name, it must be mentioned that \" Hara Dara \" separates \"Croft's Lady\" from \"Sigmond's Hill.\" * This word \" Sigmond,\" is evidently a proper name, and may possibly have some connection with the Danish Chief, Igmond, the Captain of those Black Nations, who in the year a.d. 900, came to the Island of Anglesea, and fought with the Welsh. Vide \" Cambria Triumphans,\" p.' 283. The Danes having now, about the 10th century, got on somej thing like a friendly footing with the Welsh, and becoming gradually Christianized, began to make some atonement for their former evil deeds, and rebuilt and restored many of the Churches burned and destroyed by their Pagan ancestors. But alas ! this did not restore peace to the Welshmen, who had no sooner made friends with their enemies, than they began to sight furiously among themselves, and Gower became again the scene of many a sanguinary battle* It would appear from the \" Liber Llandavonsis,\" that during the Episcopate of Libiau, Bishop of Llandaff, who only occupied the See two years, and died A.D/ 929, that Gruffydd ap Owain was a king who had dominion in Gower at that time. Vide \" Liber Lland. Chron.\" series of the Bishops of Llandaff. In a.d. 958, the Welsh Annals relate that Owen ap Howell Dda, Prince of South Wales, entered and laid Gower waste. \" At this time Morgan Hen was Prince of Glamorgan, and having made known his grievances to Edgar, f King of London, \u2022 Called Sick-man Hill, temp. Queen Elizabeth. Vide Survey of Landymor Manor In the Notices of Cheriton Parish. f This was the Edgar who put the Welsh to an annual tribute of 300 wolves heads, which tax the British Chronicles tell us was paid for 540 years, that is as long as any wolf could be found in all the British Isles. E"], [36, "26 the two princes were summoned before him. Owen was con demned for acting wrongfully to Morgan, and commanded to restore to him aU he had plundered. At the same time Edgar confirmed to Morgan his right over these counties by a solemn covenant made upon the Altar of Teilo at Llandaff, put ting the same in writing, and pronouncing the curse of God and the Saints against whoever should violate the sacredness of the right so named.\" Vide Iolo MSS. * \"In 967 Eineon, the son of Owen ap HoweU Dda, won and seized to himself the land of Gower, and completely devastated it, under pretence of routing the infidels. It was at this time that Owen ap Morgan marched against him, put him to flight, and made aU the men of Gwyr do homage unto himself.\" Vide \" British Chronicles.\" In 976, this same Eineon, nothing daunted by his former reverses, again tried the fortune of war in Gower, which he in vaded and laid waste the second time. He was slain in the year 982 in an insurrection of the men of Gwent. He is said to have been a worthy and notable personage, who did many memorable acts in his father's time. He left two sons behind him, Edwin and Theodore, or Tudor Mawr, of whom came afterwards the Kings and Princes of Wales. Vide in Percy Enderbie's \" Cambria Triumphans,\" p. 239. In the year 990 * Gower suffered very severely in the feud that took place between Edwin, the son of Eineon, and his uncle Meredith, the King of N. and S. Wales. Properly speaking, Meredith had no claim to the sovereignty of South Wales as it belonged to Edwin and Tewdwr, his brother Eineon's sons. But in those days these chieftains did not trouble themselves very much about the legality of their claims. We now come to that period in the History of Gower which leads us to the great irruption of the Normans. * Vide Brnt-y-Tywysogion, 1SC0 Ed., p. 25."], [37, ""], [38, "PEDIGREE William de Braos: Philip de Braose=Annora, d. of I i I William de Braose=Bertha, d. of Milo, Philip de Bra 1st Lord of Gower Earl of Hereford. of this name.

THE CONQUEST OF GOWEE BY THE NORMANS. There is some little confusion in the accounts given us respect ing the Conquest of Gower by the Normans. Jones, in his \" History of Breconshire,\" ascribes it to Bernard Newmarch and Roger de Newburg conjointly, for he says, \" That very early in the twelfth century, or shortly after the insurrection of the men of Brecon, on the death of Wm. Fitzbaldwin, Bernard Newmarch, assisted by Roger de Newburgh, turned his arms against the inhabitants of Gower, to punish them for aiding the men of Brecon,* and being successful, bestowed upon his confederate some territorial possessions and mesne Lordships there.\" It wrould appear from this, that Gower was invaded, a little sooner than it otherwise might have been, in consequence of the inhabitants going to assist the men of Brecon in an insurrection against Bernard Newmarch, who had lately conquered that coun try. The attempt was successful, but was of a very temporary nature, for the Normans soon recovered their lost ground, and it was to punish the Gower men for assisting their countrymen in Brecon that induced Bernard Newmarch to turn his attention to this place. This insurrection of the men of Gwent, Brecon, and Gower took place in 1094, upon the death of Wm. Fitzbaldwin, whose name was a great terror to the Welsh. Powell tells us that Henry de Newburgh conquered Gower. So also Iolo Morganwg, who writes as foUows : \u2014 \"a.d. 1099 Harry Beaumont invaded Gower, and took it from the sons of Caradoc ap Jestyn,t and he built the castle of Swansea.\" Camden says the same. \" In the reign of King Henry the First, Henry, Earl of Warwick, subdued the country of Gower, * At its northern termination, the Lordship of Gower abuts on Breconshire. t Tradition states that one of these sous, Rhys ap Caradoc ap Jestyn, while defend. ing his territories in Gower from the attacks of the Normans, was slain at the village called after him, Penrbys, now Penrice. The battle was fought somewhere at the foot of Cefn Bryn. Penrice Castle itself was built during the Edwardian period, but some portions of it are thought to be of earlier date."], [42, "28 which afterwards, by agreement between Thomas, Earl of War wick, and King Henry the Second, passed to the Crown. King John eventually bestowed it upon William de Breos, to be held \" by the service of one knight for aU service \" : and his successors severally so held it 'till the death of Edward the Second, for at that time, WiUiam de Breos having sold it to several persons, that he might ingratiate himself with the King, deluded aU others, and put Hugh Spencer in possession of it ; this was one of the chief reasons why the nobles became so exasperated against the Spencers, and so unadvisedly quitted their allegiance to the King. It is now divided into East and West Gower.\" Thus fur Camden agrees with PoweU and Iolo Morganwg. Dugdale, however, ascribes the conquest to Roger de New burgh, and in his notice of the Priory of Llangennith says, \"Roger de BeUemont, Earl of Warwick, is said to have conquered Gower land in Wales, and to have thereupon founded a Priory here in the reign of King Stephen,\" As there is some variation in the foregoing accounts of the Conquest of Gower by the families of Newmarch and Newburgh, the probability is that both these Barons conjointly, as Jones thinks, conquered Gowerland, and that Bernard Newmarch, out of gratitude to his coadjutor for helping him when he was so hard pressed in Brecon, conferred upon him part of the subjugated country, reserving to himself the supreme jurisdiction over all. After the death of Bernard Newmarch, his son, Mahel, who should have succeeded to the title and estates of his father, was disinherited by the vengeance of his wicked and unnatural mother, who enraged against him for his detection of a shameful intrigue carried on by her with a certain knight, whose name is unknown, swore before Henry the First, King of England, that Mahel was not the son of her husband, Bernard Newmarch, and by this means being declared legitimate, his inheritance devolved upon Milo Fitzwalter,* who had married Sibil, Mahel's sister. Milo Fitzwalter di?d in 1144, being accidentahy shot through the heart with an arrow, while hunting. He left behind him several sons and daughters, ope of whom, Bertha, t according to Enderbie, married Philip de Breos, who, in her right, was created by King Stephen \"Lord Bruse of Gower, Bould (sic.) and Brember.\" This * Earl of Hereford. t Vide \" Cambria Triumphans,\" p. 252."], [43, "29 however, is a mistake, for Philip did not marry Bertha Fitzwalter, but Annora, d. of It was Philip's son, WiUiam de Braose, who married Bertha, and was created first Lord of Gower of this name, by Charter * of 4th King John, a.d. 1202-3. It seems that this William was a great tyrant ; and after committing many cruel and treacherous acts towards his Welsh subjects, who complained to the King, he fell into disgrace with his sovereign, and was banished the realm by King John. After being reduced to great extremities by poverty and hunger, he died in France a.d. 1212. Leland, the antiquary, alluding to this circumstance, says, \" Gul: maritus Matildis fugims apud Shorham mutatis vestibus tanquam medicus transfretavit in Franc: & paulo post Parisiis obiit.\" Vide the Collect., vol. i., p. 280, Hearne's Ed. His wife's ungovernable temper, together with his own rebellious disposition, had a good deal to do with the calamities that overtook them. She was, before her husband's death, put into prison at Windsor, and starved to death, together with her eldest son William,t in 1210. Leland, speaking of this unfor tunate lady, alludes to her miserable end as follows : \u2014 \" Anno D. 1210., Matildis femina nobliss: uxor Gul: de Brausa & filius ejus Gulielmus & heres apud Wyndslesore miscrabiliter fame perierunt, jubente rege Anglorum Joanne.\" Vide Collect, vol. i., p. 280. WiUiam and Matilda left several sons, the eldest being Giles, Bishop of Hereford, who, immediately his father was dead, rose in arms and seized on his lands, frightening King John into granting them to him, they having been already confiscated owing to the paternal misdemeanors. This Giles was a proud, fickle, imperious baron, much like unto his father. He was consecrated Bishop Sept., 1200. In the Barons' wars he took part with them against the King, and was at last obliged to fly the country ; but being afterwards aUowed to return, he died at Gloucester about 1215. According to Bishop Godwin he was buried in Hereford Cathedral, on the north side of the Presbytery, and holds the model of a steeple in his hand. He managed to get his lands passed on to his brother Reginald, who consequently in herited all his possessions, and held, among other properties in * This Charter, as will be seen, was frequently quoted in the various proceedings which afterwards tojik place between the successors of this William de Braose, and Henry HI-, Edward I , and Edward II., Kings of England. t Suruamed Gam, a Welsh word signifying crooked, awry ; from a squint in his eye."], [44, "30 Gower, the Lordship of Reynoldston, called after him Reginalds town, now Reynoldston. He died a.d. 1228. Reginald was succeeded by his son William, who was taken prisoner by Llewelyn, Prince of North Wales, in a battle between the latter and Henry the Third, King of England. He was afterwards liberated for a large ransom ; but being detected in an intrigue with Llewelyn's wife, was hung * on a tree by the . enraged Prince. The following interesting letter relating to this event has been preserved. \" ROYAL LETTERS, 770.

If so, he would seem at least to be entitled to the credit of the joke being original.\" The locality where this execution took place is stated by Pennant * to have been on a hill near the village of Aber in Caernarvonshire,! on which grew the gallows tree (Crogbren), where in aU probabihty many persons had suffered besides this unfortunate WiUiam. Crokin is evidently a play upon this word. I am not aware that there is any spot in that neighbourhood called Crokein. J If there had been, Pennant would most likely have mentioned it. What he says is this, \" At the entrance of the Glen, close to the viUage, is a large artificial mount, flat at the top, and near sixty feet in diameter, widening towards the base. It was once the site of a castle belonging to Llewelyn the Great. In this place was discovered the intrigue of William de Breos (son of Reginald, a potent Baron in the reign of Henry III.) with the wife of Llewelyn. It seems that William, by chance of war, had before faUen into the hands of our Prince, at which time pro bably the familiarity with the Princess commenced, but was not discovered tiU after he was released on a large ransom. The vindictive Llewelyn in the following year (1229), inveigled Breos into his power by an invitation to celebrate the feast of Easter ; when, after a sumptuous banquet, the Prince reproached him with his crime, and caused him to be dragged from his presence, || and hung on an adjacent hill.\" The same author states that he was buried near the village of Llandegai. \" In my way, near a field caUed Cae Gwilim Ddu, is an artificial cave, in which (tradition says) was interred WiUiam de Breos, executed by Llewelyn the Great.\" John de Braose, \u00a7 son of WiUiam de Braose and Matilda, daughter of De Clare, Earl of Glo'ster, and the rightful heir of * \" Pennant's Tours in Wales,\" vol. iii., p.p. 105 and 111. t At Swansea is a Gibbet Hill, now better known as the Town Hill.

Of a Parliament of our Lord the King at West- minster, in the Octave of St. John the Baptist, in the 30th year (i.e.) of the King's reign. \"Wales ff. No. 3. Concerning WiUiam de Brewose, &c, (M. 3). \"William de Breouse heretofore, to wit, at a Parliament of the Lord the King at Westminster in Lent in the 28th year of his reign, directed a certain petition to the King and his Council after these words. \" To our Lord the King and to his Council sheweth WiUiam de Breousa, That there where he holds, and bis ancestors before him have held, aU the land of Gower in its entirety, with aU the franchises, frank customs, and frank usages, to the said land appertaining, by the service of a knight for all services, there came Walter de Pederton, constable of Caermarthen, and caused summons to be served upon tbe said WiUiam at his castle of Swansea, to come to answer the plaints of his people on the morrow at the castle of Caermarthen, a place where he never answered or ought to answer. And because that to this summons he did not come, he made grievous distraint upon him. Also he caused summons to be served on the agents of the said Wm. (to come to) the Castle of Caermarthen, to answer to the aforesaid plaintiffs of the laud of Gower. And because that they came not,"], [65, "51 he caused to be served a writ of exigent * from County day to County day, even to outlawry. This matter was shewn to our Lord the King by way of complaint by the aforesaid WiUiam, and order was given by the King to the aforesaid Constable, that of all kind of such grievances touching the said Wilham there should be a stay of proceedings until this Parliament. That at no time by any such order was there a stay of proceedings, so much so that the people were thrown into the prison at Caer marthen, and he made lodgement of them according to his wiU. Therefore the said Wm. prays to our Lord the King and to his Council, that there where no man ought to have cognizance of him or of his people of Gower (except before the King himself in person) so please him, according to the purport of his charter (which is admitted) he should be willing to maintain it, and in respect of such grievances to give right and remedy. \" To which petition the aforesaid Walter de Pederton, who came there by command of the King, then answered and said, as well for the King as himself, that the aforesaid land of Gower is within the precincts of the County of the Lord the King of Caermarthen, and that the- same WiUiam and his predecessors, and also the tenants of the same land of Gower, were always accustomed to make suit to the aforesaid county, and then did so, and that the Lord the King was then seized of suit of the same persons at the same county. And he required that the same WiUiam, if he had anything of the aforesaid liberty which he claimed to have in his petition aforesaid, and also of the exemption of suit of himself and his tenants to the same county, should show it to the King and his CouncU. And the same WiUiam then said that the Lord, King John, the grandfather of the present Lord the King, gave and gramed, and by his Charter confirmed, to his beloved and faithful, a certain WiUiam de Breouse, a pre decessor of this William, whose heir he is, all the land in Gower, with its appurtenances in Wales, to have and to hold to him and his heirs, of the King himself and his heirs, by the service of one knight for all service. And he wiUed and firmly enjoined, that * \"A writ exigent.\" A writ that lieth when the defendant in an action cannot be found, nor anything within the county whereby to be attached or distrained, and is directed to the Sheriff to proclaim and call five county days one after another, charging him to appear under pain of outlawiy. The writ also lieth in an indiction for felony where the party iudictod cannot be found.\u2014 Law French Die, by F. 0."], [66, "52 the aforesaid William, and his heirs after him, should have and liold the whole of the aforesaid land of Gower with aU its appur tenances in Wales, of the King himself and his heirs, by the aforesaid service, as aforesaid, well and peacefuUy, freely, quietly, whoUy, and fully, and honourably, with all its liberties and free customs in all places and aU things appertaining to the aforesaid land. \" And he produced the Charter of the aforesaid Lord King John, which testified the same thing. And he said that all his predecessors from the time of the making the aforesaid Charter, and likewise he himself during the whole of his own time, held in the aforesaid land of Gower every kind of royal jurisdic tion over the tenants of the same, and cognizance of aU pleas in the said land, in whatsoever manner arising. And further than this (he denied), that the predecessors of this Wilham or his tenants of the aforesaid land, made any suit to the said county, or replied to any in the same county about any matter ; and he said that they enjoyed that same liberty fuUy, whoUy, well, and peacefuUy, and without any interruption, by virtue of the Charter aforesaid, until the aforesaid Walter, at the time that he was Sheriff of the aforesaid County of Caermarthen, grievously dis trained the same WiUiam, and the men and tenants of his afore said land of Gower, and frequently troubled them to make suit to the county aforesaid, and to reply in the same county to all persons whomsoever entering plaints against them. \" Moreover, he said, that WiUiam de Breousa his father, and whose heir he is, died siezed of the same Royal jurisdiction in the aforesaid land. And further than this (he denied), that his father WiUiam, or his tenants in his time, made any suit to the county aforesaid, or replied to any in the same ; and (he said) that he succeeded him in the same land, and likewise in the same liberty, as his son and heir. And he demanded if he ought to answer without a writ, &c, since his predecessor died seized of the same liberty, &c. \" And because the aforesaid Wilham, in his petition which he gratuitously preferred, said, that he holds such liberty by the aforesaid Charter of the King, and moreover has submitted the same Charter for his title and right of the same liberty, and thus pleaded gratuitously, and without any compulsion, touching the right and title of the aforesaid liberty, it appeared to the Council"], [67, "53 of the Lord the King that in the matter of the aforesaid answers, recourse could not, and ought not, to be had to a writ of pos session, since he first answered in right, and submitted the title of his right. \"Wherefore, it was said to the aforesaid Walter, that he should speak as weU for the Lord the King as himself, if he wished or knew anything more to say. And the same Walter said that the aforesaid William could not claim the aforesaid liberty of having or exercising Royal jurisdiction in the said land of Gower, or of having exemption of suit of the aforesaid County of Caermarthen, by virtue of the aforesaid Charter of the Lord King John which he produced. For he said that it is contained in the aforesaid Charter that the Lord King John, &c, gave and granted and confirmed by his Charter to a certain William de Breousa, an ancestor of this WiUiam, aU the land of Gower, with its appur tenances in Wales. To have and to hold for himself and his heirs, &c, as is contained in the said Charter, and that by virtue of the Charter aforesaid there could accrue to him nothing more or other than is contained in the same Charter. Wherefore, in as much as the Royal jurisdiction which the said WUliam, who now is, claims to have, in the said land of Gower, by the Charter aforesaid, is not specially mentioned in the same Charter, and is not expressly granted to the ancestor of this WUUam, and such liberty could not of common right be said to belong to any land although the land aforesaid with its appurtenances may have been given and granted to his ancestor, (since such liberty purely belongs to the Crown Royal, and not to any land, and could not be separated from the Crown by general words, unless specially expressed and mentioned), and the same William does not show anything special thereof, he demands judgment for the Lord the King, &c. And touching this, a day was given by the King himself to the said William, at the next following Parliament, for having his judgment on this matter. And it was said to the said Walter, that in like manner, he should be there to prosecute for the Lord the King the imparlance aforesaid. And in like manner, because divers men of the aforesaid land of Gower submitted to the aforesaid Parliament, divers complaints, con tained in their petitions against the aforesaid William and his ministers of the land aforesaid. It was then told those men that they should be at that same coming Parliament. For that the"], [68, "54 Lord the King could not hear and terminate those complaints in the course of justice, before discussion had taken place between the Lord the King liimself and the aforesaid WiUiam concerning the jurisdiction aforesaid, and as to which of them that juris diction pertains and ought to pertain, since cognizance of the complaints aforesaid depended on the jurisdiction aforesaid, which the aforesaid William claimed. And then an injunction was laid on this same WiUiam under pain of forfeiture of the aforesaid liberty which he claimed in the said land, and also of the land aforesaid, that in the meanwhile he should do no injury, harm, or grievance to the same complainants, contrary to justice, or the custom of those parts, &c. \" Afterwards, at the next following ParUament of the Lord the King, to wit, at Lincoln, in the Octave of St. Hilary, in the 29th year of the reign of our present Lord the King, the aforesaid William de Breouse and Nicholas de Warwick, who sued for the King, and in like manner the men aforesaid, from the aforesaid land of Gower, came complaining in the form aforesaid, and were adjourned to sue hi the form enjoined and above expressed. And when these persons appeared before the King and his Council, and certain disputes between the Lord the King and the aforesaid WUUam had for some time been discussed concerning the afore- said jurisdiction, and various considerations contained and set forth in the records of the aforesaid trial had been propounded by both parties, a day was given to the said WiUiam at the Parlia- ment next foUowing to hear his judgment in the imparlance aforesaid. And in hke manner then it was told to the aforesaid complainants, that they should be at that same ParUament to prosecute their complaints if they wished. And it was then forbidden the same WiUiam, by a writ of the Lord the King, that in the meanwhile he should not, while his complaints were pending before the King and his CouncU, do any injuries or any grievances to the same complainants. \" Afterwards, to that Parliament of the Lord the King at West minster, on the Octave of St. John the Baptist, in the 30th year of his reign, came the aforesaid WUUam de Breouse, and in like manner Nicholas de Warwick, who sues for the King, &c, and also the aforesaid men of Gower, before complaining, &c. And the same William pressingly demanded that the King and his Council should give him relief and justice for the injuries and"], [69, "55 grievances done to him, as is contained in his petition aforesaid, and which were done to him by the aforesaid Walter, contrary to the liberties aforesaid, which he has, and ought to have, within the aforesaid land of Gower, and his ancestors had, from the time of the completion of the aforesaid Charter of the Lord King John, and by which Charter he claims and says that he ought to have the aforesaid liberty and jurisdiction, and that all his ancestors from the time of the making of the aforesaid Charter had it within his land of Gower. And which liberty and jurisdiction are such that he ought to have his own Chancery and his own ChanceUor, and his own seal in the same Chancery for serving out to his men and tenants of the aforesaid land of Gower, when necessary, judgment of life and limb, and also cognizance of aU pleas, as well of the Crown as of any other things whatsoever, arising within the said land, betwreen any persons whatsoever, as of a land being in a March, and without the aforesaid County of Caermarthen, and without the power of the Sheriff of the same county. And he said that the ancestor of the present Earl of Warwick, in whose hands the aforesaid land of Gower was, before that land came into the hands of the Lord King John by virtue ofthe lordship thereof, enjoyed that liberty fully and whoUy, that is to say, they had their own Chancery and their own seal there, jurisdiction of giving judgment of life and hmb, and cognizance of aU pleas arising between any persons whatsoever within the said land of Gower. And also, that the aforesaid Lord John the King, from the time when the aforesaid land came into his hand, and the whole time he wras seized of the same, had a certain bailiff of his own there, specially deputed for keeping custody of that land, who guarded that same land as separate by itself, and in no way belonging to the County of Caermarthen, but as altogether separate from the county aforesaid, and used the seal of the Lord the King aforesaid in the form aforesaid, during the whole time of the said King, and also aU the jurisdiction aforesaid in the same land ; and further than this (he denied), that the tenants of that land, at that time, made any suit to the County of Caermarthen, or that the Sheriff of that county, by reason of his shrievalty aforesaid, had or exercised any jurisdiction or power upon tenants of the aforesaid land of Gower. And he says, likewise, that the said William, his ancestor, whose heir he is, and to whom the aforesaid Charter was made, entered upon the"], [70, "56 said land of Gower by virtue of the same charter, and used the same liberty in aU his time in the aforesaid land, weU and in peace, by reason of the aforesaid charter, that is to say, a Royal jurisdiction in every respect as aforesaid, and further than this (he denies), that he or his tenants of the aforesaid land, made suit to the said county, or replied to any in the same county. And, likewise, aU the heirs of the aforesaid WiUiam, his ancestor, the first purchaser by the said Charter, and likewise he himself in aU his own time, enjoyed the same liberty, fully and whoUy, and without interruption, until the said Walter de Pederton for the first time, and from the period when he became the sheriff of the County of Caermarthen, wishing to disinherit William, and to throw him and the tenants of his aforesaid land into a state of servitude, frequently distrained upon WiUiam himself and the men of the land aforesaid, to compel them to make the aforesaid suit to the County of Caermarthen, to the manifest disherison of WilUam himself, and against the tenor of the Royal Charter aforesaid. And he demanded that a remedy be appointed, touch ing this, by the King himself and his Councd, as is more fuUy contained in his own petition, &c. \"And Nicholas de Warwick, who sues for the King, says, that the aforesaid land of Gower is within the precincts of the afore said County of Caermarthen, and always was so, as weU in the times of the ancestors of the present Earl of Warwick, while that land was in their hands ; as also during the whole time that the aforesaid land was in the seizin of the said Lord King John ; and that the aforesaid WiUiam and aU his ancestors, from the time of the completion of the Charter aforesaid, were accustomed, and did make suit to the aforesaid County of Caermarthen. And that aU the ancestors of the said WiUiam, and Ukewise the tenants of the same land of Gower, in times past, as weU from the time of the making of the aforesaid Charter of the Lord King John, as before the times of the ancestors of the said Earl of Warwick, were accustomed to make suit to the same county, and to answer there to all persons wishing to complain about them, and to receive justice there, until WiUiam de Breouse, father of the present WiUiam, after the battle of Evesham, drew that suit to himself, to the disherison of the Lord the King, and withdrew it from the Lord the King, the father of the present King, aud entirely disinherited the Lord the King of that suit being made to the"], [71, "57 County of Caermarthen, and usurped and occupied without any warrant over the Lord the King, father of the present Lord the King, the aforesaid Royal jurisdiction, which the same present WiUiam now claims in the aforesaid land, according, as is clearly and expressly by the acknowledgement of the aforesaid WiUiam in the plea aforesaid, especially when the same William only claims the aforesaid jurisdiction by the aforesaid Charter of the Lord King John. And in which Charter there is no special mention made of any Royal jurisdiction, or exemption of suit of the county aforesaid granted to the aforesaid Wilham, ancestor of the said present William, since such Royal jurisdiction is so annexed to the Crown, that apart from a special deed it cannot be separated from the Crown, as is above mentioned. Moreover, he says, for the Lord the King, that when any Royal liberties are granted with any land to any one, by the Charter and deed of the King, and that land, with those liberties, should afterwards, from whatever cause, come back to the hand of the King ; that, although the King may have granted and given that land with its appurtenances to any one, without expressly making mention of jurisdiction and Royal liberty, that the Royal liberties which before appertained to the Royal Crown, and returned and became annexed to that Crown, could not by such general words, \" with their appurtenances,\" be separated from the Crown in any way. Nay, they remain intact to the Crown itself, unless those liberties be specially granted, named, and expressed by a special deed. Therefore, whereas the said William well knew that the aforesaid land with its appurtenances, after the seizin of the ancestors of the present Earl of Warwick, came into the hand of the Lord the King John, grandfather of the present King, and by whose gift and grant that land afterwards came into the hands of the an cestors of the aforesaid William, and by the aforesaid Charter, and in which Charter, indeed, there is no special mention made of any jurisdiction Royal as aforesaid, or otherwise, demands judgment for the King peremptorily, &c. \u2022' Afterwards, wiien the aforesaid record and process were recited and examined before the Lord the King in person, although the King, according to the strict course of justice, as appeared to many and the majority of his Council, could have proceeded to judgment against the aforesaid William according to the form and manner of the aforesaid plea and the custom of his court, and without i"], [72, "58 taking any inquisition thereof through the country ; nevertheless, the same Lord the King, of his special grace, wishing to deal gently with the said William, and to be more fully certified touching the premises, and at the importunity of the aforesaid William, who, touching the premises, placed himself gratuitously upon the inquisition of the country, and required the inquisition thereof to be made, granted, and enjoined, that the truth of the aforesaid jurisdiction, customary in the aforesaid land, as well from the time of the ancestors of the Earl of Warwick, formerly Lords of that land, as from the time when that land was in the hand of the Lord King John, and likewise from the time when that land, by the grant and gift of the Lord King John, came into the hands of the ancestors of WiUiam, should be inquired into by the country. And that that inquisition when taken should be returned to the Lord the King at his next Parliament, after the Feast of St. Michael at Westminster. And a day was given to the said William to hear his judgment thereof at that same Parliament. And J. Wogan, William Mortimer, and Walter Haklut, &c, are appointed to take that inquisition in the form aforesaid, and also in like manner to take the other in quisitions, in which the same William placed himself before John de Havering, William Inge, Roger de Suthcote, and Walter de Pederton, auditors in the matter of divers transgressions and complaints, done by WiUiam de Breouse to divers men of the aforesaid land of Gower, after the inhibition aforesaid was made to WilUam himself, as the same complainants assert, and in which inquisitions the aforesaid complainants, and also the said William, placed themselves, as appears by the process and record thereof held before the aforesaid auditors, so that they should take those inquisitions in the aforesaid parts, and return the same inquisitions to the Lord the King at the next aforesaid Parlia ment, and appoint to the parties the same term for hearing their judgment thereof. \" And be it known that that record, and also other records, of pleas held before the aforesaid auditors, are sent to the afore said J. Wogan and his colleagues, under the foot of the seal of the Lord the King, &c. \" And it is commanded to Edward, son of the King, Prince of Wales, that from his counties of Caermarthen and Cardigan, and also from his town and land of Haverfordwest ; and in like"], [73, "59 manner it is commanded to Johanna de Valence, Countess of Pembroke, that from her land of Pembroke should cause to come, before the aforesaid J.

From divers complaints of men and tenants of William de Brewosa of the land of Gower and town of Swansea, conveyed to us by their petitions, presented to us by our Council, we have learned that the same William has frequently brought upon the said men and tenants divers trespasses, injuries, and grievances, through himself as well as his agents, after our inhibitions by us made and brought before him, and that the same William, under colour of a certain Charter of ours, relating to certain liberties by us given to him, assumes and takes upon himself, most irregularly, jurisdiction of conducting trials in his Courts of Gower and Swansea by a justice and sheriff, w'hom he has newly appointed there, by allowing trials to be conducted in those Courts by suitors of the same, as he has hitherto never been accustomed to do in any wise, to the very great expense of those men and tenants, and contrary to law and the custom of those parts, as in their petitions aforesaid, which we send you under the stamp of our seal is more fully contained. We therefore being willing to help the said men and tenants in this behalf, and wishing to be certified concerning the custom of conducting trials of this sort in the aforesaid Courts, that is to say, by what person or persons they have been ac customed to be conducted in times past, we have appointed you our justices for inquiring by the oath of good and loyal men of the aforesaid land of Gower and town of Swansea, by whom, &c., and concerning the trespasses, injuries, and grievances aforesaid, and also in respect of the custom aforesaid, with all fulness and truthfulness. But so that if those inquisitions, or any of them, shall be unable to be taken by means of the men of the land and town aforesaid, by reason of the likely intrigues of the parties, then they or it shall be taken by the oath of good and loyal men of the neighbouring parts, that is to say, of the Counties of Caer marthen and Cardigan, and the land and town of Haverfordwest, and of the land of Pembroke, both for hearing the trespasses,"], [76, "62 injuries, and grievances aforesaid, and terminating them accord- ing to law and the custom of those parts, and also for hearing and terminating all trespasses and injuries brought upon the said men and tenants by the aforesaid William and his agents, before our inhibitions aforesaid made to the same Wilham, unless the same William before your coming to the said town of Swansea shall immediately do full justice to the same men and tenants.

This John de Mowbray, who married Alina, daughter of the Lost William de Braose, Lord of Gower of this name, was son and heir of Roger de Mowbray (by Rose, daughter of Richard and sister of Gilbert de Clare, Earls of Gloucester and Hereford). He became the wrard of the above-named William de Braose, who obtained the guardianship for the purpose of marrying him to his daughter Alina, which he succeeded in doing. In the fourteenth year of Edward II. there were great dis putes about the possessions in Gower between this John de Mowbray, the Earl of Hereford, the Mortimers, and Despencers. John claimed by right of his wife; and it appeal's that his father in-law \u2014 a most unscrupulous man, who deceived everybody \u2014 had settled the property upon him, but without the leave of the King, and then afterwards, with much double dealing, and wishing to ingratiate himself with his Sovereign, put Hugh de Spencer in possession, as appears by the following Charters : \u2014 [translation]. \" CHAPTER HOUSE.

This latter family being in high favour with the King he was anxious to secure the Gower lands for his favourite, and it was probably with this intention that wre find him, about the year 1321, attempting to take them from de Mowbray by force. \"ROTULORUM ORIGINALIUM ABBEVATIO, 14th EDWARD II.it \" The King to Richard de Rodeneye, Escheator on this side of Trent, greeting.

John de Mowbray,* son and heir of the aforesaid John, was saved from the wreck of his father's fortune by an Act passed in the 1st year of Edward III., for restoring the forfeited lands of those who had been engaged in the quarrel of the Earl of Lancaster. And in the same year, in consideration of the eminent services of his ancestors, performed his homage before he was of age, and had livery of his lands. The Corporation of the town of Swansea possesses a translated copy of a Charter f from Edward III. to Ahna, the widow of John de Mowbray, confirming, for a grant jff one hundred shillings, a grant of the Seigniory of Gower, which had been made by former Kings to her ancestors. In this Charter it is recited that William de Braose, the father of Ahna, had settled the Seigniory on his son-in-law, John de Mowbray, without obtaining any license from the preceding Sovereign. Among the MSS. of the late Mr. Rees Jones, of Loughor, there is an abstract of a conveyance from Elenor (i.e. Alina) de Mowbray, dated at Oystermouth, on the 20th of January, in the 2nd year of Edward III. (a.d. 1329) of a tenement at Predwen, in the fee of Loughor, from which we may conclude that she \u00bb He died at York of the pestilence, 4th Oct., 35 Edward III., 1361. t I obtained a transcript of this Charter from the Becord Office, where the original is preserved. It will be found a little further on in the pages of this work."], [86, "72 hved at Oystermouth Castle, her father William de Braose's pro perty, aud where it is known he resided. Her son, John de Mowbray, was frequently in active service for the King, and seems to have well atoned for his father's treason. In the 2nd year of Edward III. we find him ordered to array the men of Gower land against an expected invasion of the French. He seems to have been frequently caUed upon to assemble his Gower vassals. In the 12th year of Edward III., and on the 4th of February, he and his lieutenant of Gowerland, were ordered to assist Bartholomew Burghersh, the King's admiral, in raising provisions and ammunition for the ships then about to sail on an expedition against France. On the 12th of November, the 16'th of Edward III., he received letters from the King (then in Brittany) to make certain preparations in his wars with France. He was ordered to prepare forty men at aims and forty archers for that service, and to be at London on the octave of St. Hilary to settle in Council the wages of the soldiers, and to array 123 men of his land of Gowrer on the same occasion. In the 18th of Edward III. we find him, with others, ordered to array 150 men of Gower to attend the King on his voyage to France. We may fairly conclude, therefore, that together with his Gower retainers, John de Mowbray was present at the battle of Cresey, though his name is not mentioned in Froissart's account of that battle. In the 26th of Edward III.* he was one of the commissioners in Yorkshire for guarding the sea coast against a threatened invasion of the French, and was charged to find thirty men out of Gowerland. This John de Mowbray, in 1334, as Lord of Gowrer, confirmed a Charter of Henry and WiUiam, Earls of Warwick, of certain rights and privileges belonging to the Abbey of Neath.

Shortly after the conquest of Gower by the Earl of Warwick, and early in the 12th century, a new race of people appear on the scene, who, under the protection of their Norman friends, settled in the Peninsula ; these are the Flemings,* from whom the present inhabitants are descended. This, howrever, has been doubted on the following grounds. (1). Because it is affirmed that there is no direct historical evidence that the Flemings so settled here. (2). From the fact that the English language having been spoken in Gower for centuries, it has been thought that the in habitants are people from Devonshire aud Somersetshire, and that the limestone trade which is still carried on between Oxwich and Bideford, and formerly to a much greater extent than now, favours such a supjiosition, as the traffic wrould naturaUy bring the people very much together, and be the means of introducing Englishmen, and finaUy the English tongue, into Gower. (3). ft has been stated that no traces exist of the domestic architecture of the Flemings in Gower, as in Pembrokeshire, where it is well known they settled. (4). That there are no Flemish names of people to be met with, nor any remains of the Flemish language. In answer to these objections against a Flemish settlement in Gower, I believe I am right in saying, that they have been brought forward by those who have not taken sufficient time to make themselxes thoroughly acquainted with the language, man ners, customs, and traditions of the district, and have, therefore, formed their conclusions on the subject too hastily. A question of this kind cannot be settled at a distance, or by any one, however competent he may be, unless he has all the materials before him ; and these are not to be got together by a hasty ride, or a week's walk in Gower. A vocabulary of aU the * In Welsh, Flynion."], [110, "96 peculiar words and expressions, now fast passing away, but stdl to be found in Gower, is not to be made in a day or a year, and it would be quite impossible for anybody, except one who had lived long among the people, and taken an interest in the subject, to get the necessary information. To discover any reUcs of the domestic architecture of the Flemings, the district must be carefuUy searched, a proceeding that would occupy a considerable time. In replying to the objections of those who endeavour to shake the credit of the tradition, current among the Gower people, as to theh Flemish origin, it is with much gratification I am able to say, that the required direct historical evidence exists \u2014 the Flemish language can be traced \u2014 Flemish names of people are stiU to be met with \u2014 and positive remains of Flemish architecture are to be found. The question of the origin of the present inhabitants of Gower was made the subject of a very interesting discussion at one of the evening meetings of the Cambrian Arch\u00e6ological Society, held at Swansea in 1861, and reported at length in the Arch\u0153ologia Cambrensis, vol. vii., 1861. The debate which then took place, turned chiefly upon the want of any direct historical evidence, the language of the people, and the absence of any distinctly Flemish names of persons. The question whether traces of Flemish architecture were to be found was not gone into on that occasion ; but in a letter from the Rev. C. L. Hartshorne, F.S.A., written some few years after, and which appeared in the Arch\u0153ologia Camb., the non existence of such traces was implied. This was answered by Sir Gardner Wilkinson, F.G.S., which produced another letter from Mr. Hartshorne, acknowledging the soundness of Sir Gardner's remarks, and expressing his (Mr. Hartshorne's) regret at forming his opinion too hastUy. As the letter of so eminent an Arch\u00e6ologist as the late Sir G. Wilkinson wiU be read with interest, I therefore reprint it here. \" To the Editor of the Cambrian Journal. \" Sir, \u2014 In the December number of the Cambrian Journal (1861, p. 245) is a paper by the Rev. C. H. Hartshorne, in which he calls in question the Flemish colonization of Pembrokeshire and Gower, and appeals to the style of the architecture in Tenby and its neighbourhood, in order to disprove this long received tradition."], [111, "97 \" The remarks of so able an arch\u00e6ologist are deserving of all respect ; but, in consequence of their commanding that respect, it is of importance that we should not aUow them to pass without sifting the evidence for and against the tradition he so summarily rejects. Mr. Hartshorne concludes, from the appearance of the castles, and other remains at Tenby, and various places in that part of Pembrokeshire, that they are not of Flemish work. He pronounces them to ' indicate a close adherence to the Edwardian style ' \u2014 (p. 246) ; and he expresses a ' conviction that they have been erected for the most part betwixt the commencement of the reign of Edward I., and the end of that of his successor.' \u2014 (p. 248.) ' There is nothing,' he adds, ' throughout the interesting peninsida of Gower that is either earlier or much later. At Tenby there remains actually nothing, except portions of the church, that belongs to previous a reign.' \" Now, if aU those rem.iins were of the period he mentions, which I by no means admit, this would not in any way disprove the previous settlement of Flemings in those districts ; they were, after all, only settlers placed there by the English monarch ; the country belonged to the great Norman chieftains ; and it was not necessarily of importance to the question of architecture, whether the people were of English or Flemish origin. The style of the castles, and other large edifices, would, in all probabiUty, be the same which prevailed in England ; and the only buildings which could be expected to exhibit Flemish peculiarities were the dwel- lings of the people. What peculiarities do exist there, I will not stop to inquire ; for it is not from the style of the architecture that we are obliged to judge on this occasion, since the authority of history is far more trustworthy, and of far greater weight, in deciding the question respecting this Flemish settlement. Indeed, if history is to be set aside, we may be required to doubt the truth of every event known to have occurred in this or any other country ; and so many of our long-established notions have been disturbed by doubts, in cases where no direct evidence could be adduced to prove their accuracy, that even the best authenticated have not escaped this tendency of modern times. It is true that tradition is not always to be reUed upon ; but there is little reason to question it in this instance. The Welsh are not likely to have received it from the writings of learned men, stiU less from those of late time ; and no one will suppose, when they call N"], [112, "98 the people of the southern part of Pembrokeshire and Gower 'Fleming,' as a term of reproach, that it was from any other reason than because that foreign race was reaUy Flemish. Nor was it from any other motive that they abstained for ages from intermarrying with them ; and in Gower marriages with the Welsh are stiU almost entirely unknown. The cause of this hatred between the two races is easily explained, when we learn the reason of the Flemings being ' located ' in this part of Wales ; and the fact of the Flemish settlement there is proved beyond all doubt, by the authority of contemporaneous history. It is men tioned by AVilliam of Malmesbury, a writer of the time, who states that Henry I., in 1106, 'transported into Pembrokeshire aU the Flemings then resident in England,' the country at that time containing a great number who had been brought over in the time of his father, as well as those who arrived during his own reign ; and the same is again recorded by HolUnshed, and others, who assert that, in 1107, many Flemings came over, in consequence of a great inundation of the sea in their own country, and were first permitted to dweU in Cumberland, or, according to Hollinshed, on the east of the Tweed ; whence, four years afterwards, they were removed by Henry, together with those who had previously settled there in the reign of William the Conqueror. Their numbers, he adds, at that time ' had so greatly increased, that the realm of England was sore pestered with them ; whereupon King Henry devised to place them in Pembrokeshire,' hoping at the same time that they would be useful in quelling ' the turbu lence of the AVelsh.' A similar statement is made by another and an earlier writer, Giraldus Cambrensis, who, from living at Manorbeer, in the very neighbourhood, may be considered a most reliable authority, and who, as early as 1188, mentions the Flemish settlement in Pembrokeshire, where, he says, they were first 'located' by Henry in the district called Ros (where Haverfordwest now stands). He then describes them as ' brave and robust, ever hostile to the Welsh, a people weU versed in commerce and woollen manufactures ; ' and Powel, in his Welsh Chronicle, after noticing the same fact of their settlement in Ros observes, ' they there remain to this day, as may be readUy per ceived by their speech and conditions, far differing from the rest of the country.' The Brut y Tywgsogion, ' Chronicle of the Princes,' written at the end of the thirteenth century, repeats"], [113, "99 //o6. the account of their settlement there ; and Powel, after men tioning their arrival, in tO+#, in consequence of an inundation in Flanders, adds that Henry I. sent them into the district of Ros, in Dyvet, or Pembrokeshire, where they were placed ' under the protection of the Norman lords already in possession of parts of that country.' They were not, therefore, necessarily the in troducers of any particular kind of architecture in the ' churches, towers, town walls,' or castles ; being a sort of military and industrial colony under Norman chieftains ; though it must be admitted that the churches, both about Tenby and in Gower, are of a very peculiar character, unknown in any other part of England or AVales. \" Many other evidences of their settlement in Pembrokeshire are found in various AVelsh MSS., but the above wiU suffice to show how well authenticated is this fact ; and as contemporaneous hi.tory is worthy of credit, we cannot allow our belief to be shaken by doubts raised from the appearance of buildings, the style of which might, or might not, have been influenced by the Flemings, and their settlement in the country. \"That the people of Gower are also of Flemish origin is proclaimed by the traditions of the people themselves, and of the Welsh, whose prejudices against them are still apparent ; and the fact of the Flemings and Normans, when defeated by the Welsh, in 1135, retreating into Gower, (which, like Pembrokeshire, was held by Norman barons,) seems to confirm it ; and even if, as some suppose, this event led to the first settlement of the Flemings in that peninsula, the Flemish origin of its present inhabitants would be equally established. Their language, their own as well as Welsh tradition, and their appearance, aU tend to confirm it; but the idea of their migration from Somersetshire is at variance with every appearance of probability ; and I cannot do better than refer the reader to vol. ii. of the Arch\u0153ologia Cambrensis, (pp. 359-361, Third Series,) where Mr. Stephen ably refutes the opinion, or rather the assertion, of those who deny that 'the English-speaking people of Pembrokeshire and Gower were originaUy Flemish.' I may also refer to the Arch\u0153ologia Cam brensis, Second Series, vol. i., p. 138; ii. pp. 214, 315, 317 ; iv. p. 122, for some remarks on the same subject. \" Mr. Hartshorne would lead us to suppose (p. 247) that the circular chimneys in Pembrokeshire assumed that form, like the"], [114, "100 round towers of the Norfolk churches, ' because the stones were not large enough to build them square ; ' but his remark is not borne out by fact, as ashlar stone of any size may be as easily obtained there as in most parts of our island ; and neither the round shape of the chimneys, nor the rectangular form of the Pembrokeshire towers, is influenced 'by the material supplied from the quarries ' of that country, noted, as it is, for the great variety of its strata. And when he states that there is nothing in Gower earher than the reign of Edward I., I cannot refrain from re minding him of the very early portion of the tower of Llangennydd with its Romanesque arch, and the highly ornamented Norman doorway of Rhossili Church. But while I give my reasons for dissenting from him, I do so with great respect for his weU-known proficiency in medi\u00e6val arch\u00e6ology ; and I should not have noticed his statements, were it not of importance that the weight of his authority should not be cited in support of an opinion at variance with aU that history and tradition have imparted to us. \" I remain, &c, \" Reged.* \" Gower, 7th June, 1862.\" As the publication alluded to above is taken by comparatively few people, and as fewer stiU would take the trouble to search out the particular debate recorded there, by my merely referring to it, the Editor has kindly allowed me to reprint the article, which, as it fairly opens out the whole case, was almost absolutely necessary. After some observations made by different members of the Society on Swansea and Oystermouth Castles, Dr. AYilliams then made some remarks on the Ethnology of Gower. \" Most of them well knew the tradition that the original inhabitants of Gower traveUed over from Flanders by sea, and settled in the South Western portion of Glamorganshire, and the neighbourhood of Tenby. Such was the generatty received story of their origin. Feeling interested in the question, he had requested Dr. Latham, the celebrated Lexicographer, when on a visit to Swansea, to make a tour through Gower ; and that gentleman, after paying due attention to the language of the inhabitants, came to the con clusion that neither in the names of their rivers, mountains, churches, nor in any articles, did their words in any way show * The name under which Sir Gardner Wilkinson wrote the above letter"], [115, "101 that their origin was derived from Flanders ; that neither their idioms, nor nouns substantive bore any analogy to the language spoken in Belgium, nor did anything that he saw or heard, give him any reason to suppose that the original settlers had crossed the channel from the Continent. He himself had been in con versation with the inhabitants of the peninsula, and he had been surprised at the confidence with which many persons had contended for their Flemish origin. He regretted exceedingly that time had not enabled him to lay down the ground on which his arguments were based, but he thought he should be able to place before them facts, which would convince them, that he had good reason to consider that the Saxon language was the ground work of the present language of Gower. If they looked at the geography of the peninsula, they would find that the line of coast was parallel with the west coast of England, and that that parallel extended to that part of Pembrokeshire where the English language was also spoken, and he w-as in a condition to prove, that the language spoken in southern Pembrokeshire and Gower was of the same origin as the language spoken on the other side of the Bristol Channel. The occupation of both sides of the Channel by one and the same people, was not at all an improbable hypothesis, and if he went into details, he should be able to strengthen the con viction, by pointing out, that the same words for the names of mountains, castles, trees, and so forth, differed only in a slight degree from the same names in Somersetshire and Devonshire ; and although the idioms differed, the true philology was the same. He therefore surmised that the ancient settlers acted on migratory principles, or were driven to this coast by a stormy wind ; and he contended that it was utterly contrary to the laws of ethnology that the language spoken in Gower had anything in common with the Flemish tongue.\" Mr. J. Jenkins observed, \" that it was indeed a remarkable fact that the people of Gower had preserved the English language for the last four or five hundred years, hemmed in as they were from any communication with those who spoke the same language. Supposing for an instant that the Flemish theory was the correct solution to that interesting phenomenon, he could not see how the fact of the English language stiU prevailing, could be accounted for, without some continually existing cause for keeping it up. They should remember that the very small population of Gower"], [116, "102 was surrounded by a large population speaking the Welsh tongue, and if the Gower language was really derived from Flanders, he should have thought, that in the nature of things, it would either have been totally lost, or have presented some traces of inter mixture with the AVelsh language \u2014 traces of which, he believed, were not to be found \u2014 for it was a fact, that the English dialect spoken in Gower was as pure as the Lancashire, or any other dialect spoken in England. He treated altogether as absurd the tradition that a colony of Flemings had been sent during the Norman dynasty for the purpose of keeping the AVelsh in check : but he also, to some extent, differed from those who sided with the view that they were descended from the Norman retainers, because in the present language of Gower they had no evidence of either Norman or Flemish origin.\" After pointing out the pecu liarity of the geographical position of Gower, Mr. Jenkins went on to contend, \" that from time immemorial there had been a constant traffic carried on between the people on the opposite side of the channel and the Gower and Pembrokeshire coast for lime found on this latter coast ; and that when families settled there, the Somersetshire people found it to their interest to carry the rich products of their farms across to the newly found colony. He had made a glossary of about one hundred and fifty Gower words, and had compared them with the Somersetshire dialect, and found that they were very similar, and in some cases exactly the same. The word ' delve ' was constantly used for ' dig ; ' the peculiarities ofthe nominative for the subjective case as 'told we' for ' told us,' was always used by a Gower man. The stiU more remarkable use of the 'z' for the 's,' and the 'v' for the 'f,' and the ' hold un ' instead of ' hold it, or him,' were only a few of the similarities with the dialect used in Somersetshire. He, therefore, contended that the Gower language neither originated with the Flemings nor Normans, but was an offshoot from the opposite coast of Somersetshire.\" Mr. Freeman replied : \" Sir, it is too late to continue the present discussion to any great length, but I do not think we can allow our good friends the Flemings to be turned out of Gower without some stronger arguments than have been brought by the gentlemen on the other side. I will not speak dogmatically on the point. I do not know that there is any distinct historical evidence, and it is one of those matters which there is only one in"], [117, "103 the kingdom really fitted to decide. I need do no more than mention Dr. Guest.\" Mr. Francis : \" It may save some trouble to say that I asked Dr. Guest about the people in Gower, and he said, tbat so far as a hasty visit enabled him to judge the people were not Flemings.\" Mr. Freeman : \" On Dr. Guest's authority I am quite ready to believe that the people of Gower are not Flemish ; but that leaves the arguments of Dr. Williams and Mr. Jenkins exactly where they were. Their arguments turned entirely on the identity of the population of Gower and South Pembrokeshire ; on their theory the two stand or fall together. But if Dr. Guest is right in denying the Flemish language in Gower, the cases of Gower and Pembrokeshire are at once separated. For the Flemish settlement in Pembrokeshire is a historical fact, resting on evi dence which even Dr. Guest's authority could not upset. Roger of Hoveden is the only author who I can quote at the present moment, but I know he does not stand alone, distinctly refers to the settlement of the Flemings in terra qu\u0153 nominatur Rhos, that is beyond aU doubt the modern Hundreds of Rhos and Castlemartin in Pembrokeshire. The speakers on the other side have treated a Flemish occupation as something ridiculous ; as if the Flemings were thought to have crossed the sea, no one knows how, and to have turned up in some unaccountable fashion on the coast of South AVales. Nothing of the kind : a Flemish colony settled in England, having left their own country because of an inundation. King Henry I. planted them first in the North of England, and afterwards removed them into the land of Rhos. Nothing can be more definite, intelligible, and straightforward than the whole history of the Flemish settlement in Pembroke shire. But I know of no such distinct authority for the Flemish settlement in Gower : that rests entirely on tradition, and on the analogy of Pembrokeshire, and, therefore, on Dr. Guest's authority I am quite ready to give it up. Dr. Williams and Mr. Jenkins teU us, that the Teutonic inhabitants of Gower and Pembrokeshire are simply Englishmen, of the same stock as the West Saxons of Somersetshire and Devon. Their remarks seemed almost to imply, that they supposed Gower and Rhos were settled by the same immigration which settled Somersetshire and Devon. Now the first English occupation of any part of Somersetshire was by Ceawlin, after the battle of Dearham, in 577. It is an occupation"], [118, "104 which specially concerns me, as the limits of Ceawlin's conquest exactly coincide in one part with the limits of my own property, so that I live in the AVest Wales of 577. Do the gentlemen on the other side of the room believe that Ceawlin, or his followers, occupied Gower and Rhos in 577 ? Do they, without going so far as that, believe that Gower and Rhos were Teutonised by Ina, or any other of the West Saxon Kings, who helped to spread the English name and language westwards ? If so, they are carrying the Teutonic settlements in South Wales backward to a far earUer date than anybody ever thought of before, and are putting the question on a wholly new ground. And what are the arguments by which the Teutonic inhabitants \u2014 be they Flemings or be they English \u2014 are speciaUy connected with Somersetshire ? They speak, we are told, the same dialect of English. I cannot say that they do not, but the arguments of the speakers on the other side certainly do not prove that they do. Those gentlemen seem to me to have fallen into the common error of compilers of local grammars and glossaries, that of setting down as peculiarities of their own district, whatever differs from common literary English. Constantly in such works we see words and forms put down as localisms of this or that country, which are sometimes merely archaisms, sometimes forms common to that country with many others. AATe are told that the Gower people say \" delve \" instead of \"dig.\" Why should they not? AU England did so a few centuries back. 'AVhen Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman.' The Gower people and the Somersetshire people are said to agree in a few contractions of the personal pronouns. They say ' he ' for ' him,' so they do in Gloucestershire, and I dare say in other counties besides. They say ' a ' for ' I ' or for ' he.' Now what was the last thing that Falstaff did ? AVhy, ' A babbled of green fields,' and yet neither Falstaff nor Dame Quickly were born in Gower or Somersetshire. The English of Gower and the Enghsh of Somersetshire may be specially akin ; but the examples cited by Dr. Williams and Mr. Jenkins certainly prove nothing. We are asked again, how the Flemings have dropped their own language, and adopted the English ? I answer, that they never did drop it. Flemish and English are even now closely aUied languages ; both are dialects of the same low Dutch tongue ;"], [119, "105 whole sentences of the one are even now intelligible, with very little effort, to those who understand the other. Flemish, in short, is very much what English would have been had no Norman conquest brought an infusion of French or Latin into English. If Flemish and English are even now so closely akin, what were they in the twelfth century ? What were they in the sixth, if we are to go back so far as the Teutonic settlement in Gower ? I myself see no difficulty whatever iu accepting the common tradi tion as to the inhabitants of Gower, while the Flemish occupation of Rhos is a certain historical fact. If, therefore, I at aU surrender the Flemish origin of Gower, it is not that I am in the least convinced by the arguments of the gentlemen on the other side, but solely out of deference to the authority of Dr. Guest.\" Mr. Stephens said, \" He had Ustened with attention to the remarks of Dr. Williams, and he could not help feeling surprised when he found, that in the whole of his address, there was not a single fact mentioned, nor any attempt made to substantiate the assertions of the speaker by proofs of any kind. The address was simply a series of unsupported assertions. The second address contrasted advantageously with it in this respect. Mr. Jenkins urged several facts in support of the same suggestion, though it might fairly be doubted whether more than one of these facts was strictly relevant to the inquiry. He was surprised at the manner in which Dr. Williams referred to the Flemings, when he ignored all the well known historic statements on the subject of their settlement on the opposite coast of Pembroke, and treated the assertion of their connection with the district as a mere vague tradition, that a ship from Flanders had strayed from its course and stranded on the coast of Gower. It seemed to be admitted on both sides, that the Enghsh speaking people of Gower, and the Enghsh speaking people of Pembroke, had many points of resemblance to each other, which at the same time distinguished them in each district from the adjoining population. They were strikingly aUke in personal appearance ; they resembled each other in the peculiarities of their speech, in the decoration of their houses, in their dress\u2014 the red whittles, &c, being char acteristic of each. The problem submitted for solution was, therefore, exactly the same in both cases ; and it might be assumed that whatever would be a proof in the one case, would equally apply in the other. He held that in both cases, the people o"], [120, "106 were originally Flemings. AVith regard to Pembrokeshire, this admitted of most conclusive proof; for there was no fact in history better authenticated than the establishment of a colony of Flemings in the southern and western parts of Pembrokeshire.\" Mr. Stephens added \u2014 \" The first settlement is said to have been effected in the early part of the twelfth century ; and in a Welsh chronicle MS., B. of Brut-y-Tywgsogion, considered to have been written at the end of the thirteenth century, the fact is duly recorded.\" Mr. Stephens then read a statement from the folio edition of \" PoweU's History of Wales,\" to the effect \" That in the year 1106, owing to an inundation in Flanders, large numbers of Flemings came to England ; that Henry I. sent them to Pem- brokeshire, and under the protection of Norman Lords, already in possession of parts of that country, they there effected a settlement.\" Mr. Stephens then went on to say, \"This statement is supported by several contemporaneous Monkish chroniclers, such as AViUiam of Malmsbury, Florence of Worcester, and others. The former of these relates the event in these terms, under the year 1106. 'The Welsh perpetuaUy rebeUing, were subjugated by the King in repeated expeditions, who, relying on a prudent expedient to queU their tumults, transported hither aU the Flem- ings then resident in England. For that country contained such numbers of these people, who, in the time of his father, had come over from national relationship to his mother ; * that from their numbers they appeared burdensome to the kingdom. In con- sequence, he settled them, with aU their property and connections, at Ross, a AVelsh province, as a common receptacle, both for the purpose of cleansing the kingdom, and repressing the brutal temerity of the enemy.' Ross is of course Rhos, in Pembroke shire, and as AViUiam died in 1143, he was in a position to know the actual facts. Again, King Stephen brought over large numbers of Flemish soldiers. These, in 1155, were dispersed by Henry II. ; and the Welsh chronicles state, that these also were sent to Pembrokeshire. Giraldus Cambrensis, a native of that country, and, therefore, weU able to know the actual facts, writing in 1188, not only speaks of a Flemish settlement there, but affirms them to have been remarkable for their skiU and industry. Again, the Welsh chronicles UteraUy abound with references to * Maud, daughter of Baldwin, Earl of Flanders."], [121, "107 the Flemings of Pembrokeshire. Notices of this kind will be found both in the original Welsh MSS., and in the Enghsh History of Powell, as weU as in Williams' (qy. Owen's) recent edition of Brut-ij-Tywysogion, under the years 1105, 1107, 1112, 1113 (twice), 1135, 1145, 1158, 1165, 1187, 1194, 1216, 1220. It must, therefore, be perfectly clear, that there is an overwhelm- ing amount of evidence proving the settlement of a colony of Flemings in Pembrokeshire. This point being established, it becomes a very easy matter to account for the occurrence of Flemings in Gower. If the views of Mr. Jenkins and Dr. WiUiams be correct, viz., that the English of Gower came from Somersetshire, they ought to be found on the southern side, or that next to Somerset and Devon ; but the fact seems quite the contrary, especially in considering the names of the people. The greater part of the names on the south side are Welsh, being Bevan, Beynon, Lewis, Griffiths, Thomas, Eynon, &c. On the contrary, the English parts of Gower are the northern, namely those nearest to Pembrokeshire. They might have easily crossed from Pembroke to Gower. If they did we should naturally look for them on the northern and north-western side ; and there in fact we find them. Nor are we left to depend upon conjecture alone in support of this opinion. It is stated in the Welsh Chronicles, relating to the year 1135, that in a hard fought battle at Aberdyfi, the Flemings and Normans were defeated with immense loss by the sons of Griffith ap Kynan and Griffith ap Rhys. Numbers of them were slain, many were drowned, many were trodden to death, and large numbers fled away. Many of them, it is said in a Chronicle called the' ' Chronicle of Caradoc,' properly the ' Book of Aberpergwm,' attempted to escape to England ; but they were met in the Vale of Neath ; three thousand of them were slain, and the remnant driven back, took refuge in Gower, under the protection of the castles of Henry Beaumont.\" * Coming next to the philological argument of Mr. Jenkins, the speaker said, \" That most of the words cited in proof were not peculiar to Somersetshire, but prevailed throughout aU England. The only seeming case in point was the use of ' z ' instead of ' s ' or ' c ' in some words, as cider ; but this was not quite conclusive, * Alias Henry de Newburgh, Earl of Warwick."], [122, "108 as the Flemings were generally hired soldiers, and doubtless many of them might have been retainers in Somersetshire, as well as elsewhere. Indeed, the fact itself had been disputed, that 'z' was thus used in Gower ; but admitting this, might it not be a Flemish characteristic ? The following had been reported as a bit of genuine Pembrokeshire English : \u2014 ' I'ze a gwaaing to zell zum vish to buy zum vlesh for that blessed day Zoonday.' But was not this a genuine trace of Flemish ? The broad sound of the vowels was certainly common in Pembrokeshire. It was very visible even on the maps of the Netherlands, HoUand, &c. We had the 'z' in Zutphen, Zwolle, &c, and most of the persons had heard of the prayer of Mynheer ATan Dunck, \u2014 ' O that a Dutchman's draught could be Deep as the rolling Zuyder Zee.' For these reasons, notwithstanding the authority of Dr. WiUiams, and even of Dr. Guest, Mr. Stephens was stUl of opinion that the English speaking people of Pembrokeshire and Gower were originaUy Flemish.\" \"Mr. Moggridge acquiescing in the views of Mr. Freeman and Mr. Stephens, was unable to understand how the direct testi mony of undoubted history could be set aside as regards the Flemish occupation of Pembrokeshire at least. As respected Gower, he could, from his own experience, bring forward a remarkable confirmation, that the inhabitants of that district also were of the same stock. During the late Russian war, he was engaged swearing in recruits, when a man \u2014 a perfect specimen of the Gower type \u2014 presented himself, and stated that he was an Irishman. Owing to his exact resemblance to the inhabitants of Gower, he disbelieved him, and thought he had some private object in concealing the truth. He took, therefore, an oppor tunity of questioning him privately, and on his (Mr. Moggridge) stating he was sure he had no Irish blood, the man immediately said, ' I never said I had Irish blood, though my family and people have been settled in Ireland ever so many hundred years ; but we are Flemings.' And on inquiry, he found there was such a colony estabhshed in the southern part ofthe County of Cork.\" With these remarks of Mr. Moggridge, this interesting debate terminated. It wiU be seen from the foregoing discussion, that Mr. Freeman and Mr. Stephens were disposed to believe in a Flemish settlement"], [123, "109 in Gower ; and their remarks on this point are of a very decided and convincing nature ; while the arguments of those on the other side \u2014 unsupported by any facts \u2014 amount to nothing more than an opinion, grounded upon certain puzzling features in the case, and to account for these, they gave that solution which appeared to them most likely to be correct and ready to hand. They simply spoke as those who were evidently unaware that there existed any positive evidence, or even indications, of the Flemish origin of the Gower people. The English language was to them the great difficulty, and the prevalence of this was fatal to the idea tbat the present inhabitants could be Flemings. If they were Flemings they ought to speak Flemish still ; but as they did not at the present day speak low Dutch, therefore they could not be the people of Flanders. Mr. Freeman, however, as already stated, promptly met this argument, and at once over threw the objection on this ground. Again, it may be asked, how have the Pembrokeshire people ceased to speak Flemish ? Seeing that, at least as far as they are concerned, their settling in that county is so clearly a matter of history, that no doubt whatever can be entertained about it ; and tbe closest examination of the language they now speak would probably show that it is as free from any Flemish element as that spoken in the peninsula of Gower. It must also be borne in mind, that it is now nearly eight hundred years since the Flemings, speaking a language Uttle differing from the old Anglo- Saxon, came into these parts, and that during that time the English tongue has undergone great modifications; and if those persons who object to the Flemish colonization of this district could be confronted with their Saxon ancestors of 500 years back they would find it a hard matter to understand each other, with out the aid of an interpreter. Let any one for instance take up the Saxon Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester, temp. Henry III., or Robert of Brunne's Anglo-Saxon version of Peter Langtoft, temp., Edward I., and he would see the language of his country before him in such guise, that I venture to say he would not comprehend six consecutive fines of either of those works ; and he would quickly perceive that his countrymen of those days spoke a language \" Not now understanded of the people.\" And if the English tongue in the thirteenth century was so unlike the present standard, what must it have been when Hengist and"], [124, "110 Horsa brought over their Saxon hosts to the island of Britain. The argument, therefore, founded on the score of the absence of the Flemish element in the vernacular of the present inhabitants of Gower has little weight, and its disappearance is satisfactorily accounted for. Professor Max Mulier, speaking of the changes which have taken place in various languages, says, \u2014 \" The language of Alfred is so different from the Enghsh of the present day that we have to study it in the same manner as we study Greek and Latin. We can read Milton and Bacon, Shakespeare and Hooker ; we can make out Wycliffe and Chaucer ; but when we come to the Enghsh of the thirteenth century we can but guess its meaning, and we fail even in this with works previous to Orm and Layamon.\" \u2014 Vide \" Science of Language,\" Sixth Ed. 1871, vol. i., p. 36. The other objection from the supposed absence of any direct historical evidence as to the Gower people being Flemings, was met by Mr. Stephens' happy quotation from the book of Aber pergwm. Caradoc, in his \" History of Wales,\" indirectly alludes to the Gower Flemings, and Wilkins, in his book on \"Wales, Past and Present,\" pub. 1870, brings this forward as a very strong proof that this place was peopled by them. After speaking of the various points of resemblance between the people of Pem broke and those of Gower, he says : \u2014 \" The second argument proving Gower to have been peopled by the Flemings, and this also we believe has not been previously noted, is to our mind most conclusive : \u2014 \"In 1150 Cadell, eldest son of Griffith ap Rhys, Prince of South Wales, was out hunting in the neighbourhood of Tenby, and though in a time of peace, he was assailed by the Flemings, and barely escaped with life.\" Caradoc states \u2014 \" That the in habitants of Tenby had conceived some displeasure of him, and resolving to revenge themselves, laid a trap for his life. In retaliation, his brothers, Meredith and Rhys, passed with an army into Gwyr (Gower), and having burnt and destroyed the country thereabout, they besieged and took the castle of Aberbychwyn, but, finding they could not keep it, they razed it to the ground and returned with great booty to Dinevor.\"\u2014\" Hist. Wales,\" pp. 170-1. Commenting on this Mr. Wilkins says,\u2014 \"As the colonies settled in Pembroke were numerous and strong, it foUowed that the young chieftains retaliated on the lesser colony of Gower, and"], [125, "111 in so doing affords us presumptive evidence that the Flemings, closely aUied, inhabited both districts.\" Having already alluded to the objection of Mr. Hartshorne, F.S.A., on the ground of the non-existence of Flemish architecture, and Sir Gardner Wilkinson's reply, it is unnecessary to re-intro duce it here. I may, however, mention that the chimney stack and conventual buildings at Monkton, Pembrokeshire \u2014 which are undoubtedly Flemish \u2014 correspond in a remarkable way to the tall chimney stack, and similar buildings at Cheriton, Gower, drawings of which will be given in my notices of that parish. I should also add, that in the year 1874, while the workmen were taking down a portion of the south waU of the nave of Cheriton Church, they found a brass Flemish token. An old house, called the \" Court House,\" in the parish of liston, was the place where in former days, as the old people say, they held the Flemish Court. A very strong resemblance may be seen in the faces painted by Teniers in the old Flemish pictures to those of the present inhabitants of Gower.* The identity of the people of Gowrer with those of Pembroke shire is so striking, that being in the town of Pembroke a few years ago, I could not discover the slightest difference between them. It was impossible to help recognising the fact, that they were one and the same people. Had I not been aware that I was at Pembroke, I should have imagined, from hearing the people speak, that I was back again in Gower. The following story, bearing upon this point, I had from Mr. George Jenkins, miUer, of Cheriton. Having occasion a few years since to require some new iron castings for his miU, he went with a friend \u2014 also a Gower man \u2014 to Neath to purchase them : having to wait a considerable time there, they went into the town to obtain some refreshments. After looking about for a homely inn where they could make themselves comfortable, Mr. J. espied the sign of the \" House of Lords,\" and having taken the measure of the place in his mind as one likely to suit, he and his companion entered. After conversing a little while together, the landlord, who was present, and had been remarking their mode of speech, asked them if they were from Pembroke or * I am indebted to Mr. F. Williams, of Wind-street, Swansea, for calling my attention to this circumstance."], [126, "112 Gower, as he felt sure they must be from one or the other of those places from hearing them speak. Before we take our leave of the Gower Flemings, a few observations on a simdarity of customs between them and the Flemings of Pembrokeshire may be interesting. Giraldus Cambrensis, speaking of the Flemings of Pembroke shire, and remarking upon their industrious habits, mentions a most curious mode of divining by means of the blade bone of a ram. \" It is worthy of remark,\" he says, \" that these people (the Flemings), from the inspection of the right shoulder's of rams, which have been stripped of their flesh, and not roasted, but boUed, can discover future events, or those which have passed, and remained long unknown ; they know also what is transpiring at a distant place, by a wonderful art, and a prophetic kind of spirit ; they declare also by means of signs, the undoubted symptoms of approaching peace and war, murders and fires, domestic adulteries, the state of the King, his life and death.\" He then goes on to detad a most extraordinary story of the detection of a woman who was unfaithful to her husband, and who was herself, by an ingenious artifice of his, made to proclaim her own dishonour. \"The shoulder of a goat was also once brought to a certain person, instead of a ram's, both being alike when cleaned, who, observing for a short time the lines and marks, exclaimed, ' Unhappy cattle that never was multipUed ! unhappy likewise the owner of the cattle who never had more than three or four in one flock ! ' Many persons a year-and-a-half before the event, foresaw, by means of shoulder bones, the destruc tion of their country, after the decease of King Henry I., and seUing all their possessions, left their homes and escaped the impending ruin.\" Asking an old man in my employ if he had ever heard of this custom, he told me that he had, and that he well remembered when a small boy seeing his mother conjuring in this way by means of the blade bone of a sheep, and that as far as he could recollect, her method was to put the clean blade bone into the fire, and after taking it out she would then, with her finger and thumb, rap off the burned parts, and foreteU and discover many things. Several years ago, the people in Gower used to play a pecufiar game of cards, called \" Five Cards.\" I have ascertained that precisely the same game is known and played by the Pembrokeshire"], [127, "113 people, but differs entirely from that which goes by the same name in England and Ireland. As inquiries have frequently been made, if any Flemish names of families are to be found in Gower, I have taken the trouble of examining several of the old parish registers for this purpose, and beg to submit the following names, several of which, such as Givelin, Baldwin, Sambrook, Kyft, and Hortonk Van Klux, are decidedly Flemish, and many of the others may be, they are certainly neither Saxon nor Welsh. Dumonet (extinct). Givelin (some of this name Kyft (still represented). are still living in Bishop- Fraunce (extinct). stone and Oystermouth ; Dowde (extinct). they were once very nu- Gosse (extinct). merous in Gower). Voyle (extinct). Hullin (numerously repre- Baldwin (extinct). sensed). Ase or Ace (still represented). Sambrook (persons of this Hortonk Van Klux (extinct). name are to be found in Lunday (extinct). Swansea and Oystermouth). Dox (extinct). It is generally supposed that there were few men of any note among these colonists. They consisted chiefly of a multitude of workmen, artisans, and manufacturers \u2014 principally weavers, and Campbell in his political survey states that \" Rhos, the District allotted to them on their first admission into the country, may justly be considered to have been the cradle of our woollen manufactory.\" Many of the Gower people follow the trade of weaving still. There are factories at Llanrhidian, Cheriton, and Llangennith ; and at Bishopston there is a tucking mill. Besides these factories, where the motive power is a water wheel or steam, there are a great number of small looms which are worked by hand. The articles manufactured are whittles, bed quilts, coarse flannel, woollen stuffs, and some very neat cotton articles of wearing apparel. At a Parliament held at Nottingham, temp. Edward III., the Flemings were encouraged to settle in England. Capgrave, in his Chronicle of England, thus mentions it : \" And in this Parlement was ordeyned that able the cloth makeris of Flandres that wold dwell in Yngland should be welkom. For iii yere before that, was forbode the passage of wollis, because the pride of Flemingis shidd p"], [128, "114 be repressid, that set more prys be wolle-sakkes than be Englisch nien.\" It would seem from what the same author says elsewhere in his Chronicle about the Flemings, that they did not enjoy a good reputation in this country, and are styled by him \" The sals Flemings.\" \" In this same tyme* the sals Flemyngis took a barge of Fowey, which is in Cornwayle ; aud the men that were within schip thei killed, save o boy, that fled to one of the Flemysch shippes, and hid him in the horrok. The Flemingis com into Yngland for to selle the merchandise whech thei had take, the boy herd Englishmen speke and cried for help. Anon as he was pulled up, he told when thei took the schip be treson, pretending that thei were oure frendes, und thus killed all the men save him. So were the Flemynges take and sent to divers prisones.\" The AATelsh are greatly indebted to the Flemings for adding very considerably to the wealth and prosperity of their country. The rise and progress ofthe woollen manufactories may be said to be almost entirely due to them, and many other benefits besides. It is not, perhaps, generally known that the waU-flower, carnation, tulip, cabbage, lettuce, clover, and gooseberry were aU introduced into this country by the Flemings. One peculiarity in the language of the Gower people yet remains to be noticed, namely the French pronunciation of words ending in ious, such as precious, gracious, & c, which are invariably pronounced precieuse, gracieuse. This seems to be the result of that intimate connection which formerly existed between the Normans and Flemings. United by a common interest and danger, they were ever allies against their mutual enemies, the Welsh ; and it was partly to assist the Norman Barons, and to hold the natives in check, that Henry the First sent them into West Wales : an act dictated as much by motives of policy, as feelings of compassion, towards a people who had been forced from their own country by the inundation and destruction of their land by the overflowing of the sea. Since writing the above paper, or, I should say, supplementing what has been so well said by others on this subject, an article appeared in the Saturday Review of May 20th, 1876, in which the etymology of the name Tenby and the history of its Flemish inhabitants, and how they came to speak such good English, were \u00bb AD. 1379."], [129, "115 very ably treated. I was pleased to find that the writer gave precisely the same explanation of this latter question as Mr. Freeman and Mr. Stephens in the discussion at Swansea in 1861, fifteen years ago ; and it is to be hoped that after aU that has now been said on this point, namely, the difficulty in accounting for the people of Pembrokeshire and Gower speaking the English tongue will be disposed of, and we shall no longer be driven to the necessity of bringing over colonists from Devonshire and Somersetshire to explain this circumstance."], [130, "CHAPTER V. THE OCCUPATION OF GOWER BY THE ROMANS. Afi unavoidable delay in printing the first part of the History of West Gower, has enabled me to add a short paper on the above subject. Properly speaking this chapter \u2014 which is by accident the last \u2014 ought to have appeared in an earlier portion of the work. I had frequently thought over the subject of a Roman occupation of Gower, but deemed the materials too scanty, and the evidence insufficient to buUd up any satisfactory theory upon it ; but having lately had a conversation with Col. George Grant Francis, F.S.A., who brought before my notice the fact of the discovery of certain Roman relics at Swansea and Oystermouth, of which I was till then unaware, incUned me to think that what had been for some years to me a matter of suspicion only, might possibly turn out to be true. I have, therefore, in the foUowing pages endeavoured to answer the question which has been so frequently asked \u2014 \"Are there any good grounds for supposing that the Romans actuaUy occupied Gower \" ? I think we may venture to say that the probability seems greatly in favour of theh having done so, and is supported by the foUowing facts : \u2014 (1) The existence of a Roman Station at Lloughor. (2) Pottery and coins found near Swansea, and a tesseUated pavement at Oystermouth. (3) The discovery of a considerable quantity of Roman money lower down in the district than those places. AVe must not, however, place too much reliance upon the fact of the discovery of Roman coin as indisputable evidence of a Roman occupation, for according to a statement of GUdas, the historian, who wrote in the sixth century, no other kind of money but that stamped with the head of the Emperor was allowed to be circulated in Britain ; \u2014 \" Ita ut non Britania sed Romana insula censeretur, et quicquid habere potuisset, aris, argenti, vel auri, imagine C\u0153saris notaretur.\" Lloughor, the Leucarum of Antoninus, and the Leucaro mentioned by Richard of Cirencester, was a weU-known Roman"], [131, "117 station on the \" Via* Julia Maritima,\" which from Neath, (Nidum) another Roman station, passed westward through Lloughor, and therefore actually cutting through the north-east boundary of the peninsula. Many remains of undoubted Roman origin have been found at Lloughor. t \"A Roman altar stiU stands in the garden attached to the Rectory-house of that parish, and a stone supposed to be a miUiary some few years ago, formed the step of a stile leading up to it ; a brass coin of the Emperor Trajan was found in the bed of the river about two hundred yards to the west of the town ; and in the vicinity, on a common caUed Mynnyd Carn Goch, and near a place called Cadley, (the battle-field), there are traces of two small square camps of the weU-known Roman form, with the remains of an ancient water course, also supposed to be of Roman construction, by which water was conveyed from the smaU river Llyw to the castle, may be seen at the present day.\" Under the foundations of the Great AVestern Railway works at Lloughor were discovered distinct remains of the sudatorium of a bath, with its hoUow bricks, which by the care of Colonel Francis were preserved in situ, and arched over by the Company. It is hard to suppose that these people who occupied Britain for nearly som hundred years, and had one of their great main roads running through the upper part of Gower, over which troops and supplies must have been constantly passing, would have had no curiosity to inspect the lower portion of the peninsula, which they had in some sort already taken possession of, by the station established at Lloughor. I say such a supposi tion is so unlikely in itself, that wrhen we consider the ambition of the. Romans, and their love of conquest, together with such evidence of their presence in these parts, as may be gathered from the relics found at Lloughor, Swansea and Oystermouth, and to which we have to add the Roman silver money found at Lethrid,f in the heart of Gower, and scattered coins \u00a7 elsewhere in the * Generally attributed to Julius Frontinus circa A.D. 71. This road is sometimes known as the \" Barn Helen \" (Helen's pavement), and so called out of compliment to Helena, the mother of Constantine ; but the more rational origin of the name is Sarn-y- Ueng, i.e., the road of the legion, abbreviated into Sarn Helen. t Vide Lewis' Topographical Dictionary, under the head of Lloughor.

The next question to be considered is, what direction the Romans took in entering the Peninsula. Did they cross from Lloughor to Penclawdd, and so on by Llanrhidian ? Or did they, foUowing the Via Julia to Swansea, debouch there, and enter by that town and Oystermouth ? In discussing these points, it is necessary in the first place to bear in mind, that the Romans were great road makers ; wherever they went they invariably made the most substantial roads, re mains of which are to be seen at the present day, and often in a wonderful state of preservation. The Aria Julia was one of these, and from the stations at Caermarthen (Maridunmn), Lloughor (Lejcanmi), Neath (Nidum), Bovertem (Bovium), near Cow bridge, passed on to Caerwent (Venta Silurum), Lidney (Abona), and Gloucester (GlevumX The Romans were able engineers, and all their works were done in the most scientific manner, by proper officers trained and deputed for every branch of the pubUc service. AVith all our boasted improvements, we could have taught them little, and certainly nothing in the way of road making. AVith these preliminary remarks, we may assume, that what ever direction the soldiers of Julius Frontinus took in entering Gower, they were not long before they made a road into it, and the probability seems to be, that there was a vicinal way in connection with the main line, and leading from Swansea to Oystermouth, but all traces are lost, and no remains of any road, about which anything can be said for certain, have been met with westward of Swansea, and conducting to Gower. Colonel Evan Morgan, R.A., of St. Helen's, Swansea, who has given this part of the question much attention, kindly sent me the following communication ; \u2014 \" There is a tradition that a Roman reconoitering party traversed the course of Gower, and were stopped in going to Caennarthen by the river Llwchyr, they were told of a ford * at its estuary, but finding it impassable at that time, they went up the river in search of the next ford, which is Penclawdd, but as that was strongly fortified by the inhabitants, they proceeded to to the next nearest ford, Lloughor.\" Speaking of the road (the Via Julia) between this town and * Whitford, at the north end of Llanmadoc Burrows."], [133, "119 Neath, Colonel Morgan says,\u2014 \" The communication between these two places, according to tradition, was by the back of PenUergare, and above Morriston bridge, but on going over the ground, I felt satisfied this was an error, arising probably from a natural, but false supposition, that between two such towns the Romans would select the shortest distance ; had they done so, they would have avoided Swansea altogether. I then went back to Neath to endeavour to trace the old road. I followed the old road up the Skew-en hill ; about a mile from the top two roads meet, the one to the right communicated direct to Morriston bridge, and most decidedly was not an old ' one, the other I have every reason to think was then a Celtic track, and made use of by the Romans through Bonnemaen. After continuing three or four miles, it came to a spot called the Sarnau,* where som- roads met, thence on to Kilvey, where there are evident tokens of defensive earthworks, and descended to the river Tawey by an old track, which to this day bears the name of Heol Meuric, t and after crossing the ford, gave the name to a narrow street, which is now by corruption caUed ' Morris' Lane,' and supposed to have been so named from Robert Morris, Esq., who had a residence near it. At the Sarnau, one road led to Crumlin bog, the other to the river at Swansea, and would cross it at an old ford, half way between Swansea castle and Morriston bridge, but that bridge of course did not then exist, At Gwindy4 on this road, Roman coins were found. Now it appears to me, that the first I mentioned, leading over Kilvey through Morris' Lane, was an old track road connecting Swansea with the interior of the county, and that the road from Swansea, on which the coins were found, went direct to Lloughor. At the Beaufort Anns, about two mUes from Swansea, on the Caermarthen road, the Roman road branches off, one road to Caermarthen, the other to Lloughor, which latter anyone can see is a straight Roman road, and a continuation of that on which the coins were found, but which, about three quarters of a mile from the river, is lost among the collieries on * Sir Sam. Rush Meyrick, in his \"History of Cardiganshire,\" observes, that wherever the word Sarnau occurs, you may expect to meet with a Eoman road. t Heol Meuric is Welsh, and means Meuric's Lane, hence doubtless the corruption Morris* Lane. I For an account of the discovery of these coins, vide \u2022\u2022 Contributions towards a History of Swansea,\" by L. L. Dillwyn, Esq., M.P., F.R.S., p. 66."], [134, "120 the hiUs. With regard to a * vicinal way connecting Swansea and Oystermouth, I do not know what to say about it ; the direct communication between these two places in ancient times was along the sands, and if any such road exists would be found there.\" In constructing the lock at the upper end of the North Dock on the Tawey, Swansea, a regularly formed paved crossing was discovered. This work was carefully constructed of strong timber, wattled on its upper and lower sides, while the road within was packed with three horizontal layers of good sized boulders, upon which were laid, from bank to bank of the river, squared blocks of native sandstone. This roadway was in sound condition, and undoubtedly ancient, for it lay several feet below the then existing surface of the bed of the Tawey. From its systematic and excel lent construction, the engineers were of opinion that it was of Roman workmanship. It lay in the fair line of way from Gwindy to Lloughor ; and supposing the Via Julia ran from Nidum to Leucarum, across the KUvey range, this work might have been provided for the passage of the Tawey. To look for, or find existing evidence of roadways to and from this ford is now im possible, owing to its entire surface occupation by modern works and alterations of every kind. The foregoing account of this most interesting and remarkable old causeway I had from Col. G. G. Francis, who careftdly inspected it, and noted aU the details of its construction. Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Bart., F.R.S., FSA., in his edition of \" Giraldus' Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin,\" and in a foot note on p. 101, vol. i., speaking of the British roads (Sarnau), sub sequently caUed streets, \u2014 through Wales \u2014 says, \" The Ryknield street crossing the Severn at Gloucester, ran by Monmouth, Abergavenny, and Brecknock, through the middle of Wales ; whUe the Akeman-street, coming from Cirencester, passed the Severn near the Old Passage, and continued along the sea coast through Swansea, and both terminated at St. David's. There is, therefore, every probability that the road traced by Colonel Morgan, and on which the coins were found, is a portion of the celebrated Akeman-street, the course of which has been so care fully laid down by Sir R. C. Hoare in his map of Wales, before and after the invasion of the Romans. Vide p. 141, vol. i. of the \" Itinerary of Giraldus.\""], [135, "121 It is a fact that should be borne in mind, that the \" Via Julia Maritima \" was formed on the track of the British \" Akenian Street,\" just as the \" Via Julia Montana \" was on that of the \"Ryknield Street\"; both these roads joined at Caermarthen (Maridunum), and thence formed one road to St. David's (Menevia). The singular trackway of stones laid in the form that is locally termed \"pitching,\" and leading from the south side of Harding's Down across the flat boggy part of Rhosili Down, is wrell worth attention, and I should be glad if some one who is weU acquainted with the character and construction of the genuine Roman road would give an opinion upon it. There are many paved roads in Gower, evidently of ancient date, but they are generaUy very narrow, and are probably the work of the natives of the country in former days; there is no reason, as far as I know, for supposing them to be Roman. As time rolls on, we may expect that other interesting facts and additional infor mation will be brought to bear upon the Roman occupation of Gower. The soil, doubtless, stiU holds many buried treasures, which some happy chance may yet bring to light. I should mention that the discovery of the tesser\u00e6 at Oyster mouth wras as foUows. At the rebufiding and enlargement of the parish church, during the incumbency of the late vicar, the Rev. Saml. Davies, M.A., it was resolved to drain the south side. On removing the accumulated soil there, a tesseUated floor was met with, bedded in a basis of concrete gravel. It was, by the workmen, soon broken to pieces ; some portions of the tesser\u00e6 were put aside, which, having been sent to Col. Francis, that good antiquary caused them to be set into a tablet of slate, and secured against the west wall of the nave with a suitable in scription, thus preserving for future generations a record of much interest in connection with the Roman occupation of the Peninsula of Gower.

The plan of this Church (the smallest in Gower) is of the plainest description, consisting of a nave, chancel, and saddle-back tower at the western end. The probable date of the present struc ture is the 1 3th century. Much of the south side of the nave, with a portion of the upper part of the tower, and the greater part of the east wall of the chancel, being in a very decayed and loosened condition, had to be taken down and rebuilt when the Church was restored in the years 1865 and '66. A new window* was then in serted in the east end of the chancel, and another in the south side of the nave. There are no windows on the north side, but in scraping off the whitewash and plaster, two round headed, blocked up apertures were met with. A new porch was also built at the same time, replacing a former one (modern), but con structed in such bad taste that the architect was compeUed to remove it. The ancient Holy Water stoup was found by me in a garden in the village, but whether it had been fixed in the porch, or within the Church, there were no means of knowing. The restoration was carried out from plans prepared by Mr. John Prichard, of Llandaff, and the Church was re-opened for service on the 26th of April, 1866. These saddle-back roofs, and the decidedly military character of the towers, are the peculiar feature of the Gower Churches. At Llanmadoc the gables are connected by an overhanging parapet, supported by a number of rude small red sandstone corbels. In the present instance the roof takes the direction of the Church ; but at Llandewi and Rhosilfi it is transverse to it, and runs north and south. * The original window was a single trefoil ligbt.\u2014 Vide \" Notes on tbe Architectural Antiquities of the Gower Churches,\" by Mr. Ed. Freeman, F.S.A. B"], [142, "2 The opening on the north side of the wall, dividing the nave from the chancel, is the entrance to the Rood Loft, sometimes called the \"Jube,\" a sort of gaUery, which, in former days, stretched across the Church, immediately above the chancel arch, and supported what is caUed the \" Holy Rood,\"* generally of large dimensions, and frequently accompanied by figures of Our Lady and St. John on either side. The representations of the Rood, placed over the screen dividing the nave from the chancel, conveyed to om- ancestors the full type of the Christian Church, the nave representing the Church militant, and the chancel the Church triumphant, denoting that all who would go from the one to the other must pass under the Rood, that is, carry the Cross and suffer affliction. It was from this place the Epistle and Gospel were usually read in pre-reformation times, access being obtained by a staircase. There is, however, one feature which it is necessary to explain here : it wdl be seen that the bottom part of this aperture in the wall is considerably below the top of the chancel arch. It was not so much so originally, as will be seen by Mr. Freeman's drawing, made in 1850. But when the Church was being restored, it was found that the soil had accumulated to such an extent in the Churchyard, that it was at least four feet higher than the level inside the Church. The floor had therefore to be raised, the consequence of which was to diminish the height of the entrance into the chancel so much, that it became necessary to raise the crown of the arch ; but the entrance to the Rood Loft not being interfered with, this now appears much lower down than it ought to be. There is good reason for believing that Rood Lofts are not an especially old feature, at least in England, and that as articles of Church furniture, they do not go further back than the 12th or 13th centuries, the date of nearly all the old Gower churches. They would, therefore, be put up at the time when the churches were built, and the remains of the stone corbels (which carried the main beam) stiU existing at Cheriton, Llangennith, and here, untU they were removed when the Church was restored, serve to show that the Roods were made when the buUdings were erected. * The old name of the Crucifix : from the Anglo-Saxon '* Rode.' t Vide \" Brand's Popular Antiquities.\""], [143, "3 An aged man (Christopher Lewis), who died in his 90th year\u2014 formerly the parish clerk \u2014 told me that the opening was caUed by the old people of his remembrance, \" The Pillory Hole,\" and that offenders against the Church were made to do penance by standing in this hole, clothed in a white sheet, during service time. It is not at all unlikely that these places were put to such uses after the Rood Lofts were removed, as there are many in stances of persons having been made to undergo the discipline of public penance, standing openly in the Church, until comparatively recent times.

By an order in Council dated 30th of January, 1868, the Rectories of Cheriton and Llanmadoc were consolidated, and are consequently now one Benefice. This order took effect on the 6th of February of that year, being the date of its deposit in the Diocesan Registry of Caermarthen. The Church is dedicated to St. Madoc, of whom Iolo Morganwg has the foUowing notices: \u2014 \" St. Madoc, the son of Gildas of Coed Aur, (the Golden Grove,) who was of St. Cenydd's College,* and whose Church is Llanmadoc, in Gower.\" In Ireland he is called St. Mogue, also known as Aidus, Aedd, and Aidanus. Brown WiUis, in his History of St. David's, A.D. 1716, speak ing of this Church, says: \u2014 \"Llanmadoc, R. St. Madocus. Patron, The Crown.\" The present edifice being, as stated, of the 13th century, it is not therefore to be inferred that there was no Church here pre vious to that time; for St. Madoc being a contemporary of SS. Cenydd and David, the latter of whom died A.D. 542, there is every reason to believe that St. Madoc \u2014 who, according to Iolo, received at least a part of his education in the College at Llan gennith \u2014 founded a Church here in the 6th century. This was doubtless a very homely structure, in accordance with other rude buildings of that early period, and shared the fate of ita sister Church at Llangennith, being burnt by the Danes in the 9th cen tury, to be restored again in more peaceful times. Many successive buildings have been raised on the old founda tions of this Church, partaking more or less of the character of the times, and graduaUy assuming the complete and perfect type which we find in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. We may therefore safely venture to say, that a Church has existed here, on the same old site, for more than twelve hundred years. In connection with the history of this Church we must not forget to mention The Mapsant, A very ancient festival, kept on a certain day every year, in honour of the patron saint of the Parish Church. The religious character * At Llangennith. Some account of this College will be given in the notices of the Parish of Llangennith."], [147, "7 of this commemoi-ation has been lost sight of, and it has long since degenerated into a kind of revel ; in this form it is still kept up. Besides the amusements of fiddling and dancing, which are customary on these occasions, one peculiar feature of the Llan madoc Mapsant was, and is still, a particular sort of pie, made of chopped mutton and currants. According to an old Gower cus tom, every farmer endeavoured to sow his wheat on- or before Llanmadoc Mapsant, for the old people used to say that whatever was sown after then would he in the ground forty days before it began to spring. William of Worcester, in his Itinerary, puts St. Madoc's Day on the 31st of January: \u2014 \" Sanctus Medocus epis copus et confessor ultimo die Januarii.\"* It is, however, kept here, on the 12th of November. The word Mapsant is Welsh, and means, according to Owen, \" the Patron Saint,\" or tutelary Saint of a Church ; some Welsh scholars, however, render it \" the memory of the Saint.\" There were scarcely any of the early British Saints, not ex cepting even SS. Patrick and David, who enjoyed a much greater notoriety than St. Madoc. A high eulogium is paid to his learning and eloquence by Bede, and he is frequently alluded to by the Church Historians of the middle ages. The Rev. William Reeves, D.D., in a paper read before the Royal Irish Academy, A.D. 1863, thus explains the singular variations in this Saint's name : \u2014 \" St. Mcedoc, commonly called St. Mogue. \" The simple form of this name is Aedh, or Aodh,| which signi fies fire, and when borrowed into other languages, becomes Aeda, Aidus, Aiduus, \u00c6deus, Edus, Hugh. With the diminutive ter mination an, it becomes Aedhan, modified into Aedan, Aedanus Aidanus, Edanus, Aidan. The same root, when mo} (my) is prefixed, and the syllable oe or og denoting little, or dear, is suffixed, assumes the form Mo-aedh-og, which is contracted into Moedoc, and according to the ordinary changes, becomes Maedoc, Maedoce, M'aodog ; in Latin, Modocus, Maidocus, and in English, Maidoc, Modoche, Modock. Madoes, Mogue. By this process, two names so dissimilar in sound as Edh and Mogue, are proved to be * Vide Itinerarium Willelmi de Worcestre, p. 164. Nasmith's ed. t Irish. Irish, Irish,"], [148, "8 identical.\" . Dr. Reeves, following the Irish chroniclers, states. that he died on the 31st of January, A.D. 625. There is no record of his ever having visited Scotland, though his memory was vividly preserved in that country. The Breviary of Aberdeen notices him in the \" Proprium Sanctorum,\" at Jan. 31st, as \" Sancticus Modocus epyscopus et confessor eximius apud Kilmodock ;\" but despatches his commemoration with a short collect. Leland notices him as Aidanus, \" qui Hibernice Maydauc dicitur, & Ismael Davidis discipuli.\" Vide Collect., vol. 3, p. 107. The Welsh have a lively recollection of him as Aeddan Foeddog, son of Caw. When a young man he became acquainted with St. David, who had a great love for him, and venerated him highly for his great sanctity. According to Iolo Morganwg, it would appear that he received at least a part of his education in St. Cennyd's CoUege, at Llangennith, in Gower. He eventuaUy became Bishop of Ferns, in Ireland, and founded the Cathedral there. There are several legendary accounts of the life of this Saint, and the particulars relating to his birth, studies, travels, mis sionary zeal, miracles, learning, and eloquence, &c, embellished here and there by the imagination of his monkish biographers, are of a most extraordinary description. Out of the many legendary notices preserved, I venture to give that transcribed by the Rev. W. J. Rees, M.A., F.S.A., from the Cotton MSS. in the British Museum, which is certainly as remarkable and quaintly enter taining as any that I have hitherto met with. LIFE OF ST. AIDUS.* Here heginneth the Life of St. Aidus,^ Bishop LL. of the Calends of March. There was a certain nobleman in the province of Connaught, of the name of Sedia, who had a wife of the name of Eithne, of the seed of Amolaida, of the descendants of the Maccnates. This man and his wife not having offspring, came to some religious persons who dwelt at Driumlethan, and asked them to pray to the Lord Christ on account of their barrenness. Then those reUgious * Vide Rev. W. J. Rees's \"Lives of the Cambro-British Saints,\" p. .54. t Alias Madoc. Vide Dr. Reeves' account and explanation."], [149, "9 persons besought the Lord of Heaven that he would grant to them the conception of a good son. And they said to them, \" Go in the name of the Lord.\" And they did so, and the following night the man Sedia saw a white star falling from Heaven on the mouth of his wife Eithne ; and she also in a vision, saw a bright moon falling on his. And when they awakened they told each other what they had seen ; and after some interval, their dreams were fulfilled, by God granting their petition. And the woman that was barren conceived a son full of the Grace of God and of miracles, as is shown in his life ; for before he wras born, when the mother of St. Aidus was riding in a chariot, nigh to a council of her people, a certain magician who heard the sound of the chariot said, \" That chariot sounds either under a King, or under the Grace of God \" \u2014 that is, because he was then in the womb of his pregnant mother. And St. Aidus was born on the island of Brercimaige, and in that island light has not been wanting to the present day. There was also a great king, Ammerus, who was hard-hearted to the common people who were subject to him, and had hostages of theh sons. And fifty-three boys were delivered to him, and Aidus was one of them. Then Aidus came on his hands to the King, and King Ammerus seeing him, said, \" That is my boy, he shall come to my part.\" To whom the boy said, \"If thou wilt defend me, 0 King, defend the other boys with me.\" Then the boy Aidus delivered himself and fifty-three boys from the power of the King ; and afterwards he liberated the Kings of Connaught. At another time the same holy boy, Aidus, was a keeper of sheep, and looked after eight sheep and eight wethers ; and on a certain day, when Aidus saw eight very hungry wolves coming he had pity on them, so that they might eat the wethers, and imme mediately the hungry wolves devoured them. After a short interval, when the boy saw bis aunt, that is the sister of his mother, coming to him, he feared her on account of the wethers, and called to the Lord, saying \" Lord assist me.\" And the Lord heard the prayers of the holy boy, and sent eight wethers to the eight sheep, as they had been before. And on a certain time the aforesaid religious persons asked the Lord if he would show them the place of their resurrection ; and an angel came to them and said, \" A holy boy who resides with you, named Aidus, will show c"], [150, "10 you the place of your resurrection.\" Then they asked the boy, who said to them, \" Come with me,\" arid he led them through the thick woods, and put them in the place of their resurrection, and showed them the place. Also the holy boy Aidus read in the fields with a loud voice, and in that hour a certain hunter quickly pursued with dogs a stag in those fields. Then the stag being weary in its journey, and hearing the voice of the boy, turned to him, and asking for assistance from him, feU on its knees to the ground before him, and St. Aidus put his book on its horns and read ; and the dogs running about could not see the stag, which accordingly escaped uninjured. Also, on another day, St. Aidus and St. Molasus, who were companions, were reading in one place, and agreed with each other to travel, but they did not know where they should go ; and in that hour there were before them two large sticks, and then, inspired by God, they said to those sticks, \" In the name of the Lord reveal to us what we shall do, and show what is to be for us.\" And immediately those two sticks fell to the ground, one northwards and the other southwards, and thereby they understood that one of them, that is, Molassus, should go southwards, to the island of Bourn ; and Aidus to the right, to the borders of the Laginensians. Again, on another day, when the holy boy Aidus was on the mountain which is caUed Betho Mountain, at the end of the day, he would go to the place where Aired Siniuch dwelt. Then angels came to him, and taking him up in their hands, brought him to the place, and dismissed him near the cross, in the middle of the castle, before night came on. And at another time there was a certain boy, near the pool Eruc, named Bosargente, the son of Echbach, mother of Oruntham, and that boy and two others with him, were drowned in the bottom of the pool. Then the mother, that is of the aforesaid boy, lamenting, went round to aU the holy persons, requesting them to raise up her son for her. And she came to St. Molassus, who said to her, \" Go and wait near the pool in which thy son is drowned, and St. Aidus, travelling, will come to thee, and thou wflt ask him, and he will raise up thy son for thee.\" The mother, therefore, came and did bo, and when Aidus came to her, she wept before him. Then Aidus, walking over the pool dry shod, went to the place where the boys had been drowned therein, and there praying, he raised"], [151, "11 the three boys to life. And King Cushait offered his son with all his family to St. Aidus for ever; and St. Aidus gave to St. Molassus the same son and all his family. And when St. Aidus would leave his nation and country, and go into banishment, the King of his nation, named Albus, would not let him go, to whom the holy man said, \" Let me go into ban ishment, and I will give thee the Kingdom of Heaven, and thou shalt receive the new tonsure* from my hand, and thou shalt be under that tonsure until old age and death. The King said, \" It pleases me that thou shouldest go, if thou wilt stay with me until the time of tonsure, that we may see if the hair will grow again.\" And St. Aidus remained with him until that time, and then he let him go on his journey, and tlie King remained until his old age under the new tonsure. St. Aidus came to the borders of the Laginensians, t and being desirous to read the Holy Scriptures, he sailed over the sea to the regions of the Britons, and there reading at the City of St. David, he remained a long time, and performed many miracles. And on a certain day, when St. Aidus was there reading, the steward came to him, saying, \" Arise, and take a cart, that thou mayest go with the brethren and carry loads of what is necessary.\" The obedient boy arose immediately, and through haste left his book open ; and though heavy rain fell, the book was not injured, until David himself came to it. And the steward said to the boy, that he should hold two wild and untamed oxen, and immediately those oxen became mild and tamed under the hand of the boy \u25a0 also the steward gave to the boy a yoke without straps, and the yoke adhered to the neck of the oxen, as if it had been safely fastened with straps. And the boy asked the steward for a wooden peg, that he might apply it to the cart, to whom the * The Welsh and Irish shaved the forepart of the head from ear to ear, letting the hair grow behind, pleading the custom of St. Paul, which was the practice for a long time in the Gallican Church. The Ultramontane party shaved only the crown of the head, pleading the custom of St. Peter. It is very probable that the \" new tonsure \" which St. Aidus is here speaking of was tbe latter, which about this time was beginning to be adopted, together with several other observances of the Roman Church. t From the Lagean, a sort of broad edged lance brought 'from Gaul, and introduced into Ireland by Labra Lonseach, about 250 years before Christ; hence the people of Leinstor were called Lagenians, and their country Coigea-Lagcan. Vide O'Flaherty's Ogygla Domest., p. 269. C 2"], [152, "12 steward said, \" For that peg put thy finger,\" and so the obedient boy did, yet his finger was not hurt. Therefore all the workmen went before him, and he remained, and a little boy with him ; and the boy said to him, \" It is right that we should proceed on our journey.\" And Aidus said to the little boy, \" Mark thy eyes and come after me,\" and they passed over very moist land, and kept the road which remains to the present time ; and Aidus pre ceded the workmen with their carts, and at that hour David went to the sea coast with his family, and there said to the holy boy, \" Why didst thou leave thy book open to the rain?\" The boy Aidus, hearing this, went on his knees and prostrated himself before David, and would not rise until his senior, David, should tell him ; and he did not say to him \" arise.\" And the brethren came to his house, and the boy remained prostrate on the shore ; afterwards David enquired, \"Where was the boy.\" and the brethren said, \" We have not seen him, but when we saw him prostrate on the shore.\" Then David sent his family to the shore, and found the sea full, and the boy lying on the sea, and the sea was raised in a circuit about him, and they with a rope drew him into the ship. Also, at another time, the steward being excited with envy, thought to kill the holy boy Aidus, and on a certain day he sent the boy with another layman, and a carriage, that they might bring sticks from the woods ; and the steward persuaded the lay man to kill the boy in the woods ; therefore having yoked the oxen, the layman and holy boy went together to the woods ; and when the boy there stooped that he might raise a stick, the lay man raised his axe thai he might strike it against his head, but his hands, when raised up, withered in the air. Then the layman confessed his crime, and by the prayer of the saint he was restored. And this circumstance was told to St. David, who arose quickly and ran. Then the brethren were disturbed on seeing their senior walking without a shoe, and his having a shoe only on one foot, and they followed him ; and the holy boy came with the carriage to the river which is called Cledde, and when St. David saw the boy coming, he there stopped, and said to the brethren, \". Do not follow me,\" for David saw innumerable troops of angels about the boy. And the boy seeing David afar off, waiting for him, came quickly through the river, and by near ways, on which no man"], [153, "13 ever walked before, in a straight road, to the place where he saw David standing, and where a cross was placed, which remains to this day. And when the brethren came home, David began to scold the steward, and the holy boy said, \"It is not necessary that thou shouldest scold him, for if thou so doest he will soon die, and no one will see his sepulchre.\" And so it happened. And on another day, the holy boy Aidus carried a tribute vessel fuU of ale to the city, and when he came to another difficult road near the valley, the cart with the vessel fell into the valley, with the oxen ; and the holy boy marked the vessel and the oxen, and not one drop was lost from the vessel, and it came safe in the cart to level ground. And on a certain day, the son of the King, who was blind, aud lame, and deaf, was brought to the holy boy Aidus, and by his praying he cured him of all his infirmities. Also, on a certain day, a man was brought who had a plain face, without eyes and nostrils, and Aidus blessed his face, and gave him eyes and nostrils. At another certain time, the Saxons came to war against the Britons ; aud then the holy boy, being re quested, went with the Britons to the war, and the Saxons when they saw him were immediately put to flight, and the Britons pursued them for seven days, and so, through means of the bless ing of the holy boy, not one man fell on that day. And as long as the boy Aidus dwelt in the country of the Britons with St. David, the Saxons did not dare to come there. Certain vagabonds of the Saxons came into those regions of the Britons, that they might injure someone if they could, which Aidus knowing, they immediately became blind through his imprecations, and neither injuring nor killing anyone, they returned back and were blind for a whole year. A certain king of the Saxons came to prove him, saying, \" I am blind and deaf ;\" to whom Aidus answered, \" On the contrary, thou art neither deaf nor blind ; but as thou hast lied in tempting me, from this day thou wilt not be a king, and thou wilt continue blind and deaf to the day of thy death.\" And so it was fulfilled. After this St. Aidus sailed with the blessing of St. David to the Island of Ireland, and came to the regions of Fothart Campi Itha, and when he approached the land he saw on the sea the murdering of some strangers, who came with their ships into that district, and by the king of that nation were slain. Then St."], [154, "14 Aidus said to his attendants, \" Let us go quickly and assist those wretched persons who are now murdered.\" And Aidus struck his bell on the sea, and the king hearing the sound of the beU, said, \" That sound is of a bell of a man with a favour ;\" and they left off killing the strangers. When, therefore, Aidus had come to the harbour, the king sent to him one of his attendants named Drinma, the son of Cainre, and he received Aidus on his shoulders from the ships, and the king offered him the district named Bentrocht, and also at the same time he gave up his dis trict with his son-in-law, and offered it to Aidus for ever. And when St. Aidus was in that district he considered in his heart' saying, \" I am sorry that I did not ask my instructor who in this island of Ireland should be the friend of my heart.\" Then he arose that he might go over the sea to St. David ; and when he had walked on the sea dry shod to the third part, lo ! an angel of the Lord met him, and said, \" There was great confidence in what thou hast done, in going on foot over the sea.\" To which Aidus answered, \" I have not done this through confidence, but through strength of faith.\" And the angel said to him, \"There is no need that thou shouldest have a friend of thy heart, and between thee and thy Lord there will not be a middle person ; but if thou wilt have a friend of thy heart, thou mayest have Molue, the mother of Choche.\" Then Aidus returned to Ireland. After these things Aidus came to the district which is caUed Ardladrand, and when there and he had returned from the place called Arcel, he recoUected that he had forgotten his bell in the country of the Britons, and when it was necessary for him that he should strike his bell at the legitimate hour, he immediately saw his beU coming from Britain over the sea, and placed by him ; and rejoicing at his coming he gave thanks to God. Also on another day St. Aidus went in his chariot over the sea from the place which is caUed Ardladland, as far as Fin Dubride Jerthnandesse, and the hoofs of his horses and the wheels of his chariot were not dipped in the sea, for it was as solid as the hardest earth. After these things Aidus came to a place called Dissert Nambri, and there dwelt with his brethren ; and he had two cows, with one calf ; and on a certain night, when St. Aidus heard the noise of the hungry wolves seeking food from their owner, he pitied them, and came and placed the calf of the two"], [155, "15 cows before the mouths of the wolves, and they devoured it. And when it was morning, the cook rising, enquired for the calf, to whom Aidus said, \" Do not enquire for it, for while thou wast sleeping I gave it to the hungry wolves.\" The cook replied, \"How can we appease the cows?\" To whom Aidus said, ' Give me thy head that I may bless it.\" And he blessed his head and said to him, \" Go and show thy head to the cows,\" and the cows on seeing the head of the clergyman came and licked it, and so were appeased until they again brought forth calves ; and this miracle Aidus performed more than once, for on the calves dying he blessed the clergyman's head, and the cows loved him as a calf. And on a certain day, when St. Aidus was in a mill grinding the flour of wheat, a certain man of the race of Assan came to Aidus and asked him for flour ; and again the same man, having changed his dress and blinded one of his eyes, came to the holy man of God, and in the name of the Lord asked for flour ; but St. Aidus knowing his coming, said to him, Why hast thou done this, that thou shouldest come again and ask . I will give thee flour through the name of the Lord, but thou wilt be blind until the day of thy death, and of thy kindred there will always be one blind for ever. Which was so fulfilled. And at another time, when St. Aidus was at the place which was called Vuainmar, the common people of that district came to St. Aidus, that they might commit their money to his keeping. And when the king of the descendants of Neill, Aidus, son of Ammereth, came with his army into that district, it was told him that much of the money of the common people was committed to the keeping of St. Aidus. The king therefore came with his guards, being de sirous to obtain the money. Then St. Aidus set the mark of his stick between the enemy and the place where the money was de posited. And a certain herald came beyond the mark of the stick and said, There is no clergyman who can forbid me to pass over. And when he had said thi3, he immediately died ; and others seeing this did not dare to come, but being struck with great fear, returned back, carrying with them the dead herald ; and they glorified St. Aidus. St. Aidus also came to the place which is called Senbothend ; and whilst he dwelt there, on a certain day, he saw a wolf going"], [156, "16 about and very hungry. Then he asked a boy who resided with him, Have you any food . The boy answered, I have one loaf and part of a fish . From whom Aidus tookioaf and gave it to the wolf; and the boy blushed, to whom Aidus said, \" Bring me a leaf,\" which when brought Aidus blessed, and thereof he made a loaf and gave it to the boy. After these things .Aidus came to the harbour of Ferns, and there sat under a certain tree, in which place there was no water. Then Aidus said to his attendants, \" Cut that tree,\" and immediately a fountain of water arose, which until this day is called Tipra Moedoc. Then a certain man named Bee, the son of Cogin, came to him and gave him the site for a residence, and there St. Aidus remained. And women and the daughter of Bee came that they might wash their clothes in the neighbouring river ; and to see the women did not please the holy man, who said to them, \" Go away,\" but they said, \" We will not go away.\" Then a woman, who was washing clothes, moving, her feet adhered to her shoes, and her shoes adhered to the earth, and the woman being altogether fastened wa3 nearly dead. Bee hearing this came to the man of God, requesting him to loosen his daughter, who, being liberated, Bee offered to St. Aidus his habitation and family for ever. And at another time, a certain herdsman lived near the place Ferns, whose mother was tormented with a grievous disease near to death ; and he, the said herdsman, came to St. Aidus, and re quested of him blessed water for his mother. Then St. Aidus arose and went with the herdsman to his mother ; but the herds man ran quickly homeward before the man of God, and found his mother dead; who returned to the holy man and said, \" Man of God, do not be troubled, for my mother is dead,\" to whom Aidus answered, \" Go and tell thy mother to come and greet me.\" And the herdsman went and spoke to his mother, saying, \" Arise, St. Aidus calleth thee,\" and she immediately arose in health from death as from sleep, and hastening ran to St. Aidus, and gave thanks to God and his saint. And on another day, St. Aidus came with his auditors to Holy Fintan, the son of Tulchan, and were received as guests with great joy and honour, and supper being finished Fintan said to his servant, \" Go and tell St. Aidus that on that night he should provide refreshment for them.\" And Aidus said to his servant, \" What Fintan has said we will do,"], [157, "17 and tell him that refreshment will be provided for all, in a similar manner, who reside at that place.\" Fintan replied to his servant, \" Tell Saint Aidus that we cannot all have refreshment, for many of us are afflicted with very grievous diseases, and having those diseases, we cannot be refreshed.\" And Saint Aidus said, \" God is able to give health to them all.\" And when he had said this, immediately in that hour all the sick were healed, nor was there any spot found on them. And on the third day, when Saint Aidus would go from that place, Mundu said to him, \" Thou shalt not go from this place until thou hast given^to every one the disease which he had before.\" To whom Aidus answered, \" The Lord gave me the healing of them.\" And Saint Mundu said, \" Although the Lord gave to thee the healing of them, thou shalt not go from this place until thou givest back to every one his own disorder.\" Then Saint Aidus gave his own disorder to every one, and he departed with a beuediction. And at another time King Brandub, the son of Cochae, came with a great herd of cattle by the shore of Echdrome, and lo ! a certain leprous man came and asked for something from him, to whom King Brandub gave a thin black handkerchief, and the King went with his herd to the river which is called Slane, and remain ing there that night, a grievous disease nigh unto death feU upon him, and in the depth of the disorder he saw a vision, for he was carried to hell ; and he saw all kinds of beasts entering the mouth of hell with open lips; and he saw another great beast with open mouth in the gate of hell, whose claw drew the king to him. When the beast had nearly devoured him, a certain clergyman placed the thin black handkerchief in the mouth of the beast, and as the beast devoured the handkerchief, the King in the meantime returned from his mouth. And again a claw of the beast going after the King drew him back, and he nearly devoured him. Then the same kind clergyman, with his stick, struck the head of the beast, and he shut his fiery mouth, and so King Brandub escaped the danger of hell ; and the King was carried in his disease to the place called Bercrimthan, and there he was in grest pain. Then his friends said to him, \"A certain man named Holy Aidus resides in this district. Send therefore that holy water may be brought from him to thee.\" To whom the King said, \" I will rather go myself to the man of God.\" And goiDg up he came D"], [158, "18 to the place of St. Aidus ; and when King Brandub saw at a dis tance St. Aidus coming to him, he said to his attendants, \" This j- the clergyman who delivered me from hell.\" Then the King prostrated himself at the feet of the Saint, and said, \" I repent of all the evil I have done ; aU things which thou hast told me in all my life I will fulfill, for thou hast delivered me from the pains of heU and its beasts.\" And in that hour the King was healed of every disease, the Saint at the same time uttering his blessing. And King Brandub gave much land to St. Aidus, and in their whole life they were mutual friends. And on a certain day when St. Aidus went from a place which is called Ardraland, he came to the rock of Driunne, and saw six ploughs going by mistake in the port of Ferns, and with elevated hand he blessed them from afar, and one of the ploughmen feU be tween the coulter and the ploughshare, and was not hurt, and amongst them nothing was injured except one smaU strap, which St. Aidus showed on the inquiry of his companions. And at another time St. Aidus went to holy virgins, daughters to Aidi, son of Cohirber, and took with him a plough and oxen that he might plough with them. And when they yoked the oxen for ploughing lo ! a certain leprous woman came and asked that Aidus should give her the ox, to whom Aidus gave that which was chosen from the others. Then the ploughmen said to him, \" What shaU we do, and how shah we be able to plough ?\" To whom Aidus said, \" Wait a little while for the ox which will quickly come to us.\" and suddenly they saw an ox coming to them from the neigh bouring sea, which raising its voice beUowed three times, and humbly placed his neck in the yoke of the other ox, and it ploughed with them in the three months of the spring, and in the beginning of each day came from the sea to plough, and raising its voice three times, returned at the end of the day to the sea. And at another time St. David sent to St. Aidus requesting that he should come and greet him, and immediately obedient Aidus went to the country of the Britons. And when the time came that he should again return, he said to St. David, \" How shall I go over the sea?\" to whom the blessed St. David said, \" Go to the sea, and whatever animal will come to thee go thereon and pass over the sea.\" Then Aidus went to the sea in the country of the Britons, and he saw a large animal in the likeness of a great"], [159, "19 horse, and sitting on his shoulders he came across the sea to Ireland to a place which is called Imber Cremthrain, and the animal returned to the sea. Also at another time Saint Aidus remained for fifty days and fifty nights in his city, eating and drinking nothing ; and his body rather enlarged and increased in his fasting, for he had an enlargement the whole length of his body, and another on his girdle. And having completed his fast, God gave four grants to his petitions. First, whoever of the Laginensians should sit in his seat would go with him to heaven, and that hell should not be closed on his family after the day of judgment. And on another day when St. Aidus went in his chariot to the ford Imgerit, the driver said to him, \"Tell me who will sit in thy seat after thee.\" To which Aidus answered. \" The man who will open to us the gate of that ford ; he will be the chief after me.\" Then they quickly saw a great many scholars with shields and spears in their hands ; and it was winter and frost, and when the scholars ran, they saw one of them leaping from his armour and opening the gate ; and the driver of the chariot, seeing the. young man open ing the gate without a key, was astonished, and considering within himself, said, \" Will not this person hold the government after St. Aidus ?\" The scholar said to the saint, \" 1 will go with thee.\" To whom Aidus said, \"Whence art thou, and by what name art thou called?\" The scholar said, \"I am of the family of the Mumunensians and of the inhabitants of Hirlcore, and Cronanus is with me.\" To whom Aidus said, \" It is suitable ; Mochoc Lochre follow me,\" and he immediately followed him. This Mochoc Lochre was a holy and religious man whom St. Aidus appointed to hold the government after him. And St. Aidus himself having performed good works desired in good old age to migrate to God with great joy and triumph, between choirs of angels singing sweet hymns, and to be with Christ after the example of blessed Paul, but the Lord would that, on account of many, he should remain longer in the flesh. And at another time St. Aidus went to the borders of the Mumunensians, in the regions of the descendants of Neil Cluanna Clabdig, wherein he loosed his neighbour from captivity, and came to the door of the King, with whom his son-in-law was a a prisoner. The holy man fasted for three days, and in the very d 2"], [160, "20 hour of fasting the daughter of the king died, whom St. Aidus had raised at the request of the queen ; but the king opposed the holy man with harsh words. And when St. Aidus began to curse the king, a boy stood near and said, \" Hail, senior, pour thy malediction upon this rock;\" and when St. Aidus began to curse the rock, it was immediately divided into two parts. And the king, seeing this, performed penance, and dismissed his son-in law, and gave him the farm of Guam Claidbich. Also on another day St. Aidus was in a cornfield with his brethren, in number fifty-three men, and King Brandub came to the harvest, and^adiniring the concord and humility of so many persons, he said, \" This is wonderful.\" To whom St. Aidus said. \" It is more wonderful that in the number there is not a child of death but one.\" To whom the king said, \" who is the child of death, that I might watch him?\" Blessed Aidus answered, \" Thou wilt know him in the hour of celebrating.\" And when they had celebrated the third hour, and had sung pater noster, all bowed themselves to the earth except the son of death. Then the king went out and asked, \" Why didst thou not bow with the others ?\" He answered, \" My mind was thinking of other things, because I expect my nation, that they may carry me to my province.\" And so coming, they carried him, and before the end of the week he was slain. At a certain time St. Aidus went to the country of the Mum unensians, to the citadel C'assil ; and the horses stood under the chariot immovable ; and an angel coming to him, said, \" God wills that thou shouldest go another way, and to the cell of the Sons of Duach, in the district of Connaught, because King Guare is there afflicted with most grievous disorders unto death, that thou mayest cure him.\" To whom Aidus answered, \" I will not go.\" The angel said, \" Although thou wilt not, yet go, because God wishes it.\" Then Aidus said to the driver of the chariot, \" Let the horses go wherever they will,\" and they turned north wards. And when they had come to a pool, they went with the chariot with dry feet over the pool, as if upon dry ground. After things they found in the road two men, to whom Aidus said, \" Show us our way.\" One said, \" If they are good clergy men, of rough places they may make a smooth road.\" Then St. Aidus blessed the road, and they went over rough mountains,"], [161, "21 and through woods and hillocks without impediment to the cell of the sons; and there he cured King Guare, and said to him, \" Thou wilt hold thy kingdom thirty years, and at the end of thy fife thou wilt be again in sickness, that thou mightest receive the Kingdom of Heaven;\" and so it happened. A certain holy man named Molona, who was the son of Dimme, being desirous to go abroad, came to St. Aidus, and said to him, \" I wish to go into exile.\" To whom St. Aidus answered, \" I am not willing that thou shouldest go abroad.\" And Molona said, \" If I shall not go to Rome and to foreign nations I shall die.\" Then Aidus took him with him in a fiery chariot, and they went together to Rome; and when they had remaiued there one night, they again returned to the city of Ferns, and Aidus said to him, \" Hast not thou a right to go to Rome ?\" Molona answered, \" I will not go there; I will go to my own countrymen, but I am ashamed to go by the way which I came.\" Then St. Aidus took him again with him in the fiery chariot, and went with him and left him at his residence in the midst of his coun trymen. And on another day St. Aidus was by the cross at the door of the house of tbe Abbot, writing psalms for a certain boy; and his father saw St. Aidus suddenly ascending by a golden ladder placed between heaven and earth, carrying with him the book or wraxen tablet of the boy. And again returning after a long time, the boy could not endure his hall and his countenance ; and Aidus said to the boy, \" See that thou tell this to no one whilst I live.\" Whom the boy answered, \" If thou wilt tell me where thou didst go, I will conceal what I saw.\" To whom Aidus said, \" I went to the mirth which the family of heaven made on the arrival of a dove that was my friend.\" And on a certain day the steward Mochoc Lochre came to St. Aidus to enquire what he should do with respect to a small quantity of ears of corn which remained in the barn \u2014 whether it was to be sowti in the earth or given to the family; whom Aidus answered, \"Sow it soon in the earth, and give daily abundantly to the brethren, and that small quantity will not fail until new bread come again.\" And so it took place, for at the end of Autumn the quantity of ears of corn was found entire. Also on another day the cook came to him and said, \" I have with me to-day in the kitchen only a moderate vessel of milk and a small quantity of"], [162, "22 butter; whether shall it be given to the guests or to the brethren?\" To whom Aidus said, \" Give it to all, and so largely distribute as as if thou didst draw from a mountain or river.\" Then the cook put aside his pot and distributed the food to all, as much as every one wished to take. Certain cunning and deceitful men hid their clothes in the woods, and asked him for clothing ; to whom Aidus said, \" Stay a little while until ye shall receive clothing.\" Then Aidus sent his servants privately to where their clothes had been hidden, and their clothes were brought to them, and they knowing their own clothes, returned confused and without getting anything. Also on another day a certain man named Saran killed Brandub, the King of the Langinenseans. Aidus, on hearing this, said, \" I wish that the hand which has killed Brandub might fall from the side of the man, but yet after repentance,\" which was done, for that Saran lay near the sepulchre of the king, with closed hands day and night, until the king said to him from the sepulchre, \" 0, Saran, thou brute, it is forgiven to thee what thou hast done.\" And with this the hand of Saran fell from his side. And St. Aidus went to the sepulchre of King Brandub and raised him therefrom. To whom the King said, \"If thou wilt give me the Kingdom of Heaven I request that I might now go there.\" Then having received sacrifice,4' he went to heaven, and was buried in the city of Ferns. A certain poor man from whom the King exacted much tribute, came to St. Aidus to ask assistance from him. Aidus was at that time sowing seed in the earth, and he put half a bushel of barley in the bosom of the petitioner, which was immediately turned into gold. And Aidus said to him, \" Give this to the King and thou shalt be free.\" And the King seeing the gold, said to his servant, \" Who gave thee so much gold?\" He answered, \" St. Aidus gave it to me.\" To whom the' King said, \"This gold I will not receive, but I will give it to God and St. Aidus, and render thee free for ever.\" Then the ser vant went to Aidus and he sowed the grain in the earth. And at another time, when St. Aidus would build an oratory, and not having a builder, he blessed the hands of a certain uninstructcd man named Gobban, and he immediately became a most skilful * Sacrament ?"], [163, "23 workman; and he built a most excellent oratory to the day of judgment; and St. Aidus said that it would not fail; which was done. And on a certain day St. Aidus went out to wash his hands at the fountain; and some persons of the brethren, looking on, said among themselves, \" No one can move St. Aidus to strife.\" Then a certain brutal man of them said, \" I can move him to strife;\" and Aidus was clothed with the skins of foxes, and the brutal man went out and threw him into the fountain; to whom Aidus said, \" Thou art a most brutal young man on account of that deed.\" And the young man seeing that the clothes of St. Aidus were dry, without one drop of water, said, \" I repent of what I have done.\" To whom the Saint answered, \"Thou hast done weU to declare thy repentance; for if thou hadst not repented the earth would have swallowed thee; now thou wilt obtain heaven, and on the fortieth day thou shalt die.\" And on another day a steward namely Mochoe Locram came to him and said, \" What shall we do, for we have already the materials of a church out of the woods, but we have not men enough to carry those numerous and heavy burdens.\" To whom Aidus said, \" Go ye home, and whatsoever ye shall see in the night, do not overlook.\" And in that night they heard a great noise in the city, and no one dared to look. Then a certain layman looked through a keyhole, and saw a multitude of weU formed youth with golden locks reaching to their shoulders, carrying timber, and those angels measured out the foundations of the church. Then St. Aidus said to the angels, \" Cease from this work,\" for unless a man had overlooked it the angels would have built the whole church; afterwards Gobban built it. And at a certain time, when St. Aidus walked in the borders of the Mumunensians, not far from the cell of St. Ita, he heard a long sound of a bell; and when Aidus asked \" What was that sound?\" it was told him, \" St. Ita, a pupil, is now dead, therefore come and raise her.\" Then St. Aidus sent one of his attendants with his staff, and when it was placed on the maiden she arose alive and weU. A certain thief stole the best of the cattle of St. Aidus and eat it; and when he wTould swear before St. Aidus that he had not eaten the animal, an ear of the cow was seen on his lips, and all of the bystanders derided him. And on another day certain men came there having a holy man bound,"], [164, "24 and when they went through the woods, a certain little thief, one of their enemies, met them. Then they flying in different direc- tions, left him who was bound, who returned to St. Aidus and was liberated. And on a certain day St. Aidus stood in a corner of his church for a long time; then St. Mundu, son of Tulchan, seeing him said to him, \" What is that which thou seest? tell me;\" then St. Aidus marked the eyes of St. Mundu, and he saw the whole world from the rising to the setting of the sun. And at another time, when St. Aidus walked in the way, Colman, grand- son of Faicrach,' met him; and in that hour the horse of Colman died. Then Aidus gave his horse to the chariot of Colman ; and when they parted from each other, another horse, Iacinctus, sent by God, immediately came under the chariot of St. Aidus. And when Colman returned, his horse alive and well arose to meet him. And on a certain day, when St. Aidus planted apple trees in the ground, the man who brought him the seeds of apples also brought unfruitful trees with the others, as plum trees, and St. Aidus planted them all in common, and of those unfruitful trees he made them fruitful with apples. Also, at another time, multi- tudes of the descendants of Neil, and of the Connaughtans, and Vlathanensians, and the Dalriati, and the Dail Araadii, and northern persons of the whole country, came that they might pillage their region in revenge of Cummascaig, the son of Aido, son of Ameredius. Then King Brandub went out to greet Aidus, who said to him, \" Go to the contest, and we shall all be therein.\" And in that night Aidus passed the time in delay, but King Brandub engaged in the battle, and the northern men fled, and after twenty-four contests in one night, gave themselves to flight. A certain paralytic man came from Rome, who sought a cure throughout the world for his complaint, and could not find it. When all said, \"No one can cure thee unless St. Aidus, who is in Ireland.\" And when he went over the sea he found St. Aidus dead ; but the spittle which he found in his mouth cured him of all his complaints. There was a certain man in the borders of the Lagenians* named Finan, who had been diseased thirty years. He, on the day of the Festival of St. Aidus, which is the eleventh of the * The people of Leinster."], [165, "25 calends of March, saw a wonderful chariot descending from heaven to the city of Ferns, in which was a delightful clergyman and a cloaked woman. And he asked them who they were, and the clergyman answered, \"We are St. Bridget and Aidus ; and we come that we may bless our places and them who honoured us on the day of our departure with gifts and oblations ; and be thou glad, for on the third day thou shalt go to heaven.\" After these things the chariot went to Kildare. And at another time, St. Moiling in Lochar held the government of Ferns, and went up to the bed of Aidus. To whom a certain clergyman said, \" Do not go up to the bed of the holy man;\" and Moiling said, \"I will sleep therein.\" And when he had gone up to the bed, imme diately severe illness attacked him. Then Moiling said, \" A issu oro fetor ar saethu galar fil form inniain de cenom bebad a Issu.\"* But pain did not cea.e to torment him. And again Moiling said, \" A issu oro fetor ar lussu nom nice nadab iarussu ni erthag liag act tusu.\"| But yet the pain did not cease greatly to torture him. And again MoUing said, \" A issu dom comarce a meic de bi ar \u0153c galar madam hi miner ica mi fil arthe nod ica so nim.\"| Then MoUing arose from the bed and promised that he would not sleep in it again. And Moiling said, \" Not every one is worthy to sleep in the bed of St. Aidus. I will not sleep therein.\" In this ap peared how much glory St. Aidus had in heaven, in whose bed no one could sleep on earth. For St. Aidus feasts in heaven amidst choirs of angels and apostles and all the saints, in joy without sorrow, in a kingdom without end, in life without death, and in the sight of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is honour and glory throughout all ages. Amen. ST. MADOC'S WELSH CHURCHES. The Churches of Llanwhaden, Nolton, and Westharoldston, in Pembrokeshire, are ascribed to him.

LIST OF INCUMBENTS. Compiled from various sources. John David, Rector, A.D. 1536, temp. Henry VIII; vid. ex. tract from the \" Valor Ecclesiasticus,\" relating to Llanmadoc Church. For the next hundred years the list of incumbents names is a blank, and up to the present time I have met with no records from which the missing information could be supplied. The name of the Rev. George Parry, A.M., appears tis Rector, circa 1619. He was also Rector of the adjoining parish of Cheriton, and one of the ejected clergy during the Commonwealth, but was re instated a.i the Restoration. In the pedigree of Long, of Llanmadoc. the name of f SIR NICHOLAS BatC'OCK appears as \" Parson of Llanmadock.\" From this pedigree it would seem as if he had been incumbent towards the latter end of the 17th century, and probably succeeded George Parry. * Pub. by the Spalling Club vid plates 55 and 56. t The title Sir was often given to the clergy jibout this time."], [167, "27 From a note made in one of the old Register books we learn that the Rev George Harris was presented to the living in 1722. He was buried Jan. 21st, 1753. From this date to 1773 there is a blank, which I have not been able to fill in. In 1773 the Rey. Watkin Knight was presented ; the inscription on his tomb in the Chancel of the Church states that he died January 2nd, 1795, having been 22 years Rector of the parish. He was succeeded by the Rev. SAMUEL Davies. A. memorandum in the Register books states that he was \" inducted into the living of Llanmadock by the Rev. James Edwards, Curate of Cheiiton, on Saturday, the 25th of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety five.\" He appears to have been succeeded by the Rev. Hector Bowen ; the names of the Rev. Hector Bowen, Rector, and James Edwards, Curate, with the date 1813, are cast on the lid of the iron chest in which the parish Registers are kept. He was succeeded by the Rev. James Edwards, tlie first appearance of whose name as Rector is in 1822. He died in 1833, and was succeeded in the year 1834 by the Rev. Prosser Pearce, B.A. He died in 1860, and the author succeeded him in tliat year. ANCIENT CUSTOM Of keeping the Churchyard WaU of the Parish of Llanmadoc in repair. It was formerly the custom in Gower, and probably elsewhere, for all tenants and freeliolders to keep in repair the walls of their respective churchyards, a certain definite portion of which was assigned to each occupier, as the following survey, copied from an old MS. in my possession, dated 1757, will show : \u2014 \" The churchyard wall in the Parish of Llanmadoc is to be kept in repair by the owners or occupiers of the several lands and tenements in the parish hereafter named.\" Anno Domini 1757. The first nine yards, beginning at the north-east corner, by Samuel Rees formerly, but now by Elizabeth Holland, widow. e 2"], [168, "28 The next nine yards, southwards, by Henry Griffiths formerly, and now by Henry Griffiths, his son. The next four yards by Daniel Bydder, for tilpin land. The next five yards by Daniel Bydder, junior, for lease land under Mr. Aubrey. The next six yards by Thomas Price, for sea coombs, and now occupied by William Prichard. The next six yards by Walter Harris formerly, but now by Mr. John William, Rector of Cheriton, and now occupied by David Water. The next six yards by John Griffiths formerly, but now by David Water, for his lease land. The next three yards by Jane Lucas formerly, now by John Lucas, her son. The next three yards by ye sd. Jane Lucas formerly, but now by John Button. The next six yards by William Benet formerly, but now by Joseph Edwards. The next six yards by John Jone, now occupied by William Eynon. The next three yards by Robert Austin formerly, but now by John Holland. The next three yards by Edward William, and now occupied by Christopher Lewis. The next two yards and a half by the Widow Long formerly, but now by Robert Bydder. The next five yards by Edward Clement, and now occupied by Henry Lewis. The next six yards by Richard Bydder formerly, but now by David Evans, for Hills. The next six yards by Evan Jenkin formerly, but now by his wife, Mary Jenkins. The next and last five yards, ending at the north-west corner, by Nicolas Claypit formerly, and now by Henry Griffiths. In all 95 yards. PAINTINGS ON THE WALLS OF LLANMADOC CHURCH. During the restoration of the Church several ornamental bor ders were discovered beneath the whitewash, and chiefly on the"], [169, ""], [170, "PORTIOjN\" OF PAINTED BORDER FROM THE NAVE OE LLANMADOC CHURCH FONT OF LLANMADOC CHURCH."], [171, "29 north and south sides of the nave. The woodcut gives the design of one of them, which very much resembles the Chinese characters generally displayed on the outsides of tea chests. In this only one colour, black, was used. Some were painted in three colours \u2014 yellow, red, and black. These, however, were not the original stencillings, but overlaid others of quite a different style, the pattern of which I failed to ascertain, although I took considerable pains to do so. Within these borders I made out some fragments of words in the old black letter character, which seemed to be passages of Scripture. The east side of the wall, dividing the nave from the chancel, was profusely painted, the prevailing colours being light blue and vermillion ; but I was unable to make out the design. THE FONT The square-shaped form of the Font shows that it belongs to the type which is called Norman. It is very similar to the one in Llangennith Church. The base is quite modern.

Thus, with"], [172, "30 the exception of a very few, the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, otherwise called the Knights Hospitallers, possess 3d at one time nearly all the churches in Gower. In the following grant, the religious house at Dynmore is called (but incorrectly) a Preceptory ; strictly speaking the houses of the Templars were styled Preceptories, and those of the Hos pitallers Commanderies ; the terms, however, were often used loosely and without regard to accuracy. But as many of the Com manderies had once been Prece}-tories, this would probably cause some little confusion in describing them under their proper titles. \" PATENT ROLL, 4 & 5 PH. & MARY.

Llanmadock. Tbe Manor of Llanmadock in like manner was held of the aforesaid Lord by the service of one Knight's fee, and now in the tenure of Anthony Mansell, Esq., by grant of the Prince into whose hands it came by surrender. The occurrence of the word Principis in the notice of this Manor perplexed me for some time ; on shewing the passage to my friend, Mr. J. M. Lloyd, of Lincoln's Inn, he gave me the foUowing explanation : \u2014 \" Manors wrere of two kinds ; the one held directly of the King, and persons enjoying those were called tenants ' In Capite :' the other mediately through a mesne Lord, generally some great Baron, called the ' Lord Paramount,' or ' Seigneur,' \u2014 tenant in capite to the King of several Manors. The persons so holding of a mesne Lord were called tenants in paravail. The practice of subinfeudation, however, was put an end to by the statute of Quia Emptores (18 Ed. I. C. 1.) so that all present Manors were created before this date ; for under any enfeoffment made subse quently to the Act, the feoffee instead of holding of the feoffor, held of the same Lord Paramount as the feoffor had held. The Lord Paramount might be the King himself. Principis (therefore) will refer to the Lord Paramount, and who he is depends on the context.\" The Lord Paramount in this case was the Earl of Worcester, ancestor of the present Duke of Beaufort, who now enjoys this right and title as Lord Herbert of Gower. In the yearc,1559, as will be seen by the Patent EoU of 2nd Queen Ehzabeth, already quoted, that Anthony Mansell,* Esq., purchased of the Queen certain lands, messuages, and tenements, in the parish of Llanmadoc, amounting to the yearly value of seven pounds, eight shiUings, and eightpence halfpenny, together * Spelled Manxell in that document."], [182, "40 with an annual Boyal pension from the Rectorial tithes, of ten shillings, one penny halfpenny, all of which formerly belonged to. and were parcel of, the possessions of a Commandery of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, at Dynmore, in the county of Hereford. In the year 1650, Sir John Aubrey is mentioned as Lord of this Manor, for in a survey of the Seigniory of Gower taken by order of Oliver Cromwell in that year, the Manor of Llanmadoc is returned as held by Sir John- Aubrey, by the service of one Knight's fee. This Sir John lived at Llantrithed in Glamorgan shire, where there is a village called \" Tre Aubrey\" (Aubrey's town). In what way the Manor passed from the ManseUs to the Aubreys I have no means of knowing, in all probability it was by marriage ; it has remained in the latter family ever since. In 182G, Sir John Aubrey, the 6th Baronet, gave his Llan madoc estate for three \"lives, to Charlotte, daughter of Sir Samuel Whitconibe (private secretary to George the Fourth), and Mary Aubrey his wife. Charlotte Whitcombe married Henry J. Hyde Seymour, Esq., R.N., son of Colonel Francis Compton Seymour, and grandson of Lord Francis Seymour, dean of Wells, fourth son of the eighth Duke of Somerset. Thomas Digby Aubrey, Esq., succeeded to the Baronetcy at the death of his uncle, the before mentioned Sir John, and dying without male issue in 1856, the title became extinct. According to an old indenture found among the papers of the late Mr. George Holland, of Cwm Ivy, in this Parish, dated 1661 temp. Charles II. , Sir John's tenants at Llanmadoc had to plant sedge on the burrows, and to keep the sea waU in repair, and to deliver at his house at Llantrithed on a certain day every year a horse-load of fish. The heirs of Sir John have always retained the manorial rights, and the present Lord of the Manor is Charles Aubrey Aubrey, Esq., of Dorton House, and Boarstall Buckinghamshire. An excellent wood cut and a most interesting history of this ancient place, (Boarstall), are given in the \" Graphic and Historical Illustrator,\" edited by W. Brayley, F.S.A., 1834. The arms of Aubrey are Vert,* a chevron between 3 eagles, heads errased or. # According to _oiue, Azure."], [183, "41 The Sir John Aubrey mentioned above as living at Llantrithed in 1661, was one of the Royalist sufferers in the time of the and had to compound for his estate at a tenth, paying a fine of \u00a3660 13s. 8d. ; as will be seen in the foUowing particulars obtained from the original papers preserved in the Record Office in London.

The business transacted at these Courts was the presenting the death of tenants within the Manor, the right of ways, repairing of roads, wreck of sea, constables, strayer sheep, fence3 and gates, land share marks, and the judging of heriots on the decease of of tenants. On the death of the incumbent of this Parish a Heriot of ten shillings is claimed by the Lord of the Manor, whose residence in ancient times was probably the house which now goes by the name of the Mansion House. It is a very old building and not at all unlikely to have been in former times the Lord of the Manor's chief dwelling within his fee. All the timber in this old edifice is of oak which according to a tradition preserved in the parish is said to have been cut on Whitford Sker. It is now in a somewhat decayed state, and much of the original building gone, which in its day was doubtless on a par with other dwellings, of the then resident gentry, and would have been considered a fine place. As in the course of this work I shall have frequent occasion G 2"], [186, "44 to speak of Manors, tenements, dominicales, messuages and Court Baron ; it will perhaps be satisfactory to many to know the precise meaning of these terms. Manor (manerium) seems to be derived from the French Manoir, habitatio, or rather from the Latin manendo, of abiding there, because the Lord did usually reside there. It is called Manerium, quasi manurium, as if laboured by hand work ; it is a noble sort of Fee, granted to tenants for certain services to be performed, and partly reserved to the use of the Lord's family, with jurisdiction over his tenants for their farms. That which was granted.to tenants we call tenementales, those reserved to the Lord s * dominicales ; the whole fee was called a Lordship ; of old, a Barony, from whence the Court that is always appended to the Manor, is called a Court Baron. A messuage (messuagium) properly signifies a dwelling house with some adjacent land assigned to the use thereof, f This old house with its garden, orchard, and an adjoining field are at present the freehold property of Mr. John Gordon, of Llandimor.

Wilkins. The two foregoing agreements relating to the purchase of cer tain tenements in Llanmadoc, though perhaps of no very special value, I have thought them worth printing, as they may interest some of my parishioners, and are useful in tracing back the former owners of land, The figures at the top refer to the numbers on the court file. WHITFORD SKER. There is a tradition current among the people of Llanmadoc parish, that many years ago persons used to cross the river here from Penbrey on stepping stones. I was informed by an old man who was very familiar with the story, that one of the stepping stones \" was the head bones of a horse.\" The same tradition also states, that the inhabitants of Penbrey were obliged by an old custom, called \" Suit of Mill,\" to bring all their corn to grind at water grist mill at Llangennith, crossing the river at Whitford. Whitford is the Danish Hvit-fjord (Whiteford). * The Rev- Isaac Taylor says, \" Whitford sands, show that the Estuary of the Bttrry must have received from J^orseman the appropriate name of \" Hvit-fjord.\" When we consider the great encroachments of the sea on the Gower coast, evidenced by the numerous stumps of oak trees dotted here and there on the sands from high to low water mark, we at once perceive a condition of things in former times very different to the present, and we can the better understand, how Vid. Words and_Places, by the Rev. Isaac Taylor, 1th Ed. p. 117."], [189, "47 previous to the overflow of these low lying lands, persons could easily have crossed from Penbrey to Whitford, when the only water was the shallow bed of the Loughor river, which here takes the name of the Burry ; even now at a very high Spring, I should imagine it would not be by any means an impossible performance when the tide was out. There is a very old building in Llanmadoc village, called the \" Mansion house,\" the beams of which are said to have been cut on Whitford Sker. There is no reason whatever to doubt it. Henry Thomas, a labourer in my employ, since deceased, informed me that when a boy, he remembered seeing trunks of trees 40 feet long, in Broughton bay, in places where the force of the sea had exposed the native soil, which underlies the sand at no great depth in this bay. Mr. John Jenkins, farmer, of Lagadranta, whose family has occupied the farm there for several generations, has in his possession, a bullock's horn, with the letters D.I., and the date 1743, cut upon it. The Christian name of his father and grand father, was George, and he supposes that these letters were the initials of his great grandfather, David Jenkins, who, according to a tradition preserved in this family, had seen trees growing in Broughton Bay. By comparing this account with others com municated by aged persons, now living in the Parish, I should say, that it was quite possible that some few trees might have been in situ, and flourishing within the area of Broughton bay two hundred years ago, as David Lewis of Froglane, now in his 81st year, told me, thathe had heard his grandmother \u2014 who was over one hundred years old when she died \u2014 say, that she had milked cows in a green meadow at the foot of Spritsail Tor. The old* people also say, that their fathers told them, that a lime kiln stood several hundred yards lower down than the present high water mark, and that lime from this Tor was regularly burned there > that when the sea came in, and washed the kiln away, they built another closer to the cliff, and when this had to be abandoned *\u00a3That is the old people born> few years before the close of the last century, a few of whom are still alive."], [190, "48 <*\u25a0 etla^trx from the same cause, the people moved their kilns further inland, to the places where they are found at present. From these statements which are certainly circumstantial enough, it would appear that the formation of the burrows, and the destruction of the shore land in the immediate neighbourhood of Broughton Bay and Spritsail Tor, were comparatively recent events, while the formation of Whitford Burrows took place much earlier, as 1 shall presently show ; yet looking at the line of coast, it seems difficult to separate them in point of time. But be this as it may, it is quite certain that in 1661, the latter Burrows (Whitford) were in existence, for in an old Indenture Deed of the nature of a lease executed by Sir John Aubrey of Llantrithed, which I found among the papers of the late Mr. George Holland of Cwm Ivy, in this parish, it was there stated, among the condi tions of the lease, that Sir John's tenants at Llanmadoc were required to give one day every year, to plant sedge on the burrows ; it was rather an important day in this parish, and from the number of people who went to lend a hand, it was called the \" Burrow's fair.\" The object of sedge planting, \u2014 which has almost been given up, since the old leases feU in, \u2014 was to prevent the sand drifting, which it certainly did most effectuaUy. This extensive tract of sand hills, known as Whitford burrows, is divided into two parts, caUed the \" Old and New Burrows,\" the latter is dis tinguished from the former by a long level piece of ground, about ,^00 yards wide, more or less, called the \" Gpeat-Pkia.\" The New Burrows has been formed, and blown up from the shore within the last 50 years ; in the tithe map, the high water mark is shown as coming right up under Cwm Ivy Tor, along the edge of the \" Cunniger,\" and on to \" Hillsis Tor ;\" at the present day the sea is kept back by the formation of this \" New Burrows,\" and does not come within 500 yards of its old bouadary ; and there is every probability that it will recede stiU further, as the channel of the river is graduaUy tending to the north, while the old channel to the south is filling up with the sand which is continually moving inward. A few years ago there were three or four fathoms of water at low tide, in Broughton bay, and vessels of six and seven hundred tons could safely anchor there when the tide was out ; this pool is now quite filled up with the moving in of the tail of"], [191, "49 the Hooper sand bank, and is all but dry at low water. In the year 1878 Mr. John Jenkins of Llagadranta told me, that on one occasion he walked dry footed from the shore by Spritsail Tor, to the Hooper ; this shows what a very great change has taken place here within the last few years. With regard to the truth of the tradition of persons cross ing the river at Whitford, if it be not absolutely impossible at the present day, there could have been little difficulty in doing so some 300 years ago, when in all probability those oak trees, whose stumps we still find in the sand, flourished along the coast, and under whose shade the inhabitants of Penbrey drove their horses with corn to be ground at Llangennith mill. But further than this, there is good reason for believing, that the whole delta of the Burry river and Caermarthen bay was tonce a verdant plain. And however startling it may appear to some, there is now not the least doubt, that at a period still more remote, when the Rhinoceros and primitive elephant were to be found in Britain, the whole of the Bristol channel was a deep and fertile valley, where food in sufficient quantities could be found to support these huge creatures. A great variety of sea birds frequent Whitford Sker, especially the sea pie, or red-legged oyster catcher (Hematopus astralegus), thousands of which congregate here in the winter months, to feed upon the mussels and small Crustacea, with which the place abounds. Immense flocks of the * stone plover may be seen at the same time, but these all disappear in the Spring. Other birds, such as the Curlew, Comorant, Ash-coloured sand piper, Ringed plover, Large black-backed guU, and several kinds of divers may be seen here. Large quantities of Laver (Ulva latissima), are gathered on this Sker by some of the inhabitants, and carried to Swansea market. This wholesome and nutritious sea-weed is best in winter, when it is quite black, and sells during that season at the rate of tenpence, and occasionaUy one shilling a pound. In summer it it not so good, being of a light yeUow colour. The preparation ol * I am not quite sure as to the identity of this bird ; It may be that called the grey plover. H"], [192, "50 this vegetable is a long and tedious process. Aster gathering, it has to be washed in fresh water, and picked clean from all the ___ smaU mussels, which adhere to it. It is then put into large iron crock, and stewed over a slow fire for six* hours. After this, it is taken out and spread upon a deal table, and chopped very fine with a long knife, made out of a piece of an old scythe blade ; it is then made up into pounds and is ready for the market. It was on Whitford Point that the last smuggling transaction in Gower took place. The affair, however, was discovered, and the cargo which was composed of brandy, was seized by the custom house officers, but not without considerable difficulty and some opposition on the r_art of the inhabitants. Some little time before this unsuccessful run was made, two strangers came into the neighbourhood, giving out that they were miners in search of lead ore ; the truth being, that they were looking out beforehand for some convenient place to stow away the expected cargo. The more knowing ones, however, suspected what they were after, and the discovery of a dark lantern and a ball of spun yarn in a carpet bag, accidentally left open, removed all doubts as to the real nature of their business. The place they selected was a cave near the \"Three Chimnies.\" Few people know ofthe existence of this cavern. The entrance is by a narrow aperture \u2014 a kind of slit in the rock, just above high water-mark, and barely wide enough to admit the body of a stout man. Looking up from below no one would suppose that a cave existed here, there is, however, a very extensive one, but, as it is perfectly dark inside, it is necessary to use candle-light in exploring it. The first time I entered it I found part of a human jaw. There was some clayey soil here and there, with drift sand, and several large boulders or irregular blocks of limestone, which had doubtless been detached from the sides or roof of the cave. In the clay about Whitford Sker, fine specimens of the Pholas dactylus may be found. Great quantities of Cuttle bone, caUed by the people \" Mew shell,\" are sometimes washed on shore by the sea. It is very useful in removing the greasy surface of parchment * In the summer time, but in the winter season less thaD an hour's stewing will suffice"], [193, "51 before writing on, and is largely used by druggists in the prepara tion of tooth powder. If its value was better known it might be gathered by the poor people, without any trouble, and disposed of at a considerable profit. It is exceedingly light, and floats on the surface of the water. With a small hoop net fixed in a short handle, numbers of fine prawn may be caught under the hollow stones and and in the shallow pools on the Sker : at times the fishmongers give as much as three shillings and sixpence a hundred for them. On the marshy piece of ground near Whitford Point, over flowed by the sea at high springtides, there is to be seen a great quantity of an edible plant, which Mr. S. Benson, F.G.S., of Fairy Hill, informs me is the glass wort (Salicornia herbacea) ; a succulent sea green plant, of the salt m.arshes, often sold under the name of Samphiie, and made into a pickle ; but far inferior to the the genuine samphire which is never found except on the rocks. The glass wort, commonly called the Marsh Samphire by the country people, has a leafless and jointed stem, with small green flowers. A variety of other plants, some of which I have not observed elsewhere, are to be found growing on the adjoining burrows. Not far from what is called the Point of the Burrows, there are to be seen very large heaps of cockle shells. About 15 years ago I coUected a great many pieces of pottery irregularly dispersed among the shells ; some of them were ornamented with neat cir cular mouldings, and had evidently been made on a wheel. On putting several of these broken fragments together, a large open mouthed vessel was formed, very suitable as a cooking utensil, and was doubtless used for this purpose by the persons who fre quented these places. Here and there throughout the heap, I found several rude fire places, built up with a few flat stones. There are other similar heaps in these burrows, and in some of them I met with- a few oyster and mussel shells. It is supposed by some, that these heaps of cockle shells, technicaUy called \"Kjoken \u2014 modding,\" (kitchen middens) were formed by a race of fish eating people (the Icthyopophagi), who inhabited the shores of Europe at a remote period. The tradition of the country, however, points to a famine as the cause of these accumulations. They are to be found in Weobley Wood, high up li 2"], [194, "52 in the sides of Llandimor Cliffs, and strange to say, they have been met with in some of the church yards in Gower, especiaUy at Llangennith and Cheriton ; and what is still more extraordinary, on excavating some earth from the interior of the Nave of the latter church, I found in one particular spot a considerable quantity of calcined mussel and cockle shells, and fragments of wood ashes ; a tolerably plain proof that these shellfish had been cooked and eaten there. This seems a very surprising circumstance to us now-a-days ; but we have to remember that times were not always so peaceful as they are now. From the 9th to the 12th centuries, and even later, the parishoners had often to run to the church for shelter from tbeir enemies, and to stand a siege there, remaining in them several days ; and as they could not live without food, we can easily account for such anomalous appearances in the sacred buildings, as burnt ashes, stones blackened with smoke, and shells, such as cockles, perriwinkles, limpets, and mussels, &c. After writing the above, it occurred to me, that it might prove a rather interesting inquiry, and perhaps not an impossible one to ascertain the probable time when the catastrophe took place that destroyed the trees on Whitford Sker and its vicinity, and covered the once fertile land with barren sand. It was certainly a very notable occurence, and was doubtless duly chronicled by those curions in such matters ; but alas for us who live in these days, most of those old MS. records, which could supply us with so much information about the events of former times, were scat tered and lost before the art of printing, in the 15th century, lent us its valuable aid in multiplying and preserving copies of such old MSS. as still survived ; but books were rare and costly in the 16 th century, when, I think, it is very likely the destruction of the shore land hereabouts took place ; I do not, however, think it at all improbable that it might have occurred a century earlier ; but with the few historical notes I have been able to get, together with the help of the traditions of the place, and the natural inferences to be drawn from the present conditions of the sea and land, it seems to me that one can trace this last great inroad of the sea with tolerable certainty to the early part of the 16th century. From the old lease of Sir John Aubrey, already alluded to, we know for a fact that Whitford Burrows existed in 1661, and"], [195, "that Sir John's tenants at Llanmadoc planted sedge there as a customary thing at that time ; we learn also from the same document that there was a certain sea wall in existence, which by the terms of the lease these same tenants were to keep in repair ; but whether this was the present sea wall or not I am unable to say. Now I think no rational person can suppose that so large an extent of burrows as that of Whitford could have been blown to gether in one night, or, \u2014 judging from the way in which such formations are now going on, \u2014 even in 100 years : indeed the formation of what is called the \" New Burrows\" (to the West of the old burrows), which began about 50 years ago, is a proof of this ; and this new line of sand hills is a very insignificant formation compared to that -which is along side of it, and we may safely venture to say, will not equal it under another 50 or 100 years. Old Whitford Burrows then existed, as a fact, in 1661 ; giving it a period of at least 50 years to form, will bring us to the year 1511, and consequently about 20 years before the time when an Act of Parliament was passed in the 23rd year of Henry VIII. bearing upon certain injuries done by the \" outragious course and rage of the sea in and upon marshes and other low places.\" This act of Henry is alluded to in another act of the same purport, passed in the First year of Queen Mary, 1553, entitled \u2014 \"An Acte touchynge the Sea \u00a3andes in Glainorganshyere.* \" Anno Marie Primo.

There was no line of cliffs with steep precipitous sides to do so, and the only bulwark in this case must have been a barrier of sand hills ; and I take it that we behold the ruins of this ancient barrier in the long and dangerous shoal called the Hooper, which stretches from nearly the point of the Burry Holms to Whitford Sker. It would be a very curious and interesting thing for us to know (if we could see into the future), whether the sea which began 400 years ago to force itself onward in these parts, will be forced backward to its former limits, and the land lost for so many ages, be once again recovered from the sea, and be \" a pasture for flocks and herds to lie down in.\" If the present state of things con tinues, and the channel of the Llwchyr river keeps to the north it is by no means an unlikely occurrence. With regard to the comparatively recent overflow of the land at the foot of the Spritsail Tor, which seems difficult to separate in point of time from the parts adjacent to it, it can only be accounted for by supposing the continued existence of some portion of those sand hills, the ancient barrier, now destroyed by the sea ; and on making some further inquiries of the old man, David Lewis, my supposition was confirmed, as he informed me that there was a warren outside the green meadow where his grandmother had milked the cows, and that there used to be a good well of fresh water in this place. BONE CAVES IN LLANMADOC PARISH. There are several caves in this Parish ; some of them facing the sea, others a little inland. The most interesting is that called * Spritsail Tor Cave. This was thoroughly examined by Col. Wood, of Stouthall, in the year 1849. The stalagmitic floor having been broken up, an * The inhabitants invariably call it \" Sprisins Tor.\" It has been thought that Sprisin may be a corruption of Spritsail ; but it by no means follows that the modern orthography is correct.

Priscus, Felis spel\u0153us, Canis lupus, C. Vulpes, Meles Taxus and Mustela. All the most perfect and interesting of these remains were deposited by him in the Museum of the Royal Institution, at Swansea, Previous to the examination by Col. Wood, Sir Henry de la Beche, accompanied by Mr. Logan, Mr. S. Benson, Mr. Mat. Moggridge, Mr. Gutch, and Mr. G. G. Francis, explored this cave in 1839, and found the bones of Hyenas, and some teeth of the Rhinoceros. The fossil remains in tbis cave were similar to those met with in Paviland cave. A human lower jaw was found, with the teeth quite worn down, as if they had been employed in masticating some very hard substances, such as peas or beans. There is a notice of this visit in one of the reports of the Royal Institution, with an early photograph by Mr. Gutch. I should mention that this cave has two chambers, connected internally by a narrow low passage. It now presents two external openings in the frontage of the cliff, and about 13 feet apart. Originally there was but one entrance, \u2014 that to the eastward ; this had long been concealed by drift sand, overgrown with sedge, and the existence of the cave was unknown until the year 1839, when a quarryman, William HttUin, (since deceased,), prized off a large drift of lime stone, and thus by the accident as it were, the cave was broken into, and the western opening formed. \u00a7 Upon making this unexpected discovery, he called to another (George Evans), who was working close by to come and explore the place. The latter informed me, that upon entering the cave, they observed the remains! of a fire and several fragments of what * Vide \" Dr. H. Falconer's Pal\u00e6ontological Memoirs,\" vol. ii., p. 623. t The discovery of these relics is not mentioned by Dr. Falconer in his admirable description of this cave and its contents, given in the \" Pal\u00e6ontological Memoirs,\" vol. ii., p. 523.

Hullin to the Museum at Swansea."], [199, "TOOTH OF RHINOCEROS AND PAET OF A HYENA'S JAW FROM SPIUT SAIL TOR CAVE."], [200, ""], [201, "57 he took to be an old leathern hat, and that the shape was something like that ofthe \"wide awake\" ofthe present day ; lying near the fire they found what he thought to be, an arrow head, made of some \" Poisoned metal,\" and shaped something like a sailor's needle, and about six or seven inches long. On seeing these unmistake able signs of human occupation, he said, that they wondered very much how the people could have got into the cave. In the course of two or three days this mystery was explained, for continuing to prize off the drift, a large flat piece, which overhung the old mouth of the cave slipped down, and on clearing this away together with a quantity of sand, the real entrauce was discovered. I had heard it stated, that there was a communication between this cave (which is high up in the cliff), and the shore below. In the year 1875, owing to the sand at the base of the rocks having been undermined by the action of the waves, a great fall of earth and stones took place from above : this again having been washed away by the sea, the face of the rock was exposed to an unusual extent, and disclosed amongst other things, a large opening pene- trating the cliff and taking an upward direction, it was much choked with loose stones and earth, and looked so exceedingly dangerous that I was afraid to explore it. This was no doubt the communication spoken off by the old people, and there is no improbability in the supposition that such a connection exists. About 50 yards to the North East of the cave, a heap of cockle shells, (similar to those at Llanmadoc Burrows), was exposed at the same time. This had also been covered by blown sand, and had never been observed before. It is being rapidly (1878) covered over again with the sand with is constantly blowing in. Its situation is rather below the level of the'niouth of the cave, and is so placed on the steep side of the burrows that it cannot be approached without very great danger, and any attempt rashly to meddle with it might bring down an avalanche of sand on the adventurer's head, so that whatever treasures it may contain in way of pottery, &<_., are likely to remain intact for sometime to come ; there is, however, no doubt that it is one of the old ' kitchen middens,\" as numbers of the sheUs which had fallen down below, bore a burnt and scorched appearance, and several were filled and encrusted with wood ashes. I"], [202, "58 Cwm Ivy Tor Cave. This cave is not so well known, and has never been explored. It is situated in the North Side of the Tor, and is at present quite filled up with rubbish. The height of this tor above the level of the sea is 200 feet. Cave by Cheriton Pill. In the ivy covered rock a httle to the North of the Free Cliffs, and not far from the pill, there is a cave which has been partially explored. Col. Wood, F.G.S., employed a man (Richard Bowen), to dig here ; but the work proved unsatisfactory and was abandoned . Bills Orchard Cave. In the orchard belonging to Daniel Evans, of Hills, there is a cave, now filled up with rubbish ; one cannot speak positively as to its extent, as it has never been properly explored. Not far from this cave, and in the limestone quarry close to the farm house, the tenant, Daniel Evans, in quarrying the rock, came across a hoUow place filled with earth, in which the remains of two human skeletons were discovered. THE BULWARK. An account of this military work having already appeared in a preliminary chapter on the Danish occupation of Gower, I have only a few additional remarks to make upon it here. There is an early plan of it by Mr. Mat. Moggridge, F.G.S. The small tri angular tooking place within the camp to the eastward, is evidently modern, and probably nothing more than an enclosure made for the convenience of milking ewes, to save the trouble of driving them home from the mountain, a practice not uncommon, or peculiar to this locality. Some of the articles shown in the draw ings, represent certain rude implements found by me a few years ago in digging within the innermost part of the camp ; they were lying on a rough pavement of small flat stones, and along with them were teeth of cattle, pigs, and remains of charcoal. The spherical object of grey sandstone, had one part slightly hollowed, as if it had been used for pounding other substances, it was quite encrusted with burnt wood ashes. The other oblong stone imple-"], [203, "7 INCHES IN LEN-tb"], [204, ""], [205, ""], [206, "Weight, 6| Ibs. Sjf INCHES Weight, 2 Ibs. 1 oz."], [207, "59 ment, is probably a weapon of some kind, but an instrument that would answer divers purposes. By far the most interesting relics are the stone hammers and axes, said to have been found in this camp, and preserved at Stouthall. The one with a hole perforated in the centre, and one end curiously expanded, has been figured in Worsa\u0153s Anti quities, and Evan's ancient stone implements. It was presented by the late Col. J. N. Lucas to the Museum of the Royal Institu tion in Swansea, and was found by him lying in the window of a blacksmith's forge in the village of Llanmadoc. Mr. Evans remarks,* \" That axes with expanded ends like this, are more of the Scandinavian, and North German, than of the British form. His statement is a very important one, and tends to confirm what I have advanced in an earlier part of this work, on the Danish occupation of Gower, and the origin of the name of the camp on Llanmadoc Hill, where this relic was found. As I imagine Mr. Evans knew nothing of the Danish occupation of Gower, he will be pleased to learn, that what he says respecting the typical features of the particular axe-head in question, happens in this case to be singularly verified. Although in point of antiquity the introduction of these stone axes and axe hammers belong to a period beyond the range of history, it is a fact not generally known, that they were in use. until comparatively recent times; stone maulsf were used by the Saxons at the battle of Hastings, A.D., 1066, and in the thirty years war, the soldiers of Wallenstein and Tilly used the old stone hammers. By referring to the woodcut it will be seen, that one of these axes has the cutting edge, slightly blunted, at one end only, the other being rounded, with the shaft-hole (tapered) near that end. This class of weapon is not an uncommon form, and several are figured in Mr. Evans' able and compendious work. The other implement is of the adze-like form, not unusual, with the striking edge at right angles with the shaft hole. It is interesting to observe that in this small collection of old Vid. \"Ancient stone implements,\" by John Evans, F.B.S., F.S.A., p. 166, 1872. t Vide Kembles Hor \u00e6 Ferales. p, 74. I 2"], [208, "60 stone implements, we get a specimen of nearly all the different types of ancient stone axes used by our remote ancestors, and which Mr. Evans classifies under four heads. The disc with a hole in the centre, and the edges very much broken, is probably a weapon of some kind which has seen good service, unless it be what is called a spindle whorl. The bronze celt was not found at Llanmadoc, but at Pentre- bach, in the parish of Llandilo Talybont, in the debris of a deserted quarry. The reason why a drawing of it is given here, is, because it is said to resemble a great many, reported to have been dis- covered somewhere within the precincts of the parish of Llanmadoc, but whether in the bulwark or no I have been unable to learn. On my father showing it to an old man named Will Harry, of Porteynon, he said he had seen others like it, and that \" dozens of them were found at Llanmadoc.\" The metal of which this celt is composed, is a mixture of copper and tin. The usual proportions are, one of tin to ten of copper ; the tin rendered the metal harder, and less liable to oxidize. Vide Dr. Pearson's analysis, published in the philosophical transactions for 1796, p. 395. Perhaps the most rational conclusion we can come to about this particular form of so-called Celt, is, that they were axe heads fitted to handles, in the same way as the Indian tomahawk at the present day ; many examples of which are given by Evans in his admirable book on old flint implements. Some of them have a small loop cast on one side, and close to the socket ; many ex planations have been given as to the object of these loops, but their real meaning was unknown until the discovery of the Celt at Tadcaster, in Yorkshire ; this had a ring (made to open), and passed through the loop. The intention, therefore, of the loop was for passing a ring for the purpose of suspension by a strap ; in this manner the ancient warrior carried his battle-axe in the most convenient manner, and it was ready at hand either to cleave his enemy's skull, cut his own firewood, or shape his canoe ; with hatchet thus slung, his spear in his hand, and shield on his arm, he was fully equipped either for war or the chase. ( The drawing of a Celt thus fitted, and borne by an ancient Briton clothed in the skin of the brindled ox, is given in Sir Samuel"], [209, "FROM THE BULLWARK, LLANMADOC HILL. Weight, f lb.

In the account of the traditionary battle fought on Tankey Lake Moor \u2014 the flat ground between Llanmadoc HiU and Harding's Down, \u2014 and given in the First part of my history of West Gower, I omitted to mention, that the dead are stated to have been buried on the edge of the moor, and several mounds of earth are still pointed out as the site of tho places where they were interred. It would be interesting to examine these mounds, to test the truth of this part of the story ; I have often seen them, and they do not appear to have ever been disturbed. It is not impossible that some future explorer may find within the inner circle of this camp a human skeleton ; if so, he must be careful in deciding upon it ethnologically, for a rather curious history is attached to at least one human being, whose body was certainly interred there. During the incumbency of the Rev. Watkin Knight, who was Rector of this parish 1773 \u2014 1795, a thief was discovered smothered in the kitchen chimney of the Parsonage House. The story goes, that the servant girl in lighting the fire one morning, found that the smoke would not go up and jokingly remarked, \" There must be a man in the chimney,\" never thinking that such was really the case ; however, as the smoke did not ascend, the chimney was examined, and to the surprise of everybody, a man was found there, stuck fast, and quite dead. Having got the body up on the roof of the house, which was thatched at that time, they asked Mr. Knight who was conducting the proceedings, whether they should lower it by ropes or roll it down. He ordered them to throw it down, which was accordingly done. A consultation was then held as to where he should be buried, and it was decided that as he was a thief, and perhaps in intent a murderer, he should not be buried in the Churchyard, but on the top of Llanmadoc Hill, and a grave was dug in the \" Bound O,\" and there hewas interred, without the rites of Christian burial. I had this account from Mrs. Anne Button, since deceased, who also told me that when she was a little girl, it was a common custom among the young people to go on Sundays to visit the"], [212, "62 place in the \" Round 0,\" where it was said that \" Knights' John \" was buried.

I was informed by several old people that it was the invariable custom when anyone killed vermin, such as weasles, stoates, pole cats, &.C., to bring them to the churchyard, and nail them up in a certain ash tree. At the annual vestry meeting, held on Easter Monday, these animals were counted, and those who killed them were paid so much a-piece out of the church rate ; a guinea was allowed for a fox. WRECK OF THE BOUNTY HALL Early in the morning of December the 19th, 1819, an East Indiaman of 700 tons burden, called the Bounty Hall, came on shore on Llanmadoc Sands. The cargo consisted of rice, sugar, and spices. A certain green spot on the burrows is still pointed out where a large quantity of rice was landed. The vessel was got off. Mr. George Holland, of Cwm Ivy, was then Lloyd's agent, and receiver of droits for the Admiralty. WRECK OF SIXTEEN VESSELS IN BROUGHTON BAY. Probably the most dreadful maritime disaster that ever happened on this coast took place in Broughton Bay, on the night of January the 22nd, 1868, when no less than sixteen vessels varying from SO and 90 to 400 tons burden, were totally lost, and most of the crews perished. The disaster was caused by an extraordinary heavy ground sea, and the wind dying away. The ill-fated vessels, numbering about eighteen or nineteen sail, were outward bound from Llanelly. When they left that port they were unaware of this ground sea, which was not perceived until they reached Whitford Lighthouse ; here, however, one or two of them very prudently anchored ; but as there was a little wind, the rest, having been let go by the steam tug, supposed they would be able to clear the Burry Holms, and with the help of the ebb tide, make a good offing, in which case they would have been all right ; one or two only of the number were fortunate enough to do this, but before the remainder could clear the high land up to this point, the flood tide set in against them, and the wind died com pletely away; the result was they were drifted helplessly back, some dashing against the rocks, and some against each other, while"], [214, "64 a few sank in the middle of the river, having their bottoms knocked out by thumping on the sand ; for such was the extra ordinary character of the heavy swell that at one moment a vessel would be floating on the crest of a wave, and the next sweeping down its hollow, would be aground on the sand. At this time a Pilot ship, called the Hulk, was stationed in Broughton Bay, and taking to their boats a few of the crews of these unfortunate vessels managed to get on board of her, and remained there in safety until the morning. The dismal disaster happened between nine and ten o'clock at night, none of the people in the village being at all aware of the terrible catastrophe that was taking place so close at hand. In the morning \u2014 as may easily be sup posed \u2014 there was much excitement in the neighbourhood, and those who went down to the sands beheld a sight that will not soon be forgotten. From Whitford Sker to the Burry Holms, the shore was covered with seamen's clothes, broken spars, shattered hulls of stranded vessels, ropes, sails, tarpaulins, carpenters' tools, and vast quantities of coal, with which latter article the vessel* were laden. The bodies of the poor sailors, as they came on shore, were interred in the churchyards of the parishes where they were picked up. A rather remarkable and somewhat mysterious occurrence took place in connection with this wreck, which I cannot help men tioning. The choir of the Parish happened on the evening in question, to be holding their weekly practice in the church, when suddenly an indescribable scream of terror was heard in the churchyard, as of one in the last extremity of mortal fear. I immediately ran out to see what was the matter, and saw a young lad, whom I knew very well, standing in the middle of the walk, not far from the porch, with his face not only blanched, but actually distorted with fright. \" What is the matter, my lad 1\" I said. \" 0,\" he replied, \" I saw a man without his hat come and look in through the window.\" I brought the poor terrified lad into the church, where he remained some little time before he came to himself. It was currently believed that what he saw was the apparition of one of the poor seamen who was drowned, as it was just about the time when the wreck took place."], [215, ""], [216, "waa sis m. up gl <sip si? ski INBCEIPTION ON THE BELL OF LLANMADOC CHUECH."], [217, "65 WHALE WASHED ON SHORE ON THE LYNCH SANDS.

It is reported that Richard Gordon, Esq., ol Burry's Green, who was High Sheriff for the County in 1770, lent a carving knife to cut up the animal, whose oil realised a considerable sum. A few of the vertebr\u00e6 and ribs are still in existence ; two of the former are placed as the capping of a gateway to a cottage in Froglane, in this parish, but being white-washed over, no one would suspect what they really were. BLACK PINS IN THE SAND PIT. Until very lately, numbers of black pins used to be found in this pit, sometimes several dozen would be met with all stuck together in a mass, but no one can give any explanation which would account for their presence in this particular spot, which is not far from where the water runs out from under the rock, called \" Hot Wells,\" near Cwm Ivy Tor.

There were formerly two bells in the tower of this Chnrch, but one of them being cracked, it was at last \u2014 after lying about for some time \u2014 either stolen or the metal surreptitiously sold. There is a tradition that the present bell was cast in the parish during the incumbency of the Rev. George Harris. This, however^ must be an error, as Mr. Harris, according to an entry in the old Register Book, was presented to the living in 1722, while the date on the bell is 1675. One of the names on the bell is PhiUip Harris, hence, perhaps, the mistake. The story about its being cast in the parish may be true enough, as it was a common practice in the 17th and 18th centuries, when roads were bad, and con veyance difficult, for bell-founders to itinerate. Au order was given, and the bell-founder would come, set up his furnace in some convenient spot, cast a new beU, or re-cast the old one, and travel on to some other place. K"], [218, "66 ANCIENT QUADRANGULAR BELL. This curious old bell was ploughed up a few years ago in a field caUed Park-y-rodyn (the field of the kiln), near Cwm Ivy. It had originally been covered with a thin coat of some bright shiny substance, like gold, small portions of which still adhere to the thin iron shell ; the clapper is attached, but owing to a fracture in the side, the sounding properties of the bell are of course destroyed. It is very rudely made, and rivetted at the side, as shewn in the woodcut. The dimensions are : extreme height, 6J- inches ; width of the ends, 2\u00a3 inches ; width of the sides, four inches. This interesting relic is now in the possession of C. R. Mansel Talbot, Esq., M.P., and is preserved in the museum at Penrice Castle. Similar quadrangular bells have been found in Ireland, and some of the old Saxon priests bells were of this form. It is a circumstance that should be borne in mind' that all the saints of the sixth and seventh centuries invariably carried about with them bells, the virtues of which were sometimes manifested in a very surprising way ; an instance will be given in the life of St. Cennyd, the patron saint of Llangenith Church' who once worked a great deliverance in Gower and destroyed an army of soldiers by the mere sound of his bell. St. Madoc, the patron saint of Llanmadoc Church, had also a wonderful bell, the miraculous properties of which are frequently alluded to in the history of his life. The Irish account of the way in which he became possessed of this bell, and its preservation for more than a thousand years, are so very remarkable, that the following narra tive will not fail to interest some of my readers : \u2014 HISTORY OF ST. MADOC'S BELL. The Rev. Marcus Gervais Beresford, afterwards Lord Primate of Ireland, when Vicar oi Drung and Larah, in the County of Cavan, purchased from a man called Keleher two articles of great antiquarian interest, which conjointly bore the name of Clog Mogue * or the bell of St. Mogue. One of them was the principal surviving fragment of an extremely ancient Irish bell, which had been become disintegrated by corrosion ; and the other the * In Ireland St. Madoc is called St. Mogue."], [219, "QUADRANGULAR BELL, PLOUGHED UP IN A FrELD IN llanmadoc."], [220, ""], [221, "67 mutilated and partly dismantled cover or shrine, which at an early period had been made for the same bell. The man Keleher married the daughter of a Magoveran, the last in the male line of a long succession of hereditary keepers of this bell, whose abode was among the Slieve-an-Eirin mountains, to the north-east, between Tcmpleport and Fenagh. While this line of the Magoverans were to the fore, they kept the bell care fully rolled up in rags, and only exposed it when it was required in the parish of Templeport, or the neighbourhood, for the purpose of administering oaths upon, or of giving additional sanction to social compacts ; but when the Magoverans died out, and it passed into other hands, it acquired a marketable character, of which the collector availed himself, and obtained it at a price. The local tradition regarding the bell and its origin was to the following effect, as narrated by an intelligent schoolmaster, who lived about the time of its transfer, in the neighbourhood of Templeport Church. \"St. Killian (as Caillin is sometimes locally called) had at Fenagh a herd of oxen, which on a certain night strayed from their pastures, and in the morning were nowhere to be seen by the owner. Guided by inspiration, or led by an unseen hand, the Saint in his search for them arrived at the shore of Templeport lake, where they were found gazing earnestly towards the middle of the lake, and motionless like dogs setting game. The Saint inquired if anything strange or unusual had happened the night before ; and he was told that a travelling woman, a perfect stranger, had sought shelter at an early part of the night, and had been conveyed across to the island in the lake, where she had been safely delivered of a son, and that while in labour she had caught hold of the bed post, which presently threw down roots into the floor, and shot out branches upward, that protruded through the roof of the house. St. Killian ordered the boat to be put over to him, that he might cross to the island to baptize the child. The woman of the house made answer that the boat was not at hand, as her good man had gone a-fishing to a distant part of the lake. Whereupon the Saint, as well became him ! devoutly prayed that the man might never more set his foot on land. He next inquired if there was anything in the house upon which the k 2"], [222, "68 child might be floated across to him ; to which the woman replied that the only flat article in the house upon which the infant could be laid was a flag in the kitchen, which was used as a hearthstone. The Saint ordered her to fetch it to the water's edge. The woman said she could not lift it, and that if she did, it would serve to drown the child. \" Try it,\" said the Saint. She did so, and, to her surprise, carried it as if it were a bit of board to the desired place ; she laid it on the water ; lo ! it floated. She brought out the child and laid him upon the dry surface ; the wind arose, and, with a steady but gentle impulse, bore the buoyant flagstone to the opposite bank ; while the same wind which here was but a zephyr, raged as a storm elsewhere on tbe face of the lake, over- took the fisherman in an unguarded moment, capsized his boat, and committed him to a watery grave, as the Saint had prayed. This swimming flagstone was for ages preserved at Templeport, and was employed as a boat to ferry over dead bodies to the island for interment, till one day a young man and woman who happened to cross over upon it were guilty of some indiscretion in the transit, when the flagstone snapped in two, and one half of it sank, helping to drown the' inconsiderate couple, while the other half, of its own accord, floated away to the shore near Templeport Church. This half remained there for ages after ; and people who had suffered injury at their neighbours' hands used to go to it, and having diligently swept it, place a piece of sflver on it, then pray bad prayers against their enemies ; and so sure as they did, death or some other grievous calamity overtook the offender before twelve months were out. But to return to the child. The Saint awaited his arrival, took him up in his arms and baptized him with every mark of respect and veneration, giving him the name of Aedh ;* he then replaced him upon the flag, and giving it a gentle push, the child was sent to his mother as he had come, with this differ ence, that at his right side was found, resting on the slab, a con secrated bell, which bell after its employment in his maturer years, he left in the parish, and it was transmitted from Erenach to Erenach till the times grew bad, and their lauds were lost, and * Another name by which St. Madoc was known. His death is said to have taken place a. p. 624 (Irish account)."], [223, "69 the poor Magoverans, their representatives died out, and the Vicar of Drung got possession of it ; and that Vicar, as Lord Primate, allowed the Secretary of the Academy to exhibit it in memoriam, and also supplied him with this contribution towards a history of the vicissitudes of noble bells\" The beU was of iron. Three fragments remain, two of which are attached to the inside of the case, and the third is a flat piece of irregular form, which was originally part of the front or back. The case is of copper and was ornamented with silver plated bands, which were attached along the margins. On the front were two small figures, also plated with silver. One of these is wanting, but that which remains represents a habited ecclesiastic, holding a book at his breast. The case, which was probably a handsome object in its day, is very much injured, and now chiefly interesting as a curiosity.

TILPIN LAND. This piece of ground was once the property of the widow of the Rev. John Williams, Rector of Cheriton, and was let in 1790 to William Evans, \" containing by estimation about two acres, on which formerly there was a ruinous house, wherein John Morris formerly lived.\" In an old agreement in my possession, it is stated that Tilpin Lands formed part of the estate which the said John Williams bought of Walter Harries, Gentleman. He was probably one of the Harris's of Llanmadoc, but whose name does not appear in the pedigree. Inscription on the old Chalice of ihe Parish Church, Copied in 1864. POCVLVM ECCLESI\u00c6 DE LLANMADOCK The above inscription is not so legible now as it was a few years ago. It became necessary to have the cup mended, and the silversmith in repairing it obliterated the latter part of the word Llanmadoc. But having copied the legend before the repairs were executed, I am enabled to give it in its original form. Iu the year 1867 the Rev. R. Meux Benson, M.A., of Cowley, Oxford, presented a very handsome new silver Chalice and Paten to this Church. The Hall marks on the old Chalice aud its cover are a windmill, next something like a crown, a lion, and the letter G. CAIRNS ON LLANMADOC HILL, In the year 1867, in company with Mr. W. J. O'Donovan, L.L.D., I carefully examined this hill ; we then counted 19 cairns ; one on the side of a green path immediately over Lagadranta had the cist vaen exposed, but the capstone was gone. In the follow ing year, with Col. Morgan, R.A., and his son, Lieut. W. L. Morgan, R.E., I revisited this cist vaen, called by the common people the \"trough.\" After removing the vegetation and soil"], [227, ""], [228, "CIST VAEN ON THE NORTH-WEST SIDE OF LLANMADOC HILL. BOUNDARY CROSS FOUND IN THE WALL OF THE CHURCHYARD, LLANMADOC."], [229, "73 that had accumulated in the interior, we came to a hard floor of red clay, and found a few small portions of charcoal ; but as the place had been previously disturbed, we hardly expected to meet with any of the usual accompaniments of this mode of interment ; we thought perhaps we might have met with some fragments of pottery, but every vestige of this kind had disappeared. The dimensions ot this cist vaen are : length, 36 in., width, 18 in., depth, 12 in. On the ridge of the hill, and close to the camp, called the Bulwark, are a few Cairns, of unusually large size ; they have never been examined, and doubtless contain several cist vaens. Contiguous to these Cairns, are several deep pits. It is stated by some writers on Northern Antiquities, that the Danes were in the habit of digging such pits near their camps for the purpose of holding water ; it is not unlikely, therefore, that these excavations were made for this purpose by the occupants of this camp in ancient times. INCISED STONE. Found in the wall of Llanmadoc Church Yard, in 1864. The drawing is a correct representation of this stone found when rebuilding the wall ot the church yard. It is a very old and interesting ecclesiastical relic, and as far as I know, nothing like it has been met with in West Gower. But while the several features about it, show that it is of ancient date, the object for which it was originally made is not so easy to determine. It is a rectangular block of unhewn reddish stone, evidently brought from the adjoining hill, where many such are to be found. There is another and better sort of this kind of stone on the hill, but this particular block is of a hard and flinty nature, selected probably on this very account, for the better preservation of the stone itself and the carving upon it. There are two engraved surfaces ; on one side a rudely cut cross, with cross crosslets, and in the centre, at the intersection of the arms, what is called a nimbus, or glory, represented in the drawing by a circle. On the other side there is a cross of a some what different form. The remaining four sides are very rough and uneven, and have evidently never been touched with the chisel. L"], [230, "74 In all probability this was one of the old Boundary Crosses, which were set up in ancient times to mark the limits and divi sions of Church property, more particularly those of Abbey lands. When these landmarks stood in situ, the engraved part of the stone always faced the religious house to which they belonged. Fosbroke in his Antiquities, vol. i. p. 283, speaking of land marks, says \u2014 \" Crosses were usual with the Templars and Hos pitallers, and also with the King and laymen, but rather as de notations of property than boundaries.\" From the Charter of Margaret, Countess of Warwick, in 1156, confirmed by William de Breos, a.d. 1300, we learn that the village of Llanmadoc (Villa de Lanmadoc), with all its appurte nances, in plain, in pasture, and in water, &c, were given to the Knights Templars. When this Order was suppressed by the Pope in 1309, their immense possessions either reverted to the re presentatives of the original donors, or were appropriated to their more fortunate rivals, the Knights Hospitallers. It is therefore highly probable, that this stone was a boundary mark of one or other of these fraternities. In a medi\u00e6val chronicle called \" The History of Ingulf,\" there is a very interesting account given concerning the marking out the boundaries of the glebe land of the Monastery of Croyland, with stone crosses, by Turketull, the Abbot, a.d. 948, with the con sent of King Edred, who ratified and confirmed the land to the monks and their successors for ever.* It is there stated that marks of this description had been set up previous to that time by an earlier Abbot, named Kenulph, as mention is made of a certain boundary near the bank, on the opposite side of Southlake, where the first Abbot after the foundation, by name Kenulph, placed a stone cross for a boundary between Croyland and Depying. Many stone crosses having been swept away by being too near the rivers, Ttirketul ordered them to be renewed, and placed at a greater dis tance from the banks. It would appear from this account, that the custom of erecting stone crosses as boundary marks, was a very ancient and common practice. With regard to the date of this stone, we may say from what * Vide p. 6r3, \" History of Ingulf,\" edited by Bev. Joseph Stevenson, M.A. 1854."], [231, ""], [232, "OLD STONE CROSS FOUND IN LLANMADOC CHURCHYARD."], [233, "75 has been quoted from \"The History of Ingulf,\" and from Fos broke's statement about the Templars and Hospitallers, that it might be of any age, from the 8th. to the 16th century. The rudeness of the work betokening an early period need not neces sarily do so, as bad work can be found at all times, and here and there even in the 12th and 13th centuries, when the beautiful sculpture of our Abbeys and Cathedrals show the exquisite skill of the workmen of those days ; and therefore what I have said with respect to the age of this boundary stone is equally appli cable to the old stone cress found by me in the churchyard of this parish in the year 1864, and of which the woodcut is a faithful representation. It is made of grey sandstone, similar to that on Whitford Sker, whence it was probably obtained. The dimensions are \u2014 extreme length, 5 ft. 2 in. ; breadth across the arms, 18 in. ; breadth at the lower end, 21 in. ; thickness, 5 in. On one face of the stone, as shown in the drawing, there are some cuts, as if the artist wished to represent a ladder, aud under this traces of some thing resembling a hammer, but being almost obliterated by the action of the weather, it is difficult to make them out. There are examples of ancient crosses of this description, having what are called the Instruments of the Passion cut upon them ; and this may perhaps help us to fix the date of the Llanmadoc Cross. When found it formed part of a rude stone bench running along the outside of the south chancel wall. Several other flat stones lay along with it. This bench was doubtless made for the conve nience of the parishioners to sit tq_on when waiting for the arrival of the clergyman. It was customary some years ago to let him go into church first, the congregation following. The same order was observed in leaving. My impression is that this was the old churchyard cross, and that the other flat stones found along with it composed the steps at its foot ; that when the cross was takeD down, it was with its appurtenances, employed in the construction of the stone bench aforesaid. Nearly all the old crosses which stood in the villages and church yards in this county were destroyed by order of Oliver Cromwell. It is not unlikely that the one in question was the churchyard cross of the parish, and was taken down by the Puritans during l 2"], [234, "To the Commonwealth. It was at this time also that so many clergy of the Church of England were turned out of their livings, and suffered dreadful hardships. The then Rector of Llanmadoc, George Parry, A.M., who was also incumbent of the adjoining parish of Cheriton, shared the general fate, and was ejected to make way for an illiterate man named Jones. Parry was, how ever, re-instated at the Restoration. He was also Prebendary of Llandaff, but whether before or after the Rebellion is uncertain.* The principal object of the erection of the churchyard cross was to remind those who went to church of their duty to pray for the souls of those whose bodies were mouldering in the ground beneath their feet. I must now pass on to mention an object of much antiquarian interest \u2014 an old sepulchral stone \u2014 built into the wall of the Par sonage House, and discovered by me in 1861 when the building was undergoing some repairs. It is a rectangular Hock of red sandstone, 27 inches long and 8 inches square, hammer-dressed in a rough manner, the execution of the letters (Roman capitals) being of the rudest description. On submitting a rubbing to Professor J. 0. Westwood, he read the inscription as follows : \u2014 VECTI FILIVS GVAN HIC IACIT. That is \u2014 \" Gvan, son of Vectus, lies here.\" It belongs to what is called the Romano-British period. Mr. J. Rhys, Professor of Celtic Literature at Oxford, thinks its probable daie to be the fifth or sixth century. Until I had received the opinion of two such competent judges, I thought the first line of the inscription was one word \u2014 VICARIVS,\u2014 and the first word of the second line, SWAN, and Supposed that this was a sepulchral stone to the memory of a former incumbent named Swan, of whom there remained no other record ; but Mr. Westwood pointed out, that the top stroke of the second letter \u2014 evidently an E \u2014 was knocked off, and that the fourth letter was a T, with the top stroke also partially knocked off. There is a horizontal line connecting the T with the I ; but but it is very faint, and by no means certain whether it is a chisel Vide Walker's \" Sufferings of the Clergy,\" 1714, folio ed."], [235, "EARLY INSCRIBED STONE FOUND WALLED UP IN THE OLD PARSONAGE HOUSE, LLANMADOC."], [236, ""], [237, "77 mark or not. On further examination, this stroke appears to be a natural flaw in the stone, and no part of the lettering. This stone has been figured in Mr. Westwood's \" Lapidarium Walli\u00e6, 1877.\" I have no doubt he is right in reading GVAN rather than SWAN ; but a less experienced person would read it SWAN, as this old-fashioned G (if indeed it is a G) is so like our modern S ; and that it had been so read in former days I have very little doubt, hence the origin of the name of a small meadow, \u2014 \" Swan's Meadow\" \u2014 near the Church, where in all probability the stone was originally found, and where most likely it had stood for many ages before it was taken and used as a quoin stone in the parsonage house. In 1878, and soon after I had received the above reading from Mr. Westwood, Mr. Geo. G. Robinson, the active secretary of the Cambrian Arch\u00e6ological Association, in spected this stone, and drew my attention to the fragment of a letter like a D, preceding the V in VECTI. I ought to state, in justice to Mr. Westwood's plate of this stone, that it was entirely my fault in taking the rubbing from which he made his drawing, that this broken fragment of a letter was omitted. There is also one other slight inaccuracy. The last down stroke of the A in GVAN, ought not to be connected as in his drawing, with the N. Some of Hubner's* remarks on early inscribed stones are very interesting and of great value to arch\u00e6ologists in helping to fix the probable date of these ancient memorials. He suggests three methods by which the date may be approximately guessed. Tria sunt, unde talis qu\u00e6stio ordiri potest 1. \u2014 Res in titulis memorat\u00e6, i.e., the matter. 2. \u2014 Sermo eorum, i.e., the language. 3. \u2014 Literarum form\u00e6, i.e., the form of the letters. It appears to be agreed, (he says) that the more the inscriptions assume the true Roman form, the more ancient the stone, and the less they resemble that form, the more recent. He then gives numerous examples showing the great variety observable in the formulas of these inscriptions ; in many, according to an ancient Roman fashion, the names of both father and son were placed in the genitive case, as \" Sagrani fili Cunotami.\" * Inscriptiones Britannia; Christiana;, 1S76."], [238, "78 Like all the more ancient examples of the monuments of British Christians, we find on this Llanmadoc stone, the expression \" Hic jacit,\" for Hic jacet. Hubner remarking on this common formula, says : \" Tituli Britannici Christiani p\u00e6ne ad unum omnes dixeris unam tanturn habere formulam sollcmnem, qu\u00e6 est, hic jacet ;\" he then adds, that this formula, hic jacet, in the more ancient examples is written (ita flectitnr rustice) jacit. He states another fact which is well worth noting, namely, that by this expression, Hic jacet, or Hic jacit, we know that the sepulchre is that of a Christian. With regard to the form of the letters, he says, they are generally two, the capital letters (liter\u00e6 majuscul\u00e6), and the small letters (liter\u00e6 minuscul\u00e6), and of these, the inscriptions written in the capital letters may be taken as the oldest. The use of the small letters for inscriptions, he thinks began about the middle of the 8th century, and continued to the 10th. In 1876, I found it necessary to take down the old Rectory house, and build a new one on the same site ; in removing this interesting stone the workmen unfortunately let it fall, and tbe piece, represented by the fracture in the drawing, was broken off, it was, however, easily put together, and hating made everything secure with a band of iron, I have placed this venerable memorial of bygone times in the church. I need scarcely say, that Hubner's remarks on early inscribed stones, fully bear out Professors Westwood and Rhys in their opinion as to the great antiquity of this stone ; in the preservation of which \u2014 as one of the earliest known relics of the kind, and a proof of the existence of the Christian faith in Gower in the 6th century \u2014 I hope the parishioners of Llanmadoc will always take a special interest. In looking through the numerous examples of the early inscribed stones given in Hubner's learned work, already referred to, and those in Westwood's Lapidarium Walh\u00e6, one cannot fail to observe the brevity of the inscriptions, seldom exceedingly half-a-dozen words, in many cases two or three suffice for the memorial ; in the present instance we have only five words ; but short and simple a the inscription is, it shows that our Celtic forefathers in the 5th and 6th centuries, had a far better idea of what should be written on the tombs of departed friends than some of their descendants in"], [239, "79 the 19th. How much more becoming is this brief epitaph, than the long list of recorded virtues, so much in vogue fifty years ago ; and how much more suitable is the sentence, Hic jacet (here lyeth), so common in the old monuments, than the once familiar \" Sacred to the memory,\" (happily going out of date), so startling to those who know that nothing can be sacred to man, but only to God and his worship. The fulsomeness, and in many cases, utter want of truth in praising the dead, might well excuse the remark of the little girl, wbo after perusing the inscriptions in a certain church yard, observed to her mother, \" Dear Mamma, where do they bury all the wicked people.\" BRACKET ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE EAST WALL OF THE CHANCEL This was unfortunately broken off by the workmen engaged in the restoration of the building in 1865. It was a flat stone about 12 inches wide and 2 inches thick, standing out about 10 inches from the wall. The object of these brackets whenever they are found on the south side of the East wall, was to support an image of the patron saint of the church ; they are generally matched with a corresponding bracket on the north side, upon which was placed an image of the Blessed Virgin. While taking down the south side of the chancel wall, a curious hollow was disclosed, resembling a small flue, about 5 inches square, well cemented with mortar, and running straight down from the wall plate, through the thickness of the wall, but rather more to the outside than in the centre ; I traced it down about 5 or 6 feet, and then lost it about 3 or 4 feet from the ground. There was no appearance or smell of soot, the inside of the hole being perfectly white and clean, but so square and neat in its form, as to suggest the idea that it must have been built round a mould \u2014 as flues often are at the present day \u2014 which was gradually drawn up as the wall rose ; it was probably intended as a waste pipe to carry off the rain water. STONE WITH A CAVITY IN THE CENTRE FOUND IN RESTORING THE CHURCH This was found put in as an arch stone over a small square"], [240, "80 headed window (modern) on the south side of the Nave, and west ward of the porch. Dimensions of the stone : length, 13 inches ; breadth at the widest part, 12 inches ; thickness, 4 J inches. In the centre of the stone, on each side, and exactly opposite each other, but not meeting, are two small cup like cavities ; the dimensions of both are the same : diameter, 3 inches ; depth, 2 inches. The stone had evidently been mutilated and chipped by the mason to make it fit the place where it was found. I am quite unable to say what might have been the original use of this stone. WEATHER ADAGE. \" If Candlemas day is fair and fine, There's forty days of winter behind. This adage is not however confined to Gower, and is found in some parts of England in the following form : \u2014 \" If Candlemas day be fair and bright Winter will have another flight.\" In Scotland the prognostication is as foUows : \" If Candlemas* is fair and clear, There'll be twa winters in the year.\" Another weather prognostication current among the old people is to the following effect : \u2014 that wherever the wind happens to be on \" All Hallant Eve\" (i.e., 31st of October, the Eve of AU Saints Day), it will remain more or less in that quarter, or the direct opposite, for the next three months. BROAD FACED SHILLING OF HENRY VIII. This coin was found by the clerk when digging a grave in Llanmadoc Church yard, and I happened to be standing by when it was thrown up. It is called by Rapin, \"The Broad faced shilling of baser allay of Henry VIII. ; and has on the obverse : Henrie. viii. di. gra. angl. fraz. hib. rex. ; on the reverse : posvi : devm : adjvtorem metm. The obverse has the full face of Henry, crowned ; on the reverse there is a rose, crowned, with H.B., likewise crowned. * Candlemas is the 2nd of February."], [241, "BTONE FOUND OVEE A WINDOW IN LLANMADOC CHUBCH."], [242, ""], [243, "81 GLASS BEAD FOUND BY JOHN POWELL IN A FIELD AT LAGADBANTA.* These glass beads which are occasionally picked up in Wales must not be confounded with the Glain Kaidr, or serpent's egg, which was more of a ring than a bead, and produced, it is said, from the froth or saliva of a number of snakes rolling themselves together. This froth by the hissing of the serpents was blown up in the air, and caught in a mantle before it touched the ground. It was preserved by the Druids as the most precious thing. Set in gold, the Arch Druid wore it round his waist on solemn occa sions. Mr. B. Jones, of Goring Place, Llanelly, has one of these rings in his possession. The proving the Glain Naidr was a very imposing ceremony. It was brought out with its gold setting and placed on the water ; if it floated, it was a true Glain Naidr ; if it sank, it was rejected. As the Druids consulted it by way of augury, it corresponded in a measure to the Urim and Thummim of the Jewish High Priest \u2014 a mysterious mode of ascertaining the will of God, but about which there is now nothing known for certain. These glass beads are still considered to possess certain virtues, chiefly of a healing nature, and are sometimes called \" She stones,\" from a supposition that they will remove a stye (called a she) if applied to the eye. Mrs. Francis Bevan, of Llanmadoc, has one of these beads, which has been in possession of her family for several generations. She told me that some years ago \u00a35 had been offered for it, but that the then owner would not part with it. This bead is not quite so large as the one found at Laga dranta, but resembles it in every other respect, being perforated, and of a dusky smoky colour, and about the size of a marble. I should here mention that it was the general belief of the old people that whoever found a Glain Naidr was sure to prosper in all his undertakings. \u00bb This is evidently a corruption of the Welsh word Llygadnentydd, meaning the source (literally, the eye) of the springs, a name which very correctly describes the nature of the locality, which abounds in springs of water. The word is compounded of Uygad, an eye, and nentydd (plu.), spring., frjjm naut (sing.) In Welsh, \" well-head\" to this day is llygad-y-ffynnon. M"], [244, "82 THE HAUNTED WELL AT LAGADRANTA. About one hundred years ago, a little old woman called at a farmhouse at Langadranta, and asked for the loan of a sieve, which, as my informant gravely remarked, \" was to sifty gold, you know.\" The mistress of the house told her that she had not got such a thing. \" Yes, you have,\" said the other ; and it is now over the vat straining the hops.\" Suspecting from this that she was one of the \"Very* folks,\" the sieve was handed to her imme diately. Some days after this she returned, bringing the sieve with her. \" Here.\" say i si is your sieve ; and as you were so good \u25a0 . to lend it me, the biggest cask in your house shaU never hout beer.\" She then left, and being watched, was seen to the well and disappear. This was the story as I first heard it related ; but another ver- sion very similar to the above, gives the reason why the supply of beer was stopped. The fairy (for such she was) had laid it down as a condition, that the mistress of the house should never mention what had been told her. Of course she could not keep the secret, and after that the cask was soon empty. The household at Lagadranta, for some reason or other, seems to have been in great favour with the \" good people,\" for not only did that happen which is related about the beer, but a short time previous, a servant girl belonging to the house used to find a new shilling in her pail every morning before she went to milk. This continued for some time, till at last, thinking it might be a trick of her employers to test her honesty, she men tioned the circumstance to them ; but as everyone denied all knowledge of it, it was put down to the \" Very folks.\" The girl, however, never had any more shillings. It seems to have been a rule among the \" good people\" to discontinue their kind offices whenever the recipients of their favours spoke of them to any other person. I once asked an old woman, who was over ninety years of age, and knew many things about the \" Very folks,\" if she could give any reason how it was that they were never seen now.

There they are supposed to be the angels who stood neuter when Satan rebelled against Jehovah, and that their destiny, which is now unknown, will be fixed at the Day of Judgment. While dwelling on this subject, I must not forget to mention the fairy ground at the foot of Cwm Ivy Tor. This used to be a very favourite spot for the little people to meet in former days, As in other places so here, their usual employment was dancing, and they were frequently seen on moonlight nights enjoying themselves in this way, frisking about, and all dressed in scarlet and green. It was, however, very dangerous to interfere with them on these occasions. A story is told of a man who once upon a time was bold enough to step into the ring where they were dancing, and was immediately ran through the foot with a fork. He was lame for many days, and could get no ease, tiU at last he consulted a wise woman, who told him to go and humbly put his foot again in the ring where he had the hurt, he did so, and he soon got weU. CURIOUS CUSTOM OBSERVED IN THIS PARISH ON ST. STEPHEN'S DAY, DECEMBER 26th. On this day the small boys of the village go about with bunches of holly (here called, holms), and pursue all the women they meet, and scratch them, they also call at the houses, and do the same to all the female inmates. This custom is called \"holming,\" and the day, \" Holming Day.\" Its origin may perhaps may be found in the death of St. Stephen, the first Christian martyr, whose blood was shed on this day for the faith of Christ. Wl Williams, of Llanmadoc, who has been bedridden for many year informed me, that he remembered an old man living at Pern who always holmed himself on this day until the Brand, in his observations on popular antiquities, speaks of the practise of bleeding horses on St. Stephen's Day, but does not allude to the custom of holming. m 2"], [248, "84 THE HORSE'S HEAD. The custom of going about with the Horse's Head at Christ mas time is not peculiar to Wales, and answers to what in Kent is called \" Hodening,\" the Welsh call it Mary Llwyd. \"At Ramsgate, they begin the festivities of Christmas by a curious musical procession. A party of young people procure the skull of a horse which is affixed to a pole about four feet long ; a string is tied to the lower jaw, and a horsecloth is attached to the whole, under which one of the party gets, aud by frequently pulling the string keeps up a loud snapping noise, and is accom panied by the rest of the party grotesquely dressed and ringing hand bells. They thus proceed from house to house sounding their bells and singing carols. This is provincially called a \" Hodening,\" and the figure described above, as a \" hoden,\" or \" wooden horse.\" This curious ceremony is also observe in the Isle of Thanet on Christmas Eve, and is supposed to be an ancient relic of a festival ordained to commemorate our Saxon ancestors landing in that island. \" Vid Hone's every day book vol. ii. p. 1642. The practice is still kept up in Gower. Here the horse's head is profusely decorated with gay coloured ribbons, and a white sheet being attached to it, a lad gets underneath, the head being supported in the manner described above ; a halter fitted to the skull is held by one of the party, who then go round the village, caUing at the houses ; the person concealed by the sheet causes much amusement and some terror to the inmates, by making the head snap and bite in every direction. The quaint old carol called, \"The twelve joys of Mary,\" is usuaUy sung. It is not unlikely that this curious custom of going about at Christmas time with the horse's head, may have some allusion to the birth of Our Saviour in the stable at Bethlehem. 1 should mention, that when the Christmas festivities are over, these gamesome youngsters with mock gravity, bury the horse's head in some very secret place, known only to themselves, and at the ensuing Christmas dig it up again, and thus the same skuU is made to do duty for many years."], [249, "85 CHRISTMAS PLAY OF ST. GEORGE This Christmas play, or sport (as it is called in Gower), is almost identical with the Christmas drama of St. George as acted in Cornwall ; an account of which may be found in Hone's, every day book vol. ii. p. 122. The performers \u2014 some with ribbons in their caps, and wearing white trousers \u2014 carry wooden swords in their hands.

He then goes out, and enters the Turkish knight \u2014 Here comes I, a Turkish knight, Come from the Turkish land to fight ; And if St. George will meet me here, I'll try his courage without fear. Enter St. George \u2014 Here comes I, St. George, That worthy champion bold ; And with my sword and spear I won three crowns of gold. I fought the dragon bold, And brought him to the slaughter By that I gained fair Sabra, The King of Egypt's daughter."], [250, "86 Turkish knight speaks \u2014 St. George, I pray thee, be not so bold, If thy blood be hot, I'll soon make it cold. St. George replies \u2014 Thou Turkish knight, I pray forbear ; I'll make thee dread my swrord and spear. They fight desperately, and the Turkish knight falls. St. George speaks \u2014 I have a little bottle, they call it elecampane, If the man's alive, let him fight again. The knight rises on one knee and fights feebly, but is again struck down. The Turkish knight speaks \u2014 Oh ! pardon me, St. George ; oh ! pardon me, I crave ; Oh ! pardon me this once, and I will be thy slave. St. George replies \u2014 I'U never pardon a Turkish knight, Therefore arise and try thy might. The Turkish knight renews the combat, but faUs again grievously hurt. St. George speaks \u2014 Is there a doctor to be found, To cure this man of his deadly wound ? Enter Doctor \u2014 Oh ! yes, there's a doctor to be found To cure a deep anddeadly wound. St. George \u2014 What can you cure ? Doctor \u2014 I can cure the itch, the palsy, and the gout, If the devil's in him, I'U pull him out. The doctor then applies a magic vial to the Turkish knight's nose, who immediately gets up and goes out. One of the party now goes round with a hat, and all retire.

His death took place in 1074. In his will \u2014 a copy of which is given in Col. G. G.

Further on in the will, he speaks of his tenements of \" Gawlooch and Cwm Ivy,\" to be held by his son Oliver, under certain conditions. Whether the tenement described above as Cwm Ivy, is Cwm Ivy in the parish of Llan madoc, is not absolutely certain, as the situation is not given, and there is no place now known as Gawlooch in this parish.

The foUowing letter appeared in yesterday's Times : \u2014 \" Sir, \u2014 Will you permit me to occupy a small portion of the Times, that I may publish the following remarkable statistics of the length of days to which the people of this part of the peninsula of Gower attain, for I very much doubt if any parish in the United Kingdom can afford so wonderful an example of longevity. \" The average population of the united parishes of Llanmadoc and Cheriton within the last hundred years is 560. From the year 1813 (when the Regulation Burial Eegisters were ordered to be used) to the present time, there have been 527 people buried in the two yards nearly the same number in each. Of these 230 were under 30 years of age ; 32 between 30 and 40 ; 24 over 40 ; 36 over 50 ; 47 over 60 ; 72 over 70 ; 66 over 80 ; 18 over 90 ; and 2 over 100 years. That is to say out of 527 persons, 158 were over 70 years of age, or nearly 30 per cent, of the entire number, and those who died between 60 and 90 are more than double the number of those aged from 30 to 60. \" If any parish can compare with this I trust the statistics will be published. \" I am, Sir, your obedient servant, \" Charles E.

Lewis, in his \" Topographical Dictionary of Wales,\" says \u2014 \" This place, according to some, derived its name from the quantity of cherry trees abounding in the neighbour hood, and which formerly grew wild in the hedges.\" It is written Cherytown (sic) in a grant to John Farnham, Armiger, of certain lands in the parishes of Rhosili, Reynoldston, and Cherytown, temp. 22 of Queen Elizabeth. There are certainly several cherry trees still in existence, and a few of them from their size must be very old ; one of these, blown down a few years ago, measured six feet in circumference three feet from the ground. Others think that the more probable origin of the name is Churchtown. Those who incline to this opinion say that wherever there is a Cheriton, a hamlet is found in connection with it, which is the case here, Llandimor, though quite a separate village, about three quarters of a mile distant, being in the parish of Cheriton. In an old indenture in my possession, dated 1657, it is written Cheringtone. The earliest mention of it that I have yet met with under the present name is in the 14th century, in connection with a notice of Sir Roger de la Bere,* who is described of Cheriton and Llan genydd, temp. Ed. III. His grand-daughter, Elizabeth, married David Cradock, of Cheriton. It is thus mentioned in the \"Valor Ecclesiasticus,\" cir. 1536, temp. Henry VIII. , where it is stated that the knights of S. John of Jerusalem had the right of presentation to the Church. The name of the then rector (David Jones), and the value of the living, are also given : \u2014 Decanatus de Gower infra Archid' Kermerdyn Cheryton David Jones rcor ibidem ad collaconem\") \u00a3 s. d. predcam spectan9 coibu3 ann9 val3 J ix vij iij Inde xa - - -.-. xviij viij ob9 q9 * Vid. \"Contributions towards a Cartulary ol Margam,\" by G.

John of Jerusalem, who had a Commandery at Slebeche, in Pembrokeshire, and to whom grants of many of the Gower Churches had been made. It would appear, therefore, from the foregoing extract, that Cheriton Church belonged to this rich fraternity. It is not, however, mentioned in the hst of Gower Churches given in the Confirmation of Bishop Ansehn, a.d. 1230, and was probably a later donation. There is some reason for thinking that the ancient Welsh name of Cheriton might have been Thorendreff. I have met with this word in a Latin document dated a.d. 1352, temp. Ed. III., preserved at Penrice Castle ; and from the description of the locality \u2014 \" Within the fee of Llandimor \" \u2014 it is possible that the village of Cheriton might be intended, and that Tho rendreff was the old Welsh name of the place. Cheriton is obviously English, but it can hardly be derived from Thorendreff, though the last syllable (Tref) means town, as there are several Cheritons elsewhere, one in Pembrokeshire, and others in England. I cannot say what might be the exact date of Mr. Clarke's paper (temp. Ed. III.), in which he finds the present name of Cheriton so written ; but in the same king's reign, a.d. 1352, the date of the deed alluded to above, this name Thorendreff is mentioned. In another Latin document, dated a.d. 1399-1400, which will be given at fuU length further on in the notices of this parish, Tho rendreff, written Torrendrew (evidently the same word) frequently occurs, and here also described as being within the fee of Llan- dimor. There is now no place known as Thorendreff, or Torrendrew, in the parish of Cheriton, which parish I should mention is com prised within the manor of Llandimor. This name seems to have been completely lost in the neighbourhood ; but as the extensive manor of Llandimor contained within its bounds portions of the parishes of Llanrhidian and Rhosili, it is not impossible that it may allude to some place in one or other of those parishes ; but"], [265, ""], [266, "FLEMISH CHIMNEY STACK, CHERITON GLEBE HOUSE. CORBEL fOEBEL OF STACK."], [267, "99 on making diligent inquiry, I find that the name is unknown there. . I once thought as a possible derivation of the name (Cheriton) from a Welsh word, that it might have been originaUy Cyric's town, Cyric* being an early British saint of the 7th century, and that the place took its name from him, just as Kenegstone, in the adjoining parish of Llangennith, is Cennyd's-town, S. Cemiyd being the patron saint of Llangennith Church. If such a con jecture be correct, Cheriton Church would be under the invocation of S. Cyric ; but Brown Willis, in his \" Survey of S. Davids,\" a.d. 1717, places it under that of S. Cattwg, and notices it as follows :\u2014 \" Cheriton, R. S. Cadocus.\" There is, however, one very strong objection in assigning so early a date as the 7th century to this Church, namely, that there is no Cheriton Mapsant known to the old people. The festival is annually kept up, and called from time immemorial Llandimor Mapsant, and is always celebrated in that viUage. It would seem from this that Llandimor was originally the Parish Church, and that when Cheriton Church was built, that at Llandimor having been abandoned, owing probably to the encroachment of the sea, the Llandimor Mapsant (on the 4th of February) was retained, and made to do duty for both places. The idea of the prior antiquity of Llandimor derives some confirmation from the circumstance that Llandimor is spoken of in the survey called the \" Taxatio Ecclesiastica\" of Pope Nicolas IV., a.d. 1291, but there is no mention whatever of Cheriton. We may, therefore, venture to assume from this, that in 1291 there was no Church at Cheriton ; and if such was the case, the opinion of those who impute so early a date as the 13 th century to this Church can hardly be correct. It might be the 14th, and if so would correspond with the conventual buildings called the Glebe-house, adjoining the churchyard, and supposed to be 14th century work. But I do not wish to speak positively on this point. Mr. Ed. Freeman, F.S.A., attributes it to the 13th cen tury, and the opinion of so eminent an authority must have great * He flourished from 664 to 700, . id. \" Essays on the Welsh Saints,\" by the Revd. Rice Rees, M.A., 1836, p. 307. o 2"], [268, "100 weight. It is, however, a fact worth noting, that we have at Cheriton a type of church unique in Gower, possessing more ele gancies of art than any of the others, and perfect in point of con struction, the tripartite division of nave, choir, and chancel, being most distinctly marked out by the singularly beautiful feature of a central tower. In 1861 the Cambrian Arch\u00e6ological Society visited this Church, and Mr. Edward Freeman, in the course of an interesting lecture on the architecture of the edifice, observed that this three fold division of nave, choir, and chancel, was always carried out in ecclesiastical buildings of the middle ages. It mattered not whether it was a Cathedral, Abbey, Minster, or Village Church, the [old architects, who knew their work so well, invariably bore this principle in mind, and that in the present instance it was well brought out, the nave for the people, the choir for the clergy, and the chancel for the highest offices. Just beneath the battlements of the tower, which has a saddle back roof within the parapet, there are numerous square holes, re sembling put-log holes, and quite through the thickness of the walls. These apertures have given rise to many conjectures as to their object. It is now supposed that they were used for inserting beams to carry a sort of platform for fighting purposes, in case ol a siege. In short, without some contrivance of this kind, the narrow space between the inner side of the parapet and the eaves of the roof, at most not more than eighteen inches wide, would be practically useless for defensive purposes ; but with this balcony, which could be quickly formed, there would be at once a conve nient stage to meet every requirement. During the Norman civil wars, between Matilda, daughter of Henry I., and Stephen, Thierry, quoting \" Gesta Stephani regis, p. 951, Gervas Cantuar. Chron. apud Hist. Angl. Script., ii. col., 1366, ed. Selden,\" states that the English about this time (1153), flying from their houses, either through constraint or fear, built themselves huts adjoining the walls of the churches ; but from these they were speedily expeUed by one or other faction, who turned the churches into fortresses, embattled the steeples, and placed thereon batteries of their engines of war. The words of Gervase are \u2014 \" Alii circa templa spe videlicet se tutandi humUia"], [269, "101 contexentes tuguna. De turri unde dulces et imbelles attdieraut tintinnabulorum monitus nunc balistas erigi.\" The Font. The present one is octagonal, and made of freestone. This form is of very ancient date, and many of the old fonts are made in this shape. The number eight was considered a mystical num ber. The idea of the eight-sided font was probably taken from the eighth, or baptismal day, among the Jews, hence the Christian font of that shape, and the following lines of St. Ambrose : \u2014 *\" Octachorum sanctos templum surrexit in usus, Octogonus sons est munere dignus eo. Hoc numero decuit sacri baptismatis aulam Surgere, quo populis vera salus rediit.\" Which, translated into English, may be read as follows : \u2014 \" Eight arched (or chambered) for holy purposes the temple rose. Eight angled is the font of that edifice worthy. Of this number ought the home of holy baptism to have risen. By which to the nations true life returned.\" An ancient font \u2014 tub-shaped, \u2014 with a large piece broken out of it, lies outside the porch ; but whether this was the original font, or brought here from the extinct church of Llandimor, there are at present no means of knowing. In the years 1874 and 1875, when the Church was being restored, some very interesting discoveries were made. On removing the slating from the chancel roof, which abuts the east wall of the tower, a chimney flue was discovered, fuU of soot ; the opening was just where the slating joined the wall. There was no trace inside the tower of any fire-place. Chimneys in church towers were not uncommon in the 13th and 14th centuries. Remains of cockle and mussel shells, with traces of fire, charcoal, &c, wrere found at the \"same time (1874) under the floor, at the wrest end of the nave, and within the building ; but \"as I have already alluded to this circum stance, and given an explanation of it in_my notices of Llanmadoc, there is no occasion for saying anything further about it here. Perhaps the most interesting relic brought to light in restoring * Vid. S. Anibrosius in inscrip. ad Fontem S. Teclae Mediolani. Du CaDge. Gloss."], [270, "102 the Church was the discovery of a freestone slab, 5 ft. long, 2 ft. 3 in. wide, and about 8 in. thick, which had once probably been the top of the pre-Reformation altar of this Church. It had been employed to form part of a step in the chancel, and had a large piece broken off one corner. The top side was smooth, and the under one rough-bedded. The two ends and one side were chamfered, as shown in the woodcut, whde the other was cut quite square, plainly showing that it was intended to be placed against a wall. On the three remaining corners were indications of what were once probably small incised crosses, but which from. the lapse of time and the exposed situation of the stone, were in two cases fretted out of all shape, and nothing but mere holes ; in the third corner faint chisel marks could be traced. In the centre of the stone there was also an irregular cavity. These I take to be the remains of the five crosses with which all those old altar stones were invariably marked. I am the more inclined to think that I am right in my conjecture as to the original use of this stone as there is a similar one, about the same size, in Pyle Church, Glamorganshire, where it forms the step of the belfry doorway.* When all the fixed stone altars were thrown down at the Re formation, what is termed the mensa of the altar was often put to the above-mentioned use. Sometimes it was employed to floor the church, and occasionally it has been found converted into a tomb stone ; and from some faint traces of letters it would seem as if this stone had once been so converted. I had it carefttUy re moved, placing it as nearly as possible in its former situation, and the present altar stands upon it. In the year 1868, when laying out the churchyard, which had got into a very untidy state, the workmen met with a deposit of cockle shells extending all the way from the Parsonage House to the gateway of the Church. These shells must have been lying here for a very long time, as in some places they were covered with at least two feet of earth, and this in a part of the yard that had never been disturbed by graves. The cockles had evidently * I tound it so placed in 1878. It is in the most perfect condition, and I strongly commend it to the notice of the Secretary of the Cambrian Arch\u00e6ological Society."], [271, "END SECTION. ALTAR STONE, CHERITON CHURCH."], [272, ""], [273, "103 been cooked, and probably eaten, where the shells were found, as traces of fire, charcoal, &c, were everywhere to be seen. It seems likely that this accumulation of shells is contemporaneous with others of a similar kind found round the cliffs at Llandimor, in Llanmadoc burrows, and Weobley wood. It is, however, curious to find these Kjooken Moddiug* in a churchyard. I have been informed that the same thing has been discovered at Llangennith. The usual answer of the inhabitants when asked if they can give any account of these remains is always the same\u2014\" There was a great famine in them times.\" The quantity of cockles consumed must have been very great, as the deposit of shells was in some places quite two feet deep, five yards broad, and fourteen yards long. Mr. John Gordon, farmer, of Llandimor, to whom I showed this cockle-sheU bed, gave me a very ingenious and original explanation as to the fact of its being in the churchyard. His idea was, that when the famine was sore hi the land, and every kind of food very scarce, these cockles were brought to the Church to be divided, so that there might be no disputing, and everyone have his proper share. Amongst the shells were a few burnt bonesT, which seemed to be those of cattle. I also found a round stone, about the size of a large orange, very much blackened by fire, and with wood ashes adhering to it. There were great quantities of ashes everywhere, all of wood, with the exception of one solitary fragment of some kind of spurious coal. I ought to mention that along with the cockle sheUs there were a great many sheUs of periwinkles, limpets, and a few mussel shells. Several small flat sandstone tiles were dug up in different parts of the yard, with holes in them, the Church having evidently been roofed with them in former times. When the Church was being restored,! the porch was found to be in such a bad state that a new one had to be built. In the old porch, on the right hand side going in, and at the extreme end of a rude stone bench of rubble work, and close to the inner door, I found the site of the old holy water stoup. The stoup itself was gone, and aU that remained was a shattered cavity, where it had * A Danish expression, meaning Kitchen Midding, i.e., a refuse heap. t From plans hy Mr. John Prichard, of LlandaS"], [274, "104 once been fixed. This place was more raised than the other part of the bench, and formed a kind of step, like that at Penrice where the stoup remains. Immediately over the doorway of the porch there was an old window place, blocked up with masonry ; but as the opening had been merely closed with a single sheer of stones flush with the wall on the outside, a large portion of the interior was always visible. It was a plain rectangular opening, splayed on the inside, and about two feet high by one foot wide externally. As church porches were occasionally used as schoolrooms, it is very likely that this opening was made for inserting a window, unless there was a parvis in this porch in former times, where the monk slept who looked after the Church and kept the keys. On the side of the right hand jamb of the inner doorway, I found, after scraping off the whitewash, five incised crosses, cut one above another, on five separate blocks of stone. One of these stones was so shattered that it had to be taken out, and a new one put in. It is my intention to cut a fresh cross upon this block in order to restore an interesting ancient feature. There is little doubt that these marks are what are called Con secration Crosses. At Caldicott Parish Church (Monmouthshire), the Vicar, the Rev. E. Turberville Williams, showed me one cross, cut in slight relief, but otherwise similar in size and shape to the Cheriton crosses. This was also on the jamb of the inner door way, and on the right hand side. They are frequently met with in this Situation. Durandus, in his treatise on symbolism, written in the 13th century, mentions twelve crosses painted on the four walls, with lamps burning before them, and that at the time of the consecration of the building these crosses are anointed with chrism. The Rood Loft. As in Llanmadoc and several other Gower churches, so here. the narrow aperture high up in the wall, dividing the nave from the choir, shows the entrance to the Rood Loft, a portion of which, consisting of one solitary oak beam, remained in situ until about thirty years ago, when it was taken down, and cut up into short lengths to make joists for the floor when the Church was re seated at that time. The parish clerk (Daniel HuUin), who"], [275, ""], [276, "TEANSVEBSE SECTION OF ROOD BEAM, CHEEITON CHTJBCH. STENCILLING FROM THE CHANCEL OF CHERITON CHURCH."], [277, "105 assisted in taking it down, told me that it was handsomely moulded, and had some parts gilt. Bearing this story in mind, when the Church was being restored I searched carefully for this interesting old relic, and found it, as I had been informed, cut up into joists. From lying in the earth, and its great age, much of it was in a decayed state ; but some portions remained quite sound, showing the mouldings as given in' the woodcut. There were some traces of a pink colour here -and there, but the original gilding was quite gone. A short account of the antiquity of Rood Lofts, and the purpose for which they weie erected, will be found in the notices of Llanmadoc parish. In removing the whitewash from the walls of the chancel, numerous inscriptions, some in Latin, others in English, were met with. These had been obliterated with whitewash, which had again been written on ; but though I took the greatest pains in trying to recover the writing, I was only able to preserve some broken fragments of letters. After all the whitewash had been scraped off, a coat of exces sively hard plastering was disclosed, on which was stencilled bunches of grapes the natural size. The fruit was coloured bright red, the stems of the vines black, and some of them grey. There wa3 also a background of a light purple tinge. I should mention that this design only appeared on the south and east waUs. From some cause or other the work had been left unfinished ; but there could be no doubt that it was the intention of the painter to diaper the whole of the interior with this pattern, as the purple priming was laid on, but without any continuation of the device. It appears from investigations of the catacomhs at Rome \u2014 the retreats of the Christians during the early persecutions \u2014 that the representations of the spreading vine, and the gathering of grapes, are not uncommon, and may be supposed to symbolize the joyous ness of the Christian faith, with a probable allusion also to the \u25a0ftj_y-Etteha_.ist. Chi On finding these interesting old paintings I imagined I had met with the original ornamentation of the walls. Such, however, was not the case, for underlying the above, and with about three quarters of an inch of plastering between them, I came upon another design, of a totally different character, which proved to p"], [278, "106 be the earliest decoration, and covered the whole of the chancel. This pattern was done with less appearance of art than the other, but was very pretty and effective. The tint of the background in this case was that which is so frequently found in ancient sten cillings, namely, the colour of old parchment. The resemblance will be immediately perceived between this pattern and that discovered on the north wall of the choir. The design is nearly the same. In the latter the block-markings are square, and only one colour (black) was used. In the former the block-markings* are more oblong, and the colour light red. The flowers were all painted bright scarlet, and the stems alternately black and light red. I observed in all the paintings here, and at Llanmadoc, that some kind of transparent silicious compound had been used, probably to preserve the paint from the effects of damp, and in some cases presented a shiny appearance, like gum or varnish. In this wash \u2014 whatever it was \u2014 lies the probable secret of the preservation of these ancient paintings, which, after an interval of four or five hundred years, were found as bright and vivid as the day they were done. To look at them, you might have fancied they were only finished yesterday, instead of centuries ago. It is, there fore, in vain to say that it is the humidity of our climate that prevents the permanency of such work now-a-days, for here we have a plain proof to the contrary. The fact is, that the pre paration of this composition, which alone renders the work of the artist lasting, has been lost, hence so many unfortunate failures. It is most painful to see the beautiful paintings delineated by living artists on the walls of churches and in some of our public buildings, such as the present houses of Parliament, fading away in the course of a few years. Men can draw and paint on bare waUs as well as ever, but they no longer possess the art of rendering their work durable. We may however indulge the hope that this long lost secret will some day be discovered ; but it does seem SDmewhat strange that among the many marvellous discoveries \u00bb This is not an uncommon 13th century pattern. A similar design was found in a blocked-up lancet window in the chancel of Great Brick-hill Church, Bucks. Vid.

VioUet le Due, the great French architect, uses as a solution, the pre paration of which he has not divulged, and employs it largely in his work on the Continent. Mr. B. BncknaU, who studied under him, informed me that it becomes so hard that if laid on steps, the wear and tear of hob-nailed boots make no impression on it. Time will show whether it will successfully resist that great enemy damp, and if so, it is to be hoped that so valuable a secret wiU not perish with the inventor. The stencilling on the north side of the choir was discovered on removing some stone steps leading up to the belfry ; these steps were of the roughest and rudest kind, nothing more than a block of rubble work in a stepped form built up against the side of the tower ; from the uppermost of these steps a wooden ladder \u2014 always visible \u2014 projected into a manhole in the belfry loft : in short it was a churchwarden's contrivance for getting admission to the tower to effect any necessary repairs. A casual visitor might have thought, and I believe it had been suggested that this was the staircase to the Rood Loft ; of course, there was a stair case to the Rood Loft of Cheriton Church, but this was not the one ; it was such a clumsy affair that it was quite impossible to make it harmonize with all the other indications of elegance and art to be seen in this Church However, all doubt on this point has now been entirely removed, for on taking away this most unsightly object, a large patch of stenciUing on a fairly plastered waU came to light. Several rectangular panels four feet high, and six feet long, were found painted on the walls of the nave on the north and south sides, in the foUowing colours, yellow ochre, light red, black, grey, and white ; within the compartments there were passages of scripture in the old black letter character, and done probably in the time of Edward VI., or Queen Elizabeth. Fragments of bordering formed by an interlinking of Chinese looking characters, and precisely the same as those found in Llanmadoc Church, were also found here. On the wall of the west end of the nave, two grotesque human figures had been painted, but I could not quite make them out. p 2"], [282, "108 EENTS EESOLUTE. Upon the dissolution of the order of the Knights of St. Jofui of Jerusalem, in England, and the confiscation of their estates by Henry VIII., certain annual payments called Bents Resolute, due from the lands of religious houses were retained by the Crown, and hence the notice of a \" Rent Resolute,\" or \" Pension,\" of two shillings a year from the Rectory of Cheriton, due to the Queen (Elizabeth), is mentioned in a survey of the Manor of Mill wood, als'* St. John, juxta Swansea taken in 1584. \" From the Rectory of Cheriton, of which the patronage be longs to the said Lady the Queen, yearly ijs.\" These Rents Resolute (Redditus resoluti) were such rents or tenths anciently payable to the Crown from the lands of Abbeys and religious houses ; and after their dissolution, notwithstanding the lands were demised to others, yet these Rents were still re served, and made payable again to the Crown.

They are also mentioned by Leland in his Itinerary and Collectanea, temp. Henry VIII.

SOME ACCOUNT OF THE \"GREAT HOUSE,\" Formerly the Residence of the Cradocks of Cheriton, About sixty years ago there were to be seen not far from Cheriton Bridge extensive remains of what was once a very fine mansion. Little is now left save a portion of an ivy-covered wal with an archway in it. The late Mr. George HoUand, of Cwm Ivy, who died in his 87th year, informed me that he remembered the house well \u2014 that it was large, and had a porch. On a stone"], [295, ""], [296, "STAG FORMERLY OVER THE PORCH OF THE GREAT HOUSE, CHERITON. CHIMNEY .IAMB FROM THE GREAT HOUSE, CHEEITON."], [297, "119 over the outer doorway there were two letters, one of which was a C ; he could not recollect the other. Mr. John Guy, of Cheriton, grocer, since deceased, was able to give a better account of these letters, and remembered the one that Mr. Holland had forgotten, which was an M, and supposed that M C meant \" Made at Cheri ton.\" They were probably the initials of Morgan Cradock, gent., who resided here in 1603, temp. James I. When the house was taken down by the late Henry Lucas, Esq., about thirty years ago, a square stone, having a stag in high relief carved upon it, was removed from the doorway of the porch and conveyed to Stout hall, where it still remains, though in a somewhat mutilated con dition, as shown in the engraving, which was made from a draw ing given me by Mrs. Wood. Mr. Holland described the house as being much out of repair in his time ; but some of the rooms were in good order, and had oak wainscotting and gilt cornices. The latter had been white washed over. It was well supplied with water conveyed through lead pipes. The windows were all fitted with freestone jambs and mullions. A few years ago I found a piece of stone (resembling that of which a quarry is said to exist near Cilivor, in the parish of Llanrhidian), with some carving oil it, placed for the hearth stone of a cottage in the viUage. It had evidently formed part of a chimney piece in the Great House. In an old Parish Terrier, dated 1720, mention is made of Cheriton House Mill. This must have been a smaU water grist mill attached to the Great House ; but the old people have no re collection of it, and the site of it is unknown. The Rev. John AViUiams, M.A., Rector of Cheriton and Pre bendary of Brecon, is said to have lived in the Great House. He died in 1787. His wife, Ann Lucas, daughter of Richard Lucas, Esq., of Peartree, in the parish of Reynoldstone, survived him, and was buried in her husband's grave in the chancel of Cheriton Church. They had three daughters, Elizabeth, Barbara, and Anne. The latter married the celebrated Dr. Spry, Rector of St. Mary-le-bone, London. The others remained single, and after living some years in the Great House, went to reside in Swansea, where they died, and were buried by the side of their parents. The above-mentioned John Williams succeeded his father, the"], [298, "120 Rev. John Williams, who was also incumbent of the parish, and lived at the Glebe House, This John Williams, the son, is reported to have been a great \"conjuror,\" and is said to have laid a ghost which haunted the Glebe House. The story goes that this ghost was the spirit of a lady who once farmed the glebe-land, and used to dispose of the produce of the dairy, such as butter, milk, and cheese, to the in habitants of the place; but not giving just weight, her spirit could not rest, and after death returned to haunt the house, terri fying the inmates with doleful cries of \"Weight and measure, weight and measure,\" many times repeated, while dreadful noises, as of heavy things falling down, aud a quick shrill rattling of all the jugs on the dresser, with a confused rushing to and fro of something thus could not be seen, became at last so unbearable that Mr. Williams was called in to bind the spirit \u2014 and he, as my informant related, \" was an Oxford* scholar, you know.\" In this he fortunately succeeded, but it was as much as he could do, and hard work he had of it, being shut up for two days aud two nights in the blue chamber, the people of the house hearing him cracking his whip aud talking Latin the whole time. It is also said, that he got the mastery only by one word, and that the spirit was bound to make ropes of sand on Llanmadoc burrows, and to remain there \" till she done it.\" I should mention that exorcisms in any other tongue are of no avail. It is perhaps not generally known that evil spirits are particularly afraid of Latin. On a mural tablet over the pew of the Duffryn family, in Cadoxton Church, Neath, we find the name of Mrs. Rose Williams, with the following quaint epitaph in acrostic form : \u2014 In memory of Mrs. Rose Williams, Deceased 24th March, 1680. Roses ye most gay that Flora's wreath beset, Oft while they bud are nipped by frost, but yet She proved a lasting rose full bloom, yet she * This, however, is not strictly correct\u2014 Mr. Williams was a Fellow of King's Col lege, Cambridge."], [299, "121 Exceeded most in good longevity. Whether for want of sap she did when past, Joys of an earthly bliss, the fatal blast Levelled the rest, the rose yet stood, Long uublasted for her neighbour's good. Instead of winter, she enjoys by fate A lasting spring of an eternal date. Most strange, yet she at her Redeemer's day Should sap recover and appear more gay. This lady was the daughter of Morgan Cradock, of Cheriton, and manied Phillip Williams, of Duffryn, Neath, a descendant of Prince Llewellyn. She died, as stated above, on the 24th March, 1680. Immediately over this inscription there used to be, and perhaps is still, a shield, with three boars' heads and a number of cross crosslets cut upon it, surmounted with a boar's head trans fixed with a sword. The three boars' heads were the well-known arms of Sir Matthew Cradock, from whom Mrs. Williams was de scended. There was a Robert Cradock, Rural Dean of Gower in 1400, doubtless a member of the same family ; but the name has become extinct here. There is a gutter in Cheriton parish called \" Scraddock's gutter,\" and a well called \" Scraddock's well.\" These are the only memorials left in this parish of the ancient family of Cradock that lived in the Great House. There is no tombstone in the Church to their memory, and as the old register perished many years ago from neglect and damp, no information could be got from that source. The following papers are of considerable historical value as giving the names of some members of this family who were evi dently residing in Cheriton in 1613 and 1633. They were copied by me from the originals in the possession of the late Colonel Evan Morgan.

Nicholas, F.G.S., in History of Glamorganshire and its Antiquities, a.d. 1874, p. 118, states that the Cradocks of Cheriton settled there about the time of Henry VII., by marriage of David Cradock with the heiress of Philip de la Bere of that place. He is right as to the marriage, but I think he is wrong as to the time, for Elizabeth de la Bere, d. and h. of Philip de la Bere, was granddaughter of Sir Roger de la Bere, Knt., who' flourished in the time of Edward III., consequently these Cradocks must have had a settlement at Cheriton long before Henry VII. The last Cradock who possessed Cheriton was probably Philip' son of Morgan Cradock, who in conjunction with his father signed the bond for \u00a3200, dated 1633, and given at fuU length on an earlier page. Dr. Nicholas, on the authority of an old MS.' entitled J. H.'s MS., states that about the year 1657 Philip Cra dock sold his Cheriton property to Thomas Phillip, of Swansey.

THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PARISH OF CHERITON. Copied from a -written description dated 1 74-7, in the possession of Elisha Walker, of Stembridge, deceased. It is headed thus : \u2014 \" An a Count of the boundaries of the Parish of Cheriton dividing from the adjoining Parishes. \" Beginning at the low water mark on Llandimore sands with strait course from thence to the ditch that divides between Towns end farm and Wibley Castle farm a strait hedge from thence to the roade that leads from Landymore to Llanrhidian crossing the road taking the strait hedge through the Windmill farm to the road that leads from Mansel's sould to Burry river then taking the hedge that borders that road at the North and West sides down to the river, then by the river's side down to a hedge that leads to Rhyers down between Thos.

It is generally believed that there is a very extensive cave in this tor, but the entrance of which having been choked up with the debris of the quarries, its exact situation is now unknown. About eight or nine years ago two quarrymen, David and Richard Thomas, of Cheriton, came across a narrow fissure containing cave earth, and remains of different carnivorous animals. The late Colonel Wood, of Stouthall, employed a man for several days to dig out this fissure, and obtained a great many teeth of the rhinoceros and hyena. Previous to this the quarrymen had thrown out portions of the vertebra, of some large fish or reptile ; one joint, nearly perfect, measured fully seven inches in diameter, and was about three inches thick.

According to a statement made to me by George Evans, labourer, of Llanmadoc, the entrance to this cave is on the north east side of the Tor, and that to the best of his belief it took a westward dii ection. The quarrymen in the progress of their work frequently meet with hollow places in this Tor, generally filled with a peculiar kind of clayey soil, well known to geologists by the name of cave earth, and often containing the teeth of carnivora. Near one of these fissures I found a curious conglomerate of water-worn pebbles, stuck to one another and the face of the rock, and so firmly cemented together that it was a matter of the greatest difficulty to get one out without breaking it. Most of these pebbles were a kind of grey stone, quite different to the limestone in which they were embedded. This cave was a favourite hiding-place of the lightermen of the parishes of Cheriton and Llanmadoc from the press-gang during the French war. A good look-out was kept from the top of Llanmadoc Hill, and as soon as the man-of-war's boat was seen coming from Llanelly, the intelligence was conveyed to the in habitants, and all the young men, whether seafaring or otherwise, retired for safety to this cave, where it is said they amused them selves with various sorts of games to pass away the time until the press-gang went away. My informant (George Evans) told me that during this time a brig called the Weasel, commanded by a Captain Grey, was stationed in the Mumbles Roads for the recep tion of the pressed crews, and that hating got together a comple ment of somewhere about one hundred men, she left, and was lost on a reef of rocks called Baggy Lip, half a mile distant from Baggy Point, which is the entrance to A2_pledore Bay, Devon shire, and all hands perished except one man, who made his escape from the vessel the day before she sailed. In the continuation of the same cliff, but nearer Llandimor village, there is another cave, called \" the Fox-hole.\" It is rather difficult to get at, but is devoid of interest and of small size, without any animal remains. The people say that there is a com munication between this opening and the filled-up cave in the rocky ground above Stembridge Mill. A few yeare ago some men who were quarrying near the Fox- s"], [312, "130 hole, on removing a pieee of rock from the face of the cliff, dis closed a deep cavernous hollow, which has never been thoroughly explored. Looking down into it through the narrow opening, the appearance of the interior is enough to deter the boldest adven turer. Large flat masses of rock, which have evidently dropped from the roof of the cave, may be seen leaning against each other forming a number of rude tunnels and chambers, but apparently so frightfully insecure that few, I think, would care to enter the place. A friend of mine, the Rev. C. E. Gardner, ventured to descend with a rope round him, and crept under some of these overhanging masses ; but it seemed so exceedingly dangerous a proceeding, that I hurried him out before he had time to explore the whole extent of the cave. CAMP ON NOTTLE TOR. This Tor, like many of the other promontories on the Gower coast, is defended on the land side by a deep trench, the preci pitous side of the cliff being a sufficient defence on the other. Fosbroke,* in his remarks on Danish camps, says : \u2014 \" Promon tories were favourite positions of this people ; and in these they appear only to have thrown a vallum with one entrance across the isthmus, for such is the Danwerc.\" SOME ACCOUNT OF THE EXTINCT CHURCH AT LLANDIMOR. Though now reckoned among the extinct churches of Gower, the fact of the annual Mapsant (i.e., the memory of the saint), kept on the 4th of February, is of itself a sufficient proof that a church once existed in or near the village of Llandimor. The existence of a mapsant invariably implies the existence of a church. In this case the church indeed has disappeared, but the mapsant is kept on still. But fortunately we are not left to depend upon the evidence of the mapsant, for in an ancient document called \" The Confirmation of Bishop Anselm,\" dated a.d. 1230, it ap pears that there was a church at Llandimor at that time. Not a trace of it is now to be found, and, strange to say, there is not Vid. \"Encyclop\u00e6dia of Antiquities,\" by the Rev. T. Dudley Fosbroke, F.S.A., 1825, p. 605."], [313, "131 even a tradition among the people of the existence of any such building. The following extract from the old Terrier of Cheriton parish, relating to glebe land at Llandimor, has probably some re ference to the church that once certainly existed there : \u2014 \" Item : An acre and a half of salt meadow in Landymore, in two distinct fields, allowed in lieu of tithe hay for fifteen acres of meadow situated near ye same place.\" It is said that these two fields were the gift of some great lady in former times. But we must return to the Confirmation of Bishop Anselm. From this document we learn that the church of Llandimor, together with those of Llan rhidian, Walterston, and Rhossili, were given by William de Tur bervUle to the knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who had what is called a Commandery, at Slebech, in Pembrokeshire. The passage relating to the donation is as follows : \u2014 \" Ex dono WiU de Turberville eecliam de Lanrhidian cum capella sua Vill\u00e6 de Walter, et eecliam de Llandunnor, et eecliam de Rossily.\" That is, William de Turberville gave the church of Llan rhidian, with his chapel of Walterston, and the church of Llan dunnor (evidently Llandimor), and the church of Rhossili. The name itself (Llandimor) clearly points to the existence of a church. The word Llan is Welsh, and means literally an en closure. In course of time it came to imply a church. Hence the old Welsh phrase \" Myned ir Llan\" \u2014 to go to church. In uearly every instance (certainly in Gower) wherever the prefix Llan occurs in the name of a place, it ha3 reference to the church of that place. Llandunnor (sic) in the copy of the Confirmation of Bishop Anselm, given by Fenton in his Appendix to the His tory of Pembrokeshire, is perhaps a typographical blunder, or it may be the mistake of a copyist in transcribing the original MS. The errors of transcribers have often caused much difficulty in identifying the places to which they refer. Llandimor is a purely Welsh word, and means the Church of the Sea ; and it is very likely the encroachment of the sea was the cause why the church was ultimately abandoned. I am the more inclined to think the above is the true etymology of the name, inasmuch as at least one old Latin author in his list of churches given to the Knights of St. John, write.i Llandimor \" Llandenmare,\" a kind B 2"], [314, "132 of Welsh Latin barbarism, meaning, however, very plainly the Church by the Sea. Llandimor church, therefore, unlike the majority of Gower churches, takes its name from the locality and not from the saint to whom it was dedicated. Rees, in his \" Catalogue of the Welsh Saints,\" speaks of Llandymor as an extinct church in Gower. It is, however, quite clear from the notice made of it in the Confirmation of Bishop Anselm, that there was a Church here in 1230 (the date of that document); and that it was available for the purposes of worship at the close ofthe 13th century is equally certain, as will presently be seen from the mention made of it in the Taxatio Ecclesiastica of Pope Nicholas, IV., A.D., 1291, where it is described as Llandymor Church, \"Ecclia de Landymor,\" and valued at \u00a35 a year. Decanatus de Goery, Ecclia de Landymor \u00a35. How long after this latter date it might have continued I have no means of knowing. It is not mentioned in the Valor Eccle siasticus of Henry VIII., cir., 1536, though Cheriton is there spoken of ; and as the date of the completion of the Valor cor\" responds to the time when the sea was making great encroach ments on this coast, it is not unlikely that Llandymor Church was abandoned about that time, hence perhaps the omission of its name in the list of Gower Churches which we find in that Survey. Besides the damage done by the sea in Henry VIII., and Queen Mary's time, there was another very serious invasion said to have happened in 1607, temp. James I., and is recorded in the Harlein Mis. as follows : \u2014 \" Upon Tuesday the twentieth of January last past 1607 in divers places, there happened such an overflowing of waters, such a violent swelling of the sea, &c., that is to say in the Counties of Gloucester, Summerset, together with the Counties of Monmouth, Glamorgan, Carmarthen, and divers other places of South Wales ; the like never in the memory of man hath ever been seene or heard of, &c, &c. This remarkable occurrence took place about nine o'clock in the morning, when people might see and perceive a far of, as it were in the element, huge and mighty Hills of water tumbling one over another, in such sort a3 if the greatest mountains in the world had overwhelmed the lowe Valleys, &c. Swansea,"], [315, "133 Laugharne, Llanstephan, aud divers other places of Glamorgan shire, are said to have suffered seriously. Houses, ricks of corn, sheep, cattle, and human beings in great numbers were overtaken and swept away. And that which is most strange, there are Dot now founde only floating upon the waters still remayning, the dead carka.es of many men, women, and children, but also an abundance of all kinds of wild beasts, as foxes, hares, conies, rats, moules, and such like, some of them swimming one upon anothers backe, think ing to have saved themselves thereby, but all was in vaine snch was the Force of the Waters that overpressed them.\" From a pamphlet entitled, \"God's warning to the people of England by the great Overflowing of the waters and Floudes lately hapned in South Wales and many other places, &c., print. d at London, for W.

The history of this old castle (sometimes called Bovehill Castle) and its demesnes, first comes before us as the possession of Llewellyn ap lorwerth, Prince of North Wales, a.d. 1195 \u2014 1240, who, as will be seen by the subjoined charter, bestowed it upon a chieftain of his named Morgan Gam ; but as the deed is undated we have no means of knowing the exact year when the grant was made : \u2014 Writ and Plea of Lands in Llandimor and Eilvey.

Morever, I have given and granted to him all the land at the east bank of the Tawy, as the said water falls into the sea.

These being witnesses :\u2014 Madox, son of Griffith Maylor ; Meredith, son of Robert ; Ednyved Vaughan ; Eynion, son of Walhiney ; Madoc, son of Richard ; Mailgun, son of Rees Crek ; Rees, son of Griffith ; and many others. J. 2.- \u2014 To our Lord the Ring and his council, pray the tenants our Lord the Prince of Llandimor and Kulveye in Wales, that whereas, Llewellyn, formerly Prince of Wales, gave the aforesaid lands and tenements to Morgan Gam, and to his heirs for his ser vice, to hold of him and his heirs, Princes of Wales, for ever, by the service of a Knight's fee, which lands and tenements were held of the said Prince well and peaceably, and were attendant to him as of his principality within his Lord-hip of Caermarthen, up to the time that Sir John de Brewes, then Lord Gower, assumed by duress and force the said attendance to himself, in decrease of the Princi pality, as is found by inquisition of good and substantial people of the said Lordship of Caermarthen, returned unto the Chancery of our Lord the Prince, that is now in London. Whereupon our Lord the Prince, perceiving his right so alienated, commanded his ministers of Caermarthen to distrain in the said lands and tene ments, in order to have the attendance, whereby the tenants of the lands and the tenements aforesaid made their attendance on our said Lord .the Prince. And thereupon the Earl of Warwick entreated our said Lord the Prince, who has the said Principality, to draw the attendance of the said tenants to his Lordship of Gower, which will be greatly in decrease of the said Principality, which our said Lord the Prince has of your gift to hold in tail to him and his heirs, Kings of England, to whom the reversion of the said Principality is expectant. Wherefore may it please your Highness to command your council to bring the business to such end that the state of the Crown be saved without blemish, and"], [318, "136 that the tenants abovesaid be not alienated from their liege Lord to the undoing of their estate. [Endorsed] Forasmuch as this petition touches our Lord the Kins: and his Crown and the Prince, let the same petition be sent before the King and his great Council. Though these two documents are undated, I think it is tolerably clear that the one marked J. 1 is the early part of the 13th century, temp. Llewellyn ap lorwerth, while that marked J. 2 is the latter part of the same century, temp. Llewellyn ap Griffyd, and the expressions in this document \" formerly Prince of Wales,\" and \"is expectant,\"* seem to.confirm this; for the former Prince plainly points to LleweUyn ap lorwerth, then dead, while the complaints of the aggrieved inhabitants of Llandimor to another Prince then living, and at the time apparently in London, taken in connection with the expression \" is expectant,\" makes it clear enough that Llewellyn ap Griffyd, the last Prince of Wales, is here intended. He flourished in the latter half of the 13th century, and was alive in 1281. He had to do homage for his lauds to Edward I., and for this purpose had to go to London every Christmas. Coming to the capital for this purpose in 1277, the citizens made such fun of the Welshmen that they determined , to rebel, and in 1281 LleweUyn headed them. This was the last expiring effort of the Welsh for liberty and independence. It failed, and secured to Edward I. the undisputed sovereignty of Wales. How Llewellyn ap lorwerth, after the conquest of Gower by Henry de Newburgh, managed to get possession of the extensive manor of Llandimor, I am unable to say. Those were wild times, however; and the motto \" hodie mihi eras tibi,\" might have been truly written over the gates of many a stronger castle than that which now looks down on the lowly village of Llandi mor. It is well known that Llewellyn beat the Normans in several pitched battles, and took many castles and much land from them, and so far made them afraid of him as to induce several * Alluding to the Reversion of the Kingdom to the English Crown."], [319, "137 of them to seek his friendship ; and in or about the year 1215 he married one of his daughters to Reginald de Braose, Lord of Gower, and in the year 1219 another daughter, Margaret, married John de Braose, who also became Lord of Gower. Among the witnesses to the deed J. 1, are the names of some men of the greatest note in Wales at that time. - Ednyved Vychan was Chief Counsellor to LleweUyn ; Rhys-Cryg (i.e., Rhys the Hoarse), was the son of Rhys ap Griffith, and was buried in St. David's Cathedral. The next possessor of the Castle and Manor of Llandimor was Sir Gilbert de Turberville, of Coity Castle, Glamorganshire, who married Maud (alias Matilda) the daughter of the above mentioned Morgan Gam. The following extract alluding to the marriage and passing of the property is taken from a old MS. called \" The Book of Glamorganshire's Antiquities,\" written by Rice Merrick, cir. a.Dj 1578, temp. Queen Elizabeth, and pub lished by Sir T. Phillips, Bart., in 1825. The information is contained under the pedigree of Sir Pagan de Turberville, of Coity Castle : \u2014 \" Sir Pagan Turbervil had 3 sons, Symon, Gylbert, and Myryk. His wife's name was Sibilla. \"Symon the eldest succeeded his father, but died without issue. Gylbert his brother succeeded him ; his wife's name was Agnes. \" Payn his son succeeded him, who married Maud, d. and sole heir to Morghan Gham, sonne to Morgan vap Cradog, vap Jestyn.\" But after this our old author adds the following note : \u2014 \" I find,\" he says, \" in the register of Neath that Gilbert mar ried with her ;\" and then he gives what we may conclude to be the extract from the Register of Neath relating to the matter. \"Gylbert his son succeeded his father, who married with Maud the daughter of Morgan Gam. To whom Gam with the consent of Matilda his wife gave in ffranke* marriage with Maud * Vol. 1. Stephens Comm. 253 (h). In the particular case where an estate is given to a man on his marriage with the daughter or cousin of the donor in frank-marriage such donees are tenants in special tail. Blackstone tells us (vol. 2. p. 115) that in the ca6e of T"], [320, "138 their eldest daughter, Landymor, Rhossily the greater and the lesse, as the same deed registered in the book of Neth Testefyeth.\" This last statement is correct, and is confirmed by the follow ing charter made by Sir Gilbert de Turberville, great grandson ot the above named Sir Gilbert, in which he mentions the fact of his great grandfather (proavus), having married the daughter of the aforesaid Morgan Gam, and how his ancestor in that degree was disseised of his manor of Llandimor by Sir Wm. de Braosa, Lord ol Gower.

To all the faithful in Christ to whom the present writing shall come, Gilbert de Turberville, Lord of Landymor, son and heir of Sir Payne de Turberville, greeting in the Lord for ever. Whereas Sir William de Brewose, son and heir of Sir John de Brewose, formerly disseised Sir Gilbert de Turberville, my great grandfather of the manor of Landymore with its appurtenances in the Lord. ship of Gower, who held it in fee tail conjointly with Matilda, his wife, and of which manor indeed the fee and right pertains to me as their heir. And afterwards the aforesaid Sir William de Brewose, son and heir of Sir John de Brewose and Sh- WiUiam t 2"], [322, "140 de Brewose, Lord of Gower, son of the same Sir William and Sir William de Brewose, son of the same Sir William, Lord of Gower, had enfeoffed* Sir Bobert de Penres, Knt., his heirs and assigns, and other tenants of whom the said Sir Robert purchased, of certain lands and tenements within that manor to my disherison, to be held under a certain form. Know all of you that I willing to make a special favour in his behalf to the said Sir Robert, hia heirs, and assigns, and altogether for me and my heirs to quit, claim for ever, have granted to the same Sir Robert for me and my heirs, that he Sir Robert and his heirs for ever, should have and hold all the aforesaid lands and tenements with the appurten ances, which he held of the gift and grant of the said Sir William de Brewosa, son and heir of Sir John de Brewosa, and Sir William de Brewosa, Lord of Gower, son of the same Sir William, and Sir WiUiam de Brewosa, son of the same Sir William, Lord of Gower, and of other tenants of whom the said Sir Robert purchased, of me and my heirs, by the services and customs which he from .hats time did to the same Sir WiUiam, Lord of Gower and by suit to my court there from three weeks to three weeks,f and by foreign service which pertain to those tenements. Save only to me and my heirs, cognizance of aU pleas appertaining to my court of Landymore, of aU tenants and resiants within my fee of Landymore ; being unwilling that the same Sir Robert, his heirs, or assigns should be troubled by any other title through me, my heirs, or assigns or in any way vexed or aggrieved.

M. Lloyd, of Lincoln's Inn, thinks that \"inde\" refers to the time of his enfeoffment by Sir William de Brewosa ; it may perhaps be rendered there out, i.e., out of the land, but he inclines to the former view. I That is every three weeks. This alludes to the Courts Baron, to which all the freeholders owing suit and service to the Lord had to attend to assist him in dispensing justice ; such courts were anciently held every three weeks."], [323, "141 From this old charter so full of valuable historical matter, we learn among other things how the estate of Llandimor passed from the family of de Turberville to that of de Penrice (here called Penres) how Sir Robert de Penrice. became possessor of the land while Sir Gilbert de Turberville retained only his right of Lord of the manor. It is a curious circumstance how he should have so wiUingly parted with this property, when as he says, he was the rightful owner. He gives it up, however, of his own free will and accord, the expression is, by an act of special favour. There must have been some more substantial reason than this, but not stated in the deed. There might have been something in the nature of the disseisment by Sir William de Braose in his great grandfather's time, which might have made it difficult for the great grandson, Sir Gilbert, to recover possession of the property ; and perhaps to avoid a costly litigation, the event being uncertain on both sides, and wishing probably to keep up a friendly feeling between two such powerful families, he cedes his right to the lands \"per specialem gratiam,\" retaining only to himself the manorial rights. In the following charter we have an account of one of those tenements of land within the manor of Llandimor, with which (as Sir Gilbert says), Sir William de Braosa had enfeoffed certain persons, to his (Sir Gilbert's)_disherison.

The labour of collecting the materials that I got together has been very great, and I should be very glad indeed if any one could add to them and arrange the matter better than I have done. It will be observed from the charter of Sir Gilbert de Turber ville given above, and dated 1335, that Sir Gilbert was then the Lord of the manor of Landymor, and doubtless continued so until his death, when that event took place I have been unable to hear; his wife was the Lady Cecily de St. Maur. Before the close of the fourteenth century, however, the manor of Landymor came by some means into the hands of Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk of that name, who died in 1399, possessed of the manor of Landymor and other manors and estates in Gower, a third part of which was assigned by writ of the King (Henry IV.) by way of a dower to his widow, the Duchess Elizabeth, the custody of the whole to remain in the hands of the king, until the majority of Thomas, son and heir of the late Duke ; all of which will be fully set forth in the following downment, which is of great interest and value, not only an account of the information it contains respecting the manor of Landimor, but also from a quantity of other matter bearing upon persons and places of note in Gower in former times.

[This is followed by] Extent of the Lordship of Gower, made by the Escheator of the Lord the King, and abridged for the dotation of the Lady Duchess of Norfolk. [The items on the Roll brought into a Tabular form.] Among the many transcripts of ancient documents obtained from the Record Office in London, there are none which are more full of varied information relating to Gower in general, and the Manor of Llandimor in particular, than the foregoing, entitled Ministers' Accounts 2\"- 23 Rich. II. \u2014 1 Henry IV.; that is from a.d. 1399 to a.d. 1400. These accounts supply us with a great deal of interesting matter concerning this manor in connection with Thomas Duke of Norfolk and Elizabeth his wife. This was Thomas de Mowbray, First Duke of Norfolk of that name, and a descendant of Sir John de Mowbray, who married Alina de Braose, one of the daughters and coheiresses of Wm. de Braose, last Lord of Gower of that name. Upon the Duke's death in 1399,* his widow, the Duchess Elizabeth, had granted to her as a dower the third part of the Manor of Llandimor, as weU as of other manors and possessions of the late Duke her husband. Thomas, Lord de Mowbray, son and heir of the said Duke, who should have suc ceeded his father, was convicted of high treason, and executed at York, before he came of age. From the foregoing papers we learn, that during his minority the Lordship of Gower came into the hands of the King (Henry IV.), who deputed Sir Hugh Waterton, Knt., to take the custody of it, returning an account thereof through divers bailiffs and ministers to Robert Egerley and John Mathew, the King's auditors, for the time being. Then foUows a statement of the various sums of money coUected in the form of escheats, avowries (distraints for rents) rents, &c., payable to the Duchess as her dower. At this time Sir WiUiam Stradling, Knt., was Steward of Gower, a post of high honour ; and was * Vide East Anglian, Historical Account of the families of Albini and JMowbray, by S.Tymms, Esq., F.S.A. 1861.

After this foUows some valuable information respecting the Lordship of Gower; for in these Letters Patent we learn that at one time, temp. Rich. II. , the said Lord ship was in the hands of Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. From him it passed in the year 1397 to Thomas Earl of Notting ham, afterwards the Dnke of Norfolk, abovesaid. Leland gives us the following brief account of the time and cause of the transfers: \u2014 \" 1397: Thomas Comes Nottingham per biUam erroris quam tulit, contra Thomam Comitem Warwic : recuperavit terras de Gower.\" The next Lord of Gower, and owner of the Manor of Llandi mor was John, brother and heir of the above-mentioned unhappy Thomas, and who in due time succeeded to the title and estates of Duke of Norfolk, 2nd Duke of the de Mowbray name. He died a.d. 1432, and his inquisitio post mortem was taken in that year, being the 11th Henry VI. The foUowing hst of manors and estates in Gower are returned as being in his possession at his death : \u2014 Landymore maner9 extent9 Lynon maner9 extent?

The above-mentioned John, Second Duke, was succeeded by his son and heir, John, Third Duke of Norfolk. The accession of this Duke to the title and estates of his late father, cir. 1435, 14th Henry VI., brings us to a very interesting point in the his tory of the old castle and manor of Llandimor, which were given by this Duke to Sir Hugh Johnnys, Knt., Deputy Knight Marshal of England. The exact year when the grant was made is un known ; the inscription on the well-known brass of Sir Hugh and his lady in St. Mary's Church, Swansea, only records the fact that the \" Good Joh'n, Duke of Norfolk, gyave vnto hym the mano' of Landymo', to hym & to his heyr' for eu'more.\" But, notwith standing the very positive record of this gift, as mentioned on the brass, it seems that the same Duke must have withdrawn the gift again, for in his inquisitio post mortem, dated 1st Edward IV., 1461 (he died 6th November in that year), Llandimor is returned in the list of his landed estates in Gower as in his possession at his death : \u2014 Swansey castr' et maner' Gower dominium Kilvey dominium Penris Oystermouth terr' ibm *Lagwith Landymore maner Webley tPenwindon Raynoldestone \\ Langerne Necleston \u00a7Ulpeden Very little now remains of this old castle, once the seat of many successive lords of the manor of Llandimor.

The account of Sir Hugh,\"'' his pedigree, arms, and several particulars of his life, have been so weU and carefully written by the Rev. Thomas Bliss and G. Grant Francis, Esq., F.S.A., that any remarks of mine would be superfluous. Sir Hugh, according to the inscription on his tomb, was a Crusader, and received the honour of knighthood at the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the 14th of August, 1441, After re- maining five years in foreign lands, fighting against the enemies of the Christian faith, he was made Knight Marshal of France, and shortly after that was advanced to the dignity of Knight Marshal of England, by John, Duke of Norfolk, Hereditary Earl Marshal. In the enjoyment of this honourable office, and resting after the toils of war in the quiet security of his castle, given him by the above Duke, we may suppose this worthy and valorous knight died in peace. The date of his death is not recorded on his tomb, and is unknown. He flourished during the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward IV, and was certainly alive in a.d. 1463s, when he purchased of one Richard Cause a certain burgage with its appurtenances, in Fisher-street, Swansea. I have a rubbing of the brass taken in 1862. It is remarkable as being the most interesting and almost the only ancient specimen of this kind of sepulchral monument in South Wales. The re presentation of the Resurrection of our Lord at the head is very rare and unusual : only one similar example is at present known, which is in All HaUows Church, Barking, London.

The foundations of the old castle, with portions of the waUs, may be traced over a large space of ground, and extend to a bold rock on the north called the tumpit. About forty years ago great quantities of pins used to be picked up on one jjarticular spot within the precincts of the castle. Daniel Hullin, of Cheriton, an old man, since deceased, told me that when he was a boy, living at Llandimor, it was a common practice of the children there to go and amuse themselves by col lecting pins in this castle : they were very much like those now in use. Sir Hugh Johns is said to have repaired and enlarged the castle (built long before his time), and to have supplied it with water conveyed through lead pipes from a well on the north side of Rhiers down ; and as a proof of the truth of this latter cir cumstance portions of lead piping were discovered in a field at Bovehill, which has ever since received the appropriate name of the \" Leaden Hay.\" As a further confirmation, it should be men tioned that the well from which the water is said to have been got is called Pipe Well. There is still to be seen a distinct furrow like indentation conducting from this well, and traceable for * Flat misericordia tua domine niper nos."], [358, "174 several yards down the hill. A piece of very thick lead, roUed and beaten together, about six inches long, was found by me in 1874, among some of the debris of the old castle, at the foot of the hill on which it stands. From a survey of the Lordship of Gower, made by order of Oliver Cromwell in 1650, we learn that the service by which the manor of Llandimor was held of the Lord Paramount was that of one knight, a pair of gilt spurs, or twenty shiUings yearly. I should mention that a place is pointed out within the pre cincts of the castle called the \"Lion's Den.\" In this particular place (formerly one of the rooms of the castle), and in the side of a portion of a wall still standing, there is a kind of cove, neatly plastered with some kind of excessively hard plaster. The bottom is filled up with rubbish, so that I cannot say how deep down it may go. As much of it as can be seen resembles the half round niches in which statues are often fixed. John, son and heir of John, third Duke of Norfolk, succeeded to the title and estates as fourth and last Duke of the Mowbray name, cir. 1464. The engraving of his seal is from a drawing by Mrs. Traherne, of Coedriglan. It was in this Duke's time that the manor of Llandimore again changed hands, and, in a.d. 1470 came into the possession of WiUiam, Earl of Pembroke. From a Patent RoU of the 9th Edward IV., we learn that the said Earl recovered against John, Duke of Norfolk, amongst other castles and manors in Wales, the castle and manor of Oystermouth, the castle and manor of Lloughor, and the manors of Landymour, Russilly Kythul, Trewydna, Lynien, Pennard, and West Gower. The roll is printed at full length in Part I. of my History of West Gower, p. 80. After this there is a blank in the account of the manor of Llandimor until we come to the reign of Henry VII., when it was held by Sir Rhys ap Thomas ; and his son, Sir Griffith Rhys, and grandson, Rhys Griffith, successively held it, until the latter being convicted of high treason, temp.

The charge against him was for conspiring with certain others to depose Henry VIII. , and to put the crown of England on the head of James V., King of Scotland. It is also stated in the indictment that he was greatly encouraged in this attempt by an old Welsh prophecy, which foretold that England should be conquered by a raven and a man with a red hand. It was said that James V. had one of his hands red up to the wrist, and as Rhys Griffith (descended from Urien Rheged) bore for his crest a raven, it was thought that this ancient prophecy would have been fulfiUed in the persons of these two men. From the foregoing document we learn that in the 23rd year of the reign of Henry VIII , and soon after the attainder of Rhys Griffith, Esq., this manor of Llandimor was bestowed as a jointure upon Lady Katherine Edgecombe. She probably held it until her death, which probably took place in the year 1547, the 38th of Henry VIII. , for in that year the King granted a lease of it for 21 years to Sir Wilham Herbert, Knt., as will be seen presently from a Patent Roll of the 2nd of Queen Elizabeth. But before we come to that, the foUowing very interesting document is to be noted, relating to the purchase of this manor in the years 1557-8, by Anthony Mansel, Esq., of Llantrithid Park, Glamorganshire. This was the same Anthony Mansel who a very few years after, in 2nd Queen Elizabeth, purchased nearly the whole of the land in the parish of Llanmadoc, including probably the manor, which was certainly in his tenure in the year 1583 ; for in a survey of the said manor made in that year, it is returned as being in hia possession.

I have a drawing of his portrait, on which was inscribed 'Ant Mansel \u00e6t. sue 72, 1602,' and the arms of Mansel and Basset. His granddaughter, Miss Aubrey, is with him. Mr. Traherne has written 'Anthony Mansel, born 1536, buried at Llantrithyd, 30 Nov., 1604. Eliz., his wife, 26 Dec., 1607.' This painting, which I copied in 1836, was on panel, and is now destroyed. The background represented a tilt-yard, and had become very indistinct when the drawing was made.\" bb 2"], [366, "180 Patent Roll, 2 Elizabeth, Part 10, Mem. 4- Grant to William, Earl of Pembroke. tXtQ\\X\\H Omnibus ad quos zc. salutem cum precharissimus pater noster Henricus octavus nuper Rex Anglie per literas suas patentes sub magno sigillo suo Anglie confect gereii dat apud Westfh sexto die Septembris Anno Regni sui tricesimo octavo concesserit tradiderit et ad firman dimiserit Dilecto svienti suo Willo nunc Comiti Pembrok per nomen Willelmi Herberte Militis unius private Camere sue.

Having thus far given some account of the Manor of Llan dimor and its owners from the time of Llewellyn ap Jorwerth to the close of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, i.e., from the 13th to the beginning of the 17th century, a period of nearly 400 years, I now pass on to the survey of this manor, its extent and boun daries, taken in the 40th and 44th years of the reign of that Queen, for William, Earl of Pembroke ; but before doing so it is necessary to advert to the contents of those documents relating to the purchase of thi& manor in the reigns of Queens Mary and Elizabeth, as without a few words of explanation they must strike the reader as rather perplexing. In the 5th and 6th of Phillip and Mary, this manor\u2014 formerly part of the confiscated estates of Rhys Griffith, Esq.\u2014 was pur chased of the Crown by Anthony Mansell, Esq., and has- remained in that family ever since, being now in the possession of one of its descendants\u2014 C. R. Mansel Talbot, Esq., M.P. The purchase by William Earl of Pembroke so soon after the purchase by the aforesaid Anthony ManseU, namely in the 2nd cc 2"], [374, "188 year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, only about two years aster the purchase by Anthony Mansell, and the purchase money in the Earl's case being likewise handed over to the Crown, and no mention being made of Anthony Mansell, who was then in pos session of the manor, is very puzzling, and naturally suggests tlie question, what Was it that the Earl of Pembroke bought ? The explanation probably is, that the Earl of Pembroke purchased certain feudal rights over this, and other Gower manors, to be held of the Crown \"in capite\"; an ancient tenure, the nature of which is fully explained in Madox's Baronia. In the 41st of Queen Elizabeth, i.e. in 1 599, William Herbert, Esq., obtained from the Crown a \"license of alienation,\" to alienate his Lordship and Manor of Llandimore, Rhosili, and Llanrhidian to Lawrence Hide, Esq. and others, vide Patent Roll already quoted. As I have not been able to find what relationship William Herbert, Esq., stood in to WiUiam Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, I am unable to say how he came to obtain this power to alienate the Earl's rights over this manor to others. I should mention that ah the foregoing documents are tran scripts from the originals preserved in the Record Office, London. Llandimor Mannor. \" The Survey of the Mannor aforesaid.

This family was of good standing in Gower in the seventeenth century, and intermarried with the Aubreys of Yniscedwyn, and the Lewis's and Lucas's of Llandimor ; the Rev. Richard Portrey, and Christopher, his son and heir, are described as residing at this latter place in 1683. The sources of our information with regard to the above statement, are certain tombstones in. Cheriton and ' Llangennith Churches, and a most interesting document lately published by Col. Geo. Grant Francis, F.SA.., of Swansea, in 1874, which appeared in The Cambrian Newspaper of that year. The following is a copy of an inscription on a tombstone formerly fixed against tha wall of the Choir in Cheriton Church : \u2014"], [379, "193 Here Lyeth the Body of Elizabeth Lewis wife of Richard Portrey, Clerk who Departed this life ya 12 day of April 1700 Aged 75 I here to dust soon turned shall be Mind readers you must follow me. Also Here lyeth the Body of Mr. Jenkin Lucas second Son of Henry Lucas of Stouthall Esquire Who departed this life August The 25 1744 Aged 39 years. Comparing this inscription with those on the tombstones in Llangennith Church, \u2014 and which will be given at fuU length in my notices of that parish, \u2014 it appears that the Rev. Richard Portrey married twice; his first wife being Catherine, daughter of Morgan Aubrey, Esq., of Yniscedwyn; she died a.d. 1674, aged 29, and was the mother of eight children, of whom only one son, Christopher, and two daughters, Mayzod and Catherine, survived her. It is also stated that she had been married eleven years, which would place the date of her marriage in 1663. As there can be littie doubt that Mr. Richard Portrey, \"Clerke,\" on the Cheriton tombstone, is the same person described as the Rev. Richard Portrey, A.M., on that in Llangennith Church, it seems equally clear that Elizabeth Lewis, who died in 1700 was his second wife, whom he also survived, as he died, according to the date on the latter tombstone, in 1714. This Mr. Portrey was a great pluralist, being at the same time Rector of the Parishes of Rhosili and Ystradgynlais, and Vicar of Llangennith; as he doubtless possessed private property in Llandimor, and was heir at law, as we shaU presently see, to Morgan Aubrey, Esq., of Yniscedwyn, he must have been a very wealthy person ; and this brings us to the very interesting paper published by Col. Francis, in which the said Rev.

As most of the matter contained in the statement of Mr- Mathew Towers, plaintiff, is quite irrelevant to the present inquiry, it wiU suffice to quote just as much of it as assists us in the history of the Portreys of Llandimor.

With regard to the references made to these mills, it is particularly to be noted that they are all described as situated in Llandimor, not Cheriton ; it is a curious fact that Cheriton is not once named, though these old corn mills (still in existence) are in Cheriton parish, and are without doubt the very mdls there mentioned, as they are known at the present day by the names given in this old document. The fuUing mill* no longer exists, but there is a flannel factory situated on the boundaries of the two parishes of Cheriton and Llanmadoc, but it is of recent date, and stands (so the old people say) on the site of an old water grist miU. Mention is made of a fishing weir in Llandimor, belonging to John de la Bere, which had been wholly laid waste by the sea, The allusion to the destruction of this weir is of some importance, as it may possibly point to an encroachment of the sea about that time. The expressions, \"Let to the gaval,\" and \"Within the gaval,\" are unusual in ancient deeds, but are frequently met with in those relating to the County of Pembroke. There is a very interesting article on the meaning of the word Gabellum in the Cambrian Register vol. ii, p. 190; from which we learn that it signifies the state of a tenant holding lands at will, or for a term of years, or for life, and not a freeholder. Thus for instance where in the foregoing accounts we find the sentence, \"David ap Thomas p vna pcell infra gavilt voc goseplottes xiiijd,\" it means, that David ap Thomas was a tenant paying 14d. a-year for the goose plots, that is, that he was not a freeholder. So also in another place in the same accounts we have, \"ij acr tr apud Grostowe dimiss leva ap lor ad gavillarn;\" the meaning is, that two acres of land at Grostowe are let to Ivan ap Ivor, as tenant at will. The writer in the Cambrian Register says, \" You shall find in divers ancient deeds this word Gabellum, or in Gabello, and some times Gabulario ; in the case before us, the word is gavilla. In many ancient rent-roUs and surveys we meet with the expressions, '\u25a0 Redditus liberorum tenent ;\" and \" Redditus gabulariorum \u2022 A Mill for thickening cloth, what is called at the present day a Tucking Mill. DD 2"], [382, "196 tenent;\" the former refers to what is called chief rent, payed by free holders; the latter to the rent payed by tenants at will; and these rents were called by the common people Gael rents, and the tenants Gael tenants. In short Gael tenants was a term appli cable to aU manner of tenants who had not an estate of in heritance. In this most interesting old document notice is made of reliefs; for example, Mr. Richard Maun eel pays his \" Reasonable relief,\" on coming of age, and on receiving seizin of his lands. To understand this it must be observed, that when any of the King's tenants in chief (in capite) died, the King as guardian of his heir seized his lands, and kept them in his custody tiU the heir came of age; when he was 21 he had to do homage to the king, and pay a certain sum of money, which latter was caUed his relief, and he then had seizin, alias livery of his lands. The profits received by the King in the meantime were caUed \" Primer seizin.\" The relief of an earl as set down in the laws of the Conqueror was eight horses, saddled and bridled, four helmets, four coats of mail, four shields, four spears, four swords, four chasers, and one palfrey, saddled and bridled. That of a baron, half as mnch, with the palfrey. That of a vavasor to his Lord, his best horse, his helmet, coat of mail, shield, spear, sword, or in lieu of them, a hundred shillings. That of the countryman, his best beast. And of him that farmed his lands, a year's rent. There was a difference between what was called \" the ancient relief,\" (antiquum relevium) and \"the reasonable relief,\" (ration abile relevium) . The former is met with in one of the clauses of the great Charter of King John : the heir of an earl, \u00a3100 ; of a baron 100 marks; of a knight, 100 shillings. Vide Rapin's History of England, vol. i, p. 285, and TindaU's note on the same. The Brandy House. The name given to a cottage that stands on the edge of the marsh at Llandimor, and was built about 100 years ago for smug gling purposes. The floor was excavated to a considerable depth and then arched over, forming a capacious cellar. As far as I have been able to learn it was never used more than once as a smuggling place, and was then filled with tobacco and silk. It"], [383, "197 was afterwards converted into a dwelling-house. There is, how ever, a very curious story told in connection with the building of this house. When the masons were erecting the walls, they happened to take a certain stone upon which a fisherman named Wm. Flewid was in the habit of resting his basket on his return from the sands. Perceiving the men meddling with this stone, he cautioned. them not to take it, otherwise no good would come of it ; they however paid no attention to the old man's request, and built it into the wall as a quoin stone. When they returned to their work the next morning, they found to their astonishment that all the walling done the day before had fallen down ; the work was again repaired, but with the same result as before, and every morning they discovered that the labour of the preceding day was thrown away. How long this unsatisfactory state of things con tinued my informant could not say ; it ended however by the masons restoring the fisherman's stone to its former situation, and the building was soon finished. This story is very amusingly told by Mr. C. D. Morgan, in his \"Wanderings in Gower,\" to whom I communicated it. The Tan Pit. Adjoining the Brandy House there is a large shallow pool, but quite dry in the summer, called the \"Tan Pit.\" There is no tra dition in the place that it was ever used for tanning purposes, or that such a trade was ever carried on in the neighbourhood. As it is quite certain that the Danes once over-ran the Peninsula of Gower, the name of this place may have some reference to those fierce warriors, some of whom after a battle with the inhabitants, might have been buried here ; so that the name of the place is perhaps more correctly \" The Dane Pit,\" corrupted into Tan Pit. On Nottle Tor, a short distance from this place, remains of an ancient Danish camp are still to be seen, and this fact tends to confirm my theory as to the true etymology of the place now called the \"Tan Pit.\" The Bowling Green. The name given to a small piece of meadow land belonging to the glebe, not far from the Churchyard wall on the west, and ad-"], [384, "198 joining the Burry River. Here, no doubt, the youths of the parish met in former times to play the game of bowls ; the ground having evidently been levelled for that purpose ; there is a kind of groove still plainly traceable in the centre of the ground, and about 21 yards long, evidently made by the continual truckling of the bowls. The East Window of Cheriton Church. It is to be noted as a peculiarity about this window, that the three carved heads showm in the woodcut, do not form any part of the stone frame work of the window, but are simply stuck in the wall above it, there being projections left at the back of the heads for this purpose. I should mention that the Vestry at the North side of this Church is an addition built in 1874. A blocked-up doorway was found in the north wall of the chancel, evidently made for ad mission to the Church on that side. Close to this doorway (which has again been utilized) and about a yard or so to the east of it, there is a square blocked-up aperture, low down in the wall, but which I have never explored. This has most likely a con nection with a deep hollow place which I broke into when clearing away the whitewash from the inside of the chancel ; after a short distance this hollow narrowed very much, and then led off in a sloping direction towards the east, and apparently going upwards through the thickness of the wall, as if there had been a fireplace at some time hereabouts ; there was no appearance of soot, as in the flue found in the tower ; in this hollow I found a relic of the sports of other days, in the shape of a tennis bah. The presence of this tennis ball seems to imply a continuation of the flue, ending with an outlet in the wall ; through this opening, which cannot now be seen, the ball had doubtless entered, and then rolled down until it stopped where I found it, which was about 5 feet from the level of the chancel floor. Putting aU these circum stances together, it seems not unlikely that there was a small sacristy attached to this church in former times. As it might be thought an omission not to notice the bell of this church, I may as well state that the date is 1736, and the initials of the founder W.E."], [385, "EAST WINDOW, CHANCEL OF CHERITON CHURCH,"], [386, ""], [387, "199 Small Portion of Glebe Land on the N.

It may be a matter of importance to some future incumbent of Cheriton, to know, that not far from the house caUed the PU1 House, in the parish of Llanmadoc, there are a few perches of land belonging to Cheriton Glebe, but now completely detached from it, in consequence of the river cutting itself a new channel, There are several people now living who remember the river making a considerable bend here, and the lighters coming through an old channel, now quite filled up, and loading limestone quite close to the rough road at the foot of the quarries. This bend formed a nose of land formerly on the east side of the river bank, and part and parcel of the glebe land, but now completely separated form it, owing to the circumstances above related. It is sometimes a convenience to the lighter men to bring up their lighters and discharge their coals here, when they have not sufficient water to take them to the proper landing place, a few hundred yards higher up ; for this privilege it is the custom of the owners of these small vessels, to give their services one day every year, in harvest time, to the tenant of the glehe farm ; and in. this way the right and title to this bit of land has been kept up ever since the river changed its course, Population of Cheriton Parish, In an old Survey of Dr. Richard Davies, Bishop of St. David's, taken in 1563 the number of houses in Cheriton parish was 29, and putting down five as the number of inmates of each house \u2014 as low estimate \u2014 would give us a population of 145 persons. 1563 \u2014 Parochia de Chyryton, Housholdes 29, population 145 1811 \u2014 From the population Act of Geo.

Although the labour of collecting and arranging the large amount of matter relatmg to this parish has been very great, I hope it will be a source of as much satisfaction to my readers, as it has been to me, to find, that so much documentary and historical evidence exists, bearing upon the history of one of the most notable places in West Gower in former days; and which has still, in its venerable Church and ancient monuments, and many local surround ings, much to interest us. What this place might have been called before the introduction of Christianity in these parts in the sixth century, by SS. David, Cennydd, Iltyd, and others, I have been unable to discover, but since that time, it has been known by the name of Llangenydd, pronounced Llangennith ; a purely Welsh word, meaning the Church of S. Cennydd; whose wonder ful life as given by Capgrave, will appear further on, in the pages of this work. The parish therefore took its name from the Church. Perhaps the earliest historical mention of Llan genydd, is that which we meet with in the Liber Landavensis, the great Eegister Book of Llandaff Cathedral, compiled for Bishop Urban, in the twelfth century. It is there spoken of under the names of B"], [398, "2 Conuoi, and Langenei; the latter is the way in which it is still called by the inhabitants; amongst them, you will seldom hear the full sound of Llan genydd, but almost invariably shortened into Llan genny. Here it is interesting to find, that the form of pronunciation in vogue at the present day, is supported by such ancient authority. I should mention however, that the orthography of the names of places in the Liber Landavensis, is often incorrect, and is generally so in all old writings; arising in the first place, from the difficulty of rendering Welsh names into Latin, for all the old MSS. are in the Latin tongue; and secondly, from the errors of transcribers, in making copies of the original work ; hence it has followed, that many errors have crept into the text, and the names of places have been much turned and twisted about, and so unlike the real names, that it is oftentimes a matter of some difficulty to identify them. However no great harm has been done in the present instance, and the true name has been preserved tolerably well. It is also sometimes written Llangenydyr. On reading the heading of the subjoined notice, one might think that \" Conuoi, and Langenei,\"\"\"\" were two distinct places ; such however is not the case, they are one and the same, as will be seen when we come to the passage, \" terr\u00e6 Conuoy id est Lanngemei,\" that is, \" of the land of Conuoy, which is Langemei\"; here Llangenei is written Lanngemei, an error of a letter only, which is very trifling ; but it shows how loosely the names * By referring to Rees's edition of the Liber Landavensis, it will be seen that this word is variously written in the different MS. copies of that work."], [399, "[nv\\cr Dpoi\"W\u00abij as Liana tnnvhh Church ."], [400, ""], [401, "3 of places were written in those early times, when even in the same document they are seen to vary, and are not always spelt alike.

This would be about the latter part of the 6th, or the beginning of the 7th century : authorities disagree as to the year when he succeeded to the See of Llandaff. The grant is as follows: \u2014 Cilcin/tinn, et vi modios terr\u00e6 Conuoi, et Lanngenei.

Elsewhere, in the pages of the same book, Llangenydd, written Lanngemie, appears, together with the names of several other Gower parishes, in a bull of Pope Callixtus II. , addressed to Bishop Urban, A.r>. 1119; and again, in a bull of Pope Honorius II. , addressed to the same Bishop a.d., 1128 ; and in another of the same Pope to Urban, A.D., 1129. These bulls relate to the very serious dispute that took place at that time between Bernard, Bishop of St. David's, and Urban, Bishop of Llandaff, as to who had the right of Episcopal jurisdiction over the district of East and West Gower. The matter was brought before the Roman Pontiff several times, who gave his decision in favour of Urban, and enjoined the Inhabitants of Gower, who were written to on the subject, to pay canonical obedience to the Bishop of Llandaff: the injunction was however never obeyed, and from that day to the present time, the rural deaneries of East and West Gower have remained under the Episcopal jurisdiction of the Bishop of St. David's, though it is perfectly clear that previous to that time, they were in the diocese of Llandaff. It is reported that they are to revert to Llandaff again. In another place in the Liber Landavensis, Llangenydd, is written \" Lanncinith,\" all which variations, show, that little regard was paid to the"], [404, "6 spelling, as long as some semblance of the name was retained. But indeed we ought not to wonder at this, when even in our o wn day, the names of places are not always written alike; and it was only during the last ordnance survey, that the true orthography of the names of places, parishes, etc., in Gower, was finally settled. This had to be done by a special committee of men, learned in the Welsh tongue; and in many instances gave rise to a good deal of discussion, before a determination could be arrived at. So that we may say, that it is only now, towards the close of the nineteenth century, we know what the real names are, and how to write them. For example, the adjoining parish of Llan madoc, sometimes spelt with a final k, more correctly with a final c, has been deprived of the c, and written with a final g, and stands in the ordnance survey as Llanmadog; and as this point has been settled by some of the best Welsh scholars, we must accept it for the future as the true orthography. Having said so much on the antiquity and etymology of the parish, we must now proceed to the history of the COLLEGE, PRIORY, AND CHURCH OF LLANGENYDD. In the voluminous collection of ancient MSS. made by the late Mr Edward Williams (better known, perhaps, as Iolo Morganwg), we meet with several notices of Llangenydd, and the celebrated Bangor, or college, established there by S. Cennydd. Mention is also made of several of those pious and"], [405, "7 learned men, who shared with him the duties of the college, and who received part of their education there, and helped to spread and establish the Christian faith in Gower and other parts of Wales. \" Cennyd, the son of Gildas of y Coed Aur; his churches are Senghenydd, in Morganwg, where he established a college, and where the Castle of Sen ghenydd was afterwards erected; and Llangenydd in Gower.\" Vide Iolo MSS., p. 497. On page 514 of the same work, we meet with another notice as follows : \" St. Cennydd, the son of Gildas of Coed Aur, formed a Bangor in Llangennydd in Gower, and another in Senghennyd (Caerphilly), which were destroyed by the Pagan Saxons.\" Again on p. 516 of the same work, we have a third notice, much to the same effect as the preced ing one: \" Cennyd established a church and college in Llangenydd in Gower, and another college in Sen ghenydd, that was destroyd by the Pagans, and the present castle is on its site.\" We learn from the same authority, that S. Cen nydd himself was educated at S. Iltyd's College at Llantwit, near Cowbridge, in this county, and at one time the great University for Wales, containing in its best days more than two thousand students; it flourished up to the time of the conquest of Gla morgan by Fitzhamon, a.d. 1091, when its revenues, according to some, were transferred to Tewksbury. The account here given of S. Cennydd's educa tion, will be found to be rather at variance with that"], [406, "8 given in his life by Capgrave, and I will not attempt to reconcile them; in the latter, however, it is given in the form peculiar to medi\u00e6val times, in which a good deal of fiction was invariably introduced, and which has not gone out of fashion in writing biogra phies in the present day.

S. Paul calls Timothy his \" own son in the faith ;\" persons being frequently styled the sons of those under whose spiritual care they had been brought up, a form of speaking in use at the present clay.

The Bangors existed before the monasteries were established, and after that, they ceased to exist, excepting such as became monasteries; vid. Iolo MSS., p. 514. Bangor means high choir, alias High School, alias University. The subjects taught at these places were the Holy Scriptures, music, and the notation of it, accounts, grammar, writing, Latin, agriculture, and all the mechanical arts, as turning and carpentry; in short every known art was taught and practised in the monasteries; and as idleness was bad for the soul as well as the body, manual labour of some kind formed part of the every day work of the monks and their pupils. Many of them were noted for their skill in gold and silver smiths' work ; they were admirable carvers and excellent painters, and many of the old cathedral clocks were made by them. In the Paston letters, ii. 30, Sir John Paston requests Harcort of the Abbey to ' ' send him a little clokke which was sent him to be mendid.\" An astro nomical clock made by Lightfoot, monk of Glaston bury, about the year 1325, is still preserved at Wells, vid. Fosbrooke's Brit. Monachism, 3rd ed., p. 184. The well known story of St. Dunstan and the Devil will not be out of place here, as serving to illustrate what has been said above as to the craftsmanship of the monks ; he flourished in the tenth century, was Abbot of Glastonbury, and one of the best smiths of his day. The story is thus told in the quaint form peculiar to all the old legendary lore. \" And whan Saynt Dunston was c"], [408, "10 wery of prayer, thenne used he to werke wyth hys owne hondes for to eschew ydelness, and he gave alwey almesse to poure peple, for the loue of God. And on a tyme, as he sat at his werke, his herte intent on Jhesu Crist, and his hondes besy at his werke,\" the devil appeared in the form of a young woman, and began to say many things to him which had \" no manner of vertu therein ;\" this made S. Dunstan suspect the true character of his visitor, and taking a red hot tongs out of the fire, he applied it to the tempter's nose, who thereupon resumed his proper shape, and roared dreadfully, like an evil spirit as he was ; but S. Dunstan, nothing daunted by his horrid yells and hideous appearance, held him on for a considerable time, but at length being let loose, he fled away, vowing vengeance. Vid. Graphic and Historical Illustrator, 1834, p. 36.1. S. Dun stan's anvil and tongs have been preserved to the present day, and may still be seen at the town of Mayfield, in Sussex. In order to preserve something like a chronolo gical arrangement of matter, perhaps this would be the best place to insert the legendary life of S.

Terras vero relinquens in celo premia pcepturus migravit Kalendis Augusti. TKANSLATION. Of S. Cennydd, Confessor. There is a certain land, anciently called Letania,* but now lesser Brittany, where a certain Prince, sprung of Royal descent, Dihocus by name, had a very lovely daughter, who conceived a son by a most unnatural t sin. In those days Arthur ruling all Britain, when he held his court on Christmas day, in a province named Soyer, \\ ordered the chiefs, subject to him, to assemble at the aforesaid place; amongst whom, the Prince of Brittany, obedient to the Royal command, took his way, and brought his daughter with him. But when the time was ful filled that she should be delivered, she gave birth to a son, in the tents, pitched about a mile from the palace of King Arthur. But the boy's leg stuck to his thigh, and he could not by any means straighten it, thus \u00a7 signifying the great sin of his conception. Then by the command of the Prince, the servants placed the boy in a certain cradle woven of wicker work, twigs having been placed underneath, and when the boy was put into it, they cast that vessel * Th- Latinised form of the Welsh name Llydaw, under which Brittany, the Roman Armonca, was known to our Celtic forefathers. t I need scarcely remind those who are acquainted with the Latin tongue, that a literal translation of the text in this place was hardly possible. J I think that the initial letter of this word should be G not S ; a mistake either of the copyist or printer ; there can be no doubt that the district of Gower is intended. $ Here again for good and sufficient reasons, a literal translation of the Latin text could hardly be given."], [415, "17 into the torrent; nevertheless before they cast him into the river, the infant received the grace of baptism from a certain priest. But the river,* as if his nurse, carried him to a greater river, now called Lothur,t and the larger river with its rapid stream, swiftly carried the boy out to sea. And presently the sea was boiling up with a sudden motion in itself, as if the depth of the abyss was mingling with the parts above, and a violent tempest suddenly arose, and drove the cradle without its being rent, over the tops of the waves, and without its being overturned. When therefore the boy was driven by the waves along the shore, he drew near to an island, called in Welsh, Ynis Weryn, \\ in Latin, Turbe. And lo ! on a sudden the sea birds, in very great numbers, flew round about the boy, and snatched him from the waves with their beaks and talons, and raising him up into the air, were rejoicing to touch him on all sides, above and below. Flying for awhile hither and thither, they placed the child on a rock, and stood round him in troops; and they formed a certain bed out of a heap of various sorts of feathers, and expelled the serpents and reptiles from the place, and kept off the winds and hail and snow, with the shelter of their wings. And whilst * The river Llyw, a small river which runs on the south side of the village of Lloughor, and falls in the large river Lhvchwr near the church. t Evidently the large river Llwchwr is here meant. It is quite clear that the original compiler of S. Cennydd's life had no knowledge of the Welsh tongue, hence the reason of these Welsh names being so incorrectly written in the story wherever they occur. t Whatever may be the meaning of \" Henisweryn,\" its Latin equivalent is said to be \" turbe.\" I think however that there is very little doubt but that the Wormshead island is here intended. With respect to the identity of Henisweryn and other places herein mentioned, and the locality and scene of the early lite of S. Cennydd, vid. remarks on the Wormshead, in my notices of Rhosilly parish."], [416, "18 the child was thus lying in his bed, before the ninth day had passed by, an angel of God descended to him, bringing with him a certain brazen bell, and placed it to the mouth of the little child. And he, when he was hungry, (just as an infant turns himself to his mother's breast,) so he turned his face to the said bell. But that bell had a brazen breast, after the particular fashion of the female breast, as much as suckling infants dip into their mouth, which the little child taking into his mouth, sucked like the breast of his mother, which gave to the mouth of the infant the sweetest savour of infantile nou rishment, more desirable than all mother's milk, and the honey of the honey-comb, and as in ancient times, the manna afforded the fathers * every relish ment of flavour, for in Welsh it is called to this day Cloch Tethauc, that is being interpreted, the Titty bell. But the secretions which childhood naturally discharges in its retirements, he never did, for he was fed with a most subtile food, which had no secretion. Such a life he led in his little couch, until such time as he was naturally able to walk. The clothes in which he was wrapped, adapted them selves to the circumference of the boy, according to his size and increasing measure, just like the bark growing round a tree ; neither were the little clothes affected by any decay. When these things were being done, it happened that a certain villager, who lived by the sea side, and had no children, as he was one day walking along the sea shore, saw afar * i.e., the Israelites in the Wilderness."], [417, "19 off, divers winged fowl assemble in crowds together, at a certain place ; and when he had come there, he found the most pleasing infant, and taking him away from the birds, he bore him in his arms to his wife, saying, \" O wife, although fortune has stood much against us, the things which we have lost through long barrenness, have been restored to us by the consolation of finding this infant. Do you take to the bed, after the manner of those bearing children, and we will say that you have brought forth that child.\" And when this was done, suddenly crowds of many winged fowl, came rushing together with loud cries, to the house of the aforesaid rustic; and dividing themselves into two bands, one part attacked his home, and with their rapacious beaks and crooked talons, strewed the roof which covered it upon the ground ; the other party made an assault upon their beasts of the field, and drove them headlong to the sea shore. Then the man and his wife dumbfounded with astonishment, having consulted together, carried the boy back to the aforesaid island, where he had been found. And when the infant had been re placed in his cradle, constructed of various feathers, straightway the covering prostrated by the birds, was replaced in its own position upon the home, and the flocks driven to the sea returned to their pastures, and the places from which they had been taken. But when the blessed Cynnyd had grown older, every day, and twice a day, a hind of the wood, bringing her udder heavy and distended with milk to the spot where the bell had been placed, and standing over it, turned upside down, used to fill it"], [418, "20 by milking herself, albeit whatever remained over and above of milk in her udder, she used to let down into the cavity of the rocks. But when the period of childhood was passed, and he had come to youthful estate, now refusing those softer kinds of food, he studied to be fed with coarser sorts, and having frequently spoken with the angel, learned with what food he should recruit his body, and received the doctrine, that the coarser it was, the more pleasing it would be to God. He used to feed therefore upon five sorts of herbs, found on five plants of different kinds, growing wild. Leading a hermit's life in that island for eighteen years, he was taught letters by an angel ; and when those* were fulfilled, the angel of the Lord said to him, \" 0 divine searcher of Scripture, constant and immoveable lover of truth, since the grace of God suffices thee, the Lord thy God has determined that thou shouldest relinquish this habitation, and it is necessary for thee to enter upon another which I will show thee. \" To whom the Saint (replied), \"Although by the sweetness of this place, as if my native place, I feel called to linger, to whatever place thou mayest direct to take my way, I am prepared and ready.\" To whom the angel (replied), \" There is a place, hedged about with a dense covering of reeds, about a mile distant, about to become suitable for divine duty. Therefore break off delay, and take thy journey diligently, for God is with thee.\" The Saint therefore taking his journey in the heat of the day, when he had reclined himself, * i.e, years."], [419, "21 being weary, suddenly a river of the purest water bursting out, flowed forth from the dry ground, from which he drank, and accomplished the attempted work. And when again wearied, he had thrown himself upon the earth, the ground opening itself, gave the clearest spring; and before that he had reached the place pointed out by the angel, in the places where when wearied, he quietly reposed his limbs, the earth produced twenty-four springs, run ning down into the plain. He constructed a cell out of oziers, and thatched it with reed ; and in the oratory built there, a heavenly host very frequently met him, and conversed with him. A certain layman came to him, that he might discharge the life of a hermit, by serving him, whom having been kindly admitted, lived with the Saint many years. Nine robbers coming into that province, pressed with hunger and thirst, said among themselves, there is a certain Saint not far from here, who loves and instructs all, and he refreshes the strong as well as the weak, he invites the destitute and wayfarers, and even to evil doers he is gentle. Let us go there fore to him that he might succour our need. And when they had arrived there, they were quickly received into the Hospice. It happened that the servant of the holy man, beholding the lances of the robbers placed out of doors, and admiring their beauty, took one, and hid it in a secret place. When those robbers went out, a certain one of them asked of the servant of the man of God if he had seen his spear; but he declared with an oath that he knew nothing. Having heard this, the man of God called E"], [420, "22 his servant, saying, \" Friend, those strangers came not to us to lose their goods\"; to whom (he replied) \" Let our Titty bell be brought here, and I will swear upon it that I have not done that thing, and that T know nothing thereof.\" And when he had sworn, and had touched that bell with his hand, immediately losing his natural senses, he was tumbled hither and thither with a horrible fury and madness of mind ; and forthwith going out, and arriving at the sea, he feared not the waves, but walked upon the sea, and having passed over it, he ran over the mountains and valleys and scrubby places, and hastening towards Menevia where S. David had habitations, he lived upon the food of wild beasts, eating herbs and roots. He passed seven years, and his hair covered his body after the manner of a beast, even to his feet. But when the seven years were up, it came into the mind of S. Cennyd about his servant, and moved with fatherly affection, he broke forth into prayer: \" God loving and pitiful, to whom it belongeth to show pity, recall the attack of thy wrath, and be pleased to restore my servant to his former senses, if he be alive, but if otherwise, out of the abundance of thy pity, show mercy to his soul.\" Having finished his prayer, behold his servant re called by the will of God, returned at the hour of ,. Prime;* and the sea having been passed over as before, entering the oratory of the Saint, and as to his outward man, all covered with hair, thus ad- * i.e., at 6 a.m., when the office of Prime was said. This is the first of the seven daily canonical hours kept in all conventual establishments ; the othet offices are Terce, at 9 a.m. ; Sext, at \\z noon ; Nones, at 3 p.m. ; Vespers, at 6 p.m. ; Compline, at 9 p.m. ; Matins and Lauds at midnight."], [421, "23 dressed the servant of God. \" Servant of God, to wait upon whom is a greater privilege than to reign over the whole world, receive me although unworthy, under thy roof, the sharpness of the divine wrath has ceased in me, and what He deservedly took away, by the favour of His grace, He has mercifully granted to me.\" To whom the Saint (replied), \" What He forgives, no one is constrained to impute, and since you have given satisfaction to God, you have pleased me; you have therefore done well to come, and be unwilling to sin any more, and acknowledge thy God to be the avenger of sin, and the bestower of pardon.\" Tarrying there a long time after these things, he lived in a most holy manner, severe in tolerating any evils. A certain Prince named Morgan, had for his dominion, the land now called Glamorgan, and the land adjoining, as far as the river Wye; and a dis turbance having taken place, a certain army was moved to those parts where the Saint lived ; and the booty of the whole country having been taken, it returned. The servant of the man of God being sent, bearing the Titty bell in his hand, demanded back some of the booty. But they began to deride, rating him, and threatened him very much. But a great contention having broken out for the division of the prey, the army mutually wounded each other in a deadly manner, neither did the rage of that fierce fight cease, until all were given up to death. When the servant of the Saint saw this, he brought together the prey to its own place, whence it had gone out, and the poor people unjustly despoiled, received their own with joy. But the Prince of e 2"], [422, "24 Glamorgan hearing that God, by the merits of the holy man, had permitted his enemies to be destroyed by mutual slaughter, came to him, and giving him thanks, begged him to ask what he would of him, and he should obtain it without delay; who, when he said that he desired nothing, at length with great difficulty only sought that he would give him a small bit of land, for a refuge for poor people. To whom the Prince (replied), \" Come with me to the moun tain;\" and when they had come there, he said, \" Make as your own as much as you wish, out ofthe surrounding provinces ;\" and he (replied), \" I will not ask what is too much, or what your heirs or assigns could take away; there is a certain river running down, not far from here, let that be the boundary of my possession\"; and so it was done. S. David, Teilo, and Paternus, making a journey for the conso lation of the brethren, came to the man of God, who rejoicing at their arrival, kindly received them, and as well as he could, to the reverend fathers, administered the rights of hospitality. But the blessed David had given out, that there should be a general Synod, and took care to invite the more humble S. Cennyd there; who says, \"I deservedly having crooked limbs, am unworthy to have society, and more unworthy am I to be associated with such men, and moreover natural strength renders me incapable of undertaking the journey.\" S. David replies, \" Let us beseech Jesus Christ, * that he might think worthy to straighten your limbs, to * I am uncertain what word the abbreviation in the Latin text might stand for : I have ventured to translate it Christ."], [423, "25 journey with us ; and prayer having been made to the Lord, the leg is released from the thigh, even as the natural position ought to be. And when they were equally prepared to commence to take the journey, and were setting out, Cynnyd the servant of God, having poured out a petition from the secrets of his heart, his leg stuck to his thigh as before. Then S. David the Bishop said, \" Why do you despise our society, when we rejoice in your company? Why do you, 0 pious father leave us, anxious in your absence, when by your presence we might be able to lighten the burden of our care.\" And when they had mutually saluted each other, the Bishops departed, and he returned to his own place. I saw many other things in one place only in Wales, written about that glorious Confessor, which being obliterated as it were by age, could not be read. Leaving the earth however to receive rewards in heaven, he departed on the calends of August. According to a short notice of this Saint by Wm. of Worcestre which will appear further on, he died on the 3rd day after the Feast of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, that is, on the 27th of June, but the year is not given. In the old Welsh Chronicle, called the Brut-y- Twysogion, i.e., the Chronicle of the Princes, we learn, that towards the close of the tenth century, a dreadful calamity overtook the Monastery and Church of S. Cennydd. \" In 986 the Danes ravaged Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset, and landed in Gwyr (i e., Gower), and destroyed the Monastery of Cen nydd, and other churches.\" Vid. Appendix to the"], [424, "26 Rev. Peter Roberts' translation of the Chronicle of the Kings of Britain, A.D. 1811, p. 326. A tradition of this calamity still lingers in the neighbourhood, and is to the effect, that when the Danes were intent on burning the Church, plundering the houses, and massacreing the people, some of the inhabitants went down to the sea-shore, and cut the cables of the vessels, and set them on fire. If one may be allowed to theorize a httle on the foregoing statement, given in the Brut-y-Twysogion, taken in connection with the local tradition, we may perhaps be enabled to trace the origin of the deep trench and rude camp on the Burry Holmes, hard by, and to fix the probable date of its construction, viz.. a.d. 986. For when these terrible sea-king rovers found their vessels consumed, and their retreat by sea cut off, nothing would be more likely than for them to retire to some such spot as this, and entrench themselves here, until a fresh fleet of their countrymen could come to their assistance, and for this they were not kept waiting very long, for in the next year, we learn from the same authority, the Brut-y-Twysogion, that the fraternities of Llanbadarn, St. David's, Llan Illtyd, Llan Gannon, Llan Rhysted and Llan Dydock, were destroyed by the same people. It would appear from the short notice of the life of Caradoc of Llancarvan, given in the preface to the Brut-y-Twysogion, by the Rev. John Williams, M.A., a.d. 1860, that the Monastery and Church of S. Cennydd, remained in ruins for many years after the above-mentioned disaster. Mr. Williams states, that Caradoc at one period of his life, retired to the"], [425, "27 \" desolate Church of S. Kened.\" Caradoc was born about the middle of the eleventh century, and as he had arrived at man's estate when he took up his abode at Llangennydd, the Church must have been in a state of ruin towards the end of the eleventh century; indeed the times were so troublous, that what with the constant incursions of the Danes, and the frequent devastations of Gower by the Welsh Princes, there was little chance of the Church being restored; but at the close of the eleventh century, or very early in the twelfth, a new Church was certainly erected on the ruins of that burnt by the Danes, in 986, and consecrated by Herwald, Bishop of Llandaff. On p. 550 of the Liber Landavensis, we have the following interesting record of that event, together with the names of some of the early priests, and mention is also made of the assumption of the monk's habit by Caradoc. Perhaps some of my readers will be quite satisfied if I omit the Latin text on this occasion, and give the English transla tion, as rendered by the Rev. W. J. Rees, M.A., F.S.A., the learned editor of that work. \" Of the Consecration of several Churches, and the Ordination of their Ministers.' \"When King William conquered England, Bishop Herwald held the Bishoprick of the Church of Llan daff from the mouth of the Wye to the river Towey, with all episcopal dignity and subjection. In which time Cadwgan son of King Mewrig reigned in Gla morgan, as far as the ford of the Trunk on Towy, and King Caradoc reigned in Ystradw, Gwent Uchoed,"], [426, "28 and Gwnllwg, and Rhydderch in Ewyas and Gwent Iscoed. Which before-named Kings were subject to King William, and died in his time; whose aforesaid territories, with the district of Ergyng, Bishop Her wald held in episcopal subjection. And in whose time Sandde a priest officiated in the Church of Lanhardneu, and after him his son Daniel In Pembre, Cadfor son of Mor. ... In Lanelli Umel was priest. . . . In Lanncinith, Bywgi son of Edwyn, afterwards Cyfelyn, afterwards lago Goch, afterwards Albrit; in which Church Bishop Herwald ordained Caradoc a holy and religious man, to be a monk . . . which aforesaid churches Bishop Herwald consecrated, and he also ordained the aforesaid Clergy.\" The death of Bishop Herwald took place in 1104, and as we know the Church was in a state of deso lation towards the close of the eleventh century, from the circumstance of Caradoc leading at that time a herimetical life amid its ruins, we may fairly infer that the new Church was in all probability erected at the opening of the twelfth century. Furthermore, the foregoing extract establishes the fact, that the Monastery of Llangennydd, had the honour of numbering amongst its inmates, one of the most celebrated of all the ancient Welsh histo rians, the illustrious Caradoc of Llancarvan, who as the author of the Brut-y-Twysogion (the Chronicle of the Princes), has left us one of the most valuable records of early Welsh history. I should mention, that Mr. Williams in his preface to that work, states, that Caradoc took the monk's cowl at Llandaff, im-"], [427, "29 plying I conclude, the Cathedral. I do not know on what authority he makes this statement, all I can say is, that we have it on the authority of the Liber Landavensis, which can hardly be disputed, that that episode in the life of Caradoc took place in Llan gennydd Church, Gower, and that he received the tonsure there, at the hands of Bishop Herwald. At this time Gower was in the Diocese of Llandaff, later on in the same century, it became part of the Diocese of S. David's. We now come to a period in the history of Llan gennydd, when the rule of the Norman Barons comes to the front ; one of whom, Roger de Bellomont, son of Henry de Newburgh, Earl of Warwick, the con queror of Gower, founded a religious house, called a Priory, here, in the reign of King Stephen. The fact is mentioned in Dugdale's Monasticon, and in Tanner's Notitia Monastica. Dugdale's notice is as follows : \u2014 Priory of Llangenith, in Glamorganshire. Roger de Bellomont, Earl of Warwick is said to have conquered Gowerland in Wales, and to have thereupon founded a Priory hei*e in the reign of King Stephen, and to have annexed it to the Abbey of St. Taurinus at Evreux in Normandy. It was dedicated to St. Kenned, and being seized as an alien Priory, was granted by King Henry the Sixth a.d. 1441 to All Souls' College, Oxford.\" Vid. Dug. Baron., vol. i., p. 69. Hist, of Warwick, p. 379. F"], [428, "30 Tanner's notice is much the same : \u2014 \" Llangenith.\" \" An alien Priory to the Abbey of St. Taurinus at Evreux. After the dissolution* it was annexed by Henry Chicheley, Archbishop of Canterbury, to All Souls' Coll. Oxford.\" Vid. Tanner's Not. Monast. Glam., Oxford, 1698. Before proceeding to the very copious and inter esting documents verifying the above statements of Dugdale and Tanner, it is necessary to mention that I think the former has made a slight mistake in imputing the conquest of Gower to Roger de Bello monte; he might indeed have given the finishing stroke to what his father had done, but nothing more, and perhaps this was all that Dugdale may have intended ; for the weight of evidence is clearly to the effect, that the conquest of Gower was achieved by Henry de Newburgh, Earl of Warwick, as I have already shown in Part 1st of my History of West Gower. There is however one reference omitted there, which I now supply, it is found in Ross' Warwick, p. 1 10. \" Non multo post Henricus de Newburgo Comes Warrewicci et Novoburgi conqui sivit gladio super Wallenses terram qu\u00e6 dicitiur Goherland.\" From the statement of Dugdale, given above, the Priory must have been erected by de Bellomonte some years after the Church, for Bishop Herwald died in 1104, and King Stephen came to the throne in 1135. The exact year when the Priory was built * i.e. the Dissolution of the Alien Priories."], [429, ""], [430, ""], [431, "31 is not given, all we know is that it was erected by the Norman Baron above-named, and in the reign of that King, that is between the years 1135 and 1154, which was the period of Stephen's reign. John Leland, the Antiquary, and chaplain to Henry VIII., alluding to the appropriation of this Priory by Chicheley, to All Souls' College, has this notice : \u2014 ''Henricus Chicheley Episcopus Menevensis translatus ad Cantuar-fundator fuit collegii omnium Sanctorum, Oxon : cui appropriavit fanum S. Clar\u00e6 Langenia, & Langenith in Gowerland.\" Vid. Leiand's Collectanea, vol. ii., p. 324., Hearne's edit. Tanner speaking of his references to this Priory, says: \u2014 \" Cartas ad hunc prioratum spectantes in Thesaurio Coll. om. an. Oxon. Pat. 16 Ed. III., p. 2, m. 16. Brev. Reg. 18th Ed. III., p. 2., and Pat. 27th Ed. III., p. i., m. 12, vel. 13, pro Abbate de Lange neth.\" With the exception of the writ of the 18th Ed. III., p. 2, which could not be found though careful search was made for it, I have obtained transcripts of all these papers referred to by Tanner, and was fortunate enough to obtain copies of several others, preserved in the Record Office, in London, but not quoted by him, and probably unknown; at any rate I believe they have never been printed. The result is the publication for the first time, of a great deal of valuable matter relating to the Priory and Church of Llangennydd, by which we are enabled to trace their history through a long series of ages, and that too with a fulness and accuracy that leaves little to be desired. But besides the light which these ancient documents throw upon the history of"], [432, "32 the places to which they refer, there is this additional satisfaction, in knowing that the publication of such papers, by being put into print, are thus safely pre served to posterity, when time or accident shall have perchance destroyed the originals themselves. The Priory of Llangenydd is mentioned in the Taxatio Ecclesiastica of Pope Nicholas IV., a.d. 1 291.

IV. i.e., from 1399 to a.d. 1400, given in my notices of the Parish of Cheriton, it will be seen, that the Prior of Llangenydd was endowed with the right of paunage of hogs, in some certain wood or woods of Gower. It was the duty of a certain officer called the For rester, to render an account to the Prior of Llange nydd, of all sums of money, paid by those who sent"], [433, "33 their pigs to feed on the acorns in these woods. The name of the Forester in the year 1400, was Thomas ap Rees, who accounts, \" in tithe paid to the Prior of Langenith, for paunage of hogs, above charged, and not tithed, 2s.\" Vid. p. 163, Historical Notices of the Parish of Cheriton. As the Priory of Llangennydd was what is called an alien Priory, it will be necessary to explain that by this term is meant a Priory attached to some great religious house, in a foreign country, and such was the case here, the Priory of Llangennith was attached to the Abbey of St. Taurinus, of the Dio. of Evreux in Normandy With the dissolution of all the alien priories in England and Wales by Hen. V., in a.d. 1414, the glory of that of Llangenydd began to decay, and with the confiscation of its revenues which were devoted as already mentioned, by Hen. Chicheley to the building and endowment of All Souls' College, Oxford, in 1442, a death blow was given to the prosperity of its ancient priory; it never recovered it, and from what we now see, we could scarcely form any idea of its former reputation and greatness. If history did not exist to show us what it must have been once like, we could never have supposed that it could have been a place of that consequence that it really was ; yet I think its history as set forth in these pages, will show, that I have not exaggerated its importance, in making such a statement. These alien Priories were subject to many vicissi tudes, their revenues were frequently seized by the F 2"], [434, "34 Enghsh monarchs, to defray the expenses of their wars with France. * They were first taken and em ployed for this purpose by Ed. I., 1285; and it appears from a Close Roll of Ed. III., a.d. 1327, that Ed. II. also seized them. In 1337 t Ed. III. confiscated these estates, and let out the Priories with all their lands and tenements at his pleasure, for 23 years ; at the end of which time, peace being concluded between the two countries, he restored their estates in 1361. The transcripts ofthe patent rolls, and other documents, relating to all these cir cumstances, will prove interesting to my readers, as confirming what is here stated. This then was the usual custom with English sovereigns, with regard to these alien Priories, namely to seize their endow ments when at war with foreigners, and to restore them again in times of peace. At last their fate was finally sealed in 1414, temp. Henry V. The history of the event is rather interesting, for at this time there was an agitation on foot, to deprive the clergy of their revenues, so in order to save themselves, they proposed to the King, that he should seize the alien Priories, whose lands and emoluments would considerably increase the revenue of the Crown. As the King was about to commence a great war, he accepted the proposal, and the lands of these Priories, Llangenydd among the rest, were made over to him by Act of Parliament, in the year above-mentioned, t. * Vid Gougsh's Alien Priories, 1786. t Vid Weever's Funeral Mon., p. 336.

He might have been, and probably was the last Prior pensioned off, vested rights being perhaps respected.

Taurinus, in Normandy, to which it was attached. The monks of this Order wore a black habit, and observed the rule of S. Benedict. From the evidence furnished by these old documents, we also learn the particulars relating to the mode of the appointment to the office of Prior, with the names of the deceased Prior, Richard de Fonte, and that of the new one, Richard de Anjo. We also find in these papers, the names of several persons, Rectors and Vicars of certain parishes in Gower, at that time (a,d. 1400), which has enabled me to fill up some of the gaps in the lists of Incumbents, given in this work. The handwriting in the original (on parchment), is a wonderful specimen of beautiful penmanship, and perfectly legible, a few words are slightly faded here and there; and yet the documents are nearly five-hundred years old. It will be observed that the word dominus is frequently used in the Latin text, and is to be construed variously, according to the rank of the persons thus described. It was a title formerly applied to all the clergy, and for this reason Dominus was the academical title of a Bachelor of Arts, and usually rendered in English by the word Sir, at Universities ; so that a bachelor who in the books stood Dominus Brown, was in conversation called Sir Brown. This practice is still retained in"], [437, "37 some colleges at the present day. Therefore as most of the clergy had taken that first degree, it became usual to style them Sir. Vid.

So that of the issues of the lands, tenements and places aforesaid, and of the goods, chattels and debts aforesaid they may answer to the King, that is to say, of the said issues and goods and chattels aforesaid. Of some issues Of some issues of the Priory of Langeneth from the 23rd day of November in the said 11th year, on which day the aforesaid John took that Priory into the King's hand, together with the goods and chattels there found, up to the third day of January next following he does not answer, because the King granted to the Prior of that place the custody of the Priory aforesaid and of all lands, tenements, goods and chattels and other things whatsoever to the same Priory belonging, together with the issues thereof received from the time of taking the same ; yielding therefor to the King, at the King's Exche quer, 100 shillings by the year at the feasts of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Easter in equal portions; and in the present year past the like 100 shillings, at the feasts of Michaelmas and Easter by equal portions; so long as he should have i"], [450, "50 the custody aforesaid.

With which said one hundred shillings yearly the said Prior by original of the said eleventh year remains charged. . .

The foregoing document is of great interest, as it tells us of an early seizure and restoration again in a.d. 1338, by Ed. III. of all the endowments, &c, appertaining to this Priory. It was not an uncom mon thing, as Dugdale informs us in his Monasticon, for the English Kings to seize these Alien Priories, and use the emoluments for furnishing supplies during then wars with France, and restore them again in times of peace.

TRANSLATION. Patent Roll, 16 Ediv. III., p. 2, m. 26. EXEMPLIFICATION FOR THE ABBOT OF LLAN- GENNITH, IN WALES. The King to all wdiom, &c, greeting. We have inspected the tenor of a certain process had in the Court of Lord Edward, formerly King of England, our Grandfather, before his Barons of Exchequer, which before us in our Chancery for certain causes we have caused to come, in these words : \u2014 Process had before the Barons of Exchequer of King Edward son of King Henry, in the Roll of the estate of the Alien Religious, of the twenty- seventh year of the said King Edward. Lincoln. Be it remembered, that the eighth day of October in the twenty-seventh"], [453, "53 year ending, the twenty-eighth beginning, it is given to the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer to understand, that Thomas de Multon of Frampton holds certain lands and tenements in Salfleteby in the County of Lincoln, of the Abbot and Monks of Langenet of Britain, who are of the power and dominion of the King of France, by the service of yielding to the same by the year 1 9 pounds 1 6 pence halfpenny at the Feast of Saint Michael; and that the aforesaid rent has not been paid to the Lord the King from the time at which war was raised between the King and the said King of the French, by occasion of which war the King caused to be taken into his own hand all lands, and tenements, rents, and possessions, goods, and chattels, which all those who were of the power and dominion of the said King of France, had in the realm of England at the time of the aforesaid war having arisen ; and that the said Thomas has concealed the said rent for the whole time abovesaid, namely, for six years; the Feast of Saint Michael in the 22nd year ending (in which year the said war was first raised) being reckoned for the first term, and the Feast of Saint Michael in the 27th year ending, being reckoned for the last term, whereof the sum is 114-. 8s. 3d. Wherefore the same day the said Thomas is commanded to be before the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer at York on the morrow of Saint Martin, to yield to the King the rent aforesaid, for the whole time afore said and to do further that which the King hereupon shall cause to be ordained. At which day came the said Thomas, and is interrogated by the said Treasurer"], [454, "54 and Barons, wherefore, whereas it was clear to him and ought to be clear to him, that it had been or dained by the Lord the King and his Council, that all issues rents and profits of land and tenements of aliens of tlie power and dominion of the said King of France, in the said realm of England, should by occasion of the said war be taken into the King's hand, and answer thereof should be made to the Kinof at the Exchequer, during the war aforesaid, at the will of the said Lord the King, the said Thomas has concealed the rent aforesaid, for the whole time aforesaid, to the damage and deception of the said Lord the King. And the said Thomas has well acknowledged that he holds the tenements aforesaid of the said Abbot and Monks of Langenet, by the service of yielding to them by the year 19 pounds 16 pence halfpenny at the Feast of Saint Michael. And he says, that he has not concealed the rent aforesaid to the damage of the King, because he says that at the time, at which the war was first raised, and long after, he the said Thomas, was under age, and in the custody of William, late Bishop of Ely, whereby, as it was not made clear to him con cerning the lands, rents, and goods, of such aliens, to be taken into the King's hand, he prays that the default in the said payment be not imputed to him. And he says that, inasmuch as it appears to the Court, that the said Bishop, as guardian of the lands of the said Thomas, has not paid the said rent to the Lord the King for the time in which he has had the custody thereof. And the said Thomas has well acknowledged that he himself has paid nothing"], [455, "55 thereof to the King from the time when he was ot lawful age up to now, he is ready to satisfy the Lord the King as to the aforesaid 114. 8s. Sd. of arrearages of the rent aforesaid, for the aforesaid six years, according to the said ordinance. And of grace it is granted to him by the Treasurer and Barons that he may yield to the King the aforesaid 114_. 8s. 3d. which are in arrear for the time aforesaid ; and that he be not aggrieved or molested because the said rent has been so long in arrear, so that he pay to the King at the Exchequer henceforward, the said 19 pounds 16 pence halfpenny, at the Feast of Saint Michael yearly, and yield nothing thereof to the said Abbot and Monks without the King's special mandate, under heavy forfeiture, etc., until the King shall thereon cause to be ordained otherwise, etc. Afterwards the said Thomas was attermined * of the same debt to pay Ten Pounds by the year at the Feast of Saint Michael, and he shall pay to the King by the year at the same Feast of Saint Michael as well the aforesaid 19 pounds 16 pence halfpenny of the farm aforesaid, so long as the King may will to receive that farm, as the aforesaid 10 Pounds at which he is so attermined by the year at the same term, until the aforesaid 114_. 8s. 3d., being yet (as aforesaid) in arrear, be fully paid to the King. We by the tenor of these Presents have at the request of the Abbot of Llagenet caused the tenor of the Process aforesaid to be exemplified.

P ipm rege nunc Guidone de Brian. The above was transcribed from the original Patent preserved at Penrice Castle. This has the Great Seal of England in a fair state of preservation attached to it. A copy of this document is to be found at the Kecord Office in London, and I obtained a transcript of it, given on page 56, before I had seen the original Patent at Penrice. As will be perceived, the lan guage is the same, with the exception of some verbal matter at the commencement and conclusion. I have been informed by the authorities in the Record Office, that the enrolled copy sometimes differs in a slight degree from the original Patent but the difference is only verbal, as in this case. Another difference between original Patents and enrolled copies is, that the former have seals attached to them, the latter not. From this document we learn that the Abbot and Convent of Margam (here called Morgan) had illegally acquired the right of the Advowson of Llangennith Church, and that there had been a trial about it in the Court of the King's Bench; and that judgment was given in favour of the King. Thereupon the King presents the living to one William Sampson. The Boll however goes on to show, that the King J 2"], [460, "60 charitably forgives the Abbot and Convent of Margam their trespass, and bestows upon them what they had illegally seized, namely the grant in fee of the advowson of the Parish Church, an act of kindness which I should think must have surprised them very much. But in point of fact the true patrons of Llangen nith Church and its venerable Priory, were the Abbot and Convent of St. Taurinus in Normandy. But during Edwai'd's wars with France, the alien Priories and their revenues were invariably seized by the King ; and for a time all rights appertaining to them were exercised by him; and as the Priory of Llan gennith was one of those alien Priories, it came to pass, that the advowson pro tern came into his hands, and was by an act of grace passed on to the Abbey of Margam, Glamorganshire, which had somehow improperly claimed it. When the war was over, and peace restored, all things reverted to their former owners, and the old regime went on as before. GRANT OF THE CUSTODY OF LLANGENNITH PRIORY. Originalia Roll. 4, Henry 4>.

Exchequer (Q.R.) Ancient Misc. 19th Hen. 6th. In the Public Record Office. WRITS AND RECEIPTS RELATING TO THE PRIORY OF LLANGENNITH. Subsidiary to the Account of Richard Hore, Clerk, Farmer of the Priory of Langenyth, in Gower, in Wales, Dated 19 Hen. 6th. A.D. 1441 [translations.] Let all know by these Presents that I Hertank van Clux, have had and received on the day of the making of these Presents, of Richard Hore, Clerk, Farmer, of the Priory of Langenyth, in Gower, in Wales, Twenty Pounds, of those twenty pounds yearly to me by the Lord Henry the Fifth, late King of England, granted, and by the Lord the now King confirmed, to be received for the term of my life from the Priory aforesaid by the hands of the farmers, receivers, or occupiers aforesaid for the time being, at the terms of Saint Michael and Easter, by equal poi-tions, to wit, for the terms of Easter and Saint Michael last past, of which same \u00a320 I confess myself to be paid, and the said farmer thereof acquitted by these Presents, sealed with my seal. Dated the Twelfth day of December, in the nine teenth year of the reign of King Henry the Sixth, after the Conquest.

Witness, Humfry, Duke of Gloucester, Keeper of England, at Westminster, the Twelfth day of October, in the ninth year of our reign. \u2014 Wymbish. A.D. 1431 Let all know by these Presents, that I, Hortonk van Clux, Knight, have had and received on the day of the making of these presents of Robert Bridport, m . . . of the Order of St. Benedict, One Hundred"], [470, "70 pounds of those Twenty pounds yearly to me, by the Lord Henry the Fifth, late King of England, granted, and by the Lord the now King confirmed, to be received every year for the term of my life from the alien Priory of Langenyth, in Gower, in Wales, by the hands of the Farmers, Receivers, or other Occupiers of the same Priory, for the time being, at the terms of Saint Michael and Easter, by equal portions, to wit \u2014 from the feast of Saint Michael, in the fourth year of the reign of King Henry the Sixth, until the Twelfth day of October, in the ninth year of the same King, of which same One Hundred Pounds I confess myself to be paid, and the said Robert Bridport thereof to be quit by these presents. In witness whereof to these pre sents my seal I have placed. Dated the twentieth day of November, in the ninth year of the reign of King Henry the Sixth, after the conquest of England. This name Hortonk von Klux is decidedly Flemish, and is interesting as showing that there were some men of mark and good standing among the number of the Flemish colonists who settled in Gower, though the majority of them were chiefly of the labouring class, as artisans and clothworkers. I have not been able to obtain any information as to the history of Sir Hortonk von Klux, further than what is to be gathered from these old documents ; and his place of abode is not mentioned. It does not follow because he received a pension of Twenty pounds a year from the confiscated endowments of"], [471, "71 this alien Priory that he lived in Gower at all ; but there is a farm in the parish of Llangennith, called Sluxton, which might possibly have been the resi dence of this Knight, and called after him Kluxton, now altered into Sluxton ; just as Barrison, i.e., Barry's town, derived its name from one Barry, a man of note who formerly lived there. We have the same thing again at Kenigstone, i.e., Cenydd's town, in another part of the parish. GRANT TO ALL SOUL'S COLLEGE, OXFORD, OF THE PRIORIES OF ST. CLARE AND LLANGENITH.

The King to all to whom, &c, greeting. Whereas lately, at the prayer of the venerable Father Henry, Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England, our fellow-countryman, we founded under a certain form, a certain college in Oxford, commonly called the college of all faithful souls, deceased, of Oxford, we have willed that the same Archbishop, because of his pious intention and no small costs, charges and expenses, which he has in respect of the erection, founding, and endowment"], [475, "75 of the same college hitherto sustained and proposed to do, should be nominated and become the second founder of the same ; and certain persons hereunder written lately enfeoffed in the lands and tenements and other possessions hereunder written, to the use of the aforesaid Archbishop have made over their estate of and in those lands, tenements, and pos- sessions, by the assent and will of the same Archbishop, in the form hereunder written, that is to say, \u2014 Thomas Chicheley, cleric ; John Birkheed, cleric ; John Bolde, cleric ; and Robert Dan vers, have lately demised, liberated, and by their deed, dated the third day of January, in the year of our reign the twentieth have rendered to us the Manor of Boywurth, one tenement called Horsham, four hundred and sixty-eight acres of land, ten acres of meadow, thirteen acres of pasture, ninety and ten acres of marsh, twenty and one acres of wood, one water grist mill, twenty and one shillings and eight pence rents, and a rent of six quarters and seven bushels of barley, and the rent of six capons with the appurtenances, in Upchurch, Halgest, Newenton, Reynham, Heretelep, Wade Babbynge, Etterham, and Detlynge, in the County of Kent ; four tene- ments with the appurtenances in Oxford, which lately were John Sprunt's ; five messuages, six tenements, with their appurtenances, in Oxford, which lately were William Hales' and Matilda, his wife's ; also the alien Priories of Saint Clare and Llangennith, in South Wales, with the advowson of the Churches and singular the lands, tenements, and their appurtenances, to the same Priories or L 2"], [476, "76 either of them, appurtaining or annexed. Also, the Manor of Eggewere, with the appurtenances, one messuage, fifty acres of land with their appur tenances in Eggewere, in the County of Middlesex, which were lately William Daren's and Elizabeth his wife's, and heretofore Sir Rice le Strange's, of Knothin, Knt. To have and to hold all and sin gular the Manors, lands, tenements, meadows, pastures, marshes, woods, mill rents, and Priories, with their appurtenances and belongings as is aforesaid, to us and our heirs and assigns for ever ; and the aforesaid Thomas, John Birket, and Robert by the aforesaid deed have demised, liberated and surrendered to us the Manor of Kingsbury, three messuages, a hundred acres of land and ten acres of meadow, with their appurtenances, in Kingsbury and Hendon, in the County of Middlesex, to hold the same Manor, messuage, land and meadow to us, our heirs and assigns for ever ; and the aforesaid Thomas and Robert, by the same deed have demised, liberated and surrendered to us tbe Manor called Mallorys, with the appurtenances, in the Parish of Willesden, four messuages, four hundred acres of land, forty acres of meadow, and twenty acres of wood, with the appurtenances, which Robert Clopton, conjointly with others, lately held in Harleston and in the parish of Willesden aforesaid, in the aforesaid County of Middlesex ; also one tenement with its appurtenances in Oxford, lately Roger Skibowe's; and another tenement with its appurtenances, lately John Berford's, in Oxford aforesaid. To have and to hold the Manor, messuages, lands, meadow, wood,"], [477, "77 and those tenements with their appurtenances to us and our heirs for ever. And in like manner the aforesaid John Birket, John Bolde, and Robert, have demised, liberated, and by the aforesaid deed have surrendered to us the Manor of Padbury, four messuages, four plough lands, and forty acres of meadow, with their appurtenances, in Padbury, in the County of Buckingham. To have and to hold the same Manor, land and meadow with then appur tenances, to us and our heirs and assigns for ever, as in the same deed will more fully appear. And we, duly considering the premises, the aforesaid lettings, liberations, and surrenderings having been been made to us as is aforesaid, give our free assent, and wholly and fully by these presents agree to the same. And further, whereas we of and in all and singular the lands, tenements, and possessions aforesaid, by reason of the lettings, liberations and surrenderings aforesaid, stand seized and possessed, being willing therefore with the same to provide for the augmentation, advantage, and usefulness of the aforesaid College, according to the intention and will of the aforesaid Archbishop in this behalf, we have given and granted to our beloved master, Rice Andrew, the Warden, and to the College of all faithful souls, deceased, of Oxford, all and singular, the Manors, lands, tenements, meadows, pastures, and wood, and the Priories of St. Clare and Llan gennith with all and singular their appurtenances above written, together with the advowsons and patronage of the Churches of St. Clare and Llan gennith, and singular the advowsons of Churches,"], [478, "78 Priories, Chapels, and Chantries to the same Manors lands, tenements, meadows, pastures, woods, and priories, and to any of them in any way appur taining. Also view of Frank pledge, amends, assize of bread and beer, with the franchises and liberties of every kind whatsoever, as fully and wholly as the aforesaid persons enfeoffed as is aforesaid or any of them, or any other person have held or occupied them more effectually and fully. To have and to hold all the aforesaid Manors, lands, tenements, meadows, pastures, marshes, mill, wood, and priories. Also view of Frank pledge, and all and singular the above-mentioned, to the aforesaid Warden and Col lege, and their successors for ever, according to the form of the foundation and statutes of the College aforesaid, to be governed for ever, of us and our heirs, and without paying any thing thereat to us or our heirs ; and by the tenon* of these presents we have given special license to the same, the Warden, and College, and their successors, that they may be able to appropriate the aforesaid churches, and hold them for their own use, for themselves and their successors aforesaid, for ever. Provided that the Vicars in the churches aforesaid be endowed, and sufficient sums of money every year according to the ordination of the Diocesan or Diocesans of those places be distributed to the poor of the parish according to the form of the statutes thereof de clared and provided. And that express mention of the true annual value of the said Manors, lands, tenements, meadows, pastures, marshes, mills, wood and priories, and other the premises and any of"], [479, "79 them, and of other gifts or concessions by us to the aforesaid Warden and college heretofore made, be not herein made, or any statute, act, or ordinance to the contrary made or declared notwithstanding. In (testimony) of which, &c, Witness the King at Westminster, 24th day of February. In the foregoing deed mention is made of a Priory called St. Clare's ; this was another alien Priory, situated about 9 miles from Carmarthen, and known at the present day as the parish of St. dear's (Clare's.) With respect to a clause in this deed relating to the distribution of sufficient sums of money among the poor of the parish of Llangennith, it will be interesting to note in the extract taken from the Valor Ecclesiasticus a,nd given elsewhere, that this clause was duly observed, and a sum of six shillings and eightpence from the alms of the church was annually expended in charity. As most of the preceding matter relates to the history of the old Prioiy and the still more ancient College that stood on its site, the church being only incidentally alluded to, I shall now proceed to give some account of the latter, its structure, architec tural merits, early associations, tombs, monuments, and other matters of interest appertaining to it. As has already been seen, the Priory was erected by Roger de \"\"'Beaumont, in the reign of King Stephen ; there is no special reason that I know of, why the church should not have been erected by him also, at * Alias de Bellomonte, the names are synonymous."], [480, "80 an earlier date ; but as I have no means of knowing the exact date of the death of Henry de Newburgh, his father, I should not like to speak positively on this point. It is known that this Earl Roger was more given to religious exercises than to military actions. One thing, however, is perfectly clear, that a church was erected very early in the twelfth cen tury ; and from the evidence before us, one might venture to say, between A.D. 1099, the date of the conquest of Gower, and 1104, the date of the death of Herwald, Bishop of Llandaff, who consecrated it, though the style of the architecture of the present structure points to a later period, namely, early English, of the thirteenth century. It is the largest parish church in West Gower, where as a rule they are very small. The plan is of the usual Gower type, and consists of a nave and chancel, but with the peculiarity of a side tower on the north of the Nave, and attached to it. Freeman speaking of the slits in the tower, says, that \" here they are advanced to the dignity of windows, small indeed, but still real lancets and not loop holes.\" One of these lancets on the West face was walled up in 1849, when he visited the church ; on clearing it out in 1882, when the tower whs restored, a very beautiful lancet window was disclosed, of a most unusual and interesting type, and forms one of the illustrations in the pages of this work. On the east side of this tower there is a blocked Romanesque arch, with a small lancet in it : Mr. Freeman thinks that this arch, which is not an arch of construction, could only have intended to open to some building to be attached to"], [481, "Windtirt in th,. tower of |_ Ian qerx txvtli Cku.rch,."], [482, ""], [483, ""], [484, "Font (j' LLa.n.gert.rvi.tk Church'"], [485, "81 the north of the chancel, but which was probably never erected. But at this distance of time it is difficult to say what buildings may have been stand ing around and contiguous to the church ; the old Priory certainly touched it on the south side, and a blocked up doorway on that side, and opening directly into a small garden, points clearly enough to the existence of a small cloister, by which the monks and students from the Priory passed to say their daily offices and keep the rule of S. Benedict. Not a vestige of such cloister is now to be seen ; some few old walls and disjointed buildings, crowding and abutting the south side and west end of the church, and now turned into barns, stables, cow houses, &c, show, that once upon a time there was on this side of the church an extensive block of ecclesiastical buildings. The modern farm house, built a few years ago, now stands upon the site of a more ancient edifice then taken down, to make room for the new house, and which from time immemorial went by the name of the College, and the new build ing still retains that appellation. In the pine end of what is now a kind of outhouse, there is a lofty pointed arch, walled up, which evidently appertained to some goodly structure ; I once heard that there was a tradition that this arch was the entrance to the chapel of the Priory.\"\" In scaling off the many coats of whitewash with which the font had been covered, some simple sten cilling came to light, which I carefully copied and * Vide Notes on the architectural antiquities of Gower, by Ed.

Goddard, of Swansea, who supplied the drawing, and most of the others, which form the illustrations of this third volume. In a niche on the south side of the nave, there is a mutilated effigy of a Knight in armour, ringed mail, with hood of the same. This figure is called by the inhabitants the \" Dolly Mare,\" evidently a corruption of the Knight's name, and there is very little doubt that it represents one of the great Norman family of the de la Mers, who were amongst the earliest \u2014 perhaps the very first \u2014 of that race in Gower, and whom we find at Oxwich, and owners of Knight's fees both there and here. Effigies of two members of the same family, a Knight and his lady, in an excellent state of preservation, may be seen in a canopied niche in the chancel of Oxwich Church, and of whom I shall have more to say if I am spared to publish my notices of that parish. From the kind of armour on the figure in Llangenydd Church, we know it cannot be later than the close of the thirteenth century ; for at the beginning of the fourteenth, about A.D. 1307 the armour changed, and the fashion of mixed mail and plate came in. There were de la Mers of Llangenydd early in the fourteenth century, as we learn from a charter of John Voyl to Sir Robert de Penres, Kt., a transcript of which will appear in the notices of Llanrhidian parish. In an inquisitio post mortem of the 11th Hen. VI., A.D. 1433, concerning the lands, &e, of John de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, and Lord of the Seigniory of Gower, Llangenydd is then returned"], [487, "Ancient stencilling on the f mt of LLa-n-qtn rvu Ud Church/."], [488, ""], [489, ""], [490, "Mu-fevlo.tt-i.i- effigy of a.

This was doubtless the West town manor, as the East town, alias Prior's town manor, was held by the Warden and Fellows of All Souls' College, Oxford. The greater part of the legs of this effigy in Llangennydd Church is gone, but enough remains to indicate a cross-legged* position, which shows that the Knight was a Crusader ; but the right arm brought down athwart the breast, with the hand grasping the handle of the sword, is plain enough ; the favourite, if not universal mode, of representing those Knights who took up the Cross to fight against the Saracens in the Holy Land. The lithograph is from a drawing by Mr. Ramsden. Coming to the wall dividing the nave from the chancel, we perceive here the usual opening, in this case on the south side, through which access was obtained to the Rood loft. From its excessive rude ness and misshapen condition, it is tolerably clear that its sides have been robbed of their freestone jambs. Some broken stones projecting from the wall here and there, indicate the existence of the stair case, by which the doorway was reached, and through which the priest stepped out to the Rood loft to read the Epistle and Gospel. Oftentimes this staircase was a winding one, in the thickness of the wall. Such a one may still be seen in Ystradvellte Church, Brecknock. It is not at all unlikely that the niche in which the effigy above mentioned lies, has been * Some, however, are of the opinion that this position does not invariably indicate that the person was a Crusader.

At one time there was quite a rage for knocking off pieces of freestone from church doorways and carved stone work, which were used to make grit to put on the wooden riffs which are employed in these parts by the farmers for sharpening their scythes. The entrance into the chancel is wide and lofty, and the arch pointed, something like that at Cheriton, but without the stone dressings and other elegan cies of art observable there. I observed some stencil marks in black, on the champfers, but could not quite make them out ; stencillings were apparent on the blank spaces north and south of the arch, but I failed to make anything of them, as the whitewash adhered so closely to the paint that in taking off the former the pattern of the wall painting was destroyed. Entering the chancel we come upon several monuments of the most interesting kind ; amongst them the tombs (floor crosses) of probably three former priors of the Priory of Llangenydd. There is no inscription now legible, if indeed there ever was any, the only epigraphic distinctions that remain to be seen are the crosses, as shown in the illustra tions, which are faithfully done, and represent the originals perfectly. None of these are likely to be older than A.D. 1400, and may be of any date from 1104 up to that time. But far earlier than these, and without doubt the most ancient and interesting relic in this church is the stone, with interlaced work (on one side only) in the centre of the chancel floor, of which the hthograph is a facsimile, taken from a rubbing. This stone probably marks the site"], [493, "An-ci.\u00bb\u00bbi-t Floor Crowes, in Ch-aivcet of \\J,a-n.aenrv\\*lW CK-\u00ab.rclv."], [494, ""], [495, ""], [496, "Ancient sl-<m*,iv tfcjt uttcHuecti uwrfc.,tnClvan.c\u00abt q^ LJ-a^w*- n/iutU Ctvw.reK."], [497, "85 of S. Cennydd's grave, for here, in his church of Gowerland, as Wm. of Worcestre informs us, the holy man, to whom Llangennydd owes its name and fame, was buried. The record is as follows : \u2014 \"Translaeio Sancti Kenneth, heremit\u0153, die 3o post nati vitatem Sancti Johannes Baptist\u00e6, jacet apud ecclesiam vill\u00e6 Sancti Keneth in Gowerland,\" vid. Wm. of Worcestre, Itin, p. 116. In English the foregoing may be read thus : \u2014 The translation (i.e. the death) of S. Keneth the Hermit, took place on the 3rd day after the Nativity of S. John the Baptist ; he lies buried in his church of the town of S. Keneth in Gowerland. It seems, however, from what Wm. of Worcestre tells us, that S. Cennydd's relics were not suffered to remain here, but were removed, together with those of SS. David and Thebaus,* to North Wales. \" Sanctus Davidicus de eeclesia Mene vensi Sanctus Thebaus de Llandaff sepultus. Sanctus Keneth de villa Keneth in Gowerland, Isti tres sancti et non plures sunt translati in North Wallia.\" The stone in question measures in length 4 feet, *n width 2ft. 2in., but there is a little taper in it, as may be gathered from the drawing. The interlaced work on this stone at once points it out to be a relic of great antiquity ; but not earlier than the eighth or ninth, and not later than the twelfth centuries. Whitaker thinks that crosses with scroll work are always antecedent to the Conquest, that is, to A.D. 1066. * A misprint for Telaus\u2014 i.e., St. Xeilo."], [498, "86 The late Mr. Gilbert French, of Bolton, who has written a most valuable treatise on the interwoven stone work of ancient times, proves with as much ingenuity as ability, that this form of ornament originated in the earlier wicker work, for which the ancient Britons were so famous ; and that all the various and endless forms of interlaced work to be seen on crosses and early Christian gravestones, are nothing more nor less than imitations in stone of earlier models in wicker work ; and he argues his theory so perfectly and in such a practical way, that the conclusion is irresistible. The east window of this church is of the decorated style of the fourteenth century, but has no label. There is a similarity between this window and the beautiful west window of Caldicot Church, Mon mouthshire, figured in Freeman's work on Window Tracery, p. 274. The top light varies in form to the other two in the Llangenydd window ; at Caldicot they are the same. On the south side of the chancel there are two windows (lancet couplets), one, ogee, fohated, the other plain. These windows had been blocked up for many years, but on the Restoration of the Church in 1884 they were re-opened, repaired, and glazed. I should here mention that at this time the ancient monuments spoken of above, that is to say, the floor crosses and the stone with interlaced work, were removed from their original position ; the former were placed at the lower end of the nave, and the latter against the wall dividing the nave from the chancel."], [499, "Wuidour uiSaittK si\u00abe oj Nairft, Ucirt-^tn-KK. kj\\ C-Vtv**ck .

The foregoing extract from the old Register book of Nicolaston parish, establishes the date of his death to have been in 1698. He was probably succeeded by the Rev. Richard Portrey, A.M., Inst. 1st of November, 1664, vid. Dio. Records. He was also Rector of Rhosilly, and Vicar of Ystradgunlais, Brecknockshire. He died in 1714, and was buried in the chancel of Llan genydd Church, where a mural tablet to his memory may still be seen. The name of the Rev. David Pruddero, A.B., appears as Vicar, A.D. 1710, and is placed at the foot of an old parish lerrier of that year ; he was also Vicar of Pennard, and manied Rachel, daughter of Rowland Dawkins, of Kilvrough, Esq., vid.

Richard Williams, who was also Vicar of Pennard, took place in 1849 ; he was succeeded by the Rev. Samuel Phillips, appointed in 1849 ; he was followed by Rev. John Lloyd, appointed in 1852, who after wards became Rector of Oxwich and Nicolaston, and Vicar of Penrice ; he was succeeded by the Rev. J. Ponsonby Lucas, M.A., the present Vicar, also Rector of Rhosili, appointed in 1855. In the year 1877, the Rev. J. Ponsonby Lucas, the present Vicar of Llangenydd, recovered in a somewhat singular way, a small endowment belong ing to this benefice, consisting of 27a. lr. 33p. of land, the rent of which he had not received for twenty years, during which he had held the incum bency. Being at the Castle Hotel, Llandovery, in the year above mentioned, he took up a book, which turned out to be Lewis' Topographical Dictionary of Wales ; a work of immense labour, and remarkable for the general accuracy of its statements concerning the various parishes in the Principality. Turning to Llangenydd he there found the following state ment concerning its church : \" This church was"], [512, "94 endowed with \u00a3400 Royal Bounty.\" He imme diately wrote to the Bounty Office in London, on this subject, and received a letter from the Governors giving every information concerning the endowment. He then learnt that two grants of \u00a3200 each were made in the years 1776 and 1792, respectively, for the augmentation of the Benefice of Llangenydd. The first of which sums was expended in the year 1777, in the purchase of 27a. lr. 33p. being part of a tenement of land called Cwm Eynon, in the parish of Llangendeirne, Carmarthenshire. The remaining \u00a3200, not being invested in land, was properly secured, and the interest \u00a36 1 Os. paid annually to the Vicar of Llangenydd. With a sum of \u00a3400 they purchased in 1777 the remaining portion of the same tenement, for the augmentation of the Vicarage of Pennard. Upon the death (in 1849) ofthe Rev. Richard Williams, Vicar of Llangennith and Pennard, the Rev. David Jones, Prebendary of St. David's and Rural Dean of West Gower, became Rector of Bishopston and Vicar of Pennard, and who from the time of his succeeding to these two benefices, and up to the year 1877, continued to receive the whole rent of the farm of Cwm Eynon, being totally ignorant of the fact that any portion of it was appropriated to the augmentation of the Vicarage of Llangenydd. The matter was submitted to arbi tration, and as it was found that Mr. Lucas could not legally claim more than the last six years' arrears, Mr. Jones refunded the rent to that amount. The following is a transcript of the conveyance"], [513, "95 of that part of the farm of Cwm Eynon, purchased for \u00a3200, and given for the augmentation of the Vicarage of Llangenydd.

HISTORY OF THE ALIENATION OF THE RECTORIAL TITHES OF LLANGENNITH, WITH A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE TERMS RECTOR AND VICAR From the early part of the twelfth century, the time when the church was erected by Roger de Bellomonte, the great tithes (probably alienated by him) were annually paid over to the Abbot and Convent of St. Taurinus, of the town of Evreux, in Normandy, and who consequently became the Rec tors, and it appears the patrons also of the church of Llangennith, and the living became a Vicarage^ and has remained so ever since. When the Alien Priory of Llangennith was dissolved by Henry V., A.D. 1414, the King would be the Rector, and when it was granted by his suc cessor Henry VI. to Henry Chicheley, Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop was the Rector ; he however granted the tithes and other emoluments"], [521, "103 to the Warden and Fellows of All Soul's College, Oxford, and they consequently became the Rectors, and remained so until the year 1838, when an ex change was made between them and the late Major Penrice, of Cilvrough, Gower, for the great tithes of the parish of Newton Bromswold, Northampton, upon his decease, his nephew, Thomas Penrice, Esq., who succeeded to the Gower Estates, became lay rector of Llangennith and patron of the living. It will also be clearly seen from the perusal of the interesting documents on pp. 38, 39, that the Prior ofthe Priory of Llangennith, and the Incumbent of the Parish Church, were two distinct persons ; for there we learn, that when the Priory was vacant by the death of Richard de Fonte, in A.D. 1400, letters were directed by Guy Bishop of St. David's, to Richard Phillip, then Vicar of Llangennith, and others, both clerical and lay, to hold a commission of inquiry, as to the fact and circumstances of the vacancy, and divers other matters and particulars, and to make a due report to the Bishop. The Vicar, in Latin Vicarius, is defined by Burns in his work on Ecclesiastical law, to be one that hath a spiritual promotion or living under the parson, and is so denominated as officiating vice ejus, in his stead as it were, and such a promotion is called a Vicarage. The title is not a modern one as some perhaps may think, but very ancient and in the old documents above alluded to, it will there be learnt, that in the year A.D. 1400, and of course long before, the incumbent of this parish was styled a Vicar, and"], [522, "104 we may learn further from the same source, the names of other Incumbents, both Rectors and Vicars, of certain parishes in Gower at that time. There is a house in the village still called the Vicarage, where doubtless in days gone by the Vicar lived ; there is a tolerably large garden attached to it, but the dwelling house is of a small and humble character. From the above it will be seen, that a Vicarage is a living where the great tithes are received by some one, other than the actual incumbent. In the present instance the income of the Vicar, which is very small, is derived from part of the rent of a farm called Cwm Eynon, in the parish of Llan gendeirne, and \u00a36 10s. annually from Queen Anne's Bounty, and a tithe rent charge of \u00a365 9s. The lay tithes are commuted at \u00a3155 17s. THE MAPSANT. S. Cennydd's Day, alias the Mapsant, is kept in this parish on the 5th of July. This was the great est and most popular of all the Gower Mapsants, and people were in the habit of coming from the distant town of Swansea to join in the festivities usual on these commemorations, which consisted of fiddling, dancing, ball playing, and various other amusements. Great quantities of what is called in Gower, \" Flour meat,\" otherwise \" White pot,\" a mixture of flour and milk boiled together, were con sumed on these occasions ; and this was one of the peculiarities of the Llangenydd Mapsant, just as the pie of chopped mutton and currants, was, and still"], [523, "105 is, of that at Llanmadoc. An old man told me that fifty years ago, he remembered standings of ginger bread all the way from the church gate to David Nicholas' house. On these occasions it was always the custom to run up a pole and a wooden cock, dressed with ribbons, on the church tower, and that when the Vicar in later years would not allow this to be done, the inhabitants fixed it in an old chestnut tree that formerly grew in the church yard. In the West gable of the tower there is still to be seen two projecting stones, with holes, perforated through them, for holding the pole ; they were carefully replaced in their old position when the tower was restored in 1882. As Llangenydd is the only place in Gower where this particular custom was observed, it must have had some local signification, and it is not at all unlikely that the origin of this curious ceremonial may be found in that part of the legen daiy life of S. Cennydd, when as an infant, floating about in his cradle on the sea, like Moses on the river Nile, he was rescued by the wild sea birds, who, it is said bore him up with their beaks and talons, and conveyed him to the island of \" Henis Weryn\" (Worm's Head). The cock was therefore hoisted up, as in some sort showing forth this memo rable event in the life of the Saint, when the birds of the air so wonderfully interposed on his behalf. The cock in Church symbolism signifies watchfulness, and for this reason is not unfrequently seen sur mounting weather vanes on church towers ; but it could scarcely have been so used and intended in this case, as it was only set up once a year, and only P"], [524, "106 on S. Cennydd's day. The other feature of this mapsant \u2014 the \" White pot,\" or \" Milked meat,\" as it is sometimes called\u2014 may be an allusion to another remarkable incident in the infantile life of the Saint, when as Capgrave informs us, a hind from an adjoining wood came and supplied him every day with milk from her udder, while he was lying in the comfortable nest that the birds had made for him in a hollow of the cliff. This mapsant lasted three days, and the second was considered the principal day. A very curious old custom used to be observed on the 4 th July in this village, and at Llandimor, in the parish of Cheriton, of making a large bonfire on the evening of that day on the village green. The practice has now quite died out, yet there are a few old people still living who remember the fact per fectly well. It was the remains of a very ancient superstition which has come down to us from pagan times, of lighting fires in honour of the sun, and is doubtless of common origin with the Beltan fires of other parts of Wales, and practised in Scotland and Ireland. THE TERRIER* OF THE PARISH OF LLANGENITH. A terrier of all and singular the houses, buildings, tythes, dues, and profits whatsoever of and belonging to the Vicarage of Llangenith, in the County of Glamorgan, and Diocese of St. David's, made the 20th day of December, in the year of our Lord 1720.

Unless there is some typographical mistake I am quite unable to explain this difference, but it is cer tainly so in my copy of the Valor. In the return of poor livings qualified for aug mentation under Queen Anne's Bounty Llangennith is valued at \u00a315 a year. By an Act of Parliament passed in A.D. 1704 in the reign of Queen Anne, all livings under \u00a350 a year were discharged from the payment of first fruits and tenths to the Crown ; hence the meaning of a discharged Vicarage or Rectory. \"\"By the Act above mentioned, the Crown relinquished for ever this ancient revenue, and restored it to the Church, not however by remitting it entirely, but in a spirit of the truest equity, by applying the first fruits and tenths arising out of the larger benefices to make up a fund for the augmentation of the smaller. This was clone in the case of Llangennith and Pennard, as already noticed elsewhere in the pages of this work. There were proceedings in Chancery in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, relating to the Rectories of Llangennith and Pennard, held for a term of years under All Souls' College, Oxford, but I have not been able to get an account of the nature of the dispute. With regard to the sum of six shillings and eight pence to be distributed every year, among the poor of the parish, it will be seen by referring to the grant of the Priory of Llangennith to All Souls' * Vid. an account of Queen Anne's Bounty, by Hodgson, 2nd Ed., AD. 1845, p. 5"], [531, "113 College, by Henry VI., that this was in accordance with a clause in that deed, which orders a certain sum fixed by the discretion of the Bishop to be so distributed.

TRANSLATION.] CONVEYANCE OF LAND IN LLANGENNITH. Harleian Charters. 75. c. 28. Deed undated. Know all present and to come, that I, John * Indistinct in the original. V"], [532, "114 Laheles, son of ... . Laheles, have sold and granted, and by this my present writing have con firmed to Robert de Penris, and his heirs, for forty marks of silver, which he has paid to my hands, All my land in the fee of Langennith, which I and my ancestors by hereditary right, held of Robert de la Mare and his ancestors, with all the appurtenances and liberties pertaining to the aforesaid land, and just as any land can be freely given or sold, save the annual rent which I and my ancestors were accus tomed to pay to the aforesaid Robert de la Mare and his ancestors, that is to say, two shillings and eight pence at Easter, and two shillings and eight pence at the Feast of Saint Michael. And moreover, to me, and my heirs, the said Robert de Penris shall pay yearly at the feast of St. Michael. But I have sold the said land to the said Robert, so that he may give, sell, exchange, or mort gage, or devise by will, the same lands, with all its appurtenaces, to whom or to whomsoever he will' successively, for ever, save the aforesaid rent. And that this my sale may be preserved, ratified, and inviolate for ever, I have affixed my seal to the present writing. These being witnesses, Sir William Gabriel, then Prior of Langenuth, Sir Henry de Vilers, John de Bukeham, then Steward of Gower, Hugh Purkis, Henry Mansel, Richard Barri and others. The authorities at the Record Office think that the probable date of this deed is Richard I, or John ; if this opinion is correct, it must range from A.D."], [533, "115 1189 to 1216; that is, the date must he between those two periods. The fact that it is undated shows that it is a document of great antiquity, and strengthens the probability that such an opinion may be correct. But I am not without hopes of being able to fix the time pretty nearly when I have more closely examined the various unpublished documents among my papers ; the names mentioned in the deed itself will assist me in this, and I shall probably allude to it again in some future number of my history of West Gower. We have here several well-known names, of cer tain of the old Gower families, of Norman extraction, such as Penrice, de la Mer, and Mansel. But apart from this, there is a peculiar interest belonging to this ancient document, inasmuch as it is the deed of one John Laheles. The name is an historical one, and it is that of a man who in his day, was a very celebrated character. Lales or Lalys, was the name of the architect brought over from Palestine by King Henry I., and who was employed by him to build many castles in this country, he is also said to have planned Neath Abbey. It is thought he finally settled at Laleston, in this county, and that the place got its name from him, and was called Laleston, i.e., the town of Lales, ever after. The name is so strange and uncommon, that oc curring as it does in the above document, at such an early period, and from the allusion made to other Lales, ancestors of the John Lales or Laheles, who made the conveyance, it is by no means unlikely that this man was a lineal descendant of the cele- Q 2"], [534, "116 brated Lales of Henry the First's time. The name of Barri, one of the witnesses, possesses a very special interest as connected with the history of Llangennith parish, not only because it is a name of note, but because I think it can be associated with the name of a certain tenement of land, where there is at present a substantial farm honse, called Barry son, more correctly Barry 's-town, the letter (t) being dropped ; there is little doubt that this place was so called after some person of note of that name in former days, perhaps after the very Bam who signed this deed, or some immediate ancestor of his. POPULATION. From an old survey made in A.D. 1563, by Dr. Richard Davies, Bishop of St. David's, we learn that in that year, the number of households in Llangen ydd Parish amounted to 67. Giving an average of five persons to each house, the Population in 1563 would be - - - 335 In 1811 the population was - - - 36-4 \u201e 1833 - - 367 \u201e 1861 --------- 384 \u201e 1871 360 \u201e 1881 292 Area of the Parish, 3479 acres. Some few years ago, an old MS. commonplace book of one Mr. Leyshon Rogers, of Llangennith, came into my hands ; it was commenced in 1784, and as it contains some very interesting information as to the scale of labourers' and artisans' wages one"], [535, "117 hundred years ago, the price of cattle and game at that time, together with a great variety of other matter, I have made a few extracts, and give them without any alteration, just as they appear in this curious old book, which begins with an account of a very severe frost in 1784. \"January the 1 7th, 1784, the great frost and snow began, and held till February the 21st, which is 5 weeks before it came to change, there was some snow till the 5th of March before it went clear off.\" \" The frost began the 7th day of December in the year 1784, came to rain the third day of Febru ary in the year 1785. Saturday the 18th day of December in the year 1784 was the most dangerous time that was ever remembered in any age by any person that is living, some horses lost their lives, the turnpike roads was all in a plate of ice.\" He then speaks of a great drought following this hard frost. \" From the 18th day of February 1785 there was no rain of any value till the 1st day of June, that was three months and most three weeks, and after that it was very dry, till the beginning of Septem ber, and then there was so much rain that the late corn was all most lost, that the corn groud fast to the ground, and some was carried off the ground that could not be bound.\" \" January the 6th in the year 1786 there was so much water upon the face of the ground as was ever seen by any age now living. Coome Kiln was every bit under water, that it ran along the road towards Burry.\""], [536, "118 Labourers' wages were very low in Gower at that time, as we learn from the same authority, that the \" Customary price for making hay is 2d. and 3d. a day in 1787.\" Masons were paid Is. a day, but upon their own meat Is. 6d. ; Joiners were paid 8d. a day, and Coopers 1 Od. He also informs us of a custom prevalent at that time about grinding corn. \" A farmer may give a miller 1 5s. a year, and have it ground towll free, and to have it weighed in and out, only to allow one pound for waste.\" Alluding to the practice of cock fighting, which was very prevalent at that time, and long after, he says, \" John Bevan had for the cock fight the gun that Leyshon Rogers had.\" After this there is an entry relating to the pur chase of some property by Mr. Lucas. \" Mr. Lucas bought July 6th, 1776 the two farms, Hardins down, and the farm at Llangennith of Mr. Bennet Dosset for \u00a3505. The farm at Hardins down was 24 acres, and that at Llangennith 13 acres.\" Elsewhere he informs us, that \" Mr. Richard Gordon was high sherif for this county in 1775.\" This however is a mistake on the part of Mr. Rogers, for Mr. Gordon was High Sheriff in 1770, and this fact is so stated on a mural tablet to his memory in Llangenydd Church, and also in the list of Sheriffs given by Dr. Thomas Nicholas in his book of the history and antiquities of Glamorganshire. Amongst a variety of memoranda, there is one respecting witches, and headed as follows : \u2014 \" For the art of unwiiching, or unlucky people, the fable I heard, so that I ivrote \""], [537, "119 \" If you think that you have any thing that is witched take some may Tree, and beat what ever cattle or any thing that you think is witched all over first, and boil some of the may tree in milk, then give two hornfulls for some few days, till the witch comes to say God bless them.\" \" If a witch be coming to the door, take a birch broom, and put a cross in the door, then the witch cannot come into the house till the broom be tuk out of the door.\" In another place he speaks of a certain toll, called \" Toll Pixey.\" \" The toll pixey that Mr. Powell do use, is 4d. per \u00a3 for every pound's wort of the crop that is took.\" And elsewhere, \" There is 4d. due for the toll pixsey for every pounds worth of tithe that is Rented out of the Colledge hoult.\" I was for many years trying to find out the origin and meaning of this tribute called the \" Toll Pixy,\" and at last was fortunate to come across it in the survey of Gower, taken in 1764, for the Duchess of Beaufort, by Gabriel Powell, Esq., Steward of the Seigniory of Gower. The \" Toll Pixy \" is there ex plained to be an ancient tribute, due to the Duke of Beaufort, and collected by his steward. \"Toll Pixie.\" \u2014 \"There is also within the said Seigniory a customary yearly payment of fifty shil lings, called Toll Pixie, that is to say, one pound six shillings and eight pence on the Western side of Pennard's Pill, to be rated on all Artificers, Handy Craftsmen, Buyers and Sellers, within the several Parishes of Penmaen, Nicholaston, Penrice, Oxwich, Porteynon, Knelston, Landewy, and Llangeneth,"], [538, "120 and within the Hamlet of Pilton otherwise Pilton Green. And one pound three shillings and four pence on the Eastern side of Pennard's Pill, to be rated on all Artificers Handicraftsmen Buyers and Sellers within the Parishes of Oystermouth, Penard, liston, and that part of the Hamlet of Nicolaston called Manselfield. The manner of assessing this is to summon two persons out of each Parish or Ham let to meet at a particular place and day, when they make an assessment, or rate, on the persons liable proportionally not only of the sum to be paid the Lord, but as much more as will pay their expenses at the meeting to assess and for the collecting,\" vid. Gab. Powell's Survey of Gower and Kilvey, p. 26, folio MS. 1764, now in the possession of Mr. John Richardson Francis, of Swansea. A great portion of Mr. Rogers' book is filled up with various recipes for the ailments of cattle and horses, remedies and treatment for cuts, bruises, and complaints incidental to man or beast. At that time there was no medical man in Gower. The first resi dent medical practitioner was Mr. Daniel Davies, Surgeon, of Reynoldston, who died at a very ad vanced age a few years ago, and -who came into this district about the year 1816. The M.S. of Mr. Leyshon Rogers is in fact quite a repository of miscellaneous information, and in one part of it he has a rare collection of poetical com positions, suitable for Valentines, a few specimens of which will doubtless amuse some of my readers. \" You are the one and only one And I am only he,"], [539, "121 That doth love one and only one And you my dear is she. My dear and better pray read this letter, And on the writer some pity take, You may have richer but not have better, I could my dear die for your sake.

Streams of pleasure rivers of wine Plantations of tea and a young girl to my mind. Among some of the remarkable occurrences of his time, he speaks of many cattle that died in 1782 for want of food, fodder was so scarce that the thatch of the houses was given to the animals to eat. * \" Berly May the 4th, 1782 people are obliged to take the thatch from their houses to give their cattle for want of fodder.\" \"May the 13th, 1782, there was 54 Hides on a market Day, of cattle that died for want of fodder.\" We learn from the same authority that though wages and the price of meat was exceedingly low in his day, game was rather an expensive article. \" The first of the season the woodcocks is seven shilling and sixpence a brace. A Hare is one shilling and sixpence, and partridge is sixpence each. A wild duck is one shilling and three pence each, and teal ninepence each.\" * What this word Berly may mean I am unable to say. R"], [540, "122 It seems from an entry in this old book, that it was the custom to whitewash the church once a year. \" There is 7s. 6d. allowed by the parish for white washing the church every year and 2s. 6d. for white washing the chancel every year. There is ld. per load allowed by the parish for earring every load of lime into the church.

THE CAMP ON HARDING'S DOWN, Consists of several deep trenches, portions of the banks in some places are quite level with the ground and it is by no means in such a perfect state of pre servation as that on Llanmadoc Hill. But though the earthworks are somewhat similar, they do not assume quite such a circular appearance on Harding's Down as they do on Llanmadoc Hill. But the most curious feature in the shape of a military work on Harding's Down, is the small circular construction on its north side, and much below the true camp on the top, and totally distinct from it. From its peculiar position, and the way in which it is so completely commanded from the sum mit of the hill, it is difficult, almost impossible to suppose, that it was a military work at all. The late Violet le Due, the celebrated French architect, speaking of these curious circular struc tures met with in different places, believes them to"], [543, "125 be early amphitheatres, made for civil purposes, and for the sports and amusements of the people, the high bank thrown up all round, forming a seat for the spectators. This seems to me the most rational theory on the subject ; for as places of military strength or defence, these constructions, in such situations, could have been of very little use indeed. Moreover we have to remember, that the Ancient Britons and Danes, and all uncivilized nations, always had their camps on high grounds, such as the tops of hills, where nature herself helped to defend them. As the Roman camp was always square, or rather oblong, with rounded corners, it is certain that nei ther the camp on Harding's Down, nor that on Llanmadoc Hill, can be of Roman origin. And there is yet another reason, why neither of them could belong to that nation, namely, that the Romans never constructed their camps on the tops of hills, but almost invariably on gentle declivities, near the banks of rivers and streams ; they never looked to natural defences, but depended upon the discipline and strength of their legions. According to the story of the traditionary battle on Tankey Lake Moor, the two camps were antagonistic, and occupied at the same time by two hostile parties, and if so, there is little doubt that the engagement that took place was between Welshmen and Danes. *Cleypit, of Harding's Down.

Barker D R Rue This dispute as to the right of cutting turf on Rhosilly down is rather interesting, as carrying us back to a time when the use of coal was almost un known to the poorer classes ; indeed I can myself remember, when dried cowdung, and what were called \" scrallogs,\" i.e., half burnt stems of furze T 2"], [558, "140 bushes, constituted the only fuel made use of by numbers of the poorer families in Gower. This turf that was cut on Rhosilly Down, and also on Llanmadoc Hill, is not the genuine peat that is met with in Ireland and in some parts of Wales, but rather a thin paring of the surface of such parts of the hills and commons as contain a sufficient quantity of fibrous matter, which together with the aforesaid cowdung and scrallogs, afforded a very fair substitute for coal. THE PANCROSS. In writing the notices of this parish, nothing gave me more trouble than the finding out the origin of the Pancross. An old tradition prevails in the village, that it took its name from the circumstance of one of the wounded soldiers from the battle of Tanky Lake Moor, falling down, crying out, and ex piring on this spot, in great pain ; and that the place is really Pain Cross, and was so called ever after. I need scarcely say that this explanation seems so very strained and fanciful, that it can scarcely be accepted as correct ; moreover there is one fatal objection to this painful story, namely, that neither of the con tending parties in this ancient engagement, spoke English. Yet this legend, erroneous as it manifestly is, led me to think that the Pancross might have been the site of one of those old crosses called in Welsh, Maen Achwynfan (the stone of lamentation), at which it is said penances were finished, attended with weep ing, and the usual marks of contrition. Pennant,"], [559, "141 in his history of the parishes of Whitford and Holy well, Flintshire, p. 113, speaks of these crosses, and mentions an example of one near Stafford called the \" Weeping Cross,\" of elegant form and sculpture, 12 feet high, 2 feet 4 inches broad at the bottom, and 10 inches thick, the base being let into another stone. For a considerable time I flattered myself that I had found in this theory a satisfactory explanation of the origin of the Pancross, and that the curiously and fancifully jumbled up story of the \" Pain Cross \" above mentioned, might have some modicum of truth in it after all. But there was yet another idea, \u2014 that it might have been the Welsh Pen cross, \u2014 that is, the chief or principal cross, whether a stone cross, or a cross road, or possibly it might have had some connection with St. Pancras, and consequently nothing to do with any cross at all. These various suppositions were, however, all doomed to be upset ; and I had the good fortune to ascertain the true etymology of the Pancross from an old Latin charter of Sir Richard Scurlage, dated A.D. 1352, preserved at Penrice Castle, which with a few others, were placed in my hands to decipher, by the late Mrs. Traherne, of Coedriglan, Cardiff. This old charter was taken at random from a number of others, without any idea that it would prove of much use, or that I should find in it that particular information about the Pancross, that I had been trying so long to discover. About the middle of the paper, there appears this sentence, \" Juxta eru-"], [560, "142 cem palmarum de Langenyth \" (near the Palm Cross of Llangennith) Thus it turns out, that after all, the place is neither Pancross, Paincross, Pencross, nor St. Pancras, but the \" Palm Cross ;\" so true it is, that one fact is worth a bushel of theories. And yet I was very nearly missing this most interesting, and to me, invaluable piece of informa tion, from the fact that the word \" crucem \" was so obscurely abbreviated in the original, that I com pletely failed to make it out, and was on the point of giving it up and returning the document, when it occurred to me to make an exact transcript on tracing paper of this particular abbreviation, with the words immediately preceding and following it, and sendiftg the whole sentence to the Record Office in London ; more for the sake of the decipherment of the document, than from any idea that this par ticular sentence would be of use to me as throwing any light upon the Pancross ; for this word \" crucem\" which in its abbreviated form (\"c\"cem\") I could not make out, was in reality the key to the whole sentence. The tracing was submitted to Mr. Vincent, who at once deciphered it, and returned the passage cleared of its contractions, and written in full, \"juxta crucem palmarum de Langenyth,\" with this transla tion, \" by (or nigh to) the Palm Cross of Langenyth.' I leave my readers to imagine the infinite pleasure I derived from discovering, by a mere accident as it were, the true etymology of the Pancross of Llan gennith. There is no Cross of stone in this place at the present day, though certain old roads cross each"], [561, "143 other at this spot ; so that why it was called the Palm Cross, must still be a matter of conjecrtue, for the old document above mentioned gives us no information on this point. The old charter from which the true name was obtained, has a seal in red wax, with the arms of Scurlage in a heater shaped shield attached to it ; the inscription round the border of the shield is, \" Sigillum Ricardi Scurlag.\" As this ancient charter more especially appertains to my forthcoming notices ofthe parish of Llanddewi, and the history of Scurlage Castle, the seat of the Norman family of Scurlage, I must reserve the pub lication of its contents until those notices are in the press. RAVEN'S WELL. Remarkable for its singular name and copious flow of water, which is the same winter and summer. Not far from the well stands a small thatched house, called the Vicarage ; the stream which issues from the well runs close to this house and is crossed by a rude stone bridge. Below the Vicarage is \" Coity Green,\" where there are a few old houses, now unin habited, but which seems to have been a place of some note in former days. \" Coity Green is a name that has been made the subject of a little discussion, and has given rise to some rather fanciful etymologies. It has been connected with Cetti, an old Welsh chieftain, also with the event known as the raising the stone of Cetti, mentioned in the Triads, and supposed to be the huge Dolmen, called \" Arthur's Stone,\" on Cefn"], [562, "144 Bryn. It has also been thought that there might be some analogy between \" Coity Green\" in Gower, and the dolmen known as \" Kits Cotty house,\" in Kent ; and that Sketty, near Swansea, is only another form of the same word. A little knowledge of the Welsh language is sufficient to remove every difficulty surrounding the name of \" Coity Green.\" \" Coity\" is simply a cor ruption of Coed-ty, i.e., the wooden house, or the house in or near the wood. The word \"green\" speaks for itself; a greener spot could scarcely be found. With regard to the name of the well above men tioned, it is so unusual, and has so much of the Danish sound about it, that when we compare it with similar names of places in Lincolnshire, such as Ravendale, Ravensfleet, Ravensleugh, and Ravens brook, all supposed to be of Danish origin ; and as we have in Gower, and along its coast, several dis tinctly Danish names, it is not at all unlikely that \" Raven's Well \" of Llangenydd, is another memorial of these sea king rovers. The raven (in Danish Hrafn) was not uncommon as a personal name. It is well known that the raven was a sacred bird among all northern nations, A black raven with open beak and extended wings, embroidered in the centre of a white silk banner, was the Danish war standard ; and so continued until a.d. 1219, when it was exchanged for the cross. It is not impossible, but highly probable, that such a banner was dis played and planted at this very well, when the Danish soldiers were burning and plundering the"], [563, ""], [564, "Oldt w\u00ablL in Llu-ixqtwiasvtk Vl<Uu.gc,rvccir tK\u00ab Church,."], [565, "145 church close by, in 986 ; hence the name given to the well ever since. THE VILLAGE WELL. The drawing made a few years ago of the old well in the centre of the village, shows its pic turesque appearance before it was arched over with its present covering of stone work. In consequence of an outbreak of typhoid fever, and the constant fouling of the water of this well by cattle, horses, ducks, and geese, which had access to it in its primi tive condition, led at last to the necessity of protec ting it in the manner at present adopted. But the most interesting feature about this old well is the capstone, covering its top, which has been there from time immemorial, and is still (1884) to be seen in its original position. It bears upon one end a rudely cut incised cross, lying within a square, formed by a roughly chiselled grove. The material is that known as old red sandstone conglomerate ; and as its ex cessive hardness renders it almost indestructible by the action of the weather, its time worn appearance from other causes, such as persons putting their hands upon it, resting their buckets, pails, &c, from generation to generation, in days gone by, shews that it must be a relic of great antiquity ; and from the character of the sculpture one might assign to it a period not earlier than the sixth, and not later than the eighth century. I think we may safely venture to assert, that this old stone is not in situ, but is clearly one of those early mortuary pillar stone crosses, erected to mark the last resting place of some u"], [566, "146 person of great note in former days, and was probably brought from the churchyard close by. Fancying that I should be sure to find a cross of similar design amongst the large collection of figured stone crosses in Westwood's Lapidarium Walli\u0153, or Hubner's Tiibcriptiones Britanni\u0153 Christiana, I searched both works carefully over, and to my great surprise I could not discover a single example, at all resembling the old cross on the old well of Llangen nith village. A plain cross within a square, equally plain, does not occur among any of the numerous illustrations of those publications, and they contain drawings of every known relic of this description, save the one at Llangennith, which has never been figured before, and which, strange to say, never appears to have been observed by any of the inhabi tants, until I happened to notice it one day when drinking out of the old well. One must have an eye for these things, as they sometimes turn up in the most unlikely places, and are occasionally un observed by those who have them continually before their eyes. BLUE POOL BAY AND THE THREE CHIMNIES This bay derives its name from a circular pool, about 15 feet in diameter, but now of no great depth, formed by nature in the rocks, and just about high water mark, so that the sea washes into it during spring tides. Twenty years ago its depth was about 1 5 feet, and it was supposed to be unfathomable ; it is now quite shallow, and nearly filled up with sand, which has drifted into this bay very much of late."], [567, "147 About half way between Blue Pool and the Arch, or as it is sometimes called, the \" Three Chim- nies,\" a remarkable discovery of gold doubloons and moidores was made by John Richard and Honora his wife, about 100 years ago. They had been drawing for fish, with the net used for that purpose in these parts, and were resting on the rocks after their work, when the old man observed some glittering yellow substance in a crevice of the rock on which they were sitting ; his curiosity being excited, he picked it out, and discovered it to be a large piece of gold ; both then proceeded to search the place more closely, and it is said that these two people found at that time a large number of these coins. Whether any were met with by other parties I have not been able to learn ; but the fact seems to have been well known ; and about forty years ago, two men, Thomas Hullin and William Taylor, went with their quarry- men's bills purposely to search this spot, to see if they could find any, and strange to say, they had not been long at work before they came upon several more of these coins sticking in the crevices of the rocks, and as bright as the day they came out of the mint. After a while others joined them, and the rocks were blasted with gunpowder, and it is said some few were found in this way. But at this point of the proceedings, the Lord of the Manor (the late Major Penrice, of Cilvrough) interfered and stopped them, and I have never heard that any were found since. The \"Arch\" which forms the western horn of this small bay, is a vast natural opening in the rock, u 2"], [568, "148 made by the action of the sea. It is by far the grandest thing of the kind on the Gower coast, and is well worth visiting, but little known. In the roof are three perforations, hence the name of the \" Three Chimnies,\" by which it is sometimes called. The rocks which form the inner part of this sandy cove, used to be frequented by a small colony of red legged crows, the heraldic bird known as the chough ; but of late years they seem to have abandoned the place, as none have been seen here for some time. A good deal of samphire grows on the cliffs hereabouts, and on those of the Burry Holms, close by, but it is never gathered by the people, who do not appear to know its value. This plant, though always affecting such situations, is never known to grow except out of reach of the actual wash of the sea. A very interesting story is told in connection with this circumstance, showing how important is the acquisition of every species of knowledge, and how valuable it may one day prove. A ship having been wrecked in the year 1821 , in the Enghsh chan nel off Beachy Head ; four only of her crew escaped alive ; thrown upon the cliffs by the violence of the waves, in the midst of a dark and tempestuous night, the shipwrecked men clung for safety to one of those eminences forming the promontory, and in a state of agonising suspense, waited there for the morning's dawn. At every instant however the waters ad vanced, threatening to overwhelm the httle spot upon which the mariners had gathered, till they deemed themselves painfully certain, that when the tide should have gained its height, they must inevi-"], [569, "149 tably be washed off their place of refuge. The storm dashed the spray against the rocks, their voices were lost amid the roaring of the wind, and even had the sailors of any vessel near been aware of their situa tion, no help could have been rendered. In the midst of this scene, the distressed men endeavoured to devise some means of escape. No other plan seemed to offer but that of casting themselves upon that sea, with the faint hope that they might be thrown on the shore by the waves ; any way they could but die. At this dreadful crisis one of the men unable to stand against the storm, clung to a weed on the rock, which a momentary flash of light ning enabled him to discover was a sprig of samphire. Happily he knew that samphire never fixes its root upon land which the ocean rolls over, and re-assured by this circumstance, they determined to wait on the rock until daylight, when they were observed from the shore and released from their perilous situation. This story is told in an old publication called the \"Penny Magazine,\" for 1838. This plant is called by the Welsh Bar a can y defaid, and sampier-y-ddafad, and is supposed to possess almost miraculous properties for feeding cattle. A very sad event occurred in this bay some years ago. A very promising young lad, son of the Rev. Prosser Pearce, Rector of Llanmadoc, accompanied by some other boys from the village, had been bathing ; after dressing themselves they went to look for gulls eggs, which abound here in the early Summer months ; unfortunately he went too near"], [570, "150 the edge of the cliff, and losing his hold, fell over and was killed ; the tide being quite in at the time, his body was carried out to sea and never recovered. On the West side of the Arch, and quite close to it, there is a cave called the \" Culver hole.\" The entrance is by a kind of fissure or slit in the rock, and just above high water mark. Looking up to it from below, no one would ever imagine that any cave existed here, but on creeping through the narrow opening, a very extensive cavern presents itself; being quite dark it is necessary to take lights to explore ; it appears to have been inhabited at some remote period, for on my first entering it many years agi, I found portions of a human cranium, near a large boulder, which looked as if it had dropped from the roof. In the year 1883, in company with Major Miers, 79th (Cameron Highlanders), and his nephew, I again explored this cave, when we found other portions of the same skull, and nearly the whole of the upper and lower jaw, mixed with bones of cattle and sheep and a quantity of wrood ashes, looking very much like as if an act of cannibalism had taken place. The teeth were sound and good, not much worn, and appeared as if they belonged to a person in the prime of life. It was in this cave that the last cargo of smug gled brandy ran on the Gower coast, was intended to have been stowed ; the attempt however was un successful, and the whole was seized by the Custom House officers."], [571, "151 THE HUSK OR HESK. The name given to a high bank adjoining Llan gennydd Burrows, and not far from Broughton Farm. On the summit of the mound there is a large stone about 10 feet long by two feet thick, of a square form, which has evidently been thrown down, and as a quantity of small stones amongst which it lies indicate the remains of a cairn, it would appear that this place is really the grave of some person of great note in olden times, and it is very likely the mound is partly artificial. Curiously enough there is a rather long note on the meaning of the word Hesk, in Hearnes' Glossary on Robert of Gloucester's Saxon Chronicle. He there gives two explanations as to its meaning. (1st) That it is equivalent to the Saxon word Hext, sive Hexte, i.e., highest or chief; and says that the word is found in the village named Hexton, in Hert fordshire, which in the Doomsday book was written Heyckstantune (i.e., high stone town). (2nd) He thinks that it may be the Welsh word Hesg, signi fying reeds, or rushes. Such plants are to be found in and about this place still, and might have been more plentiful formerly than now. As Welsh names of places abound here, as well as elsewhere in Gower, I think the latter is more likely to be the true mean ing of Husk, as given to this bank ; it is now quite overgrown with scrubby bushes, and is quite a brake of brambles and thorns : at least such was its state when I visited it some years ago. In a field adjoining the Husk, there is a Maen hir (long stone) which has been partially overturned ;"], [572, "152 the height is about 8ft. 4in, thickness about 18 inches ; it broadens in the middle as shown in the drawing. The field in which it stands is appropriately called \" Long stone ; \" a name frequently met with in Gower, as given to fields, which still retain the name, although the stone has long since disappeared. In the course of my perambulations through the district of Gower, I have frequently come across stones of this description, that have been wilfully thrown down ; in some cases they interfered with the tillage of the land, and the farmers broke them up and removed them ; they must have once been exceedingly numerous. THE TEMPLE. Not far from the Husk, and close to an old lane, leading to Llangenydd Village, are remains of a small rectangular building, called \" The Temple,\" measuring internally 24ft. by 19ft. ; some portions of the walling about 4ft. high, and thick, are still to be seen. From the nature of the mortar, which is very good, and similar to what the Gower people call \" castle work,\" it is probable that this was one of those Chapels-of-Ease, erected by the piety of wealthy persons in pre-reformation times, for the convenience of those who lived at a distance from the Mother Church. As the Knights Templars possessed property in the neighbourhood, it is not unlikely that this was some cell of theirs. Many of their buildings upon the dissolution of the order, became private dwelling houses, and were frequently called \" Temples.\""], [573, "Pitched Stoat,. Loncjston.e. FUlcL, Lla,ncftnrurtk"], [574, ""], [575, "153 Whether the temple of Llangenydd is to be numbered among the extinct churches of this parish, I will not undertake to say ; but of the existence of small churches at Penmynydd, near Kenigstone ; on the Burry Holms, and at Burry, near Llandewi, there can be no doubt whatever. Of that at Penmynydd, the place where it once stood, still goes by the name of the \" Church yard ; \" and it is writhin living memory, that the remains of the old foundations were grubbed up and used in repairing the fences, and building the farm house called \" Stormy Castle, ' close by. This was a Chapel-of-Ease to the Mother Church, and very convenient it must have been for the old and infirm living near, who found the distance to the Parish Church too great for failing health and feeble limbs. There was always some small endow ment given by those who erected them, for the repair of these buildings, and the sustenance of the priest. These endowments were seized by Edward the VI. , and as there was then nothing left to maintain the services or repair the fabric, of course the churches soon fell into decay and became extinct. This is in fact the simple cause of the extinction of these small churches, as will more fully appear in the history of the \" Libera Capella\" (free chapel) of Henllys, in Llandewy, in my forthcoming notices of that parish. John Grove, farmer, of Penmynydd, told me that he had found in one of the hedges of the churchyard field what he called a stone boot jack, and from his description it must have very much resembled that article ; it has however been lost, so that it is im possible to say what it might have been ; it was V"], [576, "154 probably something belonging to the old church. Two oblong freestone slabs, now forming the steps to the door of the house on Stormy Castle farm came in all probability from the same place. A small portion of land about here was once the freehold property of a rather extraordinary and eccentric old man, who went by the nickname of \" Lord North,\" and lived at the farm called Muzzard, in this paiish ; once when corn was three pounds a bushel, he was heard to say, \" that this was fair play between man and man.\" His wife was called the \" Old Lady,\" and lived to a great age ; when one hundred years old she could see to thread her needle without glasses. THE CHURCH ON BURRY HOLMS. The remains of buildings still to be seen on this island convey the idea that there must have been a small conventual establishment here, while the re remains of a boundary wall seem to indicate the existence of a former churchyard. There is a tradi tion preserved in the neighbourhood, that people from Penbrey, in Carmarthenshire, used in ancient times to attend service at the Burry Holms Church, on Sundays, and crossed the river at Whitford on stepping stones. The date of the decay of this church would be contemporaneous with that of Kenigstone, above mentioned, and must be attribu. ted to the same cause. The ruins now form a very useful landmark for vessels approaching the Burry Bar and bound for Llanelly, and are well known to mariners frequenting that port."], [577, "155 William of Worcester, writing in A.D. 1478, has the following notice of this island, in his \" Itinerary\" : * \" Insula vocata anglice le Holm in Gowerland jacet inter Swaynesey villam ex parte occidentali de Gowerland, ultra Sweynsey et Kedwelley villam in le northside Swayusey et villam Seynt Davyes in' parte occidentali per 40 miliaria et continet dimidiam miliaris in longitudine, et in latitudine quasi 1 quart, miliaris, et mare sabrinum circumdat dictam insulam.\" The above, rendered into English, may be read as follows : \u2014 \"The island called in English the Holm, in Gower land, in the west part of Gowerland, beyond Swansea, lies between Swansea town and Kidwelly town, Swransea on the northside, and the town of St. David's on the west, forty miles off, and is half a mile long, and about a quarter of a mile broad, and the Severn sea surrounds the said island.\" It is very remarkable that in the foregoing description of the Burry Holms, which as to its dimensions and geographical position is accurate enough, no mention is made of any buildings on the island, which would hardly have been omitted if any existed there in 1478, the time when Wm. of Wor cester wrote his Itinerary. This being so, we may venture to conclude, though perhaps with no positive certainty, that the ruins we now see are the remains of buildings erected after that time. The people hereabout, when speaking of this place, almost invariably call it the Holms Island. Vid. Itin. Willelmi de Worcestre, p. 117, Nasmyth's Ed. pub. 1778. v 2"], [578, "156 There is a curious tautology here, for in point of fact Holm is the Danish word, meaning an island. But this is only one of many instances where wre find some foreign word, and its English equivalent, em ployed in the designation of some particular locality. I should mention that Wm. of Worcester, on page 155 of his Itinerary, speaks of another \"In sula de Holmys ; \" but although he describes it as near the Worm's Head, he has so confounded his geography, that it is evident he intends to describe one of those places known as the Holms, near Car diff, and not the Burry Holms in Gower. It is mentioned in the Survey of Gower, made by Gabriel Powell, Esq., in 1764, as one of the scattered parcels which belonged to the Manor of East Town, alias Prior's Town, Llangennith. \" N.B. There are some other Parcels scattered, be longing to this Lordship (viz) an Island in the Sea, called the Holms, bearing due North from Worms head.\" Before taking our leave of this wind swept, storm beaten island, we must not forget to notice the deep ditch cut across it, from North to South. There is very little doubt that this was made by the Danes, during one of their many hostile invasions on this part of the Gower Coast. But as I have already alluded to it in the earlier pages of this work, it is unnecessary to say any thing further on the subject here."], [579, ""], [580, "Rhosilly old Church, previous to Restoration."], [581, "157 RHOS-SILI. Lewis in his Topographical Dictionary of Wales says, that this parish took its name from Reginald Silly, Sully, or Selwy, to whom the lordship was given in the division of the conquered territory of Glamorgan by Fitz-Hamon. The learned editor of that work may be relied upon for the general accuracy of his statements, but in this instance I think he is mistaken. Rhosilly is a purely Welsh name, and means the moorland,\"\" near the sea. In the old register book of the parish of Llanmadoc, it is written Rhos Hilly, and in an inquisitio post mortem of the * * year of Edward II. , it is written Rosulby. Such variations of the name are, of course, merely phonetic, and do not affect the question ; but Rhosilly from Reginald di Sully, Sili, or Sulwy, seems a very strained derivation, and could only be received on the very best evidence, and I have not as yet met with the name of this Norman Knight in connection with Rhosilly in any of the old papers or records that I have hitherto got together, bearing upon the history of West Gower. I should be very glad to know if Reginald de Sully had anything to do with the lordship of Rhosilly, for the information is quite new to me. Gower was not conquered by Fitz-Hamon at all, but by Henry de Newburgh, Earl of Warwick, A.D. car. 1099. There was not much difference in point of time between the conquest of Glamorgan by Fitz-Hamon, and that of Gower by the Earl of Warwick. Historians differ as to the exact year, but all agree that both * From Rhos, a moor and heli brine, literally the briny moorland."], [582, "158 the events took place towards the close of the eleventh century. Reginald de Sully was one of the twelve Norman Knights who accompanied Fitz- Hamon, and received as a reward for his services the lordship of Sully, a parish about seven miles from Cardiff (hence his surname of de Sully) quite a distinct place from Rhosilly in Gower. THE CHURCH. Like its sister church at Llangennith, this of Rhosilly has much to interest us as we trace back its history through the middle ages, to almost prehistoric times. It first comes before us as founded by S. Fili in the 6th Century. Iolo Morganwg thus notices it, \" Fili, the son of Cenydd, the son of Aur, of Coed Aur, his church is Rhos Fili, in Gower, vid. Iolo MSS., p. 507. Again in the same work, among the genealogies of the Welsh Saints, S. Fili's pedigree is thus given, St. Fili, the son* of Cennydd, the son of Gildas, in Gower, vid. p. 540. Rees in his lives of the Welsh Saints, makes the following statement : \u2014 \" Fili, the son of Cennydd ap Gildas, Coed Aur, a saint, to whom it is said the Church of Rhos Fili, in Gower, now known by the name of Rhos-sili, is dedicated ;\" but he elsewhere in his work, quoting Brown Willis, says, that this church is under the dedication of S. Mary. The reference to Rhosilly in the Parochiale Anglicanum of Brown Willis, published in the early part of the * i.e. his spiritual father. This expression often occurs in the lives of the saints, and is to be thus understood."], [583, "159 last century, is as follows : \u2014 \" Rossilly R. St. Mary Patron, the * Crown.\" The more ancient dedication was doubtless to S. Fili. If Brown Willis is correct, the alteration to that of S. Mary, was probably made when the present structure was erected, in the 12th or 1 3th Century. Like many of the other Gower Churches, this of Rhosilly belonged, in ancient times, to the quasi religious order of the Knight Hospitallers, of St. John of Jerusalem, and was given to them in the early part of the 13th Century, by William de Turberville. The grant is thus noticed in the Confirmation of Bishop Anselm, A.D. 1230. \"Ex dono Willie de Turberville Eecliam de Llanrhidian, cum capella sua Vill\u00e6 Walter, et eecliam de Landunner, et eecliam de Rossili ;\" that is, William de Turberville, gave the Church of Llanrhidian, with its chapel of Walterstone, and the Church of Llandimore, and the Church of Rhosilly. This document, called the \" Confirmation of Bishop Anselm \" (Bp. of S. David's), is of considerable length, and relates chiefly to grants made to the Commandery of the Knight's Hospitallers at Slebech, in Pembrokeshire. About 60 years after this, we meet with a very particular notice of this church in the Taxatio Ecclesiastica of Pope Nicholas IV., A.D., 1291. \" Deeanatus de Geory.\" \u00a3 s. d. 4 6 8.\" \" Ecclia de Ressely * The Patron is now the Lord Chancellor."], [584, "160 In the Valor Ecclesiasticus of Henry VIII., A.D., cir. 1536, it is mentioned as follows, the name of the then Rector being also given : \u2014 ROSEHYLLY.

Besides its great antiquity there are several interesting features belonging to this church ; especially to be noted are the fine Norman doorway, a font of that period, an ankret's window, and an ancient bell. With regard to the doorway, the lithograph, executed from a very carefully-made drawing, will convey a better idea of its architectural details than any written description. In or about the year 1856, the church, which had got in a very dilapidated condition, was restored by the joint liberality of C. R. Mansel Talbot, Esq., M.P., of Margam Park, and Mrs. Treharne, of Coedriglan. Like all the other old churches, this had its Rood Loft, long since destroyed, and its entrance in the wall dividing the Nave from the Chancel, has been walled up."], [585, "NorraO-rv cloorwc-t), RHosili.

Under these conditions the Llanelly tide table gives the following directions : \" Good anchorage may be found near the Wormshead, Rhosilly Church bearing SE by E, in seven fathoms at low water, in a good sandy bottom, and perfect shelter from southerly and easterly winds. It should be noted that the saddle-back roof of the tower runs north and south, like that of Llandewi, but has no parapet. One of the bells is particularly interesting, and has been the subject of a great deal of discussion. The inscription is, \" ora pro nobis sancte tellant ;\" as yet no one has met with the name of this saint spelt in the way it appears on this bell, nor indeed in any way resembling it. Several letters about it, written by different persons, may be seen in the publication called \" Notes and Queries.\" There is a local tradition that two bells were taken from a Spanish vessel wrecked in the bay many years ago, and placed in the church tower, where for many hundred years they were sounded by striking with hammers, by which the one in question was cracked, within the memory of an old carpenter, 90 years of age, who thereupon assisted in hanging the other, lest it should share the same fate. I took a rubbing of the inscription when the church was being restored, and remembered at that time reading the name of vv"], [590, "162 the saint as Tennant, not Tellant, but as the rubbing is now lost I should not like to speak positively on the point, further examination of the bell itself would clear this up. Percy Enderbie in his Cambria Triumphans, p. 130, A.D. 1661, speaks of a church in Colchester called St. Tenants, as an old church decayed, in his time. On referring to the clergy list, I find there is no church under this invocation at the present day. The earliest kind of inscription on Church bells was simply the name of the saint to whom the bell was dedicated, as sea : Maria ; sc : Luce, &c. In the 15th Century, we find \"ora pro nobis \" added, vid. : a very interesting article on church bells in the \"Church Builder\" for July, 1867, p. 133. If the writer (J. H. S.) of this article is correct the Rhosilly bell cannot be older than the 15th Century. He further states, that up to the 16th Century the inscriptions were in Latin ; previous to that time inscriptions in English were very rare, and that after A.D. 1660, all interest in bell inscription ceases. In connection with the history of this church, we must not forget to mention the Mapsant. which was really the feast of its dedication. It was, and is still kept on the 1 2th of February ; the religious part of the Festival has long been lost sight of, but the merry-making was retained, and until late years, used to be continued for three days. In the nature of the festivities, every Gower Mapsant was alike, this at Rhosilly was however celebrated for what was called Bonny Clobby \u2014 a kind of plum pudding that was prepared, sold, and largely consumed on these"], [591, ""], [592, "Aikrets -j-.nclo-i..

In Archdeacon Nare's Glossary, \" Bonny Clobby,\" there called \" Bonny Clabber,\" is given as an Irish term for sour buttermilk, quite a different sort of thing from what is understood by this name at Rhosilly. REDDITUS RESOLUTUS. There is a Rent resolute and Royal pension of 2si a year due to the Crown from the Rectory of Rhosilly. This Royalty, due from certain churches in Gower, was purchased from the Crown by Major Penrice, of Cillvrough. The origin of this payment may be found in my notices of Cheriton parish p. 108. THE LEPER'S WINDOW. The Rev. John Mason Neale, observed several of these windows in churches in Denmark, some of them were blocked up, some not, they are generally found on the south side of the chancel, near the ground, but also in porches, often with a wide splay on the inside, and consequently having a broad seat in the thickness of the wall. In the church at Odense, Isle of Fyen, he describes a most unusual form of this kind of window, splayed on the outside contrary to the general rule. He remarks that with one exception, he had never seen them in connection with anything that bore the appearance of an Altar. He states that from all he could learn about them in that country, he believes they were used for the purpose of hearing confessions. He adds that the narrowness of the aperture in many cases was too small to allow the passage of a hand, and that the communicating of lepers through these windows w 2"], [594, "164 would be almost impossible. Vid. Ecclesiologist, No. xci., August, 1852, p. 215. Dr. Neale is however mistaken in this latter point, as these windows were certainly used for the purpose of hearing confession, as well as for com municating lepers, as will be presently seen. In Dr. Rock's Church of our Fathers, the object of these low side windows is thoroughly explained. He proves by abundant evidence that they served several purposes. They were constructed originally for the use of Anchorites, a class of religious persons who devoted their lives to the service of God, and lived a life of perpetual retirement within the building, where they had vowed to live and die ; there the Anchorite dwelt, either in a room above the vestry, or in a chamber over the porch, or perhaps in one of the lofts of the church tower. Through these windows he heard confessions, communicated lepers> received his food and fuel, and occasional preached sermons. One of the old paintings lately uncovered in Eton College Chapel, shews a bishop administering the blessed sacrament through a low window. At Ellsfield, Oxford, a seat and small stone reading desk, are contrived inside, on the window cill (figured in the Arch\u00e6ological Journal, IV., 316), so that the ankret might give his instructions and exhortations sitting. In Stow's Chron. : p. 459, it is stated that Richard the II. before he went to meet Wat. Tyler> in Smithfield, went to Westminster Abbey, then to the Church, and so to the high Altar, where he devoutedly prayed and offered. After which he spake with the Anchore, to whom he confessed"], [595, "165 himself. In Bibery Church, Gloucester, there is a narrow low window, called to this day the \" leper's window,\" (Notes and Queries, ii. iii.) Martene instances a window through which the Holy Com munion used to be given to a leprous nun : \u2014 \" Devenue lepreus elle (Sainte Adelaide) fut separee selon la consume, et on voit encore la fenetre par laquelle elle venoit recevoir la communion (voy : Litt : de deux Benedic. 1 pt. 2, p. 205).\" \"She, that is to say, St. Aleide, having become leprous was separated, according to custom, and she might be seen at the window through which she received the Communion.\" Leprosy was a very common disease in the middle ages. During the restoration of Cheriton Church, Gower, in 1874, a chimney flue was met with in the tower, where probably the ankret had his dwelling. These ankrets were some times studious people, and were celebrated for their devotional writings, and many of them copied out, and illuminated church service books. The ankret, however, did not always live beneath the church roof ; his ankrage or house, in which he was solemnly shut up, often stood quite apart by itself, either at the further end of the church yard, on a bridge, by the way side, in a lonely wood, and always had its little chapel. There is, as Dr. Rock states, architectural evidence that some one must have slept in the church, since the mode of fastening the door was often by means of a bar of wood, which had to be drawn out of a long narrow hole made in the wall, and into which it could be slid back again, only by someone inside"], [596, "166 the church. Such a hole is still to be seen in the parish church of Mai'gam, Glamorganshire ; whoever so shut the door and opened it again, must of necessity stayed in the church all night. Bromton speaks of the hostium ecclesi\u0153 immani obice clausum (Ed. Twysden, 1, 941). Roger of .\\ endover, in his Flowers of History, speaks of St. Wulfric, a priest, and ankret, who immured in a cell, used to preach through his low side window to the people. It is observable, as Dr. Rock says, that this low side window is nearly always on the south side of the church, the most frequented part of the church yard, to avoid the suspicion of its being used for improper purposes ; it was thus in the sight of every body, and all who resorted to it could be seen ; it is so in the case before us. Perhaps there is scarcely any subject in Ecclesiology which has been the cause of so much discussion as the origin and use of these low side windows, called, but improperly, Lychnoscopes. A great many letters and papers on this subject may be found in the Ecclesiologist for the years 1846, 1847, 1848, 1850, 1852, 1858 and 1865. In reading over the various articles in that publication bearing upon this point, there appears to be a very scant notice in some, and an utter absence in others of any reference to ancient authorities on the use of these windows, while the greater number of the writers seems to have quite lost sight of the Ritual of the Church in prereformation times, a knowledge of which would have materially helped to clear away the mystery which has surrounded these openings for so long a"], [597, "167 period. The fact is, as Dr. Rock most clearly shows, that these windows have their history and use, as plainly set forth as anything well can be, and are frequently alluded to in ancient writings. The term Lychnoscope (light squint), sometimes applied to these low side windows, is a misnomer, and as Dr. Hook, in his Church Dictionary, says, is now generally abandoned. Dr. Rock never uses it. As openings for light, or for the purpose of seeing the Altar, or indeed anything else in the Church, they were perfectly useless. There is historical evidence to show that these Ankret's windows were walled up in Henry VIIIth time, for in a letter from Thomas Bedyll to Thomas Cromwell, referring to the blocking up of these windows, he says, \"We think it best, that the place where the *frires have been wont to thire outward confessions of all commers, at certain tymes of the yere, be walled up, and that the use be foredoen for ever.\" This communication by Mr. E. J. Carlos, on the use of the so-called Lychnoscopes, was addressed to the Gentleman's Magazine, for October, 1846. This recommendation, Mr. Carlos observes, applied only to Monasteries, but he adds, \" if an irregular practice of this kind existed in parochial churches, and there were places requiring to be walled up, it would be within the province of the ordinary to direct it to be done. It was not within the line of Bedyll's duty to notice such places, though the notoriety given to the practice by the visitation of the monasteries, would necessarily produce a similar t hear. \u00bb Friars."], [598, "168 order from the ordinary to close them when found in parish churches.\" Vid also the Ecclesiologist for Feb., 1847. This letter of Thomas Bedyll maybe found printed by the Camden Society, in their publication entitled, \" Three Chapters of letters relating to the suppression of Monasteries,\" edited by Thomas Wright. BESANDED CHURCH. Remains of an old besanded church may be seen in the warren belonginging to Pthosilly Glebe ; the site of this ruin lies about midway between the Parsonage House and the present Parish Church. A FEW CURIOUS EXTRACTS FROM THE OLD REGISTER OF RHOSILY PARISH. Ob negatam 3s. 8d. Recordandi Pensionem omissum tie pro annis 1668 & 1669 Registrum scias. From this rather curious entry we may learn that a fee of \"\"3s. 8d. was paid to the Incumbent of Rhosilly every year, for keeping the Register Books of the Parish ; that is, for entering all baptism, marriages and burials ; and that there were no entries made for the years 1668 and 1669, because the fee of 3s. 8d. was refused. The above Latin memorandum may be translated thus \u2014 Here you may know that the fee of Registration 3s. 8d. being refused the Register was omitted for the years 1668 and 1669. * In the old Terrier of 1720 the fee is stated to have been three shillings and four pence."], [599, "169 The following somewhat curious entry appears in the year 1689 : \u2014 \" Joseplius f. Gulielmi Richard (sua se manu occisus scilicet Cultello Tonsorio jugulum secatus) Julii Decimo nono.\" That is in English, Joseph son of William Richard, killed himself with his own hand, that is to say, he cut his throat with a razor, July 19. In the year 1807 the following entry appears \u2014 \"June 15th Thomas Day. a Guernsey man died of a broken leg being cut off.\" THE TERRIER OF RHOSILLY PARISH.

He had several children, but could not obtain any allowance out of his living to support them, so that he was forced to turn farmer for some time, and afterwards went to Ireland, but lived to return, was restored to his place, and at length made Archdeacon of Llandaff and Rector of Chayley, and died, if I mistake not, in the year 1686.\" Richard Portrey, M.A., Inst.

Records state that he was instituted Oct. 19th, 1771. It appears that he was non-resident owing to the unfitness of the Parsonage House. In an old number of The Cambrian Newspaper, published at Swansea, January lt>th, 1806, we meet with the following notice respecting him : \u2014 Rev. Dr. Hall, of Llandaff, gave thirty Bibles to be distributed among the poor inhabitants of Rhosilly, of which place he is Rector.\" He was grandfather of the late Sir Benjamin Hall, Bart., afterwards Lord Lanover. The name of Hugh Williams appears as Rector in 1820, non resident owing to the unfitness of the Parsonage House. He was succeeded by John Lloyd, afterwards Rector of Oxwich and Nicolaston. It was during his Incumbency that the Church was restored and a new Parsonage House built. He was succeeded by J. Ponsonby Lucas, M.A., Instituted Feb., 1855. By the kindness of Mr. Jos.

W. Watson. THE SWINE HOUSE. There can be little doubt from the name given to this Dolmen, that it is the grave of some great chief of those Danish invaders who in former times, sorely"], [633, "Overthrown. Dolmen, on Rhofi It Down.,"], [634, ""], [635, "Dolmen Ci*tLei< tiw Swtni? Hou.sw , RhoitU DctvrV."], [636, ""], [637, "199 harassed the peninsula of Gower, and left many traces of their presence and stay in the district. Having dwelt somewhat at length on this subject in the first part of my Hist, of West Gower, it only remains to explain the meaning of the word \" House \" in this case. I think that in the present instance, the word \" How,\" not house, is intended ; how is an old English word, meaning a mound, i.e., a sepulchral mound ; \" Swene \" is Sweyn ; a truly Norse name, doubtless that of the hero who was buried here. Hence \" Swine house \" is in reality Sweyn How, i.e., Sweyn's mound, or Sweyn's grave, or as we would say in the common language of the day, the last home, house, or abode of Sweyn. The word \" Low,\" frequently met with in compo site words, in different parts of England, has the same meaning, and is equivalent to Cairn, Barrow, and tumulus ; and was understood and used in this sense by I. Leland, the antiquary, in Hen. VIII time, as the following example will show. \" Hubbelow tumulus in Devonia, ubi Hubo inter fectus sepultus fuit ;\" that is Hubbelow, a tumulus in Devonshire, where Hubo being killed was buried. Vid- Leiand's Coll, vol. 4, p. 44, Hearne's Ed. I should mention, that \" How \" appears in the Danish word \" Haugr \" (a sepulchral mound). From the presence of a quantity of small stones round this Dolmen, it would appear that it was originally covered with a cairn, as indeed was invariably the case. There are two of these Dolmens, within a few yards of each other, one has been thrown down, but both go by the name of the \" Swine House.\""], [638, "200 Some years ago in rambling along the top of Rhosilly Down, I came across a grave of a rather unusual type. It was formed of a number of small flat stones placed on their edges and rudely coffin shaped, something like what one sees on the tops of the graves in a Gower church yard at the present day ; it was open, and had it not been in such a wild and unfrequented place, one might have thought that this was a modern, rather than an ancient grave ; *t was certainly very unlike the usual type of Cist vaen, and evidently constructed to receive the body at full length. I have tried to find this curious grave since, but without success. I am not certain whether there was any appearance of a cairn. The late Sir Gardner Wilkinson, then staying at Rhosilly Parsonage, spent several days exploring the numerous cairns on this down, but I do not know whether he met with this particular grave ; I think it is very likely he did. I should mention that the \" Swine House \" is situated on the north side of the Down, and it is certainly a circumstance to be noticed, that with very few exceptions, the cairns, cistvaens and dol mens on Rhosilly Down, Llanmadoc Hill, and Cefn Bryn, are either on the ridge or on the north sides ; very few are found on the southern sides. There must have been some meaning in this. Such an arrangement could scarcely have been accidental. It would almost appear as if the people of those days were as particular in placing their graves to face the north, as we are in placing ours to face the east. In the case of those Danish warriors, whose remains"], [639, "201 were interi'ed in Gower Land, it might have been, that they^were so placed, in order that their spirits, who were supposed to haunt the place of burial, might look towards the north, the beloved land of their birth. In Wors\u0153a's account of the Danes and Norwe gians, speaking of the graves of the North men, he says, \" In Scandinavia they are met with mostly on hills, and near firths, or sea coasts, whence there is an uninterrupted view of the sea. To the ancient Northman it was evidently an almost insufferable thought, to be buried in a remote corner, where nobody could see his grave. The greater chief a man was, the more did he desire that his barrow should be high and uninclosed, so that it might be visible to all who travelled by land or sea. There was also a belief that the spirit would at times arise to look upon the beloved sea.\" WORMS HEAD. In the rocky head land called the \" Great Orm's Head,\" in North Wales, we have precisely the same name as we find ascribed to this well known pro montory in Gower ; the only difference is, that in the former case, the name approaches the Danish tongue somewhat closer than it does here, both being derived from the Danish word orm, serpent ; Wurmshead, or Wormshead, being nothing more than the Saxonized form of the same word ; having had this name given it from its fanciful resemblance to a huge serpent crepieng out to sea. The serpent played an important part in the Scandinavian BB"], [640, "202 mythology ; and those who wish to know more \" about it may consult Mallet's Northern Anti quities,\" 1809. Mr. David Watkin Jones in a recent work, \" Hanes Morganwg,\" says, the Welsh name of the Wormshead is \" Pen-y-pyrod,\" that is, the end of the points, or the extreme points. It is mentioned by several ancient authors ; William of Worcester, A.D. 1478, thus speaks of it, \" Insula Wormyshede proxima Caldey in aqua Severn, distat a Caldey per 20 miliaria, et est in longitudine dimidium miliaris, et in latitudine jactum sagitt\u0153.\" That is Worms head island next Caldey in the Severn sea, distant from Caldey about 20 miles, and is in length about half a mile, and in breadth about a bow shot. Vid. Wm. of Worcester's Itinerary, Nasmyth's Ed. p. 155. This author is not quite correct in his measurements ; from the mainland to the outermost point of the head is rather more than a mile ; the isthmus by which it is joined to the shore is overflowed at half flood, so that the greater part of the promontory becomes an island, visitors should beware of this, otherwise they stand a chance of being kept prisoners for a considerable time. Leland writing in the 16th Cent, alludes to this promontory, and speaks of a wonderful \" Hole at the Poynt of Worme heade, but few dare enter it, and Men fable there that a Dore within the spatius Hole hathe be sene with great Nayles on it ; but that that is spoken of Waters there rennynge undar the Ground is more lykely \" He also mentions another very remarkable circumstance in connection with"], [641, "203 this place, that there is a subterranean passage between the Wormshead and Gwendraeth Vychan in the County of Caermarthen ; \" there is also a Hole by the Heade of VVendraith Vehan, where Men use to entre in, and there they say be spatins Waulks, and that thens gouithe one way under the Ground to Worme hedde, and another to Cair Keunen Castle.\" Vid. Leiand's Itinerary vol. 8. p. 119 Hearne's Ed. With regard to the Hole spoken of by Leland near the point of the Worm, there is certainly an opening, and I was told by Wm. Lewis, a Llanelly Pilot, that he had on one occasion, on a very fine day, rowed his boat into it, and that it opened into a very spacious cavern, which he described to be as large as a Church ; I need scarcely say that he saw no door with great \" Nayles.\" Leiand's statement as to the underground passage may be thought incredible, but we must not be too sure about that, as there are caves in different parts of the world with ramifications that have been traversed for thirty miles underground, and which have not as yet been fully explored. I cannot help thinking, that the place called \" Henis Weryn,\" in the Legendary life of S. Cennyd, given in the notices of Llangennith Parish, is intended for the Wormshead. Here we have two Welsh words, the first Henis, is evidently ynys, an island, but I will not undertake to say what Weryn may mean, it is probably as corruptly rendered as the first word, written Henis. The writer of the life in question could hardly have been acquainted bb 2"], [642, "204 with the Welsh tongue ; but whatever \" Henis Weryn\" may conjointly signify, its equivalent in Latin, as the writer states, was '\"'turbe. On sub mitting this Welsh word \" Henis Weryn \" to my friend the Revd. J. Owen Evans, Vicar of Towyn, who submitted it to his father, the Revd. J. Evans, Archdeacon of Merioneth, a well known Welsh scholar, and contributor to the Arch\u00e6ologia Cam brensis, I received the following communication. With 'regard to Ynys-werin ; ynys is of course, an island, werin (gwerin) = common people, mob. Insula turb\u00e6, Insula turbinis, is applicable to Bardsey, the Welsh name for which is Ynys Enlli (Ynlli), i.e., a race, swift current. Ainsworth gives turbo = a periwinkle. With regard to Pen-y pirod, he says, Pen is plain, viz. a head ; pirod, or pyrod, may be the plural, (od being the plural termination) of Beiri, hawk, Glede. Pair also means turbo, a whirlpool, cauldron, (as Pont y pair, near Bettws y coed). Od is the proper termination for plural animals ; Pen y pirod = pen y peirod, i.e. the falcons rock.\" I should mention that Worms head, and the Pavyland Cliffs, near by, used to be a very noted place, as the haunt of the Peregrine Falcon ; and some 20 or 30 years ago, a gentleman living in Gloucestershire, who followed the ancient sport of hawking, used to employ old Jeremiah Cox, one of Mr. Talbot's Keepers, to procure him annually a pair of these young birds, or their eggs ; this I think is a very good confirmation of the Archdeacon's etymology of Pen y pirod, * I. E. Turb\u00e6. the dipthong is often omitted in writing the genitive case of nouns ot\" the ist declension in old Latin."], [643, "205 given above; it will be seen that he does not give the same meaning to the name as Mr. Watkin Jones. I think there is sufficient internal evidence to be deduced from the Legendary account of S. Cennydd's life, to warrant the conjecture, that the rocky headland, now called the Wormshead, is the island of Weryn, there spoken of ; for in the earlier part of the life, it will be observed, that Gower, miss- written \" Soyer,\" is mentioned as the place where King Arthur held his Court, and where the infant Cennydd was bom. Some authors state, that Arthur did hold his court once, if not frequently, at Loughor, anciently called Aberlwychwr, in Gower ; next we have the name of the river, the Llwychwr, there called \" Lothur ;\" it is also particularly to be noticed, that the writer speaks of a smaller river, flowing into the larger river ; this is precisely so, for the smaller river Llyw, flows into the large river Llwychwr, and forms a junction with it near the parish church, at the present day, thus agreeing with the topography indicated by that part of the story which details the circumstances connected with S. Cennydd's birth and exposure. The statement of the child having been put into his cradle into the small river, which carried him out into the big river, which carried him out to sea, and finally landed him at \" Ennis Weryn,\" (Wormshead) is as accurate a description of the locality, and estuary of the Burry, as need be. Any one acquainted with the North West, and South West sides, of the Gower Coast, can perfectly well understand, how the"], [644, "206 Saint's cradle woidd naturally be drifted towards tbe Wormshead, just as the story tells us it was.* In Camden's Britannia the Wormshead and that wonderful \" Hole \" spoken of by Leland long before, are thus described.! \" I shall offer upon this occasion what I think may divert you. You know there is in this chanel a noted point of land between the Nash Point in this country, and that of St. Govens in Pembroke shire, called in the Maps and Charts, Wormshead point, for that it appears to the sailors like a worm creeping, with his head erect. From the mainland it stretches a mile or better into the sea, and at half flood, the isthmus which joins it to the shore, is overflown, so that it becomes then a small island. Toward the head itself, or that part which is farthest out in the sea, there is a small cleft or crevice in the ground, into which if you throw a handful of dust or sand, it will be blown back again into the air. But if you kneel or lie down, and lay your ears to it, you then hear distinctly the deep noise of a pro digious large bellows. The reason is obvious ; for the reciprocal motion of the sea, under the arch'd and rocky hollow of this headland, or promontory, makes an inspiration and expiration of the air, through the cleft, and that alternately; and con sequently the noise, as of a pair of bellows in motion. I have been twice there to observe it, and both times in the Summer season, and in very calm weather. But I do believe a stormy sea would give * It must however be noticed here, that the legendary of St. Cennydd was probably written several centuries after the event, and when the conditions of land and sea were much as we see them an the present lime. t Vid. Camden's Britannia, Gibson's Ed. A.D. 1722, p.p. 733, 734, voJ. ii"], [645, "207 not only the forementioned sound, but all the variety of other noises ascribed to \"\"Barry, especially if we a little indulge our fancy, as they that make such comparisons generally do. The same I doubt not happened in other places upon the sea shore, wherever a deep water and rocky concave with proper clefts for conveyance do concur. In Sicily especially, where are moreover fire and sulphur for the bellows to work upon, and chimnies in those Vulcanos to carry off the smoak. But now that this Wormshead should be the intended Isle of Barry may seem very uncouth. Here I consider that Burry is the most remarkable river (next that of Swansy) for trade, in all Gower ; and its Ostium is close by Wormshead, so that whoever sails to the North east of Wormshead, is said to sail for the river of Burry. Wormshead again is but a late name, but that of Burry immemorial. Now he that hath a mind to be critical, might infer, either that Wormshead was of old call'd the island of Burry, or at least, that before the name of Wormshead was in being, the report concerning these noises might run thus : that near Burry, or as you sail into Burry, there is an island where there in a cleft in the ground, to which if you lay your ear, you'll hear such and such noises. And Barry for Burry, is a easie mistake.\" In the year 1804 some persons started a lobster fishery here, the fact is mentioned in Ihe Cambrian Newspaper of September the 1st of that year. \"The Rhosilly lobster fishery commenced last week, * i.e., Barry is land near Cardiff, where it appears there is or was a similar hole."], [646, "208 of the state and progress of which we hope shortly to give account.\" Nov. 18th. 1840, The City of Bristol, steam packet, was wrecked in Rhosilly Bay ; twenty -four lives were lost. SMUGGLER'S CELLAR. In the steep side of the mountain, and within a few hundred yards of the back of Rhosilly Parson age, there is a clear and copious stream of water, which has its source a little higher up the mountain ; about half way between the source of the spring and the foot of the hill, the stream runs through a debris of stones of various sizes, which look as if there had been a land slip on a small scale ; the fact is, that these stones are the remains of cellar, constructed in smuggling times under the actual bed of the stream ; there was a slight jump in the side of the mountain, over which the stream fell in a short cascade, the smugglers taking advantage of this, with great ingenuity excavated a large under ground cellar, and when it was finished, led the stream over the top of it, and made the entrance, which was closed with a few large stones, immedi ately under the water fall. When they wished to enter, to fill the cave, or discharge its contents, they turned the stream to one side. This hiding place remained undiscovered till the smuggling days were over. Some years ago, after a long continuance of heavy rain, the structure was burst abroad by the force of the water, and the stones were carried a"], [647, "209 little way down the hill, and are still to be seen scattered about. Another noted place for stowing away smuggled goods, was the cave known by the name of \" Hounds Hole,\" many a time filled with kegs of brandy This cave situated in the cliffs under Pitton, is very difficult of access ; it is said that the custom house officers were frequently in the neighbourhood of this hole, but could never discover it ; the tracks of the horses used in conveying the kegs were traced to a certain field, some distance from the face of the cliff, after this the clue was completely lost. The year 1805 appears to have been rather a memorable one in the annals of smuggling in Gower, for on \" Feb. lsith of that year, Mr. George Beynon, officer of the customs, with the assistance of Lieutenant Lawyers, and the sea Fencibles, seized on Rhosilly Sands, 101 casks, containing about 8 gallons each of brandy, Geneva, rum, and wine, which had been landed by a smuggler. The whole was disposited in the custom house in this \u00b0town.\" Vid. Cambrian Newspaper for 1805. Again, June 3rd, 1805, 115 casks of spirits were seized by Mr. Beynon and lodged in the Custom House. THE HELWICKS. The name given to a very dangerous sandy shoal about 4 miles south of the Worm's head. At low water during extraordinary high spring tides, I have been told that pilots have been known to jump from * Swansea. cc"], [648, "210 a boat on these sands, and that some spots here and there have been seen almost dry. Perhaps there is no one better qualified to speak authoritatively on the names of places than the Revd. Isaac Taylor, M.A., Rector of Holy Trinity, Twickenham, who has made this subject his special study. He mentions the \" Hel wicks\" in his work entitled \"Words and places,\" 4th Ed. 1873, p. 117, and confidently states it to be one of those dis tinctly Danish or Norse names which were given by the sea King rovers who invaded our coasts, and over-ran the country in early times, and left many a Danish name behind them, as an evidence of their presence. If it were not for the weight of so great an authority as Mr. Taylor, I should have ventured to say that the name may be the Anglo Saxon Helewick, i.e., the covered up, or hidden town (i.e., covered or hidden by being swallowed up by the sea), the name being given to it from the nature of the visitation that overtook it ; and this agrees with a very ancient tradition current with respect to the \" Helwicks,\" that there was once a road along these sands, and that pieces of iron horse's shoes had been dredged up there. The word wick is both Saxon and Danish, in the former tongue it signifies a town, village, or salt spring ; in the latter a bay or creek ; the primary meaning in each case being, as Mr. Taylor says, a station. Hele is an old Anglo Saxon word still in use, and means to cover something up : to \" hely potatos\" is a very common expression in Gower, also \" to hely up the head ;\" i.e.. to cover it with a whittle or hankerchief."], [649, "211 On the 1st of October, 1846, the elder brethren of the Trinity Board placed a Hulk off the west end of the Helwick sands showing a bright revolving light ; the vessel is moored in 1 3 fathoms of water and consequently a great boon to mariners, warning them of the proximity of this dangerous shoal which had been from time to time the grave of many a fine ship. A very melancholy event, however, occurred in connection with the exhibition of this light for the first time in that year. A homeward bound ship, of large size, called I believe the \" Rothesay Castle,\" with many passengers, and a valuable msicellaneous cargo, mistook this new light for that of the Mumble's Head ; and the captain being ignorant of its erection, which had taken place in his absence from England, shaped his course accord ingly ; the crew of tl _e light ship observed the mistake made by the ill-fated vessel, a short time before she struck, and made every effort to warn those on board of her danger, but in vain, their signals were either not observed or misunderstood, and in a very few minutes the unfortunate ship was hopelessly engulphed in the terrible sands, and every one on board perished. Many valuable things, such as silks, and cases of jewellery were picked up along the coast, between the Worm's head and Oxwich point, and it is said that a few persons who were out early on the sands on the morning after the occurrence, profited considerably by the valuable wreckage washed ashore. I shall here take the opportunity of making a few remarks on the encroachments of the sea on the cc 2"], [650, "212 Gower Coast. Following the same line of argument already laid down in Part 2nd p.p. 52 and 53, the Helwick shoal is probably the remains of that ancient bulwark, which in former days kept back the sea from overflowing the flat lowlands, now called Mewslade and Rhosilly Bays. In the same way it is likely that the Mixen sands, off the Mumble Roads is a continuation of the same kind of defence, that once upon a time, prevented the sea from flowing into the Mumbles Bay, as it now does. All along this coast, we have the most positive evidence, in the shape of stumps of trees, still to be seen, that extensive woods once flourished, and filled its numerous bays ; the remains are to be met w ith from the high and low water mark ; as. far as the tide will allow us to go, we meet with the stumps of these trees. The question naturally arises, what kept the sea back then ? and the only answer to this is, that natural rampart of sand, heaped up in the way we see it at the present time and doing for the people in former days, what it is doing for us now. And here we are forcibly re minded of the words of the prophet Jeremiah, who in admiration of the wisdom of Almighty God hi piling up the grains of sand as a bulwark against the force of the sea, says, \" Fear ye not Me saith the Lord, will ye not tremble at my Presence, which have placed the .sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it, and though the waves thereof toss them selves, yet can they not prevail, though they roar, yet can they not pass over it ;\" cap. v. 22. A"], [651, "213 truly striking passage by way of illustrating what I have said on this part of the subject. There is also every reason to believe, that the people in former days, were not ignorant of the advantage of embankments and sea walls ; and that such were employed, where the natural barriers did not exist we have positive proof, in the discovery of an old sea wall, at Port Talbot, in the year 1840. The following interesting extract is from a very scarce work, entitled, \" Contributions towards a history of Swansea, by L. W. Dillwyn, Esq., F.R.S.\" 1840, March 12 th, Mr. Dillwyn says, \" I received the following statement with this date, from my friend, C. R. M. Talbot, Esq., M.P.\" \" Yesterday I found at the Harbour (Port Talbot), about 25 feet below high water mark, a brass spear head, about nine inches long, many stags antlers, a large brass coin of Commodus, several pair of old fashioned leathern shoes, foundations of buildings, foot marks of deer and oxen, and old ences in a state of carbonization have been found near the same place, at various depths, from five to twenty feet below the present high water level ; also an ancient sea wall, having behind it, well marked indications of cultivations by ridge and furrow, which could not keep out the present high water by several feet.\" Mention is made of sea walls in the Welsh triads ; the inundati in of the Cantred y Gwaelod (Cardigan bay), is ascribed to the drunken carelessness of Seithenyn, son of Seithyn Savdi, King of Dyved, who let in the sea, and whereby sixteen towns were destroyed ; and that this was in"], [652, "214 the time of Emrys Wledig. Mr. E. Davies in his \" Mythology and Rites of the Druids,\" alludes to this event, but thinks it is not true, but only a perverted memorial of the deluge ; but the existence of certain stone embankments, visible at low water, for a considerable distance, seem to prove the correctness of the statement made in the triads, vid- Cambro Brit. vol. 1, p. 362. Of course it would be a most interesting, if we could know with certainty, when the different bays along the Gower coast were inundated by the sea. History records several great encroachments, among the earliest, is one, that is mentioned in the Saxon Chronicle, and is said to have taken place in A.D. 1099, the year when Gower was conquered by Henry de N ewburgh, Earl of Warwick. Sir Charles Lyell, in his principles of Geology, thinks it likelyj that the sea overflowed the site of the Goodwin sands at that time ; they were certainly overflowed before the 1 6th cent. , for Shakespear speaks of them as a dangerous flat, and fatal, where the carcases of many a tall ship lie buried. It was about the end of the reign of William Rufus, or the beginning of that of Henry I, that a great part of Flanders was overwhelmed by the sea, which inundation was the cause of so many Flemings coming over from that country, and settling in England and Wales. About the year 1532, that is, the 23rd year of the reign of Henry the VIII, an Act of Parliament was passed, bearing upon certain injuries done by the \" outragious course and rage of the sea, in and upon marshes and other low places.\" We may"], [653, "215 conclude from this, that about the beginning of the 16th cent., for doubtless the damage was done before the remedy was applied, the sea was again forcing its way inland, on some marshes and low places, in the County of Glamorgan. Again in the first year of Queen Mary 1553, another Act was passed, citing the former act, and giving additional powers to the Commissioners of Sew^ers, to look after sea walls, \" fludegates,\" &c, and to do what they could to remedy the mischief done by the sea, and to arrest the drifting of the sands, which latter was now beginning to do much harm by blowing in over the cultivated lands. To prevent this, land lords were accustomed to insert clauses in their leases, compelling the leaseholder to devote one or more days in the course of every year, to planting sedge in the burrows. Another very serious invasion of the sea is recorded in the Harlein Miss, as having taken place in A.D. 1607, temp. Jas. I, Swansea Laugharne and Llanstephen and divers other places in Glamorgan shire, are said to have suffered seriously. Vid. West Gower part II. p. 132. It is very difficult, perhaps almost impossible to say with certainty, when each of the many different bays along the Gower coast were surmerged ; but there is every reason to believe, from the case of Broughton bay, submerged almost within living memory, that some places remained intact longer than others ; and that in all probability, the wind blowing away the high tops of the sand hills, and scooping out as it often does, deep hollows through"], [654, "216 them, made large openings here and there, through which the tide eventually poured in, thus consum mating the disaster for which the wind had paved the way. It is well to remember in dwelling upon this subject, that the wind, rather than the sea, was, and is still, the chief factor in these maritime invasions. The dollars found in Rhosilly bay in the year 1833, bear the date of 1625 and some 1639, the wreck of the ship that carried them must therefore have taken place after that date, and had con sequently nothing whatever to do with the Spanish Armada, the date on the coins settles this point completely. I have hitherto met with no record of the actual year when she came ashore ; but if this was one of the vessels which local tradition reports was bringing over the dowry (\u00a3300,000 sterling) of Catherine of Braganza, who was married to Charles II in or about the year 1661, the wreck might have taken place between 1639 and 1661 or soon after this latter year. One thing however is quite certain, that from the place where the dollars were found, the conditions of land and sea in Rhosilly bay two hundred years ago, must have been just the same as they are now. But I think we may safely go a great deal further back than this, for if we keep in mind the terrible invasion of the sea in 1607, and the time it must have taken to form such an accumulation of sand as we find in Rhosilly and Llangennydd burrows, we may safely venture to say that the tide regularly ebbed aud flowed in this bay long before then, and if the Helwick ridge was"], [655, "217 submerged in the great inundation of 1099, perhaps from that time. There is historical evidence to show, that in the year 1478, when Wm. of Worcester wrote his Itinerary, the Burry Holms was an island, and is described by him as surrounded by the Severn sea ; vid. the account of this place in my notices of Llangennydd Parish. And as the Burry Holms is one of the horns of Rhosilly bay, it is perfectly certain that the conditions of land and sea in Rhosilly bay were the same in 1478 as they are at the present day. This statement of Wm. of Worcester is a most important one, and as an historical fact, helps us very considerably in tracing back the encroachments of the sea in this parti cular locality, and strengthens the probability that the encroachment hereabouts, was much earlier than that. If there was any means of fixing the date of the ditch cut across the Burry Holms, and doubtless of Danish origin, it would carry us back to a very early period indeed. The statement in the appendix to the Brut-y-Tysilio, of the landing of the Danes on the Gower coast, and the burning by them, of the Monastery and Church of St. Cennydd, in the year 986, might lead us to infer, that the Burry Holms was an island even in those early days, and consequently, that the overflowing of the low lying land of Rhosilly bay was an accomplished fact so far back as the ninth century. But these terrible warriors, undismayed by many reverses, kept on coming until after the conquest of England by the Normans, and it was not until several years DD"], [656, "218 after that event, that they finally ceased their incursions. These Danish ditches, alias Dane's dikes, can't be earlier than the eighth century, about the time when the Danes first made their appear ance, or later than the eleventh, when they ceased to be a source of any serious annoyance and dread to Welsh or English. The subject is one of very great interest, and requires careful study. Without theorizing very much, I have endeavoured to keep to a line of reasoning which appears to be the only one open to us in investigating a matter of this kind, namely, the evidence supplied by the Danish dikes cut across promontories \u2014 a sure indication of the proxi mity of the sea or navigable rivers \u2014 a few dates and historical statements, the evidence to be derived from decayed vegetable matter, and the trunks and roots of trees imbedded in the sand, and local traditions. Yet it must not be inferred from what I have said on this subject, that all the bays on the Gower coast were invaded by the sea at the same time ; their turn came, but some were spared longer than others ; and of all of them Broughton bay was the last to be devoured ; and with regard to this, there is the most positive evidence that it could not have taken place much more than a hundred years ago."], [657, "219 THE DOLLAR SHIP. The late Mr. George Holland, of Cwm Ivy, who died in the year 1862 at the advanced age of 86, told me, that when a boy, he remembered an old carpenter, who used to work in his employ, telling him that \" there was plenty of money on Rhos-sili sands only dig for it.\" The fact that a Spanish vessel with money on board, had been wrecked in Rhos-sili bay, was well known to the inhabitants, and one day in the year 1833, four men, Thos. Hullin, Wm. Taylor, Richard Clark, and John Taylor, observing an unusual shifting of the sand, went purposely to see if they could fall in with any of the buried treasure, and strange to say. they commenced their search in a spot were a quantity of the dollars lay ; but unfortunately for them, the tide was just beginning to come in, and soon overflowed the place where the money was ; they continued however to dig till the water got too many for them, and they afterwards said, that they lost many pieces, that were washed off their shovels as they brought them up out of the water. To mark the spot, they stuck a quarry man's bill in the sand, with a string tied to it, and a bit of cork for a buoy ; but on their return the next day, the mark was gone, and it is supposed that no one ever struck upon this particular place again. The affair, however, soon got wind, and a number of people flocked to the sands, from the neighbouring villages, and much quarrelling and fighting took place. A very large number of dollars were found; some persons from Swansea, named Bell, brought with them circular tanks, made do 2"], [658, "220 of sheet iron, open at both ends, and worked inside, but they were not more successful than others. All the money found was of silver, and consisted of dollars, half dollars, and pieces of eight. The late Mrs. Traherne of Coedriglan, near Cardiff, showed me one of the latter coins, in a very fair state of preservation ; it bore on one side the arms of Castile and Leon, and on the other all the quarterings of Spain, and had the number VIII (sic) stamped upon it. The Spaniards call them pesos, and they are the coins that have been made so familiar to us in the pages of Robinson Crus\u0153. All the pieces that came under my notice were much defaced, and the coinage very rough and rude ; the best preserved coins, give the name of Philip the IV (Phillipvs IV, sic), and the date 1625 ; some come down to the year 1639. The Revd. J. Ponsonby Lucas, the present Rector of Rhos-sili, has one in his possession, with that date on it, given him by my late father, the Rector of Reynoldston ; and I have two which he obtained from some of the men who found them in 1833. I lately saw one in a collection of coins of Mr. H. N. Miers, of Ynispenllwch, Swansea Vale ; he did not know its history, and was much pleased to find that it was one of the Rhos-sili bay dollars. He also possesses one of the silver pennies of Ethelred II, one of the Saxon Kings of Englandj A.D. 979, found under a stone near Penrice Castle, in the year 1825 ; about thirty were found altogether, and the greater number of them are still in the possession of C. R. Mansel Talbot, Esq., M.P."], [659, "221 An earlier discovery of these dollars took place in 1807, of this, no one now living has any recollection, but is recorded in The Cambrian Newspaper of March 7th, 1807. I should mention that I am indebted to the Revd. E. Thomas, of Swansea, for the following extract relating to it in that paper. \" Two extraordinary discoveries have recently been made on the coast near Rhoscilly, about 20 miles from Swansea. The tides of late having receded much further than usual, the wreck of a vessel has appeared, which was lost there about 50 years ago, and a cask of iron wire was last week recovered. A short distance from the same spot, about 12lbs of Spanish dollars, and half dollars, of the date 1625, have been found amongst the sand, which are conjectured to have formed part of the cargo of a rich Spanish vessel from South America, called the Scanderoon galley, which was wrecked on that part of the coast upwards of a century since. Several persons now living recollect their relations mentioning the circumstance of the latter ship being lost, and some families residing in the neighbourhood at the time, who suddenly became rich, were supposed to have derived their opulence from the wreck, notwithstanding every possible exertion was made by the then Magistrates of Swansea to secure such part of the property as could be saved, for the benefits of its owners \" The wreck is supposed to have taken place rather more than two hundred years ago, and it is said that the greater bulk of the money was"], [660, "222 obtained by a Mr. Mansel, who lived at that time at Henllys, in the parish of Llandewi, a gentleman of great note in Gower in former days. The Lord of the Manor, by an ancient right, claimed the vessel, but Mr. Mansel broke into it, and got an immense quantity of these dollars, which caused a great dispute. Soon after this he fled the country, and was never seen any more. It is believed by the inhabitants that his spirit still haunts the sands of Rhosili bay, and has been seen driving in a black coach, drawn by four grey horses. This is the origin of the story of the \" Spectre Chariot of Rhosili Sands.\" Many things besides the dollars were found when the last discovery in 1833 took place; amongst them, two iron cannon, now mounted by Mr. Richard H elme, in his garden at Hillend, Llangennydd ; several leaden bullets, as large as musket balls ; many of these were mixed together with bits of iron, as if intended for case shot ; a quantity of antimony, and portions of an astrolabe, an old fashioned instru ment, formerly used on board ship for taking the altitude of the pole star, in order to find the latitude of the place. Antimony in composition with lead and a little copper, is largely employed in the man ufacture of printing types. Some preparations of this mineral are powerful medicines ; it is the prin cipal ingredient in tartar emetic, and in the once well known James' powders. The tradition is, that the vessel wrecked in Rhos sili bay was one of three, filled with treasure, which formed the dowry of a Spanish princess, who had"], [661, "223 married, or was to be married, to an English noble man ; that two of the vessels were lost, and only one reached its destination. Supposing this tradi tion to be founded on truth, the princess might possibly have been Catherine of Braganza, Queen of Charles II. She was however a Portuguese, and not a Spanish lady, and was married to Charles in the year 1661. Rapin, in his history of England, states that the King of Portugal agreed to give with his sister, three hundred thousand pounds sterling ; other authors mention a larger sum. This money must have come by sea, but whether any of it was lost is nowhere recorded. I ought to mention that the tradition also states, that one of the vessels had a large quantity of gold on board, and that this one was wrecked higher up the Burry river. It is by no means unlikely that this part of the story is true, and is confirmed by the fact of the discovery of a quantity of doubloons and gold moidores, about one hundred years ago, by John Richard a fisherman, and Honora his wife, in some crevices of the rocks, in blue pool bay, near the three chimnies ; and more of these coins were found by Thomas Hullin and William Taylor, about forty years ago, in the same place, an account of which has already been given in the notices of Llan genydd parish. The moidore is a Portuguese coin. If these doubloons, moidores, and dollars, really formed a portion of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza, and if any part of it was lost in its transit, it is certainly rather a strange thing that no historian mentions the disaster, and such an omission"], [662, "224 rather militates against the supposition that it formed part of the aforesaid dowry. The dis covery of the money is a fact, but that it formed any portion of the said dowry is only a conjecture, grounded upon the local tradition, a certain affinity of dates between those on the coins themselves, and the time of King Charles' marriage, but this affinity is scarcely close enough to establish the fact, and the absence of any historical evidence seems to point the other way. A few years after the marriage of Charles, viz., in the year 1666, a Portuguese vessel laden with wine, sugar, and Brazil wood, was wrecked on a cer tain sand about 10 miles from Swansea, but what sand is not stated ; the following account relating to it may be found in a letter of one J. Man, in the state papers of that yea,r. \" Dec' 3, 1666. A violent storm of bad weather drove a Phyal vessel laden with wine, sugar, and Brazil wood, on a sand 10 miles off Swansea. The men are Portuguese and cannot speak English. Hoped to have saved the vessel, and refused to save goods, so all are lost.\" But this wreck ofthe Phyal vessel can hardly have anything to do with the dollar ship ; for there is no mention of any treasure in the account, which would scarcely have been omitted by Mr. Man in his report, if there had been any on board ; and moreover, it is to be noted, that Rhosili sands are at least 20, not 10 miles distant from Swansea. Of the last great discovery of dollars in 1833, an account was given in The Cambrian newspaper"], [663, "225 for Jan. 10th, 1834, and as it gives some little addi tional information with regard to the wreck, and a curious claim as to ownership, set up by one of the inhabitants of Rhosili, is rather interesting. \" Remarkable Submarine Discovery.\" \u2014 \" Among the occurrences which have been transmitted by tradition to our neighbours in Gower, is an account of the wreck of a homeward bound Spanish galleon, laden with dollars, on Rhosilly sands, near the Wormshead, shortly after the conquest of South America by the Spaniards. That the crew without giving information of her cargo, sold the wreck for a trifle, to a Mr. Thomas of Pitton, who not being aware of the value of his purchase, or for some other cause, took no pains for her recovery, and that she shortly became completely imbedded in the sands. Nevertheless, suspicion always existed in that part of the country that she must have had on board some valuable articles, and about'\" some twenty-six years ago, in consequence of the sand having drifted very unusually, part of the wreck, in a very decayed state, became visible, and a great quantity of dollars, with some old iron and pewter, was then dug up from some depth in the sand. The late Mr. John Beynon of Pitton, having failed to prove by any written document, the purchase of the vessel by his ancestor (the above named Mr. Thomas) Mr. Talbot of Penrice Castle, as Lord of the Manor, became entitled to the property, but who generously refused to accept of it, and consequently many of the inhabitants were much enriched by the fortuitous * The discovery jnade in 1807. EE"], [664, "226 circumstance. The spot where the vessel struck being only open at four hours ebb tide, and the sand having returned to its old quarters, the money hunters were obliged to desist in their attempts, and all hopes were abandoned of any further booty from that source. During the late gale however the sand having again shifted out, the spot was once more resorted to, and the recovery of a large quan tity of dollars has been the result ; some bearing the date of 1 63 1 , others further back. The circum stance has created a very peculiar interest in the neighbourhood, and it is not likely tbat the present Lord of the Manor, C. R. M. Talbot, Esq., will deviate from the precedent of his respected father. It is to be hoped the neighbourhood, which is very poor, will be considerably benefited by this occurrence.\" Some very amusing stories are told with regard to the discovery and disposal of these dollars by the parties who found them. One man, thinking they would become a drug in the market, sold them much under their value. I need scarcely say they all found their way to the melting pot, with the excep tion of those purchased as curiosities, and still pre served. Another story is told, of a man who went with a good sized bag full to Swansea, to dispose of. He had placed the bag in a cart, in which there was a good deal of straw ; having reached the town, and unharnessed his horse, he took away the bag under his arm, but a neighbour of his from Llanrhidian, who was standing by, having observed a small hole in it, thought it quite possible that some of the coins might have worked their way out ; so when"], [665, "227 the owner had left, he carefully examined the con veyance, and found several pieces scattered about in the bottom of the cart. A few years ago, one was picked up in the bed of the stream that crosses the road near Llangenydd mill ; it was doubtless dropped by some one on his way home from the sands. I think I have stated pretty nearly all that is known of this celebrated Dollar ship. I have only to add, that it is the conviction of the people of Rhosily and Llangenydd, confirmed by the testimony of some few old people still living, who were among the number of those who were digging in 1833, that vast quantities of these dollars yet remain embedded in the sand, which is highly probable, and as the sand often shifts in a very curious way, more of this buried treasure may one day come to light. PAVILAND. The hamlet of Paviland though in Rhosilly parish, pays tithes to the Rector of Penmaen and all rates and taxes are levied with respect to this latter parish. This hamlet was originally a parcel of the lands belonging to the Abbey of Neath and is thus men tioned in the Taxatio Ecclesiastica of Pope Nicolas IV., A.D. 1291. \u00a3 s. d.

Paviland is written Pavilond, and by the \" Fee of Cnoyl,\" the fee of Knelston is intended, sometimes called Knolton. In the Valor Ecclesiasticus of Henry VIII cir 1536 Paviland is written Panylond \" The Grange of Panylond X V S.\" THE PAVILAND CAVES. There are two of these caves, one called \" Goats Hole,\" and at a short distance from each other. In the year 1836 Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys and Col. G. Grant Francis found a brass coin of Constantius II together with a piece of fine Roman terra cotta and a quantity of Celtic flint implements, which were presented to the Museum of the Royal Institution at Swansea. In the same cave (Goats Hole) Mr. Daniel Davies, surgeon, of Reynoldston, found a coin of the Emperor Carausius. Two other brass Roman coins were also found by my late father, who was also lucky enough to discover in the adjacent cave several interesting relics of bygone days \u2014 a bone dagger, a highly polished stone, jagged on one end, as if to afford a firmer grip to the hand, and tapering to a fine edge on the other, which has been"], [667, ""], [668, "Chert s\\en.e t tv fi.1 e m. e rvt Jow-ricl i v Psi>u vlornl/ Ccvire."], [669, ""], [670, ""], [671, "229 slightly chipped ; a small bone piercer, and a number of flint chippings ; in short the store of the latter is almost inexhaustible ; hundreds have been carried away, and numbers yet remain to reward future explorers. The drawings (full size) of the above mentioned implements will give a better idea of them than any description. They are all preserved in the museum at Penrice Castle ; Miss Talbot kindly supplied me with the drawings from which the lithographs were taken. \u2022 Tn the cave where my father found these articles Dr. Buckland, in the year 18*\"\", discovered a female skeleton. It had been interred on the left hand side, going in, and not far from the mouth of the cave. The bones were quite red, and appeared as if they had been painted ; but this was caused by the nature of the soil in which they had been buried. On one side of the remains he found about two handfuls of small shells, and from forty to fifty fragments of small ivory rods, from one to three quarters of an inch in diameter, together with bits of ivory rings, which must have been four or five inches in diameter, and some other articles fashioned out of ivory, by hand, of a star like form, and pierced through the centre, evidently part of a necklace ; the following woodcuts of this orna ment, were made from a drawing given me by the late Mrs. Traherne of Coedriglan."], [672, "230 These caves are only accessible at low water, and are situate about one hundred feet below the level of the land above, and about forty feet above high water mark. I ought to mention that although these caves are called the Paviland caves, they are not really on any part of Paviland, but rather under Pilton ; the reason why they got this name was, because the road that visitors take, and the only available one, is through Paviland farm. PILTON. That is TJphiltown, for this seems to be the true name, according to the following entry which appears in the old Register books of Marriages, Baptisms, and Burials, of the Parish of Llandewi : \u2014 \" John the son of Jno. Jone of Pilton (alias Uphilton) Green, was baptised at Llandewi, Feb. 17, 1714\" In an inquisitio post mortem of the 1st year of Edwd. IV, A.D. 1461, concerning the lands and manors in Gower, of John de Mowbray, third Duke of Norfolk, mention is made of a place termed \" Ulpeden.\" There is I think very little doubt that the place now called Pilton, is here intended. The orthography of names of places is often very corrupt in ancient documents, and the rendering of them in Latin distorted them still more ; yet even here, which is perhaps about the oldest reference we can find to this place, the name \" Ulpeden \" as it appears in the above mentioned inquisitio, is sufficiently like Uphiltown, as to lead us to think that such was its original name."], [673, "231 PITTON AND PILTON. The present inhabitants always speak of these as two different places, but it is really not so, the names are identical. Pitton alias Pilton, or Pilton alias Pitton, is an ancient manor ; it is sometimes written one way and sometimes another, as the following references will show. MANOR OF PILTON. In a survey of the 25th of Queen Elizabeth, A.D. 1583, the Manor of Pitton alias Pilton is re turned as being held by the service of a Knight's fee of the Earl of Worcester. \" PILTON.\" \" Manes m de Pitton aes de Pilton tenetur p9unum feod militar.\" That is, the Manor of Pitton alias of Pilton is held by one Knight's Fee. In the same survey it is mentioned again along with the Manor of Verne Hill, thus : \" Manerium de Pilton et Vernell (alias) Verne hill tenet de dco dno p servic unius feod militar ptem cujus manery Owenus Perkins, Ricardus Bidder, et Morgan Vaughan tenen vocat Verne hill p servic quarte partis feodi militar, et sex sagittas voeatas swallow tayld arrows solvend annuatim vel in defect inde vjd. That is, The Manor of Pilton and Ver nell, alias Verne Hill, is held of the said Lord, by the service of one Knight's Fee, Owen Perkins, Richard Bidder, and Morgan Vaughn, hold part of this Manor, called Verne hill, by the service of a fourth part of a Knight's Fee, and six arrows, called swallow tailed arrows, paid annually, or in default of that, 6d. Immediately following the above extract we meet another presentment of the Jury, concerning certain lands at Pilton :"], [674, "232 \" Robertus Heron Johes Tayler et Willimus Grove tenent diversas terr nup Johis St. John apud Pilton p servic quarte partie ffeocl militar et sex sagitt vocatas swallow tayld arrowes vel in defectu inde vjd.\" That is, Robert *Heron, John Taylor, and William Grove hold divers lands, lately of John St. John, at Pilton, by the service of a fourth part of a Knight's Fee and six arrows called swallow tailed arrows, or in default 6d. In Gabriel Powell's survey of the Lordship of Gower, made in A.D. 1764, Vernhill is mentioned as a manor : \" VERNHILL MANOR.\" \" The late Mrs. Dawkin and Richard Bidder hold the Manor of Vernhill by ffealty, Suit of Court, Heriot, and the payment at Michas yearly of six swallow tailed arrows or sixpence.\" In another place in the above mentioned survey we meet with the following memorandum : \" The late Mrs. Dawkins of Kittlehill and one Daniel Curtis held several parcels of lands at Pilton by ffealty, suit of Court, Heriot, and payment at Michas yearly of six swallow tailed arrows or sixpence.\" I have not been able to get the boundaries of the Manor of Pilton or Vernhill, but the latter appears to have been a very small one consisting of a few acres of land. The mention of the name of \u00b0Robert Heron of Pilton, given in the Survey of the Manor of Pilton, made in A.D. 1583, 25th Queen Elizabeth, is probably a misprint for Robert Hearne, for there was a family of this name living at Pilton, and apparently of good standing in Gower in the 16th Century, if not earlier : it is mentioned in Mr. G. T. Clarke's collection of Gower pedigrees, who has kindly allowed me to make use of them Query Hearne ? Vid, Pedigree ol Hearne of Pilton."], [675, "233 HEARNE OF PILTON.

Unfortunately there are no dates in the fore going pedigree ; all we know for certain, is, that Nicolas Hearne was a party to a deed concerning Whitwell, in Knelston, rg. Henry VIII, A.D. 1538 ; and his son Richard, was a party to a deed concern ing the same place in the 6th Ed. VI. A.D. 1553. The following rather unusual occurrence is per haps not unworthy of being recorded, in connection with the foregoing notices of this Hamlet ; it was published in The Cambrian newspaper for Jan. 11, 1806 : \u2014 \"At Pilton Green, near Swansea, Mrs. Bevan, of three daughters, which, with the mother, are likely to do well.\" Here many years ago lived David William, the celebrated coffin maker, of Pilton ; he was also noted as the best hand at making spinning turns (i.e., spinning wheels) in Gower ; he is reported to have * This is probably the penon called Robert Heron in the Survey of the Manor taken in 1583. FF"], [676, "234 made his own coffin 20 years before his death, but if any one wanted a coffin, he used to sell it, if it suited, and then make another for himself. In the rocks under Pilton there is a hole, running a considerable way into the cliff, and a little above high water mark ; at the end of the hole there is a wooden platform covering a deep shaft, supposed to have been sunk by miners searching for lead ore. My informant, Charles Lewis, stated, that he had been told by a man who had lately explored this hole, that at the extreme end, certain dates were to be seen, cut on the stones, going back at least one hundred years. BASE OF VILLAGE CROSS, Near the gate of Rhossilly Church. This quadrangular structure, of which the draw ing is a correct representation, may, I think, be identified with the site of the old village cross, and formed its base, the only portion now remaining. In pre-reformation times crosses were set up every where ; there was always one in the churchyard, vid. Institutions of William of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, in A.D. 1229 : \" Let a handsome cross be erected in every churchyard, to which the proces sion shall be made on Palm Sunday.\" There was also a cross in every village, and in all market places ; one of the latter sort once stood in the centre of Penrice village, but the base only remains. They are to be found by the way side, at cross roads, at the entrance of towns, and ends of bridges. In an old book, called \" Dives and Pauper,\" date 1496, we have contemporary evidence given"], [677, "f Base \u00b0\\ Villtiue Cross , Rhostti,."], [678, ""], [679, "237 why the cross was thus erected everywhere : \"for thys reasan ben crosses by ye waye, that when folke passynge see the crosses they should thynke on Hym that dyed on ye crosse and worshippe Hym aboue all thynge.\" Vid. also Church Builder for July, 1869.
