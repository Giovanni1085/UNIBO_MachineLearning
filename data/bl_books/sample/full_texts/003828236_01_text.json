Ladies and Gentlemen, of every description and of both sexes !\u2014 If there are any among you afflicted with the ills of life which flesh is heir to \u2014 whether rheu- matism, sciatica, consumption, liver com- plaint, heartburn, sea-sickness, or impecu- niosity, whether inflammation of the lungs, concentralization of the nose, acclimization of the spinal marrow, or a want of vitality in the vegetable marrow, gravel, stone, or asphalte, tits and starts and feeling anyhow, an attack of the blues, whether male or female\u2014 in short, for every complaint under the sun, whether known or unknown, mortal or immortal, curable or incurable, I invite you to pay heed to some of the most wonder- ful cures which have been effected by my Orieutal Restorative Medicines. Here is a bottle which I hold up for your inspection. I shall, however, not allow this bottle to be sold, until I have explained its peculiar virtues and the ingredients of which it is composed. My medicines, ladies and gentle- men, are compounded out of the finest roots, herbs, and barks throughout the vegetable kiugdom, and as gathered by my numerous assistants in every part of the habitable globe. The chief ingredients of this bottle are as follows : Fig leaves from the giant trees of California, dandelion from Epping Forest, Turkey rhubarb from Asia Minor, balsam from the gum-trees of Arabia, cod- liver oil from Billingsgate, quinine from Canada, elder flowers from South Africa, phosphorus from the Desert of Sahara, palm twigs from Palestine, burnt sienna from Primrose Hill, rock rose and stinging-nettle from Clapham Common, and a hundred other active medicinal virtues from both hemis- pheres, all powdered up together in a very concentrated form. Every year, ladies and gentlemen, I spend fifteen months abroad in personally superintending the preparation of my wonderful medicines; and if you were to see, So if you're ill attend to me. When evening comes, I take my stand Upon the broad highway ; And then address the passers-by Without the least delay. They know me for a perfect cure, A curer of their ills, And quickly fall to purchasing My medicines and my pills. Spoken.\u2014 I beg to hold up this bottle for your inspection ; but I will not even tell you the price of it until I have read to you a few choice testimonials as follows : \" Dear sir, \u2014 I had my head smashed with a quart put ; cured with one bottle.\" \"I had the buffer of a railway carriage run into my stomach ; it had to be extracted by means of a steam crane; cured with oue bottle.\" \"I had my right arm crushed in my mother's wringing machine ; but after a regular dose of your medicine for breakfast -evei-y morning, my arm was completely restored.\" \" I was tickled to death with a flea-bite; but three doses of your medicine completely brought me to.\" \"I was jammed into a pancake between two fat women in a crowd.

In conclusion, I would beg you not to neglect the golden opportunity of purchasing my medicines. I attend all the important races, fairs, and markets, not forgetting the Whitechapel pavement. But to-day, being my birthday, it is only by an extraordinary freak of nature that I am here at all. I can, therefore, do no more than exhort you to consult your own welfare, and to take care of your feeble health, feeling sure that, if you should go home to-night and die before the morning, you would be blaming yourselves for ever afterwards for not having purchased my Oriental Restora tive Medicines I Chorus.

I LOVE THE LIGHT OF A DEAR BLUE EYE. Charles Paoe.) [Charles Page. Published by the London Musical Agency, 132, Clerkenwell Road, E.C. High above the darken'd altar, AVhile the weeping mourners pray, While sweet voices humbly falter \" Miserere Domine ! \" Thrills the tumult of his rolling, Slowly swinging to and fro, Booms aloud his muffled tolling, Chanting all a country's woe ; But a song of hope is chiming, Far above his solemn roar, And the wave of sound is climbing, Till it breaks on Heaven's shore. Some love the twinkling stars, Some love the moon's pale beam, Some love the light of the noonday bright, And the sun's rich golden gleam ; But I love a light more rare, A light that I dearly prize, Sweeter by far than sun, moon, or star, Is the light of my love's blue eyes. CHORUS. I love the light of a dear blue eye, I love the night and a clear blue sky, I love to hear a lover sigh, Darling, I love you ! High above triumphal arches, Festal banners, joyous throng, AVhile the bright procession marches, Trolls the bell his gladsome song ; And in ev'ry grand vibration, lie re-echoes each brave cheer, Sounds the w-elcome of a nation, free as air and blind to fear. And the song of hope is chiming, Far above his solemn roar, And the wave of sound is climbing, Till it breaks on Heaven's shore. Strolling along the sands, Down by the murmuring sea, How sweet to feel a fond arm steal Bound your waist so tenderly. But not in the day, oh, no ! Too many eyes would view ; Bat let the night eome, and then we may roam, And do as true lovers do. Chorus."], [66, "58 MODERN SONG BOOK. NAME THE DAY. THE BONNIE LASS 0' KIRKWALL.
