In publishing the following Tragedies I have only to repeat that they were not composed with the most remote view to the stage. On the attempt made by the Managers in a former instance, the public opinion has been already expressed. With regard to my own private feelings, as it seems that they are to stand for nothing, I shall say nothing. For the historical foundation of the following compositions, the reader is referred to the Notes.

But \" Nous avons change tout cela,\" and are reap- ing the advantages of the change. The writer is far from conceiving that any thing he can ad- duce by personal precept or example can at all approach his regular, or even irregular prede- cessors : he is merely giving a reason why he preferred the more regular formation of a struc- ture, however feeble, to an entire abandonment of all rules whatsoever.

Au milieu de ces prosperites, de grands chagrins vinrent mettre a l'epreuve la fermete de son ame. Son fils, Jacques Foscari, fut accuse, en 1445, d'avoir re^u des presents de quelques princes ou seigneurs etrangers, no tamment, disait-on, du due de Milan, Philippe Visconti.

Pendant plusieurs tours de scrutin ses amis les plus zeles s'etaient abstenus de lui donner leur suffrage, pour que les autres ne le considerassent pas comme un concurrent redoutable*. Le conseil des dix craignait son credit parmi la noblesse pauvre, parce qu'il avait cherche a se la rendre favorable, tandis qu'il etait procurateur de Saint-Marc, en faisant employer plus de trente mille ducats a doter des jeunesfilles de bonne maison, ou i etablir de jeunes gentilshommes. On craignoit encore sa nombreuse famille, car alors il etait pere de quatre enfans, et marie de nouveau ; enfin on redoutait son ambition et son gout pour la guerre. L'opinion que ses adversaires s'etaient formee de lui fut v.rifiee par les evenemens ; pendant trente-quatre ans que Foscari fut ii la tete de la republique, elle ne cessa point de combattre. Si les hostilites etaient suspendues durant quelques mois, c'etait pour recommencer bientot avec plus de vigueur. Ce fut l'epoque ou Venise etendit son empire sur Brescia, Bergame, Ravenne, et Cr.me ; ou elle fonda sa domination de Lombardie, et parut sans cesse sur le point d'asservir toute cette province. Profond, cou- rageux, inibranlable, Foscari communiqua aux conseils son propre caractere, et ses talens lui firent obtenir plus d'in- fiuence sur la republique, que n'avaient exerce la plupart de ses pr.d.cesseurs. Mais si son ambition avait eu pour but Pagrandissement de sa famille, elle fut cruellement trompt'e : trois de ses fils moururent dans les huit annees qui suivirent son election ; le quatri.me, Jacob, par lequel la maison Foscari s'est perpetuee, fut victime de la jalousie du conseil des dix, et empoisonna par ses mafheurs les jours de son p.re f.

Au mois de Fevrier 1445, Michel Bevilacqua, Florentin, exile a Venise, accusa en secret Jacques Foscari aupres des inquisiteurs d'etat, d'avoir recu de due Philippe Visconti, des presens d' argent et de joyaux, pars les mains des gens de sa maison. Telle etait l'odieuse procedure adoptee a Venise, que sur cette ac cusation secrete, le fils du doge, du representant de la majeste de la republique, fut mis a la torture.

Cependant, le vaisseau qui le portait ayant touch, a Trieste, Jacob, grievement malade des suites de la torture, et plus encore de l'humiliation qu'il avait eprouvee, demanda en grace au conseil des dix de n'etre pas envoye plus loin.

En vain Jacob Foscari, oblige de se presenter chaque jour au gouverneur de la Canee, reclamait contre l'injustice de sa derniere sentence, sur laquelle la confession d'Erizzo ne laissait plus de doutes. En vain il demandait grace au farouche conseil des dix ; il ne pouvait obtenir aucune re ponse. Le desir de revoir son pere et sa mere, arrives tous deux au dernier terme de la vieillesse, le desir de revoir une patrie dont la cruaute ne meritait pas un si tendre amour, se changerent en lui en une vraie fureur. Ne pouvant re tourner a Venise pour y vivre libre, il voulut du moins y aller chercher un supplice. II ecrivit au due de Milan a la fin de Mai, 1456, pour implorer sa protection aupres du senat : et sachant qu'une telle lettre seroit consideree comme un crime, il l'exposa lui-meme dans un lieu ou il etait sur qu'elle seroit saisie par les espions qui l'entouraient. En effet, la lettre etant deferee au conseil des dix, on l'envoya chercher aussitot, et il fut reconduit a Venise le 19 Juillet, 1456*. Jacob Foscari ne nia point sa lettre, il raconta en meme temps dans quel but il l'avait ecrite, et comment il l'avait fait tomber entre les mains de son delateur. Malgre ces aveux, Foscari fut remis a la torture, et on lui donna trente tours d'estrapade, pour voir s'il confirmerait ensuite ses de positions. Quand on le detacha de la corde, on le trouva dechire par ces horribles secousses. Les juges permirent alors _ son pere, a sa mere, a sa femme, et a ses fils, d'aller le voir dans sa prison. Le vieux Foscari, appuye sur un baton, ne se traina qu'avec peine, dans la chambre ou son fils unique etait pans, de ses blessures. Ce fils demandait encore la grace de mourir dans sa maison. \u2014 \" Retourne a \" ton exil, mon fils, puisque ta patrie l'ordonne,\" lui dit le * Marin Sanuto, p. 1 162.

II etait entre dans sa quatre-vingt-sixieme annie, et si le conseil des dix avait _te susceptible de quel que pitie, il aurait attendu en silence la fin, sans doute pro chaine, d'une carri.re marquee par tant de gloire et tant de malheurs.

Another charge made, I am told, in the \" Literary Gazette\" is, that I wrote the notes to \" Queen Mab ;\" a work which I never saw till some time after its publication, and which I recollect showing to Mr. Sotheby as a poem of great power and imagination. I never wrote a line of the notes, nor ever saw them except in their published form. No one knows better than their real author, that his opinions and mine differ materially upon the metaphysical portion of that work ; though in common with all who are not blinded by baseness and bigotry, I highly admire the poetry of that and his other publication-. Mr. Southey, too, in his pious preface to a poem whose blasphemy is as harmless as the sedition of Wat Tyler, be cause it is equally absurd with that sincere production, calls upon the \" legislature to look to it, \"* as the toleration of such writings led to the French Revolution : not such writings as Wat Tyler, hut as those of the \" Satanic School.\" This is not true, and Mr. Southey knows it to be not true. Every French writer of any freedom was persecuted ; Voltaire and Rousseau were exiles, Marmontel and Diderot were sent to the Bastille, and a perpetual war was waged with the whole class by the existing despotism. In the next place, the French Revolution was not occasioned by any writings what soever, but must have occurred had no such writers ever existed. It is the fashion to attribute every thing to the"], [341, "THE TWO FOSCARI. 327 r French revolution, and the French revolution to every thing but its real cause. That cause is obvious \u2014 the government exacted too much, and the people could neither give nor bear more. Without this, the Encyclopedists might have written their fingers off without the occurrence of a single alteration. And the English revolution \u2014 (the first, I mean) \u2014 what was it occasioned by ? The puritans were surely as pious and moral as Wesley or his biographer ? Acts \u2014 acts on the part of government, and not writings against them, have caused the past convulsions, and are tending to the future. I look upon such as inevitable, though no revolutionist : I wish to see the English constitution restored and not de stroyed. Born an aristocrat, and naturally one by temper, with the greater part of my present property in the funds, what have I to gain by a revolution ? Perhaps I have more to lose in every waj* than Mr. Southey, with all his places and presents for panegyrics and abuse into the bargain, But that a revolution is inevitable, I repeat. The govern ment may exult over the repression of petty tumults ; these are but the receding waves repulsed and broken for a moment on the shore, while the great tide is still rolling on and gaining ground with every breaker. Mr. Southey ac cuses us of attacking the religion of the country ; and is he abetting it by writing lives of Wesley? One mode of wor ship is merely destroyed by another. There never was, nor ever will be, a country without a religion. We shall be told of France again : but it was only Paris and a frantic party, which for a moment upheld their dogmatic nonsense of theo-philanthropy. The church of England, if overthrown, will be swept away by the sectarians and not by the scep tics. People are too wise, too well informed, too certain of their own immense importance in the realms of space, ever to submit to the impiety of doubt. There may be a few"], [342, "328 ATPENDIX TO such diffident speculators, like water in the pale sunbeam of human reason, but they are very few ; and their opinions, without enthusiasm or appeal to the passions, can never gain proselytes \u2014 unless, indeed, they are persecuted \u2014 that, to be sure, will increase any thing. Mr. S., with a cowardly ferocity, exults over the antici pated \" death-bed repentance \" of the objects of his dislike ; and indulges himself in a pleasant \" Vision of Judgment,'' in prose as well as verse, full of impious impudence. What Mr. S.'s sensations or ours may be in the awful moment of leaving this state of existence neither he nor we can pretend to decide. In common, I presume, with most men of any reflection, I have not waited for a \" death-bed\" to repent of many of my actions, notwithstanding the \" diabolical pride\" which this pitiful renegado in his rancour would impute to those who scorn Aim. Whether upon the whole the good or evil of my deeds may preponderate is not for me to ascertain ; but, as my means and opportunities have been greater, I shall limit my present defence to an assertion (easily proved, if necessary,) that 1, \"in my degree,'\" have done more real good in any one given year, since I was twenty, than Mr. Southey in the whole course of his shifting and turncoat existence. There are several actions to which I can look back with an honest pride, not to be damped by the calumnies of a hireling. There are others to which I recur with sorrow and repentance; but the only act of my life of which Mr. Southey can have any real knowledge, as it was one which brought me in contact with a near connexion of his own, did no dishonour to that connexion nor to me. I am not ignorant of Mr. Southey s calumnies on a dif ferent occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his return from Switzerland against me and others: they have done him no good in this world; and, if his creed"], [343, "329 THE TWO FOSCARI. be the right one, they will do him less in the next. What his \" death-bed\" may be, it is not my province to predicate : let him settle it with his Maker, as I must do with mine. There is something at once ludicrous and blasphemous in this arrogant scribbler of all works sitting down to deal damnation and destruction upon his fellow creatures, with Wat Tyler, the Apotheosis of George the Third, and the Elegy on Martin the regicide, all shuffled together in his writing desk. One of his consolations appears to be a Latin note from a work of a Mr. Landor, the author of \" Gebir,\" whose friendship for Robert Southey will, it seems, \" be an honour to him when the ephemeral disputes and ephemeral reputa tions of the day are forgotten.\" I for one neither envy him \" the friendship,\" nor the glory in reversion which is to accrue from it, like Mr. Thelusson's fortune in the third and fourth generation. This friendship will probably be as memorable as his own epics, which (as I quoted to him ten or twelve years ago in \" English Bards\") Porson said \" would be re membered when Homer and Virgil are forgotten, and not till then.\" For the present, I leave him."], [344, ""], [345, "CAIN, A MYSTERY. \" Now the Serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.\" \u2014 Gen. iii. 1."], [346, ""], [347, "TO SIR WALTER SCOTT, BART.

The following scenes are entitled \" a Mys tery,\" in conformity with the ancient title an nexed to dramas upon similar subjects, which were styled \" Mysteries, or Moralities.\" The author has by no means taken the same liberties with his subject which were common formerly, as may be seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane productions, whether in English, French, Italian, or Spanish. The author has endeavoured to preserve the language adapted to his characters ; and where it is (and this is but rarely) taken from actual Scripture, he has made as little alteration, even of words, as the rhythm would permit. The reader will recollect that the book of Genesis does not state that Eve was tempted by a demon, but by \" the Serpent \u2022\" and that only because he was \" the most subtil of all the beasts of the field.\" Whatever interpretation the Rabbins and the Fathers may have put"], [350, "336 PREFACE TO CAIN. upon this, I must take the words as I find them, and reply with Bishop Watson upon similar oc- casions, when the Fathers were quoted to him, as Moderator in the Schools of Cambridge, \" Behold the Book !\" \u2014 holding up the Scrip- ture. It is to be recollected that my present subject has nothing to do with the jSfew Testa- ment, to which no reference can be here made without anachronism. With the poems upon similar topics I have not been recently familiar. Since I was twenty, I have never read Milton ; but I had read him so frequently before, that this may make little difference. Gesner's \" Death of Abel\" I have never read since I was eight years of age, at Aberdeen. The general impression of my recollection is delight; but of the contents I remember only that Cain's wife was called Mahala, and Abel's Thirza. \u2014 In the following pages I have called them \" Adah \" and \" Zillah,\"the earliest female names which occur in Genesis ; they were those of Lamech's wives : those of Cain and Abel are not called by their names. Whether, then, a coincidence of subject may have caused the same in expression, I know nothing, and care as little. The reader will please to bear in mind (what lew choose to recollect) that there is no allusion"], [351, "337 PREFACE TO CAIN. to a future state in any of the books of Moses, nor indeed in the Old Testament. For a reason for this extraordinary omission he may consult \" Warburton's Divine Legation ;\" whether satisfactory or not, no better has yet been assigned. I have therefore supposed it new to Cain, without, I hope, any perversion of Holy Writ. With regard to the language of Lucifer, it was difficult for me to make him talk like a Clergyman upon the same subjects ; but I have done what I could to restrain him within the bounds of spiritual politeness. If he disclaims having tempted Eve in the shape of the Serpent, it is only because the book of Genesis has not the most distant allu sion to any thing of the kind, but merely to the Serpent in his serpentine capacity. Note. \u2014 The reader will perceive that the au thor has partly adopted in this poem the notion of Cuvier, that the world had been destroyed se veral times before the creation of man. This spe culation, derivedfrom the different strata and the bones of enormous and unknown animals found in them, is not contrary to the Mosaic account, but rather confirms it ; as no human bones have z"], [352, "338 PREFACE TO CAIN. yet been discovered in those strata, although those of many known animals are found near the remains of the unknown. The assertion of Lucifer, that the pre-adamite world was also peopled by rational beings much more intelli gent than man, and proportionably powerful to the mammoth, _-C. _-c. is, of course, a poetical fiction to help him to make out his case.
