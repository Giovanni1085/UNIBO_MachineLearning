A waiter's life is not so gay, carrying dishes, plates, or tray, For linen I've a lot to pay, in evening dress I'm all the day. The things you've got to do and say, fetch and take or clear away, It's quite enough to make you say, you'd never wait again. Folks havn't got the slightest thought, they never stop to reason, And what they want are just those things quite gone out of season. Season ! 'pon m}' word people's got no sense.

Small things causes lots of worry, With me 1 think you'll agree, And if you're not in a hurry, Kindiy listen unto me. My wife's gone, and Im forsaken, A streaky rasher caused the row, Who'd have thought a piece of bacon Would make her break her marriage vow, This morning, 1 remarked the rasher. Wasn't cookea and rather black, Then with it she gave me a basher. Then poured the hot fat down my back, Chorus. My wife's gone and left me all alone, My wife's gone and left me here to mourn, I shall soon be nought but skin and bone, All through a little piece of bacon! When I asked her if she'd marry, Something seemed to say to me, Young man you had better tarry, For deceived you're sure to be. Still. I thought, oh, I'm mistaken, She will love me all through life, But who'd have thought a piece of baeon, Would have parted man and wife. To cheer her up 1 had no power. And 1 was anxious of her health, For she would sit for hour and hour, Throwing bacon at herself. Show me who invented bacon, On his chest I'd like to jump, An oath against it i have taken. And Watling's pies give me the hump. And if 1 see pork chops or liver, Or a plate of fat pig's fry. It matters not, I al ays shiver, Pork sausages, they make me cry.

Oh, she did look pretty ! \u2014 well, no, not pretty, far from it, but she's got such a \u2014 what shall 1 say, a face, a telling face. What the poets calia chisel face (no, that's not it); 1 have it, an open countenance. When she opens her mouth there's no countenance at all And ! what a figure! Oh, dear, a kind of four pound loaf sort of shape ! And I looked a bit of a toff myself ; oh, yes! Fancy these clothes when new! Well, new to me; I don't know whether anyone else had worn them before! And what a wedding ! Oh, dear, 1 should think there was thousands of people outside the church watching a dog fight: nothing to do with us but still it looked nice to see them there And when the parson passed sentence on us. 1 beg pardon, not sentence. 1 mean when he said something and we both said no when we should have said yes, and the organ played the 'Lost Chord' and a portion of the roof fell in and nearly smothered us. 1 thought this is happiness! And we should have had nought but bliss if this madness, this bacon fever, hadn't come upon her. Fancy she'd got bacon on the brain and 1 didn't know it! Yet 1 thought it strange, for I'd noticed we had bacon for breakfast every morning for three months. So one morning I said \u2014 wife, don't let us have any more cooked bacon for food ; make a change.' She did, she put it oil the table raw. Well, then I lost my temper ; no wonder, tread on a turn and it will worm.

When I came home at three the next morn ing there was no wife. 1 thought, perhaps she s gone out shopping. Alas.no! she'd left me for ever. Oh, she was mad! There's proofs. When 1 went to bed there was a piece of streaky fastened to my pillow There's no doubt she'd gone off her head!

The scene was a station, the time was mid- night. The fatal word fire on the lamps glittered bright; The firemen are dozing, while, safely at hand. The horses were waiting the word of com- mand. Click goes the message of danger aud death, Down dash the firemen not pausing for breath, In go the horses, hi ! hi ! clear the way, While borne on the zephyrs a voice seemed to say. Chorus. Heaven speed the members of the fire brigade, Heroes true as steel, hearts that never fear, Ready, steady and undismayed, Are the noble hearted members of the fire brigade. On like the wind, how the horses perspire. See they arrive at the scene of the fire ; Crash go the beams of the roof to the ground, Scorching the people standing around. Hark! how that cry of dismay rends the air. Look at yon window, a woman's up there! lTp goes a fireman, with resolute will. Hushed are the people, the boldest are still. Steadilly upward, still higher and higher. Choking and scorched by the smoke and the fire. Onward he goes till the woman he ncars. Stop \u2014 see \u2014 shefalters. and then disappears. Down go the sashes, lies in through the frame. Out with the woman he comes once again. Faint and half blinded he reaches the ground. While to the skies goes the echoing sound. Pause and reflect ere you venture to doubt. The truth of the scene I'm singing about, I know the fireman who ventured his life, The woman he rescued to day is his wife.

Turn adrift a helpless tenant. Though he could extend his aid. Starving tenants, wealthy landlords, Contrasts only seem in vain. When they pay the debt of nature, Both will reach a common plain.

I had but one chum, he was just like a brother. As brave as a lion, and true to the core ; And with the pride of a true-hearted lover, Under his tunic he constantly wore: ChoruB Leaves from the trees where they both used to roam, Sent by his sweetheart from home, sweet home; And 'neath those trees she thinks and grieves Of hopes that are withered like the faded leaves.

Defending the sick \u2014 what a glorious part \u2014 And there in the twilight his thoughts seemed to wander To that dearest keepsake he wore next his heart. With a crash like the sea came the foe down upon us, The earth seemed to shake as they met British steel, Hand to hand, back to back, cutting, thrusting like demons. We hurled them back headlong away down the hill Before British eyes was our hospital blazing, Oar sick being slaughtered, vet we dare not come.

To witness the Derby at Epsom you know, Some bicycle riders determined to go; Of course they concluded to travel by road. Commencing at eight from their captain's abode. Well, three of them started and all looked serene, When a steam-roller cannoned the leadens machine, The brake of the second one snapped into twain, and the third lost his balance and fell down a drain. Chorus. That was me, that was me, Fvcn now in Condy's fluid I have to rinse, It's k marvel how enduring ar* the miseries of touring, Por I've never been the same road slnoe Ib th* gre*ne*t of meadows one fln* \u00bbft*x- A swell and a lady were having a spoon, With tbe old-fashisned stuff he was filling her head, And ah* like a woman believed all he laid. Now a bull had been watching thi* loving And being inquisitive made for the pair; 80 th* lady skedaddled, as ditto did he, Bnt was oaught and assisted np into \u2022 tree. Chorus. That was me. that was me, My position was as lofty as a prince, For my hat was vaccinated and my trousers ventilated, And l'v* never wore the same \" bag*,\" since. The time was the morning, the hour about three, The place was the Tillage of Slosh ton-on- And inside a bedroom, the best to be had, A man with bis boots on wa* snoring Ilk* mad, H*'d been for a sail with his friend* \u2022\u25a0 the foaan, And with their assistance had \"screw'd\" his way home; To try and see life he declared he'd a whim And by jingo the fleas made it lively for him. Chorus. That was me, that was me. They were there in all varieties and tints ) They were so very nimble, and at every bite they raised a pimple.

Composer, j. S. Baker. Sung by Herbert Campbell. Music Published hy C. Sheard & Co., 192, High Holborn, W.C. Some pals of mine were going for the day, For a bit of a blow out Chingford w-ay, 'Twas a 'go as you please' along the route, And a firut class prize for the best turn out. They came in carts, and waggonettes as well, And which looked best 'twas very hard to tell; Says Brown, give the prize now, for we cannot wait \u2014 Stop ! here comes Ginger, and he's not too late.' Chorus, Then up I came with my little lot, And the tads yelled out, 'hooray ! ' Some chairs for my pals, and cushions for the gals, And the hearthrug looked all gay. There were fourteen of us, and we all had whips. And the missis she had hold of the brake, I nut 'em all to bed, for everybody said That my lot took the cake. When we got down 'twas beautiful and warm, We quite took the hotel there by storm; We'd swings, and booze, and cocoanut shies, Then we all went in for the swearing prize Bach lot as came all pulled up in a row. And one by one we then all had a go; And oh I the language, how the beauties swore! Says Brown hold hard a bit, there's one lot more.' Then up I came with my little lot, And the air went bine for miles; The trees all shook, and the copper took his hook. And down came all the tiles: Then the donkeys cocked their tails and did a guy. And brayed as if their hearts would break ; We asked Dick Dunn, and be told every one That my lot took the cake. For tea at six o'clock we all prepared. Aud we didn't care how the people stared, The ladies stood in the gigs and flys. And the next event was the \"beauty prize.' But what with the dust and all their dresses spoiled, The beauties all looked just a little bit soiled, They tried to look sober, and smiled serene. When Smith calls out, 'now which is th* queen? ' Then up I came with my little lot. And I says this can't be matched \u2014 She fell off her moke, and her funnibone is broke, And her boko's a little bit scratched. She's, sixteen stone, and it's every bit her own, And the colour on her cheeks it isn't fake. She's forty round the calf, then Brown be- gan to laugh, And my lot took the cake. Next for home we st arted, all of us 'hooray,' And the pubs we called at, along the way, We burnt red fire just to let them see, We'd all come home from ajolly good spree. To believe our tales they all of 'em refused, Some said, \"get out, why none of you are boozed.' Says Brown, I'll quickly show you if we'r* not, Hold on a bit, where's Ginger's lot? ' Then up 1 came with my merry lot, And Brownsays, 'where have they gone?' They were all of a heap, and everyone asleep, With their bonnets and things all torn. The p'lice got stretchers a away they went. And I'm jiggered if they would wake: Says I, 'who say si hat we're not half boozed For my lot takes the cake.'"], [36, "T A COLLECTION OP FAVOURITE SONGS. Jessie, the Star of Glengore. Composed by George Howard. Music Published by C. Sheard * Co., 192, High Holborn, W.C. When the bright moon is up o'er the steep craggy mountain. My ain bonnie lassie will come to my side. We sit 'neath the shade, by the murmur- ing fountain, That gladdens the vale with its silvery tide. With sweet darling Jessie to comfort and cheer me. My heart overflows with the wealth of its store. As I journey thro* life may she ever be near me, My ain bonnie Jessie the star of Glen- gore. 1 ken there is one wi* o'er plenty o' siller, Would fain win a glance from her beau- tiful e'e, But my ain bonnie lassie has nought for the miller, She keeps all her lore ana her glances for me. Tho' tar from my home aad my kindred I'm turning, I picture the future with bright day* iu store. My heart with the fire of affection is burn- ing. For bonnie sweet Jessie the star of Glengore. My ain Highland lassie I ken that she lo'es me, I read the sweet truth in her dear eyes of blue, Thy heart of pure gold with its constancy proves thee. My darling, my treasure, sae good and &ae true. Thou'rt pure as an angel I ne'er shall for- get thee, Tho fortune divide us, to me^t never more. My heart will go forth to seek and togreat thee. My ain bonnie Jessie the star of Glen- gore. Poor Little Dolly. Written by Marie Heath. Composed by Geo. Schleiffarth. Music Published by C. Sheard & Co.. 192, High Holborn, W.C. Sweet imitation of feminine beauty. Whence come the roses that grow on j'our cheek? Sitting up late does not seem to destroy them, What would you say if you only could speak ? Life is but short from the day you are carried. Homeward in triumph, away from the store ; Baby will soon want to know what you're made of, And scatter your \" stuffing \" all over the floor. Refrain. Poor little dolly! (\"ma'ma, ma'ma*' ) poor little dolly ! (''ma'ma. ma'ma'' ), Juet like a woman whenyou have grown old; You'll be neglected and left in the cold. You'll be ueglected and left in the cold^ Now you are fondled and placed in a car- riage, Told you're a beauty, and handled with care. Wait till your nose and your cheeks have been battered. Wait till the curl has come out of your hair! Then some young rascal will pull you to pieces, Pull out your eyes that wore once blue and bright! Poor little doily, you're just like a woman, For when you are old you're considered a fright! $ W. 8. FORTET, Steam Printer and Publisher. * $ Qw\u00abt St Andrew Street, Seren Dud.. London.
