IT is well known, that Wycherly's Comedy of the Plain Dealer, was one of the molt celebrated productions of the laft century ; it acquired him the perfonal friendfhip of two of his fovereigns, and the praifes of the learned, both at home and abroad ; and certainly we find in it the happieft combination of wit, humour, character, and incident, that can be imagined. How then comes it to pafs, that it has been fo long excluded the Theatre ? I anfwer, to the honour of the prefent age, becaufe it was im moral and indecent. The licentioufnefs of Mr. Wycherly's Mule, rendered her fhocking to us, with all her charms : or, in other words, we could allow no charms in a tainted beauty, who brought contagion along with her. It was in this condition I found the play, which I now prefume to offer the public ; and, as before I undertook it, I mentioned it to -feveral good judges, who gave it over as ir- . recoverable,"], [8, "PREFACE. 6 recoverable, I fuppofed I had the right of other quacks, to try experiments upon it. Indeed, on a clofe examination, befides enormous length, and exceffive obfcenity, I thought I met with feveral things which called very much for correction ; a want of fymmetry might, I apprehend, be fometimes miftaken for ftrength. The character of Maniy was rough, even to outrageous brutality j and inconfiftent in his friendfhip for Free man, whom he knew to be guilty of the actions of a thief and a rafcal. The cha racters of lord Plaufible, and Novel, did not feem to me fo well contrafted as they might be, while the other comic perfonages degenerated fometimes into very low farce ; neither did I think the part of Fidelia fo amiable, or the jfituations arifing from her difguife, quite fo amufing, as they were capable of being render ed by a little retouching. ] There is but one thing I am afraid of, That in endeavouring to correct thefe, perhaps imaginary faults of the poet, I may have fubflituted real blemilhes of my own. But wherever I have taken the liberty to vary from my author, I have alfo taken care to mark it, in fuch a manuer, as that his reputation may luffer as little as pofiible, by a mixture which, I hope, will be confidered at worft as an alloy, without which, according to the rules of modern"], [9, "PREFACE. 7 modern refinement, his more valuable materials could never have been wrought up.
