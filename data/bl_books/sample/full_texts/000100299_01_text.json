The main object that has been kept in view in the preparation of this \" Hand-Book of American Cities\" has been to combine fullness and pre cision of information with the utmost attainable economy of space ; and to present the information in such a manner as to secure the greatest possible facility of consultation. Travelers who are accustomed to the profuseness and diffuseness of the ordinary guide-books may feel some natural distrust of a book which proposes to cover so wide a field in so small a compass ; but it is believed that practical trial will convince all who make it that the present work contains a larger amount and greater variety of that kind of information which is really useful to the tourist and sight-seer than many more voluminous and pretentious works. Its comparative smallness of dimension and consequent economy of price have been secured, not by omitting material facts, but by studiously excluding all supeifluous and unimportant matter, and by a rigid condensation of style. In order to make the book easy to consult at a moment's notice, a sys tem of classification has been adopted, intelligible at a glance and uniform throughout the volume. It will be seen at once that the field of search for any particular structure or place of interest is thus great!}7 narrowed -r and the quest is .urther facilitated by distinguishing the object described from the description of it and from the rest of the text, by putting it either in italics or in black letters. No mention is made of anything which is not thought worth the traveler's attention ; but there are degrees of attractive ness even among noteworthy things, and this it is attempted to indicate by the relative typographical prominence accorded them. The objects and places whose names are printed in black letters are thus a selection from a selection ; or, to put it dogmatically, they indicate what must be seen as distinguished from what may be seen when time and disposition are pro pitious. The illustrations follow the general line of the text, and have been selected with an eye rather to utility than to ornament. It is believed,. however, that, as a whole, they will afford an adequate and trustworthy idea of American city architecture, and, in a lesser degree, of American scenery and engineering achievements. Much care has been taken to make the Hand-Book accurate and fully up to date in its information ; but in dealing with so many and diverse facts it is probable that some errors have crept in, and that there are some omissions. The book will be kept standing in type and subjected to a thorough annual revision, and the editor will be grateful for any corrections or suggestions. Communications should be addressed to the Editor of Appletons' Hand-Book of American Cities, care of D. Appleton & Co., New York. ABBREVIATIONS.

Railway-faees, hotel-charges, etc., are, in most instances, given in the body of the Hand-Book, but a word or two may prove useful at the outset. The cost of traveling by rail in America is from two to three cents per mile, in the Middle and Eastern States ; it is somewhat higher South and West. Children under twelve years of age are generally charged half-price; those under five are passed free. Sleeping-coaches are run on all through-trains; from $2 to $3 per day (of 24 hours), in addition to the regular fare, is usually charged for them. The average speed on express trains is 30 miles an hour. Travel on steamboats is somewhat less expensive and less expeditious than by rail. The charge at first-class hotels throughout the United States is from $4 to $4.50 a day, though good accommodations may he had at houses of the second class ($2.50 to $3.50 a day). A reduction is usually made on board by the week. The cost of meals while traveling may be estimated at from $2 to $3 per day. The best hotels in the various cities are designated in their proper places in the body of the Hand- Book ; they are named in what the editor believes to be the order of their merit. Travelers from abroad will understand that the present currency in the United States, with the exception of California, consists of U. S. Treasury notes (called \"greenbacks\") and National Bank bills. All prices are understood to he in this paper, which is now at a discount for gold of from 12 to 15 per cent. In Califor- nia, gold and silver only are used. In Canada the currency is coin, or notes of the local banks, which are at par. It is the custom in America to deliver baggage to a person known as the hag- gage-master, who will give in return a \" check \" for every piece, on presentation of which the baggage is delivered. Baggage may he checked over long routes in this way, and the traveler, no matter how many times he changes cars or vehicles, has no concern about it. The companies are responsible if the baggage should be injured or lost, the check being evidence of delivery into their bands. The traveler should first procure his ticket at the ticket-office, and then, proceeding to the baggage-car, or proper station of the baggage-master, have his trunks checked. Arriving at his destination, the check may be handed to the hotel-porter, always in waiting, who will procure the various articles and have them sent to the hotel. It is not necessary to fee porters and waiters in the United States, as it fa in Europe, but the practice has some slight and irregular observance. The traveler is free to do as he pleases in the matter. In all large cities there are omnibuses at the station on the arrival of every train, which connect directly with the principal hotels. A small charge is made for this conveyance. As regards outfit, it is important for the traveler that he should be dressed with sufficient warmth. Our American climate is very changeable, and the traveler had better suffer at noonday from too much clothing than expose himself at night, in storms, or to sudden changes of temperature, with too little. One should wear woolen underclothing, both summer and winter, and always have a shawl or extra wrapper of some kind at hand. *+* In addition to the Hand-Book of Cities, the traveler will need a copy of Appletons' Railway Guide, published semi-monthly, with time-tables corrected to date ; price, twenty-five cents."], [23, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. NEW YORK CITY. New York from Brooklyn. \"VTEW YORK CITY, the commercial metropolis of the United States, and largest |\\ city of the Western Hemisphere, is situated at the mouth of the Hudson River on New York Bay, in latitude about 41\u00b0 N., and longitude 71\u00b0 W. It occupies the entire surface of Manhattan Ishmd ; Randall's, Ward's, and Blackwell's Islands in the East River; Bedloe's, Ellis's, and Governor's Islands in the Bay, occupied by the United States Government ; and a portion of the mainland north of Manhattan Island, and separated from it by Harlem River and Spuyten Duyvel Creek. Its ex treme length N. from the Battery is 10 m. ; greatest width, from the Hudson to the mouth of Bronx River, 4} m. ; area, nearly 4H sq. m, or 26,500 acres, of which 12,100 acres are on the mainland. Manhattan Island, on which the city proper stands, is 13J m. long, and varies in breadth from a few hundred yards to 24 m. having an area of nearly 22 sq. m., or 14,000 acres, to which the islands in the East River add 400 more. The older portion of the city below 14th St. is somewhat irregularly laid out. The plan of the upper part includes avenues running N. to the boundary'of the island, and streets running across them at right angles from river to river. The avenues are numbered from the E to 12th Avenue ; E. of the 1st Avenue in the widest part of the city are Avenues A, B, C, and D. Above 21st St., between 3d and 4th Avenues, is Lexington Avenue, and above 23d St., between 4th and 5th Avenues, Madison Avenue ; 6th and 7th Avenues are intersected by Central Park. The streets are numbered consecutively N. to 225th St., at the end of the island ; 21 blocks, including streets, average a mile. The numbers on the avenues runN.; those on the streets run E. and W. from 5th Avenue. The city is compactly built to Central Park, about 5 m. from the Battery, and on the E. side for the most part to Harlem, 34, m. farther. Manhattanville (8 m.), and Carmansville (10 m.) on the W. side, are populous villages. At Fort Washington and above are many handsome country residences. Distances are calculated from City Hall. The harbor of New York is one of the finest and most picturesque in the world. The outer bar is at Sandy Hook, 18 ra. from the Battery, and is crossed by two ship-channels, either of whicli admits vessels of the heaviest draught. As the steamer from abroad enters the Bay from the sea, and sails through the Narrows, between the villa-crowned shores of Staten and Long Islands, on the 1. are seen the massive battlements of Fort Richmond and Fort Tompkins; while opposite, on the Long 2"], [24, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 6 Island shore, are Fort Hamilton and old Fort Lafayette, the latter more famous as a political prison than as a fortress. Passing amid these imposing fortifications, the panorama of harbor and city is rapidly unfolded. To the 1. is Bedloe's Island, a mere bank holding a fort; another island fort (Ellis's Island) stands still farther toward the Jersey shore ; and to the r. is Governor's Island, with old Fort folnm bus. Directly ahead, the city opens majestically to the view, with Brooklyn on the r., and Jersey City on the 1. The authentic history of New York begins with the visit of Hendrick Hudson, an Englishman in the service of the Dutch East India Company, who arrived at the site of the present city, Sept. 3, 1609. He afterward ascended the river as far as the site of Albany, and claimed the land by right of discovery as an appanage of Holland. In 1614 a Dutch colony came over and began a settlement. At the close of that year the future metropolis consisted of a small fort (on the site of the present Bowling Green) and four houses, and was known as New Amsterdam. As late as 1648 it contained but 1,000 inhabitants. In 1664 it was surrendered to the British, and, passing into the hands of the Duke of York, was thenceforward called New York. In 1667 the city contained 384 houses. In 1700 the population had in creased to about 6,000. In 1696 Trinity Church was founded. In 1711 a slave market was established in Wall Street; and in 1725 the New York Gazette was started. The American army under Washington occupied the city in 1776 ; but after the battles of Long Island and Harlem Heights, it was captured by the British forces, and remained their headquarters for 7 years. The British troops evacuated the city Nov. 25, 1783. Within ten years after the War of Independence, New York had doubled its population. In 1807 the first steamboat was put on the Hudson ; the completion of the Erie Canal followed in 1825 ; and since that time the growth of the city has been rapid. Its population in 1800, was 60,489; it was 123,706 in 1820, 312,710 in 1840, 515,847 in 1850, 812,869 in 1860, and 942,377 in 1870. It is estimated that there are 1,500,000 persons in New York at noon on every secular day. Commerce and industry have kept pace with the population. In 1870 there arrived at this port 14,587 vessels from the American coast, and 4,688 from foreign ports. In 1874 the imports were $395,133,622, and the exports $354,699,732. More than half the foreign commerce of the United States is carried on through the customs district of which this is the port, and about two-thirds of the duties are here collected, the whole amount for the year ending June 30, 1874, being $160, 522,284.63, of which $109,549,790.79 was collected in the New York district. The manufactures of New York, though secondary in importance to its commercial and mercantile interests, are varied and extensive. In the value of products, according to the census of 1870, it is the first city in the Union, though surpassed by Phila delphia in the value of materials used, amount of capital invested, and number of establishments. The whole number of manufacturing establishments in 1870 was 7,624, employing 129,577 hands, and producing goods valued at $332,951,520. Hotels, Restaurants, and Clnbs. \u2014 Of the hotels conducted on the regular or American plan, the best are : the Windsor, a new and elegantly-appointed house, cor. 5th Ave nue and 46th St. ; the Fifth Avenue, an immense marble building in 5th Avenue fronting Madison Square; the St. Nicholas, another marble structure in Broadway between Spring and Prince Sts. ; the Metropolitan, a capacious brownstone building at Broadway and Prince St. ; the Grand Central, a lofty building on Broad way opposite Bond St. ; the New York, in Broadway between Washington Place and Waverley Place ; and the Sturtevant House, Broadway, 28th and 29th Sts. The prices at these range from $3.50 per day at the Grand Central and New York to $5 per day at the Windsor and Fifth Avenue. Of the hotels conducted on the Euro pean plan, among the best are: the Grand Hotel (cor. Broadway and 31st St.); the OiUey House (cor. Broadway and 29th St.) : the Hoffman House (cor.

The charges for rooms range from $1 to $3"], [25, "NEW YORK CITY. 7 per day, with meals d la carte in the house or elsewhere. Among the cheaper ho tels, frequented by business men, the more desirable are the Merchants', Western Cosmopolitan, French's, Leggett's, Sweeney's, and Parl, all situated in the lower portion of the city. There are upward of 150 other hotels of all grades ; and board and lodging may be obtained at boarding-houses in all parts of the city at from $8 to $15 per week, for which consult advertisements in New York Herald. There are numerous restaurants in all the principal streets. Debnonico's, cor. 5th Avenue and 14th St., is one of the best dining-places in the world, and is famous for its elaborate dinners. The Cafe. Brunswick, cor. 26th St. and 5th Avenue ; the Hoffman Home, cor. 24th St. and Broadway; Iauch's, 864 Broadway; Clark's, cor. Broadway and 13th St. ; Bigot's, 14th St., Onion Square ; St. Denis, cor. Broad way and 11th St.; and the Metropolitan, cor. Broadway and Prince, are all of excellent repute, and places where ladies or families may dine. Delmonico's, at 112 and 114 Broadway, near Equitable building; Mouquin's, Ann St., near Nassau St. ; and the Astor House, are first-class restaurants for gentlemen. There are a number of restaurants where excellent table-d'hote dinners may be got from 5 to 6 p. m., for from 75 c. to $1, the latter price usually including wine ; of these we may mention Phillippe's, 19 University Place ; Jacques's, 54 W. 11th St. ; University Hotel, Univer sity Place\u2014 all near Broadway. There are English chop-houses, so called, where a first-rate grill may be obtained, of which \" Old Tom's,\" Thames St. (near rear of Trinity Church), Farrish's, 64 John St., Black's (Manhattan Lunch), 493 Broadway, and the De Soto, Bleecker St., just E. of Broadway, are noted. The most prominent city Clubs are the Century, 109 E. 15th St. ; the Knicker locker, 249 5th A,venue; the Manhattan, 96 5th Avenue; the Union League, cor. Madison Avenue and E. 26th St. ; the Travelers', 222 5th Avenue ; the Union, cor. 5th Avenue and W. 21st St.; the Germanic, W. 42d St. ; and the Lotos, in Irving Place. Admission to these is obtained only by introduction by a member. Depots.\u2014 The Grand Central Depot, in 42d St., between 4th and Madison Ave- Grcind Central Depot. nues, is the largest and finest in the country, and is used by most passenger-trains of the New York Central and Hudson R. R., and by the New York and Harlem and New York and New Haven Railroads. It is built ot brick, stone, and iron, and cost nearly $2,250,000. It is 692 ft. long, and 240 ft. wide, and is surmounted"], [26, "8 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. by several Louvre domes. It covers 664, city lots, and, besides containing waiting and baggage rooms and offices, admits 150 cars. The depot of the Pennsylvania. P. R. is reached by ferries from foot of Desbrosses and Cortlandt Sts. ; the Erie from foot of Chambers and of 23d Sts.; the Midland, same as Pennsylvania; the Morris & Essex from Barclay and Christopher Sts. ; the Jersey Central from foot of Liberty St. ; the Long Island and the South Side from James Slip and foot of 34th St. ; and the Flushing from James Slip. Modes of Conveyance. \u2014 Within the city proper are omnibuses, hackney and livery coaches, horse-cars, and, to the more remote portions, steam-cars. The hackney coaches have stands in different parts of the city, and attend the arrival of every train and steamboat. A tariff of fares is or ought to be hung in each carriage, but the drivers frequently try to practise extortion. In such cases, appeal should be made to the first policeman who may be seen. Disputed questions as to time, dis tance, or price, must be settled at the Mayor's office (City Hall). The legal rates are, for 1 passenger for a distance of 1 mile or less, 50 c. ; for 1 passenger for more than 1 m. and less than 2 m., 75 c. ; for each additional passenger, 37.V c. ; by the hour, stopping as often as may be required, $1. Children between 2 and 14 years of age pay half-price. The principal hotels have carriages in waiting for the use of guests ; the rates are higher than those of the public carriages. The omnibuses start from South, Wall St., and Fulton Ferries, running up Broadway as far as 23d St., whence one line diverges W. to Hudson Ii. R. station at 30th St. and 9th Ave nue ; another up Madison Avenue to Grand Central Depot ; another up 5th Ave nue. Fare, 10 c. The principal horse-car lines start from the vicinity of the Astor House, and traverse the city from end to end. Besides these, there are several cross-town lines running from river to river. Fare on most of the lines, 5 c. The Elevated Railway runs from the Battery to Central Park at 59th St. The track is supported by iron pillars, and the cars are luxurious, and drawn by small locomo tives. Fare, 10 c. Numerous ferries connect New York with Brooklyn, Jersey City, and adjacent towns and villages. (See Brooklyn.) Streets, Avenues, and Drives. \u2014 Broadway is the great central thoroughfare of the city. It is 80 ft. wide, and upon it are most of the principal hotels, banks, insurance offices, and great retail stores. It runs N. from the Battery, bending toward the W. above 10th St., and after crossing 5th, 6th, and 7th Avenues, terminates at 59th St. and 8th Avenue. Wall Street, less than half a mile long, running from Broadway opposite Trinity Church to the East River, is the monetary centre of the country. It contains the custom-house, United States sub-treasury and assay office, and many of the principal banks and banking firms, housed in large and handsome buildings. On the E. side of tbe city the principal thoroughfare is the Bowery, a very wide street, with its continuation, 3d Avenue ; and on the W. side Hudson Street and 8th Avenue. Fifth Avenue is the favorite promenade; it contains many fine churches, but is chiefly noted for its handsome private residences, to which it is almost exclu sively devoted. Madison Avenue is scarcely inferior in the elegance of its build ings, and nearly all the cross-streets from 23d to 42d St. present fine examples of the prevailing domestic architecture. Park Avenne (which includes that part of 4th Avenue lying between 34th and 40th Sts.) is 140 ft. wide, is bordered by handsome residences, and is diwded in the centre by a row of beautiful little parks, surround ing the openings of the railroad-tunnel. The favorite drives outside of Central Park are the Boulevard, St. Nicholas AvcDue, and 6th and 7th Avenues above the park. The Boulevard commences at 59th St. and 8th Avenue, and terminates at 155th St., following for the most part the line of the old Bloomingdale Road, the continuation of Broadway, and coinciding above 107th St. with 11th Avenue; it is 150 ft. wide, and below 128th St. is divided in the centre by a series of little parks. St. Nicholas Avenne, 100 ft. wide, runs diagonally along the former Harlem Lane from the upper side of Central Park at 6th Avenue and 110th St. to 155th St., whence its continuation is the Kingsbridge Road. Objects of Antiquarian Interest.\u2014 Standing on the sea-verge of the Battery is a curious round structure which is now known as Castle Garden, but which was originally built in 1807 as a fortress (\" Castle Clintcn \"). It was ceded to the city"], [27, "NEW YORK CITY. 9 in 1823, and was the scene of the civic receptions of the Marquis de Lafayette, Gen eral Jackson, President Tyler, and others. Subsequently it became an opera-house, and here Jenny Lind, Sontag, Mario, etc., made their appearance. The building is now used as a depot for immigrants, and is the chief receiving and distributing res ervoir of the great tide of immigration from Europe. Bowling Green, the cradle of New York, is just N. of the Battery ; in the times of the Dutch it was the court end of the town, and was surrounded by the best houses. The row of six buildings facing the Green on the S. cover the site of the old Dutch and English forts. The Kennedy House, No. 1 Broadway, named after the Hon. Archibald Kennedy, then collector of the port, who built it in 1760, is one of the most interesting relics now left standing. In colonial times it was the heart of the highest fashion in the colony, having been successively the residence and headquarters of Lords Corn wallis and Howe, General (Sir Henry) Clinton, and General Washington ; Talleyrand also lived there during his stay in this country. Arnold occupied No. 5 Broadway, and in Clinton's headquarters his treasonable projects were concerted. Fulton died in a room in the present Washington Hotel, No. 1 Marketfield St. It was then (1815) used as a boarding-house. Washington's farewell interview with his officers took place at France's Tavern, cor. of Pearl and Broad Sts., long since removed. Where the Mechanics' Bank now stands, S. side of Wall St., between Broad and William Sts., Hamilton wrote the \"Federalist.\" The old Walton House, No. 326 Pearl St., erected by Walton in 1754, is one of the few old structures remaining in the city. The old churches, etc., are spoken of elsewhere. Post-Office. Public and Prominent Buildings. \u2014 Occupying the southern extremity of City Hall Park, opposite the Astor House, is the new Po>t-Office, an imposing building of Doric and Renaissance architecture, four stories high, besides a Mansard roof, and surmounted by several Louvre domes, with a front of 279 ft. toward the Park, and of 144 ft. toward the S., and two equal facades of 262i ft. on Broadway and Park"], [28, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 10 Row.

The City Hall, in the Park, N. of the Post-Office, is a hand some structure in the Italian style, three stories high, with front and ends of white marble, and rear of brownstone. It is 216 ft. long by 105 ft. deep, with Ionic, Corinthian, and composite pilasters lining its front, and .surmounted by a cupola containing a four-dial clock, which is illuminated at night by gas. It was erected from 1803 to 1812, at a cost of more than $500,000, and is occupied by the Mayor, Common Council, and other public officers. The Governor's Room, in the second story, contains the writing-desk on which Washington wrote his first message to Congress, the chairs used by the first Congress, the chair in which Washington was inaugurated first President, and a number of portraits of American worthies, mostly by eminent artists. It has also a very fine portrait of Columbus. N. of the City Hall is the new Court-House, which was commenced in 1861, and has been occupied since 1867, but it is not yet completed.

The main entrance on Chambers St. is reached by a flight of 30 broad steps, which are ornamented with massive marble columns. The cost of the building and furniture was over $12,000,000, the result of the notorious \"Ring frauds,\" of which it was the instrument. The Tombs is a granite prison occupying the entire block bounded by Centre, Leonard, Elm, and Franklin Sts. It is pure Egyptian in architecture, and the entrance on Centre St. is imposing if gloomy. Another building in the Egyptian style is the Distributing Reservoir of the Croton Aqueduct, 5th Avenue, 40th to 42d St. The Cnstom-Honse, Wall St., cor. William, was built in 1835 as the Merchants' Exchange, and is famous for the great granite plinths of the columns that support the pediment of the front elevation. It has a depth of 200 ft., a frontage of 144 ft., and a rear breadth of 171 ft. Its height to the top of the central dome is 124 ft. Beneath this dome, in the interior of the building, is the Rotunda, around the sides of which are eight lofty col umns of Italian marble, the superb Corinthian capi tals of which were carved in Italy. They support the base of the dome, and are probably the largest and no- Custom-House. blest marble columns in the country. The U. S. Sub-Treasury, formerly the Cus tom-House, is a white-marble building at the cor. of Wall and Nassau Sts. It is a fine specimen of Doric architecture, and is 200 ft. long, 80 ft. wide, and 80 ft. high. The main entrance on Wall St. is reached by a flight of 18 marble steps, and in the interior is a Rotunda 60 ft. in diameter, and surrounded by 16 Corinthian columns.

Just opposite is the handsome"], [29, "NEW YORK CITY. 11 Drexel Building, in the Renaissance style, and a little farther S. on Broad St. are the Stock Exchange and Gold Room. The Corn Exchange, located at the upper end of Whitehall St., is a handsome brick building. Commencing at Wall St. (whither our visit to the Sub-Treasury, etc., has brought us) a saunter up Broadway, the building of the Equitable Life Insurance Co., at the corner of Cedar St., first attracts attention. It is of granite, in mingled Doric and Renaissance style, and is probably the most solid and substantial structure in the city. It has a frontage of 87 ft., a depth of 200, and a height of 137. Just above, at the corner of Liberty St., is the six-story building of the American Bank Note Co., surmounted by a tower containing a clock ; and on the other side of Broadway, at the corner of Dey St., is the new building of the Western Union Telegraph Co., ten stories high (including three in the roof), with a clock-tower 230 ft. high.

At the cor. of Chambers St., on Broadway, is the great marble building devoted to A. T. Stewart's wholesale trade; it stands on the site of one of the principal forts erected by the British for the defense of the city during the Revolution. Farther up, on the cor. of Leonard St., is the beautiful building of the New York Life Insurance Co., of pure white marble, in the Ionic style ; and opposite is the fine building of the Globe Mutual Life Insurance Co. Crossing Canal St., once the bed of a rivulet, a succession of handsome buildings present themselves on either side of the way, among them the St. Nicholas and Metropolitan Hotels, previously mentioned, and the publishing-house of D. Appleton & Co. At the cor. of Bond St. is the handsome building of Brooks Brothers, of red brick trimmed with light-colored stone; and a little to the E., on Bond St., stands the American Watch Company's building. Stewart's Retail Store is of iron painted white, is five stories high, and occupies the entire block between 9th and 10th Sts. and Broadway and 4th Avenue. The interior is tastefully decorated.

Well worth visiting, especially on Saturday morning, is Washington Market, at the foot of Fulton St., on the Hudson River. Externals, it is a collection of unsightly sheds, but"], [30, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 12 within it presents an unequaled display of fruits, vegetables, meats, and fish, and every variety! of market produce. Manhattan Market, at the foot of 34th St., North River, is one of the largest structures of the kind in the world.

It has 18 entrances (4 at each end and 5 at each side), and four streets (65th, 79th, 85tb, and 97th) cross it, to afford opportunity for traffic, passing under the park walks and drives. The original sur face was exceedingly rough and unattractive, consisting chiefly of rock and marsh ; but by engineering skill the very defects that once seemed fatal have been converted into its most attractive features. Between 79th and 96th streets a. large portion of the Park is occupied by the two Croton reservoirs, the smaller one comprising 35 and the larger 107 acres. The Lakes, five in number, occupy 43\u00a3 acres more. There are 10 m. of carriage-roads, 6 m. of bridle-paths, and 30 m. of foot-paths, with numerous bridges, arches, and other architectural monuments, together with many statues. The Mall, near the 5th Avenue entrance, is the principal prome nade ; it is a magnificent esplanade, nearly a quarter of a mile long and bordered by double rows of stately elms. At the lower end are fine bronze statues of Shakspeare and Scott, and in the Music Pavilion near the upper end concerts are given on Satur day afternoons in summer. The Mall is terminated by The Terrace, a sumptuous pile of masonry richly carved and decorated. Descending the Terrace by a flight of broad stone stairs, Central Lake is reached, the prettiest piece of water in the Park. Between the Terrace and the Lake is the costliest fountain on the continent, with immense granite basins and a colossal statue of the Angel of Bethesda. The Ramble, covering 36 acres of sloping hills, and abounding in pleasant shady paths, extends from the Lake to the Old Reservoir. On the highest point of the Ramble stands the Belvedere, a massive piece of architecture in the Norman style. The tower commands attractive views in all directions. In the upper Park are the ruins of redoubts used in the Revolutionary War, guarding McGowan's Pass, where there was some sharp fighting. A large restaurant is located in the building formerly occupied by the Convent of the Sisters of Charity ; and the Chapel contains 87 casts from the statuary of Crawford. The American Museum of Natural History occu pies the old State Arsenal, a castellated structure near the 5th Avenue entrance.

Anew building for the Museum is now nearly completed in Manhattan Square. \u2014 Park car riages, so constructed as to afford every passenger a good view, run from 5th and 8th Avenue entrances to the principal points of interest (fare 25c). Coaches may be hired for $2 per hour, and the circuit can be made in an hour. Mount Morris Square is on the line of 5th Avenue between 120th and 124th Sts., and embraces 20 acres. In the centre rises a rocky hill, 101 ft. high, com manding picturesque views. The level portion has been handsomely laid out, and walks lead up to the summit of the hill. Madison Square is 6^ acres in extent, and lies between 23d and 26th Sts. and 5th and Madison Avenues. It is one of the most fashionable squares in the city, is tastefully laid out, and is surrounded by fine buildings. On the W. side, at the junction of Broadway and 5th Avenue, is a monument to General Worth. Union Square, 3^ acres in extent, is of oval shape, and lies between 14th and 17th Sts. and Broadway and 4th Avenue. It is filled with trees, and has a handsome fountain in the centre. At its lower end on the E. is the bronze equestrian statue of Washington by H. K. Browne ; and on the W. is a bronze statue of Lincoln. The Battery, at the S. extremity ot the city, looking"], [37, "NEW YORK CITY'. 19 out upon the Bay, embraces 21 acres, and is beautifully laid out and protected by a massive granite sea-wall. It was the site of a fort in the early years of the city, and later was surrounded by the residences of the wealthy. The City Hall Park, comprising 8J acres, is little more than a reservation for public buildings. At its lower end is a fine fountain. The principal other parks are Washington Square (8 acres), reached by going W. from Broadway on 4th St. or Waverley Place; Stuyvesant Square (4\u00a3 acres) between 15th and 16th Sts., and divided by 2d Avenue into two distinct parks; Gramercy Park, on 20th St. near 4th Avenue; Tompkins Square (lOi acres), between Avenues A and B and 7th and 10th Sts., used as a parade ground ; and Reservoir Park (4J acres), in rear of the Distributing Reservoir on 5th Avenue. Suburb'-. \u2014 No one engaged in \" doing \" New York should fail to visit High Bridge (reached by small steamer from Harlem, by Harlem River R. R. from Grand Cen tral Depot, or by carriage-drive through Central Park). This magnificent structure, by which the Croton Aqueduct is carried across the Harlem River, is of granite throughout, and spans the entire width of valley and river, from cliff to cliff. It is 1,450 ft. long, 114 ft. high, and supported on 14 massive piers. On the lofty bank at its S. end is a capacious reservoir for the supply of the upper portions of the city, the water being pumped into it by powerful machinery. From this point a comprehensive view of the city and surroundings may be had. A little below High Bridge, most picturesquely situated on Hudson River, is the old Morris Mansion, once the headquarters of Washington, and late the property of Madame Jumel. Jerome Park is a fashionable race-course in Westchester County near the Harlem River (reached by private conveyance or by Harlem R. R.). Hoboken and Weehawken are pleasant summer resorts on the Hudson River, opposite the city. The Elysian Fields are in Hoboken, and it was at Weehawken that Burr killed Hamilton. Rockaway Beach and Coney Island are on the seashore just outside the harbor, and afford excellent bathing (reached by steamer or by steam-cars from Brooklyn). Staten Island, the largest in the harbor, is reached by ferry-boats (which run hourly) from pier at E. side of Battery to New Brighton, Port Richmond, and Elm Park ; and from adjoining pier to Tompkinsville, Staple ton, and Clifton (fare 10c). The sail down the Bay is extremely pleasant in sum mer, and the island offers beautiful scenery. The drives about the upper part are particularly attractive, and there are broad views from the heights over harbor and ocean. Fort Richmond is a mile S. E. of Clifton Landing. Governor's Island, op posite the Battery, will repay a visit. It contains two powerful forts (Fort Colum bus and Castle William) and a United States Arsenal, and the grounds are beauti fully kept. Access is secured by the government steamer, which makes two trips a day from Whitehall pier, or by small boats which can be hired at the same point. The islands in East River and other points of interest may be seen by taking a steamer at Peck Slip for Glen Cove, L. I., or for Harlem. Opposite the foot of E. 46th St. is Blackwell's Island, 120 acres in extent ; upon it are located the alms house, lunatic asylum (for females), penitentiary, workhouse, blind asylum, charity, small-pox, and typhus-fever hospitals, hospital for incurables, and convalescent hos pital, all built of granite quarried on the island by the convicts. The boat now passes along the W. verge of Hell- Gate, long the terror of all vessels entering or leaving the harbor by way of Long Island Sound. It is a collection of rocks in the channel, which offer so much resistance to the tides as to cause a succession of whirlpools and rapids. Of late years the Gate has been shorn of most of its dan gers, and the U. S. Engineers are preparing to blow the remaining rocks into the ah. Ward's Island (200 acres) divides the Harlem from the East River. Upon it are the emigrant hospital, the lunatic asylum (for males), and the inebriate asylum, the latter a large and imposing building. Randall's Island, the last of the group, is separated from Ward's Island by a narrow channel. It is the site of the idiot asy lum, the nursery, the House of Refuge, hospitals, schools, and other charities pro vided by the city for destitute children. No one is allowed to visit any ot these islands without permits, which may be procured at the office of the Commissioners of Public Charities, cor. 3d Avenue and 11th St. See trip up the Hudson River."], [38, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 20 BROOKLYN. BROOKLYN, the third largest city in the United States, lies just across East River from New Y'ork, at the W. end of Long Island, and is reached by sev eral ferries, the principal of which are Fulton Ferry, South Ferry (at foot of Broad wav), and Wall St. Ferry. The extreme length of the city from N. to S. is 7f m., and its average breadth 34, m., embracing an area of 20.84 sq. m. The surface is elevated and diversified. Brooklyn was settled in 1625, near Wallabout Bay, by a band of Walloons, and during the Revolutionary War was the scene of events that give great interest to some of its localities. On the Heights, back of the city, the battle of Long Island (August 26, 1776) was fought, and the Americans defeated with a loss of 2,000 out of 5,000 men. The population, which was 3,298 in 1800, had increased in 1870 to 396,099. Hotels and Restaurants. \u2014 The hotels are few in number, the principal ones being the Pierrepont House ($4 a day), cor. Montague and Hicks Sts.; and the Mansion House, 117 Hicks St. The leading restaurants are Snedeker's, 187 Montague St., and Dieter's, 303 Washington St. Modes of Conveyance. \u2014 The horse-cars afford means of conveyance to all parts of the city. All the lines either start from, or connect with, Fulton Ferry (fare 5c). Hackney-coaches are usually in wailing at the principal ferries. Streets and Drives. \u2014 The main business thoroughfare is Fulton St., extending about 5 m. from Fulton Ferry to East New York. Extending from South Ferry to East New York, parallel with Fulton St., is Atlantic Avenue, an active business street in its lower part, and in its upper shaded by double rows of trees. Clinton Avenue is the handsomest street in the city, and is lined with beautiful residences surrounded with extensive ornamental grounds. St. Mark's Place, in South Brooklyn, is scarcely less attractive. Remsen and Montague Streets contain many fine resi dences; from Montague Terrace, on the latter, is obtained a magnificent view of New York City and harbor. The favorite drive is through Prospect Park to the Ocean Parkway, a boulevard 200 ft. wide, extending from the S. W. corner of the park to the seashore at Coney Island (3 m.). The Eastern Parkway, also a popular drive, extends from the park entrance to East New York (2| m.). Other boulevards are designed to connect the park with Fort Hamilton, Bath, and Sheeps head Bay, all of which are popular resorts. Public and Prominent Bnildings. \u2014 The Post-Office is on Washington St. N. of Fulton. The City Hall, at the junction of Fulton, Court, and Joralemon Sts., 1 m. from ferry, is of white marble, in the Ionic style, 162 ft. wide and 102 ft. deep, and sur- mounted by a tower, with belfry and four-dial clock.

Luqueer St. Miscellaneous Points of Interest. \u2014 The United States Navy Yard (reached by horse cars from Fulton Ferry), on the S. shore of Wallabout Bay, is the chief naval station of the Republic. It occupies 45 acres of ground, inclosed by a high brick wall, and contains numerous founderies, workshops, and storehouses. Representative vessels of every kind used in the Navy may usually be seen at the Yard, while the trophies and relics preserved here are of great interest. The Dry Dock, one of the most remarkable structures of the kind in the world, is of massive granite, and cost $2,113,173. It holds 610,000 galls, of water, and can be emptied by steam-pumps in 4J- hours. Half a mile E. of the Navy Yard, on the other side of the Wallabout, is the Marine Hospital, a handsome granite building located in the midst of extensive grounds. It can accommodate 500 patients. The Atlantic Dock is at the other end of the city, and about 1 m. below the South Ferry, within what is called Red Hook Point. It is a very extensive work, and merits the attention of strangers. Atlantic Dock. The basin has an area of 42J- acre*, and sufficient depth of water to accommodate the largest ships ; the total wharfage is about 2 m. The piers are of solid granite ; and surrounding the basin on all sides, except an entrance 200 ft. wide for vessels, are substantial brick and granite warehouses. In crossing 'Fulton Ferry to or from"], [40, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 22 New York, the massive towers of the Bridge are conspicuous objects. The tower on the Brooklyn side is finished, that on the New York side nearly so ; their height above high water is 268 ft. The bridge itself will be 6,000 ft. long, and the central span across the river from tower to tower 1,595 ft. long. It will be 85 ft. wide, in cluding a promenade of 13 ft., two railroad-tracks, and four wagon or horse-car tracks. From high-water mark to the floor of the bridge in the centre will be a distance of 135 ft., so that navigation will not be impeded. The approach on the Brooklyn side from the terminus to the anchorage will measure 836 ft. ; on the New York side 1,336 ft. The bridge is to be completed in 1877, and will have cost about $10,000,000. Prospect Park (reached by several lines of cars from Fulton Ferry) is one of the most beautiful in America. It contains 550 acres, is situated on an elevated ridge, and commands a magnificent view of the two cities, of the inner and outer harbor, Long Island, the Jersey shore, and the Atlantic It is beautifully shaded in many parts by old woods which have been skillfully improved, and its combination of broad meadows and wooded hills is unequaled elsewhere. It contains 8 m. ot drives, 4 m. of bridle-paths, and 11 m. of walks. The Lake covers 61 acres, and through the Glen flows a charming brooklet, broken here and there into cascades. The main entrance on Flatbush Ave., known as the Plaza, is paved with Belgian pavement, and bordered by grassy mounds ; in the centre are a fine fountain and a bronze statue of President Lincoln. The Parade and Zoological Garden are on the W. side of the park ; the Dairy is about \\ m. S. E. of the Plaza ; and an observatory 100 ft. high stands on Lookout Hill. Park carriages, starting from the entrance, make the circuit of most points of interest (fare 25c). Washington Park (30 acres) is an elevated plateau E. of City Hall, between Myrtle and De Kaib Avenues. Dur ing the Revolutionary War it was the site of extensive fortifications, of which Fort Greene was the principal. It commands an extensive view, and is surrounded by a handsome stone wall. Greenwood Cemetery (reached by cars from Fulton Ferry), the most beautiful in the world, is situ ated on Gow anus heights in the S. portion of the city. It contain s 413 acres, skillfully laid out, and 178,000 inter ments have been made in it since its opening in 184 2. The main entrance, near 5th Ave. and 23d St., is a highly orna mented struct ure of brown stone, monu mental in form, in the middle pointed Goth ic style, 132 ft. long and 40 ft. deep, the cen- Entrance to Greenwood Cemetery. tral pinnacle being 106 ft. high. It is ornamented with sculptures representing scenes from the Gospels, chief of which are the Entombment and Resurrection of"], [41, "PHILADELPHIA. 23 Christ. The grounds have a varied surface of hill, valley, and plain, and are trav ersed by 17 m. of carriage-roads and 15 m. of foot-paths. The elevations afford extensive views. There are many beautiful monuments, chief among which are the Pilots' and Firemen's, Charlotte Canda's, and that to the \" mad poet \" McDonald Clark. By keeping in the main avenue called The Tour, as indicated by finger posts, visitors will obtain the best general view of the cemetery, and will be able to regain the entrance without difficulty. About 4 m. E. of Greenwood are the cemeteries of the Evergreens and Cypress Hills. NEW YORK TO PHILADELPHIA. ( Ra Pennsylvania R. R. Distance, 90 m. Time, 3 to 4 hrs. Fare, $2.75.) The station in Jersey City is reached by ferries from foot of Desbrosses and Cortlandt Streets. The route is through a flat and featureless country, and would be monotonous but for the numerous cities and towns along the line. Newark (9 m.) contains 100,000 inhabitants, and is a large manufacturing centre, but offers few attractions to the tourist, Elisabeth (15 in.) is the handsomest city in New Jersey, and contains many fine residences, a few of which are visible from the cars. New Brunswick (32 m.) is an old town at the head of navigation on Raritan River; and Princeton (48 m.) is noted as the seat of Princeton College, one of the oldest and most famous educational institutions in the country. Trenton (58 m.) is pleasantly situated at the head of navigation on the Delaware, and contains some fine public buildings. Here Washington won his famous victory over the Hessians, Dec. 26, 1776. PHILADELPHIA PHILADELPHIA, the largest city as to area in the United States, and the second in population, lies between the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, 6 m. above their junction and 96 from the Atlantic. Its precise latitude is 39\u00b0 57' N. and longitude 75\u00b0 10' W. It is 22 m. long from N. to S., with a breadth of 5 to 8 in., and an area of 129.4 sq. m. The city, as originally incorporated, was bounded by the rivers Dela ware and Schuylkill and Vine and South Streets, and this area was not enlarged until 1854, when the corporation was extended over the entire county. Within its present area there are over 350 m. of paved streets, and more buildings than in any other city in the country. The city is regularly laid out, the N. and S. streets being numbered in succession from the Delaware to the Schuylkill, which is reached at 23d St., the first street W. of that being 30th. These are crossed at right angles by named streets. A few irregular avenues, formerly country-roads, stretch away from the original town-plot. The houses on the streets running E. and W. are numbered toward the west, all between 1st and 2d streets being between 100 and 200, and all between 2d and 3d streets between 200 and 300, and so on ; so that the number of the house indicates the number of the street as well. Thus if the nearest house be 836, Eighth St. is E. and 9th St. W. In like manner, the streets running N. and S. are allowed 100 numbers for every square they are distant from Market St., either N. or S. This plan is very convenient in going about the city, as whenever one can see a number he can calculate his exact distance from Market St. or the Delaware. Philadelphia was founded by William Penn, who came over from England in 1682, accompanied by a colony of Quakers, and purchased the site from the Indians. The emigration thither was very rapid, and in 1684 the population was estimated at 2,500. Penn presented the city with a charter in 1701. It prospered greatly, and was the most important city in the country during the colonial period and for more than a quarter of a century after the Revolution. The first Congress assembled here, as did also the subsequent Congresses during the continuance of the war. The Declaration of Independence was signed and issued here, July 4, 1776. The con vention which formed the Constitution of the Republic assembled here in May, 1787. Here resided the first President of the United States, and here Congress continued"], [42, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 24 to meet until 1787. The city was in possession of the British from September, 1777, to June, 1778, a result of the unfortunate battles of Brandy wine and Germantown. Since the Revolution the city has grown steadily and rapidly. The population, which in 1800 was 41,220, had increased to 121,376 in 1850, to 565,529 in 1860, and to 674,022 in 1874. The commerce of Philadelphia is large and increasing, but manufactures are its chief source of wealth, and in these,- according to the census of 1870, it is the first city of the Union, surpassing New York in the number of establishments (8,184), in the number of hands employed (137,496), and in the amount of capital invested ($174,016,674). The products of the year 1870 were valued at $322,004,517. Hotels, Restaurants, and Clnbs. \u2014 The Continental, Chestnut St. cor. 9th St., is an excellent hotel with a front (of Pictou sandstone) 200 ft. long and six stories high ($4.50 per day).. The Girard House, opposite on Chestnut St., is a handsome build ing ($3.50). The Colonnade, Chestnut St. cor. 15th ($3.00), and the La Pierre, Broad cor. Chestnut St. ($3.50 per day), are up-town. The Bingham, cor. 11th and Market Sts., and the American, Chestnut St. near 5th, are much patronized by merchants ($3.00 per day). The St. Cloud ($3.00 a day) is in Arch St. between 7th and 8th ; the St. Elmo ($2.50 a day), Arch St. near 3d; the Central ($2.00 a day), Arch St. below 7th ; and the Ridgway ($2.00 a day) at the foot of Market St. Guy's, cor. Chestnut and 7th, is on the European plan. Excellent boarding-houses may be obtained in all parts of the city ($6 to $12 per week). \u2014 In preparation for visitors to the Centennial Exposition several new hotels have been put up in different parts of the city. The Globe Hotel is a vast building directly adjoining the entrance to the Exposition grounds; and the Transcontinental, on a smaller scale, is opposite. The United States Hotel is an immense building, cor. Columbia Ave. and 42d St., one block from the entrance. The \" Centennial Lodging-House Agency \" has made special arrangements with the proprietors of boarding-houses and private residences, and undertakes to provide \" rooms furnished equal to those of any hotel in the city, with 2 meals of superior quality, at daily prices of about one-half those charged by hotels.\" Its \" coupons '* will be on sale at the principal railway-offices throughout the country, and the purchaser will be met on the train by a messenger who will locate him in one of the rooms at the disposal of the Agency. The best restaurants are the Continental Hotel Cafe, Chestnut St. near 9th ; Green's, 731 Chestnut St. near 7th; the International, 1220 Chestnut St.; and Ashe's, 1027 Chestnut St. Good lunch-rooms and chop-houses may be found in the lower part of the city, in the neighborhood of Third St. The Union League Club owns a handsome building cor. Broad and Sansom streets ; it is of brick in the French Renaissance style, with facades of granite, brick, and brown-stone. It contains the best refectory in the city, a reading-room, paint ings, statuary, etc. A member's introduction and tickets will secure the visitor the privileges of the club for one month.

Bread St., the central street N. and S., is 113 ft. wide, and is lined with churches and elegant pri vate residences. Each of these streets is built up continuously for about 4 m. Chestnut St., parallel with Market on the S., is the fashionable promenade, containing the finest hotels and retail stores. Lombard, farther S., and Arch, Race, and Vine, N. of Market, are leading and wealthy streets. Third St. is the banking and finan cial centre. The principal drives are through Fairmount Park, and out Broad St. toward Germantown. Objects of Antiquarian Interest. \u2014 Philadelphia is peculiarly rich in relics of its early history. The oldest of these is the Old Swedes' Church (in Swanson St., below Christian), which was built in 1700, to take the place of a log structure erected in 1677. It is of brick, and is still regularly used. Surrounding the church is a ceme tery, in which gravestones dating from 1700 may be seen. Penn's Cottage, a little two-story brick house, stands on Letitia St., a few doors S. of Market; it was built for Penn before his arrival in the settlement, and curiously enough has withstood the march of improvement that has swept away so many more pretentious structures. A few steps from this, on the S. W. cor. of Front and Market Streets, stands a small brick house, now used as a tobacco-shop ; a hundred years ago it was the celebrated \"London Coffee-House,\" frequented by the magnates of the city. It was built in 1702. Treaty Monument, a simple obelisk upon a granite pedestal, cor. Beach and Hanover streets (Kensington), marks the site of the old elm-tree under which Penn made his memorable treaty with the Indians. The tree was blown down in 1810. Christ Church (Episcopal), in 2d St., near Market, was begun in 1727. anil is still a fine building and in perfect preservation. Its steeple is 196 ft. high, and contains the oldest chime of bells in America. Two services are held in the church on Sun- day, and it is open for prayers on Wednesdays and Fridays, at 11 a.m., at which times it may be visited. On the S. side of Chestnut St., between 3d and 4th, a nar row court leads to Carpen ter's Hall, where assembled the first Congress of the United Colonies. It is a plain two-story brick build ing, surmounted by a cupola. The most interesting object in Philadelphia is Indepen dence Hall, in Chestnut St., between 5th and 6th. It was commenced in 1729 and completed in 1735, at a cost of \u00a35,600. In the E. room (Independence Hall proper) the Continental Congress met, and here on the 4th of July, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was adopt ed and publicly proclaimed from the steps on the same day. The room presents the same appearance now as it did at that time ; the furniture is that used by Congress, there are a statue of Washington, numerous portraits and pictures, and many curious Revolution-"], [44, "26 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. ary relics. Here also is preserved the old \"Liberty Bell,\" the first bell rung in the United States after the passage of the Declaration. In Congress Hall, in the second story, Washington delivered his farewell address. Visitors are admitted between 9 a. m. and 4 p. M. daily. The Superintendent will, on application, furnish tickets admitting the bearers to the steeple, from which a fine panoramic view of the city may be had. On the sidewalk in front of the Hall stands Bailley's statue of Washington. Hultzheimer's New House, where Jefferson penned the Declaration of Independence, is still standing at the S. W. corner of Market and 7th Streets. Franklin's Grave is at the S. E. corner of Arch and 5th streets. Iron railings have been substituted for the brick wall of the cemetery opposite the grave, so that the visitor may look in. No. 239 Arch St. is noticeable as the place where the first American flag was made. Pnblic and Prominent Bnildings. \u2014 The Post- Off ce, a plain white marble building, is in Chestnut St. below 5th. A very large new building for this purpose is in pro cess of construction at the cor. of 9th and Chestnut Streets. It is to be of granite in the French Renaissance style, four stories high, with an iron dome. The new Public Buildings (for law-courts and public offices) is being erected on what was once Penn Square, at Broad and Market Streets. It will be an enormous structure, 486\u00a3 ft. long by 470 wide, four stories high, and covering an area of near- ly 4\u00a3 acres, not includ- ing a court- yard in the centre 200 ft. square. The central tow- er will be 450 ft. high. The exterior walls are to he of white marble, and those facing the court yard of light blue marble. Public Buildings, cor. Broad and Market Sts. The Custom-House, formerly the United States Bank, on Chestnut St. between 4th and 5Ui, is a chaste specimen of the Doric order of architecture, modeled on the Parthenon at Athens, with the omission of the colonnades at the sides. The Chest nut St. and Library St. fronts have each eight massive fluted columns, supporting a heavy entablature. The United States Mint, Chestnut St. cor. Juniper is a white marble building in the Ionic style, with a graceful portico. The processes of coining are very interesting, and the collection of coins preserved here is the largest and most valuable in the Union. Visitors are admitted to the Mint during eaclfsecular day from 9 to 12 o'clock, and the processes pointed out by an attendant. The United States Naval Asylum, on Gray's Ferry Road near South St., is an immense marble building standing in the midst of spacious and highly-cultivated grounds The Ionic portico, with 8 graceful columns, the trophy cannon, and the official resi dences, are worthy of notice. There are two U. S. Arsenals, one a short distance S. E. of the Naval Asylum, and the other near Frankford (reached by the red cars of the 2d and 3d St. line). The former is devoted to the manufacture of shoes equipments, and clothing for the army ; the latter is devoted to the manufacture of fixed ammunition, and contains one of the largest powder-magazines in the United"], [45, "PHILADELPHIA. 27 States. The Eastern Penitentiary, in Fairmount Ave. above 22d St., covers about 10 acres of ground, and in architecture resembles a baronial castle of the middle ages.

Churches. \u2014 Among the 424 churches in the city, the following are the most note worthy: the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul (Roman Catholic), on Logan Square, 18th St., is built of red sandstone, and is the largest church edifice in the city. It has a front of 136 ft., a depth of 216 ft., and is crowned by a dome 210 ft. high. The facade consists of a classic pediment upheld by four lofty Corinthian columns, flanked by pilastered wings. The interior is cruciform and adorned with frescoes; the altar-piece, by Brumidi, is conspicuous for its fine coloring. St. Peter's (Episcopal), cor. Pine and 3d Streets, is one of the old churches of the city ; it was begun in 1758, and finished in 1761. In the yard is a monument to Commo dore Decatur, and in the steeple a chime of bells.

On Broad St., near Green, is the Synagogue, a handsome thongh peculiar structure of the Saracenic order. Among the meeting houses of the Friends, that on the corner of Arch and 4th Sts. is best worth a visit. Educational and Charitable Institutions.\u2014 The University of Pennsylvania occupies a group of new and handsome buildings near 36th and Locust Streets, in West Phila delphia. It is one of the oldest institutions of the kind in the country, having been founded as an academy in 1749, erected into a college in 1755, and into a university in 1 779. It has academical, collegiate, art, scientific, medical, and law departments ; and in 1874-'75 had 56 instructors and 800 students. Its library numbers 18,000 volumes ; in the department of science there are a collection of American fossils and a mineralogical cabinet containing 10,000 specimens; and the medical depart ment has a valuable museum and cabinets. Girard College is situated on Ridge Ave., about 2 m. in a N. W. direction from the State-House. It was founded by Stephen Girard, a native of France, who died in 1831. He bequeathed $2,000,000 for the purpose of erecting suitable buildings \"for the gratuitous instruction and support of destitute orphans ; \" and the institution is supported by the income of the residue of his estate after the payment of certain legacies. On Dec. 31, 1874, the estate amounted to $6,104,862.22. The site of the college-grounds, embracing 42 acres, is on the summit of a slope commanding a fine view. The central or college building is 218 ft, long, 160 wide, and 97 high, and is a noble marble structure of the Corin- thian order. Theroofcom mands a wide view of the city. In the room in the building known as \"Girard's room\" are preserved the books and personal ef fects of the founder. A statue of Gi rard stands at the foot of the grand stair way, and un derneath the statue he is buried. The Girard Collefc' grounds contain a monument to the graduates of the college who fell in the civil war. Permits to visit the college may be obtained at the principal hotels, of the Secretary, or of the Directors. Clergymen are not admitted. Other leading edu cational institutions are the Wagner Free Institute of Science, cor. 17th St. and Montgomery Ave. ; the Jefferson Medical College, 10th St., near Chestnut; the Col lege of Physicians, cor. Locust and 13th Streets; the Hahnemann Medical College, Filbert St., near 11th; and the Polytechnic College, West Penn Square, near Mar ket St. Of the charitable institutions, those best worth a visit are the Blockley Alms louse (take Walnut St. cars to 34th St. ; tickets of admission at 42 N. 7th St.), an immense structure, consisting of four main buildings, each 500 ft. front, covering and inclosing about 10 acres of ground ; the Blind Asylum, cor. 20th and Race Sts., which is not an asylum but a school, in which the unfortunate persons for"], [49, "PHILADELPHIA. 31 whose benefit it was founded are instructed in useful trades, in music, and in the usual branches taught in schools; the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, cor. Broad and Pine (tickets at Ledger office); the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, Haverford Road, W. Philadelphia (take Market St. cars ; tickets at Ledger office) ; the Pennsylvania Hospital, cor. 8th and Spruce Sts., an admirable institution, founded in 1751 ; the Episcopal Hospital (2649 N.

Parks and Public Squares. \u2014 The great park of Philadelphia, and one of the largest in the world, is Fairmonnt Park, embracing 2,740 acres. It extends along both banks of the Schuylkill River for more than 7 m., and along both banks of Wissahickon Creek for more than 6 m., commencing at Fairmount, an elevation on the Schuyl kill from which the park derives its name, and extending to Chestnut Hill on the Wissahickon, a total distance of nearly 14 m. It possesses much natural beauty, being well wooded and having a great variety of surface ; but its beauty is that of the rural resort rather than of the city park, art, other than that of landscape-gar dening, having as yet done little for it. The main entrance to the park is at its lower end, and is reached by horse-cars from all parts of the city. Just inside, on the r. is Fairmount Hill, on the summit of which are the 4 reservoirs of the Schuyl kill Water-Works which supply the greater portion of the city with water. The reservoirs cover an area of over six acres, have a capacity of nearly 27,000,000 galls., and are surrounded by a beautiful graveled walk, from which may be had a fine view of the city. The power necessary for forcing the water into the reservoirs is obtained by a dam (1,600 ft. long) across the Schuylkill ; and by means of wheels moved by the water, which work forcing-pumps, the water of the river is raised to the top of the \" mount.\" The group of buildings containing the machinery lie just in front of the visitor as he enters the park. The grounds around them contain several fountains and pieces of statuary ; and N. of the reservoirs is a small fire proof art gallery, containing among other noteworthy pictures Rothermel's \"Battle of Gettysburg,\" West's \"Christ Rejected by the Jewish People,\" and Pauwel's great allegorical painting of the \" New Republic.\" Beyond this point is an open plaza, surrounded by flower-beds and shrubbery, and containing Randolph Rogers's colossal bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln ; and beyond this still is Lemon Hill, on the summit of which is the mansion (now used as a restaurant) in which Robert Morris lived during the Revolutionary War. The principal points of interest in the park, besides those we have mentioned, are Sedgeley Hill, a little above Lemon Hill on the carriage-road ; the Solitude, a villa built in 1785 by John Penn, grand son of William Penn ; the Zoological Gardens, containing a tine assortment ot American and European animals (admission 25c. for adults and 10c. for children) ; George's Hill, and the Belmont Mansion (now a restaurant), from both of which there are noble views; Belmont Glen, a picturesque ravine; the various bridges across the Schuylkill River ; and the romantic drive up the Wissahickon. (See also \" Centennial Exposition,\" page 32.) Park-carriages, starting from the Fairmount entrance, traverse the most interesting portions of the park (50c for the round trip). Carriages may also be hired for $1.50 per hour. Logan Square, 18th St. between Race and Vine, contains 7 acres, neatly laid out and beautifully shaded ; the Sanitary Fair was held here in June, 1864, and the great Roman Catholic Cathedral fronts the square. Independence Square, in the rear of Independence Hall, is inclosed by a solid brick wall, and contains some majestic trees. It was within this inclosure that the Declaration of Independence was first publicly read, July 4, 1776. Washington Square, diagonally opposite In dependence Square, is surrounded by a handsome iron railing with 4 principal en trances, and is admirably kept. It is celebrated for containing every (or nearly every) tree that will grow in this climate, whether indigenous or not. There is a map of the square showing the position of each tree. Franklin Square, at 6th and Race Streets, is an attractive promenade, with a fountain in its centre, surrounded"], [50, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 32 by a marble basin, and adorned with a great variety of trees. Rittenhouse Square, at 18th and Walnut Streets, is in the aristocratic quarter of the city, and is bordered bv elegant private residences. Miscellaneous Places of Interest.\u2014 Philadelphia boasts of more beautiful cemeteries than any other city in the country. The principal one is Laurel Hill, established in 1835, occupying a slope on the E. bank of the Schuylkill, adjoining ihe upper part of Fairmount Park ; it embraces nearly 200 acres and is divided into North, South, and Central Laurel Hill. It contains many fine monuments; but the dis tinguishing feature of the cemetery is its unique garden landscape, and the profusion of beautiful trees, shrubs, and flowers, which adorn it. Among the former are some cedars of Lebanon, the first which bore fruit in the United States. Admission every day, except Sunday, from 9 o'clock till sunset. Glenwood (21 acres) is prettily situated on the ridge which divides the waters flowing into the Delaware from those flowing into the Schuylkill (reached by Ridge Ave. cars). Monument Cemetery (Broad St. opposite Berks), Mount Vernon (nearly opposite Laurel Hill), and Wood lands (Darby Road, West Philadelphia, reached by Darby cars), are all worth a visit. The latter contains the Drexel mausoleum, the finest in America. The United States Navy- Yard is located on the Delaware at the foot of Federal St., and incloses about 12 acres. It contains extensive workshops, docks, and arsenals, barracks and artillery-parks, and a sectional floating-dock, built in 1850, at a cost of $1,000,000. At one of the docks is the frigate Constitution (\" OldTron sides \"), the most renowned vessel of the American Navy. This yard will be sold as soon as League Island (lying in the Delaware at the foot of Broad St.) is ready for occupancy. League Island, a low tract of land (600 acres) at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill, was presented by the city to the U. S. Government on condition of its being converted into a great naval depot. Comparatively little work has yet been done on it, but a fleet of monitors and iron-clads is usually anchored in the \" Back Channel,\" which separates the island from the mainland. Centennial Exposition of 1876. \u2014 The Exhibition Buildings are located in Fairmount Park at the head of Girard Ave., which leads directly from the heart of the city to the main entrance. The grounds set apart for them embrace 236 acres, stretching S. E. from the foot of George's Hill to the Schuylkill River, and are beautifully laid out. The arrangements for conveying visitors to and from the grounds are very complete. The Pennsylvania and Reading Railroads each have an immense depot directly adjoining the grounds ; and as the tracks of these roads connect with every other line entering Philadelphia, visitors arriving by rail, from whatever quarter, are landed at the gates without change of cars. All the leading lines of horse-cars have termini at the entrance and afford an easy means of access from all points within the city. Besides the regular carriages, the Exhibition Transfer Co. have light and elegant wagonettes, seating 10 passengers, which run between the depots and various points in the city and the Exhibition grounds (fare 50 c). In addition to these a line of steamboats runs from the water-works at Fairmount to Belmont landing, affording a pleasant route to the Exhibition. Within the grounds, a nar row-gauge dummy-railroad makes the circuit of the buildings, and carries visitors from one to the other (fare 5 c). The first of the buildings reached in coming from the city is the Main Exhibition Building; but the only point from which to obtain a comprehensive view of them all is from the summit of George's Hill, on the W. margin of the grounds, the point of view taken in the accompanying picture. The Main Building and Machinery Hall are in a line forming the southern boundary; the others are dotted somewhat irregularly over the grounds, and present a very agreeable diversity of lines and angles. The central point is near the S. E. end of the U. S. Government Building, and here the principal walks intersect. The Main Building (in which are displayed the departments of Mining and Metallurgy, Manufactures, and Education and Science) is an immense parallelogram 1,876 ft. long and 464 ft. wide, covering an area of nearly 21\u00a3 acres. The larger portion is one story high, the interior height being 70 ft., and the cornice on the outside 48 ft. from the ground. Towers, 75 ft. high, rise at each corner of the"], [51, "PHILADELPHIA. 33 building ; and in the centre the roof for a space 184 ft. square is raised above the surrounding portion, and 4 towers 48 ft. square, rising to a height of 120 ft., are introduced into the corners of this elevated roof. At the centre of the longer sides are projections 416 ft. in length, and at the ends projections 216 ft. in length. In these are located the main entrances, which are provided with arcades upon the Main Exhibition Building. ground floor, and central facades 90 ft. high. The E. entrance is the principal approach for carriages, visitors alighting under cover of the arcade. The S. entrance is the principal approach from railway-cars. The W. entrance opens upon the main passage-way to Machinery and Agricultural Halls; and the N. entrance to Memorial Hall (Art Gallery). There are numerous side entrances, each surmounted with a trophy showing the national colors of the country occupying that portion of the building. The ground plan of the building shows a central avenue, 1,832 ft. long and 120 ft. wide. On either side of this is another avenue of equal length and 100 ft. wide. Between the central and side avenues are aisles 48 ft. wide, and on the outer sides of the building smaller aisles of 24 ft. width. Three transepts 416 ft. long cross the building, and at their intersection with the longitudinal avenues make 9 spaces, free from supports, which are from 100 to 120 ft. square. The materials used in the construction of the building are iron (of which nearly 8,000,000 lbs. were required), glass, aud wood ; and the interior walls and roof are tastefully decorated. Machinery Hall is located about 550 ft. W. of the Main Building, and as its north front is upon the same line it is practically a continuation of that edifice. The building consists of a main hall 1,402 ft. long and 360 ft. wide, with an annex on the S. side 208 by 210 ft. The entire area covered is about 14 acres. The greater portion of the building is one story high, the main cornice on the outside being 40 ft. from the ground, and the interior height to the top of the ventilators in the avenues 70 ft. and in the aisles 40 ft. There are projections on each of the 4 sides, and the main entrances are finished with facades 78 ft. high. The E. entrance is the main approach from the railways and from the Main Building. Along the S. side are the boiler-houses and other buildings for special kinds of machinery. The ground-plan of the Hall shows 2 main avenues 90 ft. wide with a central aisle between and an aisle on either side, these being 60 ft. wide. Each of these avenues and aisles is 1,360 ft. long. At the centre of the building is a transept 90 ft. wide, which at the S. end is prolonged 208 ft. beyond the building, forming an annex con taining hydraulic machinery. In the centre of it is a tank 160 by 60 ft., with 10 ft. depth of water, and at the S. end of the tank is a waterfall 35 ft. high and 40 ft. wide supplied by the pumps on exhibition. Where the transept crosses the cen tral avenue is the great Corliss engine (1,400 horse-power) which drives the main shafting. The Memorial Hall (Art Gallery) was erected by the State and city at a cost of $1,500,000, and is the most imposing and ornate of all the Exhibition buildings. It stands on an elevated terrace a short distance N. of the main building, and, as it is to be permanent, is constructed throughout of stone, brick, and iron. It is in the modern Renaissance style, 365 ft. long and 210 ft. wide, and surmounted by a dome"], [52, "34 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. (of glass and iron) 150 ft. high, at the top of which is a colossal ball from which rises the figure of Columbia. At each corner of the base of the dome is a colossal figure representing the 4 quarters of the globe ; while over the corners of the 4 cor ner-pavilions are colossal cast-iron eagles with wings outstretched. The frieze around the entire building is richly ornamented. The main entrance is on the S. front and consists of three enormous arched doorways, each 40 ft. high and 18 ft. wide, opening into a hall. Between the arches of the doorways are clusters of col umns termina- ting in em blematic de signs illustra tive of Science and Art. The doors are of iron, relieved >y bronze pan - Is, displaying die coats of ums of all the States and Territories. On each front of the building Memorial Hall (Art Building!. the entrances open into halls 82 ft. long, 60 ft. wide, and 53 ft. high. These, in turn, open into the centre hall, which is 83 ft. square and 80 ft. high. From the E. and W. sides of this centre hall extend the galleries, each 98 ft. long, 48 ft. wide, and 35 ft. high. From the galleries doors open into two smaller galleries, 89 ft. long and 28 ft. wide. These open N. and S. into private apartments connecting with the pavilion-rooms, and forming two side galleries 210 ft. long. There are also a number of smaller rooms, designed for studios, etc. In each pavilion is a window 12\u00a3 ft. by 34 ft. in which is a display of stained glass and glass paintings. This fine building gives 75.000 sq. ft. of wall-space for pictures, and 20,000 sq. ft. of floor-space for statues, etc. ; but even this proved insufficient, and a large brick building is connected with it on the rear. The Horticultural Building, also permanent, stands a short distance N. of Me morial Hall, and is 383 ft. long, 193 ft. wide, and 72 ft. high to the top of the lantern. It is in the Moresque style of architecture, the chief material being iron and glass, supported by fine marble and brickwork. The decorations (polychrome frescoes and arabesques in the Moorish style) are charming; and in its grace of contour and warmth of color it affords a pleasing contrast to the severe lines and sober hue of the Art Hall. The main floor is occupied by the central conservatory, which is flanked on the N. and S. sides by 4 forcing-houses for the propagation of young plants, cov ered by curved roofs of iron and glass, which are a tine feature of the exterior of the building. The E. and W. entrances are approached by flights of blue marble steps, from terraces, in the centre of each of which is a small, open kiosque. Sur rounding the building are 35 acres of ground devoted to horticultural purposes. Agricultural Hall stands N. of the Horticultural Building, from which it is sep arated by a romantic ravine crossed by a bridge. It consists of a nave 820 ft. long, crossed at right angles by three transepts, each 540 ft. long. The framework of nave and transepts is a succession of slight and extremely pointed Gothic arches of wood. The interior resembles that of an immense Gothic cathedral, and in looking from transept to transept the view is very imposing. Of the miscellaneous buildings the most noticeable is the Women's Pavilion,"], [53, "BALTIMORE. 35 which faces Belmont Ave. N. of Machinery Hall. It is of wood, and consists of two naves (each 192 ft. long and 64 ft. w:ide) intersecting each other at right angles. In it is exhibited \" everything women make that is worth showing.\" W. of this is the U. S. Government Building, a cruciform wooden structure with a glass dome. The portions occupied by the different departments are indicated by the decorations on the adjacent walls. Near the main entrance on Elm Ave. is the Jury Pavilion, an ornate two-story structure, which contains, besides numerous small chambers for the use of the International Juries, a spacious hall suitable for receptions, banquets, etc. In addition to all these, numerous special buildings have been erected by the various States, by foreign nations, and by private enterprise. There are 6 large restaurants within the inclosure, besides from 2 to 4 buffets in each of the Exhibi tion buildings. The grounds are adorned with a number of fountains and statues, and contain 7 m. of roads and foot-paths, and quite a number of bridges, summer houses, etc. PHILADELFl^P TO BALTIMORE ( Via Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore R. R. Distance, i)8 m. Time, 3% lo 5 hrs. Fare, $3.25.) The country traversed on this route has few scenic attractions, though the numei ous highly-cultivated farmsteads and clustering towns indicate a populous and long settled region. Chester (14 m.) is the oldest town in Pennsylvania, having been set tled by the Swedes in 1643 ; and 4 m. beyond it is the Brandywine, famous for the battle fought on its banks in September, 1777. Wilmington (28 m.) is the chief city of the State of Delaware. It has 30,841 inhabitants, and its manufacturing interests are very extensive and various, embracing ship-building, car-manufactories, cotton and woolen factories, flour-mills, powder-mills, and shoe and leather factories. There is a restaurant in the depot, and the ti'ains usually stop from 5 to 10 minutes. Netvark (40 m.) is the seat of Delaware College ; and 4 m. beyond it the train crosses the celebrated Mason and Dixon's line, long the boundary between the Northern and Southern States. At Havre de Grace (62 m.) the Susquehanna River is crossed on a lofty wooden bridge nearly a mile long. In entering Baltimore a view of the Patapsco River and Fort McHenryiinay be obtained from the car-window on the 1. BALTIMORE. BALTIMORE, the chief city of Maryland, and in population and commerce cne of the most important in the United States, is picturesquely situated on the N. branch of the Patapsco River, 14 m. from its entrance into Chesapeake Bay, and about 200 m. from the Atlantic. It embraces an area of about 12 sq. m., nearly half of which is thickly built upon. Jones's Falls, a small stream running N. and S., spanned by numerous bridges, divides the city into two nearly equal parts known as East and West Baltimore. The harbor is capacious and safe, consisting of an inner basin into which vessels of considerable burden can enter, and an outer harbor acces sible to the largest ships. The entrance is defended by Fort McHenry, which was unsuccessfully bombarded by the British fleet in the War of 1812. The present site of Baltimore was chosen in 1729, and its name was given it (in 1745) in honor of Lord Baltimore, the proprietary of Maryland. In 1780 it became a port of entry. In 1782 the first pavements were laid in Baltimore St., and in the same year the first regular communication with Philadelphia was established through a line of stage-coaches. The charter of the city dates from 1797. The population, which at that time was 26,000, had increased by 1850 to nearly 200,000 ; in 1860 it was 212,418, and in 1870, 267,354. The commerce of the city is very active. Two lines of European steamers now start from her harbor; and through her two great arteries of traffic (the Baltimore & Ohio and the Northern Central Railroads) she is successfully competing for the trade of the North and Northwest. Large shipments of grain are made to Europe, and tobacco, cotton, petroleum, bacon, butter, cheese, and lard, are also exported.

It is pleasantly situated in the northern suburbs of the city ; contains 680 acres ; was opened in 1861 ; and has cost about $1,500,000. The archi tectural decorations of the park are few ; its charms lying chiefly in its rural beauty, its secluded walks, drives, and bridle-paths. The surface is undulating and well wooded, the trees being among the oldest and finest in any public park in America. Many of the eminences overlook the surrounding country, and from the tower at the head of Druid Hill Lake there is f> superb view of the city and harbor."], [58, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 40 Patterson Park, at the E. end of Baltimore St., embraces 70 acres, pleasantly laid out, and commands extensive views in every direction. In the park may be seen remains of earthworks thrown up for the defense of the city in the War of 1812. Federal Hill stands on the S. side of the inner basin, is crowned by a signal-station, and commands fine views of the shipping, city, river, and bay.

The first view of the Capitol in approaching the city is very fine, and should not be lost. 'WASHINGTON CITY.i \"YTTASHINGTON CITY, the politic 1 capital of the United States, is situated on W the N. bank of the Potomac River, at its confluence with the Eastern Branch. Its site is an admirable one, consisting of an extensive undulating plain surrounded by rolling hills and diversified by irregular elevations which furnish ad vantageous positions for the various public buildings. The plan of the city is unique (\"the city of Philndelphia griddled across the city of Versailles\"), and is on a scale which shows that it was expected that a vast metropolis would grow up there. It covers an area 44; m. long by 2| broad, embracing nearly 11 sq. m. ; a very small portion of this, however, is as yet built upon. The site, if not chosen by Washing ton himself, seems to have been selected through his agency, and it was he who laid the corner-stone of the Capitol. This was on Sept. 18, 1793, seven years before the seat of government was removed thither from Philadelphia. Under Washington's direction the city was planned and laid out by Andrew Ellicott. It appears to have been Washington's desire that it should be called the \"Federal City,\" but the name of \"the city of Washington\" was conferred upon it on Sept. 9, 1791. Its ancient name was Conococheague, derived from a rapid stream of that name which ran near the city, and which, in the Indian tongue, means the Roaring Brook. The city was incorporated May 3, 1802. Its population in 1860 was 60,000, and in 1870, 109,199. This is increased during the sessions of Congress by a floating population amounting to many thousands. The commerce and manufactures of Washington are unimpor tant. The best time to visit Washington, if one wishes to see its most characteristic aspect, is during the sessions of Congress. These begin on the first Monday in De cember, and last until March 4, in the odd-numbered years, and until June or July in the even-numbered years. During this period the galleries of the Senate and House of Representatives are open to visitors. The sessions of both Houses begin at noon and usually close before sunset, but sometimes they are prolonged far into the night. A flag displayed over the N. wing of the Capitol indicates that the Sen ate is in session ; over the S. wing that the House is in session. When the sittings are prolonged into the night, the great lantern over the dome is illuminated, afford ing a brilliant light which is visible for many miles. The best time for seeing the natural beauties of Washington is May, or early June, and October."], [59, "WASHINGTON. 41 Hotels and Restaurants. \u2014 The Arlington, in Vermont, Ave. between H and I Sts., is a new and handsome hotel in the fashionable quarter ($5 a day).

On the steps of the central portico are groups of statuary by Persico and Greenough ; and on the grounds in front of it is Green ough's colossal statue of Washington. Colossal marble statues of Peace and War The Capitol. are on the r. and 1. of the entrance ; and over the doorway is a bass-relief of Fame and Peace crowning Washington with laurel. The W. front projects 83 ft., and is embellished with a recessed portico of 10 columns. This front, though not so imposing architecturally as the eastern, commands a fine view of the central and western portions of the city and of all the principal public buildings. The Bronze Door, which forms the entrance to the Rotunda from the E. portico, is worth atten tion. It was designed by Randolph Rogers, cast by Von Miiller at Munich, is 17 feet high and 9 ft. wide, weighs 20,000 lbs., and cost $30,000. The work is in alto rilievo. and commemorates the history of Columbus and the discovery of America. Each of the 8 panels contains a scene in the life of the great discoverer ; and the statuettes, 16 in number, between the panels and on the sides of the door, represent the eminent contemporaries of Columbus. There are also bronze doors at the entrance to the Senate wing, designed by Crawford, who died before they were completed. They were finished by Rinehart. of Baltimore. The Rotunda is 96 ft. in diameter and 180 ft. high. It contains 8 large pictures, illustrating scenes in American history, painted for the Government by native artists. Four of them are by Trumbnll, namely, \"The Declaration of Independence.\" \"The Surrender of General Burgoyne,\" \" The Surrender of Lord Cornwallis,\" and \" General Washing ton resigning his Commission.\" The others are \"The Landing of Columbus,\" by J. Vanderlyn ; \"The Discovery of the Mississippi by De Soto,\" by W. H. Powell; \"The Baptism of Pocahontas,\" by John G. Chapman; and \"The Embarkation of the Pilgrims,\" by R. W. Weir.

The floor is of freestone, supported by arches of brick, resting upon two concentric peristyles of Doric columns in the crypt below. The Dome rises over the Rotunda in the centre of the Capitol, and is the most imposing feature of the vast pile. The"], [61, "WASHINGTON. 43 interior measures 96 ft. in diameter, and 220 ft. from the floor to the ceiling. Ex ternally it is 135J ft. in diameter, and rises 241 ft. above the roof of the main build ing, 307$ ft. above the base-line of the building, and 377 ft. above low tide. Visitors should not fail to make the ascent of the Dome. A spiral stairway between the outer and inner shells (diverging to the 1. from the corridor outside the N. door of the Rotunda) affords easy access, and gives a favorable opportunity for inspecting from different points of view the fresco-painting on the canopy overhead. This is the work of Brumidi ; it covers 6,000 ft. of space and cost $40,000. It consists of a portrait of Washington in a sitting posture. To his r. is seated the Goddess of Liberty, and on the 1. a female figure representing Victory and Fame proclaiming Freedom. In a semicircle is a group of females representing the original sister colonies, bearing aloft a banner on which is inscribed the national motto (\" E Plu ribus Unum\"). Surrounding this under-circle, near the base of the design, are 6 groups representing War, Agriculture, Mechanics, Commerce, the Navy, and Sci ence. In the latter group the figures of Franklin, Fulton, and Walter, occupy prom inent places. All the figures (63 in number) are of colossal proportions, so as to appear life-size when seen from the floor beneath. From the balustrade at the base of the canopy is obtained a magnificent view of the city and the surrounding coun try. From the gallery immediately underneath the fresco gallery another spiral stairway leads up to the lantern (17 ft, in diameter and 52 ft. high). This is sur mounted by the tholus, or ball, and this in turn by Crawford's fine bronze statue of Liberty, 16i ft, high. \u2014 Leaving the Rotunda by the S. doorway, the visitor finds himself in the Old Hall of Representatives (now used as a \"National Statuary Hall ''). This room, the noblest in the Capitol, is semicircular in form, 96 ft. long and 57 ft. high to the apex of the ceiling. The 24 columns which support the entablature are of variegated green breccia, or pudding-stone, from the Potomac Val ley; and the ceiling is painted in panel, in imitation of that of the Pantheon at Rome. Light is admitted through a cupola in the centre of the ceiling. Over the S. door is a statue of Liberty, by Causici, and an eagle by Valaperti. Over the N. door is a statue by Franzoni representing History standing in a winged car, the wheel of which, by an ingenious device, forms the dial of a clock. In 1864 the Hall was set apart to receive statues of eminent Americans ; each State being requested to send statues of two of its most eminent men. New York has sent George Clinton (bronze), and Robert W. Livingston (marble) ; Rhode Island, Roger Williams and General Greene (both marble) ; and Connecticut, Jonathan Trumbull and Roger Sherman (both marble). Massachusetts is to send Winthrop and Samuel Adams; Maryland, Charles Carroll and Roger B. Taney ; and New Jersey, General Philip Kearney and Richard Stockton. Houdon's Washington and Stone's Hamilton, some busts and portraits of minor importance, and Moran's great painting of the \" Grand Canon of the Yellowstone,\" further adorn the Hall. \u2014 The corridor to the S. leads to the present Hall of Representatives, the finest legislative chamber in the world, 139 ft. long, 93 ft. wide, and 36 ft. high. The ceiling \"is of iron-work, with 45 stained glass panels on which are painted the arms of the States. To the 1. of the marble desk of the Speaker is a full-length portrait of Lafayette, and to the r. a full-length portrait of Washington by Vanderlyn. The Strangers' Gallery (reached by two grand marble stairways) extends entirely round the hall ; the space not specially appropriated for the use of the diplomatic corps and the reporters for the press is open to visitors. The Speaker's Room, immediately in rear of his desk, is a richly-decorated apartment. From the S. lobby of the Hall two stairways descend to the basement, where are located the Refectory and committee-rooms. The room of the Committee on Agriculture will repay a visit ; the walls and ceiling are painted in fresco by Brumidi. \u2014 The Senate Chamber, reached by the corridor leading N. from the Rotunda, is somewhat smaller than the Hall of Representa tives, being 1134; ft. long, 801 ft. -wide, and 36 ft. high. It is very tastefully fitted up. The visitors' galleries are reached by marble stairways, which are among the most striking architectural features of the Capitol. The President's and Vice- President's Rooms, the Senators' Retiring-Room, the Reception-Room, and the Senate Post-Office, are beautiful chambers. The Marble Room is particularly chaste"], [62, "44 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. and rich in its decorations; senators alone have the privilege of allowing visitors to enter it. The Vice-President's Room contains Rembrandt Peale's portrait of Washington. In the basement of the Senate Extension are committee-rooms, richly frescoe d and furnished, and the corridors are exquisitely painted. \u2014 The Supreme- Court Room (formerly the Senate-Chamber) is reached by the corridor leading N. from the Rotunda. It is a semicircular apartment, 75 ft. long and 45 ft. high, deco rated with rich Ionie columns of Potomac marble, and with busts of the former Chief-Justices. Visitors are admitted during the sessions of the Court (October to May, 12 to 4 p. m.). Underneath the room is the apartment formerly occupied by the Court and now devoted to the Law Library (30,000 volumes). \u2014 The Library of Congress is reached by the corridor from the W. door of the Rotunda. It occupies the entire W. projection of the Capitol ; the main room is 91 ft. long and 34 ft. wide, ceiled with iron, and fitted up with fire-proof cases. The Library was founded in 1800 ; was burned by the British in 1814 ; was again partially burned in 1851 ; and went into its present rooms in 1853. The collection, which is the largest in the United States, now numbers nearly 300,000 volumes, exclusive of pamphlets, and is increasing at the rate of 10,000 or 15,000 volumes a year. All copyright books are, by law, required to be deposited in this library, and the representation of American publications is by far the most complete in the country. It is also rich in foreign books in every department of literature. Books may be read in the library by visitors, but not taken away (open from 10 a. m. to 4 p. m.). \u2014 The light ing, heating, and ventilating apparatus of the House and Senate Chambers are worthy of notice. The Executive Mansion (usually called the \" White House \") is in Pennsylvania Ave., I-\"*? m. W. of the Capitol. It is of freestone, painted white, 170 ft. long and 86 ft. deep, two stories high, and was modeled after the palace of the Duke of Leinster. It was built in 1 792, but was so much injured during the occupation of the city by the Brit ish in 1814 that extensive repairs were found necessary; these were made in 1815. The N. front has a deep portico ornamented with 10 Ionic columns ; \"White House.\" under this, carriages drive to deposit visitors. The Potomac front has a circular colonnade of 6 Ionic columns. The \"East Room\" (open daily from 9 a. m. to 3 p. m.) is the grand parlor of the Presi dent. It is a fine chamber, 80 ft. long, 40 ft. wide, and 20 ft. high, richly decorated and furnished. The Blue, Red, and Green Rooms are on the same floor, and are elegant in their appointments. The Executive Office and the Cabinet Room are on the 2d floor, as are also the private apartments of the family. 8. of the Mansion is a pleasant park, tastefully laid out; in the centre of the lawn is a bronze statue of Jefferson ; on the W. are extensive conservatories. The U.S. Treasury is just E. of the White House, at the cor. of Pennsylvania Ave. and loth St. (open to visitors from 9 a. m. to 2 p. m.). It is the finest building for the purpose in the world. The E. front has an unbroken Ionic colonnade, 342 ft. long, modeled after that of the temple of Minerva at Athens. It was the first part built, and was commenced in 1836. The extension was begun in 1855, from designs by Walter, the architect of the Capitol extension. The extension flanks the old\" build ing at each end with massive fronts, and the entire edifice is 582 ft. long by 300 ft. wide, and cost $6,000,000. The material of the old building is brown sandstone, painted ; that of the extension is solid Dix Island granite. The W. front has side porticoes, and a grand central entrance with 8 monolithic columns of enormous size. The N\". and S. fronts are alike, and are adorned with stately porticoes. The building contains about 200 rooms, of which the finest is the Cash Room, extending through The stories and lined throughout with rich marbles in decorative combinations. two Gold Room, in which there is usually about $10,000,000 in gold coin, may be"], [63, "WASHINGTON. 45 seen by permit from the Treasurer. The corridors are ornamented with colored marbles, and the stairways are imposing. Treasury Department. The War and Navy Departments are plain brick buildings in 17th St., W. of the White House, with nothing but their size to invite attention. A collection of flags and other trophies, captured during the Civil War, will be found in both these De partments ; the visitor's card, accompanied by a request, will insure the opportunity of seeing them. An immense building for the uses of the State, War, and Navy Depart- State, War, and Navy Building- ments is now nearly finished. It fronts Executive Ave. between 17th and 18th Sts. (adjoining the buildings just mentioned), and is 567 ft. long and 342 ft. wide, four stories high, with lofty Mansard roof. The material is granite, and the building will be absolutely fire-proof. The State Department has already moved in, and occupies the 2d floor. The Department Library contains a fine collection of books, maps, and charts."], [64, "46 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. The Patent-Office, in which is located the office of the Interior Department, is one of the finest of the Government buildings. It occupies the entire block between 7th and 9th and F and H Sts., and is 410 ft. long and 275 ft. deep. It is of marble and whitened sandstone, in severe and massive Doric style, and has a portico on each of its four fronts. The F St. portico (main entrance) is reached by broad granite steps, and consists of 16 Doric columns of immense size, upholding a classic pediment. The interior of the building is admirably designed and handsomely finished. The Model-Room (open from 9 a. m. to 3 p. m.) occupies the entire upper floor of the edifice, forming 4 large halls or chambers unequaled for extent and beauty on the continent. The total length of this floor is 1,350 ft., or rather more than a quarter of a mile; and it is filled with cases containing immense numbers of models representing every department of mechanical art. The entire collection numbers over 120,000 articles. The frescoes on the ceiling of the S. Hall are much admired. In this room are cases containing a collection of Revolutionary curiosities and relics, among which are the printing-press of Benjamin Franklin, and many of the personal effects of Washington, including the uniform worn by him when he re signed his commission as Commander-in-Chief. Near these are cases for the preser vation of medals and treaties with foreign powers. Among the latter are treaties with Louis Philippe (1831), Louis XVI. (1778), and Louis XVIII. (1822). A fine collection of sabres, presented by the Bey of Egypt to Captain Perrie, U. S. N., in 1832, adorns the upper end of this case. \u2014 On the second or main floor are the offices of the Secretary of the Interior, the Indian Office, the General Land-Office, the Pension and Census Bureaus, and the office of the Commissioner of Patents. The General Post-Office, opposite the S. front of the Patent-Office, is an imposing edifice of white marble in the Italian or modified Corinthian style. It is 300 ft. long, 204 ft. dee]>, and three stories high, and cost $1,700,000. It was commenced in 1839, extended in 1855, under the direction of Mr. Walter, and finished in 1865. Monoliths of Carrara marble form the columns of the extension. The City Post- Office occupies the lower story of the F St. front. The whole upper portion is ap propriated to the use of the General or United States Post-Office. The Dead-Letter Office (2d story) contains some curious objects. The Department of Agriculture (open from 9 a. m. to 3 p. M.) is situated on the Mall at the foot of 13th St. It is a handsome brick building in the Renaissance style, 170 ft. long and 3 stories high with Mansard roof, and contains a library, a Museum of Agriculture, an Herbarium (with 25,000 varieties of plants), and an Entomological Museum. The Flower-Gardens in front of the main building are adorned with statuary, and when in bloom are a truly glorious sight. N. of the main building is the Arboretum, and S. extensive Experimental Gardens. The Plant-Houses, W. and S. of the main building, will repay a visit. The Botanical Gardens occupy the square immediately W. of the Capitol (entrance on 1st St.). These gardens are under the control of the Library Committee of Con gress, and are free to visitors (open from 9 to 6). The vast conservatories belonging to them are filled with rare and curious plants, fruits, and flowers. The National Observatory is situated on high ground near the Potomac (at the foot of 24th St.), and commands a fine view of both Washington and Georgetown. The Observatory was founded in 1842, and is now one of the foremost institutions of the kind in the world. It possesses many fine instruments, including the largest equatorial telescope yet made, and a good library of astronomical works. Strangers are allowed to visit the Observatory at all hours, and to inspect the telescope and other instruments when they are not in use. The Signal- Office, the headquarters of the Weather Bureau, is on G St., near the War Department. The instruments used here are of the most delicate description. The Hydrographic Office isin an old building called the Octagon, at the cor. of New York Ave. and 18th St. It pre pares charts and sailing-directions. The U. S. Arsenal is located in the midst of pleasant grounds on Greenleaf's Point, at the confluence of the Potomac and the Eastern Branch. The present buildings were erected in 1814 by Colonel Bomford, and contain vast stores of arms and ammunition. Near the centre of the grounds is an immense park of artillery,"], [65, "WASHINGTON. 47 containing nearly 1,000 cannon of all sizes and descriptions. In front of the old bar- racks is a trophy-battery, containing British, French, Mexican, and Confederate guns, captured in battle. The Ordnance Museum is on the 2d floor of Winder's Building, cor. F and 17th Sts. It contains captured battle-flags, cannon and small-arms, am- munition of all kinds, uniforms and military equipments, trophies, and models of field and fortress artillery in position, and of fortifications. The Navy-lard is situated on the Eastern Branch, about \\\\ m. S. E. of the Capitol. It has an area of 27 acres, inclosed by a substantial brick wall, and entered by a portal designed by Latrobe. Within the inclosure, besides homes for the officers, are shops and warehouses, 2 large ship-houses, and an armory \u2014 which, like the rest of the establishment, is kept in the finest order. Upon entering, the visitor is re- quired to register his name at the office, after which he can ramble through the buildings at his leisure, under the escort of a guide. He should not fail to inspect the ordnance-foundery and shops where the manufacture of guns, shot, and shells, is usually going on. Leaving the Foundery he should go to the Museum, where there is an interesting collection of fire-arms, warlike munitions, and relics. At other points in the yard are collections of guns and other trophies, captured during war or otherwise acquired. An interesting feature is the Experimental Battery, where experiments in the science of naval gunnery are carried on ; and still another promi- nent object is the fleet, including several Monitors, Torpedo-Boats, and Iron-clads. \u2014 Two squares N. of the Navy-Yard are the Marine Barracks, the headquarters of the U. S. Marine Corps; and in the immediate vicinity of the same is the Marine Hospital, for sick and disabled sailors. Washington Monument. \u2014 This monument, which was to have been the loftiest and finest in the world, is, in its present unfinished state, rather a blemish than an orna- ment to the city. The design contemplated a shaft 600 ft. high, with an ornamented base, modeled after the Pantheon at Rome, 250 ft. in diameter and 100 ft. high, to be surrounded by a colonnade of 30 Doric columns, with suitable entablature and balustrade. Within the base or \" Temple,\" statues of Revolutionary heroes and relics of Washington were to have been placed, and the whole interior elaborately adorned with finely-carved stones sent by the different States, by foreign govern- ments, and by societies. Many of these blocks are beautiful specimens, worthy of inspection ; they are contained in a shed near the structure. The monument is now 174 ft. high and has cost $230,000. It is doubtful whether it will ever be com- pleted, as $1,200,000 are necessary to do so. It is proposed to demolish it and con- struct a grand triumphal arch from the materials (located on the W. end of the Mall, above 14th St.). \u2014 Mill's colossal equestrian Statue of Washington stands within the circle formed by the junction of Pennsylvania and New Hampshire Aves. and 23d and K Sts. The head and face of Washington are from a bust by Houdon, taken in Washington's lifetime, and are considered very natural. \"The horse is represented as shrinking back before the destructive fire of the enemy [at the battle of Princeton], while the rider surveys the scene with the calmness and resolution which know no fear when honor and duty are at stake.\" II. K. Browne's colossal equestrian Statue of General Scott, cast from captured Mexican cannon and completed in 1874 at a cost of $20,000, stands in Massachusetts Ave. above 14th St. It is a noble work. The pedestal is made of 5 enormous granite blocks, 2 of which are said to be the largest quarried stones in the world, ex- cept those in the ancient walls of Jerusalem and Baalbek. Theatres and Places of Amusement. \u2014 The National Theatre, on E. St. near 14th, is the principal in the city, and has a good stock-company. Ford's Opera-House, 9th St. near Pennsylvania Ave., accommodates about 1,500 persons and produces comedy and melodrama. Lincoln Hall,- cor. 9th and D Sts., is the finest in the city, and the one generally used for concerts, lectures, readings, etc. In Masonic Hall (F and 9th Sts.) public parties and balls are frequently given. Odd-Fellows' Hall is in 7th St., between D and E; Willard's Hall in F St. near 14th; and Metzerott Hall in Pennsylvania Ave. between 9th and 10th Sts.

The Washington Library (in 11th St.) was incorporated in 1814, and numbers 15,000 volumes. The Patent-Office Library is rich in scientific and mechanical works. At the offices of the Washington correspondents of leading American newspapers (on Newspaper Row near the cor. of 14th and F Sts.) files of newspapers are usu ally accessible to the visitor. The Corcoran Gallery of Art, at the cor. of Pennsylvania Ave. and 17th St., is a \u25a0 in the decorated Renaissance style. ~ was founded by W. W.

(The easiest approach"], [67, "WASHINGTON. 49 from Pennsylvania Ave. is by 7th St.) This noble institution was founded by James Smithson, an Englishman, \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.\" The building was commenced in 1847 and completed soon after. It is 447 ft. long by 150 w7ide, and has 9 towers ranging from 75 to 150 ft. in height. It contains a museum of natural history with numerous and valuable specimens, arranged in a series of spacious halls ; and metallurgical, mineralogical, and ethno logical collections, with many curiosities. The grounds attached to the Insti tution were laid out by Downing, the eminent landscape-gardener, to whose mem ory a rich vase of Italian marble has been erected by the Pomological Society. Visitors are admitted to the Institution from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m. Columbian Univer sity, in 14th St. near the city limits, is a flourishing Baptist institution, with aca demical, law, and medical departments. The buildings are finely situated on the crest of a hill commanding extensive views. Howard University is on the 7th St. Road just beyond the city limits. It was founded in 1867 for the education of youth \" without regard to sex or color,\" but its students, 700 in number, are nearly all negroes. The University building is a large structure of brick, painted white, situated on elevated ground, and surmounted by a tower from which there is a fine view of the city and its environs. The Louise Home, near the cor. of 17th St. and Massachusetts Ave., is an ele gant building erected by Mr. W. W. Corcoran at a cost of $200,000 to afford a home to impoverished elderly ladies of education and good family. It is liberally endowed. The Soldiers' Home (for disabled soldiers of the regular army) occupies an elevated plateau 3 m. N. of the city (reached by 7th St. horse-cars). It consists of several marble buildings in the Norman style, of which the main one is 600 ft, long. A fine park of 500 acres surrounds the buildings. It has been the custom of the Presidents since Pierce's administration to occupy one of the smaller build ings of the Home as a summer-resort, and here President Lincoln passed some of the last hours of his eventful term. N. of the Asylum grounds is one of the National Cemeteries, in which 5,424 soldiers are buried. The Asylum for the Insane (of the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia) occupies one of the highest emi nences in the vicinity of Washington (reached by crossing the Navy-Yard bridge and ascending the heights beyond Uniontown). The building is an immense struct ure, 711 ft. long, in the collegiate Gothic style, and stands in grounds 400 acres in extent. The Columbia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb occupies the old Kendall Green estate N. E. of the city. It furnishes instruction to both sexes, and has a collegiate department, The main building is a handsome specimen of Gothic, archi tecture. Public Squares, Cemeteries, etc. \u2014 The finest public square in the city is Lafayette Square in Pennsylvania Ave. N. of the White House. It is laid out in winding paths and filled with trees and shrubbery. In the centre stands Clark Mills's bronze equestrian statue of General Jackson, cast from cannon taken by Jackson in his battles with the British and Spaniards. The statue is remarkable for its delicate balancing, which was effected by making the flanks and tail of the horse of solid metal. The Capitol Grounds have already been described. Judiciary Square lies N. of the City Hall on 44 St. At the cor. of Connecticut Ave. and I St. is Farra gut Square, which is soon to be adorned with a statue of Admiral Farragut. Raw lins Square is a pretty little inclosure on New York Ave. near 18th St. The Congressional Cemetery is about 1 m. E. of the Capitol, near the Eastern Branch. Its situation is high, and commands fine views. It contains several mon uments of interest, among which are those of George Clinton, Elbridge Gerry, Wil liam Wirt, Major-General Macomb, Major-General Jacob Brown, Commodore Chauncey, and Hon. A. P. Upshur. There are about 150 cenotaphs erected to the memory of Congressmen who have died during their term of service. Glenwood, a pleasant rural burying-ground, lies about 1 m. N. of the Capitol. Oak Hill Ceme tery will be described in connection with Georgetown. \u2014 The celebrated Long Bridge crosses the Potomac into Virginia from foot of 14th St. It is a shabby wooden structure about 1 m. long. Benning's Bridge and Navy-Yard Bridge cross the Eastern Branch into Maryland."], [68, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 50 Georgetown (Union Hotel) is an old and picturesque town, distant but 2 m. from the Capitol, and divided only by Rock Creek from Washington City, with which it is connected by 4 bridges and 2 lines of horse-cars. The town is beautifully situ ated on a range of hills which command a view unsurpassed in the Potomac Valley. It was laid out in 1751 by act of the colonial government of Maryland, and was in corporated in 1789. It is the port of entry of the District, and a line of steamships plies between it and New York. One of the chief points of interest is Georgetown College, at the W. end of the town. This is an old institution of learning (founded in 1789 and incorporated as a university in 1815), and the most famous belonging to the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. It is under the control of the Jesuits. The buildings are spacious, and contain a library of 30,000 volumes, among which are some extremely rare and curious books, some beautifully illuminated missals, and some rare old MSS. ; an astronomical observatory ; and a museum of natural history. In the rear of the college is a picturesque rural serpentine walk, commanding fine views. The Convent of the Visitation (in Fayette St. near the College) was founded in 1799, and is the oldest house of the order in America. It consists of several fine buildings in a park of 40 acres. Visitors admitted between 11 a. m. and 2 p. m. The Aqueduct, by which the waters of the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal are carried across the Potomac, will repay inspection. It is 1,446 ft. long and 36 ft. high, with 9 granite piers, and cost $2,000,000. There is a carriage-way above the water-course. The canal extends 184 m. to Cumberland, Md., and cost $13,000,000. Oak Hill Cemetery, on the N. E. slopes of the Heights, though con taining but 30 acres, is one of the most beautiful in the country. It contains an elegant Gothic chapel with stained-glass windows and completely overgrown with ivy ; the massive marble mausoleum of W. W. Corcoran ; and several notable mon uments. Many eminent men are buried here, among them Secretary Stanton and Chief-Justice Chase. Arlington House, once the residence of George Washington Parke Custis, the last survivor but one of the Washington family, and later of Gen. Robert E. Lee, occu pies a commanding position on the Virginia side of the Potomac, nearly opposite Georgetown. It stands more than 200 ft. above tide-water, and the view from the portico is among the best this part of the river affords. The lower rooms of the mansion are open to the public, but contain nothing of interest, the collection of pictures and relics having been removed. In the office of the Superintendent a register is kept for visitors, and a record of all who are buried in the National Cem eteries now located on the place. Near the house, and bordering the drive ap proaching from the S., are the graves of a number of officers who died during the war. Close by is a low, massive granite monument under which is a vault contain ing the bones of 2,111 unknown soldiers, gathered after the war from the battle fields between Bull Run and the Rappahannock. Near this is an amphitheatre with sittings for 5,000 persons, where are held the annual services of Decoration day. The graves of the white soldiers are W. of the house; those of the colored troops and refugees about J m. N. There are about 15,000 in all. In the eastern division of the first Cemetery, within a small inclosure, are the monuments of George Washington Parke Custis and his wife Mary L. Custis. Arlington may be reached by way of the Long Bridge, or by the Aqueduct Bridge from Georgetown. Alexandria is situated on the S. side of the Potomac 7 m. below Washington (reached by railroad, or by ferry-boats hourly from 7th St. wharf). It is a quaint old town, dating from 1748, and is intimately associated with the life and name of Washing ton. In Christ Church (cor. Washington and Cameron Sts.) the pew in which he sat (No. 59) is an object of much interest. Pew No. 46 was occupied by General Robert E. Lee when he resided at Arlington before the war. The Museum, Court- House, Odd-Fellows' Hall, and Theological Seminary, are among the prominent buildings. On the outskirts of the city is a National Cemetery in which nearly 4,000 soldiers are buried. Mount Vernon is 15 m. below Washington, on the Virginia side of the Potomac, and is reached by steamers which leave the 7th St. wharf daily at 10 a. m. (fare for the round trip, including admission to the grounds, $1.50). The sail down the river is"], [69, "NEW YORK TO ALBANY. 51 delightful, and affords excellent views of the country around Washington. Mount Vernon, then known as the \"Hunting Creek estate,\" was bequeathed by Augustine Washington, who died in 1743, to Lawrence Washington. The latter named it after Admiral Vernon, under whom he had served in the Spanish wars, and for whom he cherished a strong affection George Washington inherited the estate in 1752. The central part of the mansion, which is of wood, was built by Lawrence and the wings by George Washington. It contains many interesting historical relies, among which are the key of the Bastile, presented by Lafayette, portions of the military and personal furniture of Washington, portraits, and Rembrandt Peale's painting of \"Washington before Yorktown.\" The Tomb of Washington stands in a retired situation near the mansion. It is a plain but solid brick structure, with an iron gate, through the bars of which may be seen the marble sarcophagi containing the remains of George and Martha Washington. The Mount Vernon domain (includ ing the mansion and 6 acres), which had remained since the death of Washington in the possession of his descendants, was purchased in 1856 for the sum of $200,000, raised by subscription, under the auspices of the \"Ladies' Mount Vernon Associa tion,\" aided by the efforts of Edward Everett. It is, therefore, and will continue to be, the property of the nation. NEW YORK TO ALBANY. ( Via steamer up the Hudson River. Distance, 14S m. Time, 10 hrs. Fare, $2.

Tins journey will afford the traveler advantageous views of some of the most picturesque scenery in America. The Hudson has been compared to the Rhine, and what it lacks in crumbling ruin and castle-crowned steep it more than makes up by its greater variety and superior size. George William Curtis says of it : \" The Danube has in part glimpses of such grandeur, the Elbe has sometimes such deli cately-penciled effects; but no European river is so lordly in its bearing, none flows in such state to the sea.\" The first few miles of the steamer's course afford fine views of the harbor and city, of the Jersey shore, and the northern suburbs. Before the city is fairly left behind, the Palisades loom up on the 1., a series of grand precipices rising in many places to the height of 300 ft. and stretching in unbroken line along the river-bank for more than 20 m. The rock is trap, columnar in formation, and the summit is thickly wooded. In striking contrast with the desolate and lonely appearance of these cliffs, the right bank presents a continuous succession of beautiful villas stand ing in the midst of picturesque and exquisitely-kept grounds, with a frequent sprinkling of villages and hamlets. Yonkers (17 m.) is a fashionable suburban town beautifully situated at the mouth of the Neperan or Saw-Mill River. It is an an cient settlement, and was the home of the once famous Phillipse family, of which was Mary Phillipse, Washington's first love. The Manor-House, a spacious stone edifice built in 1682, is still to be seen. In 1777 a naval action occurred in front of Yonkers between the American gunboats and the British frigates Ross and Ph\u0153nix. Piermont (22 m.) is on the 1. bank at the end of the Palisades; it takes its name from a pier 1 m. long which runs out from the shore to the deep channel. Three m. S. W. of Piermont is the old town of lappan, interesting as having been one of Washington's chief headquarters during the Revolution, and also as the spot where Major Andre, was imprisoned and executed. The house occupied by Washington and the jail of the ill-fated officer are still in good preservation. On the r., 2 m. above Piermont, is the residence of Mr. Cottinet, built of Caen stone, and said to be the most elegant house on the river. Just above, still on the r., is Irvington, named in honor of Washington Irving, whose unique little stone cottage, Sunnyside, is close by, on the margin of the river, but hidden from view by the dense growth of trees and shrubbery. The steamer has now entered the famous Tappan Zee, in which the river broadens out into a beautiful lake 10 in. long and 3 m. wide at the widest part, surrounded by picturesque and pleasing scenery. Upon a high prom-"], [70, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 52 ontory to the r. stands the Paulding Manor, the most conspicuous dwelling on the lower Hudson. It is of white marble in the pointed Tudor style. _ One and a half m. above is Tarrytown, a prosperous town which has many attractions historical as well as scenic. It was at a spot now in the heart of the town that Andre was arrested, and Tarrytown witnessed many stormy fights between guerrillas on both sides during the Revolution. It takes its chief interest, however, from its associa tion with Irving's life and memory. Here is the church which he attended and of which he was warden at the time of his death, here he is buried, and near by are the scenes of some of his happiest fancies. Opposite Tarrytown is Nyack, a pretty little town prettily situated. Sing Sing (33 m.) is on the r. hank, occupying an elevated slope, and makes a fine appearance from the river. The State Prison is located here, and its huge stone buildings are conspicuous objects. Many fine country-seats crown the heights above and around Sing Sing ; and 4 m. above is Croton Point, a prominent headland dividing the Tappan Zee from Haverstraw Bay, another' lake-like widening of the river. Passing this point, the Highlands begin to be visible in the distance. At the head of Haverstraw Bay are Stony Point, on the 1., a rocky peninsula on which are a lighthouse and the ruins of an old Revolutionary fort, and Verplanck's Point, on the r., notable as the spot where Hendrick Hudson's ship, the Half Moon, first came to anchor after leaving Yonkers. Peekskill (43 m.) is a flourishing town at the mouth of the Peekskill or Annskill Creek. Opposite is Caldwell's Landing, memorable for the search so seriously and actively made for the treasure which the famous Captain Kidd was supposed to have secreted at the bottom of the river here. Remains of the apparatus used for this purpose are still visible. At this point the river makes a sudden turn to the W., which is called the Race. We have now reached the Highlands, and for the next 16 m. the scenery is un surpassed in the world. On the 1. is Dunderberg Mountain, and at its base a broad deep stream which, a short distance above its mouth, makes its descent to the river in a beautiful cascade. On the r. is Anthony's Nose, a rocky promontory rising to the height of 1,128 ft., and whose base has been tunneled by the railway a length of 200 ft. Two m. above (on the r.) is Sugar-Loaf Mountain, with an elevation of 865 ft. Near by, and reaching far out into the river, is a sandy bluff on which Fort Independence once stood. Farther on is Iona Island, and in the extreme dis tance Bear Mountain. Buttermilk Falls now come into view on the ]., descending over inclined ledges a distance of 100 ft. Just above, in the heart of the Highland Pass, is Cozzens's Hotel, a spacious and elegant summer hotel, situated on a high bluff. West Point (51 m.), on account of its famous military school and historic associations, and for its varied scenic attractions, is one of the most charming places on the Hudson, and the traveler should stop here for a day, at least, if he have time. The buildings occupy a broad plateau, 150 ft. above the river, and are reached by a steep and costly road cut out of the solid cliff-side. Cro'-Nest, above West Point, on the same side of the river, is one of the loftiest of the Highland group (1,428 ft.). It is the scene of Rodman Drake'6 poem, \"The Culprit Fay.\" Storm King or Butter Hill (\" Boterberg \") is the next mountain-crest, and the last of the Highland range upon the W. , It is 1,529 ft. high. Between Cro'-Nest and Storm King, and in the laps of both, is the lovely vale of Tempe. Cold Spring, on the r., is an exceedingly picturesque village. It is built upon a steep ascent, and behind it is the massive granite crown of Bull Hill. Beyond Cold Spring, and still on the E. bank of the river, the Highland range is continued in the jagged preci pices of the Breakneck and Beacon Hill, in height, respectively, 1,187 and 1,685 ft. These mountains are among the most commanding features of the river-scenery. Cornwall, a rugged and picturesque little place on the 1. bank, is the chief summer resort on the river. Here is the end of the Highlands, and the steamer enters the broad expanse of Newburg Bay, on the 1. shore of which is Newburg, a prosper ous and beautifully-situated city of 18,000 inhabitants. Newburg was the theatre of many interesting events during the Revolution, and Washington's Headquarters, an old gray stone mansion, S. of the town, is still preserved. Opposite is Fishkill Landing, a small but pretty village. Poughkeepsie (75 m.) is the largest city be-"], [71, "ALBANY. 53 tween New York and Albany, and has 22.000 inhabitants. Its situation is com manding and attractive, and the city makes a fine appearance from the river. Here are Vassar College and other famous educational institutions. Above Pough keepsie, on either bank, are many pleasant towns and fine country-seats, among the latter, Rokeby, the estate of the late William B. Astor, and Montgomery Place, the residence of Edward Livingston, and one of the finest on the Hudson. Catskill (110 in.) is the point where we leave the river to visit the celebrated Catskill Moun tains, which for 10 m. have been looming up grandly on the 1. Hudson (115 m.) is a flourishing town of 13,000 inhabitants, finely situated on the E. bank. The heights back of the town command noble views of the Catskill Mts. Between Hud son and Albany there is nothing to call for special mention, though the scenery still remains pleasing. ALBANY. Hotels: Delavan House ($4.50 a day), in Broadway, near the R. R. depot; Con gress Hall (f.4 a day), near the Capitol ; Stanwix Hall ($3 a day) ; American; City. ALBANY, the capital of New York State, is finely situated on the W. bank of the Hudson River at the head of sloop-navigation, and near the head of tide water. It was founded by the Dutch, first as a trading-post, on Castle Island. Albany from Greonbush. directly below the site of the present city, in 1614. Fort Orange was built where the city now stands, in 1623, and, next to Jamestown in Virginia, was the earliest European settlement in the original 13 States. The town was known as Beaver Wyck, and as Williamstadt, before it received its present name in honor of the Duke of York and Albany (afterward James II.), when it fell into the possession of the British in 1664. It was chartered in 1686, and made the State capital in 1798, since which time the population has increased from 5,349 (in 1800) to above 80,000 in 1875. Albany has a large commerce, from its position at the head of navigation on the river, as the entrepot of the great Erie Canal from the W., and the Cham plain Canal from the N., and as the centre to which several important railroads con verge. The boats of the canal are received in a great basin constructed in the 51"], [72, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 54 river, with the help of a pier 80 ft. wide and 4,300 ft. long. A handsome iron-truss railroad-bridge, 1,014 ft. long, spans the river from the foot of Exchange St. The Water- Works, built in 1852-'53, at a cost of $1,000,000, are worth seeing. State Street ascends in a steep grade from the water to the height crowned by Capitol Square, in which are the public buildings. The Old Capitol, a plain brown stone structure, built in 1807, is still occupied, but will be demolished as soon as the costly new Capitol is finished. The New Capitol, to the W. of the old, was corn- New Capitol. menced in 1871, and is slowly rising. It is of Maine granite, in the Renaissance style, and when completed will be the largest and most splendid edifice in America, excepting the Federal Capitol at Washington. Its site is on the most elevated ground in the city, and its tower, 320 ft. high, will be visible for many miles around. The State Library, a handsome fire-proof building, fronting on State St., in rear of the old Capitol, contains 86,000 volumes, and an interesting col lection of curiosities and historical relics, including Washington's dress-sword and pistol. State Hall, in Eagle St., built of white marble in 1843, at a cost of $350,000, contains several of the principal offices of State. The City Hall, in Eagle St., foot of Washington Ave., a beautiful structure of white marble, was finished in 1832. It is 100 ft. front by 80 ft. deep, 3 stories high, and has a recessed portico in front of the second and third stories, supported by six Ionic columns. In S. Pearl St. is the new City Building, erected in 1870 at a cost of $200,000, and containing various offices of the city government. The Merchants' Exchange is a substantial structure at the foot of State St. The State Arsenal, cor. Eagle and Hud son Sts., is a large, gloomy structure in the castellated style. Dudley Observatory,"], [73, "ALBANY TO ROCHESTER AND BUFFALO. 55 founded and liberally endowed by Mrs. Blandina Dudley, stands on Observatory Hill, near the N. limits of the city. It has a valuable special library, and some fine instruments. The Medical College, cor. Eagle and Jay Sts., is a prosperous institu tion, with an extensive museum. The Law School of the Albany University is near by, and is one of the best in the country. The State Normal School, \" for the edu cation and practice of teachers of common schools in the science of education and the art of teaching,\" stands on the cor. of Lodge and Howard Sts. The Young Men's Association, 38 State St., has a library of 12,000 volumes and a well-supplied reading-room. Apprentices' Library has 5,000 volumes. The Abany Institute, organized in 1791, has 9,000 volumes. The edifice in State St., where are deposited the public collections in Natural History, Geology, and Agriculture, is most inter esting. Of the 54 churches in the city, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, in Eagle St., and the Church of St. Joseph, cor. Ten Broeck and 2d Sts., are the most prominent structures. The Cathedral has sittings for 4,000 persons, and a powerful organ. The stained-glass windows, by Gibson, of New York, are among the richest in the country. St. Peter's (Episcopal), cor. Lodge and State Sts., is a handsome structure, in the Gothic style, and has a service of communion-plate presented by Queen Anne for the Onondaga Indians. The Penitentiary, situated W. of the city, about 1 m. from the Capitol, is a model prison, conducted on the contract system, and the only one in the State which is self-sustaining. In the N. part of the city, extending from Broadway to the river, surrounded by extensive and beautiful grounds, is the Van Rensselaer Manor-House, one of the most attractive town residences in the State. It is more than 200 years since the man sion of the first Patroon was erected upon this spot, and portions of the present house were built in 1765. Above the city, on the flats, is the Schuyler House, an exceed ingly plain and antiquated dwelling. Here resided Colonel Peter Schuyler, the first Mayor of Albany, the Indian commissioner who took four Mohawk sachems to Eng land and presented them to Queen Anne. The house was burned down in 1759, and immediately rebuilt, portions of the original walls remaining. In 1869, the old burial-grounds, penitentiary-grounds, almshouse farm, and Washington parade ground, in the W. part of the city, were set apart for a public park, to be known as \" Washington Park ; \" but little work on it has yet been done. Albany Rural Ceme tery, a pleasant burial-ground, lies N. of the city. Greenbush is a populous sub urb on the opposite side of the river. While in Albany, the traveler should embrace the opportunity to visit Itoy (6 miles above), a beautiful city of 46,000 inhabitants, noted for its extensive manu factures, which include iron-works on the largest scale, car-works, and cotton, wool en, hosiery, and shoe factories. There are several fine churches and public buildings, and many handsome private residences. The buildings of St. Joseph's Theological Seminary, on Mt. Ida, E. of the city, are noble specimens of Byzantine architecture. The great Watervliet Arsenal is also situated here ; there are 40 buildings in a park of 105 acres. Troy is reached from Albany by either steam or horse cars. ALBANY TO ROCHESTER AND BUFFALO. {Via New York^Central E. R., distance 229 and 2i>8 m\u00bb respectively.) The New York Central R. R. traverses trom E. to W. the entire length of the Empire State, passing through the rich midland counties. It has two termini at the eastern end, one at Albany and the other at Troy, the branches meeting after 17 ra. at Schenectady. It then continues in one line to Syracuse, 148 m. from Albany, where it again divides and is a double route for the remainder of the way: the lower line, via Auburn and Canandaigua being looped up to the other at Rochester. The upper route is the more direct, and the one we shall now follow. The great Erie Canal traverses the State from Albany to Buffalo, nearly in the same line with the railroad. Schenectady, already mentioned as the point of junction between the two branch lines, is one of the oldest towns in the State, and is distinguished as the site of Union College, founded in 1795. The site of the present town once formed the council-"], [74, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 56 grounds of the Mohawks. Leaving Schenectady. the road crosses the Mohawk River and the Erie Canal on a bridge nearly 1,000 ft. long. Little Falls (74 m.) is remarkable for a bold passage of the river and canal through a wild and most pict uresque defile. The scenery includes the river, rapids, and cascades, the locks and windings of the canal, and the bridges ; and the glimpses far away up the valley of the Mohawk are especially beautiful. Crica (95 m.) is a large and handsome city on the S. bank of the Mohawk, standing upon the site of old Fort Schuyler. The State Lunatic Asylum is located here, and consists of several stone edifices. The manufactures are extensive. Rome (110 m.) is a flourishing tow^n of 11,000 in habitants, and contains several fine buildings, the handsomest of which is the Semi nary. Oneida (122 m.) is on the shore of Oneida Lake, a beautiful sheet of water, abounding in fish, and surrounded by some of the most fertile and highly-cultivated land in the State. Syracuse (148 m.) is one of the largest cities in the State, having a population of nearly 55,000. It is pleasantly situated on the S. end of Onondaga Lake, and contains the most extensive salt-manufactories in the United States. It is famous as the meeting-place of political and other conventions. Between Syra cuse and Rochester, there are 7 small towns which need not be specially mentioned. Between Rochester and Buffalo, the only one calling for notice is Batavia (261 m. from Albany), which is the site of the State Institution for the Blind, one of the finest structures of its kind in the country. The town is laid out in broad streets, which are beautifully shaded. ROCHESTER. Hiti'l-: The Osborn House, in Main St.; the Brackets House and Congress Hall, near the R. R. depot; the Clinton House, in State St. ROCHESTER is situated on both sides of the Genesee Kiver, 7 m. from its month in Lake Ontario. Soon after it enters the city the river makes a rapid descent, there being a perpendicular fall of 96 ft. near the centre, and two others of 25 ft. and 84 ft. near the northern limit. It is to the prodigious water power thus afforded that much of the prosperity of the city is attributable, and it contains several of the largest flour-mills in the country. Other important indus tries are the production of clothing, boots and shoes, engines and boilers, agricultural implements, trees, and garden and flower seeds. The immense nurseries in which these latter are produced are well worth a visit (reached by South Ave.). Rochester was first settled in 1810, was incorporated as a city in 1834, and in 1875 had a popu lation of 81,813. The streets are nearly all laid out at right angles, many of them are well paved with stone, and most of them are bordered with shade-trees. Nearly all the dwellings are built separate from each other, and surrounded by a bit of cul tivated or ornamental ground. Main St. is the principal thoroughfare ; it is known as Buffalo St. in one part of its course. The new City Hall, in W. Main St., is a handsome building of gray lime stone, 138 ft. long and 80 ft. wide, with a tower 175 ft. high. Back of this is the County Court-House, of brick with limestone trimmings, three stories high. In the same vicinity is the new Free Academy, a large brick building with sandstone trim mings, 4 stories high. At the cor. of Buffalo and State Sts. are the Powers Bnildings, a tubular block of stores, built of stone, glass, and iron, 7 stories high. In the upper halls is a fine collection of paintings, and on the top is a tower (open to visitors) from which may be obtained a fine view of the city and its surroundings. Near the Powers Buildings is the Arcade, roofed over with glass and containing numerous shops. The finest church edifice in the city is St. Patrick's Cathedral (Roman Catholic), which is in the Gothic style, of red sandstone trimmed with gray limestone. The University of Rochester was founded by the Baptists in 1850, and in 1875 had 9 professors and 160 students. It is situated in the E. part of the city (on University Ave.), where it has 23J acres beautifully laid out, and occupies a massive building of red sandstone. The library contains 12,000 volumes, and the geological cabinets, collected by Prof. Henry A. Ward, are said to be the finest in the country. The library and cabinets are deposited in a handsome fire-proof"], [75, "BUFFALO. 57 building recently finished. There is also a Baptist Theological Seminary, founded in 1850. Its library numbers more than 10,000 volumes, including 4,000 which constituted the , - - library of Nean der, the German church histori an. The Athe n\u00e6um, in Buffa lo St., has a li brary of 20,000 volumes. The City Hospital (Buffalo St.) has a fine building with accommo dations for 120 patients. St. Mary's Hospital (in West Ave.) is an imposing edifice of cut stone with ac commodations for 1,000 pa tients. The View of West Main Street. Western House of Refuge, a State institution, is an extensive brick building sur rounded by grounds 42 acres in extent, about 1 m. N. from the centre of the city. Other points of interest are Mount Hope Cemetery, picturesquely situated on a group of rounded hills in the S. part of the city (reached by horse-cars) ; and the cut-stone Aqueduct, 848 ft. long with a channel 45 ft. wide, by which the Erie Canal is car ried across the Genesee River. The Genesee Falls are seen to the best advantage from the E. side of the stream. The railroad cars pass about 100 rods S. of the most southerly fall, so that passen gers in crossing lose the view. To view the scene properly, the visitor should cross the bridge over the Genesee above the mill, and place himself immediately in front of the fall. By descending a stairway to the bottom of the ravine the impressive ness of the view is greatly increased. The first fall is 80 rods below the Aqueduct, and is 96 ft. high. From Table Rock, in the centre of it, Sam Patch made his last and fatal leap. The river below the first cataract is broad and deep, with occa sional rapids to the second fall, where it again descends perpendicularly 25 ft. A short distance below is the third fall, which is 84 ft. high. BUFFALO. Hotels . The best are the Mansion House and the Tifft House, in Main St. Good ones are Bonny's Hotel, cor. Washington and Carrol Sts.; and the Continental near the depot. BUFFALO, the third city in size in the State of New York, is situated at the mouth of Buffalo Creek and head of Niagara River, at the E. end of Lake Erie, and possesses the largest and finest harbor on the lake. It is also the terminus of the Erie Canal, the New York Central R. R., and six other railroads connecting it with all parts of the country. The city has a water-front of about 5 miles, half of which is upon the Lake and half upon Niagara River. Its commerce is very large, as its position at the foot of the great chain of lakes makes it the entrepot for a large part of the traffic between the East and the great Northwest. During the year 1872 the number ot vessels entered and cleared was 10,303, with an aggregate tonnage of 4,678,058 tons. The manufactures are also large, the most important"], [76, "58 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. being of iron, tin, brass, and copper ware. Malting and brewing, for which the climate is highly favorable, are extensively carried on. Buffalo was first settled in 1801 ; it became a military post during the War of 1812, and was burned by a force of Indians and British in 1814; and it was incorporated as a city in 1832. Since the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 its growth has been very rapid, and in 1870 it had a population of 117,714. Pop. in 1875, 134,573. Buffalo, in the main, is handsomely built. Its streets are broad and straight, and for the most part laid out at right angles. Main, Niagara, and Delaware Sts. are the principal thoroughfares. The streets in the more elevated portions of the city are bordered with a profusion of shade-trees, and the more important avenues have many fine residences. Shade-trees adorn the public squares, 5 in all, named respec- Buffalo, from the Spire of the Presbyterian Cburch in Delaware Street. tively Niagara, Lafayette Place, Franklin, Washington, Delaware Place, and Terrace Parks. A portion of the river-front is a bold bluff, 60 ft. above the level of the river, and the more elevated portions afford fine views of the city, river, lake, Canada shore, and the hilly country to the S. E. The prominent public buildings are: the Custom-House and Post-Office, a large but plain freestone edifice, at the cor. of Washington and Eagle Sts. ; the State Arsenal, a handsome turreted structure of stone in Batavia St. ; the State Armory in Virginia St., a large plain edifice of brick ; the Erie County Penitentiary, a capacious building of brick and stone ; and the General Hospital, in High St., of which only one wing has been erected. A fine granite court-house and city-hall, fronting on Franklin St., is in process of con struction, and is estimated to cost nearly $1,000,000. Several of the bank buildings in the city are costly and imposing edifices, especially those of the Erie County, the Buffalo City, and the Western savings-banks. The most notable church edifices are St. Panl's Cathedral (Episcopal), in Pearl St., built of red sandstone in the early English style and containing a fine chime of bells ; St. Joseph's Cathedral (Roman Catholic) in Franklin St., of blue-stone trimmed with white-stone, in the florid Gothic style, and having a chime of 42 bells; St. Peter's (Episcopal) in Main St. near Franklin Square; the North and Central Presbyterian, in Main St.; the Presbyterian in Delaware St., which has a lofty spire ; and the New Universalist. The leading educational institutions are the Medical College of the University of Buffalo, in Main St. ; Canisius College, a Jesuit institution, occupying a handsome building of stone"], [77, "NEW YORK TO BOSTON. 59 and brick in Washington St. near Tupper; St. Joseph's College, on the terrace in the rear of St. Joseph's Cathedral, a flourishing institution, conducted by the Christian Brothers; St. Mary's Academy, on the same square, in Franklin and Church Sts.; the Buffalo Female Academy, in Delaware St.; the Heathcote School, in Pearl St., a classical academy established under the patronage of the Episcopal Church ; and the State Normal School, in North St., a large and imposing building. The Young Men's Association (cor. Main and Eagle Sts.) has a circulating library of 28,000 vol umes and a well-supplied reading-room. In the same building are the Buffalo His torical Society, with a large library and cabinets ; the Society of Natural Sciences, which has a very complete and valuable collection of minerals, a good botanical and conchological cabinet, and a complete set of Prof. Ward's fossil casts ; the Academy of Fine Arts, which is founding a fine gallery of painting and sculpture ; and the Me chanics' Institute. Adjoining the library building is St. James's Hall, where lectures, concerts, etc., are given. The Grosvenor Library is a public library for reference, founded by a bequest of Seth Grosvenor, of New York. It is liberally endowed, and contains about 12,000 volumes, chiefly important books not easy of access else where. The Church Charity Foundation (Episcopal), in Rhode Island St. near Niagara, is a fine building, embracing a home for aged and destitute women, and an orphan ward. The Ingleside Home, with an excellent building in Seneca St., is designed for the reclamation of fallen women, and has been very successful since its organization in 1849. The Buffalo Orphan Asylum (Protestant) has a commodious building in Virginia St. ; and the St. Vincent Female Orphan Asylum, cor. Batavia and Ellicott Sts., and the St. Joseph's Boys' Orphan Asylum, at Lundstone Hill, are large and successful Roman Catholic institutions. The State Insane Asylum, in process of construction, will be the largest institution of the kind in the United States if not in the world; it will have a front of about 2,700 ft. The grounds attached to it embrace 203 acres, and are laid out in harmony with the plan of the Buffalo Park, which they adjoin. A superb public Park, or system of parks, has been designed and laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted, the architect of Central Park, in New York City. The land embraces about 530 acres ; and is divided into three plots, situated in the western, northern, and eastern parts of the city, with broad boulevards connecting them, forming a continuous drive of nearly 10 m. The Forest Lawn Cemetery, bounded on two sides by the park, is tastefully laid out and contains some fine monuments. From Black Rock, a suburb of Buffalo (reached by Niagara St.), the magnificent International Bridge, completed in 1873 at a cost of $1,500,000, crosses the Niagara River to the Canadian village of Fort Erie. Niagara Falls may be visited from Buffalo (23 m.), via Erie R. R. No visitor should leave Buffalo without having seen the great canal-basins, the piers, the grain-elevators, and some of the iron-works. The spacious passenger de pots of the Central and Erie R.R. and the immense freight depots of the same roads are also worth a visit. NEW YORK TO BOSTON. (Via Pall River Steamers and Old Colony R.R. Distance. 230 m. Time, 10 to 12 hours. Fare, $4. The steamers leave Pier 28, North River, foot of Murray St., daily, Sundays excepted, at 4.30 P. H. There are two all-rail roules from New York to Boston, via New Haven & Providence, and via New Haven, Hartford & Springfield, both of which are briefly described elsewhere. See \"New York to New Haven,\" \"New Haven to Providence,\" and \"New Haven to Hartford.\" There are also two other steamboat routes. The \" Stonington Line,\" via steamers leaving Pier 33, North River, daily, at 4.30 p.m., and connecting at New London with the Stonington & Providence R. R. : and the \"Norwich Line \" of steamers, leaving Pier 40, North River, daily, and connecting at New London with the New York &]New England R. R. [jThe first mentioned is the best steamer route, and is here described.) The steamers Bristol and Providence, of the Fall River line, are among thelargest and most splendid in American waters, and there are few trips more enjoyable than that part of the present journey which is made on them. Their route, in leav ing New York, is such as to afford an excellent view of the harbor and city, of Brooklyn and the Long Island shore, of the islands in the East River, of the famous Hell Gate, and of the tranquil' waters of Long Island Sound. The greater part of"], [78, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 60 the voyage is on these waters, and, when Point Judith is passed and the turbulent Atlantic entered upon, the steamer's destination is close at hand. One stopping is made between New York and Fall River, namely at Newport, which is reached at a very early hour in the morning. The remainder of the voyage is over the beauti ful Narragansett Bay; and at Fall River, which is one of the leading cities of Mas sachusetts, especially noted for the extent of its manufactures, passengers are trans ferred to the cars of the Old Colony R. R. From Fall River, the distance to Boston is 49 m., and the route is through a well-cultivated and populous farming country, with no special scenic attractions. Many towns and villages are clustered along the line, the principal of which are Taunton, another prosperous manufacturing centre, and Quincy, a beautiful old town, noteworthy as the home of the Adams and Quincy families. Leaving Quincy, the train crosses the Neponset River, runs through Dorchester and S. Boston, and soon enters the depot at the cor. of Knee land and South Sts. There is another line from Fall River to Boston via Bridgewa ter, which is the same as the one here described, except that Taunton is not passed. BOSTON. BOSTON, the capital of Massachusetts, and chief city of New England, is situated at the W. extremity of Massachusetts Bay, in latitude 42\u00b0 N. and longitude 71\u00b0 W. The city embraces Boston proper, East Boston, South Boston, Roxbury, Dor chester, Charlestown, Brighton, and West Roxbury. Boston proper, or old Bos ton, occupies a peninsula of some 700 acres, very uneven in surface, and originally presenting three hills, Beacon, Copp's, and Fort, the former of which is about 130 ft. above the sea. The Indian name of this peninsula was Shawmut, meaning \" Sweet Waters.\" It was called by the earlier settlers Trimountain or Tremont. A nar row strip of land called the \" Neck \" joined the peninsula to the mainland ; this neck has been filled in and widened, and is now thickly built upon. East Boston occu pies the W. portion of Noddle's or Maverick's Island. Here is the deepest water of the harbor, and here the ocean-steamers chiefly lie. The wharf formerly used by the Cunard steamers is 1,000 ft. long. South Boston extends about 2 m. along the S- side of the harbor, an arm of which separates it from Boston proper. Near the centre are Dorchester Heights, which attain an elevation of about 130 ft. above the ocean, and afford a fine view of the city, bay, and surrounding country. The city is connected with Charlestown by the Charles River bridge, 1,503 ft. long, and the Warren bridge, 1,300 ft. long ; and with Cambridge by the West Boston bridge, which crosses Charles River from Cambridge St., Boston, and is 2,756 ft. long, with a causeway 3,432 ft. long. Craigie's bridge, 2,796 ft. long, extends from Leverett St. to E. Cambridge; from this bridge another, 1,820 ft. long, extends to Prison Point, Charlestown. South Boston is reached by the Federal St. bridge, about 500 ft. long, and the South Boston Bridge, 1,550 ft. long. All these bridges are free. A causeway, built across Back Bay on a substantial dam 14/ m. long, extends from the foot of Beacon St. to Sewell's Point in Brookline. The harbor is a spacious indentation of Massachusetts Bay, embracing about 75 sq. m., including several arms, such as Dorchester Bay, South Boston Hay, and the embouchures of the Charles, Mystic, and Neponset Rivers. A part of Charles River is commonly known as Back Bay. There are more than 50 islands or islets in the harbor, and it offers many picturesque views. The first white inhabitant of Boston was the Rev. John Blackstone, supposed to have been an Episcopal clergyman, and to have arrived in 1623. Here he lived alone until 1630, when John Winthrop (afterward the first Governor of Massachu setts) came across the river from Charlestown, where he had dwelt with some fellow immigrants for a short time. About 1635 Mr. Blackstone sold his claim to the now populous peninsula for \u00a330, and removed to Rhode Island. The first church was built in 1632 ; the first wharf in 1673. Four years later a postmaster was appoint ed, and in 1704 (April 24th) the first newspaper, called the Boston News Letter, was published. The \" Boston Massacre \" happened March 5, 1770, when 3 persons were killed and 5 wounded by the fire of the soldiery.

By the View of Boston from the Harbor. recent annexation of the suburbs of Brighton, Charlestown, W. Roxbury, etc., the population has been increased to 341,919 (in February, 1876). On the 9th of November, 1872, one of the most terrible conflagrations ever known in the United States swept away the principal business portion of Boston. The fire broke out on Saturday evening, and continued until noon on the following day, when it was brought under control, but again broke forth in consequence of an explosion of gas, about midnight, and raged until 7 o'clock Monday morning. The district burned over extended from Summer and Bedford Sts. on the S. to near State St. on the N., and from Washington St. east to the harbor. About 800 of the finest buildings in the city were destroyed, causing a loss of $80,000,000.

This famous edifice, the \"cradle of liberty,\" is in Dock Square, which also has an historical reputation because of the meetings of the Revolutionary patriots that"], [81, ", BOSTON. 63 were held there. The building was erected in 1742, by Peter Faneuil, a Huguenot merchant, and by him presented to the town. Its original dimensions were 100 by 40 ft. Destroyed by fire'in 1761, it was rebuilt in 1763, and enlarged to its present dimensions in 1805. A full-length portrait of the founder, together with the pictures of Wash ington, by Stuart, of Webster, by Healy, of Samuel Adams, by Copley. and portraits of John Quincy Adams, Edward Everett, Abraham Lincoln, and Governor Andrew, adorn the walls.

On almost all sides lie picturesque and venerable old towns, and the country between, even when not strictly beautiful, is never fiat and tame. Charlestown, Brighton, Jamaica Plain, and AV. Roxbury, were annexed in 1875, and now form part of the city. Roxbury and Dorchester have been previously annexed. In all of them are the fine villa residences of Boston merchants, and other features of interest which make them worth a visit. At Charlestown, on the N. (reached by horse-cars from Scollay Square), is the famous Bnuker Hill Mounment, occupying the site of the old redoubt at Breed's Hill, and commemorative of the eventful battle fought on the spot, Juno 17, 1775. It is a plain but massive obelisk of Quincy granite, 30 ft square at the base, and 221 ft. high. From the observatory at the top, reached by a spiral flight of 295 steps, is obtained a magnificent view, including the entire vicinity of Boston. The monument was dedicated July 17, 1843, in the presence of President Tyler and his cabinet, on which occasion Daniel W'ebster delivered an ora tion which is considered his finest oratorical effort. In the house near the monument is a fine statue of Genera'. Warren, who was killed on the Hill; and a stone marks the spot where he fell. The U. S. Navy-Yard is also located in Charles town. It comprises about 100 acres, and contains, among other objects of interest, the longest rope walk in the country, and an immense dry-dock. In Chelsea (connected with Boston by ferry, and with Charlestown by a bridge over the Mystic River) are Woodlawn Cemetery, Marine Hospi tal, and Naval Hospital, which have already been described. Chelsea Beach, 5 m. from Bos ton (reached by horse-cars or by Eastern R. R.), Bunker Hill Monument. is a smooth, hard, sandy beach, well adapted for driving or walking. It is much visited by citizens on Sundays and holidays. Brighton, a station on the Albr.ny R. R., 5 m. W. of the city proper, is famous for its cattle-market. Point Shir ley, 5 m. from Boston, affords a pleasant drive. The most direct route is via the E. Boston ferry. Excellent fish and game dinners and suppers may be obtained here, at Taft's Hotel. Brookline is a beautiful town on the New York & New England R. R. (reached also by Causeway from Boston). In it is the Brookline Reservoir, with a capacity of 120,000,000 gallons. About 1 in. dis tant, on the boundaries of Brookline, Brighton, and Newton, is the great Chest nut Hill Reservoir, with a capacity of 800,000,000 gallons. From Boston to and around this point is a favorite drive. The chief attraction of Cambridge (Harvard University) has already been described, but the city itself is well worth a visit. Lexington and Concord are reached by the Lexington Branch R. R. from the Lowell depot. The harbor of Boston, as elsewhere remarked, is one of the best and most spa cious on the coast, and to the summer visitor affords one of the most attractive features of the city. Frequent excursions to different points take place in the sum mer season, and by taking a steamer to Hingham (twice daily from Liverpool 6"], [88, "70 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. Wharf) the principal islands and fortifications may be seen. The most important of these fortifications are, Fort Independence, on Castle Island ; Fort Winthrop on Governor's Island ; and Fort Warren, on George's Island. Deer, Long, Rainsford, Spectacle, Gallop, and Thompson's Islands, are also passed. NEW YORK TO NEW HAVEN. ( Via New York & New Haven R. P.. Distance, 78 m. Time, 2} hrs. Fare, $2.) Leaving the Grand Central Depot, the train runs on the track of the New York & Harlem R. R. as far as Williains's Bridge (14 m.), and then takes the New York & New Haven road, which runs through several pretty suburban towns. Greenwich (31 m.) is the first station in Connecticut, and is pleasantly situated on hill-slopes commanding a fine view of Long Island Sound. Stamford (37 m.) and Norwalk (45 m.) are handsome towns, containing many villas of New York merchants, and are frequented as summer resorts. Fairfield (54 m.) is a highly-popular summer resort, situated about \\ m. from the beach. Bridgeport (59 m.) is a flourishing town of 20,000 inhabitants, situated on an arm of Long Island Sound, and noted for the extent and variety of its manufactures. Several pretty villages are now passed, and as the train approaches New Haven, across extensive salt meadows, West and East Rocks, two abrupt promontories, 400 and 300 ft. in height, are conspicuous objects. NEW ilAVEN. Hotels: The New Haven House, cor. College and Chapel Sts., is the largest and best ($4.00 a day). The Elliot House (cor. Chapel and Olive Sts.) and the Tontine (cor. Church and Court Sts.) are good ($3.00 a day). ~\"VTEW IIAVEN, the largest city in Connecticut, is situated at the head of New 1\\| Haven Bay, 4 m. from Long Island Sound, upon a broad plain surrounded by hills of moderate height. It was settled in 1638 by a colony from London, was a distinct colony until 1665, was incorporated as a city in 1784, and from 1701 to 1875 was one of the capitals of the State. The city is the centre of 5 railroads, and has considerable foreign commerce, chiefly with the West Indies. Its coasting- trade New Haven is also large; and its manufactures are very extensive, including machinery, hard ware, locks, clocks, firearms, carriages, organs, pianos, jewelry, India-rubber goods, etc. The population in 1870 was 50,840. Chapel St., the principal thoroughfare, extends in a W. N. W. direction throughout the length of the city. State and"], [89, "NEW HAVEN. 71 Church are also important business streets, and Hillhonse Ave. is lined with handsome private residences. The number of magnificent elms with which its principal avenues are planted has caused New Haven to be called the \" City of Elms.\" They were mostly set out about the close of the 18th century, by James Hillhouse, or through his influence and example. The public square or \" Green,\" in the centre of the city, is a fine lawn magnificently shaded, and has in it the State-House (where the Legislature assembled on alternate years till 1874), the Centre Church, the North Church, and Trinity Church. In the rear of Centre Church is the grave of the regicide John Dixwell, marked by a' marble monument. On the E. side of the Green is the City HaU, a very handsome building, in which the courts are held, and the city, town, and county have their local offices. The Custom- House, in Church St. hear Chapel, is of Portland ston?, and has apartments for the Post-Office and U. S. courts. The other principal publ c buildings are the Court-House, in Church St., the State Hospital, the Medical College, the Orphan Asylum, the County Prison, and the Almshouse. The last three are in the W. part of the city. Wooster Square, in the E. part, is an inclosure of 5 acres, laid out with remarkable elegance and good taste. The Old Burying- Ground, on Grove St. near High, contains many interesting monuments, among which are those which mark the graves of Theophilus Eaton (first Governor of New Haven Colony), Roger Sherman (signer of the Declaration), Timothy Dwiglft, Benjamin Silliman, and Noah Webster. The Evergreen Cemetery, on the bank of West River, is large and tastefully adorned, and the New Haven Burying- Ground, N. W. of the city, is worth visiting. Across Temple St. from the Green are the grounds of Yale College, one of the old est and most important educational institutions in America. It was founded in 1700, removed to New Haven from Saybrook Point in 1717, and in 1875-'76 had 86 instructors and 1,051 students. Besides its Academic Department, the College has a Law School, a Medical School, a Scientific School, a Theological School, and a School of the Fine Arts. The most noteworthy buildings are the Library, contain- ing 9 0,000 volumes; the Art Building, containing the Trumbull collection of historical paintings, the well - known \" Jarves col lection \" of early Italian pictures, some interesting casts from Greek an tiques, and a few modern works of art; the Alumni Hall, in which are hung por traits of dis- TLe Library. tinguished officers and graduates of the College ; the Old Commons' Hall, containing the great geological cabinets ; and the new buildings, Durfee Hall and Farnum Hall, at the N. end. These buildings are all in College Square. Just N. of it is the handsome structure of the Theological School ; and still farther N., in Grove St., the hall of the Sheffield Scientific School, with its laboratories, library, and scientific collections. The Gymnasium, said to be the most complete in thecountry, is in Library St."], [90, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 72 The East and West Rocks, already mentioned as noticeable in approaching the city, are worth a visit. East Rock (reached by horse-cars from the Green) is 300 ft. high, and affords a wide and beautiful view. A small hotel is on the summit. West Rock (reached by horse- cars from Chapel St.) is 400 ft. high, and also affords an at tractive view. On the top there is a group of bowlders called the \"Judges' Cave \" because Goffe and Whalley, two of the judges of King Charles I., of England, were secreted here for a while in 1661. Near the base of the rock on the N. is Winter green Fall, a pretty cascade. Near by is Maltby Park, 800 acres in extent, contain ing the city water-works and some picturesque drives and rambles. Savin Rock, a bathing-place, with summer hotels, on Long Island Sound, 4 m. S. W. of the city, is a favorite resort (reached by horse-cars from the Green). Sachems' Wood (the Hillbouse residence), at the head of Hillhouse Ave., is a pleasant spot. The most popular drive is down the E. side of the harbor to Forts Hale and Wooster, the latter an old ruin dating from 1814, the former recently dismantled. From the hill on which Fort Wooster stands there is a fine view, shown in our engraving. NEW HAVEN TO HARTFORD. ( Via New Haven, Hartford & Springfield K. R. Distance, 30 m. Time, 1 to HJnr. Fare, $1.10.) This road as far as Springfield, 26 m. beyond Hartford, is one of the main high ways to Boston, and it continues on to the Canadian frontier as the best route from New York to the White Mountains and to Quebec. The valley of the Connecticut. is one of the most beautiful in the country, but the tourist sees but little of the lower river from the cars, the track not running along the river-bank until after passing above Hartford. Three or four pretty towns are passed on the route between New Haven and Hartford, and there is nothing else to challenge attention. HARTFORD. Hotels : The Allyn House, near the depot, is the largest and best ($4 a day). The United States, on State-House Square ($3 a day), and the City Hotel, in Main St. ($3 a day), are good. HARTFORD, the capital of Connecticut, and one of the most beautiful cities in New England, is situated at the head of sloop navigation on the Connecticut River, 50 in. from Long Island Sound. It comprises 10 sq. m., and is about 3J m. long, with an average breadth of 3 m. It is intersected by Park River, which is spanned by 11 bridges. A bridge across the Connecticut, 1,000 ft. long, connects the city proper with East Hartford. Hartford was settled by the Dutch, in 1633, and the site of the first houses, at the junction of the Connecticut and Park Rivers, is still known as \"Dutch Point.\" In 1635 the first English colony settled here. and named the place in honor of Hartford, England, the birthplace of one of their ministers. From 1701 to 1875 Hartford shared with New Haven the honor of being capital of the State, but in the latter year, by virtue of a constitutional amendment, it became the sole capital. The business of Hartford is very extensive, not only on account of its numerous manufactories, but also because it is one of the great centres of fire and life insurance. The aggregate assets of the banking and insurance com panies at the beginning of 1874 were over $135,000,000. The manufactories include iron and brass ware, steam engines and boilers, sewing-machines, firearms, mechan ics' tools, silver-plated ware, stoneware, woolens, envelopes, cigars, fertilizers, and a vast number of other productions. The population in 1870 was 37,180. The city is regularly laid out, part of the streets running nearly parallel to the river, and others crossing them E. and W. Main St., which extends from N. to S. through the principal portion of the city, is the great thoroughfare. On it are the principal public buildings, churches, and retail stores, and for more than a mile it presents an almost unbroken range of brick and stone edifices. State, Commerce, and Asylum Sts., are also the seat of a large and active business. In the out skirts are many tasteful and elegant residences, and the city, as a whole, is remarka-"], [91, "HARTFORD. 73 bly well built. The State-House, an old brick structure, erected in 1794, stands on IState-IIouse Square, and contains the public offices and the State Library. In the secretary's office is the famous charter. In the Senate-chamber is a full-length por trait of Washington, by Stuart, portraits of former colonial and State Governors, and an elegant chair made from the charter-oak. From the cupola on the top of the building there is a fine view. The City Hall is a handsome building in the Gre cian style, fronting on Market St., near State-House Square. The Post-Office is at 252 Main St. The Opera-House (395 Main St.) is an elegant structure with a tasteful interior. The State Arsenal, in the N. section of the city, is a large and stately edifice ; and the Union Depot is one of the finest in New England. The City Park (46 acres) is beautifully situated in a bend of Park River, S. of the depot, and contains a fine bronze statue of Bishop Brownell, and a statue of General Putnam. Here the New State-House, of marble, in the secular Gothic style, is in process of con struction. It is to be 300 ft. long by 200 ft. wide, and 250 ft. high to the top of the New State-House. <lome. Besides spacious chambers for the two Houses of the Legislature, it will contain rooms for the Supreme Court and the State Library. Its estimated cost is $1,500,000. The Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb is beautifully situated on a hill near the depot, in the midst of extensive grounds. It was founded in 1817, and was the first institution of the kind in America. The Retreat for the Insane, founded in 1824, stands upon elevated ground in the S. W. part of the city. It has extensive and highly-ornamented grounds, from which fine views of the city aud of the Con necticut Valley may be obtained. The Hartford Hospital, in Hudson St., near the Retreat, is a handsome building of Portland stone. Among the many fine churches in the city, the most noticeable are: the Church of the (Jood Shepherd (Episcopal), erected by Mrs. Colt as a memorial of her husband and children. It is in the pure Gothic style, with a spire 150 ft. high, and has a rich interior. Christ Church (Episcopal), cor. Main and Church Sts., isa fine specimen of Gothic architecture, as is the Park Church (Congregational). The Pearl St"], [92, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 74 Church (Congregational) has a graceful stone spire. The South Baptist, the First Methodist, and St. Patrick's Cathedral (Roman Catholic), are handsome buildings. The Roman Catholics are erecting a new cathedral in Farrington Ave. The leading educational institution is Trinity College (Episcopal), founded in 1823. In 1874 it had 17 instructors and 94 students, and a library of 7,000 volumes. The buildings, comprising 3 stone halls, called respectively Seabury, Jarvis, and Brownell, are situ ated in Trinity St., near the City Park. These grounds, however, have been sold to the city, the trustees reserving the right to use them until April, 1877, with the exception of Brownell Hall, a portion of which has been demolished to make room tor the new State-House. A new site for the College, about 1 m. S. of the present one, has been purchased. The new High-School, near the Park, and a little S. W. of the depot, and the new Brown School, in Market St., are among the finest school houses in the country. The Theological Institute of Connecticut (Congregational), cor. Prospect St. and Wadsworth Alley, has a library of 7,000 volumes. The Wads worth Athen\u00e6um is a fine granite edifice, in the castellated style, in Main St. The cen tral portion is used as a fine-art gallery, in which are some good pictures and statu ary; in the S. portion are the museum, library (16,000 volumes), and other rooms of the State Historical Society, through which is the entrance to the Watkinson Library, a free public library, containing 27,000 volumes. The N. portion is occu pied by the Young Men's Institute, which has a library of 23,000 volumes. This institution is well worth a visit. Colt's Firearms Manufactory and the Willow Works form a village of themselves in the S. E. portion of the city. The grounds extend from the river to Main St., upon which stands the elegant Colt mansion (\" Armsmear \"), surrounded by im mense greenhouses, graperies, etc. The Ancient Burying- Ground, containing the ashes of the first settlers, is in the rear of Centre Church, in Main St. The largest cemetery is in the N. part of the city ; but the Cedar Grove Cemetery (reached by Main St. horse-cars) should be visited to see the Colt monument, the Beach monu ment, and the fine prospect over the surrounding country. The vicinity of Hartford abounds in picturesque drives and wralks. The favorite drives are to Tumble-down Brook, 8 m. W., on the Albany road ; to Talcott Moun tain, 9 m. W. ; to Prospect Hill ; and to Wethersfield (6 m. N.), the most ancient town on the river. East Hartford (reached by the long bridge) contains some quaint old houses. NEW HAVEN TO PROVIDENCE. (Via Shore Line and Stonington & Providence E. E. Distance. 112 m. Time, Sj-4 hours. The6e roads form a part of one of the principal through-routes between New York and Boston.) Leaving New Haven, the road still runs along the shore of Long Island Sound1 through a country populous and well cultivated but destitute of marked scenic at tractions. Guilford (16 m.) is a pretty town, shaded with fine trees, and much frequented as a summer resort. New London (50 m.) is one of the oldest towns in Connecticut, is largely engaged in the whale-fishery, and is the site of a United States Navy- Yard. It is picturesquely situated, and contains 10,000 inhabitants. Mystic (58 m.) is the site of the celebrated Pequot massacre (May 26, 1637), when the colonists under John Mason annihilated the tribe, burning their forts, and shoot ing down men, women, and children. Stonington (62 m.) is also an old town, is pleasantly situated near the ocean, and is a favorite watering-place. This is the last station in Connecticut, and the only station of importance between it and Provi dence is Westerly (68 m. from New Haven), noted for its extensive manufactures. Providence is 188 m. from New York, by the Shore Line, and is reached also by the \"Stonington Line\" of steamers, by the \"Norwich\" and \"Fall River\" lines, and bv the direct through-line. PROVIDENCE. Hotels: The City Hotel, in Broad St., and the Aldrieli House, near the depot, are the best. The Central, 10 Canal St., is on the European plan. The Narragansett Hotel, now in process of construction, will be of immense size."], [93, "PROVIDENCE. 75 PROVIDENCE, one of the most beautiful cities in New England, and surpassed only by Boston in wealth and population, is the chief city and one of the capitals of Rhode Island. It is picturesquely situated on the northern arm of Nar ragansett Bay, known as Providence River. The river extends to the centre of the city, where it expands into a beautiful cove nearly a mile in circumference, along which is a wall surmounted by an iron railing. A park planted with elms, and laid out in graveled walls, surrounds the cove. The land on which the city stands is very irregular. On the E. side a hill rises to the height of 204 ft. above tide-water. On the W. it is level, with little elevation for a quarter of a mile, when the land rises to the height of 75 ft. The sides and summits of the hills are covered with dwelling-houses, interspersed with gardens and ornamented with trees. Providence is an ancient town, dating as far back as 1636, when its founder, Roger Williams, banished from Massachusetts on account of his religious opinions, sought here that liberty which was denied to him elsewhere. The rock (\"What Cheer Rock\") on the bank of the Seekonk River on which he landed, and where be was received by the Indians, is about 1 m. from the centre of the city near the E. end of Power St. The town suffered severely in the famous war with King Philip, 1675, when a con siderable portion of it was burned. It wras incorporated in 1832, and in 1875 had a population of 100,675. Nine railroads converge at Providence, which has also a large coasting ami some foreign trade. Its manufactures are very extensive, includ ing \"prints\" (for which it is the leading American market), cotton and woolen goods, iron, gold and silver ware, and numerous other articles. The celebrated Gorkam-plate, the Peabody rifles, and the Corliss engines, are manufactured here; tind the workshops of the American Screw Company (employing 2,500 hands) are the best-appointed of their kind in the country. Seven out of the 9 railroads use the same Railroad Depot, a spacious and elegant brick structure situated near the heart of the city on the S. side of the cove, and fronting on Exchange Place. Horse cars run through different parts of the city, and to the adjoining towns. The main business thoroughfare is Westminster St., and extending from it to Weybosset St. is the Arcade, the finest of the kind in the United States. It is 225 ft. long by 80 wide, a portion in the centre being 50 ft. wider ; it is 3 stories high, has 78 shops, and is devoted chiefly to the retail trade, the principal articles sold being dry-goods, boots and shoes, hats, and jewelry. The building is of granite, with two imposing Doric porticoes, one on each street. In the vicinity is the massive granite building of the Custom-House and Post-Office. The State-House is a small brick building on the E. side of Providence River, at the corner of Main and Court Sts. Near the railroad depot a granite building for the City Hall has recently been com menced, which is estimated to cost $675,000, and which will be one of the finest municipal buildings in New England. A County Court-House is to be erected on the cor. of College and Benefit Sts. The new Opera-House and the Butler Exchange (in Westminster St.) are tine structures; and several of the school-houses are ex ceptionally handsome buildings. Close by the railroad depot in the middle of an open square is the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, erected by the State in memory of its citizens who fell in the civil war. It was designed by Randolph Rogers, cost $60,000, and consists of a base of blue Westerly granite, with five bronze statues. On the monument are inscribed the names of the soldiers it commemorates, 1,741 in number. There are 76 churches in the city, of which the most notable are : the First Baptist, a quaint old edifice, erected in 1774-'75, standing in open grounds on the side of a hill (in N. Main St. near President). It was founded in 1639, and is the oldest Baptist society in America. Grace Church (Episcopal), in AVestminster St., is a handsome stone structure, with an exceedingly graceful spire. St. Stephen's ( Episcopal) is a substantial brown-stone edifice, with stained-glass windows, and richly-decorated interior. The Union Congregational, and the Roman Catholic churches of St. Mary and St. Joseph, are fine buildings. On the heights in the E. section of the city stand the 6 handsome buildings if Brown University, an old and important institution of learning. It was founded in 1764, and was first located at Warren, Rhode Island, but was removed to Providence in 1770. Its library con-"], [94, "76 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. tains over 40,000 volumes, and is remarkably rich in rare and costly works. The Museum of Natural History contains a valuable collection of specimens; and the art-collection embraces some good portraits. The grounds comprise 16 acres, and are beautifully adorned with elms. The Rhode Island Historical Society, founded in 1822, occupies a fine brick and granite building opposite the University grounds. It has a library' of 6,000 volumes and 35,000 pamphlets, besides a large collection of MSS. and other memorials relating to the history of the State. The Athen\u00e6um, cor. College and Benefit Sts., is a substantial granite building, containing a reading-room and a well-selected library of 34,000 volumes ; also some valuable paintings, includ ing portraits by Allston and Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Malbone's masterpiece. The Butler Hospital for the Insane occupies large and imposing buildings on the W. bank of Seekonk River, surrounded by extensive grounds. The Dexter Asylum for the Poor is a fine edifice of brick, situated on elevated land E. of the river in Hope St. The grounds, which comprise about 40 acres, are inclosed by a stone wall 8 ft. high. The Rhode Island Hospital has stately buildings surrounded by pleasant grounds in the S. part of the city, fronting on the harbor. The Reform School occupies the large mansion in the S. E. section of the city, formerly known as the Tockwotton House ; and near by is the Home for Aged Women. The State Prison is a gloomy structure on the N. side of the cove, near the depot. Besides the promenades about the cove, there are several small public squares. Roger Williams Park, containing about 100 acres, is near the W. Shore of Narra gansett Bay, in the S. part of the eity ; it was devised to the city in 1871 by Betsey Williams, a descendant of Roger Williams. Swan Point Cemetery, tastefully laid out and elegantly ornamented, is on the E. bank of the Seekonk River, near the Butler Hospital for the Insane. At Cranston, 4 m. W. of Providence, is the famous Narragansett Trotting Park. A favorite drive is to Hunt's Mill (34 m.), where there is a beautiful brook with a picturesque little cascade. Vue de I'Eau is the name of a spacious summer-hotel, picturesquely perched upon a high terrace 4 m. below the city, overlooking the Bay and the country for many miles around. Pawtuxet, a m. from the city on the W. shore of the Bay, has a fine beach and excellent bathing. Below is Gaspee Point. which was the scene of a noted exploit during the Revolution. Some citizens of Providence, after adroitly beguiling a British sloop-of-war (the Gaspee) upon the treacherous bar, stole down by night in boats and after capturing the crew burned the vessel to the water's edge. Rocky Point, equidistant between Providence and Newport, is an attractive summer retreat, among shady groves and rocky glens, on the W. shore. Here is a good hotel with bathing-houses attached, and a tower, 170 ft. high, affording a charming view of the Bay and the adjacent country. But the place is chiefly famous for its clam-bakes, which are unequaled elsewhere. Marked Rock is another popular excursion-place, a few miles higher up the Bay. In summer-time, steamers leave Providence almost every hour for the various resorts on the Bay (50c. for the round trip), and 4 times daily for Newport. PHILADELPHIA TO PITTSBURG. ( Via Pennsylvania Central E. E. Distance, 355 m. Time, 12-14 hrs. Pare, $10.) This fine line constitutes one of the chief highways of travel and traffic between the Atlantic coast and the Western States. It extends from the city of Philadel phia through the entire length of Pennsylvania to the Ohio River at Pittsburg, where it connects with routes for all parts of the West, Southwest, and Northwest. At various points along the route is some of the most beautiful scenery to be found in America. For the first hundred miles after leaving Philadelphia, the road runs through the rich agricultural counties of Chester, Lancaster, and Dauphin, in which the size and solidity of the houses and barns, and the perfection of the cultivation, more nearly resemble the best farming districts of England than any other portion of the United States. On either hand may be seen an almost constant succession"], [95, "PITTSBDRC. 77 of quaint old bouses, of stone or brick, surrounded by orchards and shade-trees, and standing in the midst of a country singularly park-like in character ; while at brief intervals towns and villages cluster along the line. The first place of importance is Lancaster (70 in.), which was once the principal inland town of Pennsylvania, and the seat of the State government from 1799 to 1812. It is now a prosperous manu facturing city of 20,000 inhabitants, containing many fine buildings, public and pri vate. Harrisburg (107 m.) is the present capital of Pennsylvania, and is beauti fully situated on the E. bank of the Susquehanna River. It dates from 1785, and in 1870 had a population of 24,796. The State-House is a fine old building, situ ated upon ;i commanding eminence N. of the city, and is plainly visible from the cars. A little S. of it stands the State Arsenal. About 5 m. above Harrisburg the railroad crosses the Susquehanna on a splendid bridge 3,670 ft. long; the view from the centre of the bridge is one of the finest on the line. Duncannon (122 m.) is at the entrance to the beautiful Juniata Valley, which is followed for about 100 m. to the b;ise of the Alleghany Mountains. The landscape of the Juniata is in the high est degree picturesque. The mountain background, as we look continually across the river from the cars, is often strikingly bold and majestic. The passage through the Great Tuscarora Mountain, 1 m. W. of Newport (135 m.), is especially fine. Mount Union Station (193 m.) is at the entrance of the gap at Jack's Mountain. 3 m. beyond is the famous Sidling Hill, and still farther W. the Broad Top Moun tain. At Tyrone City (224 m.) the line enters the Tuckahoe Valley, noted for its iron-ore. At Altoona (239 m.), which is a handsome city of 15,000 inhabitants, the ascent of the Alleghanies begins ; and in the course of the next 11 miles some of the finest scenery and the greatest feats of engineering on the entire line are to be seen. Within this distance the road mounts to the tunnel at the summit by so steep ;t grade that while in the ascent double power is required to move the train, the entire 1 1 in. of descent are run without steam, the speed of the train being regulated by the \" brakes.\" At one point there is a curve as short as the letter U, and that, too, where the grade is so steep that in looking across from side to side it seems that, were the tracks laid contiguous to each other, they would form a letter X. The road hugs the sides of the mountains, and from the windows next to the valley the traveler can look down on houses and trees dwyarfed to toys, while men and ani mals appear ike ants from the great elevation. Going west, the left-hand, and coming e >st, the right-hand side of the cars is most favorable for enjoying the scenery. The summit of the mountain is pierced by a tunnel 3,670 ft. long, through which the train passes before commencing to descend the W. slope. Johnstown (277 m.), at the junction of Stony Creek with Conemaugh River, commands some attractive scenery. The Cambria Iron-Works, seen to the r. of the road, are among the most extensive in America. At Blairsvi/le, (301 m.) the road forks and runs by two distinct routes to Allegheny City and Pittsburg. From this point there is nothing calling for especial mention, though the intervening country on either route is most beautiful and picturesque. PITTSBURG. Hotels: Monongahela House ($i a day), cor. Water and Smithfield Sts.; the Union Depot ($3.50 a day), in the railroad depot ; and the St. Charles, cor. 3d Ave. and Wood St. Near the depot are the St. James and Rush Hotels, on the European plan. PITTSBURG, the. second city of Pennsylvania in population and importance, is situated at the confluence of the Alleghany and Monongahela Rivers, which here form the Ohio. The city proper occupies the delta between the two rivers, and in 1870 had a population of 86,076 ; but in 1872 and 1874 enough of the subur ban towns were annexed to raise the population (according to the census of 1870) to 121,79!l. The population in 1875 was estimated by the local authorities at 140,- O00. Pittsburg was laid out in 1765 on the site of the old French Fort du Quesne, famous in colonial annals, anil on its capture by the British the name was changed to Fnrt Pitt, in honor of William Pitt. The city charter was granted in 1816. In"], [96, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 78 1845 a conflagration destroyed the entire business quarter, consuming $5,000,000 worth of property. The city is substantially and compactly built, and contains many fine residences, particularly in the E. section. A large number of the princi pal avenues are graded and paved. Horse-cars run through the principal streets, and to the suburbs. Seven bridges span the Alleghany River and 5 the Mononga- Pittsburg. hela. From its situation, Pittsburg enjoys excellent commercial facilities, and has become the centre of an extensive commerce with the Western States ; while its vicinity to the inexhaustible iron and coal mines of Pennsylvania has raised it to great and merited distinction as a manufacturing centre. The extent of its iron manufactures has given it the appellation of the \" Iron City,\" while the heavy pall of smoke that constantly overhangs it, produced by burning bituminous coal in all the dwelling-houses and manufacturing establishments, has caused it to be styled the \"Smoky City.\" About one-fourth of the pig-iron and blooms of the United States is used by the rolling-mills of Pittsburg, of which there are 16 ; and about 150 minor iron-establishments convert the product of these mills into machinery and implements for agriculture and domestic use. The annual value of the iron manufactures is about $30,000,000. There are 8 steel-works, of which the average annual product is valued at $7,000,000 ; and 5 copper-manufactories with an annual product worth $3,000,000. The glass-manufacturing establishments are nearly 50 in number, producing articles of the annual value of about $11,000,000. Pittsburg is also largely identified with the production of petroleum, and contains numerous refineries. The stranger will have missed the city's most characteristic sights if he fails to visit some of its great manufacturing establishments, particularly those of iron and glass. The American Iron- Works alone employ 2,500 hands and cover 17 acres ; and the Fort Pitt Works are on a gigantic scale. Smithfield St. is the principal business thoroughfare, and trade is very active in Penn and Liberty Sts., and 5th Ave., which contains many handsome retail stores. Among the public buildings are the Municipal Hall, cor. Smithfield and Virgin Sts., costing $750,000, with a granite front and a massive central tower ; the Court- House, a solid stone edifice, cor. 5th Ave. and Grant St., with a columned portico and surmounted by a dome; the Custom-House and Post-Office, a commodious"], [97, "ALLEGHENY CITY. 79 structure of stone, cor. Smithfield St. and 5th Ave. ; and the United States Arsenal, a group of spacious buildings standing in the midst of ornamental grounds in the N. E. section of the city. Of the 150 churches, the most imposing is the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Paul, a large edifice of brick, with 2 spires and a dome over the choir. Trinity Church (Episcopal) is a fine building in the English-Gothic style, in 6th St. near Smithfield St. St. Thomas (Episcopal), in Grant St., is also a handsome structure. The First Presbyterian, near Trinity Church, is a massive stone edifice with two towers. Other notable church edifices are the First Baptist and the Third Presbyterian. The new and elegant building of the Mercantile Library is in Penn St. ; it cost $250,000, and contains 15,000 volumes and a well-supplied reading room. In the same building are the rooms and collections of the Pittsburg Art Association. The Young Men's Christian Association has a good reading-room 'at the cor. of Penn and 6th Sts. There are in the city two theatres, an Opera-House, an Academy of Music, and several public halls. The Western University, founded in 1819, has a handsome building in the S. E. part of the city, near the Monongahela, and in 1874 had 17 instructors and 252 stu dents. It has a library of 2,500 volumes, extensive philosophical and chemical apparatus, and a cabinet containing over 10,000 specimens in geology, mineralogy, conchology, and zoology. The Pittsburg Female College (Methodist) is a flourish ing institution. Several of the public-school buildings are large and substantial. Among the principal charitable institutions are the Western Pennsylvania Hospital, an immense building in Ridge Ave., with a department for the insane at Dixmont, on the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne & Chicago R. R. ; the City General Hospital ; the Hom\u0153opathic Hospital and Dispensary ; the Mercy Hospital, in Stephenson St. ; the Episcopal Church Home ; and the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum. The Con vent of the Sisters of Mercy (Webster Ave. cor. of Chatham) is the oldest house of the order in America. Birmingham is a flourishing suburb, lying across the Monongahela from Pitts burg (reached by bridge or ferry). It has important manufactories of glass and iron, which are worth a visit. Manchester, now a part of Allegheny City, is 2 m. below Pittsburg, on the Ohio. Here is located the House of Refuge, incorporated in 1850; and the Passionist Monastery of St. Paul and the Franciscan Convent are near by. The United States Marine Hospital is a short distance below. East- Liberty, 5 m. from Pittsburg, on the Central R. R., is a thriving suburb, containing some fine residences, and affording a delightful drive to and from the city. ALLEGHENY CITY. Hotel: The Central Allegheny House ($4 a day). ALLEGHENY CITY is situated on the W. bank of the Alleghany River, oppo- site Pittsburg, with which it is connected by 5 bridges. Its manufacturing interests are large, and the elegant residences of many Pittsburg merchants may be seen here, occupying commanding situations. In 1870 the city had a population of 53,180. The City Hall is on the square at the crossing of Ohio and Federal Sts., and the Allegheny Library is close by. The finest church in the city is St. Peter's (Episcopal), which has a bass-relief of the Ascension over the entrance. The Western Penitentiary is an immense stone building, in the ancient Norman style, situated on the \" common.\" It was completed in 1827, at a cost of $183,000. Visitors are ad mitted from 2 to 4J p.m. every day except Saturdays and Sundays. The Western Theological Seminary (Presbyterian) was established herein 1827. It is situated on a lofty, insulated ridge, 100 ft. above the river (reached by Ridge St.), and affords a magnificent prospect. The Theological Seminary of the United Presbyterian Church. established in 1826, and the Allegheny Theological Institute, organized in 1840 by the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, are also located here. The Alle gheny Observatory, situated on an elevated site N. of the city, is a department of the Western University at Pittsburg. The Public Park lies around the centre of the city; it contains 100 acres, and is adorned with several tiny lakelets and a monu-"], [98, "80 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. inent to Humboldt. On a lofty crest near the Alleghany in the E. part of the city stands the Soldiers' Monument, erected to the memory of the 4,000 men of Alleghany Co. who lost their lives in the civil war. It consists of a graceful column, sur rounded at the base with statues of an infantry-man, a cavalry-man, an artillerist, and a sailor, and surmounted by a bronze female figure of colossal size. A fine view is obtained from this point. NEW YORK TO CHICAGO.\u2014 HO UTE I. < Via New York Central & Hudson Elver R. E.. and Great Western and Michigan Central Railways. Distance, 961 m. Time, about 36 hrs. Fare, $22.) \u25a0 From New York City to Albany this route is substantially the same as that described in the trip by steamer up the Hudson River. (See p. 51.) From the cars, however, only the W. bank of the river is visible, and the most attractive portions of the scenery are missed. . The portion of the route between Albany and Rochester has also been described. (See p. 55.) Leaving Rochester, the road runs through a rich agricultural region, passing two or three small but pretty towns, to Lockport (429 m. from New York), a thriving little city of 15,000 inhabitants, famous for its limestone-quarries and its manufacture of flour. Here, the wonderful system of locks by which the Erie Canal descends from the level of Lake Erie to the Genesee level, is visible from the windows of the cars. At Suspension Bridge (448 m.) the train crosses the Niagara River, in full view of the Falls and of the rapids rushing toward the whirlpool below. The bridge itself is worth attention as one of the achievements of modern engineering. It is 800 ft. long from tower to tower, is 258 ft. above the water, and was finished in 1855 at a cost of $500,000. A carriage and foot way is suspended 28 ft. below the railway-tracks. From Suspension Bridge to Detroit, the route runs through Canada, and is most uninteresting. In the neighborhood of St. Catharine's (459 m.) and Hamilton (480 m.) there is some attractive scenery, but with these exceptions everything is dull, flat, and monotonous, and the traveler will be glad when, emerging from a deep cut, he suddenly comes upon the bank of the Detroit River, at Windsor (678 m.), opposite Detroit, Michigan. Here the train is transferred to the other, side of the river on a steam ferry-boat, and the route is resumed on the line of the Michigan Central R. R. Detroit (679 m.) is fully de scribed below. From Detroit to Chicago the road runs through a fine agricultural country, the general aspect of which is pleasing, especially in spring and summer, but which is not of a striking or picturesque character. In many places it passes through dense virgin woods, and in others across and along the winding rivers which abundantly water this section of Michigan. The only towns on the line call ing for special notice are Ann Arbor (715 m.), a very pleasant place, famous as the seat of the University of Michigan, one of the noblest institutions of learning in America ; Jackson (753 m.), a city of about 11,000 inhabitants, containing the State Prison, and numerous manufactories; and Kalamazoo, which has the reputation of being the most beautiful town in the State, which contains several important educa tional institutions, and which is the site of the \" State Asylum for the Insane.\" DETROIT. Hjteli : The three leading hotels are the Russell Hmse, fronting on the Campus Martius, the Biddle House, and the Michigan Exchang\". DETROIT, the chief city of Michigan, is situated on the hanks of the Detroit River, a noble stream or rather strait 20 m. long, connecting Lakes Erie and St. Clair, and affording the best harbor on the entire chain of the Great Lakes. The river varies in width from 4 to 1 m., has a current of from 2 to 3 m. an hour, and is noted for the clearness and purity of its deep, fish-teemins waters. The city extends along the bank for about 7 m., and is built up for about 24; m. from the water. For at least 6 m., the river-front is lined with mills, dry-docks, ship-yards, founderies, grain-elevators, railway-depots, and warehouses. For a short distance from the river-bank the ground rises gradually, and then becomes perfectly level, furnishing"], [99, "DETROIT. 81 an admirable site for a large city. Detroit is laid out upon two plans : the one that of a circle with avenues radiating from the Grand Circus as a centre ; the other that of streets crossing each other at right angles. The result is a slight degree of intri cacy in certain localities, which inconvenience is more than compensated by a nnm- Detroit. her of little triangular parks which diversify and ornament the place. The avenues are from 100 to 200 ft. wide ; the streets vary in width from 50 to 100 ft., and are generally shaded by an abundance of trees. The site of Detroit was visited by the French as early as 1610; but no permanent settlement was made until 1701, when Fort Pontchartrain was built. In 1763 it passed into the hands of the English, and immediately afterward was besieged for 11 months by Pontiac in his attempt to expel the. whites from that region. In 1783 Detroit was ceded to the United States, but the Americans did not take possession of it till 1796. During the war of 1812 it fell into the hands of the British, but was recaptured in 1813. It was incorporated as a city in 1824, when its population was less than 2,000, and in 1870 had 79,577 inhabitants. The manufactures of the city are numerous and important, including extensive iron-works and machine-shops, 3 railroad-car factories, flour-mills, brew eries, and immense tobacco and cigar factories. The shipping interests are also large, while pork and fish packing employ numerous hands. The principal streets of the city are Jefferson Ave., parallel with the river; Wood ward Ave., which crosses the former at right angles, and divides the city into two nearly equal parts; and Fort St., Michigan Ave., Grand River Ave., and Gratiot St., at various angles with Woodward Ave. West Fort St. is a broad and beautiful street, lined with elegant residences; and Lafayette Ave. is a fashionable street. Griswold St. is the Wall St. of the city. The Grand Circus, the principal park, is semicircular in form, and is divided by Woodward Ave. into two quadrants, each containing a fountain. About i m. from the Grand Circus is the Campus Martins, an open space 000 ft. long and 250 ft. wide, which is crossed by Woodward and Michigan Avenues, and from which radiate Monroe Ave. and Fort St. Facing the Campus Martins on the W. is the new City Hall, a handsome structure 200 ft. long, 90 ft. wide, and 180 ft. high to the top of the tower, completed in 1871, at a cost of $600,000. It is built of sandstone in the Italian style, and consists of 3 stories above the basement, with a Mansard roof. In the square in front of the City Hall is a fine"], [100, "82 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. Soldiers' Monument, erected in memory of the Michigan soldiers who fell in the civil war. Facing the Campus Martius on the N. is the Opera-House, one of the largest and most elegant buildings of the kind in the country. The Custom-House, which also contains the Post- Office, is a large stone building in Griswold St. The Board of Trade Building is another fine edifice, but it is unfortunately located in Woodbridge St., near the river, where its fine proportions cannot be seen to advantage. The Freight-Depot of the Michigan Central R. R. is one of the most noteworthy structures in the city. It stands on the wharf, and consists of a single room, 1,250 ft. long and 102 ft. wide, covered by a self-sustaining roof of corrugated iron. In the immediate vicinity are the great Wheat-Elevator of the company, from the cupola of which a superb view of the city, river, and Lakes St. Olair and Erie, may be had; and the Round House, in which 16 locomotives stand under a dome surpassed in size only by that of the Capitol at Washington. Besides the Opera-House, there are the German Stadt- Theater, and several large public halls. The churches of Detroit are noted for their number and beauty. St. Anne's (Ro man Catholic), Earned St. cor. of Bates, is the oldest church in the city, and is noted for its fine choir. The Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul (Roman Catholic), Jefferson Ave. cor. of St. Antoine St., is the largest church-edifice in the State, and has an imposing interior. St. Paul's (Episcopal), cor. Congress and Shelby Sts., is the parent church of the diocese, and is famous for its beautiful roof, which is self-sustaining ; there is not a pillar in the building. Other handsome Episcopal churches are Christ's, in Jefferson Ave. above Hastings St., St. John's, in Woodward Ave., and Grace, in Fort St. The Fort St. Presbyterian (Fort St. cor. 3d) has the handsomest front of any church in the city. The Central Church (Methodist), in Woodward Ave. above the Grand Circus, has a richly-decorated interior. The First Presbyterian, in State St., the Jefferson Ave. Presbyterian, above Rivard St., and the First Congregational, Fort St. cor. Wayne, are all fine edifices. There are several libraries in the city, of which the principal are the Public Library, containing 20,000 volumes, and that of the Young Men's Society, containing 12,000. The Convent of the Sacred Heart, in Jefferson Ave. near St. Antoine St., is a large and very beautiful building. The House of Correction, in the N. portion of the city, is considered one of the best reformatory prisons in the country. Directly opposite is a home for discharged female prison ers, who are received here and furnished with work until places can be found for them out of reach of the evil influences previously surrounding them. The U. S. Marine Hospital, on the bank of the river, just above the city, commands a fine view of the Canada shore. Elmwood Cemetery is a beautiful burying-ground with in the city limits (reached by horse-cars). Woodmere Cemetery, on high ground, 4 m. W. of the city, is of recent origin. Fort Wayne is a bastioned redoubt, about 3 m. below the Michigan Central De pot, standing upon the bank of the river and completely commanding the channel. The Fort St. and Elmwood horse-cars run within half a mile of it, and it is also a favorite point to which rides and drives are taken. Belle He, an island in the river opposite the upper limit of the city, is a favorite resort for picnics. Grosse Point, 7 m. above the city, is a point of land projecting into Lake St. Clair. It is noted for its cherry-orchards, and is the terminus of a beautiful drive over a good road. Grosse He, 18 m. below the city, is an island 3 m. long by 1 m. wide, and is a favor ite resort of the wealthier residents of Detroit, many of whom have beautiful sum mer residences upon it. There is an hotel on the island, and the fishing, boating, and bathing, are excellent. Put-in-Bay Islands, a group of islands in Lake Erie, near the mouth of Detroit River, is a favorite summer resort. From Detroit there is a da;ly steamer in summer to Kelly's Island, the largest of the group. NEW YORK TO CHICAGO.\u2014 ROUTE I J. ( Via Erie'and Lake Shore St, Michigan Southern Bailways. Distance, 958 m. Time about 35 hrs Fare $22.) The Erie Railway, over which this route passes for the first 460 m., is one of the greatest triumphs of engineering skill in this or any other country, and affords some"], [101, "NEW YORK TO CHICAGO. 83 of the grandest and most varied scenery to be found east of the Rocky Mountains. Portions of the line were considered impassable to any other than a winged creature, yet mountains were scaled or pierced, and river-canons passed, by blasting a path from the face of stupendous precipices ; gorges of fearful depth were spanned by bridges swung into the air ; and broad, deep valleys crossed by massive viaducts. For the first 31 m. the road traverses the State of New Jersey, passing through the great manufacturing city of Paterson (17 in.), famed for the beautiful falls of the Passaic. Just this side of Suffern's Station, it crosses the line and enters the State of New York, commencing the ascent of the famous Ramapo Valley. At Sloatsburg (36 m.) the road passes near Greenwood Lake, a noted summer resort, around which are a number of pretty little lakes. Turner's (48 in.) is the most picturesque station on this portion of the line. The view from the hill N. of the station is superb, the Hudson River, with Fishkill and Newburg, being in sight. On approaching Otis ville (76 m.), the eye is attracted by the bold flanks of the ShawTangunk Mountain, the passage of which great barrier (once deemed insurmountable) is a miracle of engineering skill. A mile beyond Otisville, after traversing an ascending grade of 40 ft. to the mile, the road runs through a rock-cutting 50 ft. deep and 2,500 ft. long. This passed, the summit of the ascent is reached, and thence we go down the mountain's side many sloping miles to the valley beneath, through the midst of grand and picturesque scenery. Onward the way increases in interest, until it opens in a glimpse, away over the valley, of the mountain-spur known as the Cuddeback ; and at its base the glittering water is seen, now for the first time, of the Delaware & Hudson Canal. Eight miles beyond Otisville we are imprisoned in a deep cut for nearly a mile, and, on emerging from it, there lies spread before us (on the r.) the rich and lovely valley and waters of the Neversink. Beyond sweeps a chain of blue hills, and at their feet, terraced high, gleam the roofs and spires of the town of Port Jervis (88 m.) ; while to the S. the eye rests upon the waters of the Delaware, along the banks of which the line runs for the next 90 m. At Shohola (107 m.) we find ourselves among some of the greatest engineering successes of the Erie route, and some of its chief pictorial charms. Here the road lies on the mountain-side, several hundred feet above the river, along a mighty gully, supported by grand natural abut ments of jagged rock. Upon 3 m. of this Shohola section, upward of $300,000 were expended. At Deposit (177 m.) the valley of the Delaware is left, and we begin the ascent of the high mountain-ridge wThich separates it from the lovely valley of the Susquehanna. As the train descends into the latter valley, there opens suddenly on the r. a picture of rare and bewitching beauty. This first glimpse of the Susquehanna is esteemed one of the finest points of the varied scenery of the Erie route. A short distance below, we cross the great Starucca Viaduct, 1,200 ft. long and 110 ft. high, constructed at a cost of $320,000. From the vicinity of Susquehanna, the next Sta- tion (193 m.), the viaduct itself makes a most effective feature of the valley views. For a few miles beyond Susquehanna the route still lies amid mountain-ridges, but these are soon left behind, and we enter upon a beautiful hilly and rolling country, thickly dotted with villages and towns. Binghamton (215 m.) is a flourishing city of 13,000 inhabitants, an important railroad centre, and the site of the State Inebri- ate Asylum. Twenty-one miles farther we come to Owego, a large and prosperous manufacturing town, and then to Elmira (274 m.), the most important city on the road, with a population of 15,863. At Hornellsville (332 m.) we reach the last and least interesting division of the road, and soon after begin to descend to the Lake Erie level, passing through a wild and desolate region, with few marks of human habitation. At Salamanca (414 m.) we diverge to the west on the track of the Atlantic & Great Western R. R., passing through Meadville (see p. 98) and the oil- region of Pennsylvania, to Cleveland (627 m.), which will now be described. Tick- ets may be procured via Buffalo and Dunkirk if preferred ; and the view on the Buffalo division at Portage is considered by many the finest on the road. (For continuation of the route beyond Cleveland, see p. 86.)"], [102, "84 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. CLEVELAND. Hotels: The best are the Weddell House, cor. Superior and Bank Sts., and the Kennard House. There are numerous second and third class houses, some of them well kept. CLEVELAND, the second city in size and importance in Ohio, is situated on the S. shore of Lake Erie, at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River. Originally the town was confined to the E. bank of the river, but subsequently Brooklyn, or Ohio City, sprung up on the opposite side, and both parts are now united under one cor poration. The greater portion of the city stands on a gravelly plain, elevated about 100 ft. above the lake. The river passes through it in a winding course, affording an excellent harbor, which has been improved by dredging out a commodious ship channel (branching from the river near its mouth), and by the erection of 2 piers 200 ft. apart, stretching several hundred feet into the lake. On the E. pier is a lighthouse, and another stands on the cliff above. The city is laid out with much taste, chiefly in squares, the streets being remarkably wide and well paved. The abundance of shade-trees, chiefly maple, has given it the title of the \"Forest City.\" The business blocks are mostly of brick and stone, from 3 to 5 stories high, and a large proportion of the dwellings are constructed of the same materials. Several bridges Cleveland, from the Reservoir. cross the Cuyahoga, connecting the different portions of the city, and there are seven lines of horse-cars. The growth of Cleveland has been very rapid. It was laid out in 1796, but in 1830 contained only 1,000 inhabitants. It received its first impetus from the completion in 1834 of the Ohio Canal, which connects Lake Erie at this point with the Ohio River at Portsmouth. A further stimulus was given after 1850 by the development of the railroad system, and since 1860 its prosperity has been greatly increased by the rapid extension of manufacturing industry. In 1870 the population was 92,829, but it is now estimated at more than 160,000. The com merce of the city is very large, especially with Canada and the mining regions of Lake Superior. The most important manufactures are of iron and coal-oil; in the production of refined petroleum Cleveland is second only to Pittsburg. Other im portant products are sulphuric acid, wooden-ware, agricultural implements, marble"], [103, "CLEVELAND. 85 and stone, railroad-cars, and white-lead. Pork-packing is also carried on to some extent. The main business thoroughfare ot the city is Superior St., on which are the larger retail stores, banks, and hotels. Other important business streets are River. Merwin, Water, and Ontario Sts. Euclid Ave. is lined with elegant residences, each surrounded by ample grounds, and is considered the handsomest street in the coui. try. Prospect St., parallel to the avenue, ranks next in beauty. The square known as Monumental Park, which occupies 10 acres near the centre of the city, was formerly open to foot-passengers only, but since 1866 it has been divided into four smaller squares by the extension of Superior St. from E. to W., and of Ontario St. from N. to S. The square is shaded with fine trees, and is admirably kept. In the centre stands a statue of Commodore Perry, the hero of the battle of Lake Erie, erected in 1860 at a cost of $8,000. The pedestal is of Rhode Island granite, 12 ft. high ; the statue itself is of Italian marble and is 8 ft. 2 in. high. In front of the pedestal is a marble medallion representing the passage of Perry in a small boat from the Law rence to the Niagara during the heat of the battle. In the N. W. corner of the park there is a handsome fountain ; and in the S. W. a pool and cascade. W. of the river is another park, called the Circle, which has a fountain in the centre, and is finely adorned with shade-trees. The United States building fronting on the park, containing the Custom-House. Post-Office, and Federal courts, is a fine stone structure, as are also the City-Hall and the County Court-House which also front on the park. Case Hall, a beautiful edifice near the park, contains, besides the rooms of the Cleveland Library Association, and numerous offices and stores, a fine hall capable of seating 1,500 persons and used for lectures, concerts, etc. The principal place for dramatic entertainments is the Cleveland Opera House, a new and very ele gant building, besides which there are a Bohemian theatre, a German theatre, a Theatre Comique, and several public halls for lectures, etc. The Union Railway Depot, built in 1866, is a massive stone structure, one of the largest of its kind in the world. On the keystone over the main entrance is a bass-relief portrait of Mr. Amasa Stone, under whose supervision the depot was built. There are similar portraits of Grant and Lincoln, and various symbolical designs upon keystones at either end 'of the building. The Water- Works stand near the lake, W. of the river. By means of a tunnel extending 6,600 ft. under the lake, pure water is obtained, which is forced by two powerful engines into a large reservoir, occupying the highest point W. of the river, whence it is distributed through the city. The Reservoir is a popular resort, and affords a broad and beautiful view over the city, lake, and surrounding country. Of the 88 churches in the city, the Methodist Church, cor. Erie St. and Euclid Ave., is the finest. It is of stone, with a lofty spire, and has an elegant chapel in the rear. The Roman Catholic Cathedral is a large and handsome building in the Gothic style; and Trinity Church (Episcopal) is an imposing edifice, also in the Gothic style. The First, Second, and Third Presbyterian churches are all fine structures. Among the educational institutions, the Cleveland Medical College, founded in 1843, is the most important. It occupies an imposing struct ure on the corner of Erie and St. Clair Sts. The Cleveland Female Seminary, in Woodland Ave., is a fine building; and the two High-School buildings are handsome edifices of brick and stone. The Cleveland Library Association has a library and reading-room in Case Hall. The library contains about 15.000 volumes, selected with special reference to the wants of students and persons of culture. The Public Library, opened in 1869, contains about 10,000 volumes. It is free, and is supported by an annual tax upon the citizens of one-tenth of a mill, which produced in 1870 a revenue of $4,000. On the shore of the lake, near the Medical College, stands the extensive build ing of the IT. S. Marine Hospital. The Charity Hospital, in Perry St., was estab lished partly by the city and partly by private subscriptions, and is attended by the Sisters of Charity. The Hom\u0153opathic Hospital, on University Heights, has a large building. Connected with it is a Hom\u0153opathic College, which is a flourishing in stitution, admitting female students. The House of Correction, on the E. outskirts 7"], [104, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 86 of the city, is a large and handsome structure, for the confinement and utilizing of city offenders. The City Infirmary, to which the sick aud homeless poor are takenj has attached to it a good farm, which is worked by the inmates of the insti tution. . . Cleveland has three beautiful cemeteries. City Cemetery, in Erie St.^ is laid out with rectangular walks shaded with trees, and contains many fine monuments. Woodlawn Cemetery, more recently opened, is on the E. boundary of the city. It is prettily laid out with paths winding amid the native trees and abundant shrubbery, and is rich in monuments and statuary. Lake View Cemetery, containing 300 acres, is in Euclid Ave., about 5 m. from the city. It is 250 ft. above the level of the lake, commands extensive views, and, though only opened in 1870, has already been greatly beautified and adorned. Resuming the route westward to Chicago, at the distance of 31 m. from Cleve land we come to Oberlin, noted as the seat of Oberlin College, from which no per son is excluded on account either of sex or color. This college, sounded in 1834, combines manual labor with study, inculcates entire social equality between whites and blacks, and has had a prosperous career. Toledo (715 m. from New York) is an important point, and within a few years has developed from an inconsiderable vil lage into a large and rapidly-growing city. In 1850 the population was 3,820 ; in 1870 it was 31,693, and is now estimated' at 50,000. It is situated on the Maumee River, 4 m. from a broad and beautiful bay, and 12 m. from Lake Erie, of which it is regarded as one of the ports. Its commerce is very large, consisting chiefly of the handling of grain ; and its manufactures are numerous and important, includ ing car-factories, iron-works, locomotive-shops, furniture-factories, flour-mills, and breweries. The best hotels are the Boody House, Oliver House, and American ; and the handsomest buildings in the city are the churches and schoolhouses. At To ledo the road branches, one division running through Southern Michigan and known as the Michigan Southern Division, the other running through Indiana, and known as the Air-Line. The former is the one usually followed by the through-trains, and the same rich agricultural country is traversed by both. Adrian (747 m.) is the largest city in Southern Michigan, and is a handsomely-built town. Its popula tion in 1870 was 8,453. At Elkhart, Ind. (857 m.), the two divisions of the road unite again ; and the route from there to Chicago is through a flat prairie-country which has been well described as having \" a face but no features.\" The principal stations on this portion of the line are Mishawaka (837 m.), South Bend (868 m.), and La Porte (899 m.), all in Indiana. Chicago is described on p. 89. NEW YORK TO CHICAGO.\u2014 li OUTE III. (Via \" Pan-Handle Route,\" which includes the Pennsvlvania R. R., and the Pittsburc, Cincinnati & St. Louis R. R.

That portion lying between Philadelphia and Pittsburg is also described on p. 76. At Pittsburg (445 m. from New York) the train takes the track of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis R. R., which crosses four States and traverses the rich agricultural regions of the Great West. Steubenville (488 m.) is picturesquely situated upon an elevated plain on the W. bank of the Ohio River. It is the centre of an extensive trade, and is the seat of an academy for boys and of a noted female seminary. Newark (605 m.) is situated at the junction of the three forks of Licking River, and is a handsome town, the streets being wide and abundantly shaded, and the stores, churches, and dwellings, well built. The next important station is Columbus (638 m.), which will now be described. (For the continuation of the route beyond Columbus, see p. 88.)"], [105, "COLUMBUS. 87 COLUMBUS. Hotels: Neil House, cor. High and Capitol Sts. ($3 a day); American House, cor. \"High and State Sts. ($2.50 a day); United States Hotel, cor. High arid Town Sts. <1$2 a day). COLUMBUS, the capital of Ohio, and one of the largest cities in the State, is situated on the E. bank of the Scioto River, 100 m. N. E. of Cincinnati. It was laid out in 1812, became the seat of the State government in 1816, and was incorporated as a city in 1834, when its population was less than 4,000. The popu- lation in 1870 was 31,274, and is now estimated at nearly 50,000. The commercial .interests of the city are large, and its manufactures numerous and important; but its growth and wealth are chiefly due to the concentration there of the State insti- tutions, and the liberal expenditure of public money. The streets are very wide and are regularly laid out in squares. Broadway is 120 ft. wide for a distance of more than 2 miles. It has a double avenue (4 rows) of trees, alternate maple and elm, and is one of the most beautiful streets in the country. The finest resi- liences in the city are on this and Town St. The principal business thoroughfare is High St., which is 100 ft. wide, and paved with the Nicholson pavement. Horse- \u2022cars reach all parts of the city (fare 5c), and there are 6 bridges across the Scioto. In the centre of the city, occupying the square of 10 acres between High and Third and Broad and State Sts., is Capitol Square, surrounded by majestic elms and beauti- fully laid out. It is proposed to make it a complete arboretum of Ohio trees, of which many varieties are already represented. The most interesting feature of Columbus to the stranger is its public buildings and institutions, in which it is not excelled by any city in the United States except Washington, and much surpasses any other town in the Ohio Valley. The State has concentrated here nearly all the public buildings devoted to its business, benev- olence, or justice. The Capitol, which stands in Capitol Square, is one of the largest .and finest in the United States. It is constructed of fine gray limestone, resem- bling marble, in the Doric style of architecture, of which it is a noble specimen. It is 304 ft. long and 184 ft. wide, and is surmounted by a dome 64 ft. in diameter and 157 ft. high. The interior is elegantly finished. The hall of the House of Rep- resentatives is 84 ft. long by 724; ft. wide, and the Senate-Chamber is 56 by 72-J ft. There are also rooms for all the State officers, besides 26 committee-rooms. Another very striking building is the State Penitentiary. It is of hewn limestone, in the cas- tellated style, and with its yards and shops covers 6 acres of ground on the E. bank of the Scioto, just below the mouth of the Olentangy. The Central Ohio Lunatic Asylum was burned down in 1868, but a new series of buildings is now being \u2022erected for it on 300 acres of elevated ground W. of the city. These buildings will be in the Franco-Italian style, with a frontage of about 1,200 ft., a depth of 300 ft., a central tower 165 ft. high, and a capacity for 600 patients. The Idiot Asylum, a plain Gothic structure, 272 by 198 ft., occupies grounds 123 acres in extent adjoin- ing those of the Lunatic Asylum. The new Blind Asylum, in the E. part of the city, on the grounds of the old one, will be a stone structure, 340 by 270 ft., in the Gothic style of the Tudor period. The Deaf and Dnmb Asylum, centrally located in extensive and handsome grounds in Town St., cor. Washington Av., is built in the Franco-Italian style, with Mansard roof. The building is 400 ft. long and 380 deep, and has numerous towers, the central one of which is 140 ft. high. The U. S. Arsenal is located in the midst of spacious and handsome grounds, beautifully wooded, in the N. E. suburb of the city. It comprises, besides an immense central structure, nu- merous other buildings, used for offices, quarters, storehouses, etc. There is a fine , <lrive to the Arsenal, and beautiful drives are laid out through and around the \u25a0grounds. The State has also a large and well-built Arsenal. The City Hall, facing 'Capitol Square on the S. side of State St., is a handsome Gothic structure, 187i ft. by 80, with a small central tower 138 ft. high. In the third story is the large au- dience-chamber, capable of seating 2,830 persons. The High-School (in Town St.) is a fine building in the simple Norman or church style of architecture. The Holly Water - Works occupy a large building near the junction of the Scioto and Olentangy"], [106, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 88 Rivers. The machinery is on a massive scale. The Odd-Fellows' Hall, in High St.. near Capitol Square, is a fine specimen of classic Italian, and opposite is Opera- House Block, a beautiful specimen of American street, architecture, in the florid Ital ian style. The Opera-House in this block is one of the most elegant in the country. There are 44 churches in the city, and some are fine examples of the decorative period of Gothic architecture, Most notable among them are Trinity Church (Episcopal), cor. Broad and 3d Sts. ; St. Joseph's Cathedral (Roman Catholic), cor. Broad and 5th Sts. ; the Second Presbyterian, cor. 3d and Chapel Sts. ; and St. Paul'.* (Episcopal), cor. High and Mound Sts. The latter is surmounted by a graceful. spire 2J6 ft. high, and in the* tower is a clock. The State Library, in the Capitol, contains over 36,000 volumes. Starling Medical College, cor. State and 6th Sts., is it, very noble building in the Norman castellated style. It is of brick trimmed with whitish limestone. Capital University (Lutheran) is an unpretentions building in> the Italian style, surrounded by beautiful grounds, in the N. part of the city. The handsome building of the female seminary of St. Mary's of the Springs adjoins the city on the E., and near by is the Water-Cure. The Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College, endowed with the congressional land-grant, was opened in 1873. Of the charitable institutions, the Hare Orphans' Home, the Hannah Neis Mission, and the Lying-in Hospital may be mentioned. The Catholic Asylum for the reclamation of fallen women is W. of the city, and the Sisters of Mercy have a tine hospital in the city. The County Infirmary or Poor-House is a fine struct ure on a large farm near the city. A convent of the Sisters of the Gcod Shepherd has been established at Franklin, a suburban town. t^, Goodale Park, presented to the city by Dr. Lincoln Goodale, is at tne N. end of the city, and comprises about 40 acres of native forest, beautifully improved and we] J kept. City Park, at the S. end of the city, is about the same size as Goodale Park and resembles it in all respects. The grounds of the Franklin County Agricultural1 Society, 83 acres in extent, on the E. border of the city, are the finest in the State. In the immediate vicinity are the gardens of the Columbus Horticultural Society. occupying 10 acres. Olentangy Park, N. of the city, has a half-mile\". race-course. Of the five cemeteries in Columbus, Green Lawn is the most beautiful. After leaving Columbus many small towns are passed, but none are of any im portance until we reach Piqua (711 m. from New York), which is noted for its charming situation on the W. bank of the Great Miami River, just at a bend which leaves a level plateau between the town and the water's edge, while on the oppo site side the bank rises somewhat boldly. The Miami Canal passes through the town, and an active business is carried on. Union City (742 m.) is the point where the route enters the State of Indiana. Logansport, hid. (833 m.), is an important shipping-point for grain, pork, and lumber, and is the centre of trade for a rich agricultural region. Here are located the extensive car-works of the company, em ploying 600 workmen, and capable of turning out 3 cars a day. Chicago (949 m.) is. described on p. 89. \"NEW YORKXTO CHICAGO.\u2014 ROUTE IV.', Via \" Allertowu Line.\"?.'

R. Easton i* one of the most flourishing towns in Pennsylvania, is one of the great railroad cen tres of the country, and contains extensive iron-works, mills, distilleries, etc. In the centre of the town is an abrupt peak, called Mount Jefferson ; and to the E., on Mount Lafayette., is Lafayette College, a richly-endowed institution with a large"], [107, "NEW YORK TO CHICAGO. 89 library and a fine mineral cabinet. Allentown (102 m.) is a beautiful city of 14,000 inhabitants, situated upon elevated ground between Jordan Creek and the Lehjgh River. It has large iron and other manufactories. The country along this portion \u25a0of the road is exceedingly fertile and picturesque. Reading (138 m.) is the third \u25a0city of Pennsylvania in manufactures and the fourth in population. It was founded in 1748 by William and Richard Penn. The plain on which the city is built rises gradually from the Schuylkill River, and is inclosed on the E. by Penn's Mount, which is several hundred feet high, and forms a part of the South Mountains. The Court-House and several of the churches are fine buildings, and there are immense furnaces, rolling-mills, railroad-shops, etc. At Harrisburg (192 m.) the cars take \u25a0the track of the Pennsylvania Central E. R., which they follow to Pittsburg, pass in j: over the most attractive portions of the Central road, including the Susquehanna Valley, the crossing of the Alleghanies, the superb mountain-views near Altoona, the valley of the Juniata, and other points of interest (described on p. 76). At Pittsburg (431 m.) we leave the Pennsylvania Central for the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne & Chicago R. R., though through-passengers need not change cars if they have taken the precaution to seat themselves in one of the New York & Chicago through-cars. This road passes through some of the richest portions of Ohio and' Indiana, but, as the country is level and for the most part unbroken, it presents no features of a strictly picturesque character. Salem (501 m.) is a pretty town, and \u2022one of the most important in the E. section of Ohio. Canton (533 m.) is beautifully situated on the banks of the Nisuishillen Creek, surrounded by a rich farming country, which enjoys the distinction of sending more wheat to market than any other county in the State. Massillon (541 m.) and Mansfield (607 m.) are good :specimens of the handsome, compactly-built, and busy towns, with which the State is dotted. Fort Wayne (751 m.) is known as \"Summit City,\" from the fact that it is the point from which the water runs E. and W. It is one of the most important towns in Indiana, is handsomely laid out, and is at the junction of 4 railroads. The Wabash &, Erie Canal passes through the place. Warsaw (791 m.), Plymouth (815 m.), and Valparaiso (855 m.) are thriving towns. Chicago (899 m.) will now be described CHICAGO Y_NjlI iUAGO, the principal city of Illinois, has within 40 years grown iroin a small V_y Indian trading-station to the position of the metropolis of the Northwest, and fbe greatest railway centre on the continent. It is situated on the W. shore of Lake Michigan, at the mouth of the Chicago River, in lat. about 41\u00b0 50' N., and Ion. 10* 33' W. from Washington. The site of the business portion is 14 ft. above the lake ; it was originally much lower, but has been filled up from 3 to 9 ft. since 1856. It \"is an inclined plane, rising toward the W. to the height of 28 ft., giving slow but suffi- cient drainage. The city stands on the dividing ridge between the basins of the Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and is surrounded by a prairie stretching several hun- dred miles S., W., and N. One-eighth of a mile N. of the Court-House a bayou, \u2022railed the Chicago River, extends westward a little more than half a mile, and then \u2022divides into the North and South branches, which run nearly parallel with the lake- shore, about 2 m. in each direction. The river and its branches, with numerous -lips, afford a water frontage of 38 m., of which 24 m. are improved, without includ- ing the lake-front, on which an outer harbor is now in process of construction. Con- nected with the S. branch is the terminus of the Illinois & Michigan Canal, whicl \u2022 extends to the Illinois River at La Salle. Formerly this connection was by means us ;i lock; but recent improvements have effected a continuous flow of water from the lake through the river into the canal. The city extends N. and S. along the lake about ft m., and W. from the the lake about 5 m., embracing an area of nearly 35 sq. in. The river divides the city into three distinct parts, known as the North, South, *ind West Divisions, which are connected by 33 bridges and 2 stone tunnels under '.the river-bed. The city is regularly laid out, with streets generally 80 ft. wide, and many of them from 3 to 7 m. in length, crossing each other at right angles. The principal thoroughfares run N. and S"], [108, "90 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. The first white visitors to the site of Chicago were Joliet and Marquette, who\u00bb arrived in August, 1673. The first permanent settlement was made in 1804, during which year Fort Dearborn was built by the United States Government. The fort stood near the head of Michigan Ave., below its intersection with Lake St. It was Chicago before the Fire. abandoned in 1812, rebuilt in 1816, and finally demolished in 1856. At the close of 1830, Chicago contained 12 houses and 3 \" country \" residences in Madison St., with a population (composed of whites, half-breeds, and blacks) of about 100. The town was organized in 1833, and incorporated as a city in 1837. The first frame building was erected in 1832, and the first brick house in 1833. The first vessel entered the harbor June 11, 1834; and at the first official census taken July 1, 1837, the entire population was found to be 4,170. In 1850, the population had increased to 29,963; in 1860, to 112,172; and in 1870, to 298,977. Local estimates placed the population in 1875 at 400,000. In October, 1871, Chicago was the scene of one of the most destructive conflagrations of modern times. The fire originated on Sun day evening, October 8th, in a small barn in De Koven St\u201e in the S. part of the West Division, from the upsetting, as is supposed, of a lighted kerosene-lamp. The buildings in that quarter were mostly of wood, and there were several lum ber-yards along the margin of the river. Through these the flames swept with. resistless fury, and were carried across the South branch by the strong westerly wind then prevailing, and thence spread into the South Division, which was closely built up with stores, warehouses, and public buildings of stone, brick, and iron,, many of them supposed to be fire-proof. The fire raged all day Monday, and crossed the main channel of the Chicago River, sweeping all before it in the North ern District, which was occupied mostly by dwelling-houses. The last house was not reached till Tuesday morning, and many of the ruins were still burning several months afterward. The total area burned over, including streets, was nearly 3\u00a3 sq. m. The number of buildings destroyed was 17,450 ; persons rendered homeless, 98,500; persons killed, about 200. Not including depreciation of real estate, or loss of business, it is estimated that the total loss occasioned by the fire was $190,000,000,, of which about $44,000,000 was recovered on insurance, though one of the first. results of the fire was to bankrupt many of the insurance companies all over she country. The business of the city was interrupted but a short time, however. Be-"], [109, "CHICAGO. 91 I fore winter many of the merchants were doing business in extemporized wooden structures, ami the rest in private dwellings. In a year after the fire, a large part of the burnt district had been rebuilt, and at present there is scarcely a trace of the terrible disaster save in the improved character of the new buildings over those de- The Burned District. stroyed. On July 14, 1874, still another great fire swept over the devoted city, de stroying 18 blocks, or 60 acres in the heart of the city, and about $4,000,000 worth of property. Over 600 houses were consumed, but fortunately by far the larger number of these were the wooden shanties of the poorer classes. All the magnifi cent structures of the rebuilt section escaped. Chicago ranks next in commercial importance to New York among the citie> of the United States. As early as 1854 it had become the greatest primary depot for grain in the world ; and since then it has also become the greatest grain-market in the world. Of breadstuff's, 88,426,842 bushels were received and shipped in 1872 ; wheat, Indian-corn, and oats, being the principal items. Chicago is also the most important market for live-stock in the United States. The total value of the live stock received in 1872 was estimated by the Board of Trade at $75,450,000. During the season of 1872-'73, 1,456,650 hogs were packed, and 16,080 cattle. The lumber trade is a very important item of the city's commerce. Over one billion feet of lumber were received during 1873. The manufactures of Chicago are yet in their infancy, but they are already extensive and important, employing about 50,000 per sons, and including iron and steel works, flour-mills, cotton-factories, boot and shoe factories, and tanneries. It is estimated that nearly one-third of the commerce of the city is based upon its manufacturing products. Hotels, Restaurants, and Clubs.\u2014 Most of the old and well-known hotels of Chicago perished in the great fire, but those which have taken their places are probably unequaled in the world. The Palmer House is an immense fire-proof structure of iron and brick, occupying the entire block in State St., between Wabash Aye. and Monroe St. The building is one of the most imposing in the city, and its interior decorations are very fine ($3.50 to $6 a day). The Grand. Pacific Hotel is in no re spect inferior to the preceding. It occupies the entire block bounded by Jackson, Clark, Quiney, and La Salle Sts., is of stone, six stories high, and is richly deco rated and sumptuously furnished ($3.50 to $7 a day). The Sherman House, cor."], [110, "HAND-BOOK 01-' AMERICAN CITIES. 92 Randolph and Clark Sts., is near the business centre of the city ($3.50 and $4 a day ). The Tremont House, cor. Lake and Dearborn Sts., is one of the finest of the new build ings ($3.50 to $5 a day). Good hotels on a more modest scale are : the Central Hotel, in Market St., near Madison ($2.50 a day) ; the Metropolitan, cor. State and Wash ington Sts. ($2.50 a day) ; the Massasoit House, opposite the Union Depot ($2 a day) ; t te Atlaiitic, cor. Van Buren and Sherman Sts. ($2.50 a day) ; and the Commercial, cor. Lake and Dearborn Sts. There are also several good hotels on the European plan, prominent among which are Burke's and Euhn's. The principal restaurants are the Palmer House (in connection with the hotel), cor. State and Monroe Sts. ; the Tremont House (in connection with the hotel), cor. Ltike and Dearborn Sts. ; Thos. Andrews, 85 Dearborn St. ; Burke's, 140 and 142 Madison St. ; and Thomson's, 81 Clark St. The livoli Garden, described further on, is frequented by both sexes. Most of the club-houses were destroyed in the great fire, and the clubs tempo rarily broken up. There are several active social organizations in the city, however, the privileges of which may be obtained on introduction by a member. Railroad Depots. \u2014 The Union Depot, in Van Buren St. at the head of La Salle, is one of the largest and finest in the country. It is of stone, and is used by the Chi cago, Rock Island & Pacific R. R., and by the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. R. The Central Depot is another handsome and spacious stone structure, situ ated at the foot of Lake St. ; it is used by the Illinois Central, the Michigan Central, and the Burlington & Quincy Railroads. The Wells Street Depot, cor. N. Wells and Kinzie Sts., is used by the Western Division of the Chicago & Northwestern R. R. ; the Kinzie Street Depot, cor. Canal and W. Kinzie Sts., is used by the Northern Division of the same road. Modes of Conveyance. \u2014 Horse-cars traverse the city in all directions, affording cheap and easy communication (fare 5c). The great centre of the horse-car routes is at the cor. of State and Randolph Sts. Parmelee's omnibuses are in waiting at the depots, and convey passengers to hotels or to other depots (fare 50c). There are also lines of omnibuses running S. on Wabash Ave., W. on Washington and Adams Sts., and N. to Lincoln Park (fare 10c). Carriages are in waiting at the depots and steamboat-landings, as well as at hotels, and around Court-House Square. The rates of fare are regulated bylaw, and are as follows: For 1 passenger from one depot to another, 50c ; for 1 passenger 1 m. or less, 50c ; over 1 m. and less than 2 m. $1; over 2 m., $1.50; each additional passenger, 50c; children between 5 and 14 years of age, half- rates. By the hour, $2 for the first hour and $1 for each additional hour. Between midnight and 7 a. m. each trip (without regard to dis tance or number of passengers), $2; In case of disagreement call for a policeman or drive to a police-station. Streets and Drives. \u2014 State St. is the Broadway of Chicago, and on it or near it are the finest commercial structures, hotels, retail stores, and the like. Other important. business streets are Lake, Clark, La Salle, Randolph, Dearborn, Adams, Monroe, Madison, and Washington. In fact, there is scarcely a street in the South or busi ness district which does not contain some notably fine buildings. The finest resi dences are in Wabash and Michigan Avenues, which are of a semi-suburban charac ter, adorned with rows of luxuriant trees, and bordered by villas surrounded with beautifully ornamented grounds. Scarcely inferior are Prairie Ave., South Park Ave., West Washington St., and North Dearborn St. The favorite drives are out Wabash and Michigan Avenues ; through the parks and boulevards, especially to Hyde Park, where there is bathing ; to Riverside, a pretty suburban town on the W. side (13 m.) ; and to Lake View, on the N. side, beyond Lincoln Park. Public and Promiuent Buildings. \u2014 The Court-House, Custom-IIouse and Post-Office, Chamber of Commerce, and most of the other public buildings of the city, were burned down in the great fire, and have not been replaced as rapidly as the busi ness structures destroyed at the same time. A new Custom-IIouse and Post- Office is being erected on a site a little S. of the old one. It will be one of the finest public buildings in the country, occupying an entire block, and costing upward of $3,500,000. A new Court-House, estimated to cost $2,000,000, is going up in"], [111, "CHICAGO. 93 Court-House Square. The Chamber of Commerce has been rebuilt on the old site in Washington St., opposite Court-House Square, and is one of the finest and most complete buildings of the kind in the world. Its interior decorations are very elaborate. The Board of Trade meets here, and strangers will find it interesting to visit the ladies' gallery during the daily session (from 11 a. m. to 1 p. m.) ; or any gentleman is admitted to the floor on introduction by a member. The new hotels, already mentioned, are among the finest buildings in the city; as are also the Cen tral Depot, at the foot of Lake St., and the Union Depot, in Van Buren St. at the head of La Salle. The new and handsome brown-stone building of the Chicago Tribune, cor. Dearborn and Madison Sts., is worthy of notice. Other representa tive structures are Greenbaum's Bank Building, in 5th Ave., the Chicago Savings Institution, cor. Madison and Dearborn Sts., and Hole's Block, 200 to 206 Ran dolph St. Theatres and Places of Amusement. \u2014 The far-famed Crosby's Opera-House was burned down in the fire of 1871, and has not been rebuilt, though a new one is in con templation. MeVicker's Theatre, near the cor. of State and Madison Sts., is one of the finest in the country. Hooley's, just W. of the Sherman House, is also a beauti ful theatre. The Academy of Music, in Halstead St. near Madison, was built in 8 weeks after the fire, and has since been enlarged and improved. Aiken's Theatre, cor. Wabash Ave. and Congress St., and Myer's Opera-House (minstrels), in Monroe St. near State, are new. The Globe Theatre, in Desplaines St. near Madison, is devoted to legitimate drama, and has a good company. The Dexter Park race course, is located near the Union Stock -Yards. The Shooting-Club has a park close by, and in the season keeps about 25,000 pigeons in cages and houses for practice and matches. Churches.\u2014 There are about 180 church edifices in Chicago, including those un touched by the fire and those which have since been rebuilt. Among the most notable are: Unity Church (Unitarian) in N. Dearborn St. cor. Lafayette Place, a white-marble structure, in the modern Gothic style, with double spires. The Second Presbyterian, cor. Michigan Ave. and 18th, St., is a large and imposing stone structure. The Michigan Avenue Baptist Church, in Michigan Avenue near 24th St.. is of stone, in the Gothic style, with a graceful tower and spire. St. James's (Episcopal), cor. Cass and Huron Sts., is large and massive, with a square flanking tower. The Union Park Congregational, cor. Ashland Ave. and Washington St., has a lofty spire and is quite ornate in style. The Second Baptist, cor. Monroe and Morgan Sts., is a plain edifice in the Italian style, with a most peculiar spire. The Twelfth Street Church (Roman Catholic) is pure Gothic in style and has an ex tremely rich and noble interior. Libraries, Educational and Charitable Institutions, etc.\u2014 The old Custom-IIouse build ing, cor. Dearborn and Monroe Sts., has been sold to the city and fitted up as a Public Library, the nucleus of which was contributed by English authors and pub lishers in 1872. The collection now comprises about 8,000 volumes. The Christian Union has a library, reading-room, gymnasium, etc. The Academy of Sciences, established in 1857, lost a valuable collection of 38,000 specimens in the fire, but has erected a new building on the old site (in Wabash Ave. near Van Buren St.), and is slowly gathering a new museum and library. The Tniversity of Chicago, founded by the late Stephen A. Douglas, occupies a beautiful site, overlooking Lake Michi gan, at Cottage Grove, 4 m. S. of Court-House Square (reached by State St. cars). The main building, 136 by 172 ft., was completed in 1866, at a cost of $110,000. The S. wing has recently been added. When finished the edifice will be one of the most commodious and elegant in the West. Dearborn Observatory, adjoining the University on the W., contains a Clark refracting telescope, which is one of the largest and best in the world. It has 23 ft. focal length and 18V inches aperture. The Baptist Theological Seminary has a large and handsome building in rear of the University. The Chicago Theological Seminary has a fine stone building in the Norman style on the W. side of Union Square, at the intersection of Reuben and Warren Sts. The Presbyterian Theological Seminary has a fine edifice, recently erected at the cor. of Fullerton Ave. and Halstead St. It is 5 stories high, and con-"], [112, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 94 tains a good library. The St. Ignatius College (Roman Catholic) has an elegant building, No. 413 W. 12th St. There are 6 medical colleges in the city, of which the most noteworthy is the Rush Medical College, founded in 1842, and with a new and stately building at the cor. of N. Dearborn and Indiana Sts. The Chicago Medical College has a large structure at the cor. of Prairie Ave. and 26th St. The Hahnemann College (Hom\u0153opathic) is at the cor. of Cottage Grove Ave. and 28th St. The Cook County Hospital, erected in 1856, is a spacious structure at the cor. of 18th and Arnold Sts. Mercy Hospital is an immense building at the cor. of Calu met Ave. and 28th St., well worth visiting (take Indiana Ave. cars). Other im portant charitable institutions are the Magdalen Asylum, in N. Market St. ; the Home for the Friendless, No. 911 Wabash Ave. ; the Protestant Orphan Asylum, cor. Michigan Ave. and 22d St. ; and St. Joseph's (male) and St. Mary's (female) Orphan, Asylums, in N. State St. cor. Superior St. The two last named are under the charge of the Sisters of Mercy. A new Marine Hospital, one of the largest and most costly in the country, is located at Lake View, a little beyond Lincoln Park. Parks, Bonlcvards, and Cemeteries. \u2014 Chicago has a magnificent system of public parks, authorized in 1869, and partially improved previous to the fire, since which the work has proceeded more slowly. There are six parks, aggregating nearly 1,900 acres, which are connected by a cordon of boulevards 250 ft. wide, extending around the three land-sides of the city, with a drive on the lake-shore. These give 33 m. of drives, besides those around the parks. Lincoln Park, on the lake-shore, in the Northern Division, contains about 230 acres, and has 5 m. of drives and walks. fine trees, artificial hills and mounds, miniature lakes and streams, summer-houses, rustic bridges, and shady rambles. Open-air concerts are given here on Saturday afternoons in summer. From the N. end of Lincoln Park a boulevard, 3J m. long, extends W. to Humboldt Park, which contains 193-J acres, and is only partially im proved. About 2 m. S. of Humboldt Park, with which it is connected by a similar boulevard, is Central Park, an irregular tract of land nearly a mile long from N. to S., and containing 171 acres, the middle line of which lies on Madison St., 4 m. from the Court-House. From this park the Douglas Boulevard runs 14. m. S. E. to Douglas Park, which also contains 171 acres. From this another boulevard runs S. 4J m., thence E. 4J m. to the two South Parks, containing 1,055 acres, which are tastefully laid out. The most southerly extends upward of 14; m. along the shore of the Lake. Two boulevards run thence to the well-paved streets that con nect with the business portion of the city. Union Park (reached by Madison and Randolph St. cars or by Washington St. stages) is located in the very centre of the residence portion of the West Division. Though containing only 17 acres, the judi cious expenditure of $100,000 on lakelets, drives, hills, pagodas, zoological gardens, and admirable landscape-gardening, has rendered its apparent size nmch greater. There are open-air concerts here every Wednesday evening in summer. Lake Park, on the S. side, running about 1 m. on the lake-shore, though unimproved itself, is ornamented by the elegant Michigan Ave. residences, and is a favorite promenade on summer evenings. Jefferson Park, one of the smaller public squares, contains a handsome fountain. Of the cemeteries, Graceland, Rose-Hill, and Calvary, in the North Division, are the most interesting. The last two are on the line of the Chicago & Milwaukee R. R. Oakwood, on the Vincennes road, 3 m. S. of the city limits, is a pretty rural spot. This cemetery can be reached by horse-cars and dummy, or by a pleasant drive through the boulevards. Water-Works and Tunnels. \u2014 The system by which Chicago is supplied with water has been called one of the wonders of the world. The Water - Works are situated on the lake- shore in the North Division (take N. Clark St. cars and get off at Chi cago Ave)., and may be inspected on application to the engineer in charge. They comprise a stone water-tower, 130 ft. high, up which the water is forced by 4 engines, having a pumping capacity of 72,000,000 gallons daily, and flows thence through pipes to every part of the city. A very fine view of the city, lake, and surrounding country, may be obtained from the top of the tower, which is reached"], [113, "CHICAGO. 95 by a spiral staircase. From this tower a nearly cylindrical brick tnnnel, 62 inch es high and 60 wide, extends 2 m. under the lake, lying 66 to 70 ft. below the lake-surface. The water enters the tunnel through a grated cylinder, inclosed in an immense crib, on which a lighthouse and signal-station are to be constructed. The tunnel was begun in 1864 and finished in 1866, at a cost of $315,139. Another tun nel, 7 ft. in diameter, was commenced in 1873, which will connect with the cribT and, through independent pumping-works, supply the S. W. section of the city. Another abundant source of water-supply has been recently developed in the Arte sian Wells, of which there are about 40. The first two sunk are situated at the intersection of Chicago and Western Avenues (reached by W. Randolph St. cars), are respectively 911 and 694 ft. deep, and flow about 1,200,000 gallons daily. It is noteworthy that they were sunk in 1864, under the direction of a medium who prophesied that oil would be found there \u2014 and prophesied falsely. The stock-yards, the west-side parks, and numerous manufacturing establishments, are supplied from artesian wells. Until recently intercourse between the three divisions of the city was effected only by 33 bridges, which span the river at intervals of two squares, and swing on central pivots to admit the passage of vessels. These bridges, however, are a seri ous impediment to navigation, as well as to vehicles and pedestrians ; and, in order to obviate the inconvenience, and secure uninterrupted communication between! the South and West Divisions, a Tunnel was constructed in 1868 under the South Branch at Washington St. It is 1,608 ft. long, with a descent of 26 ft., has a double roadway for vehicles and a separate passage for pedestrians, and cost $400,000. In 1870 another similar tunnel, with a total length of 1,890 ft., including approaches, was constructed under the main river on the line of La Salle St., connecting the North and South Divisions (cost $549,000). It is now contemplated to substitute tunnels for bridges at many other points along the river. Miscellaneous Places of Interest. \u2014 No visitor to Chicago should fail to inspect the Union Stock- Yards, where the vast live-stock trade of the city is transacted (reached by State St. cars, or by trains every few minutes). The yards comprise 345 acres, of which 100 are in pens, and have 31 m. of drainage, 7 m. of streets and alleys, 2,300> gates, and cost $1,675,000. They have capacity for 21,000 cattle, 75,000 hogsr 22.0110 sheep, and 200 horses. There is a large and handsome brick hotel connected with the yards ; also a Bank and a Board of Trade. Quite a large town (4,000 in habitants) has sprung up in the immediate vicinity, with post-office, telegraph-office, churches, schools, etc. The scene is very animated and interesting during the day. The Grain-Elevators are also a very interesting feature, and should be visited, m order to obtain an idea of the manner in which the immense grain-trade of Chicago is carried on. There are 15 of these buildings, all situated on the banks of the river, and connected with the railroads by side-tracks. They have an aggregate storage capacity of 12,800,000 bushels, and receive and discharge grain with almost incredi ble dispatch. Pork-pacMng is a highly-interesting process. The hogs are driven: up an inclined plane to a pen in the upper part of the packing-house. A chain or cord attached to a pulley in a sliding frame near the ceiling is slipped over one leg, the hog is jerked up, his throat cut, the body lowered into a long vat of boiling water, lifted out, scraped, disemboweled, and hung up to cool. When cooled, thee bodies are cut up into \" meats,\" salted, and packed. The largest houses are in the vicinity of the Stock-Yards, and are usually open to the inspection of visitors. The Tirnli Garden (in the Exchange Building, cor. Washington and Clark Sts.) is one of the city sights. It is a compound of restaurant, beer-garden, and concert-saloon, aud is richly furnished and decorated. The Exposition Building is a spacious and elegant structure of iron and glass, in Lake Park, at the foot of Adams St. An exhibition of art and industrial products is held here every summer. The Dougla\u00bb Monument occupies a site formerly owned by Senator Douglas himself, and since purchased from Mrs. Douglas for $30,000. The monument consists of a circular base, 52 ft. in diameter, a pedestal 21 ft., and a column 43 ft. high, surmounted by a sphere, upon which a bronze statue of Douglas, 12 ft. high, is to be placed. The en tire height of the monument, when completed, will be 100 ft., and the cost $75,000."], [114, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 96 CHICAGO TO MILWAUKEE. < Via Chicago & Northwestern R. R. Distance, 85 m. Time, 2)<f-3 brs.) This road runs along the W. shore of Lake Michigan through a rich farming re gion, well cultivated and populous. The only important town on the route is Racine (62 m.), which is the second city of Wisconsin in population and commerce. It is pleasantly situated at the mouth of Root River, on the shore of Lake Michigan, on a plain about 40 ft. above the water, and has one of the best harbors on the lake. The city is handsomely laid out in wide and well-paved streets, on which are numer ous fine public buildings, large warehouses, manufactories, and stores. Racine Col lege (Episcopal) is one of the most prominent educational institutions in the West. Racine was settled in 1835, was incorporated as a city in 1848, and in 1870 had a population of 13,282. MILWAUKEE. Hutels: The Newhall House ($4 a day), the largest in the Northwest outside of Chic isjo ; the Plankinton House, an old and favorite resort ; the Walker House, and J.he Junean House, both in Water St., convenient to the business portion of the \u2022city. MILWAUKEE, the commercial capital of Wisconsin, and, next to Chicago, the largest city in the Northwest, is situated on the W. shore of Lake Michigan, at the mouth of Milwaukee River. This river Hows through the city, and with the Menomonee, with which it forms a junction, divides it into three nearly equal dis tricts, which are severally known as the East, West, and South Divisions. The river has been rendered navigable to the heart of the city by vessels of any tonnage used \u2022on the lakes, and is regarded as the best harbor on the S. or W. shore of Lake Michigan. The climate of Milwaukee is peculiarly bracing and healthful, and the atmosphere remarkably clear and pure. The city embraces an area of 17 sq. m., and is regularly laid out. The centre, near the Milwaukee and Menomonee Rivers, is the business quarter ; and the E. and W. parts, the former of which is built npon a high bluff overlooking the lake, while the latter is still more elevated, are occupied by residences. The peculiar cream-color of the \" Milwaukee brick,\" of which many of the buildings are constructed, gives the city a unique and pretty appearance, and has earned for it the name of the \" Cream City of the Lakes.\" The .-streets, except those in the commercial quarter, are generally well shaded. Mil waukee was settled in 1835, and incorporated as a city in 1846. Its population in 1840 was 1,712; in 1860, 45,246; in 1870, 71,440; and in 1874 the local authori ties estimated it at from 95,000 to 100,000. The Germans constitute nearly one half the entire population, and their influence upon the social life of the inhabit ants is everywhere seen. Breweries and lager-bier saloons, gardens, gasthausen, snusic-halls, and restaurants abound ; and on the street one hears German spoken quite as often as English. The commerce of Milwaukee is very large, wheat and flour being the most. important items. In 1873 there were shipped from this port 24,994,266 bushels \u2022;if wheat and 1,805,200 barrels of flour. The storage accommodations for grain comprise six elevators, with a combined capacity of 3,450,000 bushels; and the flour-mills are on an immense scale. Butter, wool, bides, and lumber, are also important articles of trade. The manufactures are extensive, and embrace lager bier (which is highly esteemed and widely exported;, pig-iron and iron castings, leather, machinery, agricultural implements, ste-vm-boilers, car-wheels, furniture, and tobacco and cigars. The product of the blast-furnaces and rolling-mills for 1873 was valued at about $3,500,000; of the flouring-mills. $5,000,000; of the breweries, $2,600,000; of the distilleries, $1,500,000; and of the tanneries, $3,000, \u25a0000. East Water St. and Spring St. are very wide and handsome thoroughfares, and on them are the principal hotels and retail stores. Among the public buildings, the finest is the United States ( nstom-H jusp, which also contains the Post-Office and the"], [115, "MILWAUKEE. 97 U. S. Courts. It is of Athens stone, and stands on the cor. of Wisconsin and Mil waukee Sts. The new Connty Court-House is a handsome edifice. The Music Half has an elegant auditorium, with sittings for 2,300 persons. It was erected in 1864, at a cost of $65,000, and is owned by the German Musical Society. The Opera- House and the Academy of Music are fine buildings, the latter being used for theat rical performances, and having 800 sittings. There are several banking-houses. Milwaukee. which have large and imposing buildings. The most prominent church edifice in. the city is the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. John. The new Baptist Church is also a handsome structure. Of the literary institutions the most prominent is the Mil waukee Female College, which, in 1873, had 6 instructors and 118 students. The Young Men's Association has a library of 11,000 volumes, and a well-supplied read ing-room. The Northwestern National Asylum (for disabled soldiers) is an immense brick building, about 3 m. from the city, having accommodations for 700 or 800 in mates. The institution has a reading-room, and a library of 2,500 volumes. The grounds embrace 425 acres, more than half of which is under cultivation, the residue being laid out as a park. In the city there are three orphan asylums, a Home for the Friendless, and two hospitals. Several of the industrial establishments are well worth a visit, especially the Grain-Elevator of the Milwaukee & St. Paul R. R. This immense structure has a storage capacity of 1,500,000 bushels, and is one of the largest on the continent. The flour-mill of Betschey & Kern has a capacity for pro ducing 1,000 barrels of flour daily ; and the rolling-mill of E. B. Ward is one of the most extensive in the West. NEW YORK TO CINCINNATI.\u2014 R O U TE I. {Via Erie H. R. and Atlantic & Great Western R. R. Distance 6(11 m. .Time, about HO hrs. Fare, J2d.) As tar as Salamanca, New York (413 m.), this is identical with Route II. from New York to Chicago. (See page 82.) At Salamanca the train takes the line of the Atlantic & Great Western road, crossing the N. W. corner of Pennsylvania and passing through the heart of the oil-region. Freehold (465 m.) is the first station in Pennsylvania. Corry (474 m.) came into existence as the result of the discovery of oil, the first building ever erected there being a small eating-house, in August. 1861."], [116, "98 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. It promises to become an important manufacturing town and railroad centre. Meadville (516 m.) is one of the oldest towns W. of the Alleghanies, and is now the centre of a large trade with the oil-region. It is the seat of Alleghany College, founded in 1816, and of the Western Theological Seminary (Unitarian), founded in 1844. Among the more prominent edifices are a State arsenal, an academy, and several \u25a0churches. Orangeville (555 m.) is the first station in Ohio. Akron, O. (616 m.), is an attractive and prosperous place, lying in the midst of a fine agricultural region, at the junction of the Ohio & Pennsylvania with the Ohio & Erie Canal. Mansfield (682 m.) lias already been mentioned. (See p. 89.) Urbana (766 m.) is a charming village, in which some manufacturing is done, and which contains several churches, banks, and a Swedenborgian College. Springfield (780 m.), one of the most beautiful cities in the State, is situated at the confluence of the Lagonda Creek and Mad River, both of which furnish excellent water-power, which is utilized in numerous manufactures. Many of the stores and residences are elegant, and there are also several handsome churches. Dayton (801 m.) is on the E. bank of the Great Miami River, at the mouth of Mad River, and, with its broad and beautifully-shaded streets, elegant private residences, and fine public buildings, is one of the handsomest cities in the country. The Court-House is particularly noticeable as one of the finest in the West. The most attractive feature of Dayton to the tourist is the Central National Soldiers' Home, situated on a picturesque elevation, 4 m. from the city, and reached by horse-cars. The Home is an extensive group of fine, large buildings, over 40 in number, including a handsome church, built of native white limestone, and a splen- did hospital, said to be the best adapted to its purpose of any in the United States. The latter is of red brick, with freestone facings and trimmings, and accommodates 300 patients. The principal other buildings are a brick dining-hall, capable of seat- ing 3,000 persons, a fine library, a music-hall, billiard-room, bowling-alley, head- quarters building, and several barracks for the men. The grounds embrace an area of 640 acres, well shaded with natural forest-trees, and are handsomely laid out, with winding avenues, a deer-park, stocked from Lookout Mountain, a beautiful artificial lake, a natural grotto, hot-houses, and flower-beds. Hamilton (836 m.) is a pretty town, situated on both sides of the Miami River. Cincinnati (861 m.) is described on p. 101. NEW YORK TO CINCINNATI.\u2014 R O UTE II.

At Columbus the train takes the line of the Little Miami R. R., extending S. W. through a rich and populous prairie country, dotted with towns and villages. London (663 m.) is a pretty town, capital of Mad ison County, and containing a fine union schoolhouse. Xenia (693 m.) is, like a large proportion of Ohio towns, regularly and handsomely built, the streets being shaded with large forest-trees. The surrounding country is undulating, fertile, and highly cultivated. Milford (744 m.) is a flourishing village on the opposite bank of the Little Miami River. It is connected with the R.

Fare, 416., The grandeur of the scenery along the line of the Baltimore & Ohio R. R. makes it one of the most attractive routes that tourists can take, and it possesses the addi tional interest of having been the theatre of some of the most exciting scenes in the late civil war, during which it suffered severely by the destruction of its track, bridges, and rolling-stock. Baltimore, the principal city of Maryland, has already been described. (See p. 36.) In leaving Baltimore by this road the train no sooner emerges from the dingy suburbs than the pleasures of the trip commence. Looking back we obtain a fine view of the city, and then cross Carrollton Viaduct, a fine"], [117, "NEW YORK TO CINCINNATI\u2014 BALTIMORE TO CINCINNATI. 99 bridge of dressed granite, with an arch of 80 ft. span, over Gwinn's Falls, after which the road soon enters the long and deep excavation under the Washington turnpike. Less than a mile farther the \"deep cut\" is encountered, famous for its difficulties in the early history of the road. It is 76 ft. deep and nearly 4. m. long. Beyond this the road crosses the deep ravine of Robert's Run, and, skirting the ore banks of the old Baltimore Iron Company, now covered by a dense forest of cedar trees, comes to the long and deep embankment over the valley of Gadsby's Run, and the heavy cut through Vinegar- Hill immediately following it. At the Relay Sta tion (9 m.) the open country of sand and clay ends, and the region of rock begins at the entrance to the gorge of the Patapsco River. In entering this defile there is a fine view of the Thomas Viaduct, a noble granite structure of 8 elliptic arches, spanning the stream at a height of 66 ft. above the bed, and nearly 700 ft. long. Ellicott' s Mills (14 m.) is in a bold, rocky passage of the Patapsco, which runs leap ing and dashing through the village, in full view from the car-window. Near\u00c6Y^s ville (20 m.) the road twice crosses the river, the first time by a viaduct 330 ft. long, and the second time by one of nearly 300 ft. From the summit of the ridge at Mount Airy (42 m.) is a noble view westward across the Fredericktown Valley, and as far as the Catoctin Mountains, 15 m. distant. The road thence descends into the valley of Bush Creek, a stream of moderate curves and gentle slopes, except where it breaks through ranges of trap-rock. Frederick Junction (58 m.), better known as Monocacy, is near the battle-ground where, on the 9th of July, 1864, the Federals were defeated by a superior Confederate force. From this point to the Point of Rocks, the road, having escaped from the narrow, winding valleys to which it has thus far been confined, bounds away over the beautiful champaign country \u2022extending to the Catoctin Mountains, a continuation of the Blue Ridge. Point of Rocks (69 m.) takes its name from a hold promontory, which is formed by the pro file of the Catoctin Mountain, against the base of which the Potomac River runs on the Maryland side, the mountain towering up on the opposite (Virginia) shore, form ing the other barrier to the pass. The railroad passes the Point by a tunnel, 1,500 ft. long, cut through the solid rock. Beyond, the ground becomes comparatively smooth, and the railroad, leaving the immediate margin of the river to the canal, runs along the base of gently-sloping hills, passing the villages of Berlin and Knox ville, and reaching the Weverton Factories, in the pass to the South Mountain. From South Mountain to Harper's Ferry the road lies along the foot of a precipice for the greater part of the distance of 3m., the last of which is immediately under the rocky cliffs of Elk Mountain, forming the N. side of this noted pass. The Shenandoah River enters the Potomac just below the bridge over the latter, and their united currents rush rapidly over the broad ledges of rock which stretch across their bed. The length of the bridge, over river and canal, is about 900 ft., and at its W. end it bifurcates, the left-hand branch connecting with the Winchester & Potomac R. R., which passes directly up the Shenandoah, and the right-hand carry ing the main road, by a strong curve in that direction, up the Potomac. Harper's Ferry (81 m.) is delightfully situated in Jefferson Co., W. Virginia, at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, the town itself being compactly but irregu larly built around the base of a hill. ' Before the civil war it was the seat of an ex tensive and important United States armory and arsenal ; but these were destroyed during the war, and have not been rebuilt. The scenery around Harper's Ferry is wonderfully picturesque. Thomas Jefferson pronounced the passage of the Potomac through the Bine Ridge \"one of the most stupendous scenes in Nature, and well worth a voyage across the Atlantic to witness.\" The tourist should stop here for at least one day, and climb either Maryland Heights (across the Potomac) or Bolivar Heights (above the town). A short distance above Harper's Ferry the road leaves the Potomac and passes up the ravine of Elk Branch, which, at first narrow and serpentine, widens gradually until it almost loses itself in the rolling table-land which characterizes the \" Valley of Virginia.\" The head of Elk Branch is reached in about 9 m., and thence the line descends gradually over an undulating country to the crossing of Opequan Creek. Beyond the crossing, the road enters the open valley of Tuscarora Creek, which it"], [118, "100 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. crosses twice and follows to the town of Martinsburg (100 m.), where the railroad company have built extensive shops. Seven miles beyond Martinsburg the road crosses North Mountain by a long excavation, and enters a poor and thinly-settled district covered chiefly with a forest in which stunted pine prevails. The Potomac Harper's Ferry. is again reached at a point opposite the ruins of Fort Frederick, on the Maryland side. Sir John's Run (128 m.) is the point of departure for Berkeley Springs (2J2 m. distant), and just beyond the station the track sweeps around the Cacapon Mountain, opposite the remarkable insulated hill called \"Round Top.\" The next point of interest is the Doe Gully Tunnel (1,200 ft. long). The approaches are very imposing, as for several miles above and below the tunnel they cause the road to occupy a high level on the slopes of the river-hills, and thus afford extensive views of the grand mountain scenery around. The Paw-Paw Tunnel is next reached, and, after passing through some 20 m. of rugged and impressive scenery, we cross the N. branch of the Potomac by a viaduct 700 ft. long and enter Maryland. Cumberland (178 m.) is in the mountain-region of the narrow strip which forms the W. part of Maryland, and in point of population and commerce is its second city. The en trance to the town is beautiful, and displays the noble amphitheatre in which it lies to great advantage, the gap of Will's Mountain, W. of the town, being a promi nent feature of the view. From Cumberland to Piedmont (28 m.) the scenery is remarkably picturesque. For the first 22 m., to the mouth of New Creek, the Knobly Mountain bounds the valleys of the N. branch of the Potomac on the left, and Will's and Dan's Mountains on the r. ; thence to Piedmont, the river lies in the gap which it has cut through the latter mountain. The crossing of the Potomac from Maryland to Virginia is 21 m. from Cumberland, and the view from the bridge, both up and down the river, is very fine. At Piedmont (206 m.) the ascent of the Alleghanies is commenced, and Altamont (223) is upon the extreme summit of the range. From Altamont westward for nearly 20 m. are beautiful natural meadows (known as the \" Glades \") lying along the upper waters of the Youghiogheny River, and its numerous tributaries, divided by ridges of moderate elevation and gentle slope, with fine ranges of mountains in the background. The descent of 11 m. to Cheat River presents a succession of very heavy excavations, embankments, and tunnels, and at the foot the famous Cheat River Valley is crossed, with fine views on either side. For several miles on this part of the line the road rut's along the"], [119, "CINCINNATI. 101 steep mountain-side, presenting a succession of magnificent landscapes. Descending from Cassidy's Ridge, which forms the W. boundary of Cheat River Valley, the train soon reaches the great Eingwood Tunnel, which is 4,100 ft. long and cost $1,000,000; and, 2 m. beyond, Murray's Tunnel, 250 ft. long. Grafton (279 m.) is the end of the mountain division of the road, and from this point to the Ohio River it passes through a country which is well wooded, and rich in coal and petroleum, but without interest for the tourist. At Parkersburg (383 m.) the train crosses the Ohio River on a splendid bridge, li m. long, with 6 spans over the river and 43 approaching spans, completed in 1871, at a cost of over $1,000,000. Athens (429 m.) is pleasantly situated on the Hocking River. The Ohio University, the oldest in the State (founded in 1804), is located here; also one of the State Lunatic Asylums. Chillicothe (490 m.) is picturesquely situated on a plateau through which flows the Scioto River. It was founded in 1794, and from 1800 to 1810 was the capital of the State. It is now a handsome and thriving town. Cincinnati (589 m.) is described below. CINCINNATI. CINCINNATI, the chief city of Ohio, is situated on the N. bank of the Ohio River, in lat. 39\u00b0 6' N. and Ion. 84\u00b0 27' W. It has a frontage of 10 m. on the river, and extends back about 3 m., occupying half of a valley bisected by the river, on the opposite side of which are the cities of Covington and Newport, Ky. It is surrounded by hills from 400 to 465 ft. in height, forming one of the most beautiful amphitheatres on the continent, from whose hilltops may be seen the splendid panorama of the cities below, and the winding Ohio. No other large city in the United States affords such a variety of position and scenery. Cincinnati is princi. pally built upon two terraces, the first 60 and the second 112 ft. above the river- The latter has been graded to an easy slope, terminating at the base of the hills. Cincinnati, O. The streets are laid out with great regularity, crossing each other at right angles, are broad and well paved, and for the most part beautifully shaded. The business portion of the city is compactly built, a fine drab freestone being the material chiefly used. The outer highland belt of the city is beautified by elegant residences 8"], [120, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 102 which stand in the midst of extensive and highly-adorned grounds. Here the favorite building material is blue limestone. Cincinnati was settled in 1788, but for a number of years a continual series of difficulties with the Indians retarded the progress of the town. In 1800 it had grown to 750 inhabitants, and in 1814 it was incorporated as a city. About 1830 the Miami Canal was built, and during the next 10 years the population increased 85 per cent. In 1840 the Little Miami, the first of the many railroads now centring at Cincinnati, was finished, and in 1850 the population had increased to 115,436. In 1860 it was 161,044, and in 1870, 216,239. The central position of Cincinnati in relation to extensive producing regions and to leading channels of commerce has rendered it one of the most important commercial centres of the West ; hut manu factures constitute its chief interest. In 1875 there were 4,469 manufacturing establishments whose products were valued at $144,000,000. Iron, furniture, boots and shoes, beer and whiskey, machinery, and steamboats, are leading items in the product ; but pork-packing is the principal industry.

They occupy the large section of the city N. of the Miami Canal, which they have named \" the Rhine.\" The visitor finds himself in an entirely different country \" over the Rhine,\" for he hears no language bnt German, and all the signs and placards are in German. The business, dwellings, theatres, halls, churches, and especially the beer-gardens, all remind the European tourist of Germany. Strangers should visit the Great Arbeiter and Turner Halls, in Walnut St., Wielert's saloon and garden, in Vine St., and some one of the vast beer-cellars, which can be found almost anywhere \" over the Rhine.\" The Suspension- Bridge over the Ohio, connecting the city with Covington, Ky., is the pride of Cin cinnati.

CINCINNATI TO LOUISVILLE. The journey from Cincinnati to Louisville may be made via the Louisville & Cincinnati Short-Line R. R. (110 m. long), which runs through a fertile and pleas- antly-undulating country, but offers no strikingly picturesque or noteworthy features. By far the pleasantest way, however, in summer, is to take a steamer down the Ohio, of which there are two or three daily. The distance is 132 m., and while the scenery is not so impressive as that on the upper portions of the river, it is both varied and attractive. The view from the steamer on leaving Cincinnati is remark- ably fine. On the one hand is the densely-populated city, its rows of massive build- ings rising tier above tier toward the hill-tops, which, crowned with villas and vine- yards, form a semicircular background. On the opposite bank rise the beautiful Kentucky hills, their summits still crowned by the earthworks raised during the days of Cincinnati's threatened danger in the civil war; while at their feet nestle the twin cities of Covington and Newport. There are few towns of importance on the Ohio between Cincinnati and Louisville, and they are separated by long stretches of virgin woodland and plain. North Bend (17 m.) was the residence of William Henry Harrison, President of the United States, and his tomb, a modest brick"], [125, "LOUISVILLE. 107 structure upon a beautiful knoll, is visible for several miles, both up and down the river. The Great Miami River (21 m.) is the boundary between Ohio and Indiana. Lawrenceburg (23 m.) and Aurora (27 m.) are flourishing towns in Indiana, which do a large shipping business. Big-Bone Lick (46 m.) is in Boone County, Ky., and derives its name from the fact that bones of the mastodon and the arctic elephant were formerly found scattered all over the surface of the ground in the neighbor hood. Carrollton (75 m.) stands at the mouth of the Kentucky River, a navigable stream about 200 in. long, noted for its wild and picturesque scenery. Madison (87 m.) is one of the principal cities in Indiana, is beautifully situated and well built, and makes a handsome show from the river. The approach to Louisville is fine, affording a really imposing view of the city, and of Jeffersonville on the opposite bank. The river is here about 1 in. wide, and is crossed by one of the finest bridges in the United States, giving unbroken connection between the railway systems of the Northern and Southern States. LOUISVILLE.' LOUISVILLE, the chief city of Kentucky, and one of the most important in the country, is situated at the Falls of the Ohio, where Bear-Grass Creek enters that river. Its site is one of peculiar excellence. The hills which line the river through the greater part of its course recede just above the city, and do not ap proach it again for more than 20 m., leaving an almost level plain about 6 m. wide, and elevated about 70 ft. above low-water mark. The Falls, which are quite pict uresque, may be seen from the town. In high stages of the water they disappear almost entirely, and steamboats pass over them ; but when the water is low, the whole width of the river has the appearance of a great many broken cascades of foam, making their way over the rapids. To obviate the obstruction to navigation caused by the falls, a canal, 2J m. long, has been cut around them, to a place called Shippingport. It was a work of vast labor, being for the greater part of its course cut through the solid rock, and cost nearly $1,000,000. The city extends about 3 m. along the river and about 4 m. inland, embracing an area of 13 sq. m. It is regu larly laid out, with wide, well-paved streets, and large squares, which are bisected each way by paved alleys, 20 ft. wide. The beauty of the residences is a notable feature of the city ; most of them are set back from the street, leaving lawns in front, which are planted with flowers and shrubbery, and the streets are lined with shade trees. The business portion is compactly built, and contains many fine edifices. Main, Market, Jefferson, and Green, are the principal streets in this section. The first settlement of Louisville was made by 13 families, who accompanied Colonel George Rogers Clarke on his expedition down the Ohio in 1778. The situa tion was so exposed to Indian attacks that the settlers first established themselves on Corn Island, an island at the head of the falls, near the Kentucky shore, which has since disappeared. On the reception of the news of the capture of Vincennes by Colonel Clarke's forces, the colony removed to the mainland and built a station. The town was established in 1780, and called Louisville, in honor of Louis XVI. of France, whose troops were then aiding the Americans in their struggle for inde pendence. It was incorporated as a city in 1828, when its population was about 10,000. In 1850 the population bad increased to 43,194; in 1860 to 68,033 ; and in 1870 to 100,753. The trade of Louisville is immense, amounting in 1875 to upward of $250,000,000. It is one of the largest leaf-tobacco markets in the world, the sales of this one article amounting to over $5,000,000 annually. The trade in pro visions aggregates from $11,000,000 to $15,000,000 annually ; and the city is rapidly becoming one of the most important markets for live-stock in the country. Pork packing is extensively carried on, and the sugar-curing of hams is a special feature of the business. The annual product of iron foots up $5,000,000. Louisville is the great distributing market for the fine whiskeys made by the Kentucky distilleries. The manufacture of beer has also become a very important interest. Leather, ce ment, agricultural implements, furniture, and iron pipes for water and gas mains, are the other leading manufactures."], [126, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 108 Hotels. \u2014 The Gait House ($4.50 a day), a massive stone structure in the English style, has long been celebrated as one of the best hotels in the United States.

The road along the Viaduct-Bridge at Louisville. borders of Bear Grass Creek, in the direction of Lexington, is especially attractive. The fine forest vegetation, the park-like groves, the hemp-fields, and the blue-grass pastures, all help to beguile the eye in the Louisville drives and rambles. Jefferson ville, a flourishing town on the Indiana shore, opposite Louisville, and connected"], [128, "110 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. with it by ferry and bridge, is situated on an elevation from which a fine view of Louisville may be obtained. The bridge across the Ohio at this point is 5,219 ft. long, divided into 25 spans, supported by 24 stone piers, and cost $2,016,819. New Albany, opposite the W. end of Louisville, is a finely-situated and handsomely-built city of nearly 25,000 inhabitants, with wide and delightfully-shaded streets, fine churches and public buildings, and elegant private residences. \" From the hills back of New Albany,\" says Mr. Edward King, \"one may look down on the huge extent of Louisville, half-hidden beneath the foliage which surrounds so many of its houses ; can note the steamers slowly winding about the bends in the Ohio, or carefully working their way up to the broad levees ; can see the trains crawling like serpents over the high suspended bridge, and the church spires and towers gleam ingTunder the mellow sunlight.\" CHICAGO TO ST. LOUIS. ' {(Via Chicago & Alton S..R. Distance, 282 m.|. Time, 11 hrs.) Feom Chicago (described on p. 89) this road runs S. W. through the rich prairie lands of Central Illinois, which roll off in gentle undulations as far as the eye can reach on either hand. The villages along the line are prosperous little places, but possess no general interest. The scenery is monotonous, and, since the country has become thickly settled, has lost the distinctive prairie character which is now only seen to perfection in the W. part of Iowa, and on the plains beyond the Missouri. Joliet (37 m.) is a prosperous and handsomely-built town on the Des Moines River, the site of the State Penitentiary, which is one of the finest in the United States, and of extensive quarries of a gray limestone, much used for building-purposes throughout the Northwest. Bloomington (126 m.) is one of the principal cities of the State, an important railway centre, and the seat of large shipping and manu facturing interests. The city contains about 15,000 inhabitants, and some fine churches, public buildings, etc. Springfield (185 m.), the capital of the State, is a large and handsome city on the edge of a beautiful prairie. It is regularly laid out, the streets are broad, and the houses well built. The new State Capitol, which occupies a square near the centre of the city, is considered a model of aichitectural beauty ; and the Custom-House, Court-House, and State Arsenal, are fine buildings. In Ridge Cemetery, 2 m. N. of the city, stands the noble monument erected by the Lincoln Monument Association to the memory of President Lincoln. Alton (257 m.) stands upon a high limestone-bluff, overlooking the Mississippi River. It is a flourishing city of 10,000 inhabitants, and contains, among other handsome build ings, a large Roman Catholic cathedral. East St. Louis (281 m.) is on the river opposite St. Louis, and in entering the city the train crosses the magnificent bridge, which will be described farther on, and passes through a tunnel 4,194 ft. long. -iST.

LOUIS is situated geographically almost in the centre of the great valley of the Mississippi, or basin of the continent, on the W. bank of the Mississippi Riv er, 20 m. below the entrance of the Missouri, about 175 m. above the mouth of the Ohio, and 1,170 m. above New Orleans, in lat. 38\u00b0 37' N. and Ion. 90\u00b0 15' W. The city is perched high above the surface of the river. It is built on three terraces,"], [129, "ST. LOUIS. 111 the first rising gently from the river-bank for about 1 m. to 17th St., where the ele vation is 150 ft. above the stream. The ground then gently declines, rises in a sec ond terrace to 25th St., again falls, and subsequently rises in a third terrace to a height of 200 ft. at Cdte Brillante or Wilson's Hill, 4 m. W. of the river. The sur face here spreads out into a broad and beautiful plain. The corporate limits ex tend 11 m. along the river and about 3 m. back from it, embracing an area of nearly 21 sq. m. The densely-built portion is comprised in a district of about 6 m. along the river and 2 m. in width. The city is, for the most part, regularly laid out, the streets near the river running parallel with its curve, while farther back they are generally at right angles with those running W. from the river-bank. It is remark ably well built, stone and brick being the chief materials used, and the architecture being more substantial than showy. In 1762 a grant was made by the Governor-General of Louisiana, then a French province, to Pierre Liguest Laclede and his partners, comprising the \" Louisiana Fur Company,\" to establish trading-posts on the Mississippi ; and on February 15, 1764, the principal one was established where the city now stands, and named St. Louis. In 1803 all the territory then known as Louisiana was ceded to the United States. In 1812 that portion lying N. of the 33d degree of latitude was organized as Missouri Territory. In 1822 St. Louis was incorporated as a city. The first census was taken in 1764, and the population was then 120. In 1811 it was only 1,400 ; in 1850 it had increased to 74,439 ; in 1860 to 160,773 ; and in 1870 to 310, 864. In 1875 the local authorities estimated it at 490,000, which would make St. Louis the third city in the United States in population. As the natural commercial entrepot of the vast Mississippi Valley, the commerce of St. Louis is immense ; the chief articles of receipt and shipment being breadstuffs, live-stock, provisions, cot ton, lead (from the Missouri mines), hay, salt, wool, hides and pelts, lumber, to bacco, and groceries. There are, including those in East St. Louis, 6 grain elevat ors and warehouses, 5 establishments for storing and compressing cotton, and 2 stock-yards. In 1874 the receipts of grain amounted to 30,673,504 bushels, and the shipments to 24,417,411 bushels. St. Louis is the first city of the Union in the manufacture of flour. There were 24 mills in operation in 1874, which produced 1,573,202 barrels. The number of hogs packed during the season of 1873-'74 was 463,793. Vast as are its commercial interests, however, the prosperity of the city is chiefly due to its manufactures, in which it is surpassed only by New York and Philadelphia. The number of establishments in the county (mostly within the city limits) in 1870 was 4,579, employing 40,856 hands, and turning out products valued, in 1874, at nearly $240,000,000. Hotels, Restaurants, and Clubs. \u2014 The Southern Hotel ($4.50 a day), which occupies the square bounded by Walnut and Elm and 4th and 5th Sts., is the largest and finest in the Mississippi Valley. It is built of Athens stone, closely resembling mar ble, in the Anglo-Italian style, and is six stories high. The Planters' Hotel is a very large and fine hotel, occupying the entire block in 4th St. between Pine and Chestnut. The Lindell House is a new, elegant, and sumptuously -furnished hotel. Barnum's Hotel is a large brick building at the cor. of Walnut and 2d Sts., near the river. The Laclede Hotel is a well-kept house centrally located at the cor. of 5th and Chestnut Sts. Other good houses, on a smaller scale, are the Everett. House, St. Nicholas, Olive St. Hotel, and Broadway Hotel. The Grand Central in Pine St., between 4tb and 5th, is on the European plan (rooms $1 a day). The most popular restaurant in the city for ladies and gentlemen is French's, at the cor. of 5th and Pine Sts., or No. 201 N. 5th St. Porcher's, 900 Olive St., is famous for its dinners and suppers and for the excellence of its wines. There is an excellent restaurant in connection with the Southern Hotel, No. 107 S. 4th St. Other good restaurants are Sinder & Beer's, No. 910 Olive St. ; Game's, cor. 9th and Olive Sts.; Cafferetta, No. 101 N. 12th St.; Lamon Pezotte, No. 200 N. 5th St.; Nicholas Cantine, No. 408 Washington Ave. ; and the Hotel- Garni Restaurant, cor. 4th and Elm Sts. The cookery and service of many of these restaurants are in genuine French style. The Germania Club has a fine building at the cor. of 8th and Gratiot Sts., with"], [130, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 112 first-class restaurant, billiard-rooms and rooms for other games, and a spacious ball room. The University Club has a large and elegantly-furnished building. The privileges of either of these may be obtained on introduction by a member. There are other club-houses of less note. Railroad Depots. \u2014 The depot of the St. Louis, Kansas City & Northern R. R. is at the foot of Biddle St., 12 blocks N. of Market St. The depot of the Missouri Pa cific, of the Atlantic & Pacific, and of the Kansas & Texas Railroads, is at the cor. of Poplar and 7th Sts., 6 blocks S. of Market St. The depot of the Iron Mountain R. R. is at the foot of Plum St., 7 blocks below Market. All roads en tering the city from the N. and E., over the bridge, use the depot at 11th and Poplar Sts. Near here a new Union Depot on an immense scale^is being con structed. Modes of Conveyance. \u2014 Horse-cars traverse the city in every direction and render all parts easily accessible (fare 7c. ; 5 tickets for 25c). The cars on 4th and 5th Sts. run nearly the entire length of the city from N. to S. ; those on Market, Pine, Olive, Locust, Washington Ave. and Franklin Ave., run E. and W. Carriages are in waiting at the depots and steamboat-landings, and at stands in different parts of the city. The rates established by law are: For conveying 1 or more persons a distance of 1 m. or less, $1 ; more than 1 m. and less than 2 m., $1.50, and 50c. for each additional mile. By the hour, $2 for the first hour, and $1.50 for each addi- \u25a0 tional hour. In case of dis- agreement as to distance or fare, call a policeman, or complain at the City Hall. Ferries to East St. Louis from foot of Spruce St. and from foot of Cary St. Streets and Drives. \u2014 From the Levee, or river-front, the streets running N. and S. are numbered consecutively, be- ginning with Main or 1st St., 2d St., 3d St., etc. The notable exceptions to this are Carondelet Ave., which is a continuation of 4th and 5th Sts. southward ; Broad- way, a continuation of the same Sts. northward ; and Jefferson Ave., correspond- ing in part with 29th St. Streets running E. and W. are named arbitrarily or from some historical asso- ciation. The houses are numbered on the \" Philadel- phia system \" (see Philadel- phia), all streets running parallel to the river being numbered N. and S. from Market St. ; while on all streets running E. and W. the numbering begins at the Levee. Front St., which is 100 ft. wide, extends along the levee, and is built up with massive stone warehouses. This street, with Main and Second, is the location of the principal wholesale trade. Fourth St. is the fashionable promenade, and Court-House."], [131, "ST. LOUIS. 113 contains the leading retail stores. Grand Ave. is 12 m. long, running parallel with the river on the W. boundary of the city. Washington Ave. is one of the widest and handsomest in the city. The finest residences are on Lucas Place, in Pine, Olive, and Locust Sts., in Washington Ave. W. of 27th St., and in Chouteau Ave. The favorite drives are through the parks and boulevards, to be described further on. Public and Prominent Buildings. \u2014 The finest public building in the city, and one of the finest of its kind in the United States, is the Court-Honse, occupying the square bounded by 4th, 5th, Chestnut, and Market Sts. It is built of Genevieve limestone, in the form of a Greek cross, with a lofty iron dome surmounting its centre, and cost $1,200,000. The fronts are adorned with beautiful porticoes, and from the cupola of the dome (which is accessible to all) there is a fine view of the city and its surroundings. The City-Hall, cor. Market and 10th Sts., is a plain brick struct ure occupying half a square. The Four Courts is a spacious and elegant limestone building, in Clark Ave. between 11th and 12th Sts., recently finished at a cost of $1,000,000. In the rear is an iron jail, semicircular in form, and so constructed that all the cells are under the observation of a single watchman at once. (Strangers admitted on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from 8 to 9 a. m., and 3 to 4 p. m.) The Custom-House, which also contains the Post-Office, is a large and substantial edifice of Missouri marble, at the cor. of 3d and Olive Sts. A new Custom-House and Post-Office is in course of construction at the cor. of Olive and 8th Sts. It will occupy an entire block, will be of Maine granite with rose-colored granite trim mings, will be three stories high, with a French roof and Louvre dome, and is esti mated to cost $5,000,000. The U. S. Arsenal, situated in the extreme S. limits of the city, immediately on the river, is a beautiful spot (reached by 5th St. cars). The Merchants' Exchange, in Main St. between Market and Walnut, is the great commercial martr of the city. The main ball, or \"Exchange,\" is a fine room 102 by 81 ft. The sessions of the Exchange are from 11 A. M. to 1 P. M. Strangers are admitted to the floor on in troduction by a member; the galleries are f r e e to all. A new and magnificent Exchange is being erected in 3d St. be tween Pine and Chestnut. It is of gray limestone, and will cost $1, 000,000. The Masonic Temple, cor. Market and 7th Sts., is a very fineedi- The \"Four Courts.\" fice, with richly-decorated interior. The new St. Louis Life-Insurance Bnilding, cor. 6th and Locust Sts., is the most ornate and showy in the city. It is of rose-coiored granite, in the Renaissance style, four stories high, with a massive cornice on the roof upon which are mythological figures in stone. From the roof (reached by elevator) a fine view is obtained. The Republican Building, cor. 3d and Chestnut,"], [132, "114 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. is one of the most complete and elegant newspaper offices in the world. The Union Market occupies the square bounded by 5th, 6th, Greene, and Morgan Sts., and is well worth a visit. So is the St. Louis Elevator, on the Levee at the foot of Ashley St. It has a capacity of 2,000,000 bushels, and is one of the largest in the country. The Levee should also be visited. Theatres and Places of Amusement.\u2014 The leading theatre is De Bar's Opera-House, in Pine St. between 3d and 4th ; but there is no well-organized theatrical company in the city. The Olympic Theatre, in 5th between Walnut and Elm Sts., has a fine auditorium. The Apollo Gardens is a German theatre at the cor. of 4th and Poplar Sts., where the new and old operas may be heard throughout the season. The singing is usually very good, and between the acts the audience refreshes itself with beer and soda-water. The Varieties Theatre, in Market St. between 5th and 6th, is a favorite resort for gentlemen. There are numerous German beer-gardens, at the more aristocratic of which, such as Uhrig's and Schneider's, really fine music may be heard. Ladies and gentlemen resort to the gardens just as do the citizens of Berlin and Dresden. Libraries, Art-Galleries, etc. \u2014 The Mercantile Library is a large and handsome brick building at the cor. of 5th and Locust Sts. The library and reading-room are in the 2d story, and both are free to strangers (open from 9 a. m. to 10 p. m.). The library numbers 43,000 volumes, and the hall contains paintings, coins, and statuary, among which may be mentioned Miss Hosmer's life-size statues of Beatrice Cenci and \u0152none ; a bronze copy of the Venus de Medicis ; marble busts of Thomas H. Benton and Robert Burns ; and a sculptured slab from the ruins of Nineveh. The reading room is elegantly fitted up and well supplied with newspapers and magazines. The Public-School Library is on the 2d floor of the Polytechnic Building, cor. Chestnut and 7th Sts. It contains 38,000 volumes and a good reading-room, both of which are open to the public (from 10 A. m. to 10 p. m.). St. John's Circulating Library numbers 27,000 volumes, and the Law Library, in the Court-House, 7,100. The Academy of Science, founded in 1856, has a large museum and a library of 3,000 volumes. The Missouri Historical Society, founded in 1865, has a large historical collection. Both the preceding have rooms in the Polytechnic Building (3d floor). Churches. \u2014 The most imposing church edifice in the city is Christ Church (Epis copal), cor. 13th and Locust Sts. It is of stone, in cathedral-Gothic style, with stained-glass windows and lofty nave. The Cathedral (Roman Catholic), in Walnut St. between 2d and 3d, is an elegant edifice, with a front of polished freestone, ornamented by a Doric portico. It is surmounted by a lofty spire in which is a fine chime of bells. The Church of the Messiah (Unitarian), cor. Olive and 9th Sts., is a fine Gothic structure ; and the Second Presbyterian, cor. 17tb St. and Lucas Place, is another noble specimen of the Gothic style. St. George's (Episcopal), cor. Locust and 7th Sts., is an elegant building. The First Presbyterian, cor. 14th St. and Lucas Place, is a large and costly structure in the English-Gothic style, with richly decorated interior, and a peculiarly graceful and elegant spire. The Union Church (Methodist), cor. 11th and Locust Sts., is a good model of an old Lombard church, believed to be the only structure of the kind in the country. The Baptist Church, cor. 6th and Locust Sts., is a brick structure of handsome design. The following are also notably fine buildinas: the Congregational Church, in Locust. St. between 10th and 11th Sts. ; the Lutheran Church, cor. 8th and Walnut Sts. ; and the Pres byterian Churches, cor. 11th and Pine, and 16th and Walnut Sts. The Jewish Temple, cor. 16th and Pine Sts., is one of the finest ecclesiastical structures in the city. Educational and Charitable Institutions. \u2014 The St. Louis University (Jesuit), cor. 9th St. and Washington Ave., is the oldest educational institution in St. Louis, having been founded in 1829. It has a valuable museum, very complete philosophical and chemical apparatus, and a library of 17,000 volumes, among which are some rare specimens of early printing. In 1874-75 it had 22 instructors and 353 students. Washington University is a large and substantial building, cor. Pine and 16th Sts. The university was organized in 1853, and is intended to embrace the whole range of university studies, except theological. Connected with it are the Mary Institute,"], [133, "ST. LOUIS. 115 for the education of women ; the Polytechnic School, which has an elegant building at the cor. of Chestnut and 7th Sts. ; and the St. Louis Law School. In 1874-'75 there were 58 instructors connected with the different departments and 700 stu dents. The College of the Christian Brothers (Roman Catholic), cor. 8th and Gra tiot Sts., is a flourishing institution with about 400 students, and a library of 10,000 volumes. Concordia College (German Lutheran) was established in 1839, and has a library of 4,500 volumes. The public-school system of St. Louis is one of the best in the country, and the school-houses are exceptionally fine. The High School, cor. 15th and Olive Sts., is a beautiful building in the castellated Norman style. The Roman Catholics have about 100 parochial, private, and conventual schools. The County Insane Asylum, on the Arsenal road, 4\\ m. from the Court-House, is an immense brick and stone structure, occupying about 40 acres of ground, beauti fully laid out. On the premises is an artesian well, 3,843 ft. deep. The Asylum is open to visitors from 10 A. M. to 12 it., and from 2 to 5 p. m. The Poor-House and the House of Industry are just beyond, on the Arsenal road, and are spacious brick buildings. The Workhouse and the House of Refuge are 4 m. S. of the Court- House (reached, within \\ m., by Carondelet Ave. cars). The City Hospital, cor. Lafayette Ave. and Linn St., is a handsome building, situated in the midst of pleas ant grounds (reached by 4th St. cars ; open to visitors from 2 to 3 p. M.). The St. Louis Hospital, cor.

The Deaf and Dumb Asylum (Roman Catholic) is at the cor. of 26th St. and Christy Ave. St. Louis is famous for the number of its charitable institutions, of which we have found space to enumerate only a few. Parks, Pleasure-Grounds, and Cemeteries. \u2014 The public squares and parks embrace in the aggregate about 2,000 acres. The most beautiful is Lafayette Park, which em braces about 30 acres in the S. portion of the city (reached by Chouteau Ave. cars running on 4th St.). It is for pedestrians only, is admirably laid out and adorned, and is surrounded by elegant residences. In it are a bronze statue of Senator Benton, by Harriet Hosmer, and a bronze statue of Washington. Band concerts are given here on Thursday afternoons in summer. Missouri Park is a pretty little park of 4 acres, at the foot of Lucas Place, the 5th Avenue of St. Louis. In the centre is a handsome fountain. St. Louis Place and Hyde Park, in the N. part of the city, are attractive places of resort, the former containing 16 and the latter 12 acres. Washington Square (16 acres) lies on 12th St. and Clarke Ave., and is tastefully improved. Northern Park (180 acres), on the bluffs in the N. portion, is noted for its fine trees. Forest Park contains 1,350 acres, and lies 4 m. W. of the Court- House. It is still mostly covered with primitive trees, and the Des Peres River meanders through it. Lindell Boulevard (194 ft. wide) and Forest Park Boulevard (150 ft. wide) extend from it toward the heart of the city. Lindell Park (60 acres), on the line of Forest Park Boulevard, is tastefully laid out and filled with native forest-trees. Tower Grove Park, embracing 277 acres, lies in the S. W. part of the city (reached by Gravois Railway line, from 4th and Pine Sts.). It is beautifully laid out, with green lawns and shrubbery, and offers the pleasantest drives of any park in the city.\" Adjoining Tower Grove Park is Shaw's Garden, owned by Mr. Henry Shaw, who has opened it to the public, and intends it as a gift to the city. The garden con tains 109 acres, and is divided into three sections. The Herbaceous and Flower Garden, embracing 10 acres, contains almost every flower that can be grown in this latitude; and there are several greenhouses, in which are thousands of exotic and tropical plants. In the Fruticetum, comprising 6 acres, are fruits of all kinds. The Arborei,um is 25 acres in extent, and contains all kinds of ornamental and fruit trees that will grow in this climate. The Labyrinth is an intricate, hedge bordered pathway, leading to a summer-house in the centre. A brick building near Mr. Shaw's residence contains a museum and botanical library. On Sundays the garden is open only to strangers, who may procure tickets at the leading hotels."], [134, "116 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. The Fair-Grounds of the St. Louis Agricultural and Mechanical Association embrace 85 acres, 3 m. N. W. from the Court-House, are handsomely laid out and ornamented, and contain extensive buildings. The Amphitheatre will seat 40,000 persons. \"Fair-week,\" which is usually the first week in October, is the gala-season in St. Louis, and the stranger will be fortunate if he happens there at that time. The grounds are reached by cars on Franklin Ave. and 4th St. Bellefontaine Cemetery, the most beautiful in the West, is situated in the N. part of the city, about 44; m. from the Court-House (reached by 5th St. cars). It embraces 350 acres, is tastefully decorated with trees and shrubbery, and contains some fine monuments. Calvary Cemetery lies a short distance N. of Bellefontaine, and islittle inferior, either in size or beauty. The Bridge and the Water-Works. \u2014 The great bridge across the Mississippi, from the foot of Washington St. to a corresponding point in East St. Louis, is regarded as one of the greatest triumphs of American engineering. It was designed by James B. Eads, and was begun in 1869 and completed in 1874. It consists of three spans resting on four piers. The piers are composed of granite and limestone, and rest on the bed-rock of the river, to which they were sunk through the sand from 90 to 120 ft. by the use of wrought-iron caissons and atmospheric pressure. The centre span is 520 ft. and the side ones are each 500 ft. in the clear ; each of them is formed of four ribbed arches, made of cast-steel. The rise of the arches is 60 ft., suffi ciently high to permit the passage of steamboats at all stages of the water. The bridge is built in two stories ; the lower one containing a double car-track and the upper one two carriage-ways, two horse-car tracks, and two footways. It passes over a viaduct of five arches (27 ft. span each) into Washington Ave., where the lower roadway runs into a tunnel 4,800 ft. long, which passes under a large part of the city, terminating near 11th St. The total cost of bridge and tunnel was over Arch of St. Louis Bridge. $10,000,000. The city Water -Works are situated at Bissell's Point, on the bank of the river, 34. m. N. of the Court-House (reached by 5th St. cars). The buildings are substantial, and the two-pumping-engines, each with a capacity of 17,000,000 gallons a day, are worth seeing. The engine-rooms are open to visitors\" at all times. CHICAGO TO OMAHA. The tourist has the choice of three routes in making the journey from Chicago to Omaha: 1, via the Chicago & Northwestern R. R. (492 m.) ; 2, via Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific R. R. (493 m.) ; 3, via Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. (502 tn.). The distance by all is about the same, and the country traversed is not materially different. Each line traverses, for the larger portion of the way, the great prairie-region of the West, which thirty years ago was almost uninhabited,' save by the Indian and the trapper, but now teems with an industrious and thriving"], [135, "OMAHA TO SAN FRANCISCO. 117 population. Many of the villages and cities en route are attractive, and even pict uresque, but few have anything which would prove interesting to the tourist. The most important places on the Chicago & Northwestern R. R. are Fulton (136 m.), the last station in Illinois, and the point where a splendid iron bridge, 4,100 ft. long, crosses the Mississippi River; Cedar Rapids (219 m.), an important railroad centre in Iowa ; and Council Bluffs (488 m. 1, on the Missouri River, opposite Omaha. The approaches to Council Bluffs are striking, and the city itself is picturesquely situated at the foot of high and very precipitous bluffs. The principal points on the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific. R. R. are Joliet (40 m.), which has already been de scribed (see p. 110) ; Ottawa (84 m.), a flourishing city of 8,000 inhabitants, situated on both sides of the Illinois River; Moline (179 m.), which possesses the most ex tensive water-power in the Northwest; Rock Island City (182 m.), from which several fine bridges span the Mississippi River to the island of Rock Island, an im portant United States military station, and to Davenport, on the Iowa side of the river, the largest city in Iowa; Iowa City (237 m.), beautifully situated on the bluffs of the Iowa River ; and Des Moines (357 m.), the capital of Iowa, situated at the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers, and containing a fine Statt- House and other public buildings, and a population of about 15,000. The chief points on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy route are Aurora (38 m.), a flourishing manufacturing town on the Fox River; Galesburg (163 m.), noted as the seat of several colleges ; and Burlington (207 m.), on the Mississippi River, and, next to Davenport and Dubuque, the largest city in Iowa. Omaha is reached from Council Bluffs by the magnificent iron bridge across the Missouri River, which cost $1,000, 000, and affords unbroken railway connection from ocean to ocean. The city is finely situated on an elevated plateau, and contains many handsome buildings. Its growth has beenunprecedentedly rapid, as it dates from 1857, and in 1875 had 20.001 > inhabitants. Fare by either of the above routes, $16. OMAHA TO SAN FRANCISCO. ( Via Union Pacific and Central Pacific Railways. Distance, 1,914 m. Time. ty. days. Fare $100.) This journey, by reason of its great length and the time which it takes, will be in many respects a new experience to the traveler, no matter how extended his previous journeyings may have been. It is more like a sea- voyage than the ordinary rushing from point to point by rail, and, as on a sea-voyage, you cease to care about time-tables and connections, and make yourself comfortable. Says Mr. Charles Nordhoff, whose \" California, for Health, Pleasure, and Residence,\" will prove a useful companion for the journey: \"Until you have undertaken this journey, you will never know how great a difference it makes to your comfort whether your train goes at the rate of 40 or at 22 miles an hour. This last is the pace of the iron horse between Omaha and San Francisco; and it is to the fierce and rapid rush of an Eastern lightning-express what a gentle and easy amble is to a rough and jolting trot. Certainly a lightning-express rushing through from Chicago to San Francisco would not carry any one, except an expressman, a second time. At 40 or 45 miles per hour, the country you pass through is a blur; one hardly sees between the tele graph-poles; pleasureand ease are alike out of the question; reading tires your eyes, writing is impossible, conversation impracticable, except at the auctioneer pitch, and the motion is wearing and tiresome. But, at 22 miles per hour, travel by rail is a different affair; and having unpacked your books, and unstrapped your wraps, in your Pullman or Central Pacific Palace-car, you may pursue all the seden tary avocations and amusements of a parlor at home ; and as your housekeeping is done\u2014 and admirably done\u2014 for you by alert and experienced servants; as you may lie down at full length, or sit up, sleep or wake, at your choice ; as your dinner is sure to be abundant, very tolerably cooked, and not hurried ; as you are pretty cer tain to make acquaintances on the car ; and as the country through which you pass is strange, and abounds in curious and interesting sights, and the air is fresh and exhilarating \u2014 you soon fall into the ways of the voyage ; and if you are a tired busi- 9"], [136, "118 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. ness-man, or a wearied housekeeper, your careless ease will be such a rest as cer tainly most busy and overworked Americans know how to enjoy.\" In order to secure the comfort thus described, it will be necessary to engage a berth in the Pullman Palace-cars to Ogden, and in the Silver Palace-cars beyond Ogden. The cost of these is $8 from Omaha to Ogden, and $6 from Ogden to San Francisco, in addition to the cost of the regular ticket ; but no more fruitful outlay could be made. Attached to each train is an \"observation-car,\" consisting of an open platform, from which the scenery can be seen to greater advantage than in the inclosed cars. Good eating-stations are placed at proper intervals, and the train stops long enough for a meal to be eaten with reasonable deliberation. As there are 228 stations on the line, we cannot enumerate even the more im portant, and it will prove more useful to the traveler, perhaps, to direct his atten tion in a general way to the characteristic features of the different sections of the route. During the first day out from Omaha, the road traverses vast prairies, which the tourist now sees for the first time in something like their primitive nakedness and solitude. Settlements and farms are still seen, but, unlike those in the more populous States east of the Mississippi, they appear to be swallowed up in the im mensity of the interminable levels which roll off to the horizon like the sea. On the left is the Platte River, through whose valley, entered at Elkhorn (29 m.), the road runs for nearly 400 m. North Platte (291 m.) is the principal town on this section of the line, and contains a fine hotel, round-house, and machine-shop, belonging to the railway company. Shortly beyond, the rich farming-lands of Nebraska are left \"behind, and the road enters a vast grazing country, which extends to the base of the Rocky Mountains, and is covered summer and winter with nutritious grasses. Herds of antelope are seen feeding quietly on the verdurous slopes, villages of prairie-dogs break the monotony of the level, and occasionally a glimpse is obtained of buffaloes. Sidney (414 m.) is the largest place between North Platte and Cheyenne, and is quite a prosperous village, with round-house, repair-shops, hotel, and eating-house. Just before reaching Archer (508 m.), the first glimpse is obtained of the Rocky Mountains, whose snow-clad tops are at first mistaken for clouds. Long's Peak, 14,000 ft. high, soon becomes plainly visible, and the Spanish Peaks are in the dim distance ; while away to the N., as far as the eye can reach, the dark line of the Black Hills leans against the horizon. Cheyenne (516 m.) is one of the largest towns on the entire road, though settled only in 1867. It now has a population of 2,500, is the point of junction with the Denver Pacific Railway, and has an extensive round-house and shops. A few miles beyond Cheyenne, the ascent of the Rocky"], [137, "OMAHA TO SAN FRANCISCO. 119 Mountains is begun, and for 30 m. the road climbs rugged granite hills, winding in and out of interminable snow-sheds. Sherman (549 m.) is the highest railroad sta tion in the world (8,235 ft.) and affords grand views. Here commences the descent to the Laramie Plains, a vast wilderness which for the next 200 m. the road trav erses. Nothing flourishes on these alkaline uplands but sage-brush, while jackass rabbits, and horned toads with genuine tails, are almost the only specimens of ani mal life to be seen. Creston (737 m.) is the dividing ridge of the continent, from which waters flow each way, E. to the Atlantic, and W. to the Pacific. At Green River Station (845 m.) the train emerges from the desolate plains, and enters a moun tain-region, which affords some fine views. Utah Territory is entered at Granger (876 m.). Within this region, between Green River and Salt Lake Valley, we pass through five tunnels, aggregating nearly 2,000 ft., and cut through solid rock, which never crumbles, and consequently does not require to be arched with brick. Castle- Rock (975 m.) is a station at the head of Echo Canon, and we then enter a region whose grand and beautiful scenery has been often described. Echo Gallon and We ber Canon are two of the most magnificent sights on the whole Pacific route, and the tourist will be fortunate if he passes them by daylight, The road winds through all the devious turns of these canons, while rock-ribbed mountains, bare of foliage, except a stunted pine, and snow-capped, rise to an awful height on either hand. Emerging from these grim battlements of rock, we catch the first view of Salt Lake Valley, and soon reach Ogden (1,032 m.). This is the point of junction between the Union and Central Pacific Railways, and of the Utah Central Railway, which ex tends to Salt Lake City, 32 m. distant. Leaving Ogden, the road skirts the N. shore of the Great Salt Lake, while the Mormon city lies near the S. end of it. The lake is 126 m. long and 45 m. wide, as quiet and placid amid its mountain-barriers as the water in a basin. Promontory Point (1,084 m.) is interesting as the spot where the two companies building the Pacific Railways joined their tracks on May 10, 1869. Beyond this the road enters upon an extended plateau, about 60 m. long and of the same width, known as the Great American Desert. Its whole surface is covered with a sapless weed 5 or 6 inches high, and never grows any green thing that could sustain animal life. The only living things found upon it are lizards and jackass-rabbits; and the only landscape feature is dry, brown, and bare mountains. At Toano (1,214 m.) the Humboldt Valley, a comparatively fertile region, is entered ; here commences a long descending grade which extends to the Sierra Nevada Moun tains. Elko (1,307 m.) is the most important station on this portion of the line, and is the shipping-point for the famous White Pine mining district of Nevada. At"], [138, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 120 Wadsworth (1,587 m.) the ascent of the Sierra Nevadas is begun. Ihe wearying sight of plains covered with alkali and sage-brush is exchanged for picturesque views of mountain-slopes, adorned with branching pine-trees, and diversified with foaming Salt Lake City. torrents. The ascent soon becomes so steep that two locomotives are required to draw the train. At short intervals there are strong wooden snow-sheds, erected to guard the line against destruction by snow-slides. These sheds, which are very much like tunnels, interrupt the views of some of the most romantic scenery on the line. Truckee (1,656 m.) is the first important station in California. Excursionists for Donner Lake and Lake Tahoe leave the railroad here. Summit Station (1,671 m.) is the highest point on the Central Pacific road (7,042 ft.), and the scenery around the station is indescribably beautiful and impressive. \" A grander or more exhilarating ride than that from Summit to Colfax,\" says Mr. Nordhoff, \"you can not find in the world. The scenery is various, novel, magnificent. You sit in an open car at the end of the train, and the roar of the wind, the rush and vehement impetus of the train, and the whirl around curves, past the edge of deep chasms, among forests of magnificent trees, fill you with excitement, wonder, and delight. . . . The entrance to California is as wonderful and charming as though it were the gate to a veritable fairy-land. All its sights are peculiar and striking: as you pass down from Summit the very color of the soil seems different from and richer than that you are accustomed to at home; the farmhouses, with their broad piazzas, speak of a summer climate ; the flowers, brilliant at the roadside, are new to Eastern eyes; and at every turn of the road new surprises await you.\" Saeramento (1,775 m.) is the capital of California, and is the second city of the State in size. It is situ ated at the head of navigation on the Sacramento River, is an important railroad and manufacturing centre, and contains 24,000 inhabitants. The State Capitol here is one of the finest public buildings in the United States. The journey from Sacramento to San Francisco is very pleasant, but without, special interest, being for the most part through the highly-cultivated valleys of the Sacramento and San Joaquin. Stockton (1,823 m.) is the third city of California in size, contains 12,000 inhabitants, and is situated at the head of tide-navigation on the San Joaquin River. Oakland (1,910 m.) is abeautiful city of 12,000 inhabitants,"], [139, "SAN FRANCISCO. 121 on the E. shore of San Francisco Bay, almost directly opposite San Francisco itself. The train passes through the city to Oakland Point, where the company has built an immense pier 2J m. intojthe bay. From this pier (which is well worth notice) a ferry-boat conveys the passengers and freight to San Francisco, 3 m. distant. SAN FRANCISCO. FRANCISCO, the chief city of California, and commercial metropolises the. \u00a3j Pacific coast, is situated at the N. end of a peninsula which is 30 m. long and 6 m. across at the city, and separates San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean, in lat. 37\u00b0 46' N. and Ion. 122\u00b0 46' W. The city stands on the E. or inner slope of the peninsula and at the base of high hills. In 1846 these hills were steep and cut up by numerous gullies, and the low ground at their base was narrow, save in what is now the S. part of the city, where there was a succession of ridges of loose, bar- ren sand, im passable for loaded wag on s . The \u2022sand - ridges have been leveled, the gullies and hollows filled up, and the hills cut <lown ; and where large ships rode at anchor in 1849 there are no w paved streets. The greater part of the peninsula is hilly, bare of trees, and un fit for culti vation ; and there is but \u2022one road lead- \u25a0State Capitol os California, at Sacramento. ing out of the city. The business streets are built up densely, but beyond that the houses are scattered at considerable intervals, and the settled part of the city may be said to cover an area of 9 sq. m. In the N. E. corner of the city is Telegraph Hill, 294 ft. high; in the S. E. corner Rincon Hill, 120 ft. high; and on the W. -side Russian Hill, 360 ft. high. The densely-populated quarters are in the amphi theatre formed by the three hills. The city is regularly laid out, though not on a uniform plan ; the streets are broad and cross each other at right angles. The busiest streets are paved with Belgian blocks or cobble-stones, and most of the residence streets are planked. The history of San Francisco is interesting on account of the rapid growth of the place. The first house was built in 1835, when the village was called Yerba Bnena, which in Spanish means \"good herb,\" so named from a medicinal plant growing in abundance in the vicinity. In 1847 this was changed to San Francisco, and in 1848, the year that gold was first discovered in California by the white settlers, the popu lation had increased to 1,000. The influx from the East then commenced, and in December, 1850. the population was about 25.000. In 1860 it was 56,802; in 1870"], [140, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 122 149,473 ; and in February, 1875, the number was estimated by local authorities at 230,000. The city was incorporated in 1850, and the city and county were consoli dated in 1856. In 1851 and 1856, in consequence of bad municipal government and corrupt administration of the criminal laws, the people organized Vigilance Com mittees, and summarily executed several criminals and banished others. This rough but wholesome discipline had its effect, and the city is now one of the most orderly in the country. The commerce of San Francisco is very large, the chief articles of export being \"the precious metals, breadstuff's, wines, and wool ; and of import, lum ber, coal, coffee, tea, rice, and sugar. In 1874 the number of sea-going vessels that arrived was 4,204, and during the same period $30,000,000 of treasure was ex ported. The manufactures are important, including woolen and silk mills, and manufactories of watches, carriages, boots, furniture, candles, acids, wire-work, castings of iron and brass, and silver- ware. Hotels, Restaurants, and Clubs. \u2014 The Palace Hotel, the largest building of its kind in the world and the most complete in its appointments, is 275 by 350 ft. on the ground, nine stories high, can accommodate 1,200 guests, and cost with land and furniture $3,250,000. The Grand Hotel, cor. Market and New Montgomery Sts., is a large and well-kept house ($3 a day). Other first-class hotels are : the Occidental ($3 a day), in Montgomery St., extending from Bush to Sutter ; the Lick House ($3 a day), in Montgomery St. between Post and Sutter ; and the Cosmopolitan ($3 a day), cor. Bush and Sansome Sts. The Russ House ($2.50 a day) is an old-established hotel, cor. Montgomery and Bush Sts. Good accommodations at from $1.75 to $2.50 a day can be obtained at the American Exchange, 319 Sansome St. ; the Brooklyn Hotel, 210 Bush St. ; and the International Hotel, 532 Jackson St. There are many cheap lodging-houses where comfortable rooms may be had at from 25 to 50 cts. per night; the most frequented of these is the What Cheer, in Sacramento St., formerly the best hotel in the city. Restaurants are a peculiar feature of San Francisco, and no other city in the United States can compare with it in this respect. Restaurants, chop-houses, rotis series, abound in every quarter. A great many are first class, and so nearly on a par that it is difficult to make a selection. Chop-houses and rotisseries differ from restaurants, in that the cooking-furnaces are arranged on one side of the room, and each person can select the raw food and have it cooked right before his eyes. There are also numerous table-d'hotes, where, by paying from 50 cts. to $1, one can sit at the table and call for anything he likes, provided it is on the bill of fare, including wines. Martin's, in Commercial St. near Montgomery, is noted for its excellent suppers. The Union Club has an elegant building at the cor. of Montgomery and Cali fornia Sts. The stone of which it is constructed was quarried and cut in China. The Olympic Club has extensive and handsomely-furnished rooms at 35 Sutter St. The San Francisco Verein, 428 Pine St., has a library of 6,000 volumes and a well supplied reading-room. The Pacific Turner Bund, for the cultivation of gymnastic exercises, has rooms at Turnverein Hall, in O'Farrell St. between Mason and Taylor. Introduction by a member secures the privileges of these clubs. Depots and Modes of Conveyance. \u2014 The only railroad terminating within the city lim its is the Southern Pacific. The Central Pacific terminates at Oakland, on the E. side of San Francisco Bay (reached by ferry from foot of Pacific St.) ; and the California, Pacific, and San Francisco & North Pacific lines terminate on Sair Pablo Bay, N. of the city (reached by ferry). Horse-cars intersect the city in every direction, and render all points easily accessible. There are also omnibuses to different suburban points. Carriages are in waiting at the steamer-landings and at various stands in the city. Ferries to Oakland and San Antonio from foot of Pacific St. ; to Alameda front foot of Davis St. ; to Contra Costa from foot of Vallejo St. ; to San Quentin from foot of Broadway ; and to Saucelito from Meigs's Wharf. Streets and Drives. \u2014 The leading thoroughfare and most fashionable promenade is Montgomery St., which is broad and lined with handsome buildings. At its N. end it extends to the top of a hill, which is so precipitous that carriages cannot ascend"], [141, "SAN FRANCISCO. 123 it. A flight of steps enables pedestrians to mount with comparative ease ; and from the top there is a fine view over the city and bay. Kearney St. and Market St. are also fashionable promenades, and contain some of the principal retail shops. In California St. the principal banks and brokers' and insurance offices are located. The importers and jobbers are in Front, Sansome, and Battery Sts. The hand somest private residences are in Van Ness Ave., Pine St. Hill, and Taylor, Bush, Sutter, Post, Geary, and O'Farrell Sts. The \" Chinese Quarter \" comprises por tions of Sacramento, Commercial, Dupont, Pacific, and Jackson Sts. \u2014 The favorite drive is to the Cliff House, which is situated on the edge of the cliffs on the S. side of the entrance to the Golden Gate (7 m. from the city). A fine, broad, macad amized road leads to it, which is watered in dusty weather, and is as smooth and well kept as a race-course. The Cliff House is described further on. The road passes beyond the hotel to a broad, beautiful beach several miles long, over which at low tide one can drive to the Ocean House at its extreme end, and return to the city by a road behind the Mission hills. Another popular drive is to Hunter's Point, 44, m. S. E. from the City Hall. Public and Prominent Buildings. \u2014 A stranger's first impression of San Francisco is that there are no public buildings, though the new City Hall, in process of erection City Hall. San Francisco. in Yerba Buena Park, bounded by Market, MacAllister, and Larkin Sts., will be a tine structure, surpassed by few in the United States. The old City Hall, of stuc coed brick, two stories high, stands in Kearney St., between Washington and Mer chant (opposite the Plaza). The Custom-House, which also contains the Post-Office, is a plain but substantial building at the cor. of Battery and Washington Sts. The D. S. Branch Mint is on the upper floors of a rather shabby old building in Commercial St., near Montgomery, and is well worth a visit (visitors admitted from 9 a. m. to 12 M'.). At this establishment is made two-thirds of all the gold and silver coin manufactured in the United States. A new and massive building for the mint is going up at the cor. of Mission and 5th Sts. It will be of stone, in the Doric-Ionic style, and will cost $1,500,000. The U. S. Treasury is located at 428 Montgomery St. (office-hours from 9 A. M. to 3 p. M.). The Hall of Records, cor. Kearney and Washington Sts., occupies the old \" El Dorado,\" the famous gambling-hell of early San Francisco. The Merchants' Exchange, on the S. side of California St., between Montgomery and Sansome, is one of the most elegant and spacious buildings in the city. The Exchange is a splendid room in the first story, with lofty ceiling, and is well supplied with the leading papers and magazines, home and foreign. In the tower over the building is a fine clock. The most notable commercial buildings."], [142, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 124 besides the hotels, are those of the Bank of California, the Nevada Bank, and the Safe-Deposit Bank, all in California St. Theatres and Places of Amusement. \u2014 The California Theatre, in Bush St., near Kear ney, is one of the finest buildings in the city. It is devoted to legitimate drama and star performances. The Grand Opera-House, in Washington St., near Montgomery, is also a handsome building. The performances are mostly opera- bouffe- and bur lesques. The Metropolitan Theatre, in Montgomery St., between Washington and Jackson, is one of the oldest on the coast, and has a large and fine auditorium. The. Bella Union Theatre is in Kearney St., near Washington. The Alhambra Theatre, in Bush St., between Montgomery and Kearney, is devoted to varieties and negro minstrelsy. Woodward's Gardens, in Mission St., between 13th and 14th Sts., is the Barnum's of San Francisco. It contains a Museum of Curiosities, an Art-Gallery, and a Menagerie ; and the grounds are tastefully laid out. The City Gardens, in Folsom St., between 12th and 13th, are a popular resort. There are two Chinese Theatres, one on the E. side of Dupont St., between Clay and Washington ; the other on the N. side of Jackson St., between Kearney and Dupont. No stranger in San Francisco should fail to visit one of these (see \" Chinese Quarter \"). The Race-course is near Hunter's Point, 5 m. S. of the City Hall. Libraries, Art-Galleries, etc. \u2014 The building of the Mercantile Library Association, in Bush St., between Montgomery and Sansome, is large and fine, of brick with brown stone trimmings, 4 stories high. The rooms are spacious, well-arranged, and ele gantly furnished. The library contains 40,000 volumes, and there are several read ing-rooms, chess-rooms, and a gallery of pictures and statuary. The Odd-Felloivs' Library, in Odd-Fellows' Hall, 325 and 327 Montgomery St., numbers 25,000 vol umes, and has an excellent reading-room attached. The Mechanics' Institute Li brary occupies a substantial building in Post St., between Montgomery and Kear ney. It contains 30,000 volumes, and has a well-supplied reading-room. The Law Library, in Montgomery Block, contains over 15,000 volumes. The Society of California Pioneers, in Pioneer Hall (Montgomery St., near Jackson), has a good library and reading-room, together with a collection of many interesting relics of early times. The Academy of Sciences has rooms in the Mechanics' Institute building. Churches. \u2014 The largest and finest church-edifice on the Pacific Coast is St. Pat rick's (Roman Catholic), in Mission St., between 3d and 4th. It is of brick, 160 by 90 ft., with a spire 240 ft. high. St. Mary's Cathedral (Roman Catholic), cor. Cali fornia and Dupont Sts., is a noble building in the Gothic style, with a spire 200 ft. high. St. Francis's (Roman Catholic), in Vallejo St., between Dupont and Stock ton, is a large brick structure, in the Gothic style, with four towers, each 90 ft. high. St. Joseph's (Roman Catholic), in 10th St., between Folsom and Howard, is in the cruciform Gothic style, with richly-decorated interior. Grace Church (Episco pal), cor. California and Stockton Sts., is a stately stone building with stained-glass windows. Trinity Church (Episcopal), cor. Post and Powell Sts., has a lofty tower and spire, and a fine interior. The Calvary Presbyterian, cor. Geary and Powell Sts., is a large and costly edifice, in the Composite style, with 10 small towers rising above the roof. The First Unitarian (Horatio Stebbins, pastor), in Geary St., between Dupont and Stockton, is one of the finest churches in the city, remarkable for the purity of its architectural design, and the elegance of its interior finish. The First Methodist, in Powell St., between Washington and Jackson, was founded in 1849, and is the oldest of the denomination in the city. The First Bap tist is in Washington St., between Dupont and Stockton; the Columbia Square Baptist, in Russ St., between Howard and Folsom ; and the First Congregational, cor. California and .Dupont Sts. The Jewish synagogue of Emanu-El, in Sutter St., between Stockton and Powell, is a large, elegant, and substantial structure, with 2 lofty towers, and richly-decorated interior. That of the Shcritu-Isracl, cor. Post and Taylor Sts., is an imposing structure ; the lofty ceiling, arched and frescoed in imitation of the sky at night, is much admired. The Chinese Mission House, cor. Stockton and Sacramento Sts., will prove interesting to strangers. Eilni -iifiiin.il anl Charitable Institutions. \u2014 The most important educational institution"], [143, "SAN FRANCISCO. 125 in or near San Francisco is the Unicersity of California, which has handsome build ings at Berkeley, 4 m. N. of Oakland. In the city is an excellent School of Design, two Medical Colleges, and three Academies. The public schools accommodate 30, 000 pupils in regular attendance. Among the charitable institutions the principal are the United States Marine Hospital, an extensive building on a commanding emi nence at the c'or. of Mission and 15th Sts. ; the City Hospital, cor. Stockton and Francisco Sts. ; St. Mary's Hospital (Roman Catholic), cor. Bryant and 1st Sts. ; the State Woman's Hospital, 21 Hawthorne St. ; the Almshouse, on the San Miguel Road, in the suburbs ; the Protestant Orphan Asylum, in Laguna St., near Haight ; and the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum, in Market St., near 3d. The Alameda Park Asylum for the Insane is situated on the Encinal, Alameda. The fine build ing of the State Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind, near Oakland, was burned in 1875. Parks, Public Squares, aud Cemeteries. \u2014 The parks of San Francisco are in the fu ture, though a commencement has been made with the Golden Gate Park, S. of the city, which contains 1,043 acres, and is now being beautified. Portsmouth Square, commonly called the Plaza (W. side Kearney St. from Washington to Clay Sts.), is inclosed with a handsome iron railing, is tastefully laid out with gravel-walks, trees, shrubs, and grass-plats, and has a fountain in the centre. There are a number of other public squares in different parts of the city, but none of them have been much improved. Across the bay at Alameda, Oakland, and Saucelito, are some large and beautiful public gardens. Lone Mountain Cemetery is in many respects un surpassed. It lies 24; m. W. of the principal hotels (reached by horse-cars). Within the inclosure of the cemetery is a singular mountain, of conical shape, which rises up singly and alone to a considerable height above the surrounding country, which is tolerably level. On its summit is a large wooden cross; and both mountain and cross are very conspicuous, and may be seen from almost any part of the city. There are several fine monuments in the cemetery, that of Senator Broderick and Rals ton's (modeled after the Pantheon at Rome) being especially noteworthy ; but the great feature is Lone Mountain, with its unrivaled outlook, embracing views of the city, bay, ocean, Mount Diablo, and the Coast Range. There are several other cemeteries in the immediate vicinitv of Lone Mountain, chief among which is Laurel Hill. The \"Chinese Quarter.\" \u2014 There are about 20,000 Chinese in San Francisco, and their \"quarter\" has already been defined as comprising portions of Sacramento, Commercial, Dupont, Pacific, and Jackson Sts. Here they hold undisputed posses sion of several blocks, and the houses are crammed from sub-cellar to attic. No stranger in San Francisco, who has leisure, should fail to visit one of the two Chinese Theatres. He will find the entire audience, even the ladies, who have a compartment to themselves, smoking either tobacco or opium, and the performance is carried on amid the clashing of cymbals, the beating of drums and gongs, the blowing of trumpets, and other kinds of noise. The stage is about 10 ft. high, and covered on all sides with dirty, faded red-and-yellow paper and black Chinese let ters. Faded gilt stripes are here and there observable ; pieces of tin, like sardine boxes, piled on top of each other, are nailed to the walls; wings, tails, and heads of birds are hung up with old tin pans, broken chairs, legless tables, dirty coats, hats, and pants, rusty swords, broomsticks burned black for spears, peacock-feathers, red and yellow stripes of muslin, old boots and shoes, wooden animals painted every color but the natural, junks with sails set, armies marching, and bulls fighting. The orchestra sit on the stage and smoke all the time; and the performance does not commence until they have worn themselves out with making noise. . Several fel lows, clad in green, red, and yellow costumes, with long feathers sticking out from the backs of their necks, wings on their shoulders, and large masks in imitation of bulls, horses, and other animals, then begin strutting about and shouting to each other; and that is the play. A visit to the Gambling-houses and Opium-cellars will repay the curious tourist ; but it had better be made in company with a policeman. The Chinese are probably the most inveterate gamblers in the world, and they all gamble. In a cellar, greasy and dirty and filled with smoke, eighty or a hundred"], [144, "126 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. will be found sitting around tables betting. Their mode of gambling is simple : some one throws a handful of copper-coins on the table and after putting up stakes they bet whether the number of coins is odd or even ; then they count them and declare the result. Often in a single night they will gamble away several months' earnings. The opium-cellars are fitted up with benches or shelves, on each of which will be found a couple of Chinamen lying on the boards with a wooden box for a pillow. They smoke in pairs : while one smokes and prepares the opium, the other is dozing in a half-drunken sleep. There are three Temples, and at all times the visitor will find them open and any number of joss-sticks smoking in front of the favorite gods. Suburbs. \u2014 The point of chief interest in the vicinity of San Francisco is the Cliff Honse, a low, rambling building, set on the edge of some cliffs rising sharply from the ocean and facing west. It is 6 m. from the city, and is reached by the Point Lobos Road, a fine, admirably-kept boulevard, on which riders and vehicles of every description are met, especially Saturday afternoon, the half-holiday of business men. The restaurant attached to the house is famous for its excellence, and it is a delight ful experience to drive down in the early morning, before the summer northers be gin to blow, and breakfast there. Seal Rock is close by the hotel, and the greatest charm of the place is to lounge on the wide, shady piazza and watch the seals bask ing in the sun or wriggling over the rocks, barking so noisily as to be heard above the roar of the breakers. Northward lies the Golden Gate, the beautiful entrance to San Francisco Bay. Southward is the beach, upon which the waves beat cease lessly, and beyond, a rocky shore whose outlines melt in the blue distance. In front is the vast Pacific ocean, on whose distant horizon on a clear day the peaks of the Farallone Islands are visible. At Hunter's Point, 4\\ m. S. E. of the City Hall, is a Dry Dock, cut out of the solid rock, and said to be one of the finest in the world. The drive to it is across an arm of the bay, and affords varied and pleasant views. The Mission Dolores, the old mission of San Francisco, lies 3i m. S. W. of the city (reached by Market St. cars and also by omnibus). It is an'adobe building of the old Spanish style, built in 1778. Adjoining it is the cemetery, with its well-worn paths and fantastic monuments. Alameda, Saucelito, and Oakland, across the Bay (reached by ferry), are beautiful towns with fine public gardens. WASHINGTON TO RICHMOND ROUTE 1. ( Via Baltimore & Potomac R. E. Distance, 116 m. Tims, 5 hrs. Fare, about $5.) TnE train leaves the depot in Washington at the cor. of 6th and B. Sts., crosses the Long Bridge into Virginia, and runs down parallel with the Potomac to Alex andria, which is described on p. 50. Here the road leaves the Potomac and runs S. E. across a broken and rather desolate-looking country to Fredericksburg (55 m.), a quaint aud venerable old town on the S. shore of the Rappahannock River. Fred ericksburg was founded in 1727, and is notable as the scene of one of the severest battles of the civil war, fought December 13, 1862, in which General Burnside was defeated by General Lee. Many traces of this bloody conflict still remain, and may be seen from the cars, as the train passes directly across the battle-field. In the vicinity are a National and a Confederate cemetery, the latter being adorned with a monument. At Hanover Junction (92 m.) another battle was fought between General Grant and General Lee in May, 1864. The works occupied by the two armies may still be seen. Ashland (99 m.) is a place of recent origin, and a favorite residence of many citizens of Richmond. Near here was the birthplace of Henry Clav, who was often, when a boy, seen riding with a bag to mill, from which he received the name of the \" Mill-boy of the Slashes,\" a term applied to the neighboring country. Richmond (116 m.) is described on the next page."], [145, "RICHMOND. 127 WASHINGTON TO RICHMOND.\u2014 RO UTE II. {Via steamer to Aquia Creek, and thence via Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac R. R.

This is a pleasant way of reaching Richmond when a couple of hours more or less are of no importance to the traveler. The trip down the Potomac is made by day, and affords good views of the river scenery and the various places of interest on its bank \u2014 Alexandria, Arlington, and Mount Vernon. In passing the latter place the bell of the boat is always tolled. Aquia Creek (55 m.) was an impor tant military depot during the war for the Federal forces operating in the region N. of Fredericksburg. From Fredericksburg (69 m.) the line is identical with that described in the preceding route. RICHMOND. (Besides the foregoing methods of reaching Richmond, it may be reached from Baltimore via steam- er down Chesapeake Bay to Norfolk ; thence by steamer up James River. Also via steamer from Baltimore dowu Chesapeake Bay and up York River to West Point ; thence by rail [38 m.] to Richmond. From New York direct via \" Old Dominion Line\" of steamers [three times a week.]> RICHMOND, the capital and largest city of Virginia, is situated on the N. bank of the James River, about 100 m. by water from Chesapeake Bay. The city is built on several eminences, the principal of which are Richmond and Shockoe Hills, which are separated by Shockoe Creek, and is surrounded by beautiful scenery. It is regularly laid out and well built ; the streets, which are lighted with gas, cross each other at right angles. It was founded in 1737, was incorporated in 1742, and became the State capital in 1779, at which period it was a small village. The city was, in turn, the scene of the conventions of 1788, to ratify the Federal Constitu tion, those of 1829, 1850, and 1861, aud other important political gatherings, which largely shaped the destinies of the Commonwealth. In 1861 still greater prominence was given to it as the capital of the Southern Confederacy ; and one of the great aims of the Federal authorities, throughout the war, was to reduce it into their pos session. The obstinacy with which the Confederates defended it was a proof of the great importance which they attached to its retention. To effect this, strong lines of earthworks were drawn around the place, and may still be seen as memorials of the great struggle. When General Lee evacuated Petersburg, April 2, 1865, the troops defending Richmond on the E. were withdrawn, and, to prevent the tobacco warehouses and public stores from falling into the hands of the Federal forces, the buildings \u2014 together with the bridges over James River \u2014 were fired. This resulted in the destruction of a large part of the business section of the city, extending from the Spottswood Hotel, on Main St., for nearly a mile toward Rockett's, the lower suburb \u2014 the number of buildings destroyed having been estimated at 1,000, and the loss at $8,000,000. With the cessation of hostilities, Richmond set to wrork to rebuild her blackened quarters, which she has now almost wholly accomplished, and the city is rapidly recovering its former prosperity. The population in 1870 was 51,038, and had increased in 1874 to 60,705. The commerce is large, the chief articles of export being tobacco and flour. The latter is noted for its excellent qual ity, and is mostly shipped to Brazil. Great quantities of tobacco are shipped to the North. The manufactures give employment to over 4,000 men, and include iron works, machine-shops, founderies, sugar-refineries, cigar-factories, coach and wagon factories, furniture, sheetings and shirtings, and stoneware. Five lines of railroad intersect at Richmond, and regular lines of steamers run to Norfolk, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. Hotels, Restaurants, and Clubs. \u2014 The leading hotels are the Exchange Hotel and Bol lard House, facing and connected with each other in Franklin St. below the Capitol ($3 a day). The St. James Hotel ($2.50 a day) is in 12th St., facing the Capitol Square. Ford's Hotel ($2.50 a day) is in Main St. The best restaurants for ladies and gentlemen are Pozzini's, 807 E.

Public and Prominent Bnildings.\u2014 The most prominent public building of Richmond, smd by far the most conspicuous object in the city, or from its approaches, is the State Capitol, standing, in the centre of a park of 8 acres, on the summit of Shockoe Hill. It is a Gr\u00e6co - Com posite build ing, adorned with a portico of Ionic col umns, the plan having been fur nished by Thomas Jef ferson after that of the Maison carree at Nismes, in France. The view from the portico is ex tensive and be au t i fu 1 , taking in the James River, with its wind- Capitol at Richmond. ings and numerous islands. In the centre of the building is a square hall sur mounted by a dome, beneath which stands Houdon's celebrated statue of Washing ton. The statue is of marble, of the size of life, and represents Washington as clad in the uniform worn by an American general during the Revolution. The left hand rests on a bundle of fasces, on which hang a military cloak and a small \u25a0sword, and against which leans a plough. The attitude is natural and easy, and the likeness to the great original is said to be strong. On one side of the pedestal is the following inscription : \" The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Vir ginia have caused this statue to be erected, as a monument of affection and gratitude, to George Washington, who, uniting to the endowments of the Hero the virtues of the Patriot, and exerting both in establishing the Liberties of his Country, has rendered his name dear to his Fellow-Citizens, and given the World an immortal Example of true Glory. Done in the year of Christ One Thousand Seven Hundred :\\nd Eighty-eight, and in the year of the Commonwealth the Twelfth.\" Near the statue of Washington, in a corner of the ball, stands an antique English stove, cov ered with ornamental chasings and inscriptions, which dates back far beyond the Revolution, and was used to warm the old Virginia House of Burgesses at Williams burg in colonial times. In a niche in the wall is a marble bust of Lafayette. On the esplanade leading from the Governor's house to the W. gate of the Capitol Square, and near the latter, is Crawford's equestrian Statue of Washington, consisting of a bronze horse and rider, of colossal size, rising from a massive granite pedestal, and surrounded by bronze figures of Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, John Mar shall, George Mason, Thomas Nelson, and Andrew Lewis. The horse is half thrown upon his haunches, and is thought to be one of the finest bronzes in the world. A life-size marble statue of Henry Clay (near the W. corner) completes the decora tions of the Capitol Square, which is a favorite resort of the citizens and of strangers."], [147, "RICHMOND. 129 The City Hall is an elegant structure at the N. W. angle of Capitol Square. The Governor's House is a plain building on the N. E. corner of the square. The Custom-House, which also contains the Post- Office, is a handsome structure of gran- ite, in the Italian style, in Main St., between 10th and 11th. The Medical College, in rear of the Monumental Church, is a fine specimen of the Egyptian style of architecture. In the vicinity is the Brockenbrough House, which was the resi dence of Jeft'erson Davis, Presi dent of the Southern Confeder acy ; it is now used as a school house. The State Penitentiary is a large whitewashed brick building, in the W. suburbs of the city. Other prominent buildings are the Libby and Castle Tliunder Prisons ; but these are mere tobacco-ware houses, of no interest apart from the associations connect ed with them. Theatres and Places of Amuse ment. \u2014 The old Richmond The atre, in Broad St., built in con sequence of the destruction by fire of the former theatre, on the site of the Monumental Church, is a handsome and spa cious building, with a neat au ditorium. Other well-conduct- ed places of amusement are the Statue of Washington Virginia Hall and the Assembly Hall. Churches. \u2014 The churches of Richmond are numerous, and several of them are handsome specimens of architecture. Those with historic associations are St. John's and the Monumental. St. John's (Episcopal) is a plain edifice with a modern spire, on Church Hill, cor. Broad and 24th Sts. It is of ante-Revolutionary origin, and in it was held (in 1775) the Virginia Convention to decide the action of the colony, on which occasion Patrick Henry exclaimed: \"The war is inevitable, and let it come J Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and sla very? Forbid it, Almighty God ! I know not what course others may take, but, as for me, give me liberty or give me death ! \" St. John's Church was subsequently, in 1788, the scene of the meeting of the convention to determine whether Virginia would ratify the Federal Constitution. The Monnuicntal Church (Episcopal), cor. Broad and 13th Sts., is a handsome edifice, with a dome, standing on the spot for merly occupied by the Richmond Theatre. In 1811, during the performance of a piece called \"The Bleeding Nun,\" the theatre caught fire, and, in the terror and con fusion of the crowd rushing to the doors, 69 persons, including the Governor of Vir ginia and some of the most eminent men and beautiful women of the State, were crushed or burned to death. The church was erected as a memorial of the event, the remains of the victims being interred beneath a mural tablet in the vestibule. Of the more modern structures, St. Paul's (Episcopal), cor. Grace and 9th Sts., is the most imposing. In it Jeft'erson Davis was seated when a messenger brought him the fatal news that Lee was about to evacuate Petersburg. Other important churches are the First Baptist, cor. Broad and 12th Sts. ; the Second Baptist, cor. Main and 6th Sts.; the Trinity Methodist, cor. Broad and 20th Sts.; the Centenary"], [148, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 130 Methodist, cor. Grace and 5th ; the First Presbyterian, cor. 10th and Capitol Sts. ; St. Peter's (Roman Catholic), cor. Grace and 8th Sts.; and St. Pa trick's (Roman Catholic), Church Hill and 25th St. The old African Church is a long, low build ing in Broad St., near Monumental Church, famous as a place of political meet ings before and during the war. Miscellaneous Places of Interest.\u2014 There are several cemeteries in Richmond, the principal of which is Hollywood. This is a spot of great natural beauty, in the W. limits of the city, above James River, and embraces an extensive tract, alternately hill and dale, the whole ornamented with venerable trees, shrubs, and flowers. On the hill at the S. extremity, a monument marks the resting-place of President Mon roe. Other persons of note are buried here, among them General J. E. B. Stuart, com mander of Lee's cavalry. In the soldiers' section are the graves of hundreds of Con federate dead, from the midst of which rises a monumental pyramid of rough stone. The Falls of James River, extending for about 6 m. above the city, are exceedingly picturesque, and well worth a visit. Three bridges across the river connect Rich mond with Spring Hill and Manchester, the latter a pretty village with two fine cotton-mills. The Tredegar Iron-Works, situated on the river, above the Armory, are among the largest in the country. The buildings cover 15 acres of ground. The Gallego Flour-Mills are said to be the largest in the world ; they can turn out 1,500 barrels of flour a day. RICHMOND TO CHARLESTON. ( Via \" Atlantic CoaBt Line.\" Distance, 567 m. Time, about 25 hours.) Crossing James River on a handsome bridge, the trains on this route soon reach Petersburg (22 m.), avenerable old town on the S. bank of the Appomattox River, famous as the scne of the last great struggles during the late civil war. Since the war, Petersburg has prospered, and the marks of the conflict are slowly disappear ing; but the fortifications are still distinctly traceable, and the chief battle-fields, \u2022etc., are easily found. Weldon (86 m.) is a thriving post-village in North Carolina, at the head of steamboat-navigation on Roanoke River. The country along this portion of the route is flat and uninteresting, and the road traverses a considerable portion of the great pine belt which extends from Virginia to Florida. Goldsboro (164 m.) is a prosperous town of 5,000 inhabitants, near the Neuse River, at the head of navigation. Wilmington (248 m.), the largest city of North Carolina, is in the S. E. extremity of the State, upon the Cape Fear River, 20 m. from the sea. It offers few attractions to the traveler in search of the picturesque, though it played a part in the drama of the Revolution, and also of the civil war. Fort Fisher lies below at the mouth of the river. Steamships ply weekly between Wilmington and New York. From Wilmington to Columbia, the country is of the same featureless and monotonous character, the principal stations en route being Florence (352 m.) and Sumter (391 m.). From Camden Junction (404 m.) a branch road, 38 m. long, leads to Camden, the scene of two Revolutionary battles. Columbia (433 m.), the capital of South Carolina, is a beautiful city, situated on the bluffs of the Congaree, a few miles below the charming falls of that river. It was famous for its delight fully-shaded streets, and its wonderful flower-gardens, but the aspect of the city was greatly changed by the unfortunate conflagration which consumed so large a part ot it during its occupation by General Sherman's forces, in 1865. The State Capitol, when completed, will he one of the handsomest public buildings in the United States, and the Insane Asylum is an object of great interest. The view from Ar senal Hill is the most beautiful in this portion of South Carolina. From Columbia to Charleston, the journey will give the traveler some inkling of the lowland feat ures of Southern landscape, though not in its most interesting character, since the country is level, and most of the way is through extensive pine-forests. There are no stations on the route calling for special mention."], [149, "CHARLESTON. 131 CHARLESTON.

From Philadelphia via steamer, leaving Pier 4, every Friday. Time and fare same as from New York. From Baltimore by steamer every five days. Time, 50 hours ; fare, $15.) CHARLESTON, the chief commercial city of South Carolina, is picturesquely situated at the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, in lat. 32\u00b0 45' N., and Ion. 79\u00b0 57' W. The rivers run a parallel course for nearly 6 m., widening as they approach the sea, and thus gradually narrowing the site of the city to a penin sula. The harbor is a large estuary, extending about 7 m. to the Atlantic, with an average width of 2 m. It is landlocked on all sides except an entrance of about a mile in width. The passage to the inner harbor is defended by four fortresses. On the r. at the entrance is Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan's Island, occupying the site of the fort which, on June 28, 1776, beat off the British fleet of Sir Peter Parker. On the L, raised upon a shoal in the harbor and directly covering the channel, is Fort Sum ter, rendered famous by the part which it played in the opening scene of the civil war. Immediately in front of the city, and but 1 m. from it, is Castle Pinckney, Charleston. covering the crest of a mud-shoal, and facing the entrance. A fine view of the city is obtained in entering the harbor from the sea; and, as it is built on low and level land, it seems to rise from the water as we approach, whence it has been called the \"American Venice.\" The corporate limits of Charleston extend from Battery or White Point, on the extreme S. verge of the city, to an arbitrary line on the N. about 3 m. above. Within this area the city is laid out with tolerable regularity, the streets generally crossing each other at right angles. The houses are mostly of brick or wood, and have large open grounds around them. There are few regular blocks or rows of buildings, and no uniformity ; but what is lost in this respect is gained in variety, and with the fine gardens, shade and fruit trees, creepers, vines, the magnolia, the oak, the cedar, and the pride of India, girdling the quaint dwell ing-houses, the effect is highly picturesque. Charleston was settled in 1679 by an English colony under William Sayle, who became the first Governor. It played a conspicuous part in the Revolution, having been the first among the chief places of the South to assert a common cause with and for the colonies. It was thrice assaulted by the British, and only yielded to a six weeks' siege by an overwhelming force, May 12, 1780. It was the leading city. both in the nullification movement during Jackson's administration and in the in cipient stages of Southern secession. Open hostilities in the civil war began at"], [150, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 132 Charleston, with the bombardment of Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861 ; and for the next four years it was one of the chief points of Federal attack, without being lost by the Confederates, however, until Sherman's capture of Columbia on February 17, 1865. During the war many buildings were destroyed, and the towers and steeples of churches riddled with shot and shell. Since its close rapid progress has been made in the work of rebuilding, and Charleston is now more prosperous than ever. The growth of population has been as follows: In 1800 it was 18,711; in 1850, 42,985 ; in 1860, 40,519; and in 1870, 48,956. The commerce of the city is large, the chief exports being cotton (for which it is one of the chief shipping-ports), rice, naval stores, and fertilizers. The manufacture of fertilizers from the valuable beds of marl and phosphate, discovered in 1868, is now one of the principal industries ; but there are also flour and rice mills, bakeries, carriage and wagon factories, and machine-shops. Hotels and Restauranls The leading hotel is the Charleston Hotel ($4 a day), centrally located in Meeting St., between Hayne and Pinc.kney Sts. It is noted for its great stone colonnade and piazza, reaching from pavement to roof. The Mills House, also in Meeting St., is temporarily closed. The Pavilion Hotel, cor. Meeting and Ilasel Sts. (i\u00a33 a day), and the Waverley House ($2.50 a day), in King St. near Ilasel, are unpretentious but comfortable houses. There are few restaurants in Charleston, almost none deserving the name, though there are \" lunch-rooms,\" with bars attached. The best of these are in East Bay St. near Broad, and in King St. near Wentworth. Modes of Conveyance. \u2014 Three lines of horse-cars traverse the city, and afford easy access to the chief points of interest (fare 10c). They pass through the principal streets, from the Exchange and the battery to the upper ends of Rutledge Ave. and Meeting St. Omnibuses are in waiting at the depots and landings on the arrival of trains and steamers, and convey passengers to any portion of the city (fare 50c). Livery-stables are attached to the different hotels, and, though the charges are not uniform, they are usually moderate. Streets and Drives. \u2014 The two principal streets are King and Meeting, which run N. and S., nearly parallel, the whole length of the city, but converge to intersection near the northern limits. King St, contains the leading retail stores, and is the fashionable promenade. The jobbing and wholesale stores are chiefly in Meeting St. ; and the banks, and brokers' and insurance offices, are in Broad St. The Battery is a popular promenade, lying near the water's edge, and commanding an extensive view of the Bay ; it is surrounded by fine private residences. Fine residences are also found in Meeting St. below Broad, in Rutledge St. and Ave., and at the W. end of Wentworth St. The roads leading out of the city along the Ashley and Cooper Rivers are singularly beautiful, and afford interesting drives. They are all richly embowered in loveliest foliage ; pines, oaks, magnolias, myrtles, and jas mines, vying with each other in tropical luxuriance and splendor. There are also fine drives on Sullivan's Island (reached by ferry). Public and Prominent Buildings. \u2014 Several of the most important of these are clus tered at the intersection of Broad and Meeting Sts. On the N. E. corner is the City Hall, an imposing building, entered by a double flight of marble steps, and standing in an open square. The Council-Chamber is handsomely furnished, and con tains some interesting portraits. On the N. W. corner is the Court-House, a substan tial structure of brick, faced so as to resemble stone. On the S. E. corner stands St. Michael's Church, which will be described further on ; and on the S. W. corner is the Guardhouse, or Police Headquarters, a plain brick building, with a colonnade ex extending over the sidewalk in Broad St. The force is semi-military in organization, and is composed about equally of whites and negroes, who drill with Winchester rifles. At the foot of Broad St. stands the Post-Office, a venerable structure, dating from the colonial period, the original material having been brought from England in 1761. It was much battered during the war, but has since been renovated. The new Custom-House, which has been building for several years and is still unfinished, is situated just S. of the Market-wharf, on Cooper River. It is of white marble, in the Roman-Corinthian style, and will be the finest edifice in the city. A noble"], [151, "CHARLESTON. 133 view is obtained from its graceful Corinthian portico. The Charleston Club-House is an elegant building, in Meeting St. between Broad and Tradd, with a pretty gar den in front. It was erected before the war, by the Carolina Club (which was broken up by the war), and is now used by the United States Courts. The Cham ber of Commerce occupies the 2d and 3d floors of a handsome building at the cor. of Broad and East Bay Sts. ; it has a good reading-room and a restaurant for the use of the members. The Academy of Music, cor. King and Market Sts., is one of the finest theatres in the South. It is 60 by 231 ft., aud cost $160,000. Besides the theatre, with accommodations for 1,200 persons, it contains two large halls for concerts, lectures, etc. The Masonic Temple is a large but rather fantastic build ing, at the cor. of King and Wentworth Sts. The old Orphan-House, standing in the midst of spacious grounds, between Calhoun and Vanderhorst Sts., is the most im posing edifice in the city, and one of the most famous institutions of the kind in the country. John C. Fremont, once a candidate for the presidency, and C. C. Mem minger, Confederate Secretary of the Treasury, were educated there. A statue of William Pitt, erected during the Revolution, stands in the centre of the grounds. The College of Charleston, founded in 1788, has spacious buildings, located in the square bounded by George, Green, College, and St. Philip Sts. It has a library ot about 6,000 volumes, and a valuable museum of natural history. The Medical Col lege, cor. Queen and Franklin Sts., and Roper Hospital, cor. Queen and Mazyck Sts., are large and handsome buildings, the latter especially so. On the same square with these two are the City Hospital and the County Jail. The Workhouse, near by, in Magazine St., is a spacious castellated structure in the Norman style. The Charleston- Library, founded in 1748, has a plain but commodious building at the cor. of Broad and Church Sts. It lost heavily in the fire of 1861, but now contains about 20,000 volumes. The South Carolina Society Hall, in Meeting St. near St. Michael's Church, is a substantial structure, with colonnade and portico, and a fine interior. Market 11.11. in Meeting St. near the Bay, is a fine building, in temple form, standing on a high, open basement, having a lofty portico in front, reached by a double flight of stone steps. In rear of this building are the markets, consisting of a row of low sheds supported by brick arches, and extending to East. Bay St. Between 6 and 9 A. m. these markets present one of the most characteris tic sights that the stranger can see in Charleston. Churches. \u2014 There are at least two churches in Charleston that no stranger should fail to visit; \u2014 St. Michael's and St. Philip's \u2014 both Episcopal. St. Michael's is at the S. E. corner of Broad and Meeting Sts. It was built in 1752, it is said from designs from a pupil of Sir Christopher Wren. The tower is considered very tine, and the situation of the church makes the spire a conspicuous object far out at sea. Its chimes are celebrated for their age and sweetness. During the siege of Charleston, in the late war, the spire was a mark for the Federal artillerymen; but, though persistently shelled, it was struck but a few times, and then only with slight injury. The view from the belfry is very fine, embracing the far stretch of sea and shore, the fortresses in the harbor, the shipping, and nearer at hand build ings as ancient as the church itself. St. Philip's, in Church St. near Queen, was the first church establishment in Charleston; but the present structure, although of venerable age, is yet not quite so old as St. Michael's. The view from the steeple is fine ; but there is a keener interest in the graveyard than even in the old church itself, for here lie South Carolina's most illustrious dead. In the portion of the graveyard that lies across the street is the tomb of John C. Calhoun. It consists of a plain granite slab, supported by walls of brick, and for inscription has simply the name of \"Calhoun.\" St. Finbar's Cathedral (Roman Catholic), or rather the ruins of it (for the building was destroyed in the great fire of 1861), is at the cor. of Broad and Friend Sts. It was one of the most elegant edifices in Charleston, and the walls, turrets, and niches, still standing, are highly picturesque. The Citadel Square Baptist Church, cor. Meeting and Henrietta Sts., is a fine building, in the Norman style, with a spire 220 ft. high. The Central Presbyterian, in Meeting St. near Society, has an elegant Corinthian portico with 8 columns. The Unita rian Church, in Archdale St. near Queen, is a fine specimen of the perpendicular 10"], [152, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 134 Gothic style, and has a very rich interior. The new German Lutheran Church, m King St. opposite the Citadel, is a handsome building, in the Gothic style, with lofty and ornate spire. Grace Church (Episcopal), in Wentworth St., is the most fashionable in the city. The old Huguenot Church, cor. Church and Queen Sts., is worthy of a visit, if for no other purpose, to see the quaint and elegant mural entab latures with which its walls are lined. Suburbs.\u2014 Just outside of the city, on the N. boundary, is Magnolia Cemetery (reached by horse-cars). It is embowered in magnolias and live-oaks, is tastefully laid out, and contains some fine monuments, of which the most noteworthy are those to Colonel Wm. Washington, of Revolutionary fame, Hugh Legare, and W. Gilmore Simms, the novelist. In a vault repose the remains of Lieutenant Vanderhost, whose coffin, shrouded with the Union Jack, may he seen through the lattice-door of the tomb.\u2014 Of the old planters' houses that stood along the Ashley, but one remains, and that is abandoned. Drayton Hall is a large brick mansion, standing in the centre of grounds of a park-like character. The rooms are wainscoted from floor to ceiling, the fireplaces are lined with old-fashioned colored tiles, and the mantels are richly carved ; but the building was never entirely finished, for the owner lost the bride for whom it was designed, and since then it has stood in its incompleteness a memorial of his loss. The mansion is now occupied by negroes. Its parlor is a granary, its wainscot is badly marred, and the rare colored tiles of its fireplaces have been in part carried off by predatory hands. A few miles farther up the river are the ruins of the celebrated Middleton Place, once one of the most beautiful plantations in South Carolina. The scenery, the flowers, hedges, and shrubbery, the undergrowth and noble oaks, the ponds and lakes, the picturesque old tombs \u2014 these still remain, but it is melancholy to contemplate that all the ruin which one sees around him was caused by the unsparing hand of war. Visitors frequently make a pilgrimage to the spot in order to gratify their curiosity, and, if reports are true, the house has suffered greatly from their unscrupulous desire for relics. Per haps the most interesting spot in the neighborhood of Charleston is the old Church of St. James on Goose Creek (reached by carriage, or by Northeastern R. R. to Porcher's Station, 15 ra.). It is situated in the very heart of a forest, is approached by a road little better than a bridle-path, and is entirely isolated from' habitations of any sort. The church was built in 1711, and was saved from destruction during the Revolutionary War by the royal arms of England that are emblazoned over the pulpit. The floor is of stone, the pews are square and high, the altar, reading-desk, and pulpit, are so small as to seem like miniatures of ordinary church-fixtures, and on the walls and altar are tablets in memory of the early members of the congrega tion. One dates from 1711 and two from 1717. \u2014 A short distance from the church, on the other side of the main road, is a farm known as the The Oaks, from the magnificent avenue of those trees by which it is approached. The trees are believed to be nearly 200 years old ; they have attained great size, and for nearly J m. form a continuous arch over the broad road. A day or two may be profitably spent in visiting the various points of interest in the harbor : Fort Sumte-r, which is picturesque even in its ruins ; James Island, with its ruined plantations and crumbling fortifications ; Mount Pleasant, once a popular summer resort, but now filled with moss-grown and rotting houses; and Sullivan's Island, which is fast becoming the \" Long Branch \" of South Carolina, and already contains many handsome cottages and some attractive drives. A steam boat plies regularly every hour between the city, Mount Pleasant, and Sullivan's Island, and on the latter is a line of horse-cars. CHARLESTON TO SAVANNAH. ( Via Savannah & Charleston E. R. Distance, 107 m. Time, 1 hrs.) This road runs within a few miles of the Atlantic coast line, though never in sight of the ocean. For miles the rails are laid on piles, passing through marsh and morass, and crossing swift-rushing, dirty streams, dignified by the name of rivers, and baptized with unpronounceable Indian names. There are no towns of impor-"], [153, "SAVANNAH. 135 tance on the line, but the scenery is wild and rich. Extensive pine-forests, lofty cypresses, wreathed in garlands of pendent moss, the bay and the laurel, draped with the vines of the wild-grape and of ivy, and huge oaks that have stood the wear and tear of centuries, line the road on either side. Noble avenues are created by these forest giants, and pendent from their stalwart limbs hang long festoons of moss and vine, dimly veiling the vista beyond. Flowers grow in profusion, and give variety and beauty to the green shades of the leaves and plants. SAVANNAH. (Savannah maybe reached by rail direct from Richmond via Danville, Charlotte. N.

SAVANNAH, the chief city of Georgi River, 18 m. from its mouth. The i founder of the colony of Georgia, who ;ia, is situated on the S. bank of the Savannah site was selected by General Oglethorpe, the > made his first settlement at this point in February, 1733. The city occupies a bold bluff, about 40 ft. high, extending along the river-bank for a mile, and backward, widening as it recedes, about 6 m. The river making a gentle curve around Hutchinson's Island, the water-front of the city is in the shape of an elongated crescent about 2-^ m. in length. The corporate Savanuah. limits extend back on the elevated plateau about U m., the total area of the city being 34. sq. m. In its general plan, Savannah is universally conceded to be one of the handsomest of American cities. Its streets are broad and beautifully shaded, they cross each other at right angles, and at many of the principal crossings are small public squares or parks, from 1| to 3 acres in extent. These parks, 24 in number, located at equal distances through the city, neatly inclosed, laid out in walks, and planted with the evergreen and ornamental trees of the South, are among the most characteristic features of Savannah; and, in the spring and summer months, when they are carpeted with grass, and the trees and shrubbery are in full foliage, afford"], [154, "136 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. delightful shady walks, and playgrounds for the children, while they are not only or namental, but conducive to the general health by the free ventilation which they afford. Upon the large \" trust-lots,\" four of which front on each of these squares (2 on the E. and 2 on the W.), many of the public edifices and palatial private resi dences of the city are built. The residences are mostly surrounded by flower-gardens, which bloom throughout the year ; and among the shrubbery, in which the city is literally embowered, are the orange-tree, the banana, the magnolia, the bay, the laurel, the cape-myrtle, the stately palmetto, the olive, the flowering oleander, and the pomegranate. Savannah was founded, as we have seen, in 1733. In 1776 the British attacked it and were repulsed ; but on December 29, 1778, they reappeared in overwhelming force and took possession of the city. In October, 1779, the combined French and Americans attempted to recapture it, but were unsuccessful, and Count Pulaski fell in the engagement. Savannah received a city charter in 1789. In 1850 it had 15, 312 inhabitants ; in 1860, 22,292 ; and in 1870, 28,235. The chief business of the place is the receipt and shipment of cotton, though the trade in lumber is also con siderable. As a cotton port it ranks second in the United States. It recovered rapidly from the effect of the civil war, and its commerce has since about doubled. The chief manufacturing establishments are planing-mills, founderies, and flouring and grist mills. The great warehouses of the city are located on a narrow street at the toot of the steep bluff; they open below on the level of the piers, and from the uppermost story on the other side upon a sandy area 200 ft. wide and divided by rows of trees. This is called the Bay, and is the great commercial mart of Savannah. The principal business streets and promenades are Bull, Drayton, and Broad Sts. Among the noteworthy public buildings are the new granite Custom-House, which also contains the Post-Office, cor. Bull and Bay Sts.; the City Exchange, in front of which General Sherman reviewed his army, January 7, 1865 ; the Court-House, Tlieatre, State Arsenal, Artillery Armory, and Jail. St. Andrew's Hall and the Chatham Academy are conspicuous buildings. From the tower of the Exchange the best view of the city and neighborhood is to be had. The building on the N. E. cor. of Bull and Bronghton Sts., known as the Masonic Hall, is interesting as the place where the Ordinance of Secession was passed, Jan. 21, 1861. Four years later (Dec. 28, 1864), a meeting of citizens was held in the same apartment to com memorate the triumph of the Union arms. Among the interesting relics of the past history of Savannah are the building in which the Colonial Legislature held its ses sions, in S. Broad St. near Drayton, and the mansion of the Governor of Georgia during the occupation of the city by the British, which stands in Broughton St. The Market presents an animated and characteristic spectacle in the early morning, The Georgia Historical Society has a large and beautiful hall, in which are a fine library and some interesting relics. Of the church edifices the Episcopal Churches of St. John's and Christ's are the most striking. The former is in the Gothic, the latter in the Ionic style. The lofty spire of the Independent Presbyterian Church is much admired. This church is built of Quincy granite, and cost $130,000. Trinity Church stands in Johnson Square, near the spot wThere John Wesley deliv ered his famous sermons. The most attractive place of public resort is Forsyth Park, an inclosure of 30 acres in the S. part of the city. It is shaded by some venerable old trees, is laid out in serpentine walks, and ornamented with evergreen and flowering trees and shrubs. In the centre is a handsome fountain, after the model of that in the Place de la Concorde, Paris. In Johnson or Monument Square, near the centre of the city, is a fine Doric obelisk, erected to the memory of General Greene and Count Pulaski, the corner-stone of which was laid by Lafayette, during his visit in 1825. The Pulaski Monument stands in Chippewa Square, and is one of the most chaste and perfect specimens of monumental architecture in the United States. The steps are plinths of granite ; the shaft is of purest marble, 55 ft. high, and is surmounted by an exquisitely-carved statue of Liberty, holding the national banner. The monu ment appropriately covers the spot where Pulaski fell, during an attack upon the"], [155, "MOBILE. 137 city while it was occupied by the British, in 1779. It was constructed by Launitz, of New York, at a cost of $22,000, gold. Though built upon a sandy plain, Savannah is not without suburban attractions, there being several places in its vicinity whose sylvan character and picturesque beauty are in keeping with the \" Forest City \" itself. Thunderbolt, Isle of Hope, Beaulieu, Montgomery, and White Bluff, are all rural retreats on \"The Salts,\" within short driving-distance of the city, where, in the summer months, bracing sea breezes and salt-water bathing may be enjoyed. The great drive is to Bonaventure Cemetery, which is situated on Warsaw River, a branch of the Savannah, about 4 m. from the city. The scenery of Bonaventure has long been renowned for its Arcadian beauty. A hundred years ago the seat of the Tatnalls, a wealthy English family, the grounds around the mansion were laid out in broad avenues, and planted in native live-oaks. These trees, long since fully grown, stand like massive columns on either side, while their far-reaching branches, interlacing over head like the frilled roof of some vast cathedral, the deep shade of their evergreen foliage shutting out the sky above, and the long, gray moss-drapery depending from the leafy canopy, silent and still, or gently swaying in the breeze, give to the scene a weird and strangely sombre aspect, at once picturesque and solemn. A more beautiful or more appropriate home for the dead than in the shades of these green forest-aisles cannot well be imagined. Thunderbolt, the favorite summer-resort, is on the Warsaw River, 1 m. beyond Bonaventure. According to local tradition, this place received its name from the fall of a thunderbolt. A spring of water which issued from the spot upon that event has continued to flow ever since. Jas per Spring, 24; m. W. of the city, is the scene of the famous Revolutionary exploit of Sergeant Jasper, who, with only one companion, successfully assailed a British guard of eight men and released a party of American prisoners. SAVANNAH TO MOBILE. ( Via Georgia Central, Atlanta & West Point, Western, and Mobile & Montgomery Railways. Distance, 654 m. There'are no through-trains, and the traveler will have to consult local time-tables.) This route passes through the most productive and thickly-settled districts of Georgia and Alabama, and will enable the traveler to see many of the most charac teristic aspects of Southern inland scenery, which, if not strikingly picturesque, is generally pleasing. Numerous towns, some of them very pretty, cluster along the line, but there are only two or three of sufficient importance to require special mention. Maeon (190 m.), one of the most prosperous and populous cities of Georgia, is prettily situated on the Ocmulgee River. It contains upward of 10,000 inhabitants, is the site of several important iron-founderies, machine-shops, and flour-mills, is regu larly laid out and well built, and, like Savannah, is embowered in trees and shrub bery. Atlanta (293 m.) is the capital of Georgia, and, next to Savannah, the largest and most important city in the State. It is the outgrowth of the railroad-system centring there, and is rather Northern than Southern in character. It is pictu resquely situated upon hilly ground, and has some fine scenery in its neighborhood, but possesses little to interest the tourist. The principal buildings are the State- House (from the cupola of which a fine view is obtained), the City-Hall, the Kim ball House, and the Union Passenger Depot. Montgomery (468 ra.) is the capital of Alabama, and the second city of the State in size and commercial importance. It is situated on the Alabama River, was founded in 1817, had 10,588 inhabitants in 1870, and has a sort of fame as the first capital of the Confederate States. The only noteworthy building is the State-House, which, though small, is an imposing structure. It is situated on Capitol Hill, and from its dome an extended view is obtained.

MOBILE, the largest city and only seaport of Alabama, is situated on the W. side of the Mobile River, immediately above its entrance into Mobile Bay, 30 m. from the Gulf of Mexico, in lat. 30\u00b0 42' N. and Ion. 88\u00b0 W. Its site is a sandy plain, rising as it recedes from the river, and bounded, at the distance of a few miles, by high and beautiful hills. The corporate limits of the city extend 6 m. N. and S. and 2 or 3 m. W. from the river. The thickly-inhabited part extends for about a mile along the river, and nearly the same distance back toward the hills. It is laid out with considerable regularity, and the streets are generally well paved and delightfully shaded. Six lines of horse-cars traverse the city, and a water-supply, of unusual purity and excellence, is brought froj^' Spring Hillr 6 m. distant. On Mobile Point, a short distance below the city, is alighthouse^ne lan tern of which is 55 ft. above the sea-level. Fort Morgan (formerly Fort^owyer), and Fort Gain.es, a formidable fortress, opposite Dauphin Island, command the entrance to the harbor. Spanish Fort and Fort Blakely, imd0aj#eries Gladden, Tracy, Mclnlosh and Huger, are passed on the Tensas River^rom Mobile to Pol lard and Montgomery. Large numbers of sailing-vessels ply between Mobile and New Orleans, the ports on the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic coast. A daihj* line of steamers runs to New Orleans by way of lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain ; also up the Alabama River to Montgomery and other points. Mobile was the original seat of French colonization in the Southwest, and fop*' many years the capital of the colony of Louisiana. Historians differ as to the pre cise date of the foundation, though it is known that a settlement was made a little above the present site of the city at least as early as 1702. Many of the first set tlers were Canadians. In 1723 the seat of the colonial government was transferred to New Orleans. In 1763, Mobile, with all that portion of Louisiana lying E. of the Mississippi and N. of Bayou Iberville, Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain, passed into the possession of Great Britain. In 1780 England surrendered it to Spain, and that Government made it over to the United States in 1813. It was incorporated as a city in 1 81 9, the population being then about 800. Mobile was one of the last points in the Confederacy occupied by the Union forces during the late war, and was not finally reduced until April 11, 1865, three days after the surrender of General Lee. On August 5, 1864, the harbor fortifications were attacked by Admiral Farragut, who ran his fleet past the forts, destroyed the Confederate fleet, including the ram Tennessee, reduced the forts, and closed the harbor against blockade-runners, though he failed to capture the city itself. The trade of Mobile is much hindered by the shallowness of its harbor. Vessels drawing more than 8 or 10 ft. are obliged to an chor in the bay, 25 m. or more from the city; but improvements are now in prog ress which it is hoped will enable vessels of 13 ft. of water to reach the wharves. The chief business is the receipt and shipment of cotton, of which from 325,000 to 350,000 bales are dispatched annually. The manufactures include carriages and furniture, paper, founderies and machine shops, and a brewery. Government Street is the finest avenue and favorite promenade of the city. It is shaded by superb oak-trees, and is bordered by fine residences surrounded by luxuriant gardens. The Public Square, between Dauphin and St. Francis Sts., is also a place of much resort. It is adorned with live-oaks and other shade-trees. The Custom-House, which also contains the Post- Office, at the cor. of Royal and St. Fran cis Sts., is the finest, largest, and most costly public edifice in the city. It is built of granite, and cost $250,000. The Theatre and the Market-House, with rooms in the upper story for the municipal officers, are in Royal St. The Battle House presents an imposing facade of painted brick, immediately opposite the Custom-House. Odd- Fellows' Hall, in Royal St., and Temperance Hall, cor. St. Michael and St. Joseph Sts., are conspicuous buildings. Adjoining Odd-Fellows' Hall is the Bank of Mobile, with a stately colonnade and portico. Barton Academy, in Royal St., is a large and handsome building surmounted by a dome. Of the church edifices the most notable are the Cathedral of the Immaculate Concrption (Roman Catholic), in Olaiborne St. between Dauphin and Conti ; Christ Church (Episcopal), cor. Church and St. Emannel Sts.; Trinity (Episcopal) with massive campanile and belfry; and the First Presbyterian, cor. Government and Jackson Sts.

Spring Hill is a pleasant suburban retreat 6 miles west of the city (reached by the St. Francis St. cars). The College of St. Joseph, a Jesuit institution, is located here. It was founded in 1832 by Bishop Portier, and has a fine building 375 ft. long surmounted by a tower from which noble views may be obtained. The college has a library of 8,000 volumes and a valuable collection of scientific apparatus. A statue of the Virgin Mary brought from Toulouse, France, stands in rear of the building.

Time, 7 hrs.) \"Nothing in lowland scenery,\" says Mr. Edward King, in his \"Great South,' \"could be more picturesque than that afforded by the ride from New Orleans to Mobile, over the Mobile & Texas Railroad, which stretches along the Gulf line of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. It runs through Savannahs and brakes, skirts the borders of grand forests, offers here a glimpse of a lake and there a peep at the blue waters of the noble Gulf; now clambers over miles of trestle-work, as at Bay St. Louis, Biloxi (the old fortress of Bienville's time) and Paseagoula ; and now plunges into the very heart of pine-woods, where the foresters are busily building little towns and felling giant trees, and where the revivifying aroma of the forest is mingled with the fresh breezes from the sea.\" NEW ORLEANS.

The older portion of the city is bnilt within a great bend of the river, from which circumstance it derives its familiar sobriquet, of the \" Crescent City.\" In the progress of its growth up-stream, it has now so extended itself as to follow long curves in opposite directions, so that the river-front on the 1. bank presents an outline somewhat resembling the letter S. The statutory limits of the city embrace an area of nearly 150 sq. m., but the actual city covers an area of about 41 sq. m. It is built on land gently descending from the river toward a marshy tract in the rear, and from 2 to 4 ft. below the level of the river at high-water mark, which is prevented from overflowing by a vast embankment of earth, called the Levee. This levee is 15 ft. wide and 4 ft. high, is constructed for a great distance along the river-bank, and forms a delightful promenade during the fall and winter months. The site of New Orleans was surveyed in 1717 by De la Tour; it was settled in 1718, but abandoned in consequence of overflows, storms, and sickness; was reset tled in 1723, held by the French til! 1729, then by the Spanish till 1801, and by the French again till 1803, when, with the province of Louisiana, it was ceded to the United States. It was incorporated as a city in 1804, and in 1868 was made the capital of the State. The most memorable events in the history of New Orleans are the battle of Jan. 8, 1815, in which the British were defeated by Andrew Jack son, and the capture of the city by Admiral Farragut on April 24, 1862. In 1810, t"], [158, "140 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. seven years after its cession to the United States, the population of New Orleans was 17,243. In 1850 it had increased to 116,375 ; in 1860, to 168,675 ; and in 1870, to 191,418. In 1875 local authorities estimated it at about 210,000.\u2014 In the value of its exports and its entire foreign commerce New Orleans ranks next to New York. though several ports surpass it in the value of imports. Not unfrequently from 1,000 to 1,500 steamers and flat-boats may be seen lying at the Levee; and, except in the summer months, its wharves are thronged with hundreds of ships and sailing- New Orleans. craft from all quarters of the globe. New Orleans is the chief cotton-mart of the word ; and, besides cotton, it sends abroad sugar, tobacco, flour, pork, etc., to the tota value in 1874 of $93,715,710. 'Its imports of coffee, sugar, salt, iron dry- goods, liquors, etc., amounted in 1874 to $14,533,804. The manufactures of the city are not extensive. Hotels, Restaurants, and finks.\u2014 The St. Charles Hotel, bounded by St Charles (xravier, and Common Sts., is one of the institutions of New Orleans, and one of the largest and finest hotels in the United States ($5 a day). The St. Louis is located in Ot. Louis St. between Royal and Ohartres, in the French quarter. It once held the same high rank as the St. Charles, but since 1874 it has been used as a State-House. the old dimng-hall is one of the most beautiful in the country, and the great inner circle of the dome is richly frescoed with allegorical scenes and busts of emi- nent Americans.

Ferries connect the city with Algiers, Maedonough, and Gretna, on the E. side of the river. Streets and Drives. \u2014 The streets of New Orleans, in width and general appearance, are second to those of no city of its size. As far back as Claiborne St. those running parallel to the river and to each other present an unbroken line from the lower to the upper limits of the city, a distance of about 12 m. Those at right angles to them run from the Mississippi toward the lake with more regularity than might be expected from the very sinuous course of the river. Many of the streets are well paved and some are shelled ; but many are unpaved and consequently scarcely usable in wet weather, while in dry weather they are intolerably dusty. Some of the finest streets of the city are in this condition. Canal St. is the main business thoroughfare and promenade, and contains many fine stores and private residences. It is nearly 200 ft. wide, and has a grass-plot 25 ft. wide and bordered with two rows of trees, extending in the centre through its whole length. Claiborne, Rampart, St. Charles, and Esplanade Sts., are similarly embellished. Royal, Rampart, and Es- planade Sts., are the principal prome nades of the French quarter. \u2014 The favor ite drive is out the Shell Road to Lake Pontchartrain, past the celebrated Me tairie race-track. It presents a highly animated spectacle on Sunday after noons. Public and Promi nent Buildings. \u2014 New Orleans is not rich in architecture, but there are a few im- Canal Street. posing buildings. Chief among these is the Custom-House, which, next to the Capitol at Washington, is the largest building in the United States. This noble structure is built of Quincy granite brought from the Massachusetts quarries. Its main front on Canal St. is 334 ft.; that on Custom-House St., 252 ft.; on the new Levee, 310 ft., and on the old Levee, 297 ft. Its height is 82 ft. The Long Room, or chief business apartment, is 116 by 90 ft., and is lighted by 50 windows. The building was begun in 1848, and is not yet entirely finished. The Post-Otfice occupies the basement of the Custom-Honse, and is one of the most elegant and commodious in the country. The XT. S. Branch Mint stands at the cor. of Espla nade and New Levee Sts. It is built of brick, stuccoed in imitation of brown-stone, in the Ionic style, and, being 28*2 ft. long, 180 ft. deep, and three stories high, presents an imposing appearance. No coining has been done there since the war, but Con gress has taken steps to recommence operations. The window, under the front portico of the main building, from which Mnmford was hung by order of General Butler, June 7, 18C2. is stirTpoiuted out. The City Hall, at the intersection of St."], [160, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 142 Charles and Lafayette Sts., is the most artistic of the public buildings of the city. It is of white marble, in the Ionic style, with a wide and high flight of granite steps _ leading to an ele- gant portico sup- ported by eight col- umns. The State | and City Libraries j occupy suitable rooms in this build- ing. The Court- Houses are on the r. and 1. of the Ca- thedral, in Jackson Square. They were constructed toward j the close of the last I century, through I the liberality of the founder of the Ca- thedral, Don Andre Almonaster, and United States Mint are conspicuous for their quaint style of architecture, which is Tusco-Doric. The City Prisons, which comprise a county jail and a police jail, are in Orleans and Ann Sts., opposite the Market-Place. They are of brick plastered to imitate granite, and three stories high. The Merchants'1 Exchange, a handsome marble structure in Royal St. near Canal, was formerly a place of great resort, but since the removal of the Post-Office to the Custom-House its glory has departed, and it exists now in little more than name. Masonic Hall, cor. St. Charles and Perdido Sts., is an imposing edifice, 103 by 100 ft. Odd-Fellows'1 Hall is a massive square structure at the cor. of Camp and Lafayette Sts., facing Lafayette Square. It is of brick, stuccoed and painted white, four stories high, and cost $210,000. On the second floor is the finest concert-hall in the South. Exposition Hall is a spacious building in St. Charles St., between Julia and Girod, in which are given floral displays and other exhibitions. The St. Charles and St. Louis Hotels, which are among the largest and finest edifices in the city, have already been men tioned. The former has a spacious balcony and portico, lofty and handsome Corin thian pillars, and a large and tasteful rotunda. The Mechanics'1 Lnstitute, in Dryades St. near Canal, is among the finest buildings in the city. The Pontalba Buildings are immense brick structures occupying the E. and W. sides of Jackson Square. Theatres and Places of Amusement. \u2014 The French Opera-House, cor. Bourbon and Toulouse Sts., is a well-arranged building of modern construction. It has seats for 2,000, and is fitted up in the style of the Theatre Framjais, Paris. The Academy of Music, in St. Charles St., between Perdido and Commercial Sts., is the usual place for star performances. The St. Charles Theatre, in St. Charles St., between Per dido and Poydras, is handsomely appointed, and has a good company. The Nation al (or Globe) Theatre is at the cor. of Perdido andBaronne Sts. ; and the Varieties Theatre, in Canal St. Besides the theatres, there are a score or more of halls in which entertainments of various kinds are given. The principal of these are the Masonic Hall, Odd-Fellows' Hall, and Exposition Hall, previously mentioned ; St. Patrick's Hall, in Camp St., opposite Lafayette Square; and Griinewald Hall, in Baronne St., near Canal. Horse-races occur at Metairie Race-course and Oakland Race-course (both reached by Shell Road). Churches. \u2014 The most famous church edifice in New Orleans is the old Cathedral of St. Lonis (Roman Catholic), which stands in Chartres St., on the E. side of Jackson Square. It has an imposing faijade surmounted by a lofty steeple and flanked by two towers, each surmounted by a smaller steeple. The foundation was laid in 1792, and the building completed in 1794, by Don Andre Almonaster, perpetual regidor of the province, ft was altered and enlarged in 1850, from designs by De"], [161, "NEW ORLEANS. 143 Louilly. The paintings on the roof of the building are by Canova and Rossi. The Church of the Immaculate Conception (Jesuit), cor. Baronne and Common Sts., is a striking edifice in the Moorish style of architecture. High mass, both here and at the Cathedral, at 10 o'clock every Sunday. St. Patrick's (Roman Catholic) is a fine Gothic structure in Camp St., N. of Lafayette Square. Its tower, 190 ft. high, was modeled after that of the famous minster at York, England. The church of St. John the Baptist, in Dryades St., between Clio and Calliope, which was opened in 1872, is a very elegant, building. The most fashionable Episcopal churches are Trinity, cor. Jackson and Coliseum Sts., and St. Paul's, cor. Camp and Gaiennie Sts. The latter is a handsome specimen of the Gothic style, and has a rich interior. Annunciation Church, overlooking Annunciation Square, is a fine edifice. The oldest of the Epis copal organizations, dating back to 1806, is Christ Church, cor. Canal and Rampart Sts. The First Presbyterian, fronting on Lafayette Square, is a fine structure in the Greco-Doric style, much admired for its elegant steeple. The McGhee Church, in Carondelet St., near Lafayette, is the principal of the Methodist Episcopal churches South. The Unitarian Church, cor. St. Charles and Julia Sts., is a handsome build ing. The Temple Sinai (Jewish synagogue), in Carondelet St., near Calliope, is one of the finest places of worship in the city. Party-colored bricks and pointing give its walls a light, airy appearance, and it has a handsome portico, flanked by two towers capped with tinted cupolas. The Gothic windows are filled with beautifully stained glass. St. Antoine's Chapel, cor. Rampart and Conti Sts., is generally known as the \"Mortuary Chapel,\" all funeral ceremonies of resident Catholics being per formed here. One of the most interesting relics of the early church history of New Orleans is the old Ursuline Convent, in Cond6 St. This quaint and venerable build ing was erected in 1787, during the reign of Carlos III., by Don Andre Almonaster. It is now occupied by the bishop, and is known as the \"Bishop's Palace.\" Educational and Charitable Institutions.\u2014 The University of Louisiana is in Common St., near Baronne, and occupies the entire front of the block. Only two depart ments, law and medicine, have been organized, but these are of a very high order, and are largely attended. The Medical College, which stands in the centre of the block, has a facade of 100 ft. It contains a large anatomical museum, and extensive and valuable collections of many kinds. Straight University is exclusively for col ored students, ami gives instruction of good grammar-school grade. Thero are 80 public schools, and numerous private ones, mostly Roman Catholic. The Charity Hospital, in Common St., between St. Mary's and Gironde, is one ot the noblest buildings in the city, and one of the most famous institutions of the kind in the country. It was founded in 1784, has stood on its present site since 1832, and has accommodations for 500 patients. The Hotel Dieu, I m. farther back from the river, is a very fine hospital established by the Sisters of Charity, and supported entirely by receipts from patients, some of whom are, nevertheless, beneficiary. It occupies a full square, and is surrounded by a well-kept garden of shrubbery and flowers. The Maison de- Sante, cor. Canal and Claiborne Sts., long one of the most noted infirmaries of New Orleans, is now deserted, and, like the U. S. Marine Hos pital (cor. Common and Broad Sts.), which has not been used since 1860, is rapidly falling into decay. Other prominent charitable institutions are the Poydras Female Orphan Asylum, in Magazine. St., the St. Anna's Widows' Asylum, the St. Vincent Orphan Asylum, the Indigent Colored Orphan Asylum, and the German Protestant Asylum. The ruins of the Touro Almshouse, burned during the war by colored troops, who had used it for barracks, occupy a prominent locale on the Levee at the S. end of the city. . .. Pnblic Sqnarcs and Cemeteries.\u2014 There are 10 public squares in the city, most ot them inclosed with iron railings, but some barely more than in embryo. The largest of these inclosures is the City Park, near the N. E. boundary (reached by- Canal St. and Ridge Road cars). It embraces 150 acres, tastefully laid out, but is little frequented. Jackson Sqnare (formerly known as the Place d'Armes), covering the centre of the river-front of the old Town Plot, now First District, is the favorite resort It is adorned with beautiful trees and shrubbery, and shell-strewn paths, and in the centre stands Mills's equestrian statue of General Jackson. The imposing"], [162, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 144 fronts of the cathedral and courts of justice are seen to great advantage from the river-entrance to the square. Lafayette Square, in the Second District, bounded by St. Charles and Camp Sts., is another handsome inclosure.. The fine marble front of the City Hall, the tapering spire of the Presbyterian Church, and the massive fa cade of Odd-Fellows' Hall, present a striking appearance. In the square is a fine white-marble statue of Franklin, by Hiram Powers. In Canal St., between St. Charles and Royal, is a colossal bronze statue of Henry Clay, by Hart. Douglas Square is beautifully laid out and well kept. Annunciation Square and Tivoli Circle, at the head of St. Charles St., are worth a visit. There are some handsome private residences in the neighborhood of the former. The Cemeteries of New Orleans are- noteworthy for their unique arrangement and peculiar modes of interment. From the nature of the soil, which is semi-fluid at a depth of 2 or 3 ft. below the surface, all the tombs are aboveground. Some of these are 'very costly and beautiful structures, of marble, iron, etc.; but the great majority consist of cells, placed one above another, generally to the height of 7 or 8 ft. Each cell is only large enough to receive the coffin, and is hermetically bricked up at its narrow entrance as soon as the funeral rites are over. In most instances a marble tablet, appropriately inscribed, is placed over the brickwork by which the vault (or \" oven,\" as it is called here) is closed. There are 33 cemeteries in and near the city ; of these the Cypress Grove and Greenwood, on the Metairie Ridge, at the N. end of Canal St., are best worth visiting. St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, at the cor. of Basin and St. Louis Sts., contains some fine monuments, of which the more noteworthy are the vaults of the \" Societe Franeaise de Bienfaisance,\" \" Orleans Battalion of Artillery,\" and '' Italian Benevolent Society.\" The last is ot white marble, and is one of the most beautiful structures of its kind in the country. The Markets and the Levee. \u2014 The great \"sight\" of New Orleans, and perhaps the most picturesque to be seen in America, is the French Market, which comprises several buildings on the Levee, near Jackson Square. The best time to visit it is between 8 and 9 o'clock on Sunday morning, or at 6 a. m. on other days. At break of day the gathering commences, and it would seem as if all nations and tongues were represented in the motley crowd which surges in and out until near 10 o'clock. The noise, far from being unpleasant, however, is musical to the stranger's ears; and nowhere else will he find such an infinite variety of articles exposed for sale. Fruits are especially abundant and various, embracing all the products of both temperate and tropical regions, and the flowers are wonderful to behold. French is the prevailing language, and it will be heard in every variety, from the silvery elegance of the polished Creole to the childish jargon of the negroes. The Levee affords the visitor one of the most striking and characteristic sights of the Crescent. City. For extent and activity it has no equal on the continent. The best points from which to obtain a view of the city and its environs are the roof of the St. Charles Hotel and the tower of St. Patrick's Church. Suburbs. \u2014 The Battle-field, the scene of General Jackson's great victory over the British, Jan. 8, 1815, is the most interesting spot in the vicinity of New Orleans. It. lies 44; m. S. of Canal St., and may be reached either by carriage along the Levee or by horse-cars. It is washed by the waters of the Mississippi, and surrounded by cypress-swamps and canebrakes. A marble monument, 70 ft. high and yet unfin ished, occupies a suitable site overlooking the ground, and serves to commemorate the victory. A National Cemetery occupies the S. W. corner of the field. Between the Battle-field and the city the Ursuline Convent, an imposing building, 200 ft. long, overlooks the river. A nunnery and chapel are attached to the convent. Lake Pontchartrain, 5 m. N. of the city, is famous for its fish and game. It is 40 m. long and 24 m. wide, and from 16 to 20 ft. deep. It is reached by the Lake Railway every hour, or by drive on the Shell Road. The swamps which lie be tween \"the city and the lake are covered with a thick growth of cypress and other trees peculiar to this locality. Carrollton, in the northern suburbs, has many fine public gardens and private residences. Algiers, opposite New Orleans, has exten sive dry-docks and ship-yards. Communication by ferry. Gretna, on the same side, is a pretty rural spot, abounding in pleasant, shady walks."], [163, "MONTREAL 145 MONTREAL.

MONTREAL, the largest city and commercial metropolis of British North America, is situated on an island of the same name, at the confluence ot the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers, in lat, 45\u00b0 31' N. and Ion. 73\u00b0 35' W. It de rives its name from Mont Real, or Mount Royal, which rises 750 ft. above the river, and closes the city in on that side. Including its suburbs, Montreal stretches along the river for 2 m., from S. E. to N. W., and for some distance extends from one to two miles inland. The houses are built mostly of a grayish limestone from adja cent quarries, and with its tall spires and glittering roofs and domes, and the beau tiful villas that stud its lofty background, the city presents as picturesque a pano rama as is to be seen on the entire continent. The quays of Montreal are built of View of Montreal from Mount Royal. solid limestone, and, uniting with the locks and cut-stone wharves of the Lachine Canal, they present for several miles a display of continuous masonry which has few parallels. Unlike the levees of the Ohio and Mississippi, no unsightly ware houses disfigure the river-side. A broad stone esplanade, or terrace, the parapets of which are surmounted with a substantial iron railing, forms the river-front. St. Paul St., the chief commercial thoroughfare, extends along the river the whole length of the city. Other important business streets are St. James, Me Gill, Notre- Dame, and Commissioner Sts. The fashionable promenades are Great St. Janus and Notre-Dame- Sts. The finest private, residences are in the suburbs, toward Mount Royal. , , The settlement of Montreal dates from 1535, when it was visited by Jacques Carrier, who named its mountain. In 1542 the first European settlers arrived, and just one centurv later the original Indian name (\" Hochelaga\") gave place to the French one of \"Yille Marie,\" which in time was replaced by the present one, when the city came into British possession in 1761. At the latter date, Montreal was"], [164, "146 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. well peopled and strongly fortified ; nevertheless it was captured by the Americans under General Montgomery, in November, 1775, and held by them until the follow ing summer. In 1779, Montreal contained about 7,000 inhabitants. In 1861 the population had increased to 90,323, and in 1871 to 107,225. The commerce of Montreal is very large, as, though it is 600 m. from the sea, its advantageous position at the head of ship-navigation on the St. Lawrence, and at the foot of the great chain of improved inland waters extending from the Lachine Canal to the western shores of Lake Superior, has made it the chief shipping-port of the Dominion of Canada. In 1873, its imports were valued at $44,320,646, and its exports at $19, 679,118. The manufactures are various and important, the principal being axes and saws, steam-engines, printing-types, India-rubber shoes, paper, furniture, wool ens, cordage, and flour. Hotels : The St. Lawrence Hall, a spacious and handsome house in Great St. James St.; the Ottawa House, cor. St. James and Notre-Dame Sts. ; the Donnegana House, in Notre-Dame St.; the Montreal House, on Custom-House Square, opposite the Custom-House; and the Albion Hotel, in McGill St. Besides these there are numerous cafes and lodging-bouses on a smaller scale. Modes of Conveyance. \u2014 Horse-cars traverse the city in all directions, and afford an easy access to any desired point. Carriages wait at the depot and steamboat-land ings, and at various stands in the city. Their charges are: One-horse carriage for 1 or 2 persons, 25c. a course within the city limits, or 50c. an hour ; for 3 or 4 per sons, 40c. a course, 75c. an hour. Two-horse carriage, for 1 or 2 persons, 40c. a course, 75c. an hour ; for 3 or 4 persons, 50c. a course, $1 an hour. Public and Prominent Buildings. \u2014 The most imposing public building in the city is the Bonseconrs Market, a fine stone edifice in the Doric style, fronting on the river at the cor. of St. Paul and Water Sts. It is three stories high, and is surmounted by a dome, the view from which is extremely fine. In one of the upper stories are the city council-chamber and the offices of the Corporation, and a concert or ball room capable of accommodating 4,000 people. The Custom-House, on the site of an old market-place between St. Paul St. and the river, is a spacious and massive structure, with a fine tower. The Post- Office is a beautiful cut-stone edifice in Great St. James St., near the Place d'Armes. The Court-House, in Notre-Dame St., is a large and elegant building in the Ionic style, 300 by 125 ft., and erected at a cost of $300,000. It contains a law library of 6,000 volumes. Back of it is the Champj de Mars, a fine military parade-ground. The Merchants' Exchange is a handsome structure, in the modern Italian style, in St. Sacrament St. It contains a large and comfortable read ing-room, well supplied with English and American newspapers and periodicals, all at the service of the stranger when properly introduced. The handsome buildings of the Bank of Montreal and the City Bank stand side by side on the Place d'Armes. The first is a fine example of the Corinthian style. Fronting on the same square are the Masonic Hall, the home of the Grand Lodge of Masons of Canada, and the ele gant Ontario Bank. Fronting on Victoria Square, at the intersection of St. James and McGill Sts., is the fine building of the Young Men's Christian Association. The Crystal Palace is a large building of small architectural pretensions, in St. Cath erine St. near University, in which are exhibited the industrial products of the dif ferent provinces. Mechanics' Institute, in Great St. James St., is an elegant struct ure in the Italian style, with an elaborately-decorated lecture-room. Churches. \u2014 No American city equals Montreal in the size and magnificence of its church-edifices. The Roman Catholic, cathedral of Notre-Dame, fronting on the Place d'Armes, is the largest on the continent, being 241 ft. long and 135 ft. wide, and capable of seating from 10,000 to 12,000 persons. It is of stone, in the Gothic style, and has six towers, one at each corner and one in the middle of each flank. The two on the main front are 213 ft. high, and in one of them is a fine chime of bells, the largest of which (the \" Gros Bourdon \") weighs 29,400 pounds. The view from the tower, which is generally open to visitors, is very extensive. Even this huge structure will be surpassed in size by the new cathedral (Roman Catholic) now in course of erection at the cor. of Dorchester and Cemetery Sts., after the plan of St. Peter's, at Rome. Christ Church Cathedral (Episcopal), in St. Catherine St., is the"], [165, "MONTREAL 147 most perfect specimen of English-Gothic architecture in America. It'is cruciform, built of rough Montreal stone with Caen-stone facings, and is surmounted by a spier -224 ft. high. The interior decorations are extremely rich. The Bishop's Church (Roman Catholic), in St. Denis St., is a very elegant structure in the pointed Gothic style, known as the St. James. St. Patrick's Church. (Roman Catholic) occupies a commanding position at the W. end of Lagauchetiere St. It has seats for 5,000 per sons, and its handsome Gothic windows are filled with stained glass. The Church of the Cesn (Jesuit), in Bleury St., has the finest interior in the city. The vast nave (75 ft. high) is bordered by rich composite columns, and both walls and ceiling are beautifully painted and frescoed. Other important Roman Catholic churches are the Recollect, in Notre-Dame St., the Bonsecours, near the great market, and St. Mary's, in Griffintown. There are also chapels attached to all the nunneries, in some of which excellent pictures may be seen. Besides Christ Church Cathedral, the principal Episcopal churches are Trinity, a fine stone edifice in the early Eng lish-Gothic style, in St. Paul St. ; St. George's, in St. Joseph St. ; St. Thomas's, in St. Mary's St. ; and St. Stephen's, in Griffintown. St. Andrew's Church (Presbyterian), in Radegonde St., is a beautiful specimen of Gothic architecture, being a close imita tion of Salisbury Cathedral, though of course on a greatly reduced scale. Near by is the Church of the Messiah (Unitarian), a lofty and spacious building. Zion Church (Independent), in Radegonde St., near Victoria Square, was the scene of the sad riot and loss of life on the occasion of Gavazzi's lecture in 1852. The Wesleyan Method- ist, in Dorchester St., is a graceful building in the English-Gothic style ; and the same denomination have a large and handsome building in St. James St., and others in Griffintown. Educational and Charitable Institutions, Nnnneries, etc. \u2014 First among the educational institutions is the university, or McGill College, which is beautifully situated at the base of Mount Royal, overlooking the city. The museum of this college is one of the finest in the country. The Museum of the Natural History Society, another valuable col lection, is near the Crystal Palace (admission, 25c). The Geological Museum is in a large building fronting on the Champ de Mars. A short distance W. of McGill College, in Sherbrooke St., is the large and stately building of the ecclesiastical Seminary of St. Sulpice, for the education of Catholic priests. Another Seminary of St. Sulpice (founded in 1657), adjoining the cathedral of Notre-Dame, is 132 ft. long by 29 deep, and is surrounded by spacious gardens and court-yards. The Do minion Military School is an immense building fronting on the Champ de Mars. The Asylum for the Blind, in St. Catherine St., near St. George, has a fine chapel in the Romanesque style with richly-frescoed interior. The Hotel Dien, founded in 1644 for the cure of the sick, is a vast and imposing building just outside the city limits (reached by Main St.). St. Patrick's Hospital, in Dorchester St., at the W. end of the town, is another spacious structure. Both of these establishments are under the charge of the Sisters of St. Joseph. There are numerous other benevolent institu tions in the city not calling for special mention. The Gray Nunnery (founded in 1692 for the care of lunatics and children) is a vast cruciform building in Dorchester St. The Black, or Congregational Nunnery, in Notre-Dame St. near the Place d'Armes, dates from 1659, and is devoted to the education of young persons of the female sex. At Longue Pointe, a short distance from Montreal, is the great Convent of the Holy Name of Mary. The stranger de sirous of visiting either of the nunneries should apply to the Lady Superior for ad mission, which is seldom refused. Miscellaneous Places of Interest. \u2014 \" The lion par excellence of Montreal, the eighth wonder of the world,\" as it has been called, is the Victoria Bridge, which spans the St. Lawrence, connecting the city on the island with she mainland to the S. Its length is 9,194 ft., or nearly 2 in. It rests, in this, splendid transit, upon 23 piers and 2 abutments of solid masonry, the central span being 330 ft. long. The massive iron tube through which the railway -track is laid is 22 ft. high and 16 ft. wide. The total cost of the bridge was $6,300,000. It was formally opened with great pomp and ceremony by the Prince of Wales, during his visit to America in the sum mer of 1860. The view of Montreal from the bridge should not be missed. The"], [166, "BAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 148 Water - Works, a mile or so above the city, are extremely interesting for their own sake, and for the delightful scenery in the vicinity. The old Government-House, in Jacques Carrier Square, and the Nelson Monument near by, are objects of interest, though the monument is in a rather dilapidated condition. The Mount Royal Cemetery is 2 m. from the city, on the N. slope of the mountain. From the high road round its base, a broad avenue gradually ascends to this pleasant spot. The best views of Montreal and its neighborhood are obtained by taking the famous drive \" Around the Mountain,\" 9 m. long. No visitor to Montreal should fail to see the Lachine Kapids. They may be reached by carriage, hut the most advantageous way of seeing them is to take the 7 a. m. train (from Bonaventure station) to La chine, get on the steamer there, and return through the Rapids to Montreal, arriv ing at 9 a. m. The \"ice-shove,\" a most imposing spectacle, may be witnessed by those travel ers who arrive at Montreal toward the beginning of April. This strange phenome non results from the crowding of the ice about a mile below the city, where the channel of the river is comparatively narrow ; there it is packed, piled, and frozen into a solid mass of twenty to thirty feet in thickness, which, when lifted by the rising waters above, and set in motion again by the whole hydraulic power of the gigantic stream, rushes onward until again impeded by the banks of the narrowing river. The lateral pressure it there exerts forces the bordage up on the land, where it not unfrequently accumulates to the height of 50 feet. QUEBEC. is reached from Montreal via Grand Trunk Railway. Distance. 178 m. ; time, 8 hrs. Also via steamer on the St. Lawrence River. Distance, 263 m. Fare, first class, including stateroom and meals, $3 ; second class, without meals, $1. The steamer is much preferable in summer, as it en- ables the traveler to see the Hue scenery of the river.) QUEBEC, the oldest, and, after Montreal, the most important city in British North America, is situated on the N. W. bank of the St. Lawrence River, at its conflu- nee with the St. Charles, nearly 400 m. from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The city is built on the northern extremity of an elevated tongue of land which forms the 1. bank of the St. Lawrence for several miles. Cape Diamond, so called from the numerous quartz crystals formerly found there, is the loftiest part of the headland, 333 ft. above the stream, and is crowned with the vast fortifications of the Citadel. These occupy about 40 acres, and are considered so impregnable that they have ob tained for Quebec the appellation of the \" Gibraltar of America.\" From the Cita del a line oi wall runs westward toward the cliffs overhanging the valley of the St. Charles, and is thence continued around the brow of the promontory till it connects once more with Cape Diamond near the Governor's Garden. This circuit is nearly 3 m. in extent, and is pierced by five gates, now dismantled. The walls and ram parts outside of the Citadel proper, though still mounted with cannon, are no longer kept in repair. The city is divided into the Upper and Lower Town, the ascent from the latter being by a very steep and winding street (Mountain St.) through Prescott Gate. The Upper Town comprises the walled city with the two suburbs of St. Louis and St. John, between the walls and the Plains of Abraham. The Lower Town is built around the base of the promontory, and constitutes the busi ness quarter. A very large part of the city within the walls, or the Upper Town proper, is taken up with the bnildings and grounds of great religious corporations, the Seminary anil Laval University, the Ursulines and the Hdtel Dieu, and the an cient Jesuit college, founded in 1633 and occupied as a barracks after 1812. Over the remaining irregular surface, not covered by fortifications, are crowded the quaint medi\u00e6val streets and dwellings, built generally of stone, two or three stories high, tind roofed, like the public buildings, with shining tin. The suburbs of St. Louis and St. John stretch southward and westward along the plateau, and are constantly encroaching on the historic Plains of Abraham. They contain many beautiful pri vate residences, and several large conventual establishments and churches. The Lower Town proper is the most ancient part of Quebec. Here, around the vener able church of Notre-Dame des Victoires and the Champlain Market, are the"], [167, "QUEBEC. 149 principal wharves, and steamboat and ferry landings. It is the busiest and most crowded mart of the city, and a conglomeration of irregular streets. Clustered around the base of the cliff, beneath the guns of the grand battery 200 ft. above, are Quebec. the great commercial establishments, the banking-houses, wholesale stores, and bonded warehouses. St. Paul St. stretches westward on the narrow strand between the cliff and the bay, amid breweries, distilleries, and manufactories, till it meets, near the mouth of the St. Charles, St. Joseph St., the main artery of the large suburb of St. Roche. St. Roche and Boisseauville are the homes of the laboring classes. On the banks of the Charles River are the principal ship-yards; and the numerous coves of the St. Lawrence are filled with acres of vast lumber-rafts. On the oppo site shore of the St. Lawrence are the populous towns of South Quebec, New Liver pool, and Point Levi, which present a scene of activity scarcely surpassed by the city itself. The site of Quebec was visited by Cartier in 1534, and the city was founded by Champlain in 1608. It was taken by the English in 1629, and restored to France by the treaty of 1632. In 1690 the neighboring English colonies made an unsuc cessful maritime expedition against it ; and in 1711 the attempt was renewed, with no better success. In 1734 the city had, including its suburbs, 4,603 inhabitants. In 1759, during the Seven Years' War, the English, under General Wolfe, attacked the city and bombarded it. On Sept. 13th took place the first battle of the Plains of Abraham, in which both Wolfe and Montcalm, the French commander, fell, and England gained at one blow an American empire. The French, indeed, recaptured the city the next spring, but at the treaty of peace in 1763 Louis XV. ceded the whole of New France to the English. In December, 1775, a small American force, under General Montgomery, attempted its capture, but failed, after losing 700 men and their commander. The population of the city at that time was only 5,000. In 1861 it was 59,990, and in 1871 59,699, the decrease being attributed to the with drawal of the British troops forming the garrison. Quebec has a large maritime com merce, and is one of the greatest lumber and timber markets on the American Conti nent. The principal articles of manufacture are ships, saw-mill products, boots and shoes, bakery products, furniture, and foundery products and machinery. Hotels: The St. Louis Hotel ($3 to $4 a day), in St. Louis St. near Durham Ter race; the Russell House, cor. Ann and Garden Sts. ; the Stadacona House, in Palace St. ; and the Blanchard Hotel, in the Lower Town. The two latter are inexpen sive, and frequented by business-men, etc. 11"], [168, "150 HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. Modes of Conveyance. \u2014 Horse-cars traverse the streets along the river in the Lower Town and extend to the suburbs. Carriages or caliches maybe hired at the livery stables. The caliche, a two-wheeled one-horse apparatus, is the usual vehicle, and costs about 75c. an hour. Ferries connect the city with South Quebec, New Liver pool, and Point Levi, on the opposite side of the St. Lawrence, and run three times a day to the Isle of Orleans. Public and Prominent Buildings.\u2014 The only important public buildings in the Lower Town are the Custom-IIouse, the Merchants' Exchange, and Champlain Market. The Cnstom-Honse is reached by St. Peter St., and occupies the very apex of the point made by the confluence of the St. Lawrence and the St. Charles Rivers. It is an imposing Doric edifice, with a dome, and a facade of noble columns, ap proached by a long flight of steps. Champlain Market is a spacious and handsome stone building on the river-bank, near Champlain St. The other principal buildings are in the Upper Town. The Post-Office is in St. Anne St., and near by is the Bishop's Police, a stately and elegant structure. The Parliament-Honse is a large but unpretentious building, to the r. from Mountain St., just inside the ramparts of the Upper Town. It occupies the site of Champlain's fort and the old Episcopal palace. The Court-House is a massive edifice of stone, fronting on St. Louis St. near the Protestant Cathedral. A short distance beyond, on the same street, is the Masonic Hall, opposite which is the large and imposing St. Louis Hotel. In the centre of the Upper Town Market Sqnare is surrounded by more or less striking buildings. On the E. side are the Cathedral and the extensive buildings of the Seminary of Quebec, which will be described further on ; and on the W. side are the vast and ancient Jesuits' College buildings, dating in part from 1646, and now used for barracks. The square itself presents a highly-interesting sight on market mornings, when the peasants from the neighboring country bring in their farm products. The Artillery Barracks form a range of stone buildings 5,000 ft. in length, fronting on St. Helene St. near the ramparts. Other noteworthy buildings are the City Hall, the Quebec Music Hall, and the city Theatre, all in the Upper Town. The most frequented retail-shops are in Fabrique and St. John Sts., and about the Roman Catholic Cathe dral. Churches. \u2014 The most remarkable of these is the Roman Catholic Cathedral, which stands on the E. side of Market Square. It was elevated to the rank of a basilica in October, 1874, on the occasion of the second centenary of the erection of the See of Quebec. It is of cut stone, 216 ft. long and 180 wide, and capable of seating 4,000 persons. The exterior of the edifice is very plain, but the interior is richly decorated, and contains several original paintings of great value by Vandyke, Oaracci, Halle, and others. In this cathedral lie the remains of Champlain, the founder and first governor of the city. The church of Notre-Dame des Victoires (Roman Catholic), in the Lower Town, is noticeable for its antiquity ; it was built and used as a church before 1690. The Anglican Cathedral, a plain, gray-stone edifice, surmounted by a tall spire, stands in the centre of a large square in St. Anne St. near Durham Terrace. Tradition points to its site as the spot where Cham plain erected his first tent. Adjoining the Cathedral is the rectory and the pretty little Chapel of All Saints. The Wesleyan Church, in St. Stanislaus St., is a fine specimen of the flamboyant Gothic style. St. Andrew's (Presbyterian) isa spacious stone structure in the Gothic style, situated in St. Anne St. Near by are a manse and school belonging to the same congregation. The Chapel of the Gray Nuns, on the Glacis, W. of the ramparts and adjoining the Nunnery, is a lofty and elegant Gothic edifice, with a rich interior. St. John's (Roman Catholic), in St. John St. near St. Claire, is one of the largest churches in the city. St. Patrick's (Roman Catholic), in St. Helene St., has a neat Ionic interior ; and St. Sauveur and St. Roche are noteworthy churches in the suburbs. The Methodist Centenary Chapel is in the St. Louis suburb. Educational and Charitable Institutions, etc. \u2014 The most important educational insti tution is the \" Seminary of Quebec,\" with its offshoot, the Laval University. This seminary was sounded in 1663, and was raised to the rank of a university in 1852. The three buildings occupied by the university are on the E. side of Market Square,"], [169, "QUEBEC. 151 adjoining the Cathedral, and are very imposing. They are of cut stone, 576 ft. long (the main building being 286 ft.), five stories high, and cost $240,000. The chemi cal laboratory is spacious, fire-proof, and provided with complete apparatus; the geological, mineralogical, and botanical collections, are very valuable; the museum of zoology contains upward of 1,300 different birds and 7,000 insects; and the mu seum of the medical department is especially complete. The library contains upward of 55,000 volumes, besides the libraries belonging to the theological and preparatory departments, amounting to about 20,000 volumes more. The gallery of paintings, lately thrown open to the public, contains 150 originals, duplicates, and copies, some of them very valuable. Morrin College occupies the old stone prison, in the centre of the Upper Town. In one of the halls is the extensive library of the Quebec Historical Society, to which the public has access. The High-School has 200 students and an excellent library. The Marine Hospital, built on the model of the Temple of the Muses on the banks of the Ilissus, is an imposing stone edifice near the St. Charles River. Close by is the General Hospital, an immense range of build ings. This institution was founded in 1693, and is under the charge of the nuns ot St. Augustine. The Hotel Dieu, with its convent and hospital, stands just outside the Palace-Gate. It was founded in 1639 by the Duchess d'Aiguillon, and in 1875 comprised 45 Sisters of the Sacred Blood of Dieppe, who minister gratuitously to 10,000 patients yearly. The Crsnlinc Convent, in Garden St., S. of Market Square, is a striking series of buildings surrounded by extensive and beautiful grounds. This establishment was founded in 1639, and now has 40 nuns who are devoted to teaching girls, and also to painting, needlework, etc. The parlor and chapel are open to visitors, and in the latter are some fine paintings by Vandyke, Champagne, and others. The remains of the Marquis de Montcalm are buried here in an excavation made by the bursting of a shell within the precincts of the convent. The Gray Nunnery is a spacious building on the Glacis W. of the ramparts, and contains about 75 Sisters. The Black Nunnery is in the suburbs of St. Roche. Application to the Lady Superiors will usually secure admittance to the nunneries. Miscellaneous Places of Interest. \u2014 The point to which the attention of the stranger in Quebec is first directed is Durham Terrace, which lies just S. of the Prescott Gate, along the edge of the cliff, towering 200 ft. above the river. It occupies the site of the old Chateau of St. Louis, built by Champlain in 1620, and destroyed by fire in 1834. The outlook from the Terrace is one of the finest in the world, and is of it self worth a trip to Quebec. The Esplanade, near the St. Louis Gate, is another at tractive promenade ; and the walk along the Ramparts, between the St. Louis Gate and St. John's Gate, affords prospects rivaled by few in America. The view from the Grand Battery, near the Laval University, is considered by many to be finer even than that from Durham Terrace ; and that from the vast balcony of the University building is nearly as impressive. The Place d'Armes, or Parade-Ground, is a pleasant little park adorned -with a fine fountain, lying between the Anglican Cathedral and Durham Terrace. Des Carrieres St., running S. from this, leads to the Governor's Gar den, in rear of the Citadel, containing an obelisk (65 ft. high) to the memory of Wolfe and Montcalm. The Plains of Abraham are reached via the St. Louis Gate ; on the spot where Wolfe fell in the memorable battle of September 13, 1759, stands Wolfe's Monument, a modest column appropriately inscribed. A short distance to the 1. is the path by which his army scaled the cliffs on the night before the battle ; it is somewhat shorn of its rugged character, but is still precipitous and forbidding. On the Plains, near the St. Foy road, stands the Monument commemorating the victory won by the Chevalier de Levis over General Murray in 1760. It is a handsome iron column, surmounted by a bronze statue of Bellona (presented by Prince Napoleon), and was erected in 1854. About 3 m. out on the St. Louis road is Mount Herinon Cemetery, 32 acres in extent, beautifully laid out on irregular ground, sloping down the precipices which overhang the St. Lawrence. All along the St. Louis and St. Foy roads are elegant private residences, surrounded by gardens. The suburbs of Quebec present many points of interest which the tourist should not fail to visit. The Isle of Orleans (reached by ferry-boat) is a beautiful spot, and"], [170, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 152 the drive around it offers a succession of noble views. There are also pleasant drives to Spencer Wood, the Governor-General's residence in the days before Quebec was decapitalized, and to Chateau-Bigot, an antique and massive ruin, standing- in solitary loneliness at the toot ot the Charlesbourg Mountain. Lorette, an ancient village of the Huron Indians, is reached by a 9 m. drive along the= banks of St. Charles River. The falls near the village are very picturesque, and Lake St. Charles, a famous fish ing-place, is only a few miles off. The Falls of Montmorenei, 8 m. below Quebec, are 250 ft. high and 50 ft. wide, and are wonderfully beautiful. A short distance above the Falls is the \"Man sion House,\" in which the Duke ot Kent passed the summer of 1791 ; and about 1 m. above are the curious Nat ural Steps, a succession of ledges cut by the river in the limestone rockT each about 1 ft. high, and as regularly arranged as if they were the work of human hands. The Falls of the Chan diere (18 m.) are reached via Point Levi on the opposite side of the St. Lawrence. The rapid river plunges. in a sheet 350 ft. wide over a preci pice 150 ft. high, presenting very much the look of boiling water, whence its. Wolfe's Monument, Quebec name chaudiere, or caldron. The Falls of St. Anne, in the river St. Anne, 24 m. below Quebec, are extremely beautiful, and are in the neighborhood of picturesque scenery (tri-weekly steamers from Quebec). OTTAWA. (Keached from Montreal via steamer up the Ottawa River |101 m.l ; or via Grand Trunk E. R. to Pres- cott, and thence via St. Lawrence & Ottawa E. R. [170 m.].

Hotels: The Russell House ($2.50 to $3 a day), near the Parliament Buildings; Daniel's Hotel ($2 a day), in the Upper Town ; the Albion Hotel, on Court-House Square. OTTAWA, the capital of the Dominion of Canada, is situated on the S. bank of the Ottawa River, at the mouth of the Rideau. It is divided into an Upper and Lower Town by the Rideau Canal, which passes through it and connects it with Kingston, on Lake Ontario. The canal is crossed within the city limits by two bridges, one of stone and one of stone and iron, and has eight massive locks. Bridges also connect Ottawa with the suburban towns of Hull and New Edinburgh, on the opposite side of the Ottawa River. The streets are wide and regular, the principal ones being Sparks and Sussex. The former is the popular promenade, and contains the leading retail-shops, etc. Horse-cars traverse the main thoroughfares, and connect the city with towns across the river (fare, 6c). Ottawa was origi nally called Bytown, in honor of Colonel By, of the Royal Engineers, by whom it was laid out in 1827. It was incorporated as a city under its present name in 1854, and was selected by Queen Victoria as the seat of the Canadian Government in 1858. It has grown rapidly since the latter date, and now has a population of about 23,000. The city is the entrepot of the lumber-trade of the Ottawa and its tribu taries, and has a number of large saw-mills, several flour-mills, and manufactories of iron-castings, mill machinery, agricultural implements, etc."], [171, "OTTAWA 153 Ottawa is substantially built, containing many stone edifices, but the Government Buildings are the chief feature of the city. They form three sides of a vast quad rangle on an eminence known as Barrack Hill, 150 ft. above the river, and cost nearly $4,000,000. The S. side of the quadrangle is formed by the Parliament- House, which is 472 ft. long and 572 ft. deep from the front of the main tower to Parliament-House, Ottawa. the rear of the library, the body of the building being 40 ft. high and the centra tower 180 ft. The Departmental Buildings run N. from this, forming the E. and W. -sides of the quadrangle ; the Eastern block is 318 ft. long by 253 ft. deep, and the Western 211 ft. long by 277 deep. They contain the various Government bureaus, the Post-Office and the Model-Room of the Patent-Office, being in the west block. The buildings are constructed in the Italian-Gothic style, of cream-colored sand stone. The arches of the doors and windows are of red Potsdam sandstone, the external ornamental work of Ohio sandstone, and the columns and arches of the legislative chambers of marble. The roofs are covered with green and purple slates, and the pinnacles are ornamented with iron painted in brilliant colors. The legislative chambers are capacious and richly furnished, and have stained-glass win dows. The Senate-Hall is reached to the r. from the main entrance (which is un der the central tower). The viceregal canopy and throne are at one end of this hall, and at the other are a marble statue and a portrait, of Queen Victoria, togeth er with full-length portraits of George III. and Queen Charlotte by Sir Joshua Reynolds. The Chamber of Commons is reached to the 1. from the entrance, and -contains some beautiful marble columns and arches. The Library is a handsome polygonal structure on the N. front of the Parliament-House, containing at present about 40,000 volumes. The quadrangle is neatly laid out and planted with trees, tmd has a massive stone wall along its front. Rideau Hall, the official residence of the Governor-General, is in New Edinburgh, across the Ottawa River. After the Government Buildings, the most important edifice in the city is the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Notre-Dame, which is one of the handsomest churches in Canada. It is a spacious stone structure, with double spires 200 ft. high. The in terior is imposing, and contains a painting (\" The Flight into Egypt \") which is at tributed to Murillo. Other handsome church edifices are St. Andreic's (Presbyte rian), and St. Patrick's (Roman Catholic). The Ottawa University (Roman Catho-"], [172, "HAND-BOOK OF AMERICAN CITIES. 154 lie) has a large building in Wilbrod St., and the Ladies' College (Protestant), a very handsome one, in Albert St. The Gray Nunnery is an imposing stone structure at the corner of Bolton and Sussex Sts. The Black Nunnery has several buildings just E. of Carrier Square. There are in the city two convents, two hospitals, three orphan asylums, and a Magdalen asylum. The eight massive Canal Locks, within the cor poration limits, are worth a visit. The scenery in the vicinity of Ottawa is picturesque and grand. At the W. ex tremity are the Chandiere Falls, named after those near Quebec. They are 40 ft. high and over 200 ft. wide ; they are situated near the centre of the river, and the water that flow over them are strongly compressed by the rocks that stretch out and im pede them. In the great Chaudiire (or caldron) the sounding-line has not found bottom at 300 ft. Immediately below the falls is a suspension-bridge, from which at superb view is obtained. One mile above the city are the Little Chaudiire Falls, 13 ft. high, and 2 m. above are the rapids known as St. Remoux. The De Cheine Rapids, 8 m. above Ottawa, have a fall of 9 ft. The Rideau Falls, two in number, are in the N. E. portion of the city on the Rideau River, and are very attractive, though eclipsed by the grandeur of the Chaudiere. It being impossible safely to run lumber over the falls, \" shoots \" or inclined planes have been constructed, down which the rafts rush with amazing rapidity. TORONTO.

It affords the richest lustre. It remains longest in effect. It prevents the hair from falling off. It promotes its healthy, vigorous growth. It is not greasy nor sticky. It leaves no disagreeable odor. A REMARKABLE CASE. \"East Middleboro1. Mass., ) '\"June 9, 1864. J \" Messrs.

She had not used half the con tents of a bottle before her head was covered with fine young hair.

Printed from new type, and illustrated with Several Thousand Engravings and Maps. The work originally published under the title of The New American Cyclop\u00e6dia was completed in 1863, since which time the wide circulation which it has attained in all parts of the United States, and the signal developments which have taken place in every branch of science, literature, and art, have induced the editors and publishers to submit it to an exact and thorough revision, and to issue a new edition entitled The American Cyclop\u00e6dia. In preparing the present edition for the press, it has accordingly been the aim of the editors to bring down the information to the latest possible dates, and to fur nish an accurate account of the most receut discoveries in science, of every fresh production in literature, and of the newest inventions in the practical arts, as well as to give a succinct and original record of the progress of political and historical events. The illustrations, which are introduced for the first time in the present edition, have been added not for the sake of pictorial effect, but to give greater lucidity and force to the explanations in the text. They embrace all branches of science and of natural history, and depict the most famous and remarkable features of scenery, architecture, and art, as well as the various processes of mechanics and manufact ures. Although intended for instruction rather than embellishment, no pains have been spared to insure their artistic excellence ; the cost of their execution is enor mous, and it is believed they will find a welcome reception as an admirable feature of the Cyclop\u00e6dia, and worthy of its high character. This work is sold to Subscribers only, payable on delivery of each volume.

In our January number we alluded to the genuine enterprise of Dr. Dundas Dick, the gentleman who coats fluid medicines with a film of gelatine, so that they shall not offend the palate. Our remarks were merely by way of comment upon an article in the JV. Y. Reporter. A Christian friend of ours, a druggist by profession, calls attention to our article and reminds us that, in our well-intentioned comments on Dr. Dick's business habits, we omitted one very essential point \u2014 his sterling honesty. Our friend thinks that, ordinarily, too much credit is given to energy and business activity, and too little to those weightier qualities which go to make up the substan tial character \u2014 integrity and scrupulous fair-dealing. He says that the example to be placed before men is nut that of success achieved by cunning, or by push, or by notoriety, but that of wealth accumulated or influence gained by righteousness \u2014 that is, by right-doing. Our friend is correct, and we never held to any other view. When we said that Dr. Dick's success, like the success of Mr. A. T. Stewart, resulted largely from his ability to do, better than any of his many employes can do, all the multifarious duties of his factory, we did not mean to indicate that his intimate practical acquaintance with the details of his vast business could be considered as taking the place of in tegrity. Knowledge cannot compentate for lack of honesty. The two must go hand in hand, or failure will come sooner or later. A good lady, who knew Mr. Stewart when he had only one clerk, told us a few days ago that he never allowed that clerk or any of the many thousands since and now in his employ, to recommend goods offered for sale. His plan has always been to exhibit the articles and let them do their own talking. So with Dr. Dick. Physicians know that they can prescribe his pure, protected remedies with the certainty that the result anticipated will follow their use. They are just what they purport to be, nothing more, nothing less. It is as if he were to seal up pure oils and balsams and terebinthinates in transparent glass, so far as purity is concerned. The only difference is, that the glass is soluble and nutritious, being made of transparent gelatine. <^ Dr. Dick is not a manufacturer of \" patent medicines.\" His tasteless remedies are not secret or proprietary nostrums, but are strictly \" officinal ; \" that is, author ized medicines of the United States Dispensatory. It is only in selecting pure, fresh drugs, and protecting them well, rapidly, and elegantly, that Dr. Dick's great skill is shown. The drugs thus inclosed are potent, active, powerful, and are usually or dered by physicians. Druggists of our acquaintance testify that more than three fourths of all Dr. Dick's goods sold are called for by written prescriptions. When thus ordered, the druggist removes the outer wrapper, and only the magic letters \" D. D. & Co.\" denote the maker's name. The products of no chemist's laboratory stand higher than his. He has earned his popularity by fair-dealing, and, by the integrity of his methods and the purity of his medicines, placed himself on the plane occupied by Dr. Squibb of Brooklyn, whose manufactured drugs stand at the head. If knowledge, energy, and good taste have done much of this, integrity has done even more. Druggists and doctors know that Dick's tasteless medicines can be relied upon. In the one word \u2014 faith fulness \u2014 we have the causes of his vast success clearly summed up. \u2014 HalVx Journal of Health, March, 1876."], [194, "FOR 1876. i APPLETONS' JOTJKNAL, A HOUSEHOLD WEEKLY MAGAZINE, Devoted to Popular Literature, and all Matters of Taste and Culture.
