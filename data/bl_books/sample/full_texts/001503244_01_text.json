Werner (Lyell), by his simple dictum, caused a retro grade movement, and not only overturned the true theory, but substituted for it one of the most unphilosophical that can be well imagined.\" In reference to the theory that valleys are B"], [14, "2 LYELL'S FOUR CONTRADICTORY [Ch. I. Lyell's own particular theory of the formation of valleys. formed by \"rain and rivers,\" these words of Lyell are true of himself as I have altered them. There is, perhaps, no creed of man which, like this, can be traced up to the most remote an tiquity, and traced down from the most remote antiquity to the present day. Lyell has himself quoted Pythagoras for it, through the medium of Ovid : Eluvie mons est deductus in \u00e6quor. Quodque suit campus vallem decursus aquarum Fecit. But Pythagoras only enunciates the doctrine of Eastern antiquity ; that is, of the Egyptians, the Chald\u00e6ans, and the Hindoos. But since Pythagoras introduced this doctrine in the West, if it has ever slumbered, it has been perpetually reoriginated. Lyell shows that among the Greeks it was taught by Aristotle ; among the Romans by Strabo; among the Saracens by Avicenna; in Italy by Moro, Generelli, and Targioni ; and in England by Ray, Hutton, and Playfair. In contradiction, however, to these authorities, ancient and modern, \u2014 in contradiction, as I think, to common sense, and in contradiction to three other theories which he himself uses, \u2014 Lyell has started a theory of his own in reference to the formation of valleys. He conceives, that as land has been slowly raised through the sea"], [15, "Ch. I.] THEORIES OF FORMING VALLEYS. 3 Origin of allu vial plains. and above it by subterranean heat, the waves and currents of the sea have formed the valleys. In the second edition of the \" Tree-lifter,\" I answered, \" That the action of waves on land slowly emerging from the deep should have a tendency to wash away soft parts and to leave hard parts, I can conceive ; but to attribute the formation of our valleys to this cause, is to sup pose that the materials of all the valleys running from the tops of all the heights on the globe were originally softer than the materials of the intervening ridges ; but in almost all cases we can see that this is not so, by the corresponding strata on the opposite sides of valleys. In regard to currents : a current might de capitate a continent as it rose, supposing equal softness of materials, or it might scoop a hori zontal groove of any size or depth, or (granting lines of hard intervening ridges) many grooves. But they must all be horizontal, and in one direction. No marine current could make a single channel sloping from a height to the sea; still less the myriads on myriads of dry upper valleys which ramify in all directions, from all river valleys, through and to all sides of the tops of all elevations, whether high or low. The sea ends every valley, but it never yet began one. That is, when the river has done B 2"], [16, "4 lyell's four contradictory [Ch. I. its utmost, it is the sea which prevents the far ther deepening of the valley. But as the denu dation and deepening of the inclined upper parts continue, the lower part of the valley becomes horizontal. The passage of the detritus of the upper parts is then checked in this horizontal part, and soil accumulates there backward up the valley. This is the origin of alluvial plains, which I have never seen an attempt to account for. They seem, by common consent, to be omitted in all theories of the formation of valleys. Alluvial plains are, however, frequent features over the globe, and most important features. Yet neither the formation of any one of them nor the present and perpetual daily growth of each of them, can be accounted for except by the principles which I advocate. And instead of the sea forming valleys in the land, valleys often form land in the sea, that is, deltas ; and, as the sea by checking the longitudinal rush of rivers allows this deposit of land forward in it, the sea may thus be said to assist in prolonging valleys. \"Bottle off the sea\" and all estuaries, and their valleys will be deepened ; for the tidal part of each river will be a torrent on the brow of a mountain. In this case deltas and allu viums would disappear ; but they would not \" go with a run,\" or by the direct action of rivers."], [17, "Ch. I.] THEORIES OF FORMING VALLEYS. 5 Rivers would only cut ravines through them backward from the sea, the rest must wait for disintegration and the wash of rain. The sea begins them and preserves them now. And in this sense the sea may be said to fill valleys in, instead of scooping them out. This subject will be treated in the last chapter. But besides this No. 1. theory of his own, which I shall call the submarine theory, Lyell freely adopts three other theories, each of them contradictory to his own theory, and each con tradictory to the other. No. 2., a theory of Mr. Hopkins's that valleys are cracks formed in the igneous elevation of the land ; and Lyell says that Mr. Hopkins accounts for these \" by mathematical methods,\" I shall call this the igneous mathematical theory. No. 3., the ero sion of their banks by rivers, the erosion theory ; and No. 4., the subaerial denudation from dis integration and the wash of rain, the subaerial theory. All these four theories Lyell uses, sometimes each as if it was his only theory, and always each as if it were consistent with the other three. Indeed, I think I shall show that a fifth and a sixth theory for the formation of valleys may fairly be placed to Lyell's credit (or discredit?) Let us try if one theory will not suffice : B 3"], [18, "6 lyell's four contradictory [Ch. I. Valleys formed according to three out of four of Lyell's theories should be bare of soil. Valleys are rich in soil. the last of the four, the subaerial theory ; and if in supporting this theory against the three first, arguments are sometimes used against all three generally, and sometimes the fight is shifted abruptly from one particular theory to the other, the blame must not be laid on the writer of this. If either of the first three theories were true ; if valleys were formed by submarine denuda tion, either by waves or currents ; or if they were formed by \" mathematical earthquakes,\" or by the erosion of their banks by rivers, in all these cases valleys ought to be more bare of soil than any other parts of the earth. But they are more rich in soil than any other parts of the earth. Soil is simply rotten subsoil (mixed with vegetable remains). But there are particular spaces so steep (precipices) that even gravity or wind, independent of the wash of rain, would never suffer a grain of soil to remain on them for an instant. Soil is not the less in perpetual formation on these spaces. The faces of pre cipices' and bare rocks rot, and thus soil is in perpetual formation over the whole surface of the earth. And from the whole surface of the earth it is in perpetual movement, by the wash of rain to the bottom of the sea. This travel-"], [19, "7 Ch. I.] THEORIES OF FORMING VALLEYS. Accumulation of man's sub sistence and therefore man's existence greatly dependent on accumulation of soil. ling rotten part of the earth is the only part which supports vegetable existence, and con sequently animal existence. The reason why valleys are richer in soil than other parts ofthe earth, is, that they are the roads which soil travels to the sea. And the same cause which has excavated valleys, and which still denudes them \u2014 rain \u2014 also deposits in them. And valleys always hold soil as rivers always hold water, though the soil and the water are both in transitu. Directly as each valley length ens, its longitudinal slope becomes gentle. Di rectly as it widens, its lateral slope becomes gentle. And directly as the gentleness of the slope of each valley is the accumulation of soil. For as rain takes the soil from the hill-top down the valley to the sea, in proportion to the flatness of the valley will deposit of soil exceed denu dation. Man's subsistence, and therefore his existence, depend very much on these vast ac cumulations of soil. And therefore (I was going to say) it is of infinite consequence to man to know the principles on which depend the forma tion, accumulation, and denudation of soil. But man \u2014 \"poor hungry sinner\" \u2014 does not wait for his dinner till he is shown where to get it by a scientific theory. He finds by practice where B 4"], [20, "LYELL'S FOUR CONTRADICTORY [Ch. I. 8 he can grow the crops which support him and his domestic animals. There are, however, in finite myriads of cases where denudation of soil may be retarded by man, and where accumulation of soil may be facilitated by him, if the true principles on which these depend are understood. And so far the knowledge of these principles may be said to be of consequence to us all, quicunque terr\u00e6 munere vescimur, from the labourer to the throne, sive reges sive inopes erimus coloni. But besides our food, besides producing and supporting the vegetable crops and animals most valuable to man, alluvial deposits are the maga zines of the minerals most valued by man. Pla tina, gold (5500^. worth has been picked up in one nugget), diamonds, and precious stones, are sifted, sorted, and stored by Nature in these beds, during her universal operations of disin tegration, denudation, and deposit. The subject, also, is of vital importance \u2014 the very foundation stone \u2014 in theories of geology and physical geo graphy ; also in engineering questions touching harbours and docks, the embanking of alluvial rivers, the reclaiming of land from the sea or marshes (works which place in daily jeopardy millions of lives), and the drainage, sewage, and supply of water to \"the cities of the plain.\" And"], [21, "9 Ch. I.] THEORIES OF FORMING VALLEYS. last, and oh, ye gold-finders and utilitarians, not least, the boundless store Of charms which nature to her votary yields, the subject explains the origin even of these. The alternation of the ravine and ridge, the hill and dale, the exquisite beauty of the earth's surface \u2014 of all that we see of the earth \u2014 the \" dread magnificence \" of the Alpine chasm, and the rich loveliness of the alluvial vale, are the everchanging products resulting from (start not at the bathos) the daily \" wash of rain.\" In addition, therefore, to what I published in the second edition of the \" Tree-lifter,\" I shall devote this treatise to what I conceive to be the errors of Lyell on this important subject. For I think that I can show that this illustrious writer is here not only contradictory to what we see in nature, but completely contradictory to him self throughout."], [22, "10 TERRACES OF GLEN ROY, [Ch.

COMPARATIVE ETERNITY OF CONES OWING TO THEIR SHAPE. CLIFFS ON THE SEINE NOT MARINE. I will again begin the chapter by applying Lyell's own words to himself: \"A false theory, it is well known, may render us blind to facts which are opposed to our prepossessions, or may con ceal from us their true import when we behold them.\" In reference to Lyell's own submarine theory of forming valleys, I had intended to ex tract from the beginning of his \"Elements,\" 2nd edition, to the end of his \" Principles,\" 7th edition, all passages contradicting that theory in particular, or each other generally. I found"], [23, "Ch. II.] AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE. 11 that I became far too voluminous. For the questions of denudation in the formation of valleys, and of deposit in the formation of all strata, alluviums, and drift -beds are of such universal and constant occurrence and recur rence in geology, that there is scarcely a page in Lyell's works in which he will not be found an unwilling and unintentional witness against his own submarine theory, and in favour of the common-sense plan of forming valleys by \" rain and rivers.\" But though I have thus been obliged to curtail my extracts, I have still re tained my original order of operations. Parallel Roads of Glen Roy. In reference to the formation of the parallel terraces of Glen Roy, Lyell (\"Elements,\" chap. vii.) concurs in these words with'Dr. M'Culloch, Sir T. D. Lauder, Mr. Darwin, and Mr. Agassiz. There is one point, however, on which all are agreed, namely, that these shelves are ancient Terraces of Glen Roy prove enormous denudation in former times."], [24, "12 [Ch. II TERRACES OF GLEN ROY, beaches, or littoral formations, accumulated round the edges of one or more sheets of water, which once stood at the level, first of the highest shelf, and successively at the height of the two others. It is well known that, wherever a lake or fiord exists surrounded by steep mountains, subject to disintegration by frost or the action of torrents, some loose matter is washed down annually, es- pecially during the melting of snoio, and a check is given to the descent of the detritus at the point where it reaches the waters of the lake.\" Now here is a denudation not longitudinal, or, as Lyell has just said, from \"the action of tor rents,\" or, as Professor Sedgwick would say, \" acting on lines,\" but lateral. It is a denudation of an enormous breadth of hillside. For, as Lyell says, these terraces extend \" over a space of many leagues in length,\" and \" they are from ten to sixty feet broad.\" And it is not, as Lyell has said, that \" a check is given to the descent of the detritus at the point where it reaches the waters of the lake,\" but that all denudation ceases there. Subaqueous regions are indeed the regions of deposit, as sub aerial regions are the regions of denudation. But deposit takes place at the bottom, not at the top of water ; and these terraces are not formed by the accumulation of deposit, but by the ab-"], [25, "Ch. II.] AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE. 13"], [26, "14 TERRACES OF GLEN ROY, [Ch. II. sence of denudation compared with the parts above them. The \" detritus,\" from the denu dation instead of being arrested \" at the point where it reached the waters of the lake,\" went to the bottom of the lake, and has long since been cleared out of the valley by the same power which brought it in to the valley \u2014 rain. Why should If these philosophers are all agreed (and who will disagree with them ?) that this enormous denudation of the hill-sides and tops took place in former days, should they not give us some reason why it should have ceased in these days ? But from this, and from what follows, one would think that Lyell supposes denudation of hills only to go on in the neighbourhood of sheets of water and lakes, that is, \" wherever a lake or fiord exists;\" and that, when the sheets of water have vanished, or the lakes have been filled up, the denudation ceases. For he de scribes (\" Elements,\" chapter xvi.) the filling up of the enormous ancient lakes of Auvergne by the denudation and deposit from the wash of rain. But he neglects to infer that the same denudation must still go on there, and deposit from that denudation somewhere ; and that this denudation of land and deposit in water must pervade the entire terraqueous globe. this denudation have ceased now ? Lakes of Au vergne first filled with allu vium, then cut into hills and valleys by rain and rivers. Page 3G2. he writes : \" Before entering on"], [27, "15 Ch.

Great lakes have disappeared ; lofty mountains have been formed by the reiterated emission of lava, preceded and followed by showers of sand and scori\u00e6 ; deep valleys have been subsequently furrowed out through masses of lacustrine and volcanic origin. At a still later date, new cones have been thrown up in these valleys ; new lakes have been formed by the damming up of rivers, and more than one creation of quadrupeds, birds, and plants have followed in succession ; yet the region has preserved from first to last its geographical identity ; and we can still recall to our thoughts"], [28, "16 [Ch. II. TERRACES OF GLEN ROY, its external condition and physical structure before these wonderful vicissitudes began, or while a part only of the whole had been com- pleted. There was first a period when the spacious lakes, of which we still may trace the boundaries, lay at the foot of mountains of moderate elevation, unbroken by the bold peaks and precipices of Mont d'Or, and unadorned by the picturesque outline of the Puy de Dome, or of the volcanic cones and craters now covering the granitic platform. During this earlier scene of repose, deltas were slowly formed ; beds of marl and sand several hundred feet thick de- posited ; siliceous and calcareous rocks pre- cipitated from the waters of mineral springs; shells and insects imbedded, together with the remains of the crocodile and tortoise, the eggs and bones of water-birds, and the skeletons of quadrupeds, some of them belonging to the same genera as those entombed in the gypsum of Paris. To this tranquil condition of the sur- face succeeded the era of volcanic eruptions, when the lakes were drained, and when the fer- tility of the mountainous district was probably enhanced by the igneous matter ejected from below, and poured down upon the more sterile granite.

Lastly, these quadrupeds became extinct, and gave place to the existing creation. Tliere are no signs during the whole time required for this series of events of the sea having inter vened, nor of any denudation lohich may not have been accomplished by currents in the different lakes, or by rivers and floods accompanying repeated earthquakes, during which the levels of the dis trict have in some places been materially modi fied, and perhaps the whole upraised relatively to the surrounding parts of France.\" Notwithstanding that \" there are no signs of the sea having intervened,\" Lyell says that these \" lacustrine strata, which must have filled a hol low, have been denuded and shaped out into hills and valleys on the site of the ancient lakes.\" Here Lyell is not only in direct contradiction to his submarine theory of the formation of val leys, but also to his anti-catastrophe system, and his \" causes now in operation \" system ; and ob serve how he changes from one agent to the other. \" During the earlier scenes of repose \" c"], [30, "18 [Ch.

But for the shaping of these deposits \"into hills and"], [31, "Ch. II.] AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE. 19 Why valleys grow wider as they descend valleys\" after \"the lakes were drained,\" Lyell gives no reason at all. But grant subaerial denudation and deposit, and the filling in of the lakes with drift and alluvium, the storing these with fossils of land animals, and the cutting of valleys through the deposits, are all matters of course and plane sailing. The wash of rain and rivers first fill the ancient lakes with drift and alluvium, and the same floods which form the drift store it with land animals. But while this was doing, and ever since it was accomplished, rain and rivers have been eroding the dams or barriers which originally formed the lakes. And as these barriers were gradually worn away, channels were cut longitudinally through the deposits which filled the lakes. Then come disintegration and the lateral wash of rain to widen these chan nels into valleys. And the lower parts of these valleys, speaking longitudinally, and the higher parts, speaking laterally, being gradually and in succession earlier exposed to these wasting causes, supposing equal hardness of material, disappear earlier. This is the cause of the in creasing width of valleys as they descend. These causes are as hard at work now as ever they were. And in future ages rain and rivers will abstract from these valleys or ancient lakes c 2"], [32, "20 [Ch. II. TERRACES OF GLEN HOY, every particle which in former ages they de posited there. This would not be the case if the Adriatic or any arm of the sea were filled up, because the sea would keep the mouths of the rivers at one level, and prevent them cutting channels through their own deposits. Many people consider a valley to be like a tea cup, or the happy valley of Rasselas, without an outlet. But valleys are like inclined troughs, open at the lower end. In the case of cups or crevices without outlets, formed in the original elevation of the land, rain instantly begins to fill them with water and alluvium. Should either of these reach the lowest part of the brim, rain erodes that brim, makes an outlet, and pro ceeds to let off the water, or to clear out the alluvium which it has before deposited. This holds true from the largest of the American lakes (for rivers are subterranean rain, that is, rain reappearing) to the smallest puddle on a road. As might be expected, the ancient alluviums formed in hollows on dry land are the grand museums of the remains of land animals, as strata deposited in the sea, though equally by the wash of rain from the land, are of the marine creation. I would here call attention to these facts, which I shall allude to again in the"], [33, "Ch.

And because land animals are only found in numbers in recent land deposits, it is a mistake to argue that they did not exist during the period of the deposit of the most ancient marine strata. The whole of the thirty-first chapter of the \" Elements \" seems written to disprove Lyell's own theory ofthe submarine formation of valleys, and to prove that they are formed by the sub aerial denudation of rain and rivers. The fol lowing are extracts : \u2014 With regard to the Plomb du Cantal, which is a volcanic \" mountain several thousand feet in height,\" and which has never been under the sea, and therefore should have no valleys : \" Val leys radiate in all directions from the natural heights of the mountain, increasing in size as they recede from those heights. Those of the Cer and Jourdanne, which are more than twenty miles in length, are of great depth, and lay open the geological structure ofthe mountain.\" Speaking generally, he says : \" The lavas may often be traced from the crater to the nearest valley, where they usurp the channel of the river, which has frequently exca'vated a deep \u2022c 3"], [34, "22 [Ch.

We have thus an opportunity of contrasting the enormous degra dation which the solid and massive rock has suffered by aqueous erosion, and the integrity of the cone of sand and ashes, which has in the meantime remained uninjured on the neighbour ing platform, where it was placed beyond the reach of the power of running water.\" With regard to the Puy de Come, a stream of lava fills \" the ancient river-channel for the distance of more than a mile. The Sioule, thus dispossessed of its bed, has worked out a fresh one between the lava and the granite of its western bank ; and the excavation has disclosed in one spot a wall of columnar basalt about fifty feet high. The excavation of the ravine is still in progress, every winter some columns of basalt being vindermined and carried down the channel of the river, and, in the course of a few miles, rolled to sand and pebbles. Meanwhile, the cone of Come remains stationary, its loose ma terials being protected by a dense vegetation, and the hill standing on a ridge not commanded by any higher ground whence floods of rain water may descend. At another point, farther down the course ofthe Sioule,\" \"the river has excavated a ravine through lava and subjacent gneiss to the depth of four hundred feet. On"], [35, "Ch.

The gravel again rests upon gneiss, which has been eroded to the depth of fifty feet. It is quite evident in this case, that while the basalt was gradually undermined and carried away by the force of running water, the cone whence the lava issued escaped destruction be- cause it stood upon a platform of gneiss several hundred feet above the level of the valley in which the force of running water was exerted. The brim of the crater of the Puy de Pariou, near Clermont, is so sharp, and has been so little blunted by time, that it scarcely affords room to stand on. This and other cones, in an equally remarkable state of integrity, have stood, I con- ceive, uninjured, not in spite of their loose porous nature, as might at first be naturally supposed, but in consequence of it. No rills can collect where all the rain is instantly absorbed by the sand and scori\u00e6.\" Lyell here acknowledges the denuding power of rain where it can collect in rills. But the porousness of volcanic cones is not the sole reason, nor even the main reason, why rain cannot col- c 4"], [36, "[Ch. II. 24 TERRACES OF GLEN ROY, lect on them. Their shape is the main reason. I endeavoured to show this in the second edition of the \"Tree-lifter.\" I will give one more homely illustration of the theory here. Suppose a building five yards square, with a roof like a shed, spouted. All the rain falls into five yards of spouting. Shape the roof like a gable, the same shed of rain is dispersed over ten yards of spouting. Shape the roof like a four-sided pyramid, the same shed of rain is dis persed over twenty yards of spouting instead of five. But cones and cairns have still greater power to disperse rain rills than flat-sided pyramids. And it is to their shape mainly that volcanic cones owe their comparative eternity. Com paratively eternal also is the truncation of their shape ; for this must remain till they are de nuded below the bottom of the crater \u2014 in many cases many hundred feet \u2014 they will then as sume the point and appearance of a simple cone of denudation.

But to aqueous down-pour myriads of them have yielded, and are yielding, and comparative eter nity is the most perennial claim which can be made to aught existing on a globe, the very being of every department of which, organic or inorganic, is dependent on perpetual change ; that is, on perpetual disintegration and repro duction. In fact the tendency of disintegration and the wash of rain is to form cones out of single hills, and ridges out of chains of hills, with pro jecting spurs, each spur being itself a ridge ending in a half cone ; and even these ridges are so studded with cones as to have a serrated or saw-like outline, and to have earned the modern Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian name of sierra or serra, and to have originated the Latin ex pression of perjuga montium, the very name of hills being taken from the yoke-like appearance of contiguous cones. And in this sense, rain may be said to form hills as well as valleys. For this reason, though as Sir Humphry Davy finely remarks, no work of a mortal can be im mortal, those works of man which approach nearest to immortality are cones, \u2014 the pyramid, the tumulus, and the cairn. Why do the im ber edax and the fuga temporum pass with so"], [38, "[Ch. n. 26 TERRACES OF GLEN ROY, Cliffs on the Seine not marine, light a touch over these ? Because they begin with a form which others end in, \u2014 a form which is not deformed even by disintegration and the wash of rain. Cones are the squares into which nature throws solids to resist the rush of aqueous down-pour. Rain, agglomerated in a steep hollow, is Napoleon's condensed column of at tack, irresistible save to the Iron Duke. The precipices and columns of chalk which stand out abruptly from the sloping banks of the Seine in Normandy, which Lyell considers as remnants from the surrounding denudation of the sea, exist only, because being harder than the neighbouring chalk, they have yielded more slowly to atmospheric disintegration and the wash of rain. Their comparative hardness is probably owing to the effect of the infiltration of water of petrifying power. Nature is a great chemist, and always at work. Air and water together are her great disintegraters, neither of them smgly. In dry air alone perish able materials will remain unaltered for cen turies, nay, thousands of years ; and under water wood will retain the sharp edges of the car penter's work for ages after the upper parts have been turned to powder under the action of the two powers. And it is astonishing to what"], [39, "Ch. II.] 27 AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE. a depth below the surface these two powers to gether will alter even the hardest rocks. They decay into soft mud, earth, clay, or sand. This happens on the surface. We see it and believe it. Some of us are rather hard of belief that these soft substances should become hard again under the surface ; that is, unless melted by heat or at least baked by heat like a brick. Yet the transformation of the soft into the hard without heat goes on under our eyes in nature and art daily. In art stucco, concrete, cement, plaster, and mortar, are daily formed. In nature petri fying springs turn the softest materials to the hardest in a few hours. Many springs deposit pure flint or limestone. The enormous areas over which water impregnated with iron has acted as a cement may be seen by the red and yellow colouring of strata. Place a piece of iron in sand exposed to the elements, and it forms a mass of stone. By the action of heat the purest looking water daily encrusts our ket tles and cauldrons with intensely hard stone.

And this is the true history of all de nudation. These taluses are of very constant occurrence, as I stated in the second edition of the \" Tree-lifter,\" and may be shown where they do occur, because they are unstratified. But what formed them but subaerial denuda tion ? Or in plain English, the decay of the faces of the precipices, or \" the run of the hills \" above them, or both. In general the philosophic and the unphilo sophic are terribly put out by the powers here claimed for \" the wash of rain.\" Yet when the word \" flood \" is used, they will allow you to wash away articles of any size or description, natural or artificial.

Lyell thinks that the pink tertiary strata did not join over the chalk, because they may have been deposited from his favourite marine de nudation after the chalk was raised. He writes : \" This idea receives some countenance from the fact of the tertiary strata, at their junction with the chalk and the London and Hampshire basins, often consisting of dense beds of sand and shingle, as the Addington hills, near Croydon.

This subject, under the head of drift and alluvium, will be considered in the thirteenth chapter. But as mistakes are constantly made between drift, alluvium, and tertiary strata, and as it is perhaps impossible strictly to distinguish between them, I will state here the sense to which I shall endeavour to confine myself when I use the words. Drift is coarser alluvium, shoved along the surface by strong floods, and deposited on land, or left in valleys, where the finer materials have been washed away, in both cases unstratified. Alluvium is finer drift, par- tially stratified, deposited on land, from materials held in suspension by water running or standing for a time. The deposits of alluvial plains are alluvium, though enormous quantities of drift may be mingled with them. Tertiary strata are deposits from water in water ; but so are all new alluviums in the sea and in lakes. Nay, in lakes the deposits near the shores partake"], [47, "Ch. ILL] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 33 very much of the character of drift, beyond this of alluvium, and in the centre they are perfectly stratified. Where are we to draw the line in these cases ? and especially where are we to draw the line between new alluvium in the sea and tertiary strata ? There is, however, a clear line between deposits on land and deposits in water; and to deposits on land I confine the words drift and alluvium. The enormous beds of drift and alluvium deposited on land, con tiguous to river-courses, and resulting from the formation of valleys, &c, are constantly quoted as tertiary strata. I contend, however, that the lips of the pink tertiary strata must have joined over the chalk, making these strata of the London basin and the Hampshire basin continuous over the Wealden ridge. The Alton hills, which form the west border of the Wealden region, are still capped with the last remains of tertiary strata. And doubtless the so-called Druidical sandstones and conglomerates of this otherwise chalk district are remnants of these tertiary beds. In the horse monument at the foot of Brook wood Hill, I brought the largest of the sand stones from the top of the clay-capped chalk ridge north of the road between East and West Meon. The next largest flat one I dug out from D"], [48, "34 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. III. two feet below the surface of the drift-gravel on the east side of Bramdean. It may, perhaps, have never moved horizontally, or very slightly, but have been gradually and constantly under mined during the excavation of the valley, and so let vertically down. A large stone so situated may be rounded by the passage of water, sand, and small stones in floods, and by the action of the atmosphere, and so assume the form of a huge boulder without having been itself moved. And where extensive regions of soft strata vanish by denudation, they will leave any accidental rocks or hard parts of their contents behind them in the form of huge boulders. To illustrate this in a small way : the drift at the bottom of one of our Hampshire deans or valleys may contain a sifted assortment of the contents of the whole mass which once was above the valley, as well as \" the run of the hills \" which now form its sides ; so that, of two flints there lying in contact, one may be tertiary, and the other secondary. A large sandstone may be seen in the cutting for the road on the brow of Filmere Hill, be tween West Meon and Alton, with perhaps fifteen feet of clay above it. This is no bunch of clay, but extends on all sides, except where valleys interfere. Indeed, I think it may be traced on the tops of the hills from the London to the"], [49, "Ch.

At any rate, it extends in the direction of Froxfield, where many other such stones protrude from the clay, to the very border of the Wealden region. Between Rotherfield and Alton, in Brightstone (Bridestone) Lane, is a collection of large con glomerate stones. The chalk hills of the opposite coast of France Tertiary strata and Belgium, and the banks of the Seine in Nor- united the n basins of Lon mandy, are also still undenuded of their cap of don, Paris, and Hampshire. tertiary strata ; and, according to my view, it is very probable that these strata of the Paris, the London, and the Hampshire basins once united over the chalk. But as we may almost say that the Weald is at the present time surrounded by tertiary strata, there is, I think, every presump tion that in former times these strata covered this \" valley of denudation,\" as Lyell calls it. A more complete misnomer, however, could not \" The weaid valley\" no val be. Every valley, indeed, is a valley of denu- ley but a hm, dation ; which denudation has passed out of the valley through a single outlet or watershed. For it is an essential characteristic of valleys, trunk or branch, that however infinite the tracery, and however countless the number of their ramifying upper inlets, each and every valley can have but one lower outlet. I speak as regards the flow of water and of denudation. D 2"], [50, "DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch.

III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 37 and its denu dation passes to two seas by nu merous distinct trunk valleys. But the Weald is no valley at all. If it is any one thing, it is the reverse of a valley. It is a hill with, if not a quaquaversal dip, at least a quaquaversal watershed ; that is, its watershed and denudation, like those of most other lar*_;e hills, are carried to the sea by a great number of distinct trunk valleys. And actually half of the valleys of this \" valley of denudation \" dis charge themselves into the English Channel, and the other half into the Thames and German Ocean. No one can cast his eye on the foregoing map, taken from Lyell's \" Elements,\" without seeing this fact. But I add Mr. Martin's own particular sketch to show how, according to him, the \" Weald valley \" consists of the very top of the \" Forest Ridge ; \" the exact summit which sepa rates the north and south watersheds, and which it is the present fashion to call a portage. And if anything can be the exact reverse of a valley, a portage is the exact reverse of a valley. The Humboldtian Keith Johnston explains the meaning of the word portage. Navigators have there, he tells us, \" the advantage \" of being obliged to carry their vessels, as well as their cargoes, overland from the river on one side of the portage to the river on the other side. D 3"], [52, "[ch. in. 38 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS These valleys were made by rain and rivers. lot by the sea. But whether the Weald hill was originally capped with tertiary strata or not, it is allowed by all that it was capped by the beds which I have enumerated from the chalk to the Hastings sand, and that these beds have vanished by denudation. Therefore, before this prodigious denudation took place, and while it was taking place, the ridge above the \" Forest Range \" was incomparably the highest ground in the region. Naturally, then, the watershed, whether of the surface (rain and snow), or from under the sur face (springs and rivers), would be from this highest point, the Forest Ridge, to the lowest point, the sea. And this watershed is not only to the north and south, as represented by Mr. Martin ; it is to the east and west also. From Tilgate Forest there is a quaquaversal water shed to the sea, by means of many different trunk valleys, formed and graduated by the wash of rain. And the courses of this watershed once made would be continued during the rise of the land, notwithstanding that, owing to a cause which will be explained, their starting-point might have been denuded some feet lower, not than their beds, but than the heights through which their beds pass. That the main drainage of the Forest Ridge does pass through the North and South Downs, which are masses of uniform"], [53, "Ch.

The sea could not have made them unless their original contents had been softer than their sides. Mr. Martin, indeed, points out that the four southern rivers are exactly opposite the five northern rivers. And Mr. Hopkins proves, \" by mathematical methods,\" that \" cross fractures \" must have occurred where these nine rivers pass through the Downs. And Lyell agrees, that, owing to the loosening of the materials, the sea has been enabled to make the nine river-courses. But, first, any two points are opposite one another. But if we take the tortuous lines of the rivers, they are oppositer ; for they are op posite all the points of the compass. And as for the eight or nine \" cross fractures,\" there is not a particle of evidence for the existence of any one of them. \" The pressure of superincumbent strata of unknown thickness and kind, must also be taken into account ; and it will not be thought won derful that diluvial action and the operation of more modern causes apart, there shoidd be so little direct evidence of fissure upon the surface.\" Mr. Martin here talks of little evidence ; but he actually produces none whatever.

It may be asked, Why then waste time on the ravings of mad ness ? and I beg pardon for doing so. But the reply is, that in discussing the theory of rivers and the formation of valleys, the opinions of Humboldt cannot be passed in silence, and par ticularly when (alas !) we find Lyell sharing in those opinions. Humboldt writes (\" Cosmos, Physical Geo graphy\"): \"The main direction of the whole continent of Europe (from south-west to north east) is opposite to that of the great fissures which pass from north-west to south-east, from the mouths of the Rhine and the Elbe, through the Adriatic and Red Seas, and through the mountain system of Putschi-koh, in Luristan, towards the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean.

III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 43 On whichever side of high land the sea is, the ivatershed must go to it. This is the sole and simple secret of the direction of rivers and val leys. And the principle applies to the inland seas and lakes of central Asia, as well as to the great oceans. If the sea is close to high land, as the Pacific to the Andes, an infinity of small streams run straight to it. If distant, as the Atlantic, the infinity of small streams, in seeking the sea, fall together, and form large rivers, col lecting as they go the watershed of the regions through which they pass. Thus a long river is a strong river, because vires acquirit eundo, and it gets wider as it descends. But if river-courses were igneous cracks formed in the elevation of the land, these cracks of construction should get narrower as they descend, and they should die off to nothing at the sea. The crack of the River Plate is 170 miles wide at the sea ; and, like all other rivers, instead of widening, as an igneous crack ought, it narrows as you proceed inland. I do not know what the width of the crack ofthe Amazons is at the sea, but it is three or four miles wide at the foot of the Andes, and there narrows to a few hundred yards.

Perhaps Mr. Hopkins will \" account for this by mathematical methods.\" But if we consider the entire head of the Amazons as one \" great fissure \" a thousand miles wide, how comes this fissure to be filled with the highest mountains of the New World ?

As every continent is surrounded by sea, any two rivers running from any height to opposite seas must form a \"great fissure,\" if we may jump the height. If we trace any two rivers from opposite seas, to where they nearly meet at their sources, we come to a portage. Are a portage and a fissure synonymous ? I should say that a portage is the reverse of a fissure. It is at least the highest ground in the neigh bourhood, if not on the continent. I am, however, straining at a gnat in not swallowing these superficial transverse fissures, which pass over and across mountain-tops. Now for the camel. Humboldt has seen so far into the millstone as to discover that every moun tain-chain is supported by a longitudinal fissure below it. In talking of earthquakes, he says : \"As mountain-chains appear to be raised on fissures, the walls of the cavities may perhaps favour the direction of undulations parallel to them.\" The great mountain fissure of the New"], [60, "[Ch.

If ther mometers were sunk at intervals of 1000 miles through this fissure into the interior of the earth, we might arrive at valuable isogeothermal (Chthonisothermal) facts. The experiment might be first tried at the plain of Malpais, which, with Mount Jorullo at its centre, 1600 feet high, was raised by eruption in 1759. Humboldt \" attributed the convexity of the plain to inflation from below; supposing the ground, for four square miles in extent, to have risen up in the shape of a bladder to the elevation of 550 feet above the plain in the highest part.\" Or at home we might try it on the Weald hill, where, owing to denudation, we must be near the \" fissure \" of construction, or perhaps in this case the foundation would be another \" bladder.\" But to return to the superficial fissures of the Weald. Of the Arun it may be said, that one of its arms runs from east to west ; another from west to east ; and its body from north to south. We cannot, then, deny that this river is opposite whatever river Mr. Martin pleases. Indeed, I am willing to concede that any one of the myriads of valleys branching from the Forest Ridge, or from the North or South Downs,"], [61, "Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 47 or from the Alton Hills, is opposite to any other which Mr. Martin pleases ; though I should hesitate to agree that any of these valleys re sulted from fractures, cross or longitudinal. The western branch of the Arun (called the Rother \u2014 not that Rother flowing from the Forest Ridge eastward) rises at Nore Hill, near Rotherfield, in Hampshire. So does one branch of the Wey. And these two rivers have nothing to do with the drainage of the Forest Ridge, but merely receive the run of the south side of the North Downs, and of the north side of the South Downs, and so develope these two ridges behind the gorges ; an operation which will be alluded to at the end of this chapter. I presume that Mr. Martin will have some fracture, \u2014 either a longitudinal fracture, or a cross fracture, or a diagonal fracture, \u2014 for the little stream which rises near East Meon, above the P. of Petersfield in the map. It surely is opposite the eastern arm of the Arun, or the western and the eastern Rother, and forms a \"great fissure\" in the same line, and directly along the anticlinal axis of the Weald valley. Or else it is opposite one of the branches of the Wey, or else one ofthe tributaries of the Thames above Odiham. However wedded I may be to my own theory, I cannot deny facts ; and Mr."], [62, "48 [ch. m. DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS Martin has only to say which of these rivers is opposite to this stream, and I can no more gain say it than I can object to the conclusions drawn by Mr. Hopkins's \" mathematical methods.\" Though I must say that I think that if Nature had drawn the lines of valleys by \" mathematical methods,\" she would have ruled them straighter than Britannia rules the waves, or than the lines of actually existent valleys are. In Norway and Sweden, raised beaches show that the land is rising for the space of about 1000 miles. These beaches are found 600 feet above the sea. The present rate of rising is thought to be four feet in a century. If this had caused \" fissures \" or \" cross fractures,\" they should not only be existing now, but greatly widening. Yet there are no more fissures there than in any other system of valleys. It is need less to remark, that a rise of four feet in a cen tury would in no way disarrange the drainage of the country. And it has required all the sa gacity of the greatest philosophers to ascertain that this vast operation has taken place, and is still progressing. I must confess that I have not had an oppor tunity of examining these \" mathematical me thods \" of Mr. Hopkins's. But according to my mathematics, if the valleys of the river-courses"], [63, "Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 49 of the Weald are igneous fissures, they should grow wider as they ascend. They should be widest at the top of the Forest Ridge, and should narrow off to nothing at the sea on the south, and at the Thames on the north, and this ir respective of comparative hardness of ground. The reverse of this is the case. Like any other Avatershed, these valleys start without any fis sures at all ; that is, the run of the whole surface of the high grounds is first received into an in finity of coombs, which have no permanent streams; and all these coombs, running from every direction, slope into a multiplicity of narrow valleys with rivulets, also running in every di rection. And, like any other watershed or system of valleys, instead of narrowing, they widen as they descend, except where the ground is harder than the ground above it, that is, up stream of it. The reason for this will be given immediately. Lyell says : \" It is evident that these openings, so far at least as they are due to aqueous erosion, have not been produced by the rivers, many of which, like the Ouse, near Lewes, have filled up arms ofthe sea,\" instead of deepening the hollows which they traverse,\" As these rivers have filled up arms of the sea, I have given a reason why they never can deepen their channels at the mouths as long as the sea E"], [64, "50 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. III. The sea is eroding the coast of Sussex, and land keep their present relative level. More than this : instead of deepening their channels, they will build their banks and beds up higher than they are, as the rivers in alluvial parts of valleys always must at every overflow. But this subject will be considered in the last chapter. According to Lyell the sea is at present erod ing the coast of Sussex. The following is from the \" Principles.\" \" About a mile to the west of the town of Newhaven the remains of an ancient entrenchment are seen on the brow of Castle Hill. This earthwork, supposed to be Roman, was evidently once of considerable extent, and of an oval form, but the greater part has been cut away by the sea. The cliffs, which are undermined here, are high ; more than 100 feet of chalk being covered by tertiary clay and sand from 60 to 70 feet in thickness. In a few centuries the last vestiges of the plastic clay formation on the southern borders of the chalk of the South Downs on this coast will be anni hilated, and future geologists will learn, from historical documents, the ancient geographical boundaries of this group of strata in that di rection. On the opposite side of the estuary of the Ouse on the east of Newhaven harbour, a bed of shingle, composed of chalk flints, derived from the waste of the adjoining cliffs, had ac-"], [65, "Ch.

In the great storm of November, 1824, this bank was entirely swept away, and the town of Sea ford inundated. Another great beach of shingle is now forming from fresh materials. \" The whole coast of Sussex has been inces santly encroached upon by the sea from time im morial; and although sudden inundations only, which overwhelmed fertile or inhabited tracts, are noticed in history, the records attest an ex traordinary amount of loss. During a period of no more than eighty years there are notices of about twenty inroads, in which tracts of land of from twenty to four hundred acres in extent were overwhelmed at once.\" With this devastation going on in these Aays, one would suppose that if in former days the sea made the valleys of the Ouse and the many other rivers in its neighbourhood, if it did not continue to erode and enlarge these valleys, it would at least keep them open. But the sea erodes the outside of the land, not the inside of it. Instead of eroding the inside, the sea, which is devouring the outside of the land, has allowed the rivers to dam it out of the inside of it, to fill up arms of the sea. And with what materials have the rivers filled these arms E 2"], [66, "52 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch.HL The gradient of a valley is never permanent in any part. of the sea, since they have not \" produced the openings,\" and are not \" deepening the hollows which they traverse ? \" But parvis componere magna: let us ask this question on a larger scale. If the sea made the valleys of the Rhone, Po, Mississippi, Ganges, and Niger, why does it yield to these rivers now, and allow them to protrude deltas of thousands and thou sands of square miles ? One answer replies to both questions. Though the Ouse must cease to deepen its channel where it is level with the sea, at this present time there is not a heavy rain falls on the upper valley of the Ouse, but it deepens, lengthens, and widens that valley. And this is the case, not only with that valley and the valleys which I have enumerated, but with every valley in the wide wide world. And hence the materials which fill arms of the sea, and form alluvial plains and deltas, unless the land is rising, or alongshore currents and tides inter fere by sea, or lakes catch the alluvium by land. The gradient of a valley is never permanent in any part. Every valley is always lengthening at the upper end or decreasing in height there ; and all intermediate parts are perpetually in process of being planed down, or built up to one uniform gradient from the head of the valley to"], [67, "53 Ch. HI.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. How rivers run through ridges of hills even without pond ing, as in the Weald. its mouth, or to the end of the delta, if there be one. Valleys are always increasing, hills always decreasing. Indeed, valleys exist only in the dissolution of hills. But sedimentary strata are not formed only from the contents of valleys. The entire surface of the solid part of the globe, the earth, is always being washed by rain into the liquid part of the globe, the sea. We are not to imagine that it is in the Weald only that rivers run through ridges of hills. A glance at a physical map of England or the World, will show plenty of examples. Is Mr. Hopkins going to account for these \" cross fractures \" by \" mathematical methods ?\" A stream running through ridges, large or small, is the simple consequence of the differing hardness of the ground through which it runs. In all cases a stream cuts for itself a narrow channel, the depth of which is determined by the hardest part. For a stream cannot run down where its bed is soft, and up again where it is hard. But the wash of rain digs down where the ground is soft, and leaves hills or ridges where it is hard. And as a stream cuts through a hard stratum, the wash of rain is scooping out two lateral valleys behind it, that is, a valley behind each side of the gorge and ridge. E 3"], [68, "54 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. IH. Such are the valleys along which the western branches of the Arun and Wey flow. But in this small map only large streams are marked. The debris of these valleys is carried off by the lowering bed of the river. A ridge is then developed, and the river runs through a gorge in the ridge. In this sense the wash of rain may be said to form hills as well as valleys, since by abstracting intervening masses it develops them. And in forming a statue, what does the artist do more ? These gorges, cut through comparatively hard beds or ridges, form the exceptions to the widen ing of valleys as they descend. The great height of some of these ridges, though a proof, is a very inadequate measure of the enormous denudation which has gone on behind them, since the ridges themselves have suffered enormous denudation. The tops of all such ridges must originally have been lower than the hills from which the rivers rise. But whether all or any of them continue lower, and their comparative height one with the other, will depend simply on which is the hardest, that is, which is most quickly disinte grated and denuded. The hills from which the rivers rise might be denuded as low as the beds of the rivers in the gorges."], [69, "Ch. in.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 55 The \" Weald valley \" may become \" the oolitic valley. Suppose this to happen in the Weald. The Forest Ridge of Hastings sand might then become a marsh, on an oolitic bed ; and \" the Weald valley,\" \"the oolitic valley.\" It is not likely that it would then feed more than one outlet ; but if it still retained its present ten outlets (for I consider the eastern Rother as one), I will make this possible valley with ten outlets a present to those who object to my definition of a valley. These causes produce a comparatively uni form slope of the bed of a river to the sea, with every species of irregularity of its banks, and the region through which it flows. This is the very fact which proves the aqueous origin of the river beds and valleys, as has been finely re marked by Playfair on Hutton. It is impos sible that earthquakes should have formed these continuous slopes to the sea through every different height of banks \u2014 this wonderful regularity passing through this wonderful irre gularity.

Yet as each illustrates one of two modes in which nature drives her rivers across and through ridges of hills, I shall consider the two as one subject in two chapters. Lyell writes of the valleys of the Weald hill : \" If these transverse hollows could be filled up, all the rivers,\" observes Mr. Conybeare, \" would be forced to take an easterly course, and to empty themselves into the sea by Romney Marsh and Pevensea Levels.\" To this we may add"], [71, "57 Ch.

For if the English Channel were filled up, and if the North and South Downs ran across it, and joined the chalk borders of the Seine, the waters of the Weald would help the Seine to drown Paris. And if Hampshire and the banks were high enough, and \" all the transverse hollows in France could be filled up,\" the rain which falls on Nore Hill would run through the railroad tunnel above Dijon, and so by the Saone and Rhone to the Mediterranean.

But now, after having abused the ifs of others, I will have an if of my own, or rather in conjunction with Lyell. He himself shows us that this lake, and all the American lakes are at this instant quietly in process of becoming dry valleys, without any violence, or any catastrophe, or any cataclysm ; that's the word, because people would understand you if you used the word flood. In direct con tradiction to his own theory that all valleys are formed by submarine denudation, he says (\" Prin ciples \"), \" The falls of Niagara afford a magnifi cent example of the progressive excavation of a deep valley in a solid rock.\" The cataract is now 165 feet in height. \"When it began to recede, it must have had nearly twice its present height.\" Say 300 feet. Lyell thinks that the river forms this gorge at the rate of one foot in a year, and would therefore have taken 35,000 years to form the present seven miles. Mr. Bakewell allows a yard a year, reducing the period to below 12,000 years. There are yet fifteen miles of gorge to make before the river begins to let off Lake Erie. Now here is a grand if If, 50,000 years"], [73, "Ch.

And in the very ' Principles ' which you quote, you have ventured on mathematical earthquakes of your own, in Italy.

IV. 60 Lyell contra- dicts himself on this subject. \" The Anio flows through a deep irregular fissure or gorge in the Apennine limestone, which may have been caused by earthquakes. In this deep narrow channel there existed many small lakes, three of which have been destroyed since the time of history, by the erosive action of the torrent, the last of them having remained down to the sixth century of our era.\" And indeed it is hard to see, if the \" fissure or gorge \" of the Niagara is of aqueous formation, why the \" fissure or gorge \" of the Anio should be of igneous formation. For in both cases there is the same cause, a river, working on the same material, limestone, producing the same effect, levelling the dams of lakes. \" I shall not deny what I have printed,\" said Lyell, \" nor can you ; and you will allow that, however often I have taken one side of this question, I have equally often taken the other. For instance, page 255 : ' If we ascend, for example, the valley through which the Dranse flows, we find that it consists of a succession of basins, one above the other ; in each there is a wide expanse of flat alluvial lands, separated from the next basin by a rocky gorge, once evidently the barrier of a lake.

The examination of almost all valleys in mountainous districts affords similar proof of the obliteration of a series of lakes by the filling up of hollows, and the cutting through of rocky barriers, a process by which running water ever labours to produce a more uniform declivity.\" \" There ! \" said Lyell, \" I am right either way ; for my sword cuts both ways.\" In Mr. Hopkins's quick reply, the words were heard, \"better a sword should cut only the right ivay.\" But Mr. Martin and Humboldt interposing, adjourned the debate to that day 50,000 years. I have said that the denudation of the Weald and that of the valley of the St. Lawrence each illustrates one of two opposite ways in which nature works the same effect, namely, the driving rivers through ridges which cross their courses. It must be confessed, however, that to level and perfect the watershed of the line of American lakes is a more difficult job than to make that of the Weald. For in the Weald the water has always worked from above, on soft materials, and with any number of streams, while the St. Lawrence has had, single-handed, an up-hill work, through the very hardest materials. It has had to fill the lakes before it could erode the lowest part of their brims."], [76, "THE ST. LAWRENCE WILL RUN [Ch. IV. 62 The American lakes are being laid dry by rain. But though water cannot flow up hill, it can by ponding flow over hills, and so cut channels through hills, and this, as Lyell says, is a very universal process in nature. This universal process is, however, directly opposed to the submarine theory. Truth, if not always, is at least often para doxical, and paradoxical as it may appear, it is nevertheless true, that rain and rivers are laying dry these, the largest bodies of fresh water in the world. And that by a double process also paradoxical. First, by filling them with allu vium. Second, by emptying them by eroding their barriers. With regard to the first cause, the filling them in, Lyell says, \" the streams which discharge their waters into Lake Superior are several hundred in number, without reckoning those of smaller size. On the northern side, which is encircled by primary mountains, the rivers sweep in many large boulders with smaller gravel and sand, chiefly composed of granite and trap rocks.\" The more central deposits consist of \" finer mud \" and \" adhesive clay.\" With regard to the second cause, the emptying of the lakes by the erosion of their barriers, that this is going on, is proved by parallel terraces, marking their former levels far above their"], [77, "Ch. IV.] THROUGH RIDGES BY PONDING. 63 This will happen without any apparent change. present levels. A depth of fifty feet has been thus taken from the surface of Lake Superior, which is nearly 2000 miles in circumference. This again, like the parallel roads of Glen Roy, is an example of lateral denudation which may be seen. Yet this great actual change has been worked without any apparent change. That is, this vast bulk of water has passed through the single outlet at St. Mary's, without causing the smallest symptom of flood at any former time, any more than the same process does at this instant. For the increase of the outflow is graduated by the decrease of the barrier, the gradualness of which we cannot even form a notion of. Indeed, the actual course of much more sudden changes than this is quite imperceptible to us. If a man never has an illness from eight years old to eighty, he suffers much alteration in the time ; yet at no one instant is he aware of the change which is continuously taking place in his organisation. With regard to the inorganic world, eternal gradual change is to finite beings like man, the same as no change at all. So that when, for beneficent purposes, instead of eighty years, God ordains that geological causes should take 80,000 years to work their effects, man disbelieves that any change is occurring, or that any change can"], [78, "THE ST. LAWRENCE WILL RUN [Ch. IV. 64 occur from such insignificant causes. The lake, however, will become dry land by the meeting of two opposite effects of the same, so thought insignificant, cause \u2014 rain. That is, by the raising of the bottom and the sinking of the top of its waters. Man will then gain a fertile tract, whose area is nearly equal to that of England. And be the transmutation of water into land ever so quick, or ever so slow, no \" boundary question \" can arise. During the operation and for ever, water will always separate Canada from America, John from Jonathan ; may we not rather say that water will always unite them. But this gift will be as subject to change as are all those which we receive from our Al mighty Creator. The erosion of the barrier at St. Mary's will still continue. The vast alluvial flat will be diversified with hills and valleys, and all the sedimentary beds will be taken away by the same cause which deposited them \u2014 rain \u2014 as is going on now in the ancient lakes of Auvergne. The St. Lawrence will then fill its estuary, and form an alluvial plain on it, of which the present cliffs will be equivalent to \" the bluffs \" of the alluvial plain of the Mississippi, and beyond this a delta will be protruded. It is possible that the St. Lawrence may be still forming its estuary. Lyell says, that"], [79, "Ch. IV.] THROUGH RIDGES BY PONDING. 65 \" horizontal banks of recent shells appear at various heights, from ten to one hundred feet above high water mark, and inland beaches of sand and shingle, with similar shells, as also elevated limestone rocks, scooped out by the waves, and showing lines of lithodoinous perfora tions \u2014 facts which indicate most clearly the successive upheaving of the land, since the sea was inhabited by the existing species of testacea.\" Suppose the land to have risen 100 feet above the level of the sea. This would have given a constant rapid fall from the river's mouth to the sea, and the river would thus gain the power of lowering its bed. While this was going on, no delta could be formed. And where rivers have estuaries instead of deltas, it may possibly, in some cases, be owing as much to the rise of land as to the wash of marine currents. In the case of the St. Lawrence, for instance, if a delta had been in formation before the land rose, as it rose the river must have cut a channel through the delta to the depth of 100 feet.

The loss of the two ends of this southern barrier allows the escape of the watershed to the south. This is the origin of the Chines ; and if any one wants to see nature beginning new valleys, these chines are very pretty examples of the operation. The wash of rain from the north of the south chalk formed the eastern part of the bed of drift which overlies the Wealden from Atherfield to Brixton (Bridestone) Bay ; as the southern run of the north chalk has formed the western part of this bed, from Compton Bay to Brook Bay. In all the geological sections and accounts of this district that I have seen, the north chalk is designated as vertical, the south chalk as hori zontal. This is a great mistake. Equivalent parts of each have the same degree of dip ; though the dip of the north chalk is to the north west, and the dip of the south chalk to the south east. On the top of the north range the chalk is nearly horizontal ; but as we descend to the north side and foot of the hill, the beds are vertical. On the top of the south range, the chalk has a gentle dip to the south-east ; and but that the chalk which formerly clothed the south"], [81, "Ch.

If these beds were not vertical, we must suppose that the elevation of the anticlinal axis of the Wealden produced one mechanical effect on the north side and a contrary mechanical effect on the south side, which is absurd. We can see that the south-east dip of the lower cretaceous beds from Atherfield to beyond Rocken End, is equivalent to the north-west dip of these beds from Compton Grange towards Freshwater. If the upper bed of chalk did not dip also, we must suppose that it was deposited unconformably on the lower cretaceous beds, which is also absurd. When chalk is horizontal the flints are pressed between two beds softer than themselves. When it is vertical each layer of flint presses on itself ; and. if the chalk has a slight power of yielding to pressure, and the flint absolutely none, these ribs of flint would become the main props of the weight of the entire mass. Is this the cause of the splintering of flints in vertical beds ? Were all layers of flints originally deposited in plates, which have been contracted into nodules in solidifying ?

Page 685., he enquires how far vegetation may \" retard the levelling effects of running water, which it cannot oppose, much less counter- balance. It is well known that a covering of herbage and shrubs may protect a loose soil from being carried away by rain, or even by the ordinary action of a river, and may prevent hills of loose sand from being blown away by wind ; for the roots bind together the separate particles into a firm mass, and the leaves intercept the rain water, so that it dries up gradually, instead of flowing off in a mass, and with great velocity. The old Italian hydrographers make frequent mention of the increased degradation which has followed the clearing away of natural woods in several parts Italy. A remarkable example was afforded in the Upper Val D'Arno in Tuscany, on the removal of the woods clothing the steep declivities of the hills by which that valley is bounded. When the ancient forest laws were abolished by the Grand Duke Joseph, during the last century, a considerable tract of surface in the Cassentina (the Clausentinium ofthe Romans) was denuded, and immediately the quantity of F 4"], [86, "72 [Ch.

Frisi, alluding to such occurrences, observes, that as soon as the bushes and plants were removed the waters flowed off more rapidly, and, in the manner of floods, swept away the vegetable soil. This effect of vegetation is of high interest to the geologist, when he is considering the formation of those valleys which have been principally due to the action of rivers. The spaces intervening between valleys, whether they are flat or ridgy, when covered with vege tation, may scarcely undergo the slightest waste, as the surface may be protected by the green sward of grass ; and this may be renewed, in the manner before described, from elements derived from rain-water and the atmosphere.

Rivers have the power to cut narrow channels or ravines ; but they have very little power of widening these. Disintegration and the wash of rain widen these ravines into broad valleys. While this is going on rivers convey to the sea what rain brings to them, which would other wise pass out of the valleys more slowly by the wash of rain. But rivers no more make the sediment which they carry than railroads manufacture the wares of which their traffic consists. The sediment carried by rivers is brought to them by rain, from the entire surface of their tributary ground, or watershed. Erosion of banks is an excep tional calamity. But heavy rain never happens, but it loads the rivers with mud. Nay, it loads the along-shore waters of the sea with mud. These are matters of fact, not matters of opinion. We \" need no ghost \" nor good eyes to ascertain them ; all we need good is the umbrella and macintosh, to enable us to go out and see.

Ocean not only instantly swallows all, but licks the platter clean. But in the same page Lyell is \" overtaken by a violent thunderstorm,\" near San Lorenzo in Spain ; and \" I saw the whole surface, even the highest levels of some flat-topped hills streaming with mud, while on every declivity the devas tation of torrents was terrific. The peculiarities of the physiognomy of the district were at once explained ; and I was taught that on speculating on the greater effects which the direct action of rain may once have produced on the surface of certain parts of England, we need not revert to periods when the heat of the climate was tropical.\" But why the words \" greater \" and \" once ? \" Why, if rain once denuded the surface in England, should it have ceased to do so now?

And in a thunderstorm, Lyell believed that even flat"], [89, "VAL D'ARNO. 75 Ch. V.] ground may be denuded by rain, which he seemed to doubt in the first part of the page. But I must say a word theoretically to those who may not have met with Lyell's practical proof. Most people are doggedly possessed of the idea that water will not flow on land which has no slope. But as rain falls from high Heaven, its only relief from rising on itself is to flow. Empty a decanter of water on the middle of the table. Does the water remain in the middle ? Introduce a pipe of running water to the middle of a flat stone hall. The water flows all over the flat pavement, and finally escapes from the hall by every door. Why ? Not because it flows without a fall, but because it rises on itself, and so makes a fall. \u25a0\" unda impellitur unda Urgueturque prior venienti urguetque priorem.\" As the tide flows tip the bed of every river twice every day, perhaps for the space of 100 miles, at the rate of twenty miles an hour, stop the pipe of supply and the hall will \" run dry ; \" continue the supply for ever, and a channel would be worn at each door, and from any two doors across the centre of the hall we should have one of Humboldt's \" great fissures,\" or Messi's. Martin's and Hopkins's \"cross frae-"], [90, "76 [Ch. V. LYELL ON THE tures.\" Nature drains and denudes every flat on earth on this principle, a channel being cut backward from wherever the water can escape, with a celerity directly as the softness of the soil. These channels become small valleys, and so the flat no flat, but hill and dale. We need no Jupiter Tonans, nor need we go to Spain to see that flat land is denuded by rain. There is a clay field near this house, so flat that no eye could foretell which way the water would run off it. Yet every heavy rain it discolours the whole of the stable pond with a co pious yellow stream, through an exit in the bank. No one can doubt in this case that rain denudes the flat field and deposits in the pond.* I have seen this happen when the field was covered with an excellent crop of clover two years old. So that the strong soil was not only \" matted together\" by roots, but the rain was \" broken in its fall \" by the leaves and stalks, which really were close enough to the ground to effect this, operations which Lyell alludes to thus in finish ing the page : \" In the Torrid Zone the degra- * Possibly one of the benefits of underdraining is that, besides letting off water which would stagnate, in the opera tion, the finer parts of soil are washed in instead of out.

V.] 77 dation of land is generally more rapid, but the waste is by no means proportioned to the superior quantity of rain, or the suddenness of its fall, the transporting power of water being counteracted by a greater luxuriance of vegeta- tion. A geologist who is no stranger to tropical countries, observes, that the softer rocks would speedily be washed away in such regions if the numerous roots of plants were not matted to- gether in such a manner as to produce consider- able resistance to the destructive power of the rains. The parasitical and creeping plants also entwine in every possible direction, so as to render the forests nearly impervious, and the trees possess forms and leaves best calculated to shoot off the heavy rains, which, when they have been broken in their fall, are quickly absorbed by the ground beneath, or when thrown into the drainage depressions, give rise to furious tor- rents.\" These are curious functions of the leaves. They first cause the rain to be \" quickly absorbed,\" and then \" give rise to furious torrents.\" But we may pass over small tri- butary contradictions when we are considering the four main channels of contradiction by which Lyell forms valleys.

Leaves collect the rain into infinitely larger masses than the natural rain-drop, and mechanically tear up the soil.

The umbrella will tell you as plain as it can speak of the increased size of the drops. If man removes the roots of woods for culti vation, on \"steep declivities\" like those of the Arno, his art preserves the soil by stone walls and terraces. Thousands, I might say millions of miles of this terrace work clothe the hill sides of the south, and this practical necessity affords the best possible practical proof ofthe truth ofthe theories which I advocate. When art has thus done her best greenly to flounce nature's garment to the highest, we often see above, long and deep ridges of grey, bald rock without a shrub. Yet, by the chemical action of the atmosphere and by the chemical and mechanical action of rain, this region, the picture of sterility in itself, is a constant source of the most fertile soil for the terraces of the hill side below. That soil does not stop there. It does not stop in the valley below. It does not stop even in the depths of the sea. From these depths it will be re elevated. \" The Spirit of God \" moves through the depths as well as \" on the face of the waters,\" and is present imo tollere de gradu, and each grain of soil which we have traced from the mountain top to the ocean's depth will move for ever in the grand circle of changes"], [94, "80 LYELL ON THE VAL D'ARNO.

Four different theories for the formation of valleys are not so many, but that Lyell must start a fifth for the formation of the great valley of Etna, the Val del Bove. He attributes its formation to subsidence. As he could not con veniently get the sea over Mount Etna, he forgets his submarine theory altogether, and simply fights against \" running water.\" \" Principles,\" page 396., he says : \" We cannot ascribe this valley to the action of running water ; for if it had been excavated exclusively by that power, its depth would have increased in the descent ; whereas, on the contrary, the precipices are most lofty at the upper extremity, and diminish gradually on approaching the lower G"], [96, "82 [Ch.

Does the height of the sides of the valley of the Mississippi increase, from the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of Mexico ? Does not the height of these sides vary in every part, without any reference whatever to the bed of the valley ? The height of the sides of the valley, or their comparative height at different places, has nothing to do with the question. The question is, does the bed of the valle}**, independently of interruption from modern lava streams, slope continuously to the sea ? as it does so, there is every presumption that this slope was graduated by water; and it would have required a miracle to have subsided in this form ; \u2014 that is, as Playfair remarks, it is as infinity to unity, that water must have graduated the descent ; the irregularity of the sides of mountainous valleys, contrasted with the regu larity of their beds, is the very fact which proves that valleys have been formed by the descent of water. For what other agent could have pro duced these marvellously regular slopes of bound less extent, in the midst of the most thoroughly irregular surfaces ? Besides this, if this valley had subsided, it would have subsided bodily. But there are certain rocks, Finocchio, Lepra, Capra, and Musara, which, owing to their hard-"], [97, "Ch. VI.] 83 VAL DEL BOVE. ness, have resisted disintegration and the wash of rain, and stand abruptly out of the bed of the valley. Of these rocks, Lyell, with much naivete remarks, \" Almost all the isolated masses in the Val del Bove, such as Capra, Musara, and others, are traversed by dikes, and may, perhaps, have partly owed their preservation to that circumstance, if at least the action of occasional floods has been one of the destroying causes in the Val del Bove ; for there is nothing ivhich affords so much protec tion to a mass of strata against the undermining action of running water as a perpendicular dike of hard rock.\" The precipitous sides of the valley are also scored throughout with an infinity of projecting dikes, or veins of injected lava. I call these as witnesses in my favour ; for I do not think that subsidence would have left these projections, but disintegration and wash of rain would. Lyell says of them : \" They consist of harder materials than the strata which they traverse, and therefore waste away less rapidly under the influence of that repeated congelation and thawing, to which the rocks in this zone of Etna are exposed.\" Now, though Lyell may not agree with me in thinking that these dikes prove the original form ation of the valley by waste, he here allows and shows that the prolongation and enlargement of g 2"], [98, "[Ch. VI. 84 LYELL ON THE the valley is at this instant going on by waste, precisely the same as they do in every other valley in the world. But though these dikes are witnesses of the waste, they are by no means measures of it ; for they are not only equally exposed with their softer neighbours to disin tegrating causes, but, from their projection, they are infinitely more exposed to these disintegrating causes. The head of every valley on a steep hill side forms, and must form, \"an amphitheatre, sur rounded on three sides with\" banks, if not preci pices, \" the loftiest being at the upper end, and the height gradually diminishing on both sides.\" Lyell says this of the Val del Bove, as if it was extraordinary, and peculiar to that valley. But if it were granted that this valley were formed by subsidence, is Lyell going to form all the other valleys of Etna by subsidence ? or, if not, how have they been formed, except by the wash of rain ? since they have confessedly never been under the sea. Lyell, indeed, says \" that running water in general exerts no power on Etna, the rain which falls being immediately imbibed by the porous lavas ; so that, vast as is the mountain, it feeds only a few small rivulets, and these even are dry throughout the greater portion of the year."], [99, "Ch. VI.] 85 VAL DEL BOVE. Why volcanic districts have weak springs and deep dry ravines. The enormous rounded boulders, therefore, of felspar, porphyry, and basalt, a line of which can be traced from the sea from near Giardini, by Mascali, and Zafarana to the Val del Bove, would offer a perplexing problem to the geologist, if history had not preserved the memorials of a tremendous flood, which happened in this district in the year 1755.\" This was from snow melted by an eruption. But is it possible that Lyell can attribute the line of boulders to this one historical accident ? In my opinion, the reason why volcanic districts have so few permanent springs, is the exact reverse of the reason given by Lyell. I think that the lava (I do not talk of cones of cinders) of these districts is generally so un- porous, that all rain is instantly shot off in the form of surface flood water. Besides, I think that the sort of dome-like, pent-house form, in which the coatings of lava are successively laid over volcanic districts, has a tendency to shoot water off the surface, and prevent its soaking in. And hence the depth of the dry ravines, and the weakness of the springs. If \" the rain which falls were immediately absorbed by the porous lavas,\" it would reappear in strong springs, streams, and rivers. But besides that in his account of the Val del G 3"], [100, "86 [Ch. VI. LYELL ON THE Bove, we have just seen that Lyell refers to \" the action of occasional floods ; \" a little after his first historical flood of 1755, he tells us of another historical flood in 1761. In this second historical flood, which arose from \" the fall of heavy rains, aided, probably, by the melting of snow,\" \"sixty ofthe inhabitants of Acicatena were killed, and many of their houses swept away.\" I wonder how many unhistorical floods pass down the valleys of Etna every year now, and how many millions have passed down them. I should guess that, while the snow is melting, streams must run from the head to the foot of Etna every year, for perhaps a hundred successive days and nights. But, besides the effects of general aqueous causes, is Etna free from the effects of its own particular local watering pot ? \u2014 from the lava d'acqua ? In describing Vesuvius, Lyell says, \" great floods of mud were as destructive as the lava itself \u2014 no uncommon occurrence during these catastrophes ; for such is the violence of rain produced by the evolutions of aqueous vapours, that torrents of water descend the cone (no porousness helps it here), and becoming charged with impalpable volcanic dust, and rolling along loose ashes, acquire sufficient consistency to deserve their ordinary appellation of \" aqueous lavas.\""], [101, "87 Ch. VI.] VAL DEL BOVE. In ancient times, Herculaneum and Pompeii were both overwhelmed by these floods of mud, as in modern times were St. Sebastian and Massa, so suddenly as to suffocate seven persons. \" It will, therefore, happen very frequently, that to wards the base of a volcanic cone alternations will be found of lava, alluvium, and showers of ashes.\" Herculaneum is \" covered not only by showers of ashes, but by alluviums and streams of lava,\" \" to a depth of nowdiere less than 70, and in many places of 112 feet.\" Lyell says of Torre del Greco : \" It seems probable that the destruction of three thousand of its inhabitants in 1631, which some accounts attribute to boiling water, was principally due to one of those alluvial floods which we before mentioned.\" But alluvium is not deposited anywhere without a corresponding denudation somewhere.

Indeed, I think that he should here be credited with a sixth theory ; for he here joins fire and water in a most unholy alliance against the devoted region. And the mode of action of the allied forces is quite distinct from their mode of action in the Weald. Chapter xxix., \"Principles,\" he considers \" how earthquakes contribute to the formation of valleys.\" But his earthquakes in Calabria are no longer \" mathematical earth quakes \" like those of the Weald. He does not crack out \" great fissures,\" forming a \" rectan gular intersection of geodesic lines,\" like Hum boldt, or fractures, \" longitudinal and transverse,\" like Messrs. Martin and Hopkins. He makes his regular approaches, indeed ; but on a system quite different from that employed in the Weald. He saps with water, and then springs his sub terranean mine. With the Mediterranean on one side, and the Adriatic on the other, he surely throws away a chance for the employment of his own submarine plan. And with the crest of the Apennines between these two seas, what an inexhaustible field for fissures, cracks, and portages ! But, no ; earthquakes and the erosion theory become the sole and sovereign specific for valley-making here. When taken to be well shaken ; that is,"], [104, "[Ch.

Lyell says (p. 466.), that \"the formation of valleys by running water can never be understood if we consider the question independently of the agency of earthquakes. It must not be imagined that rivers only begin to act when a country is * The great igneous authority, Humboldt, repeats the ancient vulgar error, that volcanoes are \" safety-valves \" against earthquakes.

Time must be allowed in the intervals between distinct convulsions for running water to clear away the ruins caused by landslips, otherwise the fallen masses will serve as buttresses, and prevent the succeeding earthquake from exerting its full power. The sides of the valley must be again cut away by the stream and made to form precipices and overhanging cliffs before the next shock can take effect. \" If a single convulsion of extreme violence should agitate at once an entire hydrographical basin, or if the shocks should follow each other too rapidly, the previously existing valleys would be annihilated instead of being modified and enlarged.

But it appears that the operation is much facilitated if from time to time the valleys are choked up by earthquakes ; or if the previously existing valleys should be annihilated, and \"every stream be compelled to begin its operations anew, and to shape out new channels, instead of continuing to deepen and widen those already excavated.\" Also that \" the action must of necessity be most powerful while the land is rising or sinking ; \" why, he neglects to inform us.

This would give the rivers more to do, if that is to make them more \" powerful.\" But how would a sinking make them more powerful ? With submission, neither Lyell nor earthquakes are likely to throw light on the subject ; and,"], [107, "93 Ch. VII.] VALLEYS OF CALABRIA. Lyell's subma rine theory does not apply] to volcanic islands. \" if we consider the question \" as dependent on \" the agency of earthquakes,\" \" the formation of valleys by running water can never be under stood.\" However, in the proper districts of earthquakes, in volcanic regions, Lyell is right to call in running water, or any agent to form his valleys. His own submarine theory will not apply to volcanic districts or islands, for their surfaces have been ejected over them when they were already above the sea ; and they have been coated and recoated thousands of times, by floods of melted rock when they had long been sub dio. Yet the gradients of the river valleys and dry valleys, and the whole form of the ridges and furrows ofthe entire surface drainage of a volcanic region (say Madeira), are so precisely the same as those of any other mountainous district, that no eye can glance over the two, and doubt for an instant that the same cause caused the form of the drainage of both. In Tenerife I have seen numberless cases of volcanic dikes which projected from the opposite sides of valleys, and ran across the streams in their beds at all angles ; and sometimes four or five dikes close to each other, and not parallel. The direction ofthe water-courses is never altered by these dikes, as is asserted by Keith Johnston. A dike simply retards the deepening of the"], [108, "94 [Ch. VII. LYELL ON THE ravine where the dike is, and that part of the ravine which is above it. The part below it will be deepened precisely as if the dike did not exist. But the part above must wait for the lowering of the dike, and the deepening will then go on backward; that is, from the dike towards the hill. When a dike runs diagonally across the main ravine, it of course does the same with the minor ridges and furrows, with which rain has scored the entire surface of the sides of each ravine. These minor ravines, however, run \" right up and straight down,\" regardless of the dike or Keith Johnston. This may be well seen from the aqueduct in the ravine north of Santa Cruz. We have only to look at a geological map, to see the incorrectness of Keith Johnston's remark, that rivers change the direction of their courses with every change of geological strata. These valleys of Tenerife are almost all dry, except in rain. The beds of the upper parts are sheer rock, the middle parts wear the appearance of torrents of stones, the lower beds are alluvial plains of stones, and opposite the mouths of these valleys are very commonly deltas and bars of stones. Behind these bars, after each rain, large deposits of earth and sand are formed, which the people diligently collect.

From the sides, hundreds or thousands of torrents of stones fall into these rivers of stones. Some- times these lateral shoots have formed barriers across the valley, behind which large beds of boulders and earth have accumulated, again to be thrust out by heavy longitudinal floods. In this case, I imagine that the overwhelming force of what the French call the debacle comes into play.

But without frost or snow, in all steep hollows and mountain torrents, the \" flood of outburst \" is of constant occurrence. The paving blocks of the beds of torrents catch floating rubbish, large and small, and form temporary dams and lakes. Away goes a block, which deepens the outlet some feet. Rock after rock follows, dashing itself and its neigh- bours below into pieces a tenth part of their former size.

Excepting White sand and shells, it is entirely composed of pebbles of quartz ; and, with out any vegetation, has the appearance of a line of white pearls across the blue sea.

But the area of aqueous denudation, or wash of rain, is still more universal than the area of vegetation.

Indeed, glaciers bring down their huge quota, ready ground for exportation by the torrents which they generate. According to Saussure, four of these main channels, or trunk lines of denuda tion, are continuous from the top of Mont Blanc, and from these the debris of \"the monarch of mountains \" are traced for great distances. That the beds of the valleys of glaciers suffer denudation like those of other valleys, I think we may infer for two reasons. First, the grooves or lines scratched on the sides of the valleys by the passage of the glaciers are discovered far above their present level. Next, if this were not so, there would be an abrupt break or step from the glacier valley to the valley in prolongation of it. Besides the moraines or heaps of undigested detritus deposited by glaciers at their lowest ends, the streams which issue from them are always loaded with mud. These streams are flooded in the spring and summer, when the snows melt to such a degree that, Saussure says, they raise the level of the Lake of Geneva six feet in that season.

That ice and snow must in crease at the poles is falla cious. however, enters the lake as muddy as possible, and leaves it as pellucid as possible. The same argument will prove that the parts of mountains covered with perpetual snow suffer aqueous denudation precisely the same as all other parts of the earth. For if not, along the lower line of snow we should find terraces the reverse of those of Glen Roy, and similar to some which I shall mention in the next chapter. That is, the terraces would be above the denuded parts instead of below them. Summer rains, and the melting of snow by summer suns, percolate the snow, and what does not enter the ground runs off it, and denudes it the same as if there were no snow. Though ice and snow perpetually surround the two poles, it is not the same ice and snow, any more than the snow on the mountain top or the water in the river Continues the same. And the idea that ice and snow must increase at the poles is fallacious. Every year thousands of enormous mountains, we might say continents, of ice (all bearing mud, earth, and stones) float off, and are melted in more temperate latitudes. The causes of increase or decrease of snow which may occur at the poles, are shown by a magnificent theory of the illustrious Lyell. h 3"], [118, "102 SEDGWICK'S DOCTRLNE THAT [Ch. VIII. Mountains while rising may be decreas ing in height. It does not follow that while mountains are rising they are increasing in height. They may be decreasing in height. Suppose the Alps to have been rising six inches in a century for myriads of years, if their denudation has been seven inches in a century, they have been de creasing in height. It is true that the direct action in waste and denudation of torrents and rivers is on lines only ; and were it not for the atmospheric dis integration and the lateral wash of rain this their direct action would only cut ravines and channels to the sea, and the sides of all valleys, instead of sloping, would be cliffs ; that is, where a spring issues high up the mountain side, it will cut a deep ravine with precipitous cliffs, and the deeper it cuts, the more springs it will lay open. But what widens this ravine into a broad valley with gently sloping sides ? The lateral wash of rain into the longitudinal valley. And what forms the broad valley, even where there is no river at the bottom ? or within many miles ?

It is indeed intermittent ; so is the real scooping force of the torrent, for torrents only really"], [119, "Cn. VIII.] DENUDATION IS ONLY ON LINES. 103 excavate when swollen by rain. A torrent swollen by rain to perhaps twenty times the volume of its usual spring water, and hurling fragments of rocks along of all sizes, is, in point of excavating and destructive power, as much more formidable than its usual self as a shotted gun is more formidable than an unshotted gun. We never see the clear torrent set its rocky am munition in movement, though the shape of this ammunition tells us how often, and for what distances, it has been projected. But when the torrent is turbid with the wash of rain, we can hear its huge cannon balls rattling down, and grinding each other and their rocky bed and banks, till what has started from the mountain's brow as a huge rock arrives at the sea in the form of pebbles or of sand. For although, as the flood of rain subsides, the flow of boulder stones ceases, this is only for a time ; each rain sets them on a stage on their journey, as, in lower levels and gentler gradients, will be seen of soil, and the more minute particles formed by disintegration and vegetable chemistry. And it is not only that districts of rocks are amply supplied with this ammunition which districts of softer subsoil are without ; but as rocky subsoils have little power to admit rain by absorption, it agglomerates in the ravines which h 4"], [120, "104 SEDGWICK'S DOCTRINE THAT [Ch. Vin. it finds ready loaded to the muzzle with loose rocks and boulders. And thus the longitudinal cutting of ravines proceeds in rocky mountains perhaps as rapidly as in softer subsoils. But the widening of these longitudinal ravines into broad valleys by disintegration and the lateral wash of rain is a process infinitely slow in comparison to what takes place in districts of softer sub soils. But as sure as dry land stands betwixt high heaven and the sea, the waters of heaven will wash it into the sea. And whether the dry land be of soft or of hard material simply makes the difference of the comparative time required for the operation. In soft and porous subsoils, as the tertiary and chalk, though nature does not make so much fuss about the affair, she proceeds equally surely. The top of the same Hampshire hill, which may be chalk capped with tertiary strata, is on one side moving to the German Ocean, through the medium of the Thames, and on the other side to the English Channel, by the Itchen, forming one of Humboldt's \"fissures,\" or Mr. Hopkins's \" fractures.\" From all sides of the tops of these hills, and from all sides of every height on the globe, there are dry river beds, down which soil flows whenever rain is heavy"], [121, "Ch.

No return tickets are given. It will wait there, and go on by the nex-t-rain. The very soil on which we tread, and which we cultivate, may be said to be on its road from the hill to the sea. Soil which is the disintegration or detritus of rocks (I use the term rocks in the wide geological sense) is in perpetual formation over the whole surface of the earth ; and from the whole surface of the earth it is in perpetual movement, by the wash of rain, to the bottom of the sea. This paragraph was scarcely printed in the second edition of the \" Tree-lifter,\" before I had an opportunity of seeing the surface water flow from the two sides of Filmere Hill, as I have"], [122, "SEDGWICK'S DOCTRINE THAT [Ch.

It stood on the high road at East Tisted more than a foot deep, nature's gradient being dammed up by the cross road of man. Over this, the water flowed into the Lavant from Farringdon, by Chawton and Maiden Lane, to the east of Alton, into the Wey and Thames. In following the high road from Tisted up the north-east side of Filmere Hill, I saw a continuous stream along the valley, running from near Ashen Wood. Where the valley was crossed by the new enclosures of West Tisted Common, the water was ponded back into lakes till it flowed over the small banks on which these fences stand. And (risum te neatis amici?) if left to nature precisely the same processes of filling up these lakes and cutting down their barriers would go on as have been described in the ancient lakes of Auvergne and in the valley of the St. Lawrence.

Aerial denuda. tion and de posit. through the Lavant, between there and Cheriton, to Tichborne and Southampton. The streams of these two usually dry trunk valleys were joined by very strong streams from their usually dry branch valleys. In such a case, where the surface of the ground is frozen hard, one would suppose that very little of the soil would be washed away ; yet whenever snow is drifted, be the ground ever so hard frozen, a great quantity of soil is drifted with it. \"White as the driven snow,\" is an expression as trite as it is poetical. But as the driven snow melts, its surface becomes anything rather than white. The melting snow percolates through itself in the form of water, and the whole of the soil, which is mingled with its entire bulk, is gradually accumulated on the surface, giving the drift the appearance of soil rather than of snow. And when the drift has entirely melted, a residuum of earth is deposited on the ground. If this aerial denudation and deposit of soil take place in drifts, I think it probable that aqueous denu dation may take place in rapid thaws, be the ground ever so hard frozen. In fact, neither wind nor water, under any circumstances, ever travels empty-handed. I once saw a remarkable example of aerial"], [124, "[Ch. VIII. 108 SEDGWICK'S DOCTRINE THAT deposit under circumstances the most adverse to it. In an attempt to ascend Mont Blanc, before our arrival for the night at \" Saussure's house,\" I counted in a rent, or crevasse, of a glacier which we passed, many years of snow. The top of each of these annual beds was clearly marked in black, and 1 think it quite probable that an aerial deposit takes place over the entire snowy surface of Mont Blanc. I need not remark that this portage of soil by wind must take place in all frosts, inde pendent of snow drifts. Though the effect of this widely operating cause will not be so ap parent as when its burthen \"violates the ingenuous snow.\" What is shoved along the bottom by water (for instance, shingle) is arrested on the near side of any obstacle, but what is held in sus pension in a stream is deposited on the farther side. And a comparatively small object, say a drifted tree grounded in a river, by causing a back-water or eddy, may form a huge mud bank or island below it, which may change the course of the river. It is very curious to remark the huge drifts of snow which very slight objects will collect on their leeward sides. But as the wind, unlike the stream, is constantly shifting to every quarter of the heaven, any collection"], [125, "Ch. Vin.] DENUDATION IS ONLY ON LINES. 109 of soil deposited by wind, instead of being con stantly added to, may be frequently despoiled. There are, however, some places, as the tops of bare hills, which are constantly denuded by wind, and others, such as woods, which are constantly enriched by wind ; and as they are free from aerial denudation the soil of woods is more than compensated even for the crops taken from them by man. A part of the products of vegetation may be said to be stored in the bodies of animals. And as carnivorous animals prey on the herbivorous, a part even in carnivorous animals, but the longest lived animals and plants, die, and their hardest parts decay ; so that, on the average, the entire mass of a year's growth of all terrestrial vegetation may be considered as taken annually from below the surface and annually deposited afresh above the surface. Much of the organic or combustible part of this growth goes into the atmosphere in the form of gases, to be returned again to the earth in rain. Of the inorganic or incombustible part, or what would be the ashes of plants and animals if burnt, much is washed into the earth by rain, much ploughed in as manure, much washed into the sea with other soil.

So in dry windy weather, when cultivated lands are thoroughly cleansed and broken finely for sowing, great quantities, even of soil, change places by wind, by which exposed spots are impoverished, and sheltered spots enriched. This denudation of soil is visible; so is the deposit of leaves. There are spots in which leaves are never allowed to rest, and others which every year catch large quantities. Ponds fill up even in man's short existence, and must be emptied if they are intended to serve as ponds. This happens whether ponds have a run of a stream through them, or a run of rain into them, or art prevents any run at all into them. In the last case aerial deposit will fill them, chiefly with leaves. But in all cases aerial deposit forms a great item in filling ponds."], [127, "Ch. IX.] 111 LYELL ON TnE GANGES.

And though all possible natural acci dents of this sort might have been supposed to have taken place long ago in all but volcanic or newly raised regions, Lyell, quoting Sir T. D. Lauder's account of the great floods in Moray shire, August 1829, says, \" Some new ravines were formed on the sides of mountains where no streams had previously flowed, and ancient river channels which had never been filled from time immemorial gave passage to a copious flood.\" And again, Lyell, in giving an account of the formation of new ravines by heavy rains on the"], [128, "112 [Ch.

And in the present day we may see ravines begun by the accidental results of many operations of man. A hedge or ditch, a pathway or waggon-way, may commence the furrow on the mountain's brow, nay, even on downs which are covered with the closest greensward ; and how many of our bye-roads and lanes become ravines ! Indeed, as the long conduits whose gradients are laid by the wash of rain, very generally become the roads or lines of traffic of man, so, vice versa,, the roads or lines of traffic of man, on or near declivities, very generally become conduits for the wash of rain. Hence our \" sunk lanes \" and \" sunk roads.\" In fact, the moment roads or lanes leave the line of the valley, the moment they cross the hills from one valley to the other, that moment they become more or less sunk roads. And this, \" more or less,\" depends on the steepness of the hills, without reference to comparative hardness : that is, the steeper the hill, the deeper the sinking of the road. The"], [129, "Ch. IX.] AND ON THE GANGES. 113 reason is, that roads on declivities are channels for the wash of rain, and they partake of the nature of narrow valleys or ravines. In pro portion as the surface of declivities is hard and unporous, the wash of rain and its power accumulate ; so that, although declivities whose surfaces are soft are from this reason more easily abraded, by their porousness, which is generally a consequence of their softness, they are to a certain extent protected from denudation. That a foundation of the hardest rock will not support these modern gangways of man, witness the high cliffs on the sides of each Devonshire sunk lane. When a road follows the centre of a dry upper valley with a fence on each side, it very generally becomes \" sunk.\" And this appearance is in creased by the fences stopping the wash of soil to the centre of the valley, and so raising the ground on each side of the road. The deposit from the wash of rain on each side of all level roads is soon covered with growth ; it then catches the dust or aerial deposit, and unless the pickaxe and shovel are constantly at work the drainage of the road is soon choked up. In comparison to the broad waste from the wash of rain the waste by the direct action of rivers may be reckoned as nothing ; and even i"], [130, "[Ch. IX. 114 LYELL ON NEW RAVINES, Lyell on the Ganges. this waste by the direct action of rivers takes place, I might say, entirely when they are flooded by rain. The real main geological work of rivers is indirect; that is, the carrying off the traffic brought to them by the wash of rains ; and they carry this mighty traffic for the entire terrestrial surface of the globe ; at least their channels do. And the channels of most rivers would exist whether the rivers existed or not, as in the south you constantly see river beds dry or almost dry' except when filled by the superficial run of rain or the thawing of mountain snow ; and the size of the channels of all torrents and rivers (except in alluvial parts, for a reason which is given in chapter xiv.) is in proportion to the heavy floods of rain which occasionally rush through them, not to the comparatively small volume of spring water which always flows down them. Lyell, quoting Mr. Everest, calculates that in the rainy season (four months) the flooded Ganges discharges into the sea a weight of earth equal to fifty-six great pyramids, and in the other eight months only the weight of four pyramids. Now if Professor Sedgwick will only grant us these four pyramids for the snows of the Himalaya, we shall have an annual superficial ivash of soil amounting in weight to sixty pyramids. This is the ordinary and annual work resulting from"], [131, "115 Ch. IX.] AND ON THE GANGES. the operation of ordinary and annual rains on one river basin. But how many extraordinary floods, the result of extraordinary rains, have passed over the Ganges! Does Professor Sedgwick think that all this soil comes every year from the erosion of the banks of the Ganges, or even from the valley of the Ganges ? If it did, the valley of the Ganges would soon be barer of soil than its declivities. The soil comes from a great part of all the tops, and from all the sides of all the declivities of all the myriads of valleys ramifying from all the tributary valleys of the valley of the Ganges ; and what has passed into the sea in the formation of the valley is a mere nothing to what has passed down the valley and does now pass down it, from the denudation of those infinitely extended surfaces by rain. In the rainy season, there is, perhaps, a body of surface-water which flows down the vale to the sea in volume fifteen times as great as the spring water ; and were every spring of the Ganges permanently dried up, the vale would still be flooded every year by a stream in volume only less by a fifteenth part than that which flows every rainy season now, and fourteen times greater than that which flows in the three hot months. The following will show what has formerly i 2"], [132, "116 LYELL ON NEW RAVINES, [Ch. IX. come down, and what still does come down the sides of the Himalaya into the valley of the Ganges. \" A very ancient subterranean town, apparently of Hindoo origin, was discovered in India in 1833, in digging the Doab canal. Its site is north of Saharunpore, near the town of Behat, and seventeen feet below the present surface ofthe country. More than 170 coins of silver and copper have already been found, and many articles in metal and earthenware. The overlying deposit consisted of about five feet of river sand, with a substratum, about twelve feet thick, of red alluvial clay. In the neighbour hood are several rivers and torrents, which descend from the mountains charged with vast quantities of mud, sand, and shingle, and within the memory of persons now living the modern Behat has been threatened by an inundation, which, after retreating, left the neighbouring country strewed over with a superficial covering of sand several feet thick. In sinking wells in the environs masses of shingle and boulders have been reached, resembling those noiv in the river channels of the same district, under a deposit of thirty feet of reddish loam. Captain Cautley, therefore, who directed the excavations, supposes that the matter discharged by torrents has gradually raised the whole country, skirting"], [133, "Ch. IX.] 117 AND ON THE GANGES. Rain has laid the whole sur face of the earth in ridge and furrow. the base of the lower hills, and that the ancient town having been originally built in a hollow, was submerged by floods, and covered over with sediment, seventeen feet in thickness \" (\"Prin ciples\"). Denudation by rain extends over the whole space of the earth. Its pace will be modified, hastened, or retarded, or partially stopped, by a thousand such circumstances as compa rative hardness of surface, porousness, level ness, vegetation, heaviness of rain, hedges, and fences, &c. &c. Over vast tracts, denuda tion by rain is so slow as to be inappreciable. Still there is perhaps, scarcely any place in nature where excessive continued rain will not run ; and this run will be discoloured. This discolouration will be from soil ; and this soil will be deposited where the rain ceases to run. Even where the overflow of a river stands and deposits, that deposit may be subject to denuda tion from local rain after the river, or rather the flood, has subsided ; though the deposit of the river may be annually in excess, and accu mulation of soil may result, as in all alluvial valleys. But the chief thing which diminishes and retards the effect of the wash of rain is the very force of the cause. This force, speaking libe- i 3"], [134, "118 LYELL ON NEW RAVINES, [Ch. IX. rally, has thrown the whole surface of the earth into ridge and furrow, into these graduated vales sloping to the sea ; so that all the broad superficial runs of this wash are shortened, and are made lateral into these longitudinal channels. We shape our roads high in the middle on this principle, to throw the rain off on each side with the shortest possible run into the ditch or gutter, and to prevent a wash along the road, which would otherwise soon wash our artificial road away. Were it otherwise in nature, were there one plane descent from the tops of all the hills and mountains, the volume of the super ficial wash of rain, increasing as it descended, would many times in the year desolate the whole of the lower parts of the hills and moun tains; and the lower parts of the hill sides would have less soil than the upper parts ; they would be as bare of soil as the channels of torrents. The channels of torrents and rivers prevent this effect now; they are nature's ditches and gutters, so that, in this light, rivers may be regarded as a conservative, not a de structive, power. But rivers are mere labourers or accessories in the affair. The wash of rain is the engineer which has laid out the gradients of this preventive surface drainage over the entire area of the earth."], [135, "Ch. IX.] 119 AND ON THE GANGES. The source of the valley is always higher up than the source of the river. The source of the valley is always much higher up than the source of the river; I mean than the spring source of the river, for the snow source or glacier source being both superficial sources, I consider the same as the rain source of the valley. The river has no power of making a valley above it ; but a torrent of rain water has the power of scooping a valley below it. Even on Salisbury Plain, which is comparatively flat, and covered with the closest greensward, these dry valleys, or rather continuations of valleys, above the heads of rivers, exist: and that the cause which caused them still works may be argued from the valleys being richer in soil than the tops or sides of the hills, owing to the gentle gradients of the bottoms of the valleys ; for other things the same, that is, in the same strata, with the same vegetation, &c, one universal result of the wash of rain is, that the degree of denudation of soil will be directly as steepness. Some of these dry valleys have an almost imperceptible slope, and they might be perfectly level, and yet regular channels for the wash of periodical heavy rain. For if water can get out at one end of a level channel, and can not get out at the other end or at the sides, it not only i 4"], [136, "[Ch. IX. 120 LYELL ON NEW RAVINES, will, but must get out where it can, \" unda impellitur unda Ungueturque prior venienti, urguetque priorem,\" and it will carry with it much of the finer soil formed by disintegration and vegetation. When these chalky downs are ploughed up, the brow of the hill shows light, and the soil darkens in descending. This is from the rain washing the soil quickly down the hill, which is not so quickly supplied to the brow from the flatter top of the hill. Here the universal wash of rain may be seen. When one field comprehends the head of an entire coomb in a chalk country, the semicircular brow of the coomb in like manner shows light, and the soil darkens to the bottom of the coomb. When such a field is cropped, the crop also is light on the brow, and heavy in the bottom of the coomb. Here the universal wash of rain may not only be seen by the farmer but felt by him. This universal portage of soil by rain, the eternal effect of eternal causes, which in huge spaces of time results in such vast geological changes, may also be seen oculis fidelibus when ever a fence runs horizontally along the side of a hill. A natural terrace is then formed. For"], [137, "121 Ch. IX.] AND ON THE GANGES. aqueous denudation goes on below the fence, and in chalk countries the ground becomes white ; and not only does aqueous denudation cease above the fence, but aqueous deposit takes place, and the good soil which was on its way to the valley is arrested. Even a slight dead wattle, if kept up, will produce this effect, and though the hedge is dead the ground on which it is placed will grow. In France I have seen deep terraces result from very narrow strips left uncultivated to divide fields or properties. A gateway wrongly placed will often let considerable quantities of this collection of the best soil escape, which might otherwise have accumulated for what man might call for ever. So an injudicious down hill waggon- way, across fields, will sometimes act as a channel, and catching soil laterally convey it away from its proper owner. If your neighbour's land lies below you on a steep hill side, unless you wish to make him a present of your best soil, pound it back on to your own land by a fence, and when it accumulates against your fence cart it up the hill again. The beautiful artificial terracing of the hill side, which we see in southern mountain culti vation, originates in the necessity of catching the stream of soil from above, and preventing"], [138, "[Ch. IX. 122 LYELL ON NEW RAVINES, its farther descent to the valley below, down which it would be washed, whether it were a dry valley or a river valley. In unusually heavy rains, numbers of these terrace walls give way ; and when a terrace goes which is high up the hill side, a sort of earthen avalanche takes place, bearing crops, soil, and stone walls in succession to the vale below. In these works man shows himself as a strong conservative. In alluding to man as a leveller, our great geologist admirably remarks : \" By ploughing up thousands of square miles, and exposing a surface for part of the year to the action of the elements, we assist the abrading force of rain, and diminish the conservative effects of vegetation ; \" and by fencing these thousands of square miles, man acts as a very universal conservative. The existence of upper valleys or dry rivers of soil, proves that, were there no such things as rivers on the globe, the scooping power of agglomerated rain would still give the same alternation of hills with valleys sloping to the sea which now obtains, and the same waste and denudation from lateral wash would still take place.

I believe that in many cases where the country is composed of soft and porous materials, as chalk, the depth of the valleys and channels scooped out by rain lays open the springs, and forms the rivers, instead of the rivers forming the valleys. How many dry valleys are there sloping to the sea, without having laid open a spring, and therefore without any stream ? And what formed these valleys ? How many lateral or branch dry valleys are there falling into the main longitudinal dry valley, whose lower end joins the upper end of the river valley ? And how many lateral or branch dry valleys fall into the main river valley ? And what formed these countless myriads of dry valleys ? Nothing can be more pellucid than our Hampshire streams, except in heavy rain. And to look at them we should not say that they carried much soil to the sea. But throw a dam across the valley and form a pond. Deep mud is instantly deposited over the whole bottom of the pond, and a boggy delta where the stream enters.

That attribute is, that like the atmosphere, it will get to the top. So that, not withstanding our friend fire, water even now covers three quarters of the surface of our globe. But water not only has a tendency to find one level for itself, but to reduce the solids of the"], [142, "126 ABSURDITY OF THE [Ch. X- globe to one level. And as this principle is for ever at work, a uniform level of all solids would take place below water but for fire. The great Laplace has guessed, as some think very erroneously, that the average depth ofthe sea might be about the average height of the land, or 3280 feet. From Sir James Ross's soundings (\" Principles,\" page 105.), it would appear that the greatest depths of the sea may not differ much from the greatest height of mountains. Our highest mountain would be represented by a grain of sand, on a globe of six feet in diameter. Therefore, the deepest part of the sea would be represented \\>y the cast or impres sion of a grain of sand on such a. globe. What a puddle then is the sea, in point of cubical con tents, compared with the solid globe. But with draw the inequalities of the solids and the puddle flows over them, and \"Full fathom five thy father lies,\" together with all organic terrestrial existence. This appears paradoxical, because in our every day experience we see liquids running down solids, and seeking a level below them.

It is then condensed, and descends as rain, or snow, or dew. What is not evaporated, runs down to the sea, either continuously on the surface, or, if it sinks below the surface, by springs and rivers, and the largest rivers are merely re turning vapour. This water carries with it solids to the sea, which sink to the bottom of the sea; and the same act which sinks the solids of the globe raises the liquids of the globe. Every one must see that this all-pervading, ever-acting circle of causes must result in depositing exist ing continents under the sea. And this is going on now, and has been going on, as man might say, from all eternity ; and as old continents have disappeared new continents have been raised, and old ones hoisted farther up by sub terranean igneous action.

Herschel, however, with Lyell, makes the sea, acting on its shores, \" grind down \" the solids, instead ofthe universal circle of causes. If this is so, we shall have some high cliffs at Chimboraco, and along the Andes. A cliff 24,000 feet in height would be worth seeing. What a squat, tame cone the Peak of Tenerife would be to this! But what average height would Orographers allow for the cliff from Panama to Patagonia? 15,000 feet? Incon venient for landing even if it was only 1500.

I will take Mr. M'Clausland (\" Sermons in Stones \"), as the latest expositor of the \" igneous fusion \" theory, which was originated by Leib nitz nearly two centuries ago (1680).

Between the granite and the Devonian beds are deposited, over the whole globe, 1st. the Azoic or Cambrian beds, 26,000 feet thick, and above these, the Silurian, 30,000 feet thick, making together a coating to the entire terrestrial globe of upwards often miles in thickness. This enormous growth over the entire globe is, \" grain by grain, and layer by layer, raised by deposit from the granite bed of the ancient ocean,\" That is, it is raised from the bed on which it is deposited, so that the last or uppermost mile of deposit must have passed through the first or lowermost nine miles of deposit. It is true that in other parts of the work mud issues from the melted mass, and \" muddy vapour \" from the sea. But how mud got into the mass melted by heat, or how it issued from the melted mass as mud does not appear. But suppose sufficient incandescent mud to be ejected to increase the diameter of the globe at any and every point twenty miles, would there be no collapse ? or no inletting of the sea ? and conse quent laying bare of dry land ? Laplace put the average depth of the sea at 3000 feet. I wish he was at my elbow to tell E"], [146, "[Ch.

And when it began to leak, and to let 3000 feet of water into the chambers which formerly held 56,000 feet of incandescent mud, or half, or a quarter, or a tenth part of it, whether the entire surface of the globe would not be dry land ? with that surface as smoothly horizontal as the ocean at its calmest. This would indeed well ac count for the appearance of some dry land in the Devonian period, when, according to Mr. M'Clausland, dry land first appeared ; though, according to common sense, till dry land did appear there could be no denudation, and con sequently no deposit on \" the granite bed of the ancient ocean.\" If the incandescent theory is true, I think it follows that in process of time, as internal heat cools, all organic existence, vegetable and animal, must die a natural death of cold. Also that as internal heat ceases to replace continents as they are washed beneath the wave, we must end in a chaotic ocean, as the incandescent theory supposes that we began. In such a case, however, Mr. M'Clausland, though deprived of his incandescent mud, could still \" coldly furnish forth,\" over the entire submarine earth, a coating"], [147, "Ch.

But is not all this to take the affair out of the hands of the Creator ? to bring his magnificent machinery to a stand-still of itself, like a mun dane clock, unless it be constantly wound up ? Or rather is it not pure Brahminism ? For \"Brahma on awaking from sleep always finds the world a shapeless ocean.\" And when Brahma goes to sleep again \" the universe is reduced to one vast ocean.\" Very great philosophers have asserted that evaporation from surfaces of moist earth is as great as from equal surfaces of water. If this is true, it does not follow that we are equally indebted to equal surfaces of land as to equal surfaces of water for our rain, since surfaces of earth have a trick of becoming dry after a certain degree of evaporation. That we are mainly indebted for our rain to evaporation from the sea I stated thus in a letter to the Hampshire paper in September 1845. The moisture which rises through the air must be equal to that which falls through it. But vast quantities (say half) which fall on earth run into the sea by rivers. If then no more moisture rises from water than from an equal surface of earth, K 2"], [148, "[Ch.

As the moisture which is absorbed by vege tation is returned to the atmosphere, I consider it in the same account as that which is absorbed and returned by the earth. For vegetables while they live exhale, and when they die they dry. If a tree lives a thousand years, and its heart wood is always moist, even if it were proved that that moisture were unchanged, the thousand years come to an end, and on the average, a year's absorption of moisture by vegetation is annually returned to the air. No standing water, however, can retain the same level for two successive days, but must be always rising from rain or falling from evapora tion. When we consider the difference of level from these opposite causes every instant pro gressing in open oceans, the marvel is that the currents are as gentle and as regular as they are supposed to be.

Lyell supposes \" that the hydrogen evolved during the process of saturation may, on coming after wards in contact with the heated metallic oxides, reduce them again to metals ; and this circle of action may be one of the principal means by which internal heat and the stability of volcanic energy are preserved.\" If these doctrines are correct, the circle of causes, now in operation, is perfect ; and there is no reason why the existence of this world should ever go out of itself, or perish except by the will of the omnipotent God who created it. The earth eternal, udess destroyed by the will of God This is not so with the species of plants and animals which exist on the globe.

The existence of species tran sitory, and de pendent on second causes. Every local change in physical geography works not only a local but a general change in climate and physical conditions over the whole globe. The admirable Lyell accounts most magnificently for the vast changes of the general temperature which have evidently taken place over the whole globe, and shows that these changes are, and ever will be, taking place. That is, directly as land increases in polar Perpetual change of cli mate and phy sical conditions over the whole globe. K 4"], [152, "136 THE EARTH AND MAN ETERNAL, [Ch.

The vast variety of extant and extinct land animals con- tained in the English drift beds will be alluded to in chapter xiii.

But are succes sively created. and animals are the result of different physical conditions ; that the different species are mere changes of form and organisation resulting from different physical conditions, and that man him self'is merely the final result of these manifold changes from the zoophyte upward. The Great Artificer authoritatively and abso lutely contradicts all this, by having, possibly from all time, and apparently successively and at distinct times, and in comparatively modern times, created distinct existences or species, and kept these distinct species separate under pre cisely similar physical conditions. This is the case with animals, vegetables, birds, reptiles, insects, fish, shell animals, and zoophytes, whether any of all these named are terrestrial, or aquatic, or amphibious, or peculiar to fresh, brackish, or salt-water. And not only is this so now, but apparently through an indefinite number of ages the terraqueous globe has been thus gradually and in succession stocked and restocked with species entirely distinct from those existing in this or in any two of the different periods. Indeed, supposing species to have originated from single stocks, the creation of existing species could not have been simul taneous. Had it been simultaneous, all animals, herbivorous or carnivorous, must have fasted or"], [154, "138 THE EARTH AND MAN ETERNAL, [Ch. XL have destroyed whole species at a mouthful. Creation must have been successive as far as this.

Humboldt says we might have lived on fish, which were doubtless created in shoals. For \" the existence of races of men inhabiting the icy regions of the north polar lands, and whose nutriment is solely derived from fish and the cetaceans shows the possi bility of maintaining life independently of vege table substances.\" And animals ? and birds ? Horace's doves and kids ? were they too icthy ophagous? Did Horace describe the actual ancient state of things when he hung his elm boughs with fish, and floated his kids on the briny wave ? \" Piscium et summo genus h\u00e6sit ulmo, Nota qu\u00e6 sedes fuerat columbis, Et superjecto pavid\u00e6 natarunt, \u00c6quore dam\u00e6.\" Kid-fishers !

The whole of the land and of"], [155, "Ch. XI.] UNLESS DESTROYED BY GOD. 139 the water, and even of the air of these and of all intermediate regions are crammed full of organic existences. We all see this in temperate regions; and I will instance only some of the largest quadrupeds, herbivorous and carnivorous, on the extremes of cold and heat, because these could not exist in regions which were not replete with vegetable and animal life for their food. In the arctic regions we find the musk-ox, the reindeer, the huge polar bear, the wolf, the seal, the whale, &c. ; in the tropics, the elephant, the rhinoceros, the camel, the giraffe, the lion, the hippopotamus, the shark, &c. But nature is by no means content with this wonderful adaptation of her organic creation to differing physical con- ditions. Like the chicken-fancier, who keeps his fowl-yards separate, nature seems purposely to have contrived different stations with similar physical conditions, in order to exhibit the pro- fuseness of her creative power, in cramming all full of animal and vegetable existences, with con- stitutions similar to those of similar but separate stations, but the species of each similar separate station differing entirely from the species of all other similar separate stations. These stations are in general kept separate by what Buffon called \" natural barriers.\" Besides the difference of climate, resulting from difference of latitude,"], [156, "[Ch. XI. 140 THE EARTH AND MAN ETERNAL, Distinct stations have distinct creations. difference of altitude, and seas of water, or of sand, or of eternal snow, in general separate terrestrial districts ; continents, currents, differ ence of depth, saltness, freshness, or temperature of the water, separate aquatic districts. M. Alph. de Candolle, son of the great De Candolle, enumerates twenty-seven great nations of distinct indigenous aboriginal plants. That the plants and animals of such vast districts of stations as America and Australia should be different from those of every other part of the globe, from which they are so completely divided, does not strike one with so much astonishment as that there should be \" found one assemblage of species in China, another in the countries bordering the Black Sea, and a third in those surrounding the Mediterranean.\" Here distance, and prior oc cupancy seem to take the duties of natural barriers. But, however small, and however com paratively modern, the spot, if it be inclosed by natural barriers (as, for instance, St. Helena), it will apparently have a creation for itself. So in the Galapagos islands, of which there are ten principal islands, under the line, 600 miles westward of America, of modern origin, judging from the fresh appearance of about 2000 craters, Lyell says of them : \" Although each small island is not more than fifty or sixty miles apart, and"], [157, "Ch. XI.] UNLESS DESTROYED BY GOD. 141 most of them are in sight of each other, formed of precisely the same rock, rising nearly to an equal height, and placed under a similar climate ; they are tenanted each by a different set of beings. Of twenty-six different species of land birds found in the Galapagos archipelago, all, with the exception of one, are distinct from those inhabiting other parts of the globe ; and in other archipelagoes, a single island sometimes contains a species found in no other spot on the whole earth.\" Wings themselves furnish no exception to the rule. The Creator hangs his cages, containing distinct birds, in distinct separate regions, though those distinct separate regions may have precisely the same physical conditions. Lyell quotes Darwin : \" The archipelago is a little world within itself. One is astonished at the amount of creative force displayed on so many small, barren, and rocky islands, and still more so at its diverse, yet analogous, action on points so near each other. I have said that the Galapagos archipelago might be called a satellite attached to America ; but it should rather be called a group of satellites, physically similar, organically distinct, yet inti mately related to each other, and all related in a marked, though much lesser, degree to the great American continent.\" But the plan of the Great Creator seems in all"], [158, "142 THE EARTH AND MAN ETERNAL, [Ch.

He has throughout all time made continents to come, and to go \u2014 to have a birth, life, death, and burial. He wields the mighty power of subterranean igneous action, in raising them into hyp\u00e6thral existence ; and, as if to show their nothingness in his hands, he redeposits them in the subaqueous regions by the quiet action of the raindrop from heaven, or, at his will, he places his almighty finger on the mountain-top, and submerges it bodily below the wave. And he has always, as species died out, and doubtless continues, even at this moment, to originate single stocks of new plants and animals, which radiate from where their Creator first locates them, as far round as his natural barriers will allow them.

As will have been seen in chapter x., it is not meant to deny the all-dominant influence of fire on the form of the land of the globe. Fire first raises the continent, and, therefore, first forms it. Rain afterwards transforms its surface. Subterranean igneous heat is the quarryman who raises the block. Rain is the artist who shapes its surface. \" Beauty is but skin deep.\" We are not the less for that touched by beauty, nor by the exquisite beauty of the surface of the earth. We owe this beauty of the surface to water, not to fire. Could the labourer of Paros with justice write \"Non me Praxiteles fecit\""], [161, "Ch.

This forming or trans forming of the surface is, however, all that is claimed for rain. On the subject of the original forming of the land by fire, Humboldt uses plenty of sesquipe dalian words, and quotes authors from Eratos thenes downward. I shall be satisfied with one quotation from one author : \" Parturiunt montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.\" With regard to the cause of the form of the land : \" Very little can be empirically determined regarding the causal connexion of the phenomena of the formation of continents, or of the analogies and contrasts presented by their configuration. All that we know regarding this subject resolves itself into this one point, that the active cause is subterranean, that continents did not arise at once in the form they now present, but were, as we have already observed, increased by degrees, by means of numerous oscillatory elevations and depressions of the soil, or, were formed by the fusion of separate smaller continental masses.\" With regard to the effect of this cause, in con junction with Bacon, Polybius, and Eratosthenes, Humboldt calls our attention to \" the pyramidal L"], [162, "146 [Ch. XII. FIRE FORMS CONTINENTS, configuration of all the southern extremities of continents.\" Here we become mithraic, and Humboldt shows us more PYRamids even than Eratosthenes. The letter A has also a \" pyramidal configura tion,\" and four out of five of our continents, which end in pyramids, begin and end with this pyramidal letter, ASIA, AFRICA, AMERICA, and AUSTRALIA. Axis, Arctic, and Antarctic, also begin with it. These coincidences cannot be accidental. I do not pretend to class myself with the gentlemen named above. But I do think that this one original idea of mine is likely to be as useful, and is in all respects as worthy consideration in a co(s)mical way, as their joint stock company one. It is true that \" lands-ends \" are apt to be pyramidal, to whatever point of the compass they may face. And if we saw as much of the northern lands-ends of our continents as we do of their southern lands-ends, they might show a fair share of pyramids. Indeed, since the time of Eratosthenes, the north of Europe at the north cape, and of Asia at the north-east cape, have been found to be pyramidal.

But \" as the fool thinks the bell clinks,\" and if a man happens to be a fire-worshipper, and wishes to see a pyramid, he will see one in the section of a circle, and out of a square he will make four beauties. If a man does not wish to see pyramids, I do not think that he will see them in the south of Australia and New Zealand, which Humboldt quotes as continents, more than he will on the north of them, or of Borneo, or any island north or south from Iceland to Ma dagascar. But since all the protuberances of the earth's crust have been thrust up by subterranean fire, and as the intervals between these protuberances may be called hollows, it may perhaps be asserted that these hollows are valleys, formed by fire, not by water. All seas and lakes are such hollows. From the top of Mont Blanc in the Alps to the Rocky Mountains in North America, or to the top of Chimboraco in the Andes, may in this sense be said to be a hollow. From the Andes to the Himalaya another, and between Europe and Africa a third. If these hollows are called the valleys of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Mediterranean, L 2"], [164, "[Ch.

Some day, I suppose, a mountain, or chain of mountains, a cordillera, or tierra or sierra Humboldtiana, will be discovered, equivalent in size to the surface and depth of \" our \" Atlantic. I think Humboldt is too modest here ; he should call it my Atlantic. The surface of \" our \" Atlantic is about twenty five millions of square miles, and unless it was a sea before it was formed into a sea, it must have been surmounted by a continent when it fell a victim to the \" eddjdng waters.\" Besides, there fore, the depth of the sea, the height of the old continent must be added to the new one. Theoretically, the formation of this particular continent, the Tierra Humboldtiana, would differ from that of continents in general. For they, according to Humboldt, \" were formed by the fusion of separate, smaller, continental masses.\" L 3"], [166, "150 [Ch. XII. FIRE FORMS CONTINENTS, What a valley is. Practically, the difference of formation would be found great indeed. For this huge heap would be formed by the confusion of vast masses of dis rupted rock, which would clearly distinguish it from all boulder drifts and alluviums, and from all continents of stratified beds. Aqua fortis must have been the water of those days, or it could never, at a swoop, have torn up these solid rocks to the depth of 30,000 feet. It is lamentable to find an Englishman imposed on by such bombastic trash. Keith Johnston, in his Physical Atlas, says \" the Atlantic ocean occupies the great longitudinal valley, extending,\" &c. If this is not an abuse of terms, we may say that three quarters of the surface space of the globe are occupied by one valley, and that the Pacific, Atlantic, Arctic, Antarctic, Indian, China, Mediterranean, Black, White, Yellow, Red, Baltic, Caribbean seas, with all their in numerable gulfs, bays, straits, and rivers, are only parts, particular nooks, corners, and lanes in this one valley.

If you overstep a ridge Avhich separates two water sheds, I think you overstep the border of two valleys. Thus, if you stand on the chalk of the North Downs, south-east of London, where the Medway passes through them, and look to the chalk of the Anglian heights, east of Cambridge, when north of the Essex heights, you overstep the valley of the Thames, though you are still within what is absurdly called the basin of London. The valley of London would be the valley of the Thames ; but the basin of London is quite another affair, and is no valley at all. The north-east half of the basin of London is out of the valley of the Thames, and the north-west half of the valley of the Thames is out of the basin of London. The basins of London, Paris, and Hampshire, have no relation whatever to valleys, river-courses, or basins. They only refer to those parts of these neighbourhoods which are still undenuded, and covered with tertiary strata, and these strata pass over hill and dale, and are not, as is usually stated, patches deposited in hollows. The origin of this opinion is twofold. First, some author has dubbed these tertiary regions basins, and his readers have naturally supposed that the basins are hollow, which they are not. Second, tertiary strata being frequently L 4"], [168, "[Ch.

The hollows formed in the original igneous elevation of land above the sea are infinite and innumerable. But they are not valleys. Water instantly occupies them, and turns them into seas or lakes, or fills them with drift and allu vium, or transforms them into valleys. That is, the moment any part of the bed of the sea is raised, rain shapes it into ridge and furrow. If England and Ireland were raised so as to lay dry the part of the sea between them, this hollow could not be claimed as formed by running water. But though running water had not formed the one hollow, it would immediately transform it into two valleys. From some middle part the waters would flow in opposite directions to the sea. They would instantly fill all minor hollows with water, and gradually with drift and alluvium, at the same time wearing down the sides of the hollows next the sea, and would continue for ever to deepen these two valleys from the sea upwards. The cross ridge, from which the waters flowed north and south, being least exposed to the wash of rain, that is, having no accumulation of wash from above it, would increase in height in comparison with the depth of the valleys, and would as much"], [169, "Ch.

For as long as the sea acts on the foot of a cliff it remains a pre cipice ; because the undermining water acts more rapidly than disintegration and wash, and clears away all that falls. Abstract this power, even by the accidental accumulation of a bank of travelling shingle, and the cliff has a tendency to conform to the slope of the hill above it, that is, to the ivash of the hill above it, both at the brow of the cliff and at its foot. For what is washed down the hill and off its brow will lie at the foot of the cliff as a shelving bank, and what was the mid-cliff gradually becomes the sole cliff. But this will eventually disappear into one slope. * Keith Johnston talks of \" the plain of the Mississippi- Mackenzie.\" He might as well talk of the plain of the Rhine-Danube, the centre of which plain would be the plain of the Alps."], [170, "154 FIRE FORMS CONTINENTS, [Ch. XII. If the top of the cliff is table land, or slopes from the cliff, the cliff will waste much more slowly by disintegration and the action of the elements. But supposing such a cliff to be all of the same material, I think the brow has a ten dency to disappear most quickly, possibly from a freer access and action of rain-water in disinte gration, and possibly also from roots inserting themselves in crevices, and by turgescence de taching blocks bodily. Besides this roots in decay generate carbonic acid, which is a great disintegrator. Another reason may be that the wash from above, which erodes and degrades the brow, is shot clear of lower parts, as in the case of a waterfall. In addition to this, the entire surface of these former cliffs and present hill-sides would be laid in ridge and furrow. They would be grooved throughout by rain with small incipient valleys. And if it may be said that the apexes and ridges of mountains are not formed by rain, I answer that they are at least transformed by rain. That is, their surface is formed by rain. The mountain top and brow are the very places to see this universal artificer begin his work.

So in fresh-water strata amphibious animals and fresh-water productions prevail ; and in beds of drift and alluvium, or \" sediment deposited on dry land,\" land animals and plants.

If land animals had only a mil lionth chance of permanent imbedding which shell-fish have, what Theria Cruickshanksiana and Sidebottomi we should behold ! \" As weak as water \" is the common saying ; yet water, in the form of rain, detroys old con tinents, and in the form of mud water builds new continents. That land should flow out to sea is as para doxical and appears as impossible as that water should go up through the air. Yet both these impossibilities not only go on every day but all day long ; and we see the water in the air as clouds, and the land in the water as muddy water. But it is only as muddy water that land goes out to sea, or as the finest sand. It is only as muddy water that the new emigrant continent takes passage to its destination. All the coarser material brought by floods to the shore remains there till the waves have ground it fine enough for carriage. \" And the waves they are never weary.\" It is a large mill, and night or day never ceases to grind. It is clear, however, that not a single bone of a land animal could be carried out to sea, except when a body, having sunk near the sea, rises again from putrescence and floats for a short time. But even in this case, except with an"], [176, "160 MAN MAY HAVE EXISTED [Ch. XIII. Possibility that coal may be al ways forming. off-shore wind, the body would probably be cast ashore. Or an animal may be floated out on a tree, or on an iceberg, and if not devoured may become fossil. I need not go farther to show the impossibility that nature should write us a perfect catalogue of foregone land animals, from such scanty materials, even if the archives which she has written were accessible to us. With regard to land plants it is otherwise. They might all float out to sea for great distances ; that is, till they are water-logged, till water has replaced the air which they contain. To this provision we owe our coal-beds ; and I think it somewhat puzzling that coal should be confined to the Paleozoic strata. On the west coast of Africa, immediately to the north of the equator, the Niger discharges from the mouths of its delta vast quantities of drift wood. Immediately to the south of the equator the Congou does the same. And I have been told by merchants, and by officers serving on that coast, that islands of wood with trees growing on them float out to sea from both these rivers. The admirable Rennel has chalked out for us the course of the current which must convey this drift vegetation across the Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico. We have all heard of the vast rafts formed in the Mississippi from the accu-"], [177, "Ch. XHI.] IN THE SILURIAN PERIOD. 161 Drift and alluvium, or \" deposit on dry land.\" mulation of drift timber. We have all heard of the enormous quantities of drift wood discharged from the mouths of the Amazon, the Orinoco, and the tropical rivers of the north part of South America. What becomes of these vast magazines of carbon till they are so water-logged as to sink ? Probably, as Lyell remarks, a large proportion takes passage by the Gulf Stream. And not improbably, vast beds of future coal may now be depositing in high northern lati tudes, the greatest part of which may be com posed of tropical plants. The tropics of the old world, as well as the new, are most probably at this moment storing their superabundant vege tation for the future warming of our northern descendants. If this is true, coal may be found in any stratum foregone or to come. Lyell heads a paragraph with \" no sediment on dry land,\" \" Principles,\" chap. xiii. What then is the entire deposit of all alluvial plains ? and of that part of all deltas which is above the level of the sea ?

Lyell would account for these beds as the remains of his favourite submarine denudation, previous to the elevation of the land. If so, why are they so full of the fossil remains of land animals ? and how does the submarine theory apply to the drift bed near Behat, in India, mentioned in the ninth chapter, which, Captain Cautley tells us, was deposited \" within the memory of persons now living \" ? And how does it apply to the bed which covers the \" very ancient subterranean town \" there ? Was the present subterranean town formerly a submarine one ? \" In sinking wells in the environs, masses of shingle and boulders have been reached resembling those now in the river channels of the same district (so we see how long the game which is now playing has been going on) under a deposit of thirty feet of reddish loam. Captain Cautley, therefore, who directed the excavations, supposes that the matter discharged by torrents has gradually raised the whole country skirting the base of the lower hills.\" As these are quotations from Lyell's own \" Principles,\" may I not again ask, in his own words, if \" a false theory does not render him blind to facts which are opposed to his prepos-"], [179, "Ch.

But the beds of drift, in general, are of enormous extent, and are not confined only to the alluvial neighbourhood of rivers and their estuaries, or even to low lands, but are found on very high lands provided they have higher land, or have had higher lands in their neighbourhood. High steep places waste com paratively rapidly on to lower and less steep places. Low flat places waste comparatively slowly into the sea. But, except on the brow of a hill, when a geologist states the arrangement of the beds of any district, the following is almost invariably his exordium : \u2014 1. Vegetable mould. 2. Alluvial gravel, loam, clay, &c. (that is, \" sediment deposited on dry land.\") 3. The upper layer, which has been deposited not only by water but in water.

And though these beds are considered geo logically new, and indeed some of them were formed yesterday and some are forming to-day, they are not all so new but what the English beds of them contain remains of species long since extinct on earth, as the mastodon or the mammoth, and of animals which have long since ceased to inhabit these climes, as the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, buffalo, elk, reindeer,"], [181, "165 Ch.

Floods bury a great part of the slain, and the same floods which form the drift beds stock them with land animals, and except as exceptions, these \" deposits on dry land \" are the only spots where we should find fossil land animals ; and to argue that no land quadrupeds (or if you will have a fine word, mammalia) existed during the period that any or every marine stratum was deposited, on the negative evidence that no fossils of them are found there, is ridiculous. And because we happen on beds stored with fossils of amphibious creatures and gigantic lizards, to assume that the whole earth, from the denudation of a part of which these beds were formed, supported no other animals, and therefore to talk of \" the age \"\u2022bf reptiles,\" is equally ridiculous.

If this does not prove that the entire masses of these strata were de posited from the subaerial denudation of land which was high above the sea, it at least proves that while these beds were being deposited they were within the reach of high land which was suffering denudation. I have inserted ripplemarks in my list of wit nesses, because they form almost my only claim to the Silurian and primary and metamorphic beds. Ripplemarks, however, evidently testify the neighbourhood of land while the ground on which they were imprinted was subject to depo sition. Had the ground on which they were formed been rising and subject to denudation, they would have vanished. With regard to the remains of land plants, Lyell (\"Principles\") says ofthe Silurian beds: \" Hitherto few, if any, contemporaneous vegetable remains have been noticed ; but such as are mentioned agree more nearly with the plants of the carboniferous era than any other, and would therefore imply a warm and humid atmosphere, entirely free from intense cold throughout the year.\" According"], [185, "Ch.

And I think that this accounts for \" the hiatus which still separates the cretaceous and Eocene periods in Europe.\" For it is only natural that the organic remains of the deep-sea deposit should differ from those of deposits formed from the detritus of land. In chalk countries denudation leaves a re siduum of flints on the surface ; because, though these flints disintegrate, and though each of them is surrounded with a white soft surface of decay, they do not decay so fast as the chalk. Not withstanding the most sedulous stonepicking, these flints still make their appearance, and it is the universal opinion among farmers that they grow, not in size, but in numbers.

But, doubtless, Ellet's opinions are practice, and his neighbour's opinions \" specula tions.\" This is a very usual and very useful definition of the difference between theory and practice. Ellet calls the whole of the alluvial plain the delta. I should restrict the delta to that small part of an alluvial plain from the sea to where the river first breaks into branches to the sea, the two outside of which, with the sea shore, often form a A. I do not, however, fight about a name, nor should I if it was the hardest and longest Humboldt ever coined. But Ellet makes \" the head of the delta \" and the line of the ancient sea shore the same, and he places these as far north or up the river as Commerce, above the Ohio. I should place the line of the ancient shore at least as far south as the present shore, about New Orleans. Ellet, indeed, depre cates the mooting the question, and designates it as \" an irrelevant geological speculation.\" But, as will be seen by the diagram, page 180, Ellet forms his delta solely forward and solely in the sea. And according to him and his dia gram, it is only the sea-formed delta which rises."], [189, "Ch. XIV.] 173 THE MISSISSIPPI. The beds of rivers and valleys are formed chiefly backward, or up the valley. From the sea shore upward or backward, the level of the land-formed alluvial plain has been stationary for 45,000 years ! It is therefore of vital importance, even to Ellet's extraordinary theory, to know which part of the plain is sea formed, and which is land-formed, that is, where the ancient sea shore ran. I shall refer to this question hereafter, and shall here endeavour to show that all alluvial plains, including their deltas, increase and rise every year everywhere, backward up the valleys, as well as forward in the sea, at the ends of the deltas. Rain, or a river, works at the whole length of the valley or river course at the same time. But the chief formation is backward, that is, from the sea to the hill. For, as the beds of rivers, if not horizontal, slope down to the sea, it is evident that the cutting down of the parts farthest from the sea must depend on the cutting down of the parts nearest the sea ; that is, the parts farthest from the sea cannot be cut lower than the parts next the sea. So far the cutting of the parts farthest from the sea is dependent on the cutting of the parts next the sea. So that the chief longitudinal cutting of a valley or river-bed may be said to proceed from below upward as regards the valley, or backward as regards the stream of the river ; that is, it pro-"], [190, "174 [Ch. XIV. ELLET ON ceeds from the sea to the hill, not from the hill to the sea. No one will doubt that the Niagara gorge is cut backward; but take the case of a barrier without a lake behind it. Suppose a barrier of rock to run across any valley or river-bed ; when the bed of the valley or river on the upper side of the barrier has been worn down to a horizontal level with this barrier, it can not go lower. The barrier is in this particular case what the sea is in all cases, a negative key to the level of the valley. Thus deep shalt thou go and no deeper. A river-bed cannot run down before it comes to the barrier and then up again over the barrier. But as the barrier is cut through, the bed of the valley or river will be deepened backward, or from below upward, or towards the hills. This principle is true of the filling in of valleys as well as of the scooping them out. For when the scooping out or deepening is stopped at the lower end by the sea or a barrier of rock, denu dation of the inclined parts above still goes on, and makes that lower part horizontal. And the passage of the detritus and soil from the inclined upper parts of valleys is checked in the horizontal lower parts of valleys, and soil accumulates there. This is the origin of alluvial plains ; and a river of any size, or any rapidity, may, at any distance"], [191, "Ch. XIV.] 175 THE MISSISSIPPI. Rivers may have patches of alluvia] plain anywhere, and these patches progress backward, or up the valley. from the sea, have patches of alluvial plain, where no lakes have ever been ; that is, above every rapid or accidental barrier of hard ground. For as the barrier ponds the flood-water back on the horizontal valley above it, deposit will take place, that deposit will increase the ponding back up the valley, and, as long as overflow takes place, these patches will rise and progress backward up the valley. The only difference in the laws for the growth and gradient of these patches from those which regulate the growth and gradient of the plain at the level of the sea, is that they have no increasing cause for rising equivalent to the forward lengthening of the delta of the lower alluvial plain. These flat alluvial patches may be seen even in torrents, sometimes reaching from one cascade to the other; and though each cascade digs a hole deep in proportion to the height of the cascade, as the cascade recedes, that part of the hole or rather groove which is farthest from the cascade is filled with debris. It is easy to perceive that these patches must be liable to constant change. They must be perpetually shortened by the recession of the lower barrier, and lengthened by the recession of the upper one : also that the wearing down of a barrier or shallow from below will expose the alluvial"], [192, "176 [Ch. XIV. ELLET ON patch above it to denudation ; while the rise of an alluvial patch from below, over a rapid above it, may join two alluvial patches in one. These principles are eternally at work on all valleys, from the smallest to the largest. With regard to the lower alluvial plain, the last yard protruded at the level of the sea, by preventing the flood-water spreading in the sea, that is, by ponding the water back, forces it over the yard behind it, and raises that yard above the level of the sea; and so every yard raises the yard behind it backward in succession not only to the highest point of the alluvial plain, but above it ; that is, from the end of the delta at the sea, the river builds its alluvial plain at a certain gradient (say that given by Ellet, eight inches in a mile), and its banks, say at a gradient of three inches in a mile, till these gradients strike the unalluvial bed, which it progresses up ; and whether the whole river is artificially embanked, or whether it has patches embanked, in either case, the banks must eternally be raised with the eternal rising of this natural gradient. Thus it is that a river is enabled to build itself a channel of indefinite length out to sea (the Ganges runs 220 miles out to sea), the sides of which channel shall not only confine for three parts of the year, the waters which built them,"], [193, "Ch. XIV.] 177 THE MISSISSIPPI. I but these banks shall rise high above the level of the sea through which they are built, and shall attain, on the alluvial plain, to the height of 300 feet in 500 miles, though the river which builds them is the very power which excavated their foundations. All this appears impossible : yet every day, in every quarter of the globe, these impossibilities are being performed. The height of banks thus built above the spring-water, is simply the difference between the level of the flood-water and spring-water. The difference between the level of the flood water and spring-water at the sea is nothing. Therefore the banks die off to nothing at the sea. And one would suppose that there must be a fixed rule for the height of alluvial banks, accord ing to the distance from the sea. In other words, that there must be a fixed rule for the increased rise of the flood-water necessary to overflow alluvial banks, directly as their increased distance from the sea. Though possibly this would chiefly depend on the quantity and sud denness of the floods to which each individual river is subject. I have seen somewhere, I think in Herodotus, the planetary number 7 applied to the Nile, in the supposition that at Mendes it required a rise of 7 cubits to overflow the banks, at Memphis 14, and at Syene 28. The rule N"], [194, "178 [Ch. XIV- ELLET ON The practical man's mon- strous theory of the formation of the delta. however, if there be one, would only apply where the banks and bed are completely alluvial. The deposits must also tend to die off to nothing at the upper end of the alluvial valley, unless the slope of the unalluvial valley is suddenly termi nated by a ridge of rock. This determination of valleys to begin at the end, and to go on backwards, is, as has been said, the cause why they are generally widest at the end next the sea. Because the longitudinal cut ting being there first made, the sides will be there first exposed to disintegration and the lateral wash of rain. So that, other circumstances the same, valleys widen as they descend. But directly as the comparative hardness of the sides of any part of a valley will be the comparative narrowness of that part. Ellet has left the main natural difficulty out of the calculation. That is, he has blinked the growth of the alluvial plain backward up the valley, on the land. To suit his mode of forming the delta only forward, and only in the sea, he introduces the sea (and a deep sea too) 500 miles into the continent of America, up \" to the village of Commerce, about thirty miles above the mouth of the Ohio.\" \" It is not an unrea sonable supposition that, at periods anterior to the commencement of the deposit, the bed of"], [195, "Ch. XIV.] THE MISSISSIPPI. 179 the gulf sloped up uniformly from its present depth ('more than 1000 feet') near Belize to the shores then found above the mouth of the Ohio.\" Here he tumbles the Mississippi over a cata ract at \" the point at which rock in situ is first encountered on both sides of its channel, and supposed to be found in its bed.\" The cataract has \" a fall of 285 feet at low water, or nearly double the actual perpendicular descent of the falls of Niagara.\" And the same rock still remains \" in situ \" in the channel of the river over which this cascade rolled for 45,000 years, while it formed the delta. And the wear and tear, not only of the floods of the river, for this space of time, but the passage of the material of the entire alluvial plain, have neither lowered the rock a hair's breadth, or caused its face to retreat an inch up the valley. Indeed, so far from any erosion being formed by this cataract, a curiously strong deposit, a sort of cascade of deposits, instantly begins from it. It builds up from the bottom of a sea, perhaps 300 feet deep, an alluvial deposit to the top of the cataract, nearly 300 feet high. This deposit, retaining always the same level at the cataract, is pushed forward in the course of 45,000 years to the end of the present delta. And \" the inevitable consequence N 2"], [196, "[Ch. XIV 180 ELLET ON Ellet's notion of the successive and progressive formation of the Delta of the Mississippi"], [197, "Ch. XIV.] 181 THE MISSISSIPPI. If this theory were true, the river once em banked would be always em banked. of this hypothesis will then be that the slope of the plane must have been at successive periods, as represented.\" \" The whole space embraced in the triangle hab, became filled up by sedi mentary accretions, and the river sloped off from H to the mouth of the Arkansas, with a descent represented by h b, more than twice as great as its present rate of descent.\" If alluvial plains were formed according to this diagram, solely down stream, or forward in the sea, from the sea shore backward on the land, the river once embanked, would be always embanked, and there would be no difficulty about it. But nothing in nature ever happened like this diagram. The left end of the line of deposits never got up to h before the right end arrived at d. Ellet has only allowed for his house being on fire at one end, whereas it is on fire at both ends. He has only raised and lengthened the line of new deposits to the right, or forward into the sea, whereas nature raises it, and lengthens it to the left also, or backward up the valley. And the present line of deposits, h d, is not by nature stationary at h, as Ellet hks made it for 45,000 years, but would be for ever rising throughout, and lengthening at both ends, unless stopped for a time (in lengthening not, N 3"], [198, "182 [Ch. XIV. ELLET ON But eternal causes neces- sitate an eternal raising of the embankments. in rising) by the foot of a rapid to the left, above h, which it will progress up, while the water wears it down. Though artificial embankments will stop this rise of deposits altogether, and even expose them to denudation, the eternal causes of the rise of deposits will be at work on the rise of the surface and bed of the river, and conse quently on the necessary rise of the artificial embankments for ever. And as long as man can play this game, the plain, instead of rising every year from overflow and deposit, will sink every year from denudation, while the surface and bed of the river will rise every year. The filling in of valleys is, as has been said, on the same principle as that which governs their scooping out. That is, it proceeds chiefly from the sea towards the hill. And the chief growth of alluvial plains in extent of area is backward or up stream on the land, not forward in the sea. That is, it is simply from the ponding back and overflow of water, which must happen where valleys which have been worn horizontal, or nearly horizontal, receive the flood-water from the inclined channels of unalluvial rivers. Commerce is nearly 300 feet above the level of the sea. The direct distance to the sea is about 500 miles. The"], [199, "Ch. XIV.] 183 THE MISSISSIPPI. slope of the land is about eight inches in the mile. By the river, the distance is about 1200 miles, the slope of the banks is about three inches in the mile. Cut off the lower 250 miles of alluvial plain, or introduce a deep estuary that distance. There would be a fall of the river into the estuary of nearly 150 feet. This would soon cut a deep channel through the soft alluvial deposits, backward to Commerce, and the river could not overflow and deposit on its banks. Clap on the lower 250 miles of deposits again, and it will overflow and deposit on its banks. Why ? because the lower 250 miles of deposits pond the river back on the upper 250 miles of deposits. Artificial banks prevent this rising of the plain, that is, of the natural banks. While, by increasing the rise of the delta in the sea, they increase the ponding back, or rising of the surface and bed of the river. Art, therefore, is not only perpetually fighting against itself, but perpetually increasing its powers against itself; that is, in the case of the Mississippi, the deposit which nature would annually spread over the surface of 40,000 square miles to raise the land against the water, art annually sends to the end of the delta to increase the rising of the n 4"], [200, "184 [Ch. XIV ELLET ON Principle of the longitudinal and lateral slopes of allu* vial plains. water against the land, while at the same time it exposes that land to denudation. There are two slopes in perpetual formation in alluvial plains. The degree of the longi tudinal slope is the result of the annual ponding back of flood-water. The degree of the lateral slope results from the dying off of deposits from moving water. The longitudinal slope is so slight that to almost all practical intents, it may be left out of calculation. But the effect of this slight difference between principle and practice, in such a basin as the Mississippi, may expose millions of men to the constant chance of death to themselves and destruction to their property from inundation, with the certainty that their actual estates are in process of be coming subterranean and themselves and their works fossil. For let the Po fill the Adriatic at a dead level, what signifies it to Ferrara ? but give a slope of eight inches in the mile from Otranto towards the Alps, and Ferrara is subterranean. When the Mississippi first began to cut its channel to the sea, which was when the land had just risen from the sea, there was no inden ture in the sweep of the shore of the gulf, nor did that shore reach up to above the Ohio, as Ellet has supposed. On the contrary, the shores"], [201, "185 Ch. XIV.] THE MISSISSIPPI. of the gulf (I do not allude to the delta) ex tended then much farther into the sea than they do now, and they have been worn back by the sea. But the line even of the present sea shore would cross the delta about New Orleans. And the very least that can be abstracted from Ellet's ancient sea is the distance between New Orleans and Commerce. This question is, as I have said, of importance, because, according to Ellet's theory and diagram, the level of the plain at the sea shore, and from thence upwards, is stationary, and it is only in the sea that the delta rises. And the rise of nearly 300 feet from New Orleans to Commerce is, according to Ellet, exceptional, as regards the plain above it, because it was raised in the sea. Whereas, in fact, it was raised on the land, by the same causes which are now raising it and all the alluvial parts above it. The only part of the delta formed in the sea is from New Orleans to the point D, in the diagram. The young river made an indenture in the sweep of the shores ; the mature river filled it in. The young river made an indenture as its estuary, or negative delta, as it is called, which must always precede a positive delta. For, as has been repeated too often, the direct operation of a river is only to cut down a deep"], [202, "186 [Ch. XIV. ELLET ON channel for itself, till that cutting down is stopped by the sea. But since this estuary was cut, rain has formed the entire valley of the Missis sippi, and the river has rolled the former contents of this valley into the sea. There is no wonder then at the largeness of the delta ; the wonder is that it is so small. It is perhaps a millionth part of what has gone into the sea. And the other 999,999 parts are now forming tertiary (or quartiary) strata, to support our descendants a million years hence. But small as the delta is, it is a pretty good lump of earth. And where does it come from, unless from the forma tion of the valley ? But the operation has not ceased. On the contrary, it increases in vigour ; and the river is not only now daily increasing the growth of the delta and the alluvial plain, by deposit from the denudation of the whole of its tributary ground, but the greater the future growth of this tributary ground, that is, of the unalluvial valley in length and in width, the greater will be the supply, not only of water, but of alluvium, and consequently the greater will be the growth ofthe delta forward into the sea, and of the alluvial plain backward up the valley. If, according to Ellet's theory and dia gram, the level of the plain upward from the sea shore, which he puts at Commerce, but"], [203, "Ch. XIV.] 187 THE MISSISSIPPI. which actually was at New Orleans, has re mained the same for 45,000 years, it may remain the same for the next 45,000 years. This is a very comfortable doctrine, because, in this case, the river once embanked is always embanked. But in fact, as has been stated, the level of a valley is never permanent in any part, and there is no part of the valley of the Mississippi subject to flood which is not raised by deposit every year, nor any part of the whole valley not sub ject to flood, or where flood is banked out, which is not lowered every year by denudation. Rock in situ in the channel of a river is no proof in general that the sea reached up to it. The river may have cut any quantity of rocky strata down to below the level of its present bed between Commerce and the Gulf, and afterwards have covered them deep under the alluvial plain, as it may hereafter the particular rock at Commerce, or any successive strata of rocks higher up the river. And the Mississippi is now, and for ever will be, going on backwards up the valley, wearing down rapids and pushing up the alluvial plain, and patches of alluvial plain. And as to the particular rock at Commerce, the river has evidently cut it down to its present level, out of the chain \" where the rocky hills approach the shore on both sides.\" And"], [204, "[Ch. XIV. 188 ELLET ON Ellet's cascade would have originally fallen from the top of these \" rocky hills \" into his sea, if it had existed. Whether the river cut its passage through these \"rocky hills\" by ponding, that is, by forming a lake behind them, like the St. Lawrence at Niagara, or without ponding, as the Weald rivers have through the North and South Downs, is probably now not to be guessed at. But the reason that these \" rocky hills \" still \" approach the shore on both sides \" is simply their hardness in comparison with the sides of the valley, above and below. They have yielded less quickly to disintegration and the wash of rain, and therefore project from the sides of the valley, from the same cause as the volcanic dikes do from the sides of the Val del Bove. If left to nature, the river might continue to erode its rocky bed at Commerce, and while this erosion was going on the alluvial plain might rise, and with it the bed of the river, and, passing clear over the rock, they might carry their uniform gradients up the valley for hun dreds of miles. The first rock \" in situ \" above Commerce would then, according to Ellet, mark where the delta began and the sea ended. Any stratum of rock which formed a barrier"], [205, "Ch. XIV.] THE MISSISSIPPI. 189 The bed of the river rises with the alluvial plain. across the valley 1000 miles above Commerce might occasion a detached patch of alluvial plain above it. Below this barrier the river might run for 100 miles over rapids, and as the river wore this bed of rocks down, and the alluvial plain progressed up the valley, this patch of alluvial plain might be joined to the lower plain, and so become the beginning of what Ellet calls the delta. Ellet contends against \" the popular belief,\" that the river raises its bed. He is constrained, however, to allow that it has done so, through the 500 miles of his own particular sea-formed delta. If it had not raised its bed between Commerce and Belize, the bed of the river now would be the same as the bed of Ellet's ancient sea ; just inside the mouth of the river there should be more than 1000 feet of water where there are now 100. And though the bed would \" slope up uniformly \" to \" above the mouth of the Ohio,\" we should then add 300 feet to the depth of the river, namely, the depth of the old cataract from \" the rock in situ.\" Ellet, how ever, gives the depth of the river there as about seventy feet. Its bed then must be upwards of 200 feet above the surface of Ellet's supposed sea, since its surface was nearly 300 feet below the rock in situ.\""], [206, "190 [Ch. XIV. ELLET ON Why alluvial rivers receive tributaries without in* crease of width. But this, according to Ellet, is only \" a has been ;\" it is exceptional, because this part of the alluvial valley was formed in the sea, which it was not. The bed of the river no longer rises ; there fore the river once embanked is always em banked. This is a frightful mistake. The causes which scooped the valley of the Missis sippi out and also filled it in, are still producing both these effects now as actively, nay, more actively, than ever. And as long as the river floods, and wherever it floods, it will deposit and raise its banks, and with them its bed. Even the present beds of the mouths of the delta will hereafter be raised as the delta progresses out to sea. As long as the end of the delta remains stationary, the depth of the mouths must be stationary to this extent, there must be suffi cient depth to let the water into the sea. But as the delta progresses forward into the sea the beds of the present mouths may rise, as the whole bed behind them does rise now, and may rise till the alluvial plain reaches the foot of the Rocky Mountains. Ellet notices, as an anomaly and a peculiarity of the Mississippi, that it receives vast tributaries without an apparent increase of width. But can that be called an anomaly which is a law in all alluvial plains ? The cause I have endea-"], [207, "Ch. XIV.] THE MISSISSIPPI. 191 voured to explain in the second edition of the \" Tree-lifter.\" Not only are the beds in un alluvial parts inclined, but the land inclines towards the banks. As floods then cannot overflow, they must tear the banks down till they can contain the largest possible flood of the river and each tributary ; and the channels of unalluvial rivers always are adapted to the flood water, and unduly large for their spring-water. But floods in alluvial rivers, instead of tearing down, build up the banks, and although they cannot build higher than themselves, each year's building increases next year's ponding, and so, without scaffolding, they may build infinitely higher than the floods of former years ; and this yearly increasing ponding not only raises the deposits on the alluvial plain, but up the un alluvial plain. The banks of an alluvial river being then high enough to accommodate the flood-water till it only just overflows, it is evident that the spring-water of each tributary, though it will increase the volume, will not in crease the width of an alluvial river. The flood water of tributaries is not contained at all, but overflows, and so increases the building of the height of the banks. If man prevents the overflow of an alluvial river, he must consider it as an unalluvial river. He cannot, indeed,"], [208, "192 ELLET ON [Ch. XIV. Cause of the shape of deltas. increase the width between the natural banks, but he may the width between the artificial banks. There seems to be a reason in nature for the shape (A) of all deltas. For the centre stream or streams, however they may vary their courses, besides causing the delta to bow out in the middle towards the sea, also cause it to bow up in the middle, along their courses. For all de- posits from moving water must die off in the direction in which the water moves. And in this case the deposits have a lateral slope from the river five or six times as great as their longitudinal slope, from ponding. Thus the water does not return over the general surface traversed, as it left the river, and so denude the banks which it has deposited. In the alluvial plain the flood-water returns to the river by particular longitudinal channels parallel to the river, which it reenters below, or by particular lateral channels cut down to the level of the spring- water. But in the delta the flood-water after depositing its load, escapes to the nearest points of the sea, along the two low outsides of the delta. In the last century a French nobleman made a bet that he would get an English horse to do twenty miles in one hour. The savans in Paris"], [209, "Ch.

And Dr. Johnson, in giving an account of the affair, concludes thus, \" Gimcrack, being no philosopher, set to work and did it.\" Dii facientes adjuvant, the English for which is \" try.\" And if the United States set to work nationally to embank the Mississippi, whatever human skill and energy can do will be effected by that great nation, but not the less for know ing the true principles of the formation of alluvial plains. If you have a powerful enemy to contend with, you may as well know his real force and his mode of attack, and what his supplies are, and also what your own weak points are. And in endeavouring to point out that the natural causes at work in the valley of the Mississippi against Ellet's magnificent schemes are greater than his estimation of them, it is not meant to argue against those schemes in particular, or against the object of those schemes in general.
