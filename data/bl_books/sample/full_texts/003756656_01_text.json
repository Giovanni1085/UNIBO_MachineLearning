The bril liant success that has attended the establishment of the Institution was not then anticipated. It was with no small degree of reluctance and timidity therefore that the Lecturer addressed a large and enlightened audience. Nor was that timidity less than the satisfaction he afterwards experienced, on being advised by those who are admitted to be capable of judging, to submit the Lectures to the public. The Lecturer has been the more willing to pub lish these outlines, since in this country, Geology is generally considered as embracing a knowledge of rocks merely, or positive geognosy ; whereas, that study, though a very interesting and valuable one, is, in fact, but a part of the science. There is no work published, it is believed, that even hints at the many important points properly treated of under the head of geology : most authors on this 2"], [18, "X subject having confined themselves to Theories and Rocks.

While we are prospering in Commerce and the Arts, it is gratifying to every liberal mind that .Science is cherished in our country, and that the great cause of intellectual improvement has be come one ofthe most popular. When the Sun of Science, towards the close of the 1 5th century, dawned on Europe, from the dark cloud, which, for nearly 400 years, had en- 3"], [24, "14 rapt intellectual progress, there were but four classics in the Royal Library of Paris : France and England were in barbarism ; America undis covered. A taste for polite literature was first spread over the west of Europe by the fall of the Eastern Empire, and the consequent dispersion of the Greeks. It was enhanced by the noble dis covery of the Art of Printing, which secured to itself the patronage afforded by the enlightened and liberal minds of a succession of Popes. They encouraged learning and the sciences, and in dis seminating them, gave full assurance of the per petuation ofthis valuable Art, and ofthe progres sive improvement of human knowledge. But Philosophy was not courted with the zeal paid to Literature : Aristotelean maxims contin ued to be universally received until the 17th cen tury, when Bacon, Lord Verulam, the profound philosopher, and most universal genius of any age, dissipated the mist of error, and threw a blaze of light on useful science, by which experiment and observation were discovered to be more convin cing than system and hypothesis. In slightly adverting, as I have done, to Peri patetic philosophy, it is unnecessary to recall your"], [25, "15 attention to the school of Plato, the father of an- cient philosophy ; or to follow the division of his school by Zenocrates and Aristotle. However delightful the task, we shall refrain from entering and enjoying the Academy of the one, nor shall we walk in the delightful suburban grove of Athens. with the other. We need not trace that philosophy which was patronised by Julius C\u00e6sar and Au- gustus ; which was taught by Alexander of Ana- phr\u0153deseus ; introduced among the Jews by Aris- tobolus, and among the Arabians by Al Mamon. To this omission I am the more reconciled, since a learned exposition of that school has already been laid before you, in the eloquent discourses of my colleague, on the history of the philosophy of the mind. I must be allowed to say, however, that it was that philosophy, which in the earliest ages of Christianity rendered itself obnoxious to the church, by its doctrine of the eternity of the world. Still it forced its way within the Chris- tian pale, and re-established its reputation : and from the 5th century the Aristotelian philosophy rose or fell with science in general, until its incon sistency with religion and true philosophy was ex posed, at the period I have mentioned, by Bacon, the father of experimental philosophy. \u2014 Bacon !"], [26, "16 unhappy name in the annals of science ! \" the wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind,\" \u2014 a blazing beacon, to show us the fallacy of man in founding his reputation on literary or scientific attainments, not supported by moral principle \u2014 to show us that genius and talents, when not connected with vir tue, \" but lead to bewilder and dazzle the blind.\" By the happy constitution of society in this country, few are enabled to devote themselves ex clusively to the study of nature. As in politics and in morals, so in literature and in science, we form individually but separate links, which, when united, become one strong chain. Like the fed eral government, which is composed of, and up held by, our different states, so the republic of literature must depend on the combined exertions of many. Our local position, our government, our freedom of religion, are all peculiar to us ; but not so our literature ; that we possess in common with Eu rope, nay, with Britain only. With different laws, opposite governments, and in different hemis pheres, America and Britain enjoy, in the same language, a common fund of literature, to which they both add according to ability, and whence they botb draw according to inclination. Accord-"], [27, "17 ingly, the Naturalists of Europe send us frequent and important acquisitions in the sciences, and we endeavour to repay the obligation by our re searches on this side of the Atlantic. It is within the recollection of many of those, whom, by the partiality of my Associates, I have now the honor of addressing, when the terms of Science were scarcely understood among us. Knowledge is not stationary : its progress is rapid, or it retrogrades. It may here be emphatically said. that \" he who is not with us, is against us.\" Mental exertion and mental improvement have kept pace with each other, until the present state of Science and Literature was perfected. The interior of our planet is occupied by shape less and numerous masses, lying on each other in a certain order. To discover their nature, arrange ment, and relations, is the part of Geology. The various substances scattered through these beds, having in common with their matrices, cer tain laws of their own, peculiar to each species, it is the business of Mineralogy to collect and de scribe. They are bodies without motion, power or life."], [28, "18 The vegitable carpet of nature, which covert our planet, \" the grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind\"' \u2014 organised bodies, with life, but no sensation, belong to the depart ment of Botany. These three departments, it will be seen, de rive much assistance from Chemistry, which treats of those events or changes in natural bodies, which are not accompanied by sensible motions. Man, made in the image of his Creator, and to whom \" He gave dominion over the fish of the sea, the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, over every living thing that moveth upon earth, over every herb, and every tree \u2014 man, with all the subordi nate and less perfect animals, is made the province of Zoology. It is my lot to treat of Geologv \u2014 and I propose at the present time to give a rapid sketch of the rise and progress of this Science, and the various Theories that have been published in illustration of it. This I am the more emboldened to do, be cause, as Stewart says, it is not from his own erro-"], [29, "19 neous hypothesis alone that the philosopher is as sisted in the investigation of truth. Similar lights are often to be collected from the errors of his pre decessors: and hence it is, that accurate histories of the different Sciences may be justly ranked among the most efficient means of accellerating their future advacement. It was from a view of the endless and hopeless wanderings of preceding enquirers, that Bacon in ferred the necessity of avoiding every beaten track: and it was this which encouraged him \u2014 with a con fidence in his own powers amply justified by the event \u2014 to explore, and to open a new path to the mysteries of nature. Inveniam viam, aut saciani. There is no subject, says Fontenelle, on which men ever come to a reasonable opinion, till they have once exhausted all the absurd views it is possible to take of it. What follies, he adds, should we not be repeating at this day, if we had not been anticipated in so many of them by the ancient philosophers. Those systems, therefore, which are lalse, are by no means to be regarded as totally useless. That of Ptolemy, as Bailly observes, is founded on a prejudice so natural and so unavoidable, that it"], [30, "20 may be considered as a necessary step in the pro gress of astronomical Science : and if it had not been proposed in ancient times, it would infallibly have preceded among the moderns, the system of Copernicus, and retarded the period of its dis covery. Should any one say that, after all, our theories are but hypothesis, I would beg you to call to mind, that it was by the happy hypothesis of a ring encircling the body of Saturn, that Huyghens ac counted in a simple and satisfactory manner for all those appearances, which for years had puzzled all the astronomers ofthe world. Ofthe accuracy of this hypothesis no reasonable doubt can be en tertained, when it not only explains all known phe nomena, but enables the astronomer to predict with accuracy those which are afterwards to be observed. The earliest published theory of the earth with which we are acquainted is that of Burnett.* He supposed that the primeval earth was a fluid mass, composed of heterogeneous materials, the heaviest of which descended to the centre, and there formed a hard and solid body. Around this * \" Telluris Theoria Sacra.\" London 1680"], [31, "21 body was collected the water: and all the lighter fluids, the air particularly, ascended above the water, and encompassed the whole. Between these orbs of water and air was an oily matter, upon which the impure earthy particles, blended with the air, descended, and uniting with it, form ed the crust of the earth, which became habitable and was the abode of men and annimals. In this state, as its equator coincided with the plane of the ecliptic, there was no variation of season \u2014 '* and one unbounded spring encircled all.\" The surface he supposed to be smooth and uni form, without mountains, seas, or inequalities \u2014 nor did it vary at all for 1 6 centuries, when the heat of the sun dried the crust, and caused it to crack into fissures or crevices, which eventually deepened and penetrated through it. These fis sures enlarged and the enclosed waters gushed out with much violence, and in such quantities, as to cover the dry land, and occasion the general deluge. The water at length retired into cavities, and as these became silled, the earth appeared in its most elevated parts, and formed mountains, while the lower parts remained covered by water. and formed vallies, oceans, &c. t"], [32, "22 The beauty of language in which Burnett cloth ed his theory enabled him to throw a kind of splen dour over his erroneous ideas, which forced them for a time into general acceptance. It has been asserted, I know not upon what authority, that this theory had been previously published by Francis co Patrizio, a professor at Rome, in a dialogue called \" II Lamberto.\" It is generally viewed as an elegant Romance ; the product of mere imagi nation, unsupported by any observed phenomena. About the same period the celebrated Leibnitz published his '\u2022 Protog\u0153a,\" in which he holds that the earth and all planets were originally fixed and luminous stars, which for ages had blazed in the firmament, until the combustible matter was ex hausted, when they lost their brilliancy, and became opaque bodies. The fire, by fusing the earthy matter, vitrified it, so that the base of all things belonging to the earth is glass, ol which sand and gravel are fragments. The other earths are a combination of sand with water and salts. When this crust cooled, the aqueous particles, which had arisen as vapour, were condensed and pre cipitated, forming the ocean. These at first covered 'all the earth, and the shells and other marine products are proofs of the fact."], [33, "23 Woodward next appears on the list of theorists.* He observed several phenomena with attention, but was only partial in his observations. He notic ed marine exuvi\u00e6, and supposed them left on land by the subsidence of the ocean. That while the waters of the deluge covered the earth, all solid substances were held by them in a state of solu tion. That eventually a precipitation of all mat ters occurred in the order of their specific gravity \u2014 the heaviest first, and the rest in order. That consequently these strata were all parallel and spherical, and encompassed entirely by the great ocean. That in the course of time some power ful internal agent broke these strata universally, and changed their relative positions, elevating some and depressing others \u2014 thus producing mountains and valleys : \u2014 in fine forming the earth as it now exists. It is not necessary, in the present state of this science, to urge arguments against this or the pre ceding theory. Suffice it to say, that the mere existence of beds of light substances placed be neath many of greater specific gravity is at once an objection that eannot be removed. * Essay towards the Natural History ofthe Earth and terres tial bodies by John Woodward M. D. London 1702."], [34, "24 The internal agent alluded to by Woodward was probably the same mentioned by Dr. Hook, who in his \" Discourse on Earthquakes,\" publish ed in 1688, assumes that the bottom of the sea had been elevated by these tremendous convul sions of nature, caused by subterranean fires ; and he thus accounts for the existence of shells on the summits of mountains. Dr. Halley* ascribes the deluge to the shock of a comet, or some transient body, by which the polar and diurnal rotation was immediately chan ged, causing thereby a great agitation in the sea. Thus he accounts for all the strange varieties ot position we see on the surface of the earth ; as high mountains standing on beds of shells that were once the bottom of the ocean, &c. &c. It may be observed that so violent a shock would cause all fluids to run instantly to the part where such a blow was given, and with such a power as to carry along with it the bottom of the ocean.\u2014 But then the deluge must have been produced very rapidly, and by no means in the gradual way in which we are taught to believe that it happen- * Phil. Trans. No. 383"], [35, "25 ed, both by scripture, and the observance of phe nomena. Catching the idea of Halley, and blending with it the views of his predecessors, of Woodward more particularly, Whiston erected his theory* on mathematical calculation, founded on his as sumed data. He endeavours to show, that on the first day of the deluge, a comet, descending in the plane of the ecliptic, towards its perihelion, pas sed just before the earth, and, coming below the moon, caused, by its power on the tides, the el liptic figure of the earth ; which broke, and the waters, issuing through the crevices or fissures, produced the deluge, in conjunction with the rain that descended from the comet on its return. At first, the author advanced all this by way of hypothesis only, but afterwards became persua ded ofthe truth of a conjecture, for which there is not the least semblance of foundation. In 1 740, Lazoro Moro, an Italian, is said to have brought forward the idea, that not only mountains, but the whole earth was raised from the bottom * .'<* New Theorv ofthe Earth.\" London 1708."], [36, "26 of the ocean by the power ot combustion, that commenced soon after the creation. That the portions of earth which now exhibit no marine shells, were elevated before the fish had stocked the ocean; but that afterwards shells and fish were thrown up, and deposited in strata along with the soil. This theory has been adopted at a later period. De la Pryme* supposes that the Antideluvian world had, besides mountains, rivers, &c. an ex ternal sea, and that the falling in of immense in ternal caverns, accompanied by earthquakes. swallowed up most or all of it, leaving the seas only visible. From the bottom of this sea arose our present earth, in the same way that some islands have been swallowed down, and others thrust up in their stead, even in the present day. There are many valuable and interesting facts in accordance with this theory, which has been partially upheld by Mr. King, at a much later pe riod.!

We can scarcely believe, however, that the for mer world was completely destroyed, as is suppo sed by M. Deluc, who enlarged on this hypothe sis, since we are told that Moses took the appear ance of an olive branch to be a sign of the dimi nution of the flood. This could not have been supposed to be a submarine production ; nor are we at liberty to suppose it the produce of an isl and that had escaped the general inundation. In 1 746 Guettard first complied with the wishes of Lister, who, in 1684, recommended the adop tion of geological maps. He was one of the first writers who seems to have forsaken cosmogony, and applied himself to geological enquiries. He possessed, for that period, much important infor mation, which led him to pretty correct conclu sions : for instance, he formed 3 divisions of the earth's surface. The first he called Schistose, which embraced the primary rocks ; \u2014 secondly"], [38, "28 the Marls, which included the secondary, pretty generally ; and thirdly, Sand, coinciding with what is now termed tertiary. His views were too ex tensive for the state of the science at the time in which he lived. Lehman, who directed his mind to this subject, soon discovered and demonstrated the distinction between primary and secondary rocks, illustrating his ideas by the geology of the Hartz. Like the peasant of Virgil, who imagined his native hamlet the miniature of imperial Rome, Lehman imagined the Hartz and the Erzeberge a miniature of the world. It is needless to say that they were about equally correct. Mr. Whitehurst studied diligently some parts ot England, for many years, and being a close ob server, he collected very many facts, whence he proceeded to erect a theory,* in which the two great agents are expansion and gravity : the for mer derived from internal fire, and the latter from an accumulation of earthy particles. The expansive force at last gaining the ascendency, *\" Inquiry into the original state and formation ofthe earth.\" 1786."], [39, "29 broke through the superincumbent mass, and forced up the strata in all directions. The globe was afterwards broken into comparative fragments by the explosion of steam, and the primitive state of the earth completely changed : and even the Alps, Pyrenneess and Andes thus brought from the abyss. For the truth of his opinions the author refers to fossils. There is some romance, and much valuable information in his book. Kirwan, an Irish philosopher of strong mind and extensive erudition, not believing in the theo ries of his predecessors, turns at once to the ac count of Moses, as the only one consistent with actual phenomena ; and ascribes the Deluge to a supernatural cause \u2014 the express intention of God to punish the crimes of mankind. He says the deluge was a miraculous effusion of water from the clouds and from the great abyss, and which was sufficient to cover the whole earth. This he establishes by a reference to the laws of the New tonian theory. Having proved this fact, he pro ceeds to state that the deluge commenced in the great southern ocean, below the equator, and rushed thence to the northern hemisphere.* He * Vide Trans. of Roy. Ir. Acad, vol. 6 5"], [40, "30 brings the following arguments in support oi his views, viz. \u2014 1. That the southern ocean is the largest col lection of water on the globe. 2. In northern latitudes we observe the remains of animals from the southern continents and ocean, but in southern climates no remains of northern animals of land or water. 3. The traces of a violent shock from the south are still visible in many countries. 4. The shape of continents, all sharpened to the south, where they are washed by the southern ocean, indicate the force of the shock, which mountains only could withstand ; such as the cape of Good Hope \u2014 cape Comorin \u2014 the south point of New Holland and Patagonia. It will be observed that Kirwan endeavoured to go by the Mosaic account ; which, although not intended, as some writer remarks, as a geolo gical record, is still upheld by the geology of the present day. We do not believe, with some authors, that it indicates presumption, to scan the works of the Almighty,\u2014 to attempt explanations of the delude, or any physical cause,\u2014 nor to offer conjectures as to the results. His power was wonderfullv and"], [41, "31 miraculously displayed in that awful catastrophe, for the completion of which the operation of phy sical causes seems to have been direeted, and the laws of nature to have been suspended. In study ing the manner in which these changes were wrought, or their ultimate effects, we see no pre sumption, no doubt of the omnipotence of the Ruler, no disbelief in the wisdom of the Allwise Sovereign. As no theory that had been issued came clothed in the beauties of language or boldness of concep tion comparable to that of M. Buffon, so none has ever been so popular, for the fund of information it contains. The prominent points only can be hinted at. He supposes that the Earth and other planets formed, originally, parts of that glorious orb. whence we. at least, derive our light and heat \u25a0 and to have been detached by an oblique stroke of a comet. These portions of igneous matter, forced thus from the Sun, assumed a globular shape by the attraction of cohesion, and receded to such a distance as to allow them to gain an eliptical motion round the parent Sun, where they are now retained by the conjoined effect of cen-"], [42, "32 tripetal and centriiugal forces. By the rotary motion, and the fluidity of matter, the earth gra dually became an oblate spheriod. It eventually cooled, and the aqueous atmosphere condensing by degrees, descended upon the surface in form of water. This water deposited sulpherous, sa line, and other matters, which entering into fis sures, &c., formed metallic veins and minerals: and part resting on the surface, produced mould. The internal part, he says, were, and still are vitrified : the upper surface, being pumice and scori\u00e6, were acted on by the water and other agents, and produced clays and soil. In this state the tides and the winds and the heat of the sun began to produce strong effects. The diurnal motion of the earth, and the poAver of the tides. elevated the waters around the Equator, and car ried there, from higher latitudes, great quantities of slime, sand, clay, S,-c, thus elevating the equa torial, and depressing the polar regions. Thus. he says, we observe the highest mountains within the tropics, and there the irregularities of surface generally are greater than at the poles. The ac tion of water in the scori\u00e6, produced excavations in some places, and elevations in others, which in course of time formed islands and continents."], [43, "33 The destruction of mountains, and the formation. of new islands, with all the various positions of strata, so unaccountable by all other theories, he endeavours to reconcile by the chaotic confusion thus produced. The bottom of the sea, he says, resembles, in its regularity, all the varieties of inequality, of hill and dale, earth and rock, that we observe on dry land. Its plants and shrubs have a similar regular distribution. As we find under the equator the highest mountains, so there do we find the deepest seas. Incontrovertible facts, he thinks, prove, that as the dry and habitable portion of the earth has been once for a long period under water, so similar changes are now going on at the bottom of the ocean, which will eventually be come dry land: but not in an immense period. since the operation of like causes do not produce like effects in the same time now as formerly. All continents and islands have their mountains in the centre, dividing them longitudinally. From these the rivers run perpendicularly to the ocean. in which they empty, wearing away mountains. producing vallies, and making deposits at their mouths, which are carried into the ocean, to form new beds, new islands, and new continents : and"], [44, "34 eventually to restore to the dominion ol ocean the realms which are now beyond its waters \u2014 and whose rocky barriers and broken coasts seem to hold the language of the flatterers of Canute\u2014 \u00ab thus far shalt thou come, and no farther.\" In noticing this theory, I must be allowed to say, that it was only about the time of its pub lication, that Geology first claimed the rank of a science. Before this period, scarcely an accurate idea had been formed on the subject. The few rays of light were scattered, until an unexpected nucleus attracted the wandering atoms, and drew them together. The brilliant genius of Buffon diffused a radiance on philosophical enquiries. It wasted itself in unprofitable theories, but threw a distant light upon the practical enquirer. This is the only subject on which the splendid genius of the naturalist shed no immediate light : smaller stars, however, were rendered perceptible by his reflected rays. All these theories are vague, and insufficient to account for existing facts ; besides that they par take too much of the ancient cosmogony for the present day. There are but two other theories of consequence; and these we shall but slightly touch upon, intend ing in the course of our duties to refer to them sepa-"], [45, "35 rately, and view their opposing principles. 1 shall have been anticipated by many of you when I mention that these are the celebrated theories of Dr. Hutton of Edinburgh, and of Prof. Werner of Freyburg. Dr. Hutton published his theory in 1788. He considers the Earth as a mere machine \u2014 describes its mechanism \u2014 and enumerates the powers by which motion is produced, and activity communicated to it. These are the projectile power, gravitation, the influence of light, heat, cold, condensation, electricity, and magnetism. Observing that a solid body of land could not answer the purposes of an inhabitable world with out a soil suited for vegitation, he says that this soil is formed merely by the decomposition of the solid earth. The surface inhabited by man. and covered by plants and animals is made by Nature to decay \u2014 that the interior constantly fur nihes soil which is as constantly washed away by the continual action of water running from the mountains to the ocean : that thus heights are levelled, fertile plains formed from the disintegra tion of mountains and rocks, and the materials carried on to the abyss of ocean. This soil is constantly formed and removed, and thus the kind"], [46, "36 tending constantly to destruction. To counteract this Dr. H. supposes the constitution of the globe to possess a reproductive operation, by which this ruined and decayed world becomes again repair ed ; and that the apparent destruction ofthe earth's surface is in fact the real cause of its renovation' While this change is going on, new strata become consolidated by internal heat : all solid land is formed at the bottom of the sea, and elevated by fire, inaccessible to be sure to human observation. but still existing and operating. Simple fusion, then, is considered as giving hardness and solidity to the different strata that have been condensed by means of it. According to this Theory the se condary and newer rocks were deposited at the bottom of the ocean, in consequence of operations similar to those now in action, and the primary were formed beneath, by internal fire. All mar bles, limestones, &e, are composed of the calca reous matter of marine animals. In this theory there is a happy union of the agency of both fire and water ; the one collecting and depositing, the other consolidating and ele vating. This system is in unison with many facts as seen in Scotland where it originated. It has been ably"], [47, "37 supported by the elegant illustrations of Professor Playfair. That classic scholar could see the ordina ry operations of nature producing Geological phe nomena, through an infinite succession of ages' without beginning and without end. The subject has been rendered interesting, independant of its author, by these illustrations, which are said to display advantageously its principles, argue forci bly in its favor, ingeniously combat the objections^ and apparently establish its own conclusions. This book continues to be the text book of the best English Geologists. It will be remarked that this theory embraces. many of the points held out by the philosophy of Aristotle, which, as formerly remarked, secured to itself, by its doctrine ofthe eternity of the world, the severest censures ofthe Fathers of the chris- tian church. It was about this time that Saussure visited and studied the Alps, whence he drew conclusions the most important to Geology. While he was thus engaged, Pallas was traversing the Russian em pire, and, with the zeal of a master, accumulating facts for the establishment of the science. 6"], [48, "38 Werner, a name almost revered in Germany, now appeared on the list of Geologists. As he pub lished but little himself, his intrinsic merits can never be properly estimated. It is to be regretted that his apathy prevented him from publishing. His antipathy to the mechanical part of writing was so excessive as to be amusing. Nothing could finally induce to write a line; and to avoid reproaching himself with want of politeness, he at last would not open thc letters addressed to him. A certain author Avho wished to consult many philosophers respecting a voluminous work, circu lated his manuscript and it was lost; after a thousand researches, it was disinterred at last, from among an hundred others, in possession of Werner. When the French Academy placed him among its eight foreign associates, an honor coveted by thc most illustrious philosophers of Europe, he never opened his letters, and became acquainted with his hon ors through an Almanack. And to crown all, an express whicli his sister had sent, to him from Dres den, waited two months, at an inn, at his expense, waiting his simple signature to some very pressing family concerns. He had sent his \u00ab System\" to \"he press, but could never endure the fatigue of"], [49, "39 correcting the first proof sheet. We knoAV it, therefore, only as promulgated by his pupils ; who looked upon him as the genius of his age, and bliydly Avorshipped at his feet. They supposed that his ideas formed at once a mature system, el- egant and perfect, they termed it geognosie, and inscribed on it the name of Werner. To this merit he Avas not entitled. He had a strong mind, which Avas divided, and gave its Avhole strength to minerals and systems. Method Avas his hobby. He was foud of dividing and classifying, and latterly bought books, not to study, but to arrange them in a certain order in his Library. He is said to have debated alike on the order of his dinner table and the arrangement of his cabinet, and even traced the military art by the laAvs of geology. '' A man,\" said he, \" who Avishes to become a great General should begin his education by studying Oryctognosy and Geognosy, at Freyburg.\" It was his love of system and division that induced him to add to the primary and secondary, the interme- diate transition, which has been likened to the in- creasing of primary colors by the addition of mix ed tints. He multiplied divisions, but he did not strengthen them. His great error was in suppo sing that Saxony and Bohemia Avere the world in"], [50, "40 miniature. Like Lehman, he supposed that what he had seen was all the Avorld afforded : and that he had sufficient data in his own country whence to draw conclusions as to the universal structure ofthe world. None but his most attached pupils noAV uphold his theories, which he carried beyond the bounds of philosophy. His ardent zeal, however, diffused itself among his adherents, and he may justly be said to have done more than any other man for the advancement of Geology. We have been detained, however, too long by the man, from his Avorks. He threAV aside hypothesis, and dreAv his arguments from facts. His first proposition was that the Earth, to some depth, Avas originally fluid \u2014 not from fusion by heat, but from aqueous solution. These outlines are these : I. The surface of the globe Avas originally soft or fluid, as inferred from its present shape, and geological phenomena. 2. That for centuries after its creation the earth contained in its inner parts immense empty ca verns, but sufficiently solid to bear the superin cumbent mass. 9. The materials composing the earth Mere at one period dissolved, and held in solution by wa-"], [51, "41 ter, Avhence they have been consolidated and pre cipitated, partly by crystalization and partly by mechanical deposition ; granite first, and the oth er primary rocks in order, principally by chemical precipitation. 4. From this date the Avaters rapidly subsid ed, retiring into the cavities of the earth. During this period other strata, the oldest secondary, (or transitions were deposited. 5. The further subsidence of the waters occa sioned, by mechanical action, a partial disintegra tion, which furnished materials to unite Avith those still held in solution, which were then precipitated and formed the secondary horrizontal beds, abun dant in organic remains. 6. During the gradual diminution ofthe AAraters, and the consequent hardening of the strata, rents and crevices Avere formed, into which the Avaters entered, still holding in solution metals, &c. &c. Avhence arise metallic veins and beds of metals. 7. That volcanoes and depositions from water are still producing changes on the earth's surface. From the time of Pallas, Saussure, Hutton and Werner, the neAV science, which had lately arisen under the proud tittle of the theory of the earth, attracted the notice it merited. Celebrated men"], [52, "42 became its pupils, and we find Humboldt, Cuvier, Daubuisson, Brongniart, Van Buch, Brochant, Brocchi and Maclure, Avith many others, giving their time to perfecting it : each adding his obser vations to the scale of one of the great masters, whence have been derived the absurd titles of Wernerian and Huttonian, or Neptunian and Plu tonic Theories. The one attributing most geologi cal phenomena to ingenious, the other to aqueous origin. Both are imperfect. Future observations will add valuable facts, and perhaps accumulated evidence Avill weigh in favour of the aqueous ori- gin of most rocks. Whatever may appear from a transcient glance, a complete examination of the opposing theories cannot leave the mind biassed much in favour of either. To the Huttonian theory, says Dr. Murray, its most violent opponent, belongs the praise of novelty, boldness of conception, and extent of views. Its author has aspired not merely to ac count for the present appearances of the earth, but to trace a system, in which the formation of suc cessive Avorlds is developed : he has sought to ex tend that order and arrangement, that principle of balance and restoration, observed in all the de-"], [53, "43 partments of nature, to the constitution ofthe globe itself, and he has succeeded in drawing an outline Avhich gratifies the imagination Avith the semblance of grandeur and design. An enumeration of the arguments in favour of this theory cannot be necessary to you. Suffice it to acknowledge that the relative position of mine ral masses, their constituent parts, and the peculi arity of fossils render inadmissable the idea of a central fire, existing Avithout an assignable cause from eternity, and producing effects by no means commensurate with its poAver. We are not Iioav cver to underate the agency of subterranean com bustion : The knoAvn existence of nearly two hundred volcanic openings is sufficient proof of the extent of internal fires : and the vast distance at Avhich the shocks they occasion have been sensibly felt, give some idea ofthe extent of their force, which even an intervening ocean cannot restrain. The opposing theory, to which the name of Werner has been improperly attached, forms a simple contrast to improbable hypothesis. That the surface of the earth has been arranged by water, is proved by a knoAvledge of geological facts. In appealing to proofs from induction, avc find ac tual phenomena in accordance with principles."], [54, "44 Perfection is not attainable in all things : while any science therefore remains in a state of imper fection, deficiencies must be discovered in the ap plication of principles established by induction only. Such is the case with this theory, yet it of fers no inconsistencies, contradicts no facts. It is a series of inductions, more or less perfect, re ferred to a common principle, and occasionally connected by a moderate and rational hypothesis. It will have been noticed by all of you that no attempt has been made to explain the present ap pearances ofthe earth's surface without allusion to a period when it Avas inundated. No theorist has advanced an opinion in Avhich such an event does not form one of the most prominent features. It becomes necessary, therefore, for one moment, to turn our attention to that epoch, one of the most remarkable in chronology. Previous to the general deluge, we find by sacred and profane history, that there were several great floods : of Avhich that happening in Greece, during the reign of Deucalion, is one of the most conspi cuous. It is said to have occurred 1529 years B. C. \u2014 being the third year before the Israelites left Egypt \u2014 (or 1 503 according to Blairs chronology.} This flood inundated all Thes..ally."], [55, "45 296 years before this flood, viz. 1020 years*befbre the 1st Olympiad, and 1796 years B. C. \u2014 occurr ed the deluge of Ogyges, Avhich ravaged Attica. These floods have occasionally been confound ed Avith that of Noah. There are other floods on record, Avhich may be barely named \u2014 The deluge in Syria which in 1095 A. D. drowned vast numbers of people \u2014 that which in 1164 deluged Friesland \u2014 and that Avhich 1218 deluged the same country and destroyed 100.000 men. The Netherlands and Brabant have been seve ral times inundated and their Avhole surface mate rially changed. The deluge, however, to which geologists allude, is distinguished as the universal or Noah's flood \u2014 and is recorded in scripture (Gen. 6 and 7th ch.) as sent by way of punishment for the vices and cor ruption of that age. The period of its occurrence is stated by the best chronologers, to have been 1656 years after the creation, or 2348 years B. C. \u2014 and 4173 from the present year. On the 10th day of the second month, which answers to Sunday, Nov. 30th, Noah and his family entered the Ark. On Sunday Dec. 7"], [56, "46 7th, the rain commenced, and continued for forty days. On Wednesday May 6th (2348 B. C.) thc ark rested on mount Arravat. The tops of th. mountains became visible on Sunday, July 19th, and on Friday, Dec. 18th, Noah and family left the ark, and built an altar to God. One hundred and fifty days therefore is the period it lasted \u2014 and during this time many of those changes took place which it is in some mea sure our object to account for. It is a remarkable fact that this event is pre served in the memory of all nations. In our country, as well as in Africa, Asia, and Europe. We are indeed told that the Gentoo traditions. neither written nor oral, make any mention of it, and that the Bramins assert it never took place in Hindoostan. Were this true, it would necessarily excite astonishment, since traditions of it have been traced in every quarter; not only among the Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Babylonians, Persians and Scythians, but among our OAvn Iroquois. among the Mexicans, Brazilians and Persians. But Sir Win. Jones asserts that traditions con cerning a deluge do exist from Hisdoostan, and that their oldest mythological works preserved an account very similar to that of Moses."], [57, "47 It is asserted that some traveller, interrogating the inhabitants of Otaheite as to their origin, re ceived for answer, that a long time ago, the su preme God, being angry, dragged the earth through the sea, and their island being broken off, was alone preserved. I am not here however, to defend or uphold the accounts related in the Bible. It is a history hoAv ever, which does derive support from Geology. Although no geological theory has been broach ed on this side ofthe Atlantic, it is with much plea sure that I am enabled to turn our thoughts home- Avard, from the splendid constellation of European science, and survey the rapid strides of this branch in our own country. T\\venty years ago Geology was known here by name only. It was about that period that the late Dr. Bruce returned from Europe with a splendid collection of mine rals. His zeal and attainments, with the conjoin ed efforts of Col. Gibbs, gave an eclat to the study of mineralogy, appropriately termed the alpha bet of Geology, which has produced the most beneficial effects. It is needless to enumerate the long list of those who have since successfully pro moted the interests and diffused the knowledge of mineralogy, serving as the foundation of geology."], [58, "48 It is not more than fifteen years since Ave had the first intimation through the press, that any of our citizens had observed the geological pheno mena of our country. Dr. Mitchill and Dr. Arkerly Avere among the foremost to enlighten us on the subject, in the first purely scientific jour nal established in our country.* Since then, Ave have been annually enriched by the exertions of our friends. No great standard work has yet been given on the geology of America ; but the partial labours of individuals will soon afford am ple materials for filling up the outlines uoav so Avell known, and which are more distinctly mark ed than in any other country. The observations attached to the American edition of Cuvier's theory of the earth, and the numerous notices of the learned annotator in vari ous periodicals have thrown abroad much infor mation on the formation of North America. The Essays ofthe indefatigable President of the Academy of Natural Sciences, at Philadelphia, have done much to advance this Science, and many of the members of that highly respectable society are zealously engaged in the same cause. * American Mineralogical Journal"], [59, "49 Mr. Hayden has published a vast accumulation of facts to prove that the Avhole region skirting the the Atlantic ocean is the result of the operation of Currents. He attaches much importance to this region, and has partially marked out the most in teresting formation that we possess : I mean the Tertiary. The author has evinced a knowledge of his subject which it would be well for those to possess who oppose his views. Dr. Akerly's Geology of the Hudson has been long before the public. Mr. Pierce has described part of New Jersey and the Catskill mountains. To Mr. Hitchcock Ave owe a minute and inter teresting sketch of the Geology and Mineralogy of the Connecticut river. The Exploring Expedition sent by Government, under command of Major Long, to the Rocky Mountains, has greatly added to our knoAvledge of the secondary region to the west and north. The gentlemen engaged in establishing the boundary line under the 6th and 7th articles ofthe Treaty of Ghent have afforded neAv information"], [60, "50 concerning the country about the great Lakes and to the north west. Major Delafield, agent of the U. States, under those articles, and Dr. Bigsby of the British Medical Staff, attached to the com mission, have laid us under many obligations by their very valuable contributions to our knowledge of that interesting region. Mr. Schoolcraft is noAv engaged in the publica tion of a work from Avhich we may expect to de rive much valuable information relative to the geological structure of our western country. To the Hon. Maj. Gen. Van Rensselaer, whose enlighted mind, and liberal views interest him in all branches of knowledge, we owe Geological and Agricultural Surveys of the district adjoining the Erie Canal and of the counties of Albany and Rensselaer. Individual observations on particular regions are thus connecting links for the formation of one grand chain, which will eventually embrace all the strata, beds, veins, and minerals of our continent. The bold outline of our primary range of coun try first attracted the notice of our geologists. The secondary has been explored in the grand with tolerable accuracy."], [61, "51 The alluvial has received a portion of attention ; indeed under this term has been included until of late, the vast tertiary formation situate between the alleganies and the atlantic. The vast number of beautiful fossils that we are constantly receiving from our secondary and ter tiary formations go far towards proving that many of our rocks are precisely of similiar formation with many of those of Europe, and afford new proofs of the value of these remains as geological characters. Allow me, for one moment, in concluding this sketch of Theories, to draw your attention to the striking similarity of the Records of Sacred His tory, and the phenomena of Geology. Upon a comparison, I think you will coincide with me in the assertion, that the Mosaic account ofthe struc ture of our globe is fully corroborated by the evidence afforded by the Science Avith which we are now engaged. The account in Genesis maybe summed up in three articles. 1st. That God was the original creator of all things. 2d. That at the foundation of the globe we in habit, the whole of its materials Avere in a state of chaos and confusion."], [62, "52 3. That at a period not exceeding 5000 years, (according to both Septuagint and Hebrew Chroni cle) the whole earth underwent a mighty catastro phe, in Avhich it Avas completely inundated by the immediate agency of the Deity, and all its inhabi tants destroyed, except the remnant miraculously preserved to continue the species. If to these great outlines ofthe sacred historian, we add that the materials of the globe Avere in a fluid state pre vious to its organization and that its organization Avas gradual, Ave embrace all the important points comprised in the Records \u2014 and all that the most zealous believer in inspiration is bound to main tain. Letus now look to the phenomena of Geology, and see the conclusions draAvn from their study and examination. These conclusions, condensed from the observations of Cuvier, the most acurate naturalist of the present day, may also be com prised under three heads. 1st. That the sea has atone period or other not only covered all our plains, but remained there for a long time and in a state of tranquility. 2d. That there has been at least one change in the basin of the sea which preceded ours : it has experienced at least one revolution."], [63, "53 3d. That the particular portions of the earth, Avhich the sea has abandoned by its last retreat, had been laid dry once before, and had at that time pro duced quadrupeds, birds, plants, and all kinds of terrestial productions : it had been inundated by the sea, which has since retired from it, and left it to the possession of its own proper inhabitants. Thus we see that the accounts of Moses, and the results attained by Geology, or the study ofthe structure of the world, coincide, and derive light and support from each other. 1. The prevalence of the waters at the period of the Creation described by Moses : 2. The separation of the land from the water, producing a revolution in the basin of the sea : 3. The irruption of the sea over the continent, are satisfactory coincidences between the Sacred Historian and the Geologist. fi"], [64, "LECTURE II.

A perfect Theory of the Earth, Avere it established, AA-ould undoubtedly admit of the most important applications, and a succession of Theoretical discussions may not less contribute to its attainment, than the accumulation of facts. With these last it is more particularly our business to be now engaged. The utility of Geology is evinced by the zeal, Avith which, in different parts of the Avorld, it is cultivated. And independent of the gratification Ave always feel in being able to lay open to ob servation the Laws of Nature, that tend only to inspire feelings of reverence and love to the great and good Being Avhose Avisdom is so conspicuous to all, it is of the greatest practical importance to the Miner, to the Farmer, and to the Architect. To miners, and consequently to all those man ufactures connected Avith the metals and treasures of the earth, it offers the surest means of success, by teaching in Avhat rock or position Ave may ex-"], [67, "57 pect to find mineral treasures : \u2014 that some rocks never contain them : \u2014 that metallic substances run generally in veins, and are found only in certain rocks, and in connection with certain other sub stances. That coal, for instance, is never found in the primary rocks, nor in the tertiary, nor in the alluvial formations \u2014 consequently, it is found only the secondary ; \u2014 and a knoAvledge of this class of formations teaches us, that it is found on ly in the older of its series ; as with sandstone, shale, (argillaceous slate) marl, argillaceous porphyry \u2014 argillaceous iron ore ; and of these, most commonly with sandstone, shale, and pud dingstone. It teaches the agriculturalist whence to procure substances to benefit his land, and to render it fertile ; and leads him to choose such portions of soil as by their composition and associations are best fitted for his purpose. The subject of Mineral Manures has not receiv cd in this country the attention it merits. The practical utility and value of this knowledge has been fully evinced in NeAv-Jersey : in illustration of which I may. mention a fact, which came par tially within my OAvn observation."], [68, "58 A few years since, the inhabitants of a small village in Monmouth county, finding that all the labour they could bestow upon their lands did not render them productive, and that they could not force \" the churlish soil to yield them bread,\" resolved to desert the place of their na tivity, and seek a more friendly soil. The dis covery of marie, hoAvever, having been made, and mentioned to them, they resolved to give it a trial, and found it to succeed to admiration, and far be yond their hopes. Land that for nearly a century had been considered as Avithout value, was soon converted into fertile fields, yielding abundant and valuable crops. The consequence has been, that the same labour which would scarcely afford sub sistence, now offers Avealth and contentment. The lands of the county are said to be Avorth at least one million of dollars more since the disco very and use of this mineral substance. The useful operation of Draining Land, another subject of vast importance to the agriculturalist, depends in a great measure upon a proper know lege ofthe structure ofthe Earth, and ofthe vari ous strata of which it is composed ; as well as their relative degrees of porosity, or capability of ad mitting or rejecting the passage of water through"], [69, "59 them : and likewise the modes in which bodies of Avater are formed, and conducted from different elevations. The same observations may be applied to Springs, as it is owing to these chiefly that Drain ing becomes necessary : and as they consist simply of Avater gliding along betAveen inclined strata, it is evident, that a knowledge of these strata is essential to the detection of Springs, and their con version to useful and ornamental purposes. Thus in some situations, Springs are only found on one side of a mountain \u2014 in other eminences occasion ally on all sides of them. In searching for Springs. therefore, is it necessary to examine the strata of the country. It is only by this knowledge that we can explain the phenomena, of the different kinds of Springs: \u2014 as the perennial, that flows constant ly : the temporary, flowing only at particular sea sons; the intermittent, that flows and stops, then and stops flows again ; the reciprocating spring, that rises and falls, or ebbs and flows at regular in tervals \u2014 called also ebbing and flowing wells ; of oozing and weeping Springs \u2014 and many others of this kind. To the Architect, and to the citizen who em ploys him for the purposes of ornament or comfort."], [70, "60 this study teaches truths that are but too often tor gotten. The want of attention to this subject in pub lic works, is a matter always of deep regret. Monu ments of Art \u2014 monuments intended to commemo rate a great or heroic action, should be so con structed as to remain for ages the admiration of mankind : yet Ave often find them erected of per ishable materials, and scarcely surviving the artists Avho constructed thera. It would not be in place to advert here to the origin of the use of stone in architecture or in sta tuary, nor to point out the most appropriate for those purposes. These will be hinted at in our description of Rocks, should we have time. I must observe, however, that in the erection of both public and private buildings we are lamentably de ficient in respect to beauty, durability, or the inter est of prosperity. We take our materials because they are near at hand, because they are cheap. and because others take the same, in preference to searching out others, which although at a dis tance and more expensive, are more durable and much more beautiful : which has given rise to the observation, that the ancients built, in their full ness of heart, for posterity; but that we are more selfish, and build only for ourselves,"], [71, "61 Such was the care of the ancients to procure lasting materials for their public Avorks, that had it not been for the unrelenting cupidity, and more than gothic barbarism of modern collectors, \u2014 more unrelenting than the destroying tooth of time, or the destruction of war, To rive what Goth, and Turk, and Time had spared, What envious Eld forebore, and Tyrants left to stand, many Grecian and Roman temples would have re mained perfect to the present day, not effected by the war of elements for more than 2000 years. Scarcely one building in Europe or America, of modern construction, at the end of 1000 years will have one stone lest upon another stone, to de note the place where it stood. And the most splendid works of modern architecture are even now hastening to decay, from want of attention to this subject. The elegant chapel of Henry VU. near Westminster Hall, in London, is an illustra tion of this sad truth. In the short space of 300 years, all the beautiful ornament with which the exterior was so lavishly adorned, has crumbled away. I saw the workmen, a few years since, in serting new stones on which the sculpture was copied, in place of those that were decayed ; but from the same want of judgment in the choice of 9"], [72, "62 materials, the present casing will not last longer than the original. In our various excursions in the country, most, if not all of us, have observed, no doubt, that we seldom travel far over the same kind of rock ; but that they usually alternate or vary. The great rock masses or beds, are very sel dom exactly horizontal, and still less often do Ave find them perpendicular : they all have some in clination to the horizon \u2014 thus The angle with the horizon is called the Dip\u2014 and the edge that appear on the surface is called the Basset, or cropping out. Upon an attentive examination of these strata Ave perceive that their position, their ingredients, and their associations vary materally from each other; that each has certain peculiarities of its own but that several of them have many laws in com-"], [73, "63 mon with others, their neighbours. This has led to a division and classification of rocks, which has been variously altered and modified. Lehman, as before stated, first divided the rocks into the older or primitive, which contain no or ganic remains, or petrifactions, as they are called, and into the secondary, in Avhich he included all other rocks. A very judicious division, for the period in which it was made. To these, as before remarked, Werner, added the Transition, (or those which contain only a few or ganic remains) and called those secondary rocks containing many remains Fl\u0153tz, because he thought them horizontal. His pupils again divided this class \u2014 and made the later rocks into a new class, which they called Newest Fl\u0153tz \u2014 embracing many that are now termed Tertiary. Another classification has been lately proposed in that excellent work \" on the Geology of Eng and and Wales,\" by Messrs. Conybeare and Phil lips, viz. : \u2014"], [74, "64 These divisions are the same with those gene rally recognised by geological writers, excepting that the _d is by some combined Avith the second \u2014 by others with the fourth, but all geological anal ogies and relations are grossly violated by the for mer of these methods ; and though the latter is less open to objection, yet Ave shall best consult that convenience to the student which itis the great object of all such arrangements to promote, by as signing to so important a series a distinct place in the general system.

Regarding the Car boniferous as the middle group, the term medial has been given to it, and super-medial to the one next above, and sub-medial to the one next below. The superior and inferior are applied to the highest and loAvest series. The terms Primary, Secondary and Tertiary are, in general, applicable to all known countries, but it does not follow that they are necessarily parts of the same formation, extending to different countries : as independent formations are numer ous and extensive, and occasionally some may be wanting. Thus in many parts of our oavh country, the older secondary (by the pupils of Werner call ed Transitions is not to be found ; and even on the borders of the Alleganies, can scarcely be defined. \u2014 Moreover, we are not prepared to allow in full extent the existence of universal formations. If we once admit that idea, we must acknowledge the trap of the Pallisades on the Hudson is the same as that of Edinburgh \u2014 and the coal of Le high and Providence a part of the bed of New Castle or of Ne\\v Holland."], [76, "66 The Primary or Primitive Rocks are those hav ing more or less, a crystalline texture : they contain no orsranic remains \u2014 and form the extremes of all series\u2014 that is to say, they are the highest as well as the lowest rocks. They are the lowest as all others rest upon them\u2014 and are the highest, be cause being highly inclined, and sometimes almost vertical, they rise to day at the summit of the loftiest mountains. Granite, Gneiss and Mica Slate are the most prominent of the primary class \u2014 though they by no means constitute the class as Avas formerly supposed. The Allegany Mountains constitute the primi tive range of the United States. The Secondary Rocks are those lying on the Primary, usually on their declevities or at their feet. Their texture is very seldom crystalline ; but more or less granular, being in a majority of cases, composed of the fragments of the older rocks, united by some cement. \u2022 They contain or ganic remains : Their elevation is not so great as those of the preceding class. Sandstones, Limestones and Slates are the chief members ofthis class. The greater part of our Western Country is of these formations. The great basin of the Mississippi may be termed Secondary."], [77, "67 The Tertiary Class are those of more recent origin and are all placed above the chalk. It is but a few years that these beds have been studied \u2014 but they are extremely interesting \u2014 their tex ure is earthy more or less \u2014 their position nearly horizontal. \u2014 Their organic remains are many and beautiful. Until lately this class has been con founded with Alluvial. Our sea-board from Martha's Vineyard, including great part of Long Island and New-Jersey \u2014 indeed all that country betAveen the Allegany Mountains and the Ocean is Tertiary. Alluvial beds are mostly local \u2014 and are de posits of comparatively very recent formation \u2014 in deed these deposits are constantly going on, and form one of the great changes now operating on our planet. They are composed of finer particles mostly, though not always, that are carried for- Avard by water, and deposited mechanically \u2014 nev er perhaps by chemical precipitation. They are usually on plains, at the mouths of rivers, or at the margin of mountainous ridges. They consist usu ally of sand, clay, loam and gravel \u2014 and proceed mostly from the disintegration of rocks, by the ac tion of running water, or of the atmosphere. \u2014 When carried forward by rivers, and deposited"], [78, "68 at their mouths, they form sub-marine beds and islands, and eventual! . often fill up lakes and har bours. The sea casts up large quantities of sand, &c. increases its shore, and is gradually forced to retire before its own offspring. Girgenti, the an cient Agrigentum, in Sicily, Avas formerly a seaport of great consequence. When I visited these mag nificent ruins, in 1819, they were more than four miles from the beach. The extent and depth of these deposits vary, and will be spoken of more at large when treating of formations in detail. I may remark, however, that when connected with mountains and large rivers, they often con tain grains of metal, as gold, tin and iron, in such quantities as to render them worth exploring. Thus a shaft was sunk in the harbour of Falmouth, (Eng.) 50 feet through alluvial which originated in granite, and a thick bed of from 2 to 10 feet, found at the bottom, composed of round masses of tin, which produced \u00a35U,000 stg. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth the allu vial near the Lead Hills of Scotland was Avashed for the purpose of finding grains of the precious metals, and 300 men were employed. The pro duce is stated to have been \u00a3100,000 stg."], [79, "69 We are not to infer from this, hoAvever, that the gold found in the sands of certain rivers has been always detached from rocks by the action of water : since the auriferous sand is frequently con fined to a small district of the river \u2014 nor is it al ways found near to the mountains\u2014 nor is it al ways in level countries : The Rhine furnishes less gold at Basle than at Strasburg, much farther front the mountains whence it proceeds : and the river Tessino deposits no auriferous sand until it has passed the Lago Maggiore. The alluvial sands of the Danube, the Rhine, the Rhone, Tagus and other European rivers af ford gold \u2014 as do the alluvial of many of the rivers of Asia. The alluvial valleys or plains of Africa have long been famed for their gold dust. Our own continent is rich in golden alluvium \u2014 the gold of Mexico is found chiefly in this soil. On the coast of California are 14 leagues covered with alluvial soil, containing lumps of gold. The gold of North Carolina is also found in alluvial soil. The largest masses of alluvial gold have not exceeded 30 lbs. The diamond, the sapphire, the ruby and the hyacinth have also been carried down by cur- (0"], [80, "70 rents and found in alluvium. Organic remains are frequent in these deposits. Formerly, as before mentioned, all Deposits were termed Alluvial, including many that are Tertiary. But we must distinguish from these deposits, the Diluvial, a name given to those deposits which have been made by an inundation that seems to have covered all rocks, and to have deposited their debris indiscriminately, forming the last great geological change, which the surface of our Earth appears to have undergone. The rocks included in these classes obey cer tain laws in their order of arrangement ; and are then said to have a conformable position as seen in the figure, page 62. Occasionally however some rocks do not obey these laws \u2014 and we find them lying on others to which they bear no relation \u2014 thus we find basalt sometimes resting on sandstone, as at the Palli sades on the Hudson \u2014 which are then said to have an unconformable position \u2014 thus"], [81, "71 In the secondary rocks we often find pebbles, or fragments of the older rocks, consolidated into a mass by means of some cement. These are term ed conglomerates or pudding stones, when the pebbles are rounded by attrition, or breccias when they are fractured and angular. In these conglomerates we usually notice peb bles that are broken, and have their fragments near t-> them : but as such stones could not have been broken without violent force, their position clearly indicates that they have been subjected to such violence in or near the spot where we now observe them : Some of these broken stones do not seem to their parts near to them \u2014 thus indica ting that whatever may have broken them, they have been brought here from some other spot, or else their other parts have been carried to some other place. Some of these retain their angles so sharp as to convince us that they never could have been much tossed about \u2014 while others show us their angles and inequalities rounded off by friction in their motions. The inference is, that, the rocks whence these fragments were torn must have been solid. and exposed to violence before the beds were formed in which these fragments are found. \u2014 When such beds are not horizontal (or nearly so)"], [82, "72 we may conclude that they are not in the position in which they were formed \u2014 but have been elevated. or depressed, by some convulsion posterior to their formation. I have mentioned that organic remains have been found in some rocks, and not in others. As in the course of our duties this subject will often be brought to mind, I must be allowed to enlarge up on it here, in preference to calling off your atten tion from the rocks, which we shall describe as containing these remains of former continents and oceans. When I say that certain shells are peculiar to certain beds, and that when in France or Ameri ca we find certain shells, and know them at once to characterise certain formations of England or Germany, I do not intend to assert the universal identity of Geological formations ; but to notice the remarkable uniformity of fossil conchology in cer tain beds. The identity of mass and of fossils was, more than 150 years ago, insisted on by Lister : but he never dreamed of identity of mass, and diversity of petrifaction, or of diversity of mass and indentity ot petrifactions ; and yet he observed, that forma tions which were distinct by the geognosy of situ-"], [83, "73 ation and superposition, contained in the most dis tant parts of the world, similar species. Ofthe identity of formations, one ofthe strong est proof is derived from zoology, which indicates the identity of fossils in certain beds. The study of these remains is a small, but very interesting and valuable portion of the duties of the philosophical enquirer. To distinguish the geographical limits of extinct animals and plants \u2014 to recognise the genera and species to which they may be referred \u2014 to ascer tain their relations to each other \u2014 and to the clas ses, orders, and families of organised beings ; \u2014 their numbers, as relative to the rocks in which they are found ; \u2014 the progressive developement of animal nature ; \u2014 to arrange species of different continents, and classify them according to zones, climates and hemispheres ; \u2014 to point out the dif ferences of fresh water and marine, of fluviatile and pelagic shells ; \u2014 to note the identical species ac cruing in the same formation in different parts of the globe, and allow them their due weight in the determination of formations, belong to the study of Geological Zoology \u2014 a branch well deserving the attention ofthe philosopher. Properly to appreciate this knowledge, it is on ly necessary in our researches into nature, to en-"], [84, "74 deavour to distinguish strata which bear a resem blance to each other, by aid of their fossil contents. In a bed of Grignon (in France) there have been found 8 species of patella and tellina \u2014 10 of ve nericardia and turritella ; 12 of mellania and am pullaria ; 15 of mitra, bulimus and cytherea ; 18 of ostrea and murex, 25 of plurostoma, 33 of fu sus, 60 of cerithium, and in fine, upwards of 500 different species of bivalves, besides many uni valves, &c. &c. \u2022 Saussure asserts* that at Monte Bolca there are found 105 different species of fossil fish, 39of which are said to come from the Adriatic sea, 3 from the African, 1 8 from those of South, and 1 1 from those of North America. Dolomieu states,! as does Playfair,J that in every coal mine, the fern of America is blended with the palm of Africa, and the bamboo of Asia. The clay at the Isle of Sheppey, abounding in sea shells, is reported to yield upwards of 700 va rieties of fossil fruit. *& 1335. TJourn. de Phys. vol. 39."], [85, "75 Fresh water shells are mixed with marine shells in several places, as near London. The alternations of fresh and salt water pro ductions in the Isle of Wight, and in the Basin of Paris are well known. At Mont Matre the gypsum exhibits animals of land, air and water.* The middle beds of that rock contain fresh water shells, the upper and lower marine shells.f At Monte Bolca, impressions of fish occur with land plants; and at Monte Pulgnasco, the bones of the elephant and rhinosceros are mingled with those of cetaceous animals.J Thus we see that a formation may contain, in different strata, petrifactions specifically different, but that some of the lowest stratum may be min gled with the great mass of species which occur in the superimposed strata. When these are not only specifically, but generically distinct, some being fresh water, others pelagic, it has been thought difficult to solve the unity of the forma tion. *Journ. de Phys. vol. 77, p. 362. tid. vol. 77, p. 365. JId. vol. 39, p. 339\u2014 Vol. 66, p 105\u2014 Vol. 69, p. 81\u2014 Vol HO. p. 50."], [86, "76 A large mass of marine shells may contain some fluviatile shells, or they may alternate in beds. Brongniart* and Beudantf mention the experi ments made by the latter to prove how many flu viatile molu .ca can accustom themselves to live in the ocean. Certain species of palludin\u00e6 prefer brackish waters, and are associated sometimes with pelagic, sometimes with fluviatile shells.\u2014 Humboldt has seen crocodiles on the coast of Ter ra Firma advance far into the sea. J Relative to the distribution of organic remains, a fact has been advanced to prove that there are alternate beds of marie and gypsum, between two marine formations, containing fresh water and land productions in the centre, and marine pro ductions above and below. This is the case (as mentioned before) with the gypsum at Mont Matre. These alternations and intermixtures in the basins of Paris and the Isle of Wight, have been attributed to alternate encroachments and retreats of the sea, and the occasional existence of fresh water lakes. The variety of species among the petrifactions, and the alternations of beds, are, * Geogr. Min. pp. 57, 54,89. t Jour, de Phys. vol. 88, p. 137, 211. lEq. Reg. vol. 1, p. 535 and vol. 2, p. 606"], [87, "77 by some, supposed to be not sufficient to sanction the idea that each bed is of a different formation, or that the beds are confused, and without Geo logical position. It should \"be observed, however, that even Messrs. Cuvier and Brongniart assign to the same formation some marine and fresh water marles and gypsums. Indeed they illustrate the term Formation by this very alternation of beds. A difference having been noticed between fossil and the existing Crustacea and other animals, na turalists were induced to examine more minutely into specific characters ; and the result has been a conviction that organic remains have been de posited in successive generations, and in such or der, that those of one bed bear a certain connect ion to each other, and exhibit peculiar distinctive points from those of earlier or of later deposit : and that the greater the distance between the differ ent deposits, the greater the difference between the contained fossils. This deduction, combatted at first by the most learned, and ridiculed by the novi homines of science, has been found in strict conformity with the phenomena exhibited by ani mal or vegitable fossil remains in different parts of the world. The idea is now prevalent in Europe, and upheld by the most learned and celebrated Naturalists, that the successive generations of or- 1."], [88, "78 ganised bodies that have dwelt on crust of our globe, differ from the present generations, in pro portion as their remains are farther from the Earth's surface ; or, in other words, in proportion as the time in which they existed is more remote from the present day. These successive generations are discovered only in the strata forming the crust of our globe. which was composed by different operations; eacli possessing distinctive characters, drawn from the nature, order and structure of the rocks, and ac- companying minerals. To distinguish the periods at which these different deposits have been made. is one part of Geology \u2014 and this is best and most accurately done, according to M. Brongniart, by the study of organised bodies. Even should the characters taken from the nature of the rocks, from the height of the deposit, from the scooping of vallies, the inclination of beds, and their strata- tication, be at variance with that derived from or- ganic remains, he still considers the latter as ol superior validity. He illustrates his opinion by a notice of Calabria, which for 40 years has suffered the most dreadful disturbances from earthquakes: horizontal beds have become vertical : entire de- posits have been transported to a distance, and have been placed unconformably (or hap hazzard^"], [89, "79 upon other deposits \u25a0 and yet these masses and de posits are never referred to different Geological periods. He fully acknowledges the force of char acters drawn from the rocks themselves, but avows a preference for those drawn from the fossils they contain. The labours of Mons. Brongniart, in addition to his advancement ofthe study of subterranean con chology, have served to prove the identity of some formations in Europe with some of our own coun try : thereby confirming more fully his opinion, that each formation has, so to speak, its own Flora or Fauna, modified by time and space. Zoology is thus made to render a service very important to its sister Science, by the determina tion of relations between the formations and their fossil contents. Not only in comparing neighbour ing strata, but in ascertaining those of foreign and and distant countries, Zoology and Botany are themselves elevated above the mere inspection and comparison of distinctive characters, and now in vestigate the whole of vegitable and animal organ ization. The degree of analogy or similarity between fos sil and existing plants and animals is, by this ex tensive view, made of the utmost importance. though it may be somewhat difficult to draw the"], [90, "80 corresponding marks and characteristics of fossil, with recent or living individuals, species and gen era. This resemblance, it will be seen, leads to deductions important to a complete Theory of the Earth. Much prudence and deep research are to be employed in the application of our attainments in Fossil Zoology and Botany : nor has this escaped the accurate and penetrating mind of the Natural ist who first established the importance of this study : thereby coinciding with the views of the deceased Werner, who never failed, in the course of his lectures, to fix the attention of his pupils on the relations that exist between certain fossils and formations of different ages.* \" I do not deny, says Mons. B. that much atten tion and discretion are necessary to be used in _mch a matter. It is requisite to distinguish and estimate even the influence of horizontal distances and of climates upon the specific differences : we must know to appreciate the apparent, sometimes even the real points of resemblance, which present themselves, in formations which are evidently very distinct, in certain species which have had the rare privilege of surviving the destruction of their *Essa. sur le Gisementdes roche?."], [91, "81 contemporaries, and of remaining always the same, in the midst of all the changes which have taken place around them. It is necessary to know. and to recognise, the individuals wrested from other deposits and transported, (by whatever cau ses) to new ones : and to distinguish them from those which have lived in the places and times which the species to which they belong ought to characterise. All these difficulties are to be ac knowledged ; and we must be on our guard against those causes of deception which introduce uncer tainties in Geology, such as we meet in other sci ences \u2014 and which impose upon the Geologist un remitting attention and labour, to employ with dis cernment the fossil and recent species whence he takes his characters, and to attach to them the true value that belongs to them in Geological re searches. In speaking of the Earth's surface, we usually divide it into Dry Land \u2014 and Bottom ofthe Sea. Of the Bottom of the Sea \u2014 It was formerly sup posed that fossil coal and other bituminous sub stances existed there in such quantity as to cause the bitterness of its waters \u2014 and Count Marsigli made many experiments to ascertain the truth of"], [92, "82 the supposition. No experiments, however, with our present means, can be sufficiently accurate to determine this question. Since the true bottom may be, and we know often is covered by fortuitous mix tures of various substances, so as to prevent a plum met from bringing up correct proofs of its nature. Veins of bitumen and salt doubtless continue the same, and in the same order under the sea, that we find them on the land ; and the same strata of rocks which support hills, &_c. on shore, no doubt serve in the same way to support the immense mass of Ocean water. It is probable too, that the metallic and other veins existing in the Earth, run in the same manner at the bottom ofthe Sea. The loose particles perhaps carried off to deep water, and there deposited \u2014 but some of the veins may be exposed, and probably yield that beautiful me tallic lustre, which we so frequently find on sub stances drawn from the depths of Ocean. Subterranean rivers, it is probable, make great changes in the bottom of the sea. We know of the existence of subterranean currents, and the effects they sometimes produce on the surface ofthe globe, such as the falling in of large portions of ground\u2014 and the undermining of mountains. In the same way we know of the existence of submarine cur rents, which may, or may not be occasioned by the"], [93, "83 breaking out of rivers at the bottom ofthe sea, and thus tend at the same time to alter the natural sur face at the bottom. In clear water, near the shore, we often see these currents, and can draw up the fresh water. It is a pretty universal rule among those of our brethren, whose \" home is on the mountain wave,\" the sailors, that in proportion as shores are rocky, high, and steep, so is the depth of water below them: and that low, level shores indicate shallow water. It is generally acknowledged that the deepest part of the Mediterranean is under the height of Malta \u2014 and we know that in approach ing Long Island, the water is shallow. A know ledge of the strata on shore, in this way, may teach us tho materials forming the bottom, as it stretches under water for some considerable dis- tance. It may justly be supposed that the inequalities under water are the same as those above. Capt. Cook in the Pacific, tried sounding, unsuccessfully. with 250 fathoms of line. Capt. Scoresby tried ! 200 fathoms in the Arctic seas, without finding bottom. Besides a direct knowledge of the depth of water by the use of the plumb-line \u2014 and the inference drawn from the appearance ofthe shore. \u25a0vp have another criterion \u2014 I mean the thermome-"], [94, "84 ter, to tell us when we have shoal water. This instrument shows a diminution of temperature in the water as we approach land. I dwell particu larly on this fact, as it is owing to a want of know ledge of these particulars, that two fine packets in the Liverpool line have been lost within a few miles of our city, within the last eight months. Losses that may justly be attributable to igno rance \u2014 I do not say carelessness \u2014 so sure an in dicator is the thermometer, in the water, of the approach of land, particularly on the East coast of the United States. I may refer for particulars to an Essay on the Natural History of the Ocean, published by Professor Silliman, in the 5th vol. of his American Journal of Science. The coral fisheries give us occasion to discover the existence of many large submarine caverns, which, from the action of the water, are more liable to become large and empty, by the solution of mud &c, than caverns are on dry land. From all these circumstances, in conjunction with others which it would be needless to enume rate, we have reason to conclude, that the bottom of the sea is composed of and covered by the same substances as the surface of dry land, viz. rocks, clay, sand, &c. It is in most, perhaps in all places covered with an accidental coat. In deep"], [95, "85 water, where the surface only is agitated, the bot tom is never disturbed: from such places, the plummet brings up pure white sand, or a mixture of triturated shells \u2014 or a powder formed of the fragments of coral, or parts of rocks. The bed of ocean too has its appropriate shrubs, plants, and flowers ; and no doubt the geographical distribution of submarine plants is as nicely and strictly defined as that of Alpine or other plants \u2014 and many of them are extremely beautiful. From the depths of the sea we often draw up substances of the most brilliant colours \u2014 scarlet, vermillion, purple, blue, green, and snowy white : not superficial and transient, but in most cases real and permanent. Some marine substances, as coral, &c, do, however, exhibit on being first drawn from the water, the most superb and brilliant co lours, which are evanescent, and fade in a moment. The small quantities we find on marine bodies, as we approach deep water, may give us some idea of what we might find in the deep and unfathom able recesses. \" Full many a gem of purest ray serene, The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear.\" 12"], [96, "86 A poet has beautifully described a submarine scene. It was a Garden beyond all priee, Even yet it was a place of paradise , Por where the mighty ocean could not spare, There had he, with his own creation, Sought to repair his work of devastation. And here were coral bowers, And grots of madrepores, And banks of sponge, as soft and fair to eye As e'er was mossy bed. Here, too, were living flowers, Which, like a bud compacted, Their purple cups contracted, And now in open blossoms spread, Stretched like green anthers many a seeking head. And arborets of jointed stone were there, And plants of fibres fine, as silkworm's thread : Yea, beautiful as mermaid's golden hair, Upon the waves dispread : Others, that like the broad banana growing, Raised their long wrinkled leaves of purple hue, Like streamers wide outflowing. And whatsoe'er the depths of ocean hide From human eyes, Ladurlad there espied, Trees of the deep, and shrubs and fruits and flowers, As fair as ours.

By Lowland is meant an extensive country, flat, or of inconsiderable elevation above the sea \u2014 compo sed mostly of plains, and hilly as it approaches the Alpine district. The few elevations that occur in it are small, and chiefly in the central part. We have one immense tract of Lowland, tra versed by the Mississippi and Missouri, bordering east on the Appalachian, and west on the Rocky Mountains. In South America there is also one extensive district of low land, bordering on the Andes. The principal Lowland of Europe comprises the Eastern portion of Britain and the northern part of France, the Netherlands the north of Ger many and Silesia, all Poland, and the north west part of the Rusian Empire. The central portion of Asia consists of one great Lowland Tract, called the Steppes. The extent ofthis division of surface in Africa has never been ascertained. Alpine land is composed of groups of mountains, which are again formed of mountain chains, or a series of single mountains. Mountain groups are usually highest in the mid dle, and in an Alpine country each takes a differ-"], [98, "88 ent direction, being separated by plains and val lies, or by hilly districts. Each group forms a whole, both as to base and acclivity, partially in tersected in many places, but never to the base, except at the termination of the chain. Mountainous land is composed of single moun tains collected into chains, which, however, not being united by an Alpine or central chain, never form groups. The rounded, undulating elevations of hilly dis tricts are much lower than the preceding, and form a gradual transition to Lowland. The summit of a mountain chain is called its ridge, and the concavities in a mountain group, which usually run parallel to its longest direction, vallies. High mountain groups are those of an elevation of 7000 feet and upwards \u2014 as the Andes, Alps, Pyrennees, &c. Mountains of middle height, are trom 4 to 6000 feet high. Low groups are from 700 to 3000 feet in height. Generally the length ofa Mountain Group is in proportion to its height, and to the breadth of its base. If the breadth and length are nearly the same, it is called Massive. If the length is consider able in proportion to its base, we say it is a long Mountain Group. Another distinction is derived"], [99, "89 from the form and the connection of mountains composing the group, as the Common, the Alpine, and the Conic Mountain Groups. With regard to the diffi rent parts of a Mountain, we recognise the foot, acclivity and summit. The foot is usually flat, and more or less extensive. \u2014 The acclivity is usually considered as the steepest part of the mountain, and is often almost a perpen dicular precipice. The more gradual and gentle the ascent ofa moutain, the more rich does it gen erally prove in ores. The summit varies in steepness and shape ; and the latter is indicative of the nature of the rock of which it is composed. Thus Granite and the Pri mary Rocks usually have sharp peaks. The elder Secondary (or Transition) are rounded : Clay and Basalt present short and obtuse conical summits. Though Mountains are styled \" La Charpente et l'Ossature du Globe Terrestre,\"' yet the highest are but mere specks in proportion to the diameter of the Earth. Thus Mount Blanc the highest in Europe, is on the surface of our planet, what a single line would be on a globe of 21 feet diameter. In speaking of Mountains, I must be allowed to notice a Theory accounting for their origin which has lately been proposed by a Mons. Chabrier in"], [100, "90 a Dissertation, not long since published, on the General Deluge. Having observed the immense blocks of Granite scatterred over the North of Ger- many, and not being able to trace them satisfac- torily (for himself) to the Mountains of Sweden or the Hartz \u2014 he wisely has concluded them to be Aerolites. \u2014 Having proved this to hi. own satisfac- tion \u2014 and having ascertained that mountains are only heaps of rubbish, he doubted if granite and the primary rocks were ever deposited from a sea which nobody had ever seen \u2014 and from other sim- ilar arguments, he asserts, that granite came, as it now exists, from the atmosphere, with the accom- panying substances. This terrible shower of mountains arising from the fragments of a planetary body violently struck by a comet, rained at once upon the nucleus of ours (which gives him no con- concern) the Alps, Pyrenees and Andes and the Allegany and Rocky Mountains. The substances in falling crushed the tufted forest and produced coal by compression. The destroyed planet was that which had for its satellites the four little moons, Ceres, Pallas, Vesta and Juno, which even now irrefragibly prove the former existence of that un fortunate planet. But even this monstrous shower of mountains does not satisfy the gentleman. It was accompa-"], [101, "91 \"nied by all the waters of the planet, which falling in torrents submerged the Earth, and deluged the inhabitants : but the rain of waters preceded the rain of solids and mountains, which last came very opportunely to confine the waters, in part, and form our continents. The fossil remains of trees* offish, an'' the skeleton of a man found at Guada loupe, art -he remains of the vegitable and animal kingdom of the unhappy planet. Mons. Chabrier supposes too that some ofthe in habitants of the unfortunate planet escaped the general wreck, and survived the fall, notwithstand ing all this hard usage \u2014 and he thus accounts for the difference of races as observed by naturalists. Thus the Negroes and Malays are probably the decendauts ofthe inhabitants ofthe other world \u2014 which at one and the same time charitably furnish ed us with mountains and negroes. It seldom happens that all sides of a mountain have the same acclivity, which fact has given rise to various theories This difference was long ago observed, but it was a Swedish Naturalist who first noticed that it was so prevalent as to form a law- His observation, however, related to the extreme end only, and not to the flanks of mountains. He"], [102, "92 stated that the steepest acclivity always faced that part of the country where the land laid highest. Bergman observed,* that the different declivi ties of the flanks oi mountains bear an invariable relation to their different aspects. He laid it down as a rule, that mountains running from north to south had always the west flank the steepest : and that those running east and west had always the south side the steepest. \u2014 Thus, he said, the Alps are steeper on the west and south than on the north and east, and the Cordilleras are steepest on the west. Buffon also noticed this fact \u2014 as did Hermann, who brought as evidence the Swedish and Nor wegian Mountains, the Alps, the Caucassian, the Appenines and the Ouralians. The Carpathian Mountains, those of Norway those on the coast of Scotland, the Welsh Moun tains, those separating Saxony from Bohemia, the Hartz, the Pyrennees, and those of Crim Tartary. in Europe : The Mountains of India and of Syria, and the Cordilleras are testimonies to the truth oi the observation. I may here say that Pallas and Forster account for the unequal declevities of the north and south *Physic. Descript. ofthe Earth"], [103, "93 sides by the supposition of a great flood from the south, giving the Earth its present form. The celebrated Kirwan accounted for all these inequalities by supposing a two fold violent motion of the water, by which the globe was covered : the one from north to south, the other from east to west. This last being intercepted by such mountains as run north and south, the impulse of the water was checked, and the Earthy particles held in solution by the water, were deposited on the eastern side. which thus became more gentle and moderate : while the west side could receive no such acces sion, and of course remained rugged and steep. \u2014 The northern current acted in a similar way, on the north side of such mountains as running east and west, intercepted its course. It is worthy of observation, that all considerable chains of mountains run in a direction north east and south west. Our Alleganies are one proof of this remark. Vallies, dividing Mountains and furrowing the surface, deserve the attention of the Geologist, as connected with those events that have contributed to produce the present state of our planet. We find them commencing at great elevations, and in their course uniting in the most efficient manner to collect and carry off the water and 13"], [104, "94 moisture into some large stream, on its way to the Ocean. They present such appearances as would naturally arise from water forming channels for it self in retiring from land. On a very small scale, this is daily repeated on muddy and sandy shores, when the tide is out. The present inequalities of hill and vale, afford strong reason for the supposi tion that it was water that produced them. We are not however to overlook the effect produced by the violent convulsions that seem to have ele vated and depressed strata, in so many cases. In mountainous countries particularly, vallies seem to have owed their first outline to the disruptive for ces in action around them. Instead of gentle slopes we find deep hollows, with almost perpendicular precipices, forming the receptacles of mountain lakes. Yet even these vallies have been greatly modified by water. In low countries, where no disturbance of the surface or strata exists, we must refer vallies entirely to the effects of running water. The streams however that now flow through vallies do not seem to have ever had sufficient power to form the channels in which we now find them. An eternity almost would be necessary in many cases for the present rivers to produce the vallies through which they now roll \u2014 and even then there would be physical impossibilities. What"], [105, "95 an eternity, for instance, would be necessary for running water to produce the mountain passage of the Highlands, and wear down the solid strata of rock from the very summit of tne Dunderberg to the present channel in which our own noble Hudson winds its way ! Vallies, running in the course of the mountain chains that bound them, are called Longitudinal vallies, and those dividing the mountains from each other, and cutting the mountain chain across, are named Transverse Vallies. It will not be denied that vallies have been form ed after the consolidation of the strata through which they run ; \u2014 for we find the same strata of rocks on either side and in the same order. This is the case in almost every valley \u2014 and it will be seen that they very generally cut the strata across. In a few cases, however, vallies do occur be tween different strata, running longitudinally with"], [106, "96 them ; and then the different sides of the vallies are of course of different materials. The cause that produced vallies has, in many places, carried off the strata that once covered masses of rock which we now find bare or insula ted hills : this disrobing of the rock has been termed Denudation. *It is well known that not only Argillite, but every member of the primary class has been occasionally found in contact with Granite."], [107, "LECTURE III.

Independent of the changes that are now con stantly going on by the partial agency of water, we have other causes acting more powerfully in alter ing the present configuration of the Earth's sur face. Of these I shall briefly notice but three \u2014 viz. : I. The formation of Peat ,Bogs, and Mosses. II. The formation of Coral Reefs \u2014 and III. Internal Heat, as manifested by Volcanoes and Earthquakes. The change produced by the formation of Peat is partial and trivial compared with the others. Mountain and Marsh Peat are formed in the places whence their name is derived, by the de-"], [108, "98 composition of plants. In the shallow parts of lakes are found numerous subaquatic plants, which in summer flower at the surface and then sink to the bottom. By the annual death of a portion of these a stratum of peat is formed at the bottom. where this process is constantly going on. The death of fresh water shell fish, and the deposits of earth and sand brought into the lake by streams, assist in raising the bottom of the lake, and thus prepare it for other plants ; in like manner to thrive, blossom and die. In other cases no distinct bed of peat is produ ced from the subaquatic plants \u2014 but a stratum is formed by the decay of land plants, which gradual ly extends into the lake and finally occupies its bed. The shells, which for centuries have been deposited at the bottom of the lake thus become covered by peat, and are eventually consolidated into marl beds \u2014 thus offering one of the most use ful auxiliaries to Agriculture. By occasional floods, sand, gravel, clay and earthy particles are thrown over these thin strata of peat, and destroy vegitation. By many and al ternate similar causes, a series of beds of peat and of soil is produced, which eventually, exhausting the lake, becomes a fertile field, instead of forming a peat or moss meadow."], [109, "99 Different kinds of peat have their peculiar plants entering into their formation. Mountain Peat is formed principally by the fol- lowing, viz. : Erica cinerea, Polytrichum commune, Lycopodium clavatum, Lichen rangiferinus, Nardus stnctus, Scirpus c\u00e6spitosus, Juncus squarrosus, Many grasses of the genera, Aira, agrostis, and carex. vulgaris, tetralix, Myrica gale, Empetrum nigrum, Tormentilla erecta, Arbutus uva ursi, Vaccinium vitis idaea, Juniperus communis, In the formation of Marsh Peat, the Sphagnum t, assisted materially palustre is the chief ingredient, however by the following, viz. : Erica vulgaris, tetralix, Myrica gale, Vaccinium oxycoccos, Eryophorum polystachium, vaginatum, Sch\u0153nus albus, and others of this genus, Scirpus c\u00e6spitosus, and oth- ers of this genus, Pedicularis palustris, sylvatica, Orchis maculata, conopsea, Aira aquatica, c\u00e6spitosa, Festuca fluitans, Caltha palustris, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Lysimachia tenella, Menyanthes tnfoliata, Ranunculus flammula, Comarum palustre, Narthecium ossifragum, Pinguicula vulgaris, Drosera longifolia, anglica, rotundifolia.

Bogs and Mosses are also accumulations of veg itable matter in wet ground \u2014 settling in successive generations on itself, until its bulk rises considera bly above the level of its bed. \u2014 The surface of a bog is always undulated, and terminates abruptly, sometimes almost perpendicularly. The average height of the great Irish bogs is about 250 feet above high water mark in Dublin harbour. Quaking bogs are produced in wet, flat grounds, where springs abound. Weeds, shrubs, and trees, by their decay and fall, assist in darning up the stream, and the water becoming stagnant, the whole flat is overflowed. A coarse grass, which is peculiar to these bogs, springs up in tufts : the roots become closely interwoven, and in a few seasons they grow"], [111, "101 to a considerable height. The decay of these plants in winter, furnishes soil for the reception and germination of the seeds The tops of flags and grass occasionally become intermixed and consoli dated on the surface of the water, and increasing in thickness and extent, cover the superficies. \u2014 This receives seeds, which grow and cover it with vegitation, and becomes so strong as to bear a man, but still in some places trembles, or quakes, whence the name is derived. The formation of coral reefs is daily producing a change, more or less, on that part of our globe at present covered by water, but more particular ly in the Pacific Ocean. They are the production of the combined labours of millions of marine zoophytes, usually termed the connecting link be tween the animal and vegitable kingdoms, but per haps more justly considered as that link between the animal and mineral kingdoms. The never ending industry of these minute animals, is sup posed by many naturalists to work changes in our globe far surpassing even those produced by the fearful and powerful agency of subterranean fire by means of Volcanoes and Earthquakes. 14"], [112, "102 The common foundation of all those clusters of Islands discovered in the Pacific, as well as those of New South Wales, is of coral structure ; ex tensive reefs ofwhich run off in all directions. Banks of coral are found at all depths, having no communication with each other\u2014 and at all dis tances from land. By a rapid increase they ar rive at or near the surface, when winds and waves force up loose fragments from deeper water, and, an accumulation thus going forward, islands are seen in all the different stages of progressive for mation \u2014 as shoals first \u2014 then as reefs or breakers \u2014 eventually as bare rock above the water, and finally in their state of perfection- covered with soil, and adorned in all the beauties of vegitation. Kotzebue in his voyage to the Pacific, and Capt- Flinders, in his account of New South Wales, have each given many pages to these interesting produc tions. It seems probable that when these little animals have commenced their labours, and have ceased to live, their structures adhere together \u2014 and the small interstices being filled with sand, a solid rock is soon the consequence. Future races con tinue to erect their habitation on the rising bank, and die in turn, while elevating this monument of their labours. It is by a surprising instinct that in"], [113, "103 the early stages of their labour, they work perpen dicularly ; and as they erect their wall chiefly in situations where the winds are constant, they thus afford a shelter to the leeward, whence their in fant colonies are sent off It is owing to this that the windward side ofa reef of coral is always the highest part, rising sometimes perpendicularly from the depth of 200 feet, or perhaps as many fathoms. It seems necessary to our busy labourers to be covered with water, in order that their work may be uninterrupted, for as soon as the reef has reach- ed such a height as to remain almost dry at low water, at the time of ebb, the corals cease to build higher ; sea-shells, fragments of corals, echin\u00e6 and their broken off prickles become united by the burning sun, through the medium of the cementing calcareous sand which has arisen from the pulveri- zation of the shells, into one whole or solid stone ; and this, strengthened by the continual throwing up of new materials, gradually increases in thick- ness, till at last, it becomes so high as only to be covered by the high tides of particular seasons. \u2014 The solar rays so heat this mass when it is dry, that it splits and breaks off into flakes. These flakes are again thrown upon each other at high tides. The active surf throws blocks of Coral"], [114, "104 (sometimes 6 or 8 feet long and 3 or 4 thick) and shells of marine animals between and upon the foundation stones : after this the calcareous sand lies undisturbed, and offers to the seeds of plants and trees cast upon it by the waves, a soil, upon which they rapidly grow to overshadow its daz zling white surface. Entire trunks of trees, car ried by rivers from other countries and islands, find here, at length, an accidental resting place. With these come some small animals, as lizards and in sects, as the first inhabitants. The sea bird nestles there, and by feathers, &c. contributes to the formation of a soil \u2014 sea plants now take root upon it \u2014 a cocoa nut is cast on shore \u2014 stray land birds find it a refuge \u2014 the seeds of shrubs and trees are thus carried there, and when the work has long been completed, man also appears, build? his hut on the fruitful soil formed by the corrup tion of the leaves of the trees, and styles him self lord and proprietor of this new creation. But of all the changes arising from causes now in actual operation, those resulting from the agen cy of Subterranean Heat, by Volcanoes and Earth quakes, are the most remarkable and interesting. The. time allotted allows me to cast but a cur"], [115, "105 sory glance at a few of the facts in connection with these phenomena, which often in a few minutes change the whole surface of a country. In the earlier periods of our globe, these fires seem to have been more extensively in action than at present ; as is proved by the many remains of extinct volcanoes of great size which we find in various parts of the world, and by the existence of rocks nearly allied to volcanic products in almost every country. Of the structure of these mountains. I shall only say that they are generally truncated cones, with an aperture in the centre, called the Crater, whence the eruptions issue : but not unfrequently they break out at the side or foot of the mountains ; and occasionally under the sea \u2014 and are then termed Submarine Volcanoes, or Eruptions. Most of them are situated near the Ocean, or to Lakes, whence many Geologists have supposed that water forms one of the chief agents in vol canic phenomena. When single, they have a pyramidal or conical form, ascending at a moderate angle of inclina tion from the base to an elevated plain, from the centre of which rises the principal crater. No burning Volcano situated in a chain of moun tains is to be found in Europe or Asia \u2014 they be-"], [116, "106 jng generally at a distance from them. On the American Continent, on the contrary, Volcanoes of the most stupendous size form part of the Cor dilleras. In the south of the province of Quito, in Chili, and in Guatimala, they are grouped in rows. Baron Humboldt \u2014 than whom no man has ever visited a greater number, or drawn more philo sophical deductions, in regard to them, has made the following observations, viz. 1. That Mountains with slender conical peak$ have eruptions of the greatest violence and at the shortest intervals \u2014 as Cotopaxi, Peak of Teneriffe, and Orizava in Mexico. 2. Those with long summits, rugged and rocky, are nearly extinguished \u2014 as Hecla in Iceland, and many in South America. 3. That rounded summits indicate in many pla ces porphyritic lava, that has been heated and raised up, but never burst forth as Chim borazo, and the greater Sarcony in Auvergne. All Volcanic Mountains have the cone, or su gar loaf, as it is appropriately called, covered with scori\u00e6, or cinders and ashes. 1 myself believe that the whole cone is composed of such substances as have been ejected once, at least, those nearest the heat being again consolidated. It has been usual for travellers to state, that from the brim of"], [117, "107 the crater, it was easy to see the boiling lava with in. This good fortune did not attend me, as I found it not only dangerous, but impossible to get within such distance of the crater of Vesuvius, during an eruption, as to allow the angle of vision to be more than 45\u00b0. But even had it been possible to stand on the very rim of the crater, and cast the eye directly downwards, the thick cloud of smoke hanging within, would have concealed the burning mass. The shape of the crater is constantly varying with every new eruption. Its size does not de pend on the elevation or mass of the Volcanic Mountain. Vesuvius is a small hill compared with the Peak of Tenerifle, and it has a crater five times larger. The Volcanoes of the Andes have all small openings, and there are many reasons for believing, that the size of the opening diminishes as the elevation of the mountain is greater, were it not that those of Cotopaxi and Rucipichinca have craters three fourths of a mile in diameter. The depth of a crater varies continually in ac tive volcanoes ; but in those long dormant, it under goes no change excepting that produced by the occasional fall of part of its wall. In this case it allows of actual measurement : thus the crater of the Peak of Teneriffe is 105 feet deep"], [118, "108 The whole cone of a Volcano is sometimes swallowed up during an eruption, leaving a larger circular crater, at a less elevation, which finally becomes dormant, and forms a Lake. Such is the celebrated Lake of Avernus, and that of Agnano, near Naples. Independent of the destructive changes pro duced by the burning lava, and by the scori\u00e6 fal ling in ohowers around the crater whole mountains are sometimes formed at one eruption ; thus Monte Nuovo about 10 miles from Naples was raised in one night ; and Monte Rosso on Etna, with a base of 2 miles in circumference, and a height of 750 feet, is composed ofthe scori\u00e6 that fell after one eruption of 1569. The color of the mass of ma terials of this last mountain is generally reddish, as the name denotes, and the scori\u00e6 contains em beded schorl. In the intendancy of Valladolid, in New Spain, is an immense plain belong to the plantation Jorul lo, 2600 feet above the sea, and cultivated during the last century with cane and indigo, having its elevations crowned with evergreen oaks, and palm trees. After some admonitory warnings, a tract of ground, in this place, to the extent of 10 miles, rose in the shape of a bladder, being about 40 feet at the edges, and 534 feet at the centre"], [119, "109 above its former level. Many mountains soon after rose on different parts of it, the most elevated of which is the Volcano Jorullo. There are other proofs of the reason we have to consider internal heat as an active agent in the production of Geological phenomena : but these will suffice. I have abstained from entering into minuti\u00e6 con cerning any one volcano. Having visited some of the most celebrated in Europe, I may perhaps be indulged, at the risk of an imputation of egotism, in briefly relating a few particulars. In 1819, 1 had the satisfaction of seeing and of visiting Vesuvius during an eruption. The dark ness of the night, the time I had chosen, (for my first visit) rendered the scene more awful and sub lime. In ascending the cone, we traversed beds of lava that but a few days before had been vomited forth : Although the surface was black, the interior was still a heated mass ; and we saw the yet red lava through the small cracks in the surface. On inserting through these fissures the sticks we had in our hands, they were immediately withdrawn on fire. We could not approach within 6 feet of the rim ofthe crater, and even by crawling could not get our faces near the edge, so as to see the bot tom \u2014 or indeed any thing but a mass of cloud ob- 15"], [120, "110 structing the sight. The dreadful bellowing and roaring of the interior was indeed awful, and at in tervals a sudden and tremendous explosion warn ed us of the shower of stones, that ascending in the flames, were to fall red hot around us. These stones were of all sizes, and we endeavored to escape the shower by running down the cone. About 100 feet below the brim of the crater, through a hole in its side, gushed a constant stream of liquid lava. It appeared ofthe consistency of molten iron, and flowed slowly in the channel it had formed for itself. From this liquid mass we contrived, by the aid of poles, to detach small masses, in which we inserted each some small arti cle, while the lava was pliable. Some silver that I had in my pocket, and my watch key, were among the articles thus forced into the liquid lava, which then cooled around them : as you now see them. Having retired about 100 yards from this burn ing river, and thrown aside some of the smaller cin ders so as to form a small excavation on the spot where a current of heated air was escaping, which served to keep us warm, we took our supper, and lighting our torches by the lava, wrote letters to our friends \u2014 and then slept, for an hour, before the glorious orb of day, rejoicing in the east, call ed us to the summit to behold its splendor."], [121, "111 There are 36 eruptions of Vesuvius on record previous to 1 806, since when they have been almost annual.

Monti Gi bello, or Monte Bello, (from Mongibello, Mount of Mounts) as it is called by the inhabitants, has been so often visited and described, that it is needless, nor would it be proper, for me, here, to enter into a detail of its history or its beauties. Relative to its history, it may be observed, that doubts have arisen as to its origin ; which shall be spoken of in another place ; here it is only necessary to observe that Count Borch, and some other Geologists con sider Etna as a Granitic Mountain, containing abundance of lead and copper, merely covered by volcanic products. In proof of which, it is alleged, that on the mountain shells exist at the"], [122, "112 height of 2000 feet above the sea \u2014 and that strata of clay with marine shells are found 2400 feet above the sea, dipping towards it ; and which pro bably had been formed there while the mountain was progressively rising from the ocean. But I consider Etna as an assemblage of mountains, piled on each other, and which have been pro duced by different eruptions from many volcanic openings, most of which are now dormant ; and that the whole mass is thus an accumulation of volcanic products. Monte Nuovo and nearly fifty other mountains on that side of Etna next to Cata nia are formed wholly of ejected substances. \u2014 Many of them are now covered by a fertile soil, though still exhibiting the crater well defined. After leaving the luxuriant and fertile region that skirts the base of the mountain, and forced our mules over the sterile band, near to the regions of eternal snow, we passed this frozen zone on foot, and reached the cone, which we ascended. The lower half was covered with snow. The upper portion, nearly half a mile, was clear to the brim of the crater. From the surface of this brim or edge, which was hot to the feet, arose heated air, strong ly impregnated with sulphur. As this air or gas oozed through the surface it deposited beautiful and brilliant crystals of sulphur. On"], [123, "113 breaking up the crust with our sticks, we saw them glistening, and collected quantities of them : some of which are now on this table. The interior of the crater was covered with snow near the bottom; \u2014 except the northern side, which rose a solid wall, separating it from another crater. From cracks in this wall, and from a few small openings in the bottom, a thin white smoke was gently ascending, and, in small quantity, gracefully curling itself into the atmosphere. We descended some distance into the crater, in pursuit of specimens of the many crystals known to exist among the products of this volcano. It was a mild and lovely evening, when, after having been refreshed at St. Nicoloso, we continued our way to the summit, so as to be there by sun rise. 1 only mention this to add that during our ascent, we found it extremely cold before we reached the frozen region \u2014 and that we beheld at the same time a thunder storm some distance at sea. On leaving the summit for our descent, we experi enced all the vicissitudes of climate, extreme cold, a snow storm, and several violent showers of rain, with alternate intervals of a scorching and brilliant sunshine. We are all aware of the distance often run by the lava from this volcano. Catania, nearly 40"], [124, "114 miles from its summit, has often been destroyed by it. Taormina, about the same distance on another side of the mountain, has often suffered the same fate. In its vicinity is found a beautiful red lava. The base of Etna covers a circumference of about 36 miles ; and on its sides are not fewer than 80 cities, towns, and villages, and allowing from 1200 to 1500 persons to each, it may be safe ly stated that there are 100,000 people inhabiting voluntarily the crust ofthis immense volcano. One of the latest submarine volcanoes of which we have an account, was that, which, in 1811, burst forth in the Azores, near St. Michaels. Immense clouds of black smoke were observed to rise from the surface of the sea, when, suddenly a column of cinders, ashes, and stones shot up with great violence, accompanied by a grumbling noise and vivid flashes of lightning. The depth of water at the spot was formerly 180 feet. The quantity of ashes and scori\u00e6 was so great that on the fourth day the accumulation was seen to rise above the water, forming the rim of the crater, which thus was reared among the waves."], [125, "115 The island of Sabrina, thus formed, rose about 250 feet from the sea, with a circumference of about a mile, at the waters edge. A similar island arose many years since, near to Tercira, of the same group, in a single night. The islands that have been produced by sub marine volcanoes in the Grecian Archipelago, are among the most remarkable products of these phenomena. We all know that volcanoes eject many sub stances beside lava \u2014 and that cinders and ashes are sometimes projected to a great distance. The celebrated Pompeia, which has so often been de scribed by other persons who have visited the in teresting ruins, was covered by ashes showered upon it from Vesuvius, (from which it is distant about 12 miles) in the year 79 ofthe Christian era. Intimately connected with the preceding phe nomena, both as to cause and effect, is that dread ful convulsion of nature, for which no word in any language has yet been found to convey an idea sufficiently appalling. No word can impress upon the mind the terror it occasions. The extensive, immediate, and awful consequences of the earth quake, leave no hope, no refuge for the alarmed individual \u2014 no refuge but the refuge of despair."], [126, "116 There is no country that is not more or less affected by them : even the sea is subject to them. The annals of the world mark no week, per haps no day, that is not a record of their devastation \u2014 No accurate account of the cause of earth quakes has been handed to us by preceeding philosophers. All their investigations ended in supposition, instead of collection, comparison, and reflection. One of the earliest earthquakes on record since the Christian era, was that which, under Tiberius, destroyed in one night 12 cities in Asia Minor, in a circumference of about 300 miles in diameter. It is remarkable that no other changes took place \u2014 no springs or fountains were dried up, the course of no river altered \u2014 no hill overthrown \u2014 but all remains the same at the present day. The history ofthe violent earthquakes that in the sixty third and succeeding years of our era, preced ed those eruptions of Vesuvius, which destroyed Herculaneum and Pompeia, and in which the el der Pliny lost his life, is familiar to most of us. During that fearful one which preceded the erup tion of Vesuvius on Sept. 28, 1538, the Lucrine lake near Naples was lost \u2014 a whole town and all its inhabitants swallowed \u2014 a tract of ground near Lake Avernus rose up, and in one night Monte"], [127, "117 Nuovo (formerly mentioned) arose, and next morn ing showed an elevation of 1127 feet above the level ofthe sea. The whole country was destroy ed, and in 24 hours not even the vestige of a habi tation was to be discerned. The famous Earthquake of 1755 that destroyed Lisbon, and that which in 1783 convulsed Calabria, are the most important on modern records. A mere outline of either would occupy an hour. Of the violence of the former we may form some idea, when we know that it was severely felt over all Spain \u2014 (except Catalonia, Arragon, and Valencia) \u2014 that in Africa it was almost as severe as in Eu rope \u2014 that it was felt in England, Scotland, Nor way, Sweden, Germany, Holland, Switzerland and Corsica \u2014 even in Antigua and Barbadoes \u2014 nay, even on the shores of Lake Ontario. At Lisbon it began 25 minutes past 9 in the morning. Be tween 9 and 1 0 the master of a vessel bound to the West Indies, being then in north lat. 25, and west long. 40, and many miles from land, heard a vio lent noise, and perceived his ship agitated as if by a sudden jerk \u2014 He started in great terror, and perceived through the cabin window land at the distance of about a mile, which, when he got on deck, had disappeared. In another minute three rocky pinnacles rose from the sea and spouted wa- 17"], [128, "118 ter, and a heavy dense cloud, which ascended, and left nO trace of the rocks. Another vessel, be tween 9 and 10 the same morning, about 40 leagues from St. Vincent, was violently jerked, as if she had struck a rock, and all hands on board were thrown down. The sea was agitated for a minute, and then no trace of rock or storm ap peared. The Earthquakes of Calabria were equally aw ful. Kircher, who witnessed one in 1 638, publish ed a long and interesting account of it. Sir Wil liam Hamilton has given a valuable and accurate statement of the convulsions of this unhappy coun try, from which it appears, that in one year, 1783, it suffered from 949 Earthquakes. Their effects are still visible : I have witnessed some of them with an anxiety of mind not to be im agined. The ordinary action of the elements can never efface them. It can only be effected by some convulsion even more terrible than its pre decessors. It will easily be imagined that as Heat is the prime agent of one of the prevalent Geological theories, and is so intimately connected with Vol canoes and Earthquakes, that many disputes have arisen on the subject. They may however be"], [129, "119 reduced to three, viz. \u2014 as to the Intensity, the Situation, and the Origin of Volcanic Fire. Messrs. Le Sage and Deluc, and afterwards Do lomieu, made a series of experiments on Lava, which was found to vitrify more completely in fur naces than in volcanoes ; and many crystals that were embedded in it were easily fused ; whence they concluded that volcanic fire was not so very intense, and that its effects were caused, rather by extension and duration, than by activity. Sir Jas. Hall overthrew the force of these experiments as far as vitrification was concerned ; inasmuch as vitrification, according to his experiments, does not depend so much on the degree of heat, as on the rapid cooling of the stone or lava. He was further confirmed by the valuable ex periments of Mr. Watt, proving that if the process of cooling be very slow indeed, a crystalline ar rangement of the particles is the consequence. Observations, made by men who are capable of judging, are far more important and conclusive than any experiments ; and from a comparison of these we are entitled to conclude, that sometimes the heat of volcanoes exceeds that ofthe most pow erful artificial furnaces : but that the fluidity and heat of lava does not always indicate such intense heat. Spallanzani passed a current of lava upon Et-"], [130, "120 na, that flowed 1 1 months previously and which was still red hot at some distance beneath the sur face. The Abbe Ferrara mentions that when in 1 709 they opened at Catania the current which flowed from Monte Rosso 40 years before, flames broke forth, and the retained heat was so great even at the beginning of this century, that rain, when it fell upon it, passed off immediately in vapour. Upon opening some houses in Torre del Greco, nearly buried in the lava of Vesuvius in 1794, iron utensils were found partially volatilized, and some crystals of iron (specular) discovered on the surface. We know on the other hand that many crystals, easily fusible by the blow pipe, are ejected unal tered by volcanoes. In the list of substances vomi ted forth, we find many that were, and many that were not fused. Here is a specimen that sets all caballing at rest \u2014 a piece of lime, with an embed ed shell, sent forth during an eruption of Vesuvius, and presented to me by Sig. Monticelli, so well known as having indefatigably studied this volcano for many years. As to the Situation of volcanic fire, viz. whether it originates in the mountain itself, or is placed at a great depth below the surface : It has been sup posed that volcanoes originally break out in"], [131, "121 mountains already formed, and merely cover them with lava and scori\u00e6. For instance, that Vesuvius and Etna were always mountains, either primary or secondary, and that volcanic fire has only alter ed their forms perhaps, and covered the surface with lava, &c. On the other hand, it is asserted that these mountains are entirely produced by sub terranean heat, and composed of the lava and scori\u00e6 thrown up \u2014 as the Monte Rosso (already noticed) and Monte Nuovo, near Naples : or else that they have been raised by subterranean heat, which has softened and elevated the strata above it, as mentioned in the tract ofland in South Ameri ca, and on this a volcanic crater had been formed similar to the Jorullo. To a calm and unimpassioned man, to the phi losopher, both of these views will appear nearly correct. There can be no doubt that Monte Ros so, Monte Nuovo and Jorullo were formed by er uptions even had we not the testimony of witnesses: and we are justified in concluding that the source of the heat was far below the base of these hills. But there are many other volcanoes, to which such origin cannot be attributed. On Etna, for instance, we find calcareous strata, with imbedded remains of shell fish resting on beds of volcanic tufa, and dip ping to the sea. Here the inference is plausible."], [132, "122 that the first eruption took place beneath the sea, and that the strata with marine organic remains were deposited before the mountain rose from the ocean. In fine, that the volcano existed be- fore the mountain \u2014 that its first eruption was submarine, and the whole masses subsequent- ly elevated, or the sea depressed. The same may be said of the Peak of Teneriffe and of the Canary Islands. There is a great difference between the elevating and breaking up of strata, and the mere accumulation of lava and scori\u00e6, of which the celebrated Island Sabrina was formed in 1811 off St. Michaels inthe Azores. Itis prov- ed by both phenomena that the location of volcanic fire is far below the surface. Were it placed in the mountain itself, we cannot conceive why. after burning 1000 years, the walls do not fall in ; and when once extinguished it would be very strange that it should occur again in precisely the same spot. The supposition of the School of Werner, that volcanic fire is seated in coal beds, is very inade quate : \u2014 the depth would not be great enough for the production ofthe consequences \u2014 the sides here too would fall in ; and why, when once burned out. and extinct for 700 years and upwards, should"], [133, "123 it break forth again in the same place ? A coal pit near New-Castle (upon Tyne) took fire in 1 648, and burned for 40 years, when it was ex tinguished, without a sign of volcanic fire. Some philosophers have supposed that fire ex isted universally in the bowels of the Earth, and that the contact of water with it produced steam, the immediate cause of Earthquakes, which, when it found an opening, was expelled in the form of an eruption. Thus, they say, the Earthquakes of Ca labria and Sicily were always accompanied by eruptions of Vesuvius or Etna : thus, during the Earthquakes, formerly mentioned, of Lisbon, fire was seen to rise in the middle of the Atlantic : thus the Earthquakes of New Andalusia and the West Indies are connected with the volcanoes of the Andes : thu6, when Caraccas was destroyed in 1812, St. Vincent, dormant for 100 years, broke out afresh. The night when Callao and Lima were de stroyed, four new volcanoes appeared on the Andes. All these circumstances probably gave rise to the opinion prevalent among the vulgar in some parts of the world, that the interior of our globe is the De vil's workshop, to which volcanoes are the chim nies. The bottom of the Mediterranean between Sicily, the Lipari Islands and Naples, is covered with volcanic substances : and Humboldt considers"], [134, "124 the Mountains of Quito, 700 square leagues, in extent, one immense volcano, throwing out flames at different cones. The Origin of volcanic fire was formerly attribu ted to fermentation below the surface, which was not only explained and illustrated, but a recipe for making them composed. If any of you wish for a volcano on a small scale in your garden, take 25 lb. of powered sulphur, and as much iron filings, mix them into a paste with wa ter and place the whole in a large iron pot, covered with a cloth, some little distance under ground. In a few hours, from 9 to 12, the earth swells, heats and cracks \u2014 hot sulphurous vapours arise, and the cracks enlarging, a brilliant flame bursts up, thus forming a volcano in miniature, spontaneously produced by the reciprocal action of water, iron and sulphur. Thus spontaneous combustion was supposed to arise from the contact of water with iron pyrites, which contains both iron and sulphur. A district in Dorsetshire (Eng.) abounding in pyrites, after a heavy rain, in a hot summer, took fire and burned for a long time. Sulphur and Bitumen have been supposed to give rise to volcanic phenomena ; but though sul phur always is, bitumen has never been found in"], [135, "125 volcanic products. Monticelli has lately detected free sulphuric acid, an important discovery. The true cause of volcanic fire is probably not to be sought for in the combustion of such inflam mables as we find on the surface of our globe ; but in the chemical combination of elementarv matter tt composing mineral substances. The existence of volcanic fire, then, is proved by the fact itself, as appearing in volcanoes ; the connection of volcanoes with each other, and with earthquakes, proves its situation to be very far be low the surface; the original cause ofthis fire, and the reason of its breaking out occasionally with greater violence, are among those mysteries which still continue to elude our grasp \u2014 and will proba bly remain forever hidden from the knowledge of mortals. 18"], [136, "LECTURE IV.

Before entering upon a description of them, it is necessary, however, to premise that a knowledge of Mineralogy is in some degree essen tial to the study of Geology, ofwhich it has been. not unaptly, styled the Alphabet. Nearly all min eral substances are found either as constituents of rocks, or as occasional substances imbedded in them. There are not many minerals entering into the composition of rocks : The following; enumeration"], [137, "127 is perhaps complete.

Nodules, Veins, Irregular Masses, Beds, Strata, Irregular Masses, may be of any size ; and often constitute mountains, as is the case with granite, serpentine, porphyry, and the overlying rocks, as trap, &,c. Beds are of various sizes ; often running into ir regular masses : They are straight, or curved, and frequently intersected by joints, so as to assume a cuboidal appearance. Few rocks assume this form : those most disposed to it are granite, porphyry, syenite, and greenstone or hornblende. This dis tinction is considered, by Dr. Macculloch, as be ing practically the most easy, and perhaps the only one necessary for the student. Beds and irregu lar masses often give out veins that penetrate the adjoining rocks. Strata have been confounded with beds, but they are generally much iaiger, and usually are more extensive in two dimensions than in the third : so that strata may be considered as immense beds with the upper and lower surfaces parallel, ifj most"], [139, "129 cases ; but occasionally meeting at a very acute angle. Strata do not. necessarily preserve the same thickness, and often vary in the course ofa few yards ; nor are they always straight ; frequent ly being contorted and flexed into larger or smaller curvatures, which may be either parallel or transverse to the plane of stratafication. This form of rocks is of various extent, some times being discernible only for a few hundred yards, and at others being well defined for hun dreds of miles. Strata are found at all angles with the horizon, and in all relative positions to each other and the adjoining rocks. A rock is not necessarily of the same modifica tion through the whole extent ofa stratum, as the texture may vary to the widest limits of fine and coarse. Strata never send off veins into adjoining rocks. Modules, or imbedded irregular masses, is a term lately adopted to include rocks which are not stratafied nor disposed in pseudo strata (beds), and which do not resemble in their connections other large irregular masses. The forms ofthe Nodules are various ; and they are usually imbedded in the stratafied rocks ; but occasionally in granite. The size varies from a foot to a mils. Limestone."], [140, "130 Serpentine and compact Felspar alone have been found of this rare division of form. Veins are known by their filamentary forms, and by intersecting all other forms of rocks and each other. As this is an important subject and one that has given rise to much Geological disputation, it may be well to enlarge upon it ; premising that the school of which Hutton was the founder, con sider veins to have been filled from beneath by the action of fire : while the disciples of Werner maintain thnt they were filled from above by aque ous solution and infiltration : all acknowledging that they occupy places or fissures originally open. Veins are simple, or they exhibit branches or ramifications : the latter are more generally met with in Granite. The size of veins varies from a mere thread to several hundred feet in breadth, being smallest usually in the primary rocks, and from one foot to several miles in length. The relative position of veins is extremely di versified, intersecting rocks in all directions, form ing every possible angle with the horizon, and dipping to every point of the compass : the course ofa vein being straight or flexed."], [141, "131 It has been observed that veins, except those of quartz and calcareous spar, are limited to granite and the overlying family, or the traps, syenite, and porphyry. Rock veins are often traced to some irregular mass, though not in all instances. They may tra verse several different formations, and are always different from the rocks they traverse. Contemporaneous veins differ from true veins in many particulars. The breadth is seldom more than a few inches, the length varying from half a foot to more than an hundred feet. The course is scarcely ever straight ; and they give off many branches. They are usually intimately connected with the walls of the rocks in which they occur \u2014 sometimes passing into them insensibly differing but little in composition, and often being one ofthe constituents. 1 hus granite contains contempo raneous veins of quartz, of felspar, and of mica.

The Internal Structure and the Texture ol Rocks have been recently divided, and treated of separately : the following are the different varie ties of structure. Laminar : which may be divided into the lamel lar, foliated and schistose. In the former division of this structure, a rock divides more or less easily into plates, seldom con tinuous or allowing further division. The lamellae are not necessarily straight, and occur from a few lines to many yards in thickness. They are sometimes divided by natural joints, and then assume a prismatic a cuboidal figure. There is a large and a small lamellar structure : the former is seen in granite, the latter in hcrrn- 19"], [144, "134 blende. This structure occurs in masses and veins. The foliated structure occurs in the mixed rocks only, and is defined to be \u00ab rather a tendency to split into parallel lamin\u00e6, or an appearance of parallelism in the disposition of the integrant mi nerals, than in the property of actual splitting.\" Tne lamin\u00e6 are irregular, and often curved : a? is usually seen in foliated rocks. They are sel dom continuous or even; when they are, the structure is passing into the schistose. The schistose structure is evinced by the fisility of the rock on the use of force : being rarely affect ed by the weather ; while foliated and lamellar rocks are. This modification of structure is found in simple as well as aggregate rocks. The thickness of the lamin\u00e6 is inconsiderable ; the length varies from half an inch to several yards. They are sometimes even and smooth, at others rough and nodular. They are not necessarily straight. This structure occurs only in strata. The schistose sometimes run into the next divi sion of structure. Fibrous is confined to argillite and limestone. It is sometimes parellel, straight or curved. The fibres sometimes diverge, presenting a ramified appearance."], [145, "135 Spheroidal comprises all varieties of concretiona ry structure. The concretions may be spherical, touching only at points, the interstices being filled. At times, by compression, they become ovate, and assume irregular shapes. Sometimes they have a radiated structure ; and sometimes contain a nu cleus. In some cases this structure is observable only when the rock is weathered. The size ofthe concretions seldom exceeds an inch and is at times very minute. In some cases this structure is confined to spots in the rock, and then the concretions are large and irregular. Prismatic, including columnar structures. The common prismatic is a modification of the large la minar, divided transversely by natural joints : be ing cuboidal or quadrilateral, seldom having a less number of sides. By the action of weather, or by partial decom position the angles are often rounded, so as to pre sent a spheroidal concretionary structure : which is also caused by the desquamation of crusts. In columnar structure there is no limit to the number of sides, and the length is much more than the breadth. In such instances as exhibit a very short prism, the structure becomes tabular. This structure is always aggregated. No instance having Occurred of a single column."], [146, "136 The prisms are often seen in parallel ranges forming a bed for some distance ; and sometimes pass imperceptibly into the massive rock. When parallel and upright, their beauty and regularity is remarkable, and has given eclat to \" Fingals Cave\" in the island of Staffa. Parallelim is not necessary ; since they are sometimes found diverging as from a centre; occasionally in confused heaps, and again dispersed and entangled, as it were, in the massive or amorphous variety. Nor are columns always straight ; being sometimes much bent in the same direction, or in contrary directions, or mixed with straight ones. The prismatic structure occurs in veins as well as beds. It does not necessarily exclude the small er kinds of structure, as the amygdaloidal and por phyritic. The size of prisms varies from an inch or less, in diameter, to several feet : in basalt they occur occasionally 9 feet thick, in iron stone sometimes the tenth of an inch. In length from 1 to 300 feet\u2014 or perhaps more. They occur with all number of sides from 3 to 12. Prisms are usually divided by irregular joints. destroying the appearance of continuity. The most perfect and numerous joints are seen in the most regular columns. Occasionally they are so frequent"], [147, "137 as to produce tabular prisms.

Veined, comprises all those veins confined to one rock, and which consist ofthe same substance as the matrix. One or more veins may be found separate, or confused in the mass \u2014and occasionally the same appearance presented by the veins is observable in a patch or spot at a distance from it. The size of such veins differs from half an inch to a few feet \u2014 both in length and breadth. Their hardness usually resists decomposition, and causes them to be raised above the surface. Sometimes they are discerni ble on the fresh fracture, at other times not till the matrix is in part worn away. They often intersect each other, exhibiting a reticulated surface, show ing that in the interior of the rocks lamin\u00e6 cross each other. Trap and granite are more frequent ly veined than other rocks. Cavernous. When in the last mentioned structure. the intervening walls or veins no longer appear small, but constitute the greatest portion, it passes into the cavernous, which is seldom seen on the fresh fracture ; but frequently when the surface is partially decomposed. The cells vary in size. shape and frequency \u2014 and are often filled with"], [148, "138 some substance different from the constituents of the rock. This structure is often seen in sand stones and limestones. Amyo-daloidal and the preceding are often found in the same rock. The caverns or cells are filled with different mineral substances, appearing to be imbedded. These vary in size and shape. This structure is mostly confined to the over lying family, and to rocks of volcanic origin. Aggregate evinces a composition of the fragments of different rocks \u2014 as the brecciap and conglom erates and sandstones. The parts consist of one or more rocks, with quartz \u2014 united sometimes with, and sometimes without, any apparent cement : the size varying from a grain to several feet. The frag ments may be rounded or angular \u2014 sometimes, but rarely, both are found in the same mass. Granular, also called crystalline, exhibits grains of one or different minerals closely aggregated, as if by confused crystallization, usually of small size. It is difficult to be distinguished from the last variety. Porphyritic, where crystalsof one or more minerals are included in a simple or compound base.

By this term is understood the appearance ofa new surface of a rock, upon being broken. It de pends in a great degree upon the texture ; the small fracture more particularly. There are several modifications of fracture. Even ; in which the surface is a plane, without, or with a very small degree of curvature. Uneven : in which the planes are variously in clined, and form by their angles, elevations and depressions. When minutely uneven, with the ele vations and depressions considerable, it becomes granular, and forms a texture."], [151, "141 Conchoidal. In this fracture one surface is con cave, and the other convex, to a greater or less extent, and frequently marked by curved lines, more or less parallel. There are several accidental varieties of this fracture: two distinct concavities may occur, the smaller within the larger, or there may be several small conchoidal appearances producing an undu lating surface. These three varieties may be united, or pass into each other. They may also be united with some of those that follow. Splintery, is produced by wedge shaped scales. straight or curved, ofwhich the thin edges are more or less elevated, and occasionally transparent. In the large splintery fracture, the scales are of considerable breadth in proportion to their thick ness, and are flat or curved. It occurs frequently in connection with the choncoidal. In the small, when the splinters are very narrow, they may exhibit something of a fibrous aspect :\u2014 when thick and short, something of a granular ap- pearance. Hackly fracture is rare \u2014 occurring only in some schistose rocks. It is known by the extreme sharp 20"], [152, "142 ness of the protruding parts. It may be well seen. by the transverse fracture of aggregated fibres. The granular, fibrous, and scaly fractures are si milar to the textures with those names. Hardness. This character of rocks is so various that it is impossible accurately to describe it. It ranges from the hardness of quartz to that of chalk. \u2014 These extremes are well known, and the interme diate varieties must be tested by some equally known standard ; as the comparative ease with which they are scratched by the point of a knife, or the finger nail. To strike fire with steel is an inadequate test, as that depends often on the form of the fragments, and is frequently produced by the intermixture of quartz. Colour. Among the external characters of rocks none va ries so much as colour\u2014 and still it has often been insisted upon as characteristic. In some instances the colour is well defined, as in limestone, serpentine, &c.\u2014 but in many cases the tints are broken ; and those comprised un der the ceaseless changes of grey are the most pre dominant. Different colors are sometimes present"], [153, "143 in the same compound rock : and occasionally de pending on the colour of several substances united in the mass. Iron, in some of its conditions, is usually the agent by which rocks are coloured. The endless variety of colours affords a name for every shade which may be found in rocks \u2014 but as the colour of the same rock frequently changes, this character does not belong to the permanent catalogue. Still it merits attention, as frequently forming species which in economical purposes are highly prized \u2014 a6 in marbles. Mr. Symes of Edinbugh has published a work on colours wich deserves notice by those who wish more particularly to attend to this character of rocks or minerals. FrangibiUty. This character is very various, as some rocks yield to a slight blow, and others resist a great force. It depends in some measure upon the wa ter the rock contains, and the direction given to the applied force. When the interior of a mass is broken it is often frangible for the time, but becomes tough by exposure. To convey the proper idea Ofthe frangibility ofa rock, it must be compared to some familiar object,"], [154, "144 Lustre. This character varies from that of plubmago, the highest degree of lustre found in rocks, to that of chalk, which is dull and earthy; in fact to the total want of lustre. The shades are not very nu merous, and are often indefinite. The standard however being fixed, a reference is easy and suffi ciently definite for common use ; thus there are six degrees of lustre referred to, viz : the plumbaginous, the silky, the resinous, the vitreous, the flinty, and the waxy. The latter offers a double standard of comparison, in its lustre, after having been melted, and in the fracture it presents when broken. Transparency. The thin edge of a splinter of rock may trans mit a small degree of light, and be translucent, but although transparency belongs to several min erals, it does not properly appertain to rocks. Specific gravity, This character is of little or no value in the com parison of rocks. When the weight ofa rock is mentioned, the specific gravity ascertained in the usual mode, should be noted, so as to convey a dp finite idea,"], [155, "145 Action of Acids.

All geologists agree in assigning an extreme date to Granite \u2014 and it is usually placed as the first, or lowest of primary, and therefore of all rocks. It is considered as unstratified : is one of the most abundant, and most useful of rocks. It derives its name from its usual granular appearance. It is placed in irregular masses beneath all other strata, occasionally sending veins into the adjacent rocks. It seldom presents a definite form : but is occasionally so divided by fissures as to make it bear some analogy to stratification. When these crevices or fissures are so placed as to produce a prismatic figure, the angles are sometimes rounded off, and an irregular spheroid is the result. Granite sometimes presented a minute, but irre gular prismatic structure, independant of the above."], [157, "147 It is also occasionally minutely laminar, or exfo liates in crusts, that are sometimes concentric, sometimes flat ; in some cases appearing the result of a concretionary structure in the rocks ; in others as the consequence of atmospheric action. The component parts of Granite are Quartz Mica and Felspar: of these three substances I shall give a brief notice \u2014 not intending it however as a precedent to be followed in describing the other rocks : but to show the necessity for an intimate acquaintance with mineralogy, previous to com mencing the study of Geology. It will also show the connection between mineralogy and che mistry. Quartz is a siliceous earth very plentifully distri buted.

Granite therefore consits of quartz, felspar, mica and hornblende in different proportions. Other minerals too sometimes enter into the compound \u2014 viz : actynolite, chlorite, talc, compact felspar and steatite. The size of the grains of granite varies from a minute speck to several feet in length. It is so fine as scarcely fo be distinguished from sandstone, and so coarse as to be almost a conglomerate ; and these gradations may occur almost imperceptiblv in a short distance. In one locality alone, Corsica, it is orbicular.

Where the lamin\u00e6 allow mica slate to split into large tables, it is useful for fences and for many domestic purposes. The origin of granite has been a subject of warm discussion to those geologists who regard theory as the most important part of the study \u2014 and it has received different explanations from the differ ent schools. The Wernerians regard it as a deposition from aqueous solution, which was followed by the other rocks ofthe same class. They account for granitic veins by a new deposition entering crevi ces and fissures of the original strata. These granite veins are supposed by the Hut tonians, on the contrary, to have been elevated by some power below; so that granite is the latest, instead of the earliest rock, has been con solidated by heat, after the other depositions were made, and forced up so as to be elevated, with all the other strata resting upon it, to an in inclined and even vertical position. This explanation does not agree with the local ity of many veins that can not be traced to any or iginal mass or mountain \u2014 of which kind many exist."], [172, "162 The elevating by these means of such immense masses of granite as mount Blanc and Chimborazo appear scarcely credible. As Geology became a subject of study and at- tention, it was found that the three rocks already mentioned, by no means constituted even the greater number of the primary class. The most important addition was Argillaceous Schist or Argillite: important for many reasons. It was ori- ginally considered as appertaining to the next class of rocks, and by being introduced here blends the Primary and Transition \u2014 as even those sections of Argillite which are termed primitive are allowed to pass imperceptibly into the transition. On this account the arrangement of Macculloch seems highly proper \u2014 and I shall follow him in placing under this head \" all those schistose argillaceous rocks, of the primary class, (in which he includes the old transition,) however differing in texture ; thus comprising the clay slate and the graywacke of some geologists.\" His reasons are sound, so far as my observation or reflection goes. In all cases, the coarser and finer varieties of this rock occur as parts of one series, however the one or the other variety may predominate in particular instances. If fine beds or strata are found without the coarser, or if the later are found"], [173, "163 without the finer, it offers no greater reason for their separation than is offered for a similar division of gneiss or mica slate byits coarse or fine textures. These textures too occassionally present them selves in the same bed, either laterally or trans versely. Moreover, in the case of sandstone this arrangement is adopted for similar reasons, no dis tinction being made between the fine and coarse varieties, although the differences of conglomerates and fine sandstones are much greater than is ever met in Argillite. And why should not strata, mecha nically recomposed, be found among the primary. as well as among other rocks. The only differences that have ever been offered between the older and newer varieties of this rock, are negative. Such as the absence of nodules or compact limestone, in the former; the want of chiastolite, of numerous beds of greenstone, of alum slate and drawing slate \u2014 and even these characters are so dubious that the most experi enced geologist may be al a loss, as Argillite fre quently shows all varieties in a small space. The essential components of Argillite are the peculiar indurated clay which alone forms all the simple varieties, with mica and quartz \u2014 The coarse varieties, or greywackes, contain also primitive fragments : felspar is sometimes found in it, giving it"], [174, "164 a porphyritic appearance. These circumstances produce different kinds of texture : the finer is compact and uniform : other varieties occur from the mixture of sand, gravel and mica. In the old er kinds, the mica is in large scales and assimilates it to mica slate, while in the newer the mica be comes very small and fine. In the compact varie ties as hone slates &c. the union of parts is too firm to be a mere mechanical adhesion : but gene rally indurated clay is the cement. It passes into siliceous schist and into sand stone. Argillite sometimes composes whole coun tries, but is occasionally only in small quan tities, alternating with other rocks in a very curi ous way. On this continent it is found supporting im mense countries, as all the table land of St. Fee de Bogota \u2014 in Peru it rests immediately on an cient granite. Indeed the gradations are insen sible of granite, gneiss, mica slate and argillite. Thus a large country exhibits gneiss constantly alternating between granite and mica slate : and mica slate between granite and clay slate, whence some geologists have been desirous of joining them as one formation : in the same manner that syenite and serpentine pass into that greenstone called"], [175, "165 transition. In Cornwall it rests near to granite In England it occupies large tracts, and is followed in order by the secondary rocks. Although it may be difficult to trace the outline ofthe beds, the stratafication of argillite is not dis puted. In large tracts it is frequently of immense thickness; but in alternations it becomes very thin, in the same manner as micaceous schist: and in the same way too the strata are liable to contortions, but seldom the rock itself. The schistose structure of this rock renders it valuable for many purposes, since it can be split into lamina of almost any thickness, particularly the finer varieties ; though often the graywacke schists are divisible to the same extent. This ten dency is not necessarily, though it is generally parallel to the plane of stratafication : it is some times oblique, but never in the secondary slates. \u2014 The finer varieties present sometimes a fibrous structure. Natural joints are sometimes transverse or ob lique to the plane of stratafication, forming rhom boidal or prismatic figures, more or less perfect. Most frequently the intersections are made by minute and numerous veins of quartz or calcareous 23"], [176, "166 spar, which in some rare cases follow the contor tions ofthe schist.

Large quantities of it are annually brought from Rensselaer county to Albany and to this city. In the counties of Ulster and Dutchess it occurs of such quality as to be wor ked advantageously. Pennsylvania possesses it in Wayne county, in Lancaster and in York, extending into Maryland. These quarries yield annually about 1600 tons \u2014 worth 22 Dollars a ton. It occurs near New Haven in Connecticut and is extensively quarried at Charlestown, Mass."], [177, "167 It has been traced by Dr. James and Mr. Eaton about 30 miles on the Hudson. In the United States it has an extent of about 400 miles North and South. The acclivities of Argillite are not very steep \u2014 and the soil yielded by its decomposition is better than what is generally afforded by the primary rocks. These four rocks form the great divisions of the primary class-but do not constitute it, as there are many other important members ofthis series, which were formerly treated of as subordinate beds. \u2014 Divisions in all branches of science are readily made, but distinctions not so easily. In consider ing them as distinct formations I am borne out by the result of the observations of Humboldt and Macculloch \u2014 and no other authority need be cited. The short portion of time allotted for this course allows of no discussions, nor would they be profit- able. I shall therefore proceed to an account ofthe other members of the primary family. Some of them are indeed very small, but not less important in a geological point of view. Serpentine, is a beautiful rock presenting some shade of green mixed with white, yellow, brown or"], [178, "168 red ; and its name has been derived from the fanci ful arrangement ofthe colors, bearing some resem blance to the skin of a serpent. Its surface is glossy, though dull, and offers to the finger that saponaceous feeling, so peculiar to all magnesian rocks and minerals, indicating the presence of Magnesia. It seems to hold the first place among these less extensive members of the primary class in any ar rangement founded on the age of rocks, as it is not unfrequently found resting immediately on granite. It does not appear to be stratified, nor is there any reason for supposing it to be so. It differs from all unstratified rocks in having no veins run ning into the neighbouring strata. In Aberdeenshire it is included in granite ; but in Great Britain it occurs mostly among gneiss, argillite, hornblende rocks and limestone, and occasionally in mica slate. It rests, forming the chief component of white stone, on ancient granite, in the Erzeberg. It is occasionally covered by gneiss and sometimes by mica slate. A small formation of it in Saxony rests on gneiss, and is not covered by any other rock In S\u00b0. America, on the mountains of Higuerote, it occurs in a similar position. The large formations of this rock are posterior to argillite. With whatever rock Serpentine may be connect ed, it forms intimate associations. When in con-"], [179, "169 tact with limestone, the two rocks frequently blend. A gradation may be sometimes traced from serpentine to hornblende, to which it is intimate ly connected. It has been observed that when veins of trap pass through secondary limestone, it is converted into serpentine during its passage, and by an interchange of the imbedded minerals be longing to either, a gradation may be established between trap and limestone. It is sometimes connected with carbonate of lime, and thus forms the beautiful marble called verde antique. The texture varies from highly crystalline to com pact and earthy. It is susceptible ofa polish, and is highly prized. The precious serpentine is in small quantities, and is very beautiful. Serpentine is the repository of many imbedded minerals, some of which occur in such quantities as materially to alter its character.

It forms the top of Monte Rosa, and of Pindus\u2014 and of the Appenines generally. In this country it forms an insulated mass at Ho boken. At Rye, W. Chester, it occurs, and will re ceive a good polish. Near New Haven it is found with large beds of lime stone, and is quarried ex tensively. At Westfield (Mass.) it is enclosed in granite, in very small quantises. Primary Limestone is a very interesting rock, of which our information is not very accurate. It is only by a close examination of the geological position that it can be known \u2014 as it bears a strong resemblance to the secondary marbles \u2014 and more particularly to that portion usually called Transi tion, and thus offers another argument to Dr. Mac culloch for his wishing to embrace this latter class in the Primary Rocks \u2014 It is a remarkable rock, composed almost entirely of calcareous matter. The colours are so various as scarcely to be subject of definition They are usually derived from inflammable matter, from a mixture of other substances\u2014 or from iron.

Many of the noblest monuments of Grecian artists are in marble. The white marble ofthe Alps and ofthe Vallais is highly prized. The grand cathedral of Milan is built of primary marble from the Lago Maggiore, as well as the suberb triumphal arch of Napoleon, which his spiritless successor has left unfinished \u2014 \u25a0 a monument of his illiberality and want of taste. I shall briefly notice a few of the more valuable and rare antique and modern marbles; though this belongs more particularly to mineralogy. The Parian marble of the ancients was snow white, with the slightest possible tinge of yellow, the grain fine, and when polished the appearance was somewhat waxy. By exposure to air it har dened, and thus resisted decomposition for centu ries. It receives the most delicate touches of the chisel, and retains them for ages, with all the soft ness of wax and the mild lustre ofthe original polish. The finest Grecian sculpture that has descended to us, is in this marble. The Venus di Medici- the Venus of the capitol\u2014 the Diana Venatrix\u2014 the Colossal Minerva, the recumbent Ariadne\u2014 Juno Capitolina, and Diana and the Stag, in the Louvre, are all formed ofthis marble,"], [182, "172 The Pentelic marble, from mount Pentelicus, near Athens, closely resembles the preceding\u2014 but is more compact and of a finer grain. When the Arts, at a very early period, had attained their full splendor in the age of Pericles, the Grecians pre fered this marble to the Parian, probably because it was nearer. The Parthenon was built entirely of it \u2014 as were many Athenian works, erected du ring the administration of Pericles, as the superb temple of Ceres, or Eleusis. Among other beautiful relics are the torso of the Belvidere \u2014 and the muses of the Vatican \u2014 and in Paris, a Bacchus in repose \u2014 the throne of Saturn \u2014 and the tripod of Apollo. It was remarked by Dr Clark that while the works executed in Parian marble remain perfect, those finished in the pentelic marble have been decomposed. The marmo greco was obtained from Scio and Samos, in the Archipelago. The white marble of Luni on the coast of Tusca ny takes so fine a polish and \"so delicate a touch that the Grecian artists latterly prefered it to all others. The Antinous ofthe Capitol is of this mar ble, and the Apollo Belvidere, \u00ab the statue that en tranced the world.\""], [183, "173 T he white marble of Carrara is ofthis formation. The quarry was first opened by Julius C\u00e6sar and it has ever since been highly prized. Foreign marbles were introduced to a great ex tent among the Romans. Pliny, who wrote 166 years after the first importation of marbles, remarks the rapid progress that had taken place in that period, from a simple and unadorned way of life to magnificence and extravagant expense. In the reign of Diocletian, 240 years afterwards, the im portation of foreign marbles was discontinued, as the columns employed in the baths of Diocletian were taken from more ancient buildings. The large and superb obelisk in the Circus Maximus of Rome, was brought to the city after this period however. Its removal from Egypt was began by Constantine, and finished by his son. For remove ing this, it may be remarked, the largest wrought stone ever moved in Europe,there existed sufficient mechanical skill at that period, although the arts connected with design had considerably declined.

The shafts of the columns in the hall of Representatives in the Capi tol at Washington are of this breccia : they are nearly 2 1 feet from base to capitol, and 2 feet in diameter. A block of 70 feet long, with a base of 1 1 feet by 7 1 has been procured. The quarries of New Milford about 3 miles from New Haven, afford fine and beautiful marble\u2014sim ilar to the verde antique. The Swanton marble (Vermont) is a superb and excellent variety, and will eventually be much used. The Smithfield marble of R. Island is valuable. The marble quarries of Massachusetts are the most valuable in this country. The West Stockbridge marble is much used \u2014 and produces to the owners about % 30,000 annu ally. In Lanesborough about #10,000 worth is yearly sold. The marbles of Berkshire sell for about #40,000\u2014 and those of Sheffield for #8,000 yearly. Primary limestone is found in strata, of all forms and magnitudes\u2014 also in nodules or large irregu lar masses, in gneiss, and in veins, when it is crys talized. In the Pyrennees, it is considered by Charpentier as an independent formation. In South"], [186, "176 America it is found, coarse grained and white, simi lar to the finest Carrara, which Humboldt for a Jong time thought an independent formation. In the Pyrennees and in the Alps it is common, but in America, beds of it, subordinate to rocks of granite- gneiss, are more rare. In Scotland it occurs in granite; when it is as sociated with mica slate or gneiss, the mica enters into its composition and gives it a laminar struc ture. The beds usually follow the direction of the accompanying rocks. The following minerals, with others, are found in limestone: Serpentine, Steatite, Stilbite, Olivin, Idocrase, Actinolite Asbestos. Mica, Garnet, Emerald, Beryl, Tabular Spar Tremolite, Sahlite, Talc, Chlorite. Quartz, Brown Spar. Pyrites. Spinelle, Titanite, Sphene, Augite, Hornblende, Quartz Rock has been established as holding a place among the primary rocks. Dr. Maccul loch, Humboldt, and Von Buch first gave us cor rect ideas of it. It is generally white, with a smooth, brilliant surface, or is tinged with reddish, yellowish, or dark purple tints."], [187, "177 Its aspect is usually granular \u2014 the size of the grain varying: rarely is compact or crystalline. In its purest state it has different aspects : thus, in some cases, it has a granular, crystalized appear ance : in others, the texture is a mixture of the mechanical and chemical : and again, it is purely mechanical. The cavities may contain regular crystals. When much blended with felspar, it takes the reddish tint of that mineral, and the texture be comes changed, so as to exhibit a mere agglutina tion of grains of different sizes, and in different proportions. It has a foliated disposition, and the lamin\u00e6 are easily separated into very thin plates. This rock is sometimes found to contain mica, particularly when resting on mica slate, and is split into lamin\u00e6 of such thicknes, as to allow of its being used for architectural purposes. A simple quartz rock 1800 feet thick exists at an elevation of 1600 feet above the sea in South America. Like the primary rocks, with which it is in con nection, it is stratified ; the distinctions of beds be ing as decidedly marked in some cases as in sand stones. The dimensions vary from an inch to ma ny yards ; and having natural joints, they break into rhomboidal or prismatic fragments."], [188, "178 It has no certain position, being occasionally found alternating with all the primary strata. \u2014 When alternating with gneiss the limits are scarce ly discernable. as the felspar becomes gradually more abundant, and the other components less. When alternating with mica slate, its beds are very thin, and the mica insinuates itself into the mass \u2014 thus producing a very gradual change, so as to render doubtful the line of demarcation. This is not always the case, for when they alternate in large beds, the outlines are much more decided. Quartz rock alternates with argillite also, in la min\u00e6 of various dimensions ; generally on a small scale. In some cases, they almost insensibly glide into each other ; in others their separation is very distinct. It alternates also with greywack schist > and sometimes, says Dr. Macculloch, with primary sandstone, which it strongly resembles, but always on a larger scale. M. Von Buch remarks that in Scandinavia the primitive clay slate is sometimes represented by quartz rock, thus making them geognostic equi valents. In South America, the quartz rock has been examined by that indefatigable observer, Hum boldt. He found this formation containing alter nating beds. 1 \u2014 auriferous quartz. 2 \u2014 chlorite"], [189, "179 slate. 3 \u2014 auriferous quartz and tourmaline. 4 \u2014 auriferous quartz and specular iron ; and some of these beds are IOOO feet thick. It is to the destruc tion of these beds that, some suppose we are origi nally indebted for platina, gold and diamonds, and also for the topaz and euclase of Brazil. Some English geologists have denied the right of quartz rock to a separate place ; and chiefly be cause there is so small a quantity of it in Europe : But in America it decidedly takes rank \u2014 a locality of it is seen running from Canada, through Ver mont, Massachusetts and part of New-York, an extent of more than 300 miles. At Brighton, near Boston, it occurs of various colours. It contains few imbedded minerals : garnet, hornblende, titanite and oxydulous iron occasion ally occur. Chlorite Schist has only lately been deemed of such importance as to be called a rock. It is of a greenish color, passing into grey, and into the pale grey of the micaceous schist. The greenish specimens have the most lustre. It does not form very extensive tracts of coun try, but is sufficiently well marked in its charac-"], [190, "180 acters to induce the best geologists oi' the present day to assign it a distinct name. It is so nearly allied to micaceous schist, with which it is intimately associated, that some geolo gists have doubted the propriety of a separation. It alternates also with gneiss, and by insensible degrees enters into that rock. With mica schist, argillite, gneiss and primary limestone it forms a very interesting geological series in Scotland. When the beds are thick, it is strongly assimi lated to mica schist, is flexed and is imperfectly di visible. It is more generally the case that the strata are thin, when it is more easily split into lamin\u00e6, but is seldom applicable to economical purposes. In texture, it partakes of the characters of the rocks with which happens to be most intimately united at the locality \u2014 as micaceous schist, gneiss, argillaceous schist. It never contains fragments of other rocks. The essential constituents are quartz and folia ted chlorite, which is to be distinguished from scaly chlorite. The green tint of the former is the most convenient character by which to dis tinguish it from mica, and from micaceous schist."], [191, "181 Other minerals occasionally enter into its com position, as felspar, hornblende, mica, actynolite and compact felspar. The imbedded minerals are usually crystallized chlorite, quartz, oxydulous iron, tourmaline, brown spar and pyrites. East of Troy chlorite schist occurs in strata be tween two and three miles wide, and sometimes rising into hills 200 or 300 feet high. On the Milford Hills, in Connecticut, it is found in strata between primary limestone and horn blende ; and at West Haven, it forms extensive strata, passing perhaps into argillite. Talcose Schist is another rock that has* only been lately spoken of separately in geology and it is to the observation of Macculloch that this, as well as the last rock, owes its elevation. It is similar to the preceding rock, being com posed of talc, or talc and quartz, with an occasion al, though rare, intermixture. Its colors are white lead grey and dark obscure green. The pecu liarities of talc sufficiently distinguish it from other rocks. It is not common, nor abundant \u2014 but alternates very distinctly, as a rock, with other primary strata. The constituents of chlorite or micaceous 25"], [192, "182 schist give those rocks a very different character from the present. The strata are usually thin ; and it might have been retained as a simple mineral did it not occa sionally show itself in large masses. Associated with hornblende schist, it often forms thin beds in a series of gneiss. It is often formed by an imperceptible passage from micaceous schist : sometimes too from chlorite schist ; and occasionally from argillaceous schist. In all these cases, the two first particularly, it is associated with minerals having an affinity to talc, as steatite and asbestos. It is also associated with serpentine. \u2014 It presents no structure particularly to be noticed : itis sometimes minutely undulated, but not flexed like micaceous schist. It contains the following minerals. Asbestos, Actynolite Cyanite, Diallage, Automalite, Staurotide, Chromate of iron. Pyrites. Perhaps the regular strata of talc, described by Professor Hall, as occurring in Windham, Ver mont, is Talcose Schist. Hornblende Rocks have given rise to much dis cussion in Geology, and are variously viewed by different Geologists."], [193, "183 Brochant arranges under this head greenstone. greenstone porphyry, and verd antique. Bakewell considers Trap as a generic term. embracing greenstone, basalt, amygdaloid and whinstone. Eaton includes primitive trap, sienite, green stone porphyry and green porphyry under the Hornblende Rocks. Macculloch, under Hornblende Schist, speaks of hornblende rock, primitive greenstone, and green stone slate. When hornblende becomes slaty in its structure, it is usually termed Hornblende Slate. When intermixed with felspar, it is then Green stone. The proportions of the two ingredients are different ; but the hornblende usually predomi nates and gives the greenish tinge. If this variety become slaty it is called Greenstone Slate Hornblende rocks are not always composed of but two constituent parts : sometimes admitting in to the compound quartz, mica, talc, lime and iron. which latter decomposes by the action of air, and disintegrates the mass. Epidote is occasionally present in these rocks, which are then susceptible of a fine polish. When the felspar is in crystals it is called porphyrytic greenstone ; and this variety, when very dark and fine, was called by the an-"], [194, "184 cients Black Porphyry. The green porphyry of the ancients is very compact, and embraces crys tals of felspar. It is often colored by epidote.\u2014 This is found near Boston. Greenstone beds are occasionally very large, forming mountains,usually conical, with mural pre cipices. It is not confined to the primary class. In this country it is common. Ii forms the sum mits of all mountains between the primary range and the Hudson. The Palisades are ofthis rock; as is Mount Holyoke, in Massachusetts, where the columns are from 60 to 1 00 feet long, articulated like basalt. In Maine, on the Kennebec, it also occurs. Dr. Macculloch terms them all Hornblende Schist, on the supposition, that the other rocks, usually called hornblende, are but subordinate parts ofthe great beds, having the schistose struc ture \u2014 and that the structure varies from massive to schistose in the same bed. Humboldt thinks the independence of greenstone slate doubtful. Hornblende Schist rarely forms extensive tracts, without alternating with other primary strata. Its most intimate association is with gneiss, in moderate and thin strata, so as almost to form a subordinate bed, but in other cases to equal it in quantity and importance. It follows the flexures"], [195, "185 of gneiss and is penetrated by the same veins ot granite \u2014 passing however into gneiss by the ac quisition of quartz, and alternations of horn blende. In the same way it also alternates with, and in sensibly runs into micaceous schist ; in which it is usually accompanied by chlorite schist, presenting sometimes a prismatic structure. It is not often associated with argillaceous schist, but is occasion ally, when it also passes gradually into that rock. It passes into Actynolite schist, which is erected into a separate rock. It often presents minute undulations, like mica eous and chlorite schists, besides following the large flexures of the laminar varieties. The texture varies according to the component parts \u2014 but the granular, crystalline, and laminar are the most common : in the latter case being fissile ; in the former, massive \u2014 (being the horn blende rock of many.) It has not been found to contain fragments of other rocks, and its texture may be set down as truly crystalline or chemical. Its components are felspar and hornblende,often the latter alone: thus differing from micaceous and chlorite schists, which always contain two minerals, one of them essentially quartz. Mica"], [196, "186 and Chlorite only are very rarely contained in such quantities as to alter the genuine rock. The color is black or a green so dark as not to be distinguished from it The colour of the fel spar produces varieties of shade, as it approximates white, green, or red Pyrites and garnet are the only minerals found in this rock \u2014 the latter sometimes very abundant. It is used for building stone, and in the prepara tion of water proof mortar. Actinolite Schist is mentioned by Macculloch as a distinct rock; thus following, as he remarks, the ideas of Saussure. who asserts that it occurs in gneiss, under a distinct character. \u2014 It is dis tinct from chlorite schist. In all its associations it is similar to hornblende schist, with the exception of a more intimate connection with chlorite schist. It differs from hornblende schist in composition only by the substitution of actynolite for horn blende. It is to be remarked, that while actynolite continues to be considered as a distinct species from hornblende, so long must the two rocks be separated. At Brunswick, Maine, it forms a stratified rock of considerable extent, associated with granular quartz."], [197, "187 Porphyry has been placed among the primary rocks, though Humboldt doubts its existence as such, unless in subordinate beds \u2014 in the same way that gneiss and mica slate of the high Alps, become granular, and, from the insulation of fel spar crystals, assume a porphyritic aspect. He considers porphyries as more closely connected with coal-sand-stone. Porphyry has a compact base, containing crys tals distinctly visible, chiefly of felspar or quartz, the base forming the specific term, as compact fel spar, or clay stone, pitch stone, or clink stone. Its color is reddish, brown, purplish, or green. Its general appearance is not unlike granite. Felspar porphyry is found near Boston, and equals in beauty the antique varieties. The base is compact felspar, and has been mistaken for jas- per. \u2014 It is occasionally slightly granular, or a little foliated. The fracture is usually conchoidal, somewhat splintery or uneven. H gives fire with steel. When the crystals of felspar decompose, small cavities are produced: even the base is liable to decomposition, but is protected from the action of air and moisture by being polished. It is often susceptible ofthe finest polish, and has been much employed in the arts. It is very du-"], [198, "188 rable, and was highly prized for architectural pur poses by the ancients. The extreme hardness alone of porphyry and granite has caused their neglect. It should not form an objection. Inde pendent nations who build not in fear of revolu tions should have durable materials. Some of the most beautiful ornaments of Rome are of this substance ; the urn of Constanza. and the urnof St. Helena are each formed from a large block of porphyry : and the great tazza, or saucer shaped reservoir in the rotunda of the Museo Pio Clementino is one immense piece of porphyry. Pliny says that the sculptors began to use porphy ry under Claudius. The room in which the prin ces of the Greek empire were born was encrusted with it : and these princes were called Porphyro geneti. The name of this stone was taken from the ancient purple dye made of the Tyrian shell fish called porphyrios, whence it is supposed that the ancient dye was of this dull red colour. There is a small grained greenish porphyry. more highly prized than the red variety. Sienite is another, and the last of these rocks. By the substitution of one ingredient for another, granite is so insensibly converted into sienite, that"], [199, "189 at first sight it does not strike us. This is effected by the existence of hornblende in the granite, which becoming more abundant, at last supplies the place of quartz, and forms a compound of which hornblende and felspar are the two constant and essential constituents: but in which mica and epidote may occasionally blend. Felspar is usual ly the most abundant, and occasionally the horn blende is in very small quantities. The necessary presence of hornblende as an ingredient, distin guishes this rock from granite in which hornblende is imbedded. It derives its name from Siena in Upper Egypt, where it abounds, and whence it was brought in great quantities for employment in architecture and sculpture, by the Greeks and Romans. Its structure is granular and sometimes slaty. The color varies with the predominating consti tuent ; the hornblende often gives it a greenish tinge, as does epidote : the felspar is mostly red dish, or whitish. When there are large crystals of felspar contained in a fine grained sienite, the mass is termed Sienitic Porphyry. It will have been observed, that sienite and greenstone are both composed of felspar and hornblende. They are in fact the same rock varied by a transition so \u2022\u25a0\u25a0\u2022entle as to be imperceptible : thus, granite 26"], [200, "190 changes into sienite, which runs into greenstone: but that section ofthe chain in which hornblende predominates is greenstone, and where felspar is the most abundant, it is sienite. This rock is occasionally associated with all the primary rocks, resting on granite, gneiss, and ar o-illite \u2014 and alternating with all the lesser members ofthis family. It is not an abundant rock. It is plentiful on the west shore of Lake Cham plain. In many places in Massachusetts it is so abun dant as to be quarried. The Stone Chappie in Boston, the State Prison at Charlestown, and the prison at Lechmere Point are of this stone. The two celebrated lions at the steps ascending the Roman Capitol are of sienite ; as is also the famous Collosal Egyptian Head in the British museum. Humboldt doubts if it ever occurs as a primary rock, except as a subordinate bed, or as an indepen dent primary formation. Such he thinks are some sienites resting on gneiss, and partly covered by primitive mica slate. He mentions the Sienite of Paramo, placed on granite and covered by slate."], [201, "191 These are the substances usually treated of in Geology, under the head of Primary Rocks : to them Humboldt has added \" Euphotide,\" a variety of serpentine rock ; or a mixture of diallage and lamellar felspar. It is the Gabbro of de Buch. It seems to be most intimately connected with mica slate and hornblende schist. All these rocks are not necessarily present in every primary country : i. e. they do not univer sally hold the same position, since part of them may be absent. Indeed we have been taught dur ing the last twenty years, as M Humboldt says, that we are not to expect precisely the same rela tive position in the constituents of the great forma tions. The great laws, however, regulating the succession of rocks, in the structure of the globe, are in all countries the same ; and striking analo gies in the position, composition, and included or ganic remains of contemporary beds exist univer sally : and viewing formations in a general way we are almost taught to believe their universal identi ty. But identity of formations is not to be looked for, any more than the constant operation of the same law in mechanics. Like causes produce like effects \u2014 but obstacles may present occasionally to interrupt them \u2014 thus occasionally one rock may represent another : in which case there is not"], [202, "192 an identity in all formations, but parallel forma iions, or geognostic equivalents. Nor in comparing widely distant countries, are we to look in one country for an equivalent for every rock in the other, as one formation may represent many others. Thus the beds of clay below the chalk, in France, may be easily separated from oolitic limestone ; but in our hemisphere, South of the Equator, they have marl for geognostic equivalents to represent them. And these beds, by the way, may in the same manner, represent the chalk in the United States. The striking similarity of structure in different countries has been examined and acknowledged by the best geologists : thus the position and succes sion of formations has long been a subject of study to Humboldt; (whom I liberally resort to) and in South America he soon recognised the conformity of superposition in the two continents, and found them fully develloped in the formations exhibited from the 21\u00b0 N. Lat. to the 12\u00b0 S. Lat\u2014 where he says the types were rather enlarged than altered. From the Canary Islands to within the polar cir cle (as far as the 71\u00b0 N. Lat.) we have undoubted testimony of the uniformity of position, and of the analogous features that characterise formations in the most distant regions."], [203, "193 The associations of rocks, upon comparing im mense fields of observation, we may say. are near ly as constant as their composition. The com pounds are made up of the same simple minerals, and in turn compose mountain masses, in which the same rocks are found in a similar position. This uniformity of position is observed usually in rocks of all formations \u2014 but more particularly in the larger, or older, as in the Primary and Secon dary : it does not follow that it is found in inde pendent formations. These independent forma tions are so called from the fact, that they rather escape the law of uniformity of position, being placed indiscriminately on granite, micaceous schist, and secondary limestone. The position of independent formations however does not neces sarily exclude uniformity of position. It has been doubted by some whether the same rock was deposited at the same time in different parts of the globe. \u2014 Most Geologists assign the same date to a deposit wherever it may be found : this is expressed by the term Isochronism of forma tions. Formations of analogous composition are al lowed to have been produced at different and dis tant periods \u2014 these however are formations not in cluded in this general law \u2014 as Primary and Se-"], [204, "194 condary Limestone. Organic remains go far to prove this Isochronism, and the existence of the same fossils in similar though distant beds affords strong proofs. \" It has more than once been desired that we could find a supplement to our short annals in the monuments of nature. The historical ages might, however, have sufficed to teach us, that the succession of moral and physical events is not re gulated by the uniform process of time, and cannot, in consequence, furnish its measure. We see, in looking back, a succession of creations and dis tinctions, by the various arrangements of beds that form the crust of our globe. They give us an idea of several distinct epochas : but these epochas, so fertile in events, may have been very short, compared to the number and importance of the results. Between the creations and destruc tions on the contrary, we see nothing, whatever might be the immensity of the intervals ; there every thing is lost in the mist of indeterminable antiquity, the degrees of which cannot be appre ciated, because the successsion of phenomena has no scale that can be referred to the division of time.\" (Mem. de l'lnstitute, 1815.1"], [205, "195 1 have mentioned that several of the rocks we have described, alternate with others, with which they are associated. When the same rocks are placed several times alternately upon each other, they are said to alternate, and it is often by this in terchange of places, that they insensibly become blended and run into each other. Thus v\\ hen two formations succeed each other immediately, it generally happens that beds ofthe one begin at first to alternate with beds of the other, until a new formation succeeds without any subordinate beds. In primary rocks the three most ancient are said to be either insulated, or alternating two and two, or all three alternating together. Granite and gneiss in some cases are constantly associated, in others gneiss and mica slate. In all cases there are certain laws ; \u2014 granite, gneiss and mica slate are sound in a triple association ; but granite al ternating with mica slate only, or gneiss and mica slate alternating with argillite only, are said not to occur. Those rocks passing insensibly into others with which they are in contact must not be con founded in this way \u2014 as micaceous schists that oscillate between gneiss and argillite, are not to be confounded with such rocks as alternate. and preserve distinct all their characters."], [206, "196 In treating of mountains, I have mentioned their usual direction as being frequently the same. The parallelism of beds, called also Loxodrom ism, is very surprising. The primary beds on the coast of Genoa, the plains of Lombardy\u2014 the Alps of St. Gothard\u2014 Swabia and the north of Ger- many, were first noticed by Humboldt to run almost constantly from south west to north east \u2014 and this was one of the reasons that led him to South Ame rica, where he noticed the same in the chain of mountains running from the lower Oronoko to the basin of the Rio Nigro, and the Amazon. This Loxodromism has already been mentioned in speaking of the uniform direction of mountains from north east to south west. This is the direction of our Allegany Mountains, one of our most interesting geological features. From the sources of the St. John River, New Brunswick, it runs south west to the junction ofthe Alabama and Tombigbee Rivers. At the distance of from 40 to 80 miles it follows and skirts the At lantic, forming a mighty barrier to a mighty ocean. Granite, gneiss, and micaceous schist, each form a considerable part of this immense ridge. Gra nite is found on the tops of mountains and on"], [207, "197 plains, and is frequently so decomposed as to have lost adhesion for 50 or 100 feet below the surface, exhibiting only sand and gravel. Gneiss is more widely distributed \u2014 and covers nearly half ofthe primary ridge, including immense beds of granite, some of them 300 feet thick ; in which beds are found the Emerald, Tourmaline, Garnet, &.c. Micaceous Schist and Argillite are also widely distributed. Primary Mountains may be said generally to be unfavorable to vegitation : their extreme hard ness, their precipices, and unfriendly soil, doom them to barrenness. Lichens and mosses attached to their sides decay, and furnish soil for larger plants \u2014 Water penetrates and breaks off masses \u2014 the influence of air, water, heat and light assist in the progress of disintegration \u2014 and insensibly, but uniformly and constantly, aid in converting stones into bread \u2014 or, in other words, in preparing soil from the most sterile rocks for the support of ani mal and vegitable life. The decomposition of granite is slow, and when decomposed the unfriendly siliceous grains are easily washed away. There is neither vegitable nor animal matter in the compound ; it does not absorb 27"], [208, "198 moisture, letting the water percolate ; \u2014 nor does it retain heat. The soil made from gneiss is not washed away quite so easily \u2014 and the mica yields it more ar gillaceous earth \u2014 but it is seldom deep (from 20 to 100 feet.) Micaceous Schist and Argillite decompose more rapidly, and form a better though not a good soil. The rivers of primary districts have rocky beds and precipitous banks. Upon the whole, Primary Mountains are covered with a soil less productive than the other classes of rocks \u2014 and form the barren regions ofthe Arctic, and the sterile plains ofthe Torrid.

They never attain the elevation of the preceding rocks, and are more liable to de composition. They are considered as not crys talline. They are the oldest or lowest rocks in which we find any record of vegitable or animal existence, and may be regarded as ancient re-"], [210, "200 cords, imprinted with the natural history of the inhabitants ofthe globe. They repose on the primary class, and form a contrast to their bold precipices and rugged peaks, by their less pointed, and more beautiful outline.\" Jn retaining the term Transition, I do violence to my own opinions. The division of rocks in which that term is adopted is unnecessary and per plexing. I have elsewhere given reasons for not employing it \u2014 the following may be mentioned. The Rocks called Transition, are often as pure ly chemical in composition as any other rock. Many of them contain no organic remains. There is no definite boundary between them as a class and the primary. And lastly it is a division of no practical importance : and one that is very perplexing to the student. In America, they have no line of demarcation, and are often absent altogether. If we place these rocks among the primary, as some Geologists do, we shall then have natural limits to every class \u2014 the red sandstone being placed between the primary and secondary \u2014 and the chalk between the secondary and tertiary. I shall however retain this name, as I do not consider my own authority sufficient to banish it,"], [211, "201 although in so doing, I should but follow the most natural division, and be upheld by some of the best geological enquirers. The rocks usually described as transition are but varieties of those we have al- ready mentioned \u2014 viz. Argillite, Greywacke, Limestone, (metalliferous) Gypsum, Porphyry, Sienite, Greenstone. Argillite. \u2014 It is but a few years since this rock has been assigned to different formations ; having until lately been termed Transition. But when en quirers into nature began to examine for themselves and were no longer led by the great masters ofthe opposite schools, the structure of the Earth was more thoroughly examined, and new facts discover ed, which tended to clear up many ofthe supposed inconsistencies in geological speculations : thus the oscillations and alternations of beds and strata cleared up the supposed irreconcileable positions in which masses were occasionally found, and which no theory accounted for. The composition of transition Argillite is the same as that of the primary, viz. Siliceous and"], [212, "202 Argillaceous Earths, Magnesia, Lime, and Oxide of Iron. It has various shades of grey, varying to pur ple, red and green. It is soft and easily decomposed ; and is fusible. It rests upon gneiss or mica slate. It contains beds of limestone, and alternates with the rocks in its vicinity, frequently having greywacke interposed. It splits into lamin\u00e6, and is then useful for va rious purposes : that which is easily divisible into thin plates, and is compact and sonorous, is term ed roof slate. Some varieties of it are used for writing slates. It frequently abounds in iron pyrites, which ren ders it unfit for use. It also contains alum slate. and flinty slate. It is an abundant rock. That termed transition is more plentiful than that before noticed. The ele vations composed of it are usually tabular and flat. I have already mentioned that Argillite is quar ried in Rensselaer County. In the vicinity of Hudson, it is seen forming the banks of the river, and is found on and near the banks of the Hudson as far north as Fort Miller."], [213, "203 It frequently contains metallic treasures, in Guanaxuato, in New Spain, this rock is traversed by a vein that for 17 years produced annually 556,000 marks of silver. A mine in this rock in Valencia yielded 360,000 marks of silver annually for 40 years. Argillite sometimes contains porphyry and sien ite. In the North of Europe the three alternate. When Argillite contains imbedded grains and masses of indurated clay, quartz and flinty slate, it then forms what is termed Transition Greywacke, denominated fine or coarse according to the size of the grains : when the former variety is slaty, it is then called Grey wacke Slate, which is in fact coarse argillite. and by a combination with mica, passes into mica slate. It alternates with flinty slate and limestone. In England two formations of Greywacke alternate with two formations of limestone. It is closely allied to the preceding rock, argil lite passing into greywacke slate, which has a homogeneous appearance and a slaty structure. \u2014 It is distinguished from it only by its grey color, and by the glimmering of the mica it contains. In a general sense, Greywacke means, accord ing to Humboldt, every conglomerate, sandstone, or puddingstone, fragmentary or arenaceous rock"], [214, "204 of transition formation, that is anterior to the red sand stone of the coal formation, (old red sand stone.) In a more limited sense, it is confined to the arenacious transition rocks, which contain only small fragments of simple substances, more or less rounded ; for instance, of quartz, of lydian stone, of felspar, and of clay slate, but not fragments of compound rocks. In the latter case, the term greywacke is inadmissable, and the name of brec cias or conglomerates, with large primitive fragments, is given to various agglutinations of pieces of gra nite, gneiss, and sienite. Calcareous puddingstones are those m which rounded fragments of carbonate of lime are cemen ted by a base of the same. Coarse greywacke passes easily into conglomer ates with large fragments, and alternates with those of fine grain and homogenious aspect. The puddingstones and breccias with large fragments of primitive and compound rocks are true grey wackes. Greywacke is metalliferous. It is often traver sed by quartz. The novaculite, or hone slate, be longs to it, as does the rubblestone or rubble wacke which is connected with the Catskill Moun tains."], [215, "205 Redwacke is seen in a layer between the vil lage of Catskill and the mountain, which has now become so fashionable a resort. Mr. Eaton says that this rock underlays all the western part of our state. In Rensselaer, Wash ington, and Columbia Counties, it is often met with covering extensive tracts. Alternating with these two last mentioned rocks occurs a Limestone, called Transition Limestone, Metalliferous Limestone, and Carboniferous Limestone. Part of this formation is the Mountain Limestone of some Geologists, who treat it separately. It is compact and has not the crystalline structure of the limestone formerly spoken of. Werner called the lower beds ofthis rock transition limestone, and the upper he termed fl\u0153tz \u2014 but this distinc tion is justly abolished ; and the two are properly spoken of together. Humboldt has divided it in to granular talcose limestone, and black limestone, but places both under the same head. Their characters coincide \u2014 and it is only their relative position that induced Humboldt to give them these names in his excellent work on the superposition of rocks. They are both metalliferous, and con tain traps and amygdaloids. They occur in vast masses, and form mountains with perpendicular cliffs and steep ravines. 28"], [216, "206 The lowest beds usually rest on argillite, with which they alternate. They contain some carbon, (about 0.75 or j pr. ct.) whence they derive their colors, which vary, usually having a greyish hue, and always darker than the primary. The stra ta are not well marked, and are of great thickness. Organic remains are rare in this rock \u2014 the cata logue is, however, very curious and instructive. \u2014 The black limestone contains orthocerat tr,s several feet long \u2014 entrochites, madrepores, pectinites and ammonites. It is extremely difficult to draw the line of boundary between the upper and lower beds. Some of the celebrated marbles of antiquity be long to this deposit \u2014 as the marmor luculleum \u2014 the nero antico \u2014 the African flowered marble \u2014 the pavonizzo, and, according to Humboldt \u2014 the gilded breccia. \"I have already mentioned that a difference ot opinion exists in regard to the manner in which we find the series of these rocks contorted. It is from the limestone series that many ofthe argu ments are drawn. The strata of limestone countries present many interesting phenomena\u2014 and which, if we allow the action of either of the discordant agents, is easily accounted for. The arguments of Hutton."], [217, "207 Playfair and Hall are specious, and to him who hears only the arguments of one school, carry conviction. That the undulations of strata have received their several characters in a horizontal position, can readily be imagined and easily ac quiesced in. But not so with the irregularities, contortions and disruptions. Here the other school interposes, and is strongly aided by argu ments drawn from nature. It must be admitted, that when Hutton allowed a certain agency to wa ter, and a certain power to the action of subter ranean heat, he combined the good of both theo ries, and appears above the rank of a mere theorist. The upper portions of this deposit contain peculiar fossils\u2014 many ofwhich appertain to spe cies now extinct. Itis a singlar circumstance that a part of our globe should be covered by animal secretion, yet such is the fact, as was shown when speaking of coral reefs. In this and the succeeding rocks, organic re mains, or petrifactions, become so frequent, as by many to be supposed characteristic of the differ ent beds in which they are found\u2014 Of the accura cy of these remains as a geological standard, 1 have spoken elsewhere ; but I cannot omit here to"], [218, "208 mention the sentiments of Humboldt, who, in treat ing of these rocks, observes, \u00bb Although we are yet far from being able to complete the history of ma ny intermediate and secondary formations by an enumeration ofthe fossils found in them, we shall indicate some that characterise this group \u2014 (in which he includes transition argillite, with grey wacke, greenstone, black limestone, sienite and porphyry.)

In the newer beds of limestone, calymene blumen bachii, (found on the Miami) asaphus caudatus of Brongniart, ammonites, terebratulites, orthocera tites, some gryphites, and encrinites.\""], [219, "209 This formation is to be studied in many placet in the western part of our state. At Trenton Falls on West Canada Creek, a place now often visited, it contains many of the beautiful fossils pecu liar to it. Orthoceratites, nautilites, terebratul\u00e6, product\u00e6, encrinites, and trilobites \u2014 among which is the beautiful new genus of Isotelus, lately insti tuted by Dr. Dekay.* Gypsum, porphyry, sienite and greenstone are found among these rocks : Gypsum, however, does not occur in sufficient quantity to be noticed. In deed it is doubted if in a geological system, it should be mentioned at all, except as an occasion al rock, as other than secondary, it is so sel dom found in this place. According to Brochant it is found in connection with transition limestone. Porphyry, sienite, greenstone and amygdaloid have already been noticed : they occur here in small quantities as occasional rocks, or rather as alternating with others, and have some characters distinct from their earlier beds \u2014 being less crys talline and more compact. Porphyry, having a base of indurated clay, is usually mentioned as transition porphyry. Its fracture is dull and earthy. It is moderately hard *See Annals of Lyceum of Nat. Hist, of N. Y. vol.

Oc casionally it contains nodules with a centre of cal cedony. It is liable to decomposition, and resem bles volcanic products. When in the vicinity of coal, it contains vegitable remains. Porphyry alU mates mostly with argillite, sien ite. greenstone and black limestone. In South America all the porphyry is found in the most western and elevated part of the conti nent, none being found east of the Andes, through out the whole eastern part of South America. The Cordilleras contain perhaps the greatest mass of porphyry : it is particularly rich in gold and silver ; and associated intimately with rocks produced or changed by fire. The limits between the transition porphyry and volcanic rocks of South America are not easily traced. The porphyry of Mexico is rich in silver and gold. The pit of del Encino furnished 50,000 marks of silver annually for a long time. In 1726-7, two workings in South America yielded 542,000 marks, almost twice as much as all Eu rope and Asiatic Russia in the same time. Most of the porphyries of South America ex hibit a tendency to a regular stratafication, which is seldom observed in Europe."], [221, "211 Sienite and Greenstone have already been mentioned, as transition rocks ; they occur in in timate association with each other, with porphyry and with amygdaloid ; the hornblende of porphyry often becoming more distinct in the sienite, and finally abounding in the compact and sonorous greenstone. When the crystals imbedded in por phyry are exchanged for oval or diamond shaped substances, the mass is called Amygdaloid. Indu rated clay, greenstone, or wacke, may constitute the bed, and the almond shaped nodules may be calcareous spar, quartz, zeolite, hornblende, calce dony, agate, epidote, felspar, &c. &c. One mine ral only is usually found in a cell ; but occasion ally there are two or three surrounding a nucleus. At Mount Holyoke, in Massachusetts, it occurs precisely similar to some European localities. It is found near Boston, and frequently in Vary land. In the synopsis at the end of this work, these substances will be found mentioned. These are the unimportant varieties of the pre ceding rocks usually classed as Transition, but which in fact should be considered as primary, where Lehman placed them, and whence they should never have been removed."], [222, "212 We often find that novelties in Science are re prehensible. Few are capable of understanding and appreciating the many and often distant bear ings that one point has upon many others, and of discriminating between the relations they bear each other. A fancied difference does not always constitute a true distinction. It is this accuracy of discrimination which placed some of the oldest naturalists so far above many of our own day ; and assigns to Linn\u00e6us a place, to which all the research and philosophy of a more enlightened period can elevate very few of the living na turalists. In accounting for rocks other than the primary, the theories of Geologists coincide, as both Wer ner and Hutton considered them as original depo positions from aqueous solution \u2014 But the situation of the strata as we now find them, has caused much discussion. That they were originally hori zontal is granted : the question is, how were they placed in the inclined or vertical position ? The disciples of Werner, or the Neptunian school, sup pose that in the original formation of these rocks, there existed immense caverns, such as we often see at the present day, and that these have fallen in, and thus caused the inclination of beds, &c. ; a"], [223, "213 supposition rendered in some measure probable by the immense extent of many existing caves \u2014 by the quantity of water now running through them\u2014 and by the great power which it is known to exert. In all Limestone countries they exist even now \u2014 and rain and moisture oozing through crevices may have filled many, more or less, the softer parts of the wall may have been dissolved or worn away \u2014 and the roof and super-imposed strata have fallen in. It is urged against this theory, that instead of the strata having fallen in, the primary rocks have been forced up into the superincumbent mass. The disciples of Hutton, or the volcanic school, conjecture that after these strata were hardened, they were elevated with the primary rocks, then in a state of igneous fusion, by some force below. The recent discoveries of Sir Humphry Davy have been supposed to throw light on the expansive power of heat, and to furnish strong evidence in favor of this theory, which is said thus to stand the test of experiment, and to be more clearly explain ed by the progress of knowledge. On the other hand, it is asked what is that influence exerted by Alpine chains on beds at the distance of of 400 miles ? Is it a fact that there existed at the same Teat depth a force which heaved up mountain? 29"], [224, "214 and bent the strata ofthe plains, so that the bent edge of those strata, formerly horizontal, are now all inclined at nearly the same angle ? Were the Alpine chains heaved up ? If so, it is singular that they issued from fissures all parallel to the direc tion of the pre-existing inclined beds. The secondary rocks repose universally on those we have already described. They are less elevated, and their angles with the horizon less than the preceding. They have an unconforma ble position to the primary, usuall \\ , though not necessarily. It may, however, be laid down as a rule, that all rocks succeeding to any one rock that is unconformable in position to the prima ry, belong to the secondary. Red sandstone is the lowest that has universally this position, and may therefore be justly mentioned as the oldest secondary rock, and all above- it belong to the same class. They rest on the sides of primary ridges or at their feet, and compose the interven ing vallies. Their texture is more or less earthy, very rarely crystalline. They are often mechanical mixtures composed of parts of the primary rocks, united by cement. Their horizontal position and the presence of large numbers of animal and vegit able remains are also characteristics. Thev are"], [225, "215 usually unstratafied. None of these characters are so invariably marked as the geological posi tion; \u2014 the associations of a rock being among its most valuable and steady characters. The number of secondary rocks is much more limited than the primary, being confined mostly to sandstone, limestone and shale\u2014 but present a great variety in detail, even independent of their organic contents. The extent and depth of secondary rocks are also more limited than the primary. If they were not often absent, the primary would never be seen on the surface. The primary, in ftct, constitute the great mass of the globe \u2014 while the secondary are partial, as a covering to them. The primary may be considered universal, since they bear the same characters in every part of the world ; and could we have access to them, they would most probably be found in a similar and uniform posi- tion every where. The secondary can only be considered universal, inasmuch as similar rocks occur, as far as their chief characteristics are con- cerned, in every part of the globe But they are not continuous, and therefore only partial \u2014 even perhaps partial in a more limited sense, as some varieties are peculiar to certain countries, and not found at all in others. Their laws are not so gen-"], [226, "216 eral, operating only on a limited or local scale, while the laws of the primary seem to have ex tended over the whole globe. The occasional absence of these secondary is owing to two causes. The action of the elements, which in the lapse of ages, must have destroyed them partially ; and the original deposition seems to have been often local, and confined to concavi ties, technically termed basins. The chief members ofthe Secondary Class may be reduced to four, viz. 1. Red Sandstone, or Great Coal Deposit. 2. Alpine Limestone \u2014 or Magnesian Limestone: with Rock Salt. 3. Arenacious and Calcareous Deposits ; which embrace the variegated sandstone, or new red sandstone, gypsum and rock salt, shell limestone, sandstone, lias, marie, oolite, ferruginous sand and green sand. 4. Chalk. Red Sandstone is one of the most important rocks of this class. It is also called old red sand stone to distinguish it from a newer variety called also red marie or variegated sandstone."], [227, "217 It is formed of the fragments ofthe preceding rocks or minerals \u2014 varying from coarse to fine, according to the size of the grains. It rests always on the preceding rocks ; varying in appearance as it is more or less mixed with ad ventitious minerals. The simple minerals enter ing into its composition are quartz, felspar, clay, mica, and carbonate of lime. The rocks, which by their fragments, contribute to the formation of this one, are all of the primary class. It contains few imbedded minerals, which re mark is applicable to all the secondary rocks \u2014 Sulphat of strontian and calcareous spar are the most common. It contains very few organic remains. Its color is red as the name denotes \u2014 varying from a bright ochre to the darkest brown, or even blackish purple. This rock is so immediately connected with coal, as to be treated of with it in all works on geology. Where beds of old red sandstone are associated with calcareous beds, good soil is generally pro duced. The summits of mountains composed of this rock are mostly covered with mosses."], [228, "218 Coal is so intimately associated with this rock, thatl cannot persuade myself to pass it unnoticed. Indeed its value and importance to our city ranks it among the most useful of all formations, and one of the most interesting of all mineral strata. I may perhaps be allowed to dwell upon it, as it is a subject of primary interest to our City and State. The oldest variety of coal that exists is the slight trace of carbon that we find occasionally in primary rocks ; but never in sufficient quantity to work. We are not to look for coal in any ofthe rocks that we described at our last lecture; nor in those that I have just mentioned It is never found in rocks older than the red sandstone, in connection with which it is most generally found, occasionally alternating with other rock or earthy strata. It forms one of the most important branches of geo logical science. The lateral extent of coal deposits, often called coal fields, is sometimes very considerable. \u2014 In many places they occupy basin shaped cavities, having all the edges turned up, and perhaps crop ping out : In other places they are inclined at such angles that their extent cannot be known, or con jectured. It is usual for more than one bed to be"], [229, "219 found in a deposit ; and sometimes ten or twenty are found. At Liege there are sixty beds alter nating with sandstone, limestone, shale, clay and sand. The thickness of a bed varies from an inch to many feet or yards. \u2014 The strata are gene rally divided by natural joints, more or less perfect and extensive, by which they are formed into cuboidal or prismatic masses. \u2014 They are usually laminar. The mineral composition of coal does not strict ly come within my province, yet as it is not gen erally understood, it may be noticed in the brief est possible manner. All the Bitumens from Naptha to Asphaltum, consist of compounds, apparently indefinite, of car bon and hydrogen principally : the small quanti ties of oxygen and azote which they contain, ap pearing to have little or no effect in modifying the mineral characters. In the most fluid, the hydro gen predominates, diminishing progressively ac cording to the order of their relative tenacity or so lidity. Where asphaltum ends this series, cannel coal, with some interruption in composition, and a considerable one in texture, commences that of coals. From this variety down to the most perfect anthracite, there is a similarly indefinite range of composition: the hydrogen generally diminishing as"], [230, "220 the coal becomes less inflammable, as it is less ca pable of being sepi rated into bitumen and char coal by distillation, and as it yields a smaller com parative proportion of the former. Thus the com position of the bitumens illustrates that of the se veral varieties of coal. The most perfect anthra cite appears to yield no bitumen, yet it contains hydrogen perhaps in every case; as that element is present even in common charcoal, which is it self a compound substance. Where anthracite passes to plumbago, which may in fact be con sidered as the true end of this series, the hydro gen seems to have disappeared ; and if this sub stance be not mere carbon, as it probably is not, from the apparent combustion which it undergoes, on exposure to air, when its base has been extri cated from iron under water, it undoubtedly ap proaches nearer to that element than any of the preceding substances. We all know that there are several varieties of coal, and tha* it is of the utmost importance to us as housekeepers as well as proprietors of land to know their distinctive characters and names. Anthracite, or native mineral carbon, or blind coal is the first we shall notice. It is not, strictly speaking, a coal, though combustible. Its color is black or brownish, but seldom the black of true"], [231, "221 coal. It presents the most beautiful irised or tar nished colors. It is harder than common coal, but breaks easily. It soils the fingers \u2014 has an unctuous feel \u2014 and is somewhat slaty. It burns slowly, and with difficulty \u2014 yielding little or no flame, nor smoke, nor bituminous odour. After burning it leaves about 23 pr. ct. of grey ashes. It yields no bitumen, and the very feeble flame, which it occa sionally exhibits, appears to arise from the hydro gen of the water it contains. Anthracite, like the Diamond, appears to be es sentially composed of pure carbon, but in a very different state of aggregation. That from Kilken ny yields 97 parts in 100 of carbon \u2014 that from Rhode Island 95. When once ignited, Anthracite yields an in tense and lasting heat \u2014 and much of the difficulty of kindling it may be avoided by the addition of a certain quantity of charcoal, and by the proper application ofa strong current of air. Being composed mostly of pure carbon, without any bitumen or sulphur, except occasionally from pyrites, it burns without caking, and is very useful on all occasions where strong and uniform heat is requisite. In all manufactories, and for the forge, it is inestimable. 30"], [232, "222 In speaking of the primary rocks, in our last Lecture, I mentioned that they contain no coal; i. e. \u2014we know of no coal mine in such rocks as gra nite, gneiss, &c\u2014 But this Anthracite, which I have stated is not a true coal, is found in the pri mary rocks. And hence it is obvious that this combustible has not proceeded from the decom position of vegetable substances, since it is gener ally acknowledged that the primary rocks were formed previous to the existence of vegetation. We have abundance of this combustible in the United States. Rhode Island coal is this very substance. It is there found near the surface covered by shale and sandstone. It contains 94 pr. ct. of pure carbon. In Massachusetts also it is found, and in some of our new states. In Arkansas it is of good quality and in abundance. The most extensive locality, and of the greatest interest to our city, is in Pennsylvania, on the north east branch of the Susquehannah, and near the heads of the Laxawanna, Fishing, Muncey, Le high and Schuylkill rivers. It extends down the Susquehannah to within 10 miles of Sunbury, and down the Schuylkill to within 20 miles of Reading, and is lost under Peters' Mountain. From the florth east branch of the Susquehannah. it. ex-"], [233, "223 tends about 30 miles east, but only 2 or 3 west.-\u2014 At Wilkesbarre, it runs under the river. It ap pears also at the surface ofthe country in beds of from 20 to 30 feet thick. This extensive forma tion is worked at several places \u2014 and the Lehigh, the Schuylkill, the Wilkesbarre, and the Laxa warina (or l.axau axen as it is called) are from dif ferent parts ol the same bed. and derive their names from the places near to which it is worked. At Wilkesbarre, it is quarried at the surface by means of gunpowder and wedges. The Lehigh coal, which is quarried a few miles from the river, has been deservedly brought into use \u2014 and is supposed to be worth double the value of Virginia coal. The Schuylkill is in all essentials the same. The Laxawanna is from the north east portion ofthe same bed \u2014 and has rather a larger propor portion of bitumen \u2014 so that it affords rather more flame, and cakes more than the others. We will all have an opportunity soon of forming correct estimates of their comparative value. Besides Anthracite, there is another mineral often spoken of as coal, which is in fact a different substance. I mean Lignite, of which there are several species, all derived from wood that has"], [234, "224 been buried below the surface, and decomposed. Jet, of which ornaments are made, is one species. The Bovey coal of England, is of this kind It does not occur in such quantities as to be quarried for fuel. At ('ape Sable (Maryland) it occurs in beds of 5 or 12 feet thick. At iv-artha's Vineyard it oc curs in small quantities. True coal is always black, and fining, com pact, and with an even fracture. It is too hard to be scratched by the finger nail. True coal burns easily, with a whitish flame, yielding a black smoke, and a slight, but not un pleasant smell of bitumen. It never leaves less than 3 pr. ct. of residuum, sometimes much more. It is essentially composed of charcoal and bitu men, in different proportions, the carbon chiefly predominating, and sometimes composing 3-4 of the whole. It is easily distinguished from Anthracite, which burns with difficulty, does not give a white flame, nor the black smoke, nor the bituminous odor of coal. The different coals pass into each other, but seldom or very rarely pass into anthracite. The cannel, candle, or parrot coal, the slaty coal, the coarse coal, and the sooty coal are \u2022mly varieties."], [235, "225 Coal is usually found in beds, at greater or less elevation. At New Castle, where there are 27 beds, it is upon a level with and below the sea. At Whitehaven it is 400 yards below the sur face, and the working extends 1700 yards beneath the sea. In our country coal is found at no great elevation : but in South America, at the table land of Santa Fe de Bogota, it rises I3H0 toises. or 13.500 feet above the level of the sea, and at Huanuco. it is 2 iOO toises above the sea, and near the limits of per petual snow. The Origin of coal is by most geologists attri buted to the decomposition of vegetable matters in the interior of our earth. The remains of ve getables that accompany coal, and the carbon and hydrogen of its composition, render this idea very probable. It has been objected that we sometimes find in beds of coal, vegetables that are scarcely decomposed. It is generally allowed that coal has been pro duced after the creation of organised bodies ; and that previous to its consolidation it has been at least partially fluid, either by solution in water, or by the action of heat under compression : which accounts for its crystalline structure, and often for the contained minerals."], [236, "226 There is a remarkable uniformity in the position of coal and its accompanying minerals, in all parts of the world. It is usually found under a thin layer of shale, which is called the roof. The stratum beneath the coal is called its floor. Whatever cause produced coal, it has been ma ny times repeated \u2014 hence the great number of beds of coal in the same mine, under the same circumstances. From whatever fluid coal was deposited, that fluid was in a state of rest at the time of the de- position, since the leaves of fern, &c. which are sound, are alwaj's in an expanded state. Jameson notices a trunk of a tree 40 feet long, rising through a coal formation. At New Castle, one was obser- ved 30 feet long, of which the trunk and large branches were petrified, or become siliceous, while the small branches, the bark, and the leaves, had been converted into coal. In the coal mine of Treuil. near St. Etienne, in France. '* are found a great number of trunks, pla ced in a vertical position, traversing all the layers ofa bed. It is a real forest ot monocotyledonous vegetables, in appearance res- mbling bamboos or the large equisetum petrified on the spot.\" Similar facts have been observed in the coal fields of Scotland, in the mines of Maneback, and in Saxony."], [237, "227 We have large quantities of coal in this country. \u2014Illinois, Missouri, Indianna, Kentucky, and Ten nessee have it in abundance. In Ohio there are all varieties of true coal. That of Virginia ex ists in great quantity. But here we again turn to Pennsylvania, one third of which state rests on coal. The west side of the Susquehannah river, from near the mouth of the Juniata, through all the country watered by the west branch ofthe Susquehannah and its streams, to Pittsburg, and thence down the Ohio and its streams, contains coal ofa good quality. At Pittsburgh it approach es the surface. It is to be observed that the situation I have here given to our true coal, is different from that assigned to the Anthracite of Lehigh and the Schuylkill. As this subject has become of great interest, and as much time and money have been expended in fruitless searches for this valuable article, mere ly from the want of a few simple facts, it may not be improper to not;ce a few circumstances which we should always have in mind, when coal is the object of our researches. It may be laid down as an invariable rule, that good coal in sufficient quantity to work, is never"], [238, "228 tbund in primary rocks\u2014 as granite, gneiss, &c. so that the idea of coal being found in the High lands of the Hudson, is without foundation. It is possible that anthracite may be found, but no coal. * Neither are we to look for coal on Long-Island, nor in the low lands of New Jersey. The Lignite or Bovey coal may exist there, and be valuable : but it is very doubtful if the quantity would be of consequence. From the position in which I have stated coal to be found, it is evident that at least one edge of every seam of coal must rise, in some place, to the surface: and we must examine all thoseplaces where strata have a chance of being exposed, as rivers, gullies, small streams, and ditches; from some of which we will soon learn the possibility of finding the object of our search. White and red sandstone are not always in company with coal \u2014 but shale, containing small balls of iron stone, and small thin strata, in the composition of which, and be tween the layers of which there is the slightest tinge of coal, are never found except near coal fields. * While correcting this proof, we have seen in possession of Dr. Dekay, specimens of anthracite, said to be found ia this locality."], [239, "229 Though the seam of coal comes to the surface, still it is liable to decomposition, and on that ac count may be found covered by and mixed with clay, gravel, or sand, in which case, the mass above is usually found to contain small pieces of coal. If these are found in a ravine we may be sure the seam of coal is higher up than the spot where they occur. Sometimes too, the superticies of a coal seam becomes in part dissolved, and presents a black friable bed on the surface ; and should this occur on a side hill, it often gradually descends so as to cover a large space, becoming thinner as it descends. This black bed is often found 40 or 60 yards from the real coal \u2014 and has often so deceived the inexperienced as to occasion im mense sums to be thrown away within a few yards of the coal, especially where the declivity is rapid, as then it is not so easily traced. It is necessary too to notice the strata of rock, and mark what angle they make with the horizon; and to what point of the compass they run. \u2014 Sometimes the coal runs parallel to a gully or ra vine for a long distance \u2014 and other times crosses it. In the last position it is more readily noticed. In the former, much trouble and cost is occasion ally the consequence. 31"], [240, "230 Even when the appearance of coal is found, and is favorable, it requires knowledge and judgment so to dig as to hit the bed. No accurate idea can be formed until the bed is so laid open to view, as to show itself between the roof and floor or pave ment. We may then judge of its thickness, as that rarely alters \u2014 we may also judge ofthe puri ty of the coal, as it sometimes contains stones or pyrites \u2014 also if it be hard or soft, or if it will burn well or not. Many beds of coal improve as they descend, and it is generally admitted, that all coal is better, that is found under a greater mass of superincumbent strata. Shale, or slate clay, or secondary argillite, re sembles the argillite already noticed, from which it differs only by its less solid and indurated state. It is formed by the decomposition of older rocks, and is fine or coarse, according to the size ofthe materials, sometimes even containing fragments or large nodules of rocks. The texture is shistose, divided by natural joints into beds. It seldom forms extensive tracts of country, be ing usually subordinate to more important and conspicuous formations. ,"], [241, "231 It occurs most frequently in very thin strata or lamin\u00e6, alternating with other rocks. It is as sociated with coal, alternating with it, and often impregnated with bitumen. It is found also with secondary limestone, forming thin strata, alterna ting with calcareous beds, or entering as a con stituent. Its resemblance to greywacke is sometimes so strong as to deceive, without an examination of the geological position. It often contains many vegetable impressions. The next rock we have to mention, is limestone ; called Magnesian Limestone, or Alpine limestone. It is a dull rock, of various colours, usually greyish, from white to black, which it derives from bitumen. Its texture is usually earthy \u2014 rarely crystalline. This rock is not found in all countries \u2014 on the continent of Europe it exists in great abundance, and takes the place of the rock I shall next men tion. On that continent it is the usual repository of gypsum and rock salt\u2014 two very important minerals. The term Alpine Limestone applied to this rock, is unfortunate, since it offers the idea that the Alps are formed of it: which is erro neous."], [242, "232 The rock salt found in this rock is also a'way associated with a certain clay, called Muriatife rous clay, which characterises the formation of rock salt, in both hemispheres, as the clay with impressions of fern, does that of coal. Rock salt is found minutely disseminated in this clay, or forming large masses \u2014 and this points out how it is to be worked \u2014 whether it is to be work ed or quarried \u2014 or whether the rock is to be washed by the repeated introduction of fresh wa ter, for the purpose of dissolving the salt, and thus bringing if out in solution. When the salt does not form true beds, it is often found interwo ven, as a net work, running through the clay At other times it exists in thin veins. On the eastern declivity of the Andes in a Peruvian province, the river Gualaga has cut its way through the skirt of a mountain of rock salt, which also contains an ore of lead. Indeed, lead, clay, gypsum, and limestone, are the usual accompaniments of rock salt. In Europe and in South America, rock salt is in many places quarried, and is open to day. Upon comparing the different localities of rock salt in England, at Bex, (Switzerland) on the Car pathian Mountains, of Hallein. of Hallstadt,ofSavoy, and of Halle in Tyrol, it has been noticed that the"], [243, "233 deposits of rock salt in Eurcpe, diminish in riches with their elevation above the sea. In South America, where alone on our continent, we have yet found rock salt, it occurs in immense beds, nearly 1 4,000 feet above the ocean : and only one mine, that of Huaura, in Peru, is richer. It is there worked in the same way as a quarry of marble. This limestone has its peculiar fossils, viz. gry phites, entrochites, terebratulites, pentacrinites, arc\u00e6, encrinites, ammonites, orthoceratites, bones of the monitor, impressions of lycopodiace\u00e6, and bambousace\u00e6 and leaves of dicotyledon plants, analogous to the willow. In countries where this rock does not exist, as in England, its place is occupied by another \u2014 viz. The Variegated Sandstone, or New Red Marle, which in that, and some other countries, is considered as the peculiar repository of rock salt. In most countries, the salt seems to have been de posited in basin shaped cavities, similar to those in which we often find coal. This is the case with the salt of Cheshire in England, where one bed of hard salt is 26 yards thick. At Cordova, in Spain, where one mass of salt is nearly 700 feet high,"], [244, "234 and more than 1200 feet broad, it is encompassed by this rock. The sandy deserts of Caramania in Asia afford rock salt so hard and dry that it is used as build ing stone. Where rock salt is not found, and springs sup ply its place, it is singular that they are always found in a line, or band, as it were : and usually at or near the base of some mountain chain. The most splendid and remarkable deposits of salt, are at the foot of the Carpathian mountains \u2014 the English mines are near its central chain, and we may draw a line on the west of our Alleganies, be yond which all our salt springs are found. Our own invaluable springs in ( Jnondago, Cayuga, Wayne, and the neighbouring counties are sources of wealth to our state, which are indeed inestimable. In 1800, when the brine of Onondago was sup posed to be rich, it afforded but 42,754 bushels\u2014 In 1814, nearly 300,000 bushels were manufactur ed \u2014 allowing the state a revenue of $7,000 \u2014 and in 1823, upwards of 6t.'0,000 bushels were made, and the state reaped a revenue of nearly $76,u00. In 1824, the tax amounted to nearly one million of dollars. From the town of Salina, above three millions of bushels might be made, should"], [245, "235 tlie demand require it, and the state would derive an income of $375,000 from the brines of one village. The importance ofthis article is yet to be dis covered by our citizens. The manufacturer and the agriculturalist are yet to be convinced of the benefits it can afford them : to the agriculturalist, in particular, it offers the means of improving his lands, of increasing his stock, and materially en larging his profits. The various uses of salt, its localities, the pla ces where it may be found, and the purposes to which it may be applied, have been some months before the public in an \" Essay on Salt,\" to which I may refer you. Reposing on the Magnesian Limestone or Varie gated Sandstone are various beds of lime, under the names of oolite, shell limestone, lias, and marie : and several beds of sand, under the names of fer ruginous sand, and green sand. The Secondary Limestone occupies an impor portant place in our country \u2014 and covers the im mense secondary region embracing the western parts of our state, extending north into Canada, to the primary ridge of mountains dividing the waters"], [246, "236 ofthe St. Lawrence from those of Hudson's Bay : and south to the Ohio. Shell Limestone (the Muschelkalk of the Ger man school; is usually the lowest ofthis class of limestone, and is ver) similar to the English Port land stone. It is characterised by the great abundance of broken shells pervading the mass. Humboldt supposes that it has an oolite for a geognostic equi valent. He mentions the following shells as be longing to it \u2014 belemnites, chamites, ammonites, nautilites, buccinites, trochites, turbinites, pecti nites, ostrocites, terebratulites, gryphites, mytu lites, pectacrinites, encrinites, &c. What has been usually termed the Jura Lime stone, is a succession of beds of lias, marl and oolite of which the former is the lowest. This unfortunate name was given to it by Humboldt. \u2014 It is also called the Cavern Limestone. In England this suite of formations is considered as very interesting, and occcupies the whole space between the variegated sandstone, or new red marie, and the chalk. It is there found to contain several sub-divisions or beds, each bearing a different name."], [247, "237 Lias reposes, in many places, on the new red marie; it is a blueish argillaceous mass, alterna ting with beds of limestone. These beds become thicker towards the lower part, white, and fit for lythographic purposes. The fossils of the lias are numerous and beautiful. The following list approaches to a perfect catalogue so far as we know, viz. \u2014 Ichthyosaurus, plesiosaurus, testudo, several species offish, ammonites, (about 20 spe cies) those having the siphuncle in an elevated ridge, between two furrows are characteristic of this formation.

The most characteristic shells of this formation are the ammonites, (bucklandi) the gryph\u0153a, (in curvata) and the plagiostama, (gigantea.) 32"], [248, "238 The Oolites or Roe Stones derive their name from the small particles embedded in the mass, \u25a0riving it an appearance similar to the roe of fishes. The principal building stone of England is from oolitic series. Oolite has lately been found in our country \u2014 Mr. Schoolcraft noticed it regularly stratafied, in the State of Illinois, as containing lead mines, in connection with shell limestone. A locality of it has been noticed in Saratoga county during the last summer. As yet no geologist has thoroughly examined this rock in situ in United States. The great mass of oolites in England has been sub-divided, into three distinct systems, each of which has been separately studied and found to be rich in organic remains. They are separated by beds of clay. The Lower System or Division of Oolites, consists of oolite mixed with sand, and fullers' earth, and embraces the great oolite, oolite of Stonesfield, cornbrash,forest marble, and Kelloway rock, of the English Geologists, and the shelly, and arenaceous limestones. The following are the contained fossils; Saurian animals, two or three species of testudo, several offish, two or three of insects, Crustacea! ammonites, nautilites, belemnites, trochus, voluta, turbo, turritella, rostellaria, ampullaria. natica"], [249, "239 ancella, planorbis, melania, helicina, serpula, modiola, unio, trigonia, cardium, cardita, mya, ve nus, lutralia, astarte, fistulana, mytilus, donax, tel lina, pinna, ostrea, pecten, avicula, lima, terebra tula, chama, plagiostoma, gryph\u0153a, perna, crena tula; echinus, encrinites, coralloids and alcyonia : also fossil wood and vegetable impressions. The Middle System or Division of Ooolite, embraces Oxford clay, (clunch clay) sand, calcareous con glomerates, (calcareous grit) coral rag, or lime stones with madrepores and echinites \u2014 and con tains the following fossils, viz. \u2014 bones of the ich thyosaurus, ammonites, nautilus, belemnites, me lania, turbo, helix, trochus rostellaria, patella, serpula, ostrea, pecten, cardita, chama, gry ph\u0153a, trigonia, lima, lithophaga, mytilus, modiola, avicula, plagiostoma, terebratula, echinus, cly peus, caryophillia, astrea, and fossil wood.

The ammonite triplicatus, and pecten lamellosus are most characteristic of the Portland oolite ; and the ostrea deltoidea of the Kimmeridge clay. The beds above the oolite are iron sand, green sand, and chalk marie, running into chalk, the last of the secondary rocks, approaching upwards. The Tron Sand Formation, is composed ofa se ries of strata of sand, and sandstone, occasionally alternating with small beds of clay, loam, marie, fullers' earth, and ochre. The sand and sandstone are siliceous, and coloured by oxide of iron \u2014 a metal existing in such quantity in this formation as often to render it worth working. This seems to spread extensively over the western parts of the state of New-York, and to be noticed by Mr. Ea ton,(in the survey of the district adjoining the Erie Canal, which Gen. Van Rensselaer employed him to take,) as the ferriferous sand rock. In England it is occasionally 1000 feet thick, and worked in many places for iron, the most abundant mineral of this rock."], [251, "241 The organic remains are not numerous : a nau tilus, fragments of ammonites, belemnites, ostre\u00e6, terebratul\u00e6, spines of the echinus, spongit\u00e6, and corallines. Green Sand is composed of Siliceous sand, loose, and united in form of sandstone, by a cal careous cement, and containing small particle- of green earth, whence is derived the name. The size of the grains varies from very small, forming a fine grained sandstone,to large, f rming a conglomerate rock. It is usually divided from the iron sand by a dark blueish clay, containing small specks of mica, with nodules of selenite and iron pyrites. The fossil contents are beautiful.

In the most ancient, the bones ofthe monitor, of sea turtles, and teeth and ver tebr\u00e6 of fishes are every where found. The chalk formation has not yet been discov ered in our country, and some deny its existence.

Volcanic rocks and Alluvia are of separate and distinct classes from each and all others. The tertiary formation is composed of different compounds, in which lime and sand and clay are the chief materials. It is but a few years since these strata have been separated from the alluvia.

It consists of strata of white limestone, and of grey, or compact, or granular limestone, penetra ted by silex, which, in different shapes, fills the cavities. It has no fossils. It seems to be only a part of the preceding rock. The gypsum formation, and the marine marl forma tion, are treated of together : being gypsum, and beds of clay marl and calcareous marl, in a regu lar succession, when all are present. The gyp sum constitutes the greatest mass, occurring in longish or conical bodies, and not in extensive fields. Montmatre, in Paris, is an example, and there three beds are placed over each other. The first, contains alternate layers of gypsum, cal careous marl,and argillaceous marl: sea shells are found in it \u2014 as are fresh water shells in the white marl. The second has more beds of marl than the first,and contains sulphat of strontian and fos sil fishes. The third is the most extensive, and contains many beds of marl. The quarries in this upper gypsum afford those remarkable skele tons and bones of unknown birds and quadrupeds. The following fossils are found in these united formations. Pal\u00e6otherium, magnum, medium."], [262, "252 crassum, curtum, and minus. Anaplotherium, commune, secundarium, medium, minus, minimum. A pachidermatous animal allied to the hog Ca nis parisiensis. Three or four species of birds. Trionix parisiensis, and another tortoise. A sau rian animal, allied to the crocodile. Three or four species of fishes. Cyclostoma,limneus,planor bis, spirorbis, cerithium, itytherium, ampullaria, cardium, nucula, ostrea, cancer. Sandstone and Sand without shells rests on those already described, in strata of considerable thick ness. The Upper Marine Sandstone and Sand varies in composition, and color, and compactness, being a greyish, or red sandstone, sometimes argillaceous, sometimes calcareous. This sandstone contains fossils differing from those found in the sandstone formerly mentioned, viz. olivia, cerithium, pectun culus, crassatella, donax, citherea, corbula, ostrea, melania ? fusus ? Millstone without shells embraces millstones, sand, iron shot, and a clay marl, greenish, reddish, or whitish. It seems to be only a portion of the sol- Wing division. The millstone is a quartz with"], [263, "253 many irregular cavities, traversed by reticulated siliceous fibres, and sometimes filled with ochre, clay or marl. There are no organic remains in the millstone. The Flint and Siliceous Limestone formation con sists of these two substances, independent of each other, or intimately united. The limestone most common is nearly pure, often embracing flint, of which however large masses are rare. The limestone is white or yellowish, and whatever may be its original hardness, it softens by exposure, and forms a manure for the agriculturalist. The essential character ofthe formation is the contained multitude of fresh water and land shells, nearly all ofwhich belong to genera now inhabiting moras ses ; but no marine shells, except when in imme diate contact with the marine formation. The fol lowing belong particularly to the upper fresh wa ter formation, t'yclostoma, potamides, planorbis limneus, bulimus, pupa, helix, dycotyledons sili cified, arundo. No bivalve occurs among the number. It has been justly observed that the Plastic clay, limestone, gypsum, sandstone, and flint and silice ous sandstone, seem well characterised ; and that 34"], [264, "254 the terms fresh water and salt water formations might perhaps be supplied by more appropriate names. The hypothesis whence these names are derived seems supported by the organic remains ofthe strata. Of th e Tertiary Formations in England we have an elaborate description by Messrs Conybeare and Phillips. They name four, viz. the Plastic sand and clay, resting upon which is the London clay, and over this the fresh water formation, and the upper marine formation. The Plastic Clay is formed of an indefinite num ber of beds of sand, clay and gravel, alternating without order. Mr. Webster remarked the simi larity of this formation to that of Paris. The sand of Alum Bay, in the Isle of V\\ ight, exhibits every variety of color. The clay is laminated, and of va rious colors and purity, offering the several kinds of clay for the arts. There are few minerals : iron pyrites, selenite, gypsum, and a few spangles of mica. The organic remains are not numerous nor regular, being found indiscriminately in the clay, sand, and pebbles. The following are the usually contained fossils, murex, infundibulum."], [265, "255 cerithium, turritella, planorbis, astrea, pectunculus, mya, cytherea, cyclas. The London clay is so called from its forming the substratum of London and its environs. It is a tough, bluish or blackish clay, varying in its char acters ; some strata partaking of the nature of marl. The lower parts frequently run into a siliceous sandstone. It may be stated to be an extensive, argillace ous deposit, embracing subordinate calcareous beds, occasionally passing into solid rocks, or va ried in aspect by an accidental mixture of sand and calcareous matter with the clay. In its relations and fossils this is supposed to approximate nearly to the calcaire grossier of Paris. It contains iron pyrites, amber, selenite, and lignite with the woody fibre. The fossils are interesting and numerous. The crocodile and the turtle, and several species of fish are found. Zoopytes are rare. The vegetable remains are numerous and beautiful. In the island of Sheppey alone upwards of 700 varieties of fos sil fruit have been observed. The following shells are mentioned viz : ammonites, nautilites, nuinmulites, seraphs, cyprea, conus, terebellum."], [266, "256 auricula, voluta, oliva, ancilla, buccinum, melania, cassis, murex, pleurotoma, fusus, rostellaria* st ombus, cerithium. infundibulum, trochus, sola rium, turritella. turbo, scalaria, ampullaria, vivipa ra. natica, ostrea, pecten, pectunculus, avicula, modiola, nucula, area, chama, mya, lingula, sol en, cardium, cardita, isocardia, venericardia, venus, corbula, serpula, dentalium, teredo. The fresh water formation, in general terms, con sist of marie, argillaceous limestone, and sand3 crossed by calcareous spar. It contains no gyp sum, which is so plentiful and abundant in re mains, in the French corresponding beds. This formation has been seperated into the upper and lower divisions. The latter consists in a series of beds of sandy, argillaceous, and calcareous marls, containing a coaly matter. Some of them seem to be wholly composed of comminuted fresh water shells, con tainining some that are entire, among them are the lymneus, planorbis and cyclostoma, helix ? and my tilus ? The upper division is an extensive calcareous bed, of yellowish white marl, that is soft, but in cludes harder and more durable masses. It con taint veins of cabonat of lime-The organic contents"], [267, "257 are sound in all parts of the bed, and consist ex- clusively of fresh water shells, as lymneus, planor- bis, helix. Some seeds are found, and parts of coleopterous insects. The other shells found in the entire formation are potamides, paludina, melanopsis, phasianel la ? ampullaria, unio. The upper marine formation is composed of sandy and gravelly deposits enclosing fresh water shells, and sometimes embracing beds of shell marie. \u2014 The sand is sometimes ferruginous, and cemented. It resembles the corresponding formation of France. It contains no minerals. The following fossil are mentioned. A large tooth, fragments of bones, spongia, alcyonia. Most of the shells are recent. Patella, emarginula, calyptrea, buc cinum, murex, cassis, natica, turbo, cyprea, scal laria, turritella, vivipara, voluta, trochus, infundi bulum, mya, unio, lingula, mytilus cardium, venericardia, venus, area, astarte, mactra, solen tellina, nucula, balanus, pholas, dentalium. Of the Tertiary Formations in the United States, the most extensive is the Plastic Clay, exhibiting its brilliant clays and sands, with its beds of peb-"], [268, "258 bles, and its lignite. At Martha's Vineyard, where it has been examined by Mr. Hitchcock, it presents cliff 200 feet in height, composed of an irregular succession of beds of clay, sand and pebbles, with lignite. The clays are white, brown, blackish, red and yellowish of many shades. The sand too has various colors. The pebbles have a ferrugin ous coat \u2014 The lignite is well characterised. There occur small plates of silvery mica, and a small and occasional quantity of amber. The subtratum is not known. On Long Island this formation is well marked, and there is scarcely a man on the island but knows that at the depth of from 15 to 60 feet char red wood, with perriwinkle and other shells are sound in beds of clay, sand, and gravel. Large quantites of clays are annually sent from Amboy, (New Jersey.) and their use in manufac tures is well known. The whole triangle formed by the Ocean and the Delaware and Raritan rivers is composed of sand, clay and gravel, alternating, and occasionally consolidated by a ferruginous ce ment. It contains lignite and shells. The banks' ofthe Delaware river, for several miles, are com posed of brilliant sands, with beds of clay and lig nite : the clay is white, yellow and blue, with shades. This formation extends southward, skirt-"], [269, "259 ing the Atlantic through our southern states. It has been examined at various points, and presents the same characters at Martha's Vineyard, Long Island, Staten Island, New Jersey, near Philadelphia, at Cape Sable, and in Florida. Its similarity to the English and French Plastic clay is acknowledged now by all those who have kept pace with the rapid strides of Geology for the few last years, and who are willing to ex amine facts without reference to theories. The fol lowing fossils have been found. Murex, venus, car dium pectunculus. ostrea, area, pecten, donax. \u2014 - teeth of sharks, crocodiles, and cetacea. The London Clay, or a corresponding formation has been supposed to exist at Washington, and to form the general substratum of the city. It was noticed and mentioned several years ago, as a mud dy clay, containing occasional pebbles and shells \u2014 with trunks and branches of trees resembling coal, and with iron pyrites. The teeth of sharks and a large rib were many, years ago taken from the clay. Mr. Finch has compared it to the forma tion of Highgate near London. The coarse marine limestone (calcaire grossier) and the siliceous limestone (calcaire silicieuse) seem, to"], [270, "\u25a0__60 exist in Georgia, judging from the millstone or buhr stone sent from that state. In some parts of this formation are cavities are filled with stalactites or incrustations \u2014 in other places it abounds in shells, among them mactra and tellina have been obser ed, with madrepores and a pectunculus. Horn stone and quartz are found imbedded. The calcaire grossier has been observed by Humboldt in So- America, and there contains ostre\u00e6, madrepores and turbinites. In New Jersey are several localities of a clay nearly filled with shells \u2014 or perhaps more correct- ly of large masses of shells with clay. They rest on gravel beds ; and are used as manures, under the name of marl. These beds are immediately under the soil, and afford the remains of the mastodon, the crocodile, the shark, the monitor and cetacea : pectens, terebratul\u00e6. donax, area, turbinolia, ros- tellaria, ammonites, pyrula ; also lignite and amber. Similar localities exist in the counties of Orange and Ulster where bones ofthe Mastodon have been found : the pecten, ostrea, venus, planorbis, helix) and voluta. This seems to correspond with what is termed by the English Geologists, the upper fresh water formation."], [271, "261 An interesting account of these formations will doubtless soon be published by those who have had more extensive opportunities and leisure to examine them. From a collection <>f shells lately made in YJaryland, the following have been de scribed inthe Journal ofthe Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia. Turritella, natica, oliva, buccinum, fusis, fulgur, calyptr\u0153a, dispotoa. fissurella, ostrea, pecten, plicatula, area, pec tunculus, nucula, venericardia, crassatella, iso cardia, tellina, lucina, venus, cytherea, astarte. mactra, amphiderma, corbula, panop\u0153a, ser pula, dentalium. In Europe the isocardia has, I believe, been found only in the London clay ; and the astarte in the upper marine formation : should these be considered as characterestic, this collec tion of fossils would indicate their positions to have been the Plastic clay, London clay, and upper marine formations. The siliceous sand of the upper marine forma tion, shifting with every wind that blows, is seen on many parts of Long Isiand, in New Jersey, Vir ginia and the Carolinas. In fine, the whole tract of country, with few and small exceptions, between the Allegany ridge and the ocean is of tertiary formation. Commencing, certainly as far north as Martha's Vineyard, per- 35"], [272, "262 haps even embracing the gypsum and sand of Nova Scotia, it extends through Long Island, and New Jersey, and stretching through our Atlantic States, forms a class corresponding in size with our gigan tic primary and secondary. Some certain rocks are usually referred to a peculiar class, under the term superincumbent or overlying rocks. They are unstratafied, and pos terior to the rocks in connection with which they are found. They pass almost imperceptibly into each other, with a kw exceptions that scarce de serve notice. It may be said that they occur as re cent secondary rocks ; some of them are of older origin, but there are no unexceptionable rules for distinguishing them, and it is perhaps best to class them together. This is the more necessary as neither composition nor position authorize the dis tinction of separate families. The rocks of this division occur in more or less extensive localities; and are by some considered as independent formations. While other geologists suppose them universal, as they are found forming tracts in all countries. They are observed in contact with every rock from granite to the most recent secondary. We do"], [273, "263 not know if they ever rest on the tertiary ; they have not been noticed in that position. In granite they occur in veins. In the stratified rocks of both primary and secondary classes they appear as masses also, and sometimes even as beds It is said that in the Isle of Skye they form strata parallel, and not connected with veins, but alternating with jasper, siliceous schist, and fer ruginous clay. These rocks sometimes constitute mountains, or hills ; and sometimes form the summits merely. Mount Holyoke, Mount Tom, East and West Moun tains, near New Haven \u2014 and the superb Pahsa does on the Hudson river are familiar examples. They sometimes resemble granite, being dispos ed in beds, and divided into cuboidal masses, which occasionally become rounded by the weather, in the same way as that rock. They are sometimes also prismatic and columnar; of which the Island of Staffa, and the Giant's Causeway are among the most splendid examples. The columns may be regular, and in contact : or they may be irregular in the same bed : some times they are so confused as to resemble a mere heap of broken columns. In many instances the prisms are straight, and in contact, thus bestowing a beautiful architectural appearance ; as in Fin-"], [274, "264 </al's Cave. In some instances the prisms are bent, in one or more directions. The form of the columns varies from three the twelve sides\u2014 which are often so placed as to pre sent an absolute whole, marked by lines. This structure occurs in all the members ofthe family\u2014 not in basalt only, as is frequently supposed, but in sienite, claystone and greenstone. The laminar structure occurs in this family : the lamin\u00e6 varying from the thickness of paper to very large. This structure is found in all varieties of these rocks. The lamin\u00e6 are parallel, or transverse to the columns, when combined with the columnar structure. There is a peculiar internal structure in these rocks, exhibited by decomposition. It is often the case that a column or joint wastes away, so as to show, by successive exfoliation, a spheroidal figure.. Sometimes, some of those varieties having a base of indurated clay, become changed, by dis integration to some depth, and are so soft as, by many, to be mistaken for clays. The cavernous, amygdaloidal and porphyritic structures, are also seen in these rocks. The cavernous is similar to the variety occur-"], [275, "265 ring in some lavas\u2014 the cells being elongated, or contorted, and coated with a vitreous varnish. Occasionally the cells contain those substances that are found in the amygdaloids ; thus these two structures sometimes pass into each other, some times into the porphyritic. There are so many rocks in this class that we cannot give any general rules as to texture or com position. Indurated clay is the chief substance in this family, passing into claystone, clinkstone and fel spar : the extremes of this series are essential in gredients. Of the less frequent constituents, horn blende is the most common \u2014 varying in quantity and in the size ofthe crystals. In sienite, hornblende forms a small share ofthe rock and is sometimes crystallised. In greenstone it is very minute and confused : when it is very abun dant, and minutely divided, the rock passes into ba salt. When most excessive and fine, the basalt is well marked : but there are great differences of as pect. When the base of compact felspar or clink stone becomes very dark, and the hornblende near ly disappears, the mass passes into clinkstone : and thus many dark clinkstones are termed basalt : thus accounting for the endless variety of basalt? mentioned by authors."], [276, "266 The presence of hornblende thus constitutes the series of sienite, greenstone and basalt, also called trap rocks, of the superincumbent class. But there are no characters for distinguishing in variably the two latter. In each the base is clay stone, clinkstone, or compact felspar, united by hornblende, and exhibiting a similar structure. The distinctive character chiefly relied on at pre sent is color: those rocks in whieh the constituents are pale whitish, yellowish, or reddish, being sien ite : and those in which they are grey greenish, or dark colored, being greenstone. Dr. Macculloch proposes that instead of color the quantity of the ingredients be taken as a guide : the excess ofthe three minerals abovementioned to constitute sien ite ; and those compounds into which hornblende enters in equal or greater proportion to be named greenstone. But even in this case there will often be doubt as to the nature of some rocks. Another mineral often forming an ingredient in this class, is augit, which is supposed to have been often mistaken for hornblende. It occurs in the same manner as that mineral, usually of a dark green or black color. It is sometimes sparingly present, and then the compound resembles sien ite : at others it so finely divided that the rock"], [277, "267 seems homogeneous, and can scarcely be distin guished from basalt. It has been proposed to give to such rocks the compound name of augitic sienite, augitic greenstone, and augitic basalt. Hypersthene is also mentioned as an ingredient, often compounded with hornblende, of which it is a species. Felspar is an ingredient in the porphyries, and gives to this rock its peculiar character : but it oc curs also in sienite and greenstone without attaching to them the porphyritic structure. In these cases the structure is granitic. Occasionally the felspar is ofthe glassy variety, sometimes crystallised, at others simply occupying the place of common felspar. Mica is rarely sound in porphyries : still rarer in greenstone. Quartz too is found in greenstone and porphyry \u2014 in the same w.y that it occurs in granite, from which these compounds are some times difficult to be distinguished. The minerals found in these rocks are mesotype, prehnite, stilbite, epidote, calcareous spar, and a very few others occasionally. For a more full account of the sub-divisons, I refer to the synopsis of these rocks at the close of the volume. As much difficulty has arisen in dis-"], [278, "268 tinguishing the members of this class, I have deemed it adviseable to give the synopsis of Dr. Macculloch with slight omissions, as it may aid enquirers in their researches on this class. The history and formation of Alluvial De posits is extremely interesting. 1 have already slightly noticed them. They occur in various sit uations, bespeaking different origins. When found in vallies, through which rivers run, they usually arise from the abrasion of the chan nels in which these flow : and particularly from hills whence their sources are derived. They arise from the same cause when they form exten sive plains, accompanying the estuaries of rivers: or when filling lakes : we often see these in the interior of countries where the lakes have been gradually filled with alluvial, and dried up The waters of some rivers and lakes hold lime in solution, which is gradually deposited\u2014 this is the well known Travertino of Rome ; and per haps the stalagmitic rocks of Gibraltar and else where. On sea shores the waves cast up loose materials formed of sand and fragments of shells, on which"], [279, "269 plants grow and add a soil towards the completion of a bank, that eventually rises far above the water. At the foot of mountain alluvial is formed by the daily waste of the materials, urged solely by the force of gravity, and the ordinary drainage of the surface. Occasionally rocks are entirely decomposed in situ. The mass of constituents thus crumbled to gether, lie loose \u2014 and are mostly formed of gra nite, gneiss, or red sandstone. Thus we have announced four kinds of alluvia. viz. that of rivers and estuaries, marine alluvia, alluvia of descent, and untransported alluvia. \u2014 Their extent, depth and form are various. A dis tinct stratafication is often observed. The parti cles are of all sizes, sometimes fine as sand, and sometimes many cubic feet. If they are round or angular depends on the distance they have been transported, and on the time and degree they have been exposed to the several causes of waste, and on the nature ofthe materials. I have mentioned before, that they often con tain minerals, of which tin, gold, and diamonds are the moBt remarkable. 36"], [280, "270 From the partial alluvia, which we can trace and account for, we must separate the Diluvia, found in places where none of the cause abovementioned could have acted, and which owe their origin, in some- cases, to partial and temporary floods ; in others to that great and eventful deluge described by Moses, with whose account, as we have seen in a former lecture, so strongly coincide the dicover ies of geology, which has thus rendered an unex pected and important, though unneeded, support to the Sacred History. We have thus surveyed, with a cursory glance, the different geological theories accounting for the present appearance of our globe. \u2014 We have seen that they all refer to that general deluge which forms so conspicuous an epoch in the history of our planet. We have observed that the great waters covered our earth \u2014 and have noticed its gradual subsidence, or the elevation of the land. We have seen the retiring waters forming vallies \u2014 have fol lowed the divisions of land \u2014 and examined the Alpine district of mountains, the lowland plains. and the bottom ofthe sea. We have also examined, at least mentioned, all known rocks\u2014 from the primary, formed before the"], [281, "271 existence of animal or vegetable organization, to the secondary, which contain the organic remains of generations passed away, and which have been termed the medals of nature : \u2014 to the tertiary which was last produced, and the alluvia that is daily deposited at the present. We have also noticed the causes now operating, and changing the surface of our planet, viz. the action ofthe elements, water more particularly, and the formation of peat and of coral reefs, and have examined the agency of volcanoes and earth quakes. And in so doing, have superficially tra ced the outlines of geological science. The de scription and history of the various mineral con tents of rocks do not come within my duties, but belong to mineralogy. Should I be asked for a book of reference con taining the elements of geology, I must answer that I know of no work that is fit for a beginner in the study. Humboldt, Macculloch, Conybeare and Phillips, and Bakewell, all presuppose too much\u2014 and are calculated for the perusal of geologists, rather than students. Their works however may be advantageously consulted. The various periodicals ofthe United States contain more or less informa tion on this subject\u2014 among others I cannot refrain from noticing a little and unpretending pamphlet"], [282, "272 occasionally published. \" The Annals of the Ly ceum of Natural History, of New-York,\" a so ciety that is actively and honorably engaged in ex amining and elucidating the natural history of our country. Nor can I omit to mention the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadel phia : Nor the American Journal of Science, so ably conducted by Prof. Silliman. I am as sensible as any of you can be of the de ficiencies and imperfections of this course : but I make no apology, conscious of your being all aware, that no subject, no scientific subject, can be properly treated of and condensed into four or six lectures. We might have passed our hours with more amusement, but then we must necessarily have de parted from the dry detail of this science. I regret that more time was not allowed to en large upon and illustrate the real value and utility ofthis science. And if in my Lectures I have failed to render the study of Geology interesting, I have the candor to acknowledge, and sincerely wish you all to believe, that the fault lies not in the subject, but in the person who has the honor to address you."], [283, ""], [284, "To facilitate the study of Geology, a Synopsis of each individual Rock is here added, affording a view of the different compounds that may be classed respectively under each head.
