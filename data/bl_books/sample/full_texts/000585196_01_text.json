Within the last decade America has made marvelous developments in her iron industry, until now she leads the world in the quantity of her products, and bows to none in their quality. The relative position of the great industrial nations will be evident from a glance at Table 1. Table 1. Average Yearly Production of Pig-Iron and Steel by the Leading Four Nations. Figures are in metric tons and are taken from Vol. IV of The Mineral Industry. Period. United States. Great Britain. Germany. France. This wonderful progress has not been the unearned harvest of bounteous nature, for it has been accomplished in defiance of mighty obstacles in the enormous distances through which the raw materials must be carried, and, although the achievement may be a just source of national pride, it involves inevitable expenses and disadvantages which may be lessened by energy, but which can never be swept awaj*. The progress in quantity of product has been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in the quality, due in great measure to the requirements of the engineering profession. The present generation has discarded the use of wrought-iron in general construction, and it is now used only by those engi neers who are a legacy of an ancient regime and who refuse to Pig-iron.

This is essentially the age of steel, and, while a few of the following pages are devoted to the making of wrought-iron, their end and aim is to describe in concise form, for the use of constructive engineers, the manufacture and the nature of the newer material. As having an important bearing upon the question, it has been thought best to devote much space to those processes by which most of the iron products of commerce are made. These chapters on purely metallurgical subjects can not pretend to be complete, but they aim to present the main features, and to show that the makers of steel are doing what they can to discover the laws that govern their art. In other chapters are recorded some investigations upon the physical qualities of steel. It would be too much to expect that any such limited series of tests could forever settle all disputed points, but it is hoped that the work is on the right road in the effort to have all experiments conducted under constant conditions, in order that the variable determinants shall be reduced to the smallest possible number. In many places I have cited the opinions and experiments of leading metallurgists, especial prominence being given to the researches of H. M. Howe and R. A. Hadfield. In all instances, reference is made to the source of information. This rule is not followed in the case of my own writings, so that it may be well to state that the chapters relating to open hearth practice and to fuel have been condensed from certain papers of mine, which may be consulted by those desiring fuller information in the Transactions of the American Insti tute of Mining Engineers, Vol. XIX, pp. 128 to 187, Vol. XX, pp. 227 to 232, and Vol. XXII, pp. 345 to 511, and 679 to 696. Portions of chapters XVI, XVII, and XVIII, have very recently appeared in the Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, April, 1895, but in this case the present book is an amplification rather than a condensation, of the paper. No attempt is made to prove any novel metallurgical theory, nor is there any argument, in the chapters on structural steel, in favor of relieving manufacturers from furnishing the best material. On the contrary, the recommendations are in the line of greater stringency, since the true pride of the manu-"], [13, "INTRODUCTION. VII facturer should be the elevation of the standard above the reach of his less skilled competitors. The experiments and investigations, except where otherwise stated, have been con ducted at the works of The Pennsylvania Steel Company at Steelton, Pa., and all the details of manufacture and treat ment have been under my direct observation.

Section 1. \u2014 Examples of errors in metallurgical publica tions. \u2014 We have all heard much of the higher criticism in connection with the historical writings of antiquity, but it will seem strange to many if I urge the application of this highest of all arts to the one field where exactness and clear reason are supposed to reign supreme. A scientific statement of a definite determination is usually assumed to be correct, save by a certain unimportant experimental error. Unfortunately, this child-like faith is too often misplaced, and the careful student builds his theories on the errors of ignorance and carelessness. A notable instance of this may be found in our own special field of metallurgy. The foremost book on iron and steel in our language is the massive volume by H. M. Howe, entitled, \"The Metallurgy of Steel.\" The author of this great work has carefully searched the records of the scientific societies of the world, and has given us all the available data to be found bearing upon the problems of steel manufacture. In the quest for general laws from laboriously constructed tables, and in the discussion of erudite matters of theory, he has"], [30, "2 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. been guided by a keen acumen which has placed many of his generalizations above dispute. And yet, occasionally, in the compilation of some of the tables, there is a most unfortunate readiness to accept the most glaring absurdities. An illustration of this may be found on page IS of \" The Metallurgy,\" in the table showing the effect of hardening upon various iron compounds. Test No. 11 is a Bessemer steel with .33 per cent, carbon, 51259 pounds ultimate strength after annealing, and 19 per cent, elongation. This is, indeed, a strange metal, and the internal evidence of error should have caused the record to be thrown out. The mistake is not in the types, for it is gravely recorded that the strength of the origi nal bar was 37 per cent, higher, or 70*225 pounds per square inch. Now, if the annealed bar gave 51259 pounds ultimate strength, and the natural bar 70225 pounds, it is evident that the piece must have been cold-rolled, or otherwise specially treated, and therefore entirely unlit for comparison with normal steel. But if we suppose that the figure 51259 is an error, then the extraordinary character of the metal disappears; for, with .33 carbon, an ultimate of 70,000 pounds would not be abnormal, and 19 per cent, elongation would lie quite in order, particu larly as the length of the test-piece is not given. With this change, however, the figures relating to hardening become worthless. The next line of the before mentioned table gives the tests on a steel of 82000 pounds ultimate strength. This is marked \" homogeneous metal,\" and the carbon is given as .4-0 per cent., this figure being followed by a question mark. It is difficult to understand why the carbon determination is doubted, for the analysis and the tensile strength correspond quite well. But whatever may have been the practice in the days gone by, it is certain that the meaningless epithet of \" homogeneous metal\" is not and never was applicable to a steel of .40 carbon. This absurdity of nomenclature is quite cast in the shade, however, by the astonishing classification, by the same experi menter, of metal showing over 100,000 pounds ultimate strength as \" rivet steel.\" Mr. Howe has kindly put an in terrogation mark after the figure showing 1.00 per cent."], [31, "THE ERRANCY OF SCIENTIFIC RECORDS. 3 carbon, but whether the question concerns the \" cast steel\" or the \" Bessemer steel\", or this remarkable \" rivet steel,\" he omits to mention. In the above illustration of the errancy of the printed page, I have selected Mr. Howe as my target, not because he is the most flagrant offender, but because he is the most eminent ; because his book is used by us all as an authority, and its responsibility must be measured by its fame. Sec 2. \u2014 Variations in the results of experiments due to the accumulation of petty errors. \u2014 Errors like the foregoing arise from different causes. They may come from mixing of test-pieces in the shop, the testing-room, and the labor atory, or from miscalculations and mistakes in measuring and copying the figures. Instances of such blunders can be found in every establishment, and the only true remedy is the repetition of the entire work. Even when the utmost care has been exercised, the results must not be translated too liter ally, for there are variations which are due solely to the cumulative effect of petty determinative errors. Thus, I made the experiment of cutting six tests from- the same bar and having them measured, pulled and calculated by the same man. The original piece was a rolled flat, 4 inches wide by 5-16 inch thick. This was cut lengthwise into two strips, \\\\ inches wide by 5-16 inch thick, and these strips were again cut into 18-inch lengths. Six of these, taken from alternate sides of the original bar throughout its length, were tested without treatment. The results are given in Table 2. Whether the determinations of sulphur and phosphorus are absolutely correct is of no importance, for it is certain that the total amount of impurity is very small, and the probable variation in chemical composition in different parts of such a bar may be neglected. In regard to the physical condition, it should be said that the piece was made from a billet, which in turn had been rolled from a 2-ton ingot ; the bar was there fore more uniform throughout than any two different bars would likely be ; and yet we find a variation of 1400 pounds in ultimate strength ; 3030 pounds in elastic limit ; 9.5 per cent, in elongation ; 3.20 per cent, in reduction of area, and 4.54 per cent, in elastic ratio."], [32, "4 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. Pourcel,* citing from one of my own papers, gives results differing but little more than this to prove the non-homo geneity of steel as produced by segregation ; by a strange irony of fate, he takes the records which I had confidently published to show that our steel was homogeneous and uniform. Nothing will better indicate the effect of a preconceived thesis upon the reasoning faculty. Table 2. Variations in Physical Properties of Pieces of the Same Rolled Bar. Size os bar, 1J4\"x5-18\".

Sec 3. \u2014 Errors in chemical methods. \u2014 Aside from the dis- turbing factors in the shop and testing-room, there are great and important errors in the work of the chemical laboratories. This will seem a reckless statement to those not conversant with the limitations of chemical science. The average chemist is well grounded in the belief that his determination of carbon by combustion is absolutely beyond question, and if some other chemist disagrees with him, it is the misfortune of that analyst. Not only is he quite certain of this result, but he regards his color determinations as above all but captious criticism. Such is the position of many a steel-works chemist, and the metallurgical compiler must accept his records as inerrant. It seems pertinent, therefore, to recite the following : * Segregation and its Consequences in Ingots of Steel and Iron. Trans. A. I. M. E.

In 1888 the chemical societies of the world arranged among themselves to investigate the methods of steel analysis. At one of the first meetings of the American committee it was found that the different ways of determining carbon did not give concordant results, and a special investigation was insti tuted to discover the causes of error. The result may be told by quoting the report of Prof. Langley,* one of the committee : \" It is perhaps not too much to say that sufficient work has already been done to throw doubt on the accuracy of all recent determinations made with preliminary solution of the steel in double chloride of copper and ammonium.\" This opinion has been reiterated in Vol. XX, p. 242, where it is stated that all commercial chlorides of copper and ammo nium contain carbon, and that their use in steel analysis gives too high a carbon percentages Table 3. Variations in the Results obtained by Different National Committees on the Same Steel. Since these reports have been published, the committees have been at work, and in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. XV, No. 8, is given a partial report of progress, while in The Chemical News, Vol. LXVII, No. 1766, further results are published. Table 3 shows a condensation of the records thus far made public. * International Standards for the Analysis of Iron and Steel. Trans. A. I. M.

It must be borne in mind that these analyses were con ducted under the most favorable conditions which could pos sibly exist. The chemists were men of recognized and emi nent ability, especially selected as worthy of their important task. Each fully understood that his reputation depended upon his report. He must agree with his co-workers or, if differing, must establish to the satisfaction of the world that bis methods were right, or else that there was some disturbing factor previously unknown to the chemical world. He was not confined to any one determination, but could repeat as often as desired, and compare with the work of assistants until the record stood for his highest accuracy. Not content with assuming ordinary risks, many blank determinations could be carried through to make sure of the quality of the reagents ; of the effect of varying moisture in the atmosphere ; and the many minor conditions that influence solution, pre cipitation and absorption. With all these abnormal refinements, the carbon determin ations vary in one standard from .45 to .50 and in another from .15' to .18. The other elements also show variations, and it must not be forgotten that these results are not separate and extreme instances, but that each is the average of many results and of several chemists. A table of extremes of separ ate determinations would be most interesting reading. Even with the above records we are justified in doubting any chem ical determination. Many records are published on the verbal statements of uneducated metallurgists, whose uncertain memory of facts not originally proven, is befogged by crochety prejudices. Some are taken from laboratory notebooks with too little care in the detection of clerical errors. Others are the results of methods which have been condemned by all chemists save the one using them, while still more have been obtained by methods which, though looked upon as correct at the time the analyses were made, have been found to be inad missible. Few, very few, have been made by chemists whose work is being continually checked by the parallel results of other analysts of known excellence. Even were this last re quirement met, it has been shown that scientific certainty would by no means be obtained. From the foregoing remarks it may be seen that the com-"], [35, "7 THE ERRANCY OF SCIENTIFIC RECORDS. parison of miscellaneous records is perfectly useless and mis leading. Even the results of two different well-conducted laboratories and works may not be trustingly placed together. This can be done if the two works in question exchange samples, and find that both obtain similar results from the same metals, but under no other circumstances is the comparison valid. Sec 4. \u2014 Necessity of uniformity in chemical work. \u2014 It may appear that these conclusions put in question the value of chemical work, but such is not the case. The one thing de sired above all others in practical manufacture is consistency of results, and, having this quality, the absoluteness may be dispensed with. A striking example of this happened in my own experience. We discovered many years ago that we had been running with an error of .11 per cent, in all our low car bon determinations, and .13 in all the high steels. Thus steel of .09 carbon had been regularly determined as .20, and .50 carbon as .63. Customers ordered steel, found it right, or found it too hard or too soft, and ordered the next lot accord ingly. Years had rolled by and every customer knew just what he wanted, and could learnedly discuss the special nature of .64 and of .76 carbon. The discovery of the error in the standards was a rude shock, and the change to the new order of things was the work of many months, and a diplomatic catering to prejudice, mixed with a very strong disinclination to an open acknowledgment that we had been altogether wrong. In these later days it is customary to have the standards analyzed by several chemists, and to take an average between results, which always differ. It has also been found essential, whenever color comparisons are to be made, that a standard of nearly the same composition be dissolved at the same time and under the same conditions as the steel under treatment. This refinement was certainly not observed in many analyses of the past. As before noted, the errancy of the records is not confined to the carbon, for sulphur is another offender. Three of the samples have only a trace at best, and hence a difference of 100 per cent, will not be discussed. But the results on the fourth sample, showing .038 by one average and .048 by an-"], [36, "8 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. other, is a more important matter. When United States Government contracts specify that sulphur must be below .04, and when steel is rejected because it shows .042 by the an alysis of a naval engineer, it is time that the standard methods should not give a variation such as these records show. The differences in silicon are unimportant, and the same may be said of manganese, although these determinations do not shed lustre on chemical science. It is in phosphorus that the most astonishing revelation appears. An error of 50 per cent, in steels of about .02 is bad enough, for contracts are made with that point as a limit, but the fourth sample is a catastrophe. In the structural world the limit .10 is looked upon as the maximum percentage admissible. Some few engineers, who desire a better class of material, specify that .08 shall be the maximum. Yet so great are the errors of the highest chemical research, that this sample (No. 4) is condemned by one committee as unfit for the most common work, while another approves it as of extra quality. Sec 5. \u2014 Variations in the parallel determinations of prac ticing chemists. \u2014 It may be a fall in dignity to leave these determinations of the picked chemists of the world and discuss the results of everyday work, but it is assuredly of vital importance to know how much reliance can be placed upon commercial records. At the Virginia Beach meeting of the A. I. M. E., in February, 1894, W. R. Webster recounted an investigation by Mr. Vauclain of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, wherein two pieces of boiler plate were each cut into five parts and sent to five different steel works for analysis. The greatest differences in the results were as follows : Carbon 0.17 to 0.23 per cent. Manganese 0.33 to 0.42 \" \" Phosphorus 0.041 to 0.055 \" \" Sulphur 0.019 to 0.043 \" \" In commenting upon these figures, the opinion was expressed by Mr. Vauclain that the divergence was probably due more to irregularity of the steel than to chemical errors. It should be noted, therefore, that both plates had been rolled direct from small ingots."], [37, "THE ERRANCY OF SCIENTIFIC RECORDS. 9 Inasmuch as the value of many investigations in this book depend on the accuracy of chemical determinations, Table 4 will be of interest as comparing the results obtained in the laboratory of the Pennsylvania Steel Company with those of the Pottstown Iron Company. The latter works is chosen on account of the investigations conducted there by AV. R.Webster into the physical properties of steel. His work is discussed at length in Chapter XVII, Part II. Table 4. Comparison of Chemical Results obtained on the same Steels by the Pottstown Iron Co. and the Pennsylvania Steel Co. Note.\u2014 i \u25a0Steels were made by the Pottstown Iron Co. It will be seen that there is a difference of one point in carbon between the determinations by color and by combus tion. This, usually, is of no importance, but in carefully equating the influence of elements, such a difference is of some moment. The manganese agrees very well, being suffi ciently accurate for all practical purposes. The two averages of phosphorus coincide, but the individual records show that this is purely accidental. With three ex ceptions, the error is not of vital importance, but this is hardly true of heats 1028 and 1043. A comparison of the results throughout the columns shows an erratic character, pointing rather to a general uncertainty than to a pronounced wrong in the chemical system.

The variations in results between different laboratories sometimes becomes a matter of great eommercial importance, as shown by G. E. Thackray,* who recites a case where the Cambria Iron Company delivered steel running from .074 to .080 per cent, of phosphorus according to its own determina tions, while the buyer's chemist found it to contain from .088 to .110 per cent. Having agreed upon an arbitrator the metal was reported to hold between .063 and .087 per cent. This experience lei to the distribution of drillings from two different pieces of steel to many of the steel works and chem ists of the country, and the paper just referred to gives the individual records. In the case of one pi_ce of steel, the lowest phosphorus reported was .045, and the highest .055 per cent. In the second piece, the lowest determination was .076, and the highest .091 per cent. In commenting upon these results, Mr. Thackray considers that they are \" quite harmonious \" and encouraging, although he acknowledges that they \" by no means approach perfection, and leave room for further improvement.\" Sec 6. \u2014 Methods by which metallurgical laws must be deduced. \u2014 If the many causes of error which Lave been enumerated could be removed, the investigation of the laws that govern the physical qualities of steel would be wonder fully simplified. As it is, the records include inconsistencies and contradictions which are almost appalling. Taking, for examine, the apparently simple problem of determining the effect of carbon upon steel, we find in Mr. Howe's books the following paragraph : \" While we can not accurately quantify the effects of carbon upon steel, / believe that for ordinary unhardened merchantable steel, the tensile strength is likely to lie between the following pretty wide limits :\" * A Comparison of Recent Phosphorus Determinations in Steel.

They are introduced to call attention to the fact that after leaving out some steels, not merchantable, Mr. Howe believes that the limits are likely to lie between certain extremes ; and these extremes are so far apart, and entangle themselves with one another so con fusedly, that the lay mind might well question whether the results were worth recording. Such generalizations were long ago condemned by Bacon in the dictum, \" inductio quae procedit per enumerationem simplicem res puerilis est.v The laws of steel can be found only by the comparison of metals which have been made by the same process, analyzed in the same laboratory, rolled under the same conditions, and tested in the same way. With records so collaborated, the deductions are of the highest value, even though the results are not strictly comparable with those of other investigators. Not only are carefully recorded experiments to be accepted, but much virtue should be accorded the unformulated general izations of experience. The advances in metallurgical science are seldom due to special investigations. These are usually the exponents, not the causes, of progress, and they refine, rather than create, the methods of procedure. Not one man in a hundred has ever put down on paper a graphic proof that carbon strengthens steel ; by long experience that fact was dis covered without the plotting of a curve, and Avithout any care ful isolation of this element from all confusing conditions. Running along in the mind of the practical man is a long series of results, some of them complicated with high manga nese, some with high phosphorus, some with abnormal rolling, some with erratic analysis ; but, just as in the wildest reso nance of orchestral music a simple air may ring out clearly above the swelling diapason, so are the fundamental facts of"], [40, "12 MANI'FACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. science seen by the observant mind amid a multitude of acci dental conditions, with a clearness which mathematics may not explain. Such opinions must not be taken as final, but there is a vast difference between proving the truth in a disputed issue and verifying an accepted theory. Most of the experiments given in this book are merely illustrative of laws which are com monly received in the metallurgical world. They try to value the factors whose existence is already conceded. There are many things in the manufacture of steel which we do not understand. There are still improvements to be introduced and discoveries to be made ; but the work is all surveyed ; the mysteries have been swept away. The making of steel was once a trick ; it was then an art ; it is now a business."], [41, "13 CHAPTER II. PIG-IRON. Section 7. \u2014 General outline of blast- furnace practice. \u2014 Three kinds of ore are used in the making of pig-iron, viz.: carbon ates, magnetites and hematites. (1) Carbonate (FeC03), called also blackband, or clayband, or clay-ironstone, contains, when pure, only 48.28 per cent, of iron, and is usually roasted to expel the carbonic acid before being charged in the blast-furnace. In England it constitutes four-fifths of the total ore raised, but in this country, although occurring quite widely distributed throughout the coal meas ures, it is usually impure and has been driven from the mar ket by richer ores. (2) Magnetite (Fe304) contains 72.41 per cent, of iron when chemically pure, and is regarded as a chemical union of the ferrous oxide (FeO) w*ith the ferric oxide (Fe2Os). Its dis tinctive characteristic is its attraction for the magnet, although this property is possessed in slight measure by some varieties of hematites, owing to the presence of small amounts of the magnetic oxide. The best-known deposits in this country are in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Michigan. The New York beds are situated for the most part in the Lake Champlain district, and some of them are rendered valueless by the presence of titanium, which gives an infusible slag in the blast-furnace, no method being known by which its action can be prevented. In Pennsylvania the Cornwall banks are the most important, yielding, with good coke, an iron with not over .04 per cent, of phosphorus, but the sulphur in the ore runs about 2.5 per cent., so that a preliminary roasting is necessary. The run of the mine will scarcely average 50 per cent, of iron, while the silica is about 10 per cent. The cop per is the most objectionable feature, occurring in irregular"], [42, "14 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. veins throughout the bed in such quantities that the pig-iron contains about three-quarters of 1 per cent, of this element. This is a serious matter in steel manufacture, for although the copper\" does no harm in the finished material, it gives rise to hot-shortness and produces many imperfections in rolling. In New Jersey some deposits containing sulphur have been worked in the past, the ore being roasted before smelting, but the mines are now almost abandoned. Within the last few years the introduction of magnetic concentration has rendered available large deposits of very lean and silicious magnetites, and has given a new lease of life to the beds of this state as well as to those of New York and Michigan. The great difficulty in this method of concentration arises from the necessity of crushing the ore very fine to free each mag netic particle from the silica, phosphorus and sulphur. The finer it is ground, the purer is the product, but the large pro portion of dust gives much trouble in smelting, both by imped ing the blast and by flying out the down-take into the stoves. Very recently this trouble has been overcome by making this fine concentrate into bricks, and some of these, made from a phosphoritic and very silicious deposit running from 30 to 40 per cent, in metal, contained only 3.3 per cent, silica, .04 per cent, phosphorus, and 67 per cent. iron. If this series of operations of mining, crushing, concentrating and bricking can be carried on in competition with foreign ores, a tremendous development of the lean deposits of New Jersey and New York may be expected. (3) Hematite (Fe203) is the ferric oxide and contains, when pure, exactly 70 per cent, of metallic iron. It occurs sometimes as specular hematite, the fracture presenting a black, shining, crystalline appearance, but often the color is a reddish-brown or yellow, in which case it contains a certain proportion of combined water. The accidental moisture of the ore can be driven off by exposure to a temperature of 212\u00b0 F. (100\u00b0 C), but the combined water remains as an inte gral part of the chemical compound, the percentage of this varying from zero in the specular hematites to over 13 per cent, in the less crystalline varieties. Mineralogists have classified these minerals according to their content of combined water, but it is customary to speak of the purer kinds as"], [43, "15 pig-iron. \" red\" or \" brown\" hematites, while the more hydrous ores are called '* soft\" hematites or limonites. This latter term should really be applied only to bog-iron ore containing over 20 per cent, of water, but the above classification has --been sanctioned by custom and by the Census Bureau. The combined water is not a very important agent in the smelting process, but is always a source of expense in other ways, for if it costs $4.00 to put a ton of ore, containing 10 per cent, of water, in the stock-house of a blast-furnace, then 40 cents per ton has been paid for digging, loading and unload ing water. If such ore contains only 55 per cent, of iron, it will require 1.75 tons* to make a ton of pig-iron, and the cost of this water will be 70 cents on every ton of product, Avith out counting the heat required to vaporize it in the furnace. Thus this harmless ingredient may make a mine unprofit able which otherwise Avould be a paying investment. On the contrary, by a slight twist of logic, it may be said that under some conditions the Avater is a benefit, for with a given con tent of iron oxide it is far preferable that the foreign matter be Avater rather than silica or alumina. Another kind of hematite, knoAvn as fossiliferous ore, occurs for the most part in Alabama, and is supposed to ha\\Te been formed by the action of sulphate of iron upon fossiliferous carbonate of lime. Oftentimes a considerable portion of the limestone remains undecomposed, and the insoluble organic phosphates are a decidedly objectionable characteristic. Even if carbonate of iron is charged into the blast-furnace in its natural state, the carbonic acid is expelled by the heat and plays no part in the smelting operation, so that all three of the ores just mentioned may be regarded simply as com pounds of iron and oxygen, together Avith earthy impurities. The ore is dumped into the top of a blast-furnace with tAvo thirds to three-fourths of its weight of coke. This furnace should be at least sixty-five feet high, and preferably from eighty to one hundred feet, of a form such as is shoAvn in Fig. I. It is kept full of stock, and the combustion of the coke is con- *ln the calculation of the quantity of ore necessary to make a ton of iron, it must be remembered that pig-iron contains carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and other elements, so that even in a very pure, low-silicon pig there will not be over 96 per \u00abent. of metallic iron."], [44, "16 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. stantly maintained by the introduction of hot blast through the tuyeres at the hearth. Immediately in front of these tuyeres the temperature is very high, but the constant tapping of the liquid products and the constant supply of fresh stock from above prevents this high temperature from spreading upAvards, as it would do if nothing were withdrawn from the bottom of the column. The region which is at a sufficiently high temperature to liquefy the stock is known as the \"zone of fusion.\" It reaches several feet above the tuyeres, the exact extent varying with several conditions of furnace practice. When the oxygen of the blast comes in contact Avith the coke, it forms either carbonic acid (C02), or carbonic oxide (CO), but if C02 does form, it is instantly reduced to CO by the next atom of carbon, so that when the gases leave the zone of fusion and travel upward through the stock to the top of the furnace, they may be regarded as a mixture of carbonic oxide (CO) and the nitrogen of the blast. The CO absorbs the oxygen from the ore, forming C02, and leaves the iron in the finely divided metallic state known as \" spongy iron.\" On reaching the lower and hotter parts of the furnace near the zone of fusion, the spongy iron absorbs car bon from the coke, and is thus converted into \" pig-iron,\" which may be regarded as carbide of iron, the percentage of carbon usually running from three to four per cent. The iron also absorbs some silicon, phosphorus, and sulphur from the earthy ingredients of the charge. These probably exist in the pig-iron as silicide, phosphide, and sulphide of iron. In addition to the coke which is charged with the ore, a certain proportion of limestone is added. The carbonic acid of this stone is expelled in the upper part of the furnace, and caustic lime (CaO) remains. In rare cases the stone has been subjected to a preliminary calcining, but the economy of this practice is not yet demonstrated. The amount of lime stone is regulated so that it AA*ill satisfy the silica contained in the ore and in the ash of the coke, and giA*e a slag which is suffi ciently acid to be liquid and run freely from the furnace, and which is also sufficiently basic to absorb the sulphur from the coke and ore."], [45, "PIG-IRON. 17 At the top of the furnace there is an enormous volume of escaping gas derived from the passage of the blast through the column of burning coke and ore. This is composed of nitrogen, together with some carbonic acid and a larger proportion of carbonic oxide, the percentage of the latter being sufficient to make the mixture aA-ailable as fuel. Part of this gas is burned under boilers to furnish steam for the bloAving engines, while the remainder is used for the preheating of the blast. Formerly the air was heated by forcing it through iron pipes which were surrounded by burning gases, but of late years it is the almost universal practice to have a set of brick stoves, filled Avith long narroAv passages. By passing burning gas through a stove for an hour or more, the bricks are heated to a high temperature, Avhereupon the air is bloAvn through in an opposite direction and is heated to nearly the same point. The stoves are used alternately, so that by means of suitable valves the action is practically continuous. In well-equipped furnaces the temperature of the blast is maintained between 1000\u00b0 F. and 1200\u00b0 F., these figures being often exceeded under favorable conditions. Sec 8. \u2014 The American iron industry. \u2014 The distinctive feature of the American iron industry in recent, years has been the development of great deposits of red and broAvn non-hydrous hematites in the Lake Superior district, which now produces one-half of all the ore mined in the country- They are of exceptional richness, running sometimes over 67 per cent, in iron, equivalent to nearly 96 per cent, of Fe203, with only 2 per cent, silica, and most of them are sufficiently free from phosphorus to be suitable for the manufacture of steel by the acid process. In former days it Avas the rule to place the blast-furnace near the ore mines, but this system is passing away. The furnaces of JohnstoAvn, Pa., built to smelt the ores in the hills that environ them, draAv their supply from the mines of Lake Superior, while the quarries of Southern Cuba deliver their product to the valley of the Susquehanna. The main points of the geographical distribution of the iron industry were ably presented by John Birkinbine in his presidential ad dress to the American Institute of Mining Engineers in June,"], [46, "18 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. 1892.* He shows that in 1890, when our pig-iron production reached high-water mark, 69 per cent, of the Bessemer iron and 64 per cent, of all kinds of iron were made in 4 districts. In Table 5 the figures for that year are compared with the record for 1S94, when the entire country was overwhelmed by an industrial and financial cyclone. The comparison -will serve to shoAV the change in relative production when disastrous prices had forced the least favored manufacturers to the wall. Table 5. Production of Pig-iron in the United States by Districts ; gross tons. The Pittsburg district includes Allegheny County, Pa., the Shenango Valley, Pa., and the Mahoning Valley in Ohio. The first furnaces of this region were started on local ores, principally carbonates, but now almost the entire supply comes from Lake Superior, 600 to 1000 miles aAvay. The magnificent development of this center of production is due in great measure to its being within easy reach of the coke of Connellsville, which ranks with the best in the world. Eastern Pennsylvania includes the Lehigh, Schuylkill and Susquehanna valleys, which were developed on local brown hematites and the magnetites of Cornwall, Pa., New Jersey, and Southern New York, aided by the proximity of the anthracite coal fields.

The future of this region lies in the removal of the duty upon iron ore and the economical success of magnetic concentration. The Corn- Avall deposit is an important factor, but its high sulphur and copper, and its non-adaptability to concentrating treatment, will render its position less commanding than in the past. The Illinois district is composed for the most part of the furnaces at Chicago, which draw their ores from Lake Superior and their coke from Connellsville, distances varying from 300 to 650 miles, and which depend for their existence on excep tional railroad and Water facilities and a home market. The Birmingham district in Alabama has certain great advantages, for there are feAv places in the Avorld Avhere fuel and ore are so near together, although, unfortunately, both are of inferior quality, the ore being low in iron and high in phosphorus, and the coal giving a Aveak and impure coke. Sec 9. \u2014 Fuel consumption in American blast-furnaces. \u2014 In the foregoing remarks it has been assumed that coke is the fuel employed, and this is true for the OATerwhelming ma jority of furnaces, for, although anthracite coal is sometimes used from economic considerations, and although it may give excellent results when it constitutes only a part of the fuel supply, it is found that much more satisfactory practice is attained Avhen coke forms at least a portion of the charge. It is customary to classify as an anthracite furnace one which only occasionally uses anthracite in its mixture, so that statis tics on this point are someAvhat misleading. There are also some furnaces Avhich use charcoal exclu sively, since this is supposed to give an iron Avhich is especially valuable in making car wheels and other articles Avhere great toughness must be combined with great resistance to Avear. Its superiority OA*er other irons of exactly the same ultimate chemical composition is Avidely disputed as an antiquated theory, but the testimony in favor of this theory is too strong to be set aside. Fifteen years ago the practice at almost all blast-furnaces was regulated by a \" rule of thumb,\" Avhich Avas generally born of a bigoted belief on the part of an ignorant furnace man that the particular ores and fuel under his control could be worked only in a furnace of certain special lines, and that"], [48, "20 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. it was impious to \" drive\" beyond the certain rate established by time-worn tradition. In 1879 certain experiments Avere instituted at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works, which showed the possibility of enormously increasing the output of a furnace by increasing the amount of air supplied to the tuyeres, and the effect of this discovery was immediately seen in the vigorous blowing and forcing of the furnaces of other plants, and the building of new furnaces at Braddock with an enormous blowing equipment. There was also introduced the radical and revolutionary idea that the pressure on the tuyeres was not the true guide by Avhich to regulate the blast, but that a certain quantity of air should be delivered to the furnace, whether the resistance of the stock was great or small. Under the system of rapid driving, it was thought advis able to make the angle of the bosh about 80\u00b0, in order that the descent of the stock should not be interrupted, and so from 1S80 to 1885 there was a race between rival managers to eclipse the tonnage records of their fellows. It was soon dis covered, however, that this system gave a heavy consumption of fuel per ton of product, for the ore did not stay in the upper part of the furnace long enough to be thoroughly reduced, and part of it was carried doAvn to a zone of higher temperature where C02 absorbed carbon from the fuel. Sec 10. \u2014 Chemical reactions in the blast-furnace. \u2014 The reactions between mixtures of Fe203, CO, C02 and C, are quite complicated and vary with changes in temperature and extent of exposure, so that it may happen that a mixture of C02 and CO, which can reduce Fe203 at a low red heat, Avill oxidize spongy iron at a higher temperature. It may be assumed that the presence of C02 in the tunnel head gases is almost entirely due to the burning of CO by the oxygen of the ore. The reduction of the ore should take place in the very top of the furnace Avhere the temperature is below that at which C02 and C unite ; but if time enough is not given, some of the reduction occurs loAver doAvn in the furnace, where the temperature is higher, and some C02 is immediately con verted into CO by the coke. The carbon so absorbed and car ried away in the escaping gases must be looked upon as Avasted except as far as it is utilized under the boilers or in the stoves"], [49, "PIG-IRON. 21 and it may be taken as a rule, therefore, that the economy of a furnace is proportional to the percentage of C02 at the tunnel head. It is impossible to obtain perfect results, for it is only the loosely held oxygen which parts company with the ore at very low temperatures, and Bell* states that in smelting Cleveland ore, 25 per cent, of the oxygen is retained until the region of the tuyeres is reached ; and he also saysf that the greatest extent to which we may assume it possible to oxidize the carbon as a whole, is so as to have one unit of this element escaping as carbonic acid and tAA*o as carbonic oxide. Sec. 11. \u2014 Modern improvements in blast-furnace practice. \u2014 The heavy consumption of coke which followed the first attempts at rapid driving was not as serious a matter in the Pittsburg district as in localities where coke was more costly. A reform was inaugurated by E. C. Potter, of Chicago, Avho showed* that by a somewhat less volume of blast and by a reduced angle of bosh, the product was only slightly reduced, while the coke consumption was cut down by a very consider able amount. Great advantage also accrued from an enlarge ment of the hearth, but the further suggestion that the bosh angle could be increased with a wider crucible has been found impracticable. The whole subject of modern blast-furnace practice was discussed by Gayley, of The Edgar Thomson Steel Works, Pittsburg, Pa.,\u00a7 before the Mining Engineers, and drawings were given of the furnaces at that works. The last form described is shown in Figure I, and there has been very little change in later practice. It is stated, in the paper just mentioned, that this furnace produced 225,000 tons from one lining, with a fuel consumption of 1920 pounds of coke per ton of iron. Later practice has improA*ed upon this record, but this has been by careful attention to details, rather than by any special change in essentials. Prominent among these determining conditions is the preservation of the lines of the * Trans. A. I. M.

It is also necessary that there shall be a large reserve capacity for heating the blast, so that a maximum temperature is retained nearly uniformly throughout the period betAveen reversals, the work ing conditions of temperature being thus entirely under control. By a constant strengthening of every weak point in prac tice, the life and output of a furnace have been increased far beyond what only a feAv years ago was deemed the limit of hope. The last information* from Edgar Thomson is of a furnace which has made 660,000 tons of pig-iron in a campaign of five years, and Avhich is still in blast. This magnificent record is due in great measure to the working factors just enumerated, but the unequalled richness of the Lake Superior deposits and their porous character, rendering them capable of rapid reduction, are the fundamental conditions which make the result possible. Many furnacemen, in a small Avay, are doing fully as good work, although they can not shoAv the big totals of clean product in a given time. In the dis cussion of Gayley's paper just mentioned, some engineers tried to make detailed comparative calculations on relative sizes and products, but such figures are of little value, for he who does well with little things does not ahvays rule well over bigger things. Nevertheless, it must be recognized in a general way that many furnaces, running on impure ores and fuel, re quire more attention and more study than is needed for the production of the remarkable tonnages which appeal so strongly to American pride. Sec 12. \u2014 Differences in local conditions as affecting fuel economy. \u2014 The great difference betAveen the conditions in two different districts was well brought out by Sir Lowthian Bell in the consideration of Gayley's essay. The examples taken Avere the Cleveland district in England, where the ore does not contain over 42 per cent, of iron, and the Pittsburg region, AA*here it runs at least 60 per cent.

Blast-Furnace Factors Depending on Impurities in Ore and Stone. Thus, while the total difference in favor of Pittsburg prac tice is 357 pounds of coke per ton of iron (as shown in Table 6), the above comparison sIioavs that 295 pounds are entirely beyond the control of the Cleveland smelter. In addition to these necessary increments of fuel consump tion, there are certain difficulties introduced Avith every pound of foreign material. More especially when a high content of sulphur calls for the creation of an extra-basic cinder, but none the less truly when the impurities are less potent for evil, it is plain that the management of a furnace must be more difficult when a large quantity of dirt interferes with the operations, and it follows, therefore, when all other things are equal, that the furnace will more often suffer from those slight attacks of illness which go so far in determining the fuel ratio of the campaign. Sec 13. \u2014 Effect of the impurities of the ore and the fuel upon the furnace practice. \u2014 Aside from the mere volume of foreign matter in ore and coke is the still more vital question of their character. The common and well-nigh universal impurities are alumina, magnesia, lime, phosphorus, silica and sulphur. The lime is usually a benefit, for it saves the addition of a corresponding quantity of limestone. The magnesia is usually considered less desirable, but is deemed beneficial by some metallurgists, provided alumina is absent.* The phosphorus has no appreciable effect on the running of the furnace, but under all ordinary conditions it is almost all reduced and alloyed with the iron. The function of alumina *See Firmstone ; Magnesia and Sulphur in Blast-Furnace Cinder. Trans. A. I. M. _?., Arol. XXIV, 498 and 889. ' Value in Pounds of Coke. Factor. Cleveland. | Pittsburg.

It is stated by Fibers* that \"if the percentage of silica is low, it acts as an acid and hence increases the fluidity of the slag, but if high, it acts as a base and lowers the fusing point.'' The exact equation of alumina has not been written, but it is usually regarded as an objection able component of the charge, save in the case of titaniferous ores, when it may be advantageous by furnishing an additional component of the slag and thus augmenting the fluidity by increasing the complexity of the compound. The silica occurs in the ash of the coke and also in the ore, either free or in combination Avith alumina, magnesia, lime or iron, and necessitates the addition of a proportional quantity of lime. The coke varies greatly, but a fair average of Connellsville product Avill show from 10 to 13 per cent, of ash, the greater part of which is silica. The ore of some of the Lake Superior deposits runs as Ioav as 2 per cent, in silica, but in less favored districts three times this amount is con sidered a fair content, while some well-known beds of Cuba and Spain run about 10 per cent. A certain amount of silica is reduced by the gases and the silicon unites with the pig-iron, the extent of this reaction depending on several conditions, being aided by : (1) Arise in temperature; for at high thermal altitudes, the oxygen has a greater affinity for carbon than for silicon, and, therefore, carbon can reduce silica with production of silicon. (2) A decrease in lime additions; for lime tends to hold silica in proportion to its needs, so that the higher a slag is in silica, the less firmly is any one molecule fastened in that slag. (3) An increase in the total amount of silica present; for when all other things are equal, the greater the exposure, the greater is the opportunity for its reduction, so that if one furnace Avorking on ores Ioav in silica makes three-quarters of a ton of slag to every ton of iron, and another furnace Avork ing on ores high in silica makes one and one-half tons of the same composition, the tendency will be toAvard tAvice as high a silicon content in the second pig-iron as in the first. * Berg- und H'uitenrnannische Zeitung, Vol. XLA'II, p. 253."], [55, "27 PIG-IROX. Sec 14. \u2014 Metallurgical conditions which influence the character of the product. \u2014 It often happens that the effect of two or more factors in furnace work are contradictory, for it is not uncommon to have a high temperature combined with a limey slag in the production of loAV-silicon iron free from sulphur. Sulphur sometimes exists in the ore up to one-half of 1 per cent., and in exceptional cases it is over 2 per cent., but usually the greater part of this element comes from the coke, which may contain over 2 per cent, and seldom has less than one-quarter of 1 per cent. The removal of this metal loid may be accomplished by a limey slag and a hot furnace, it being generally found that it is easier to take care of a given quantity of sulphur from the coke than from the ore. It has been stated that a high temperature aids in the reduc tion of silicon by certain peculiar laws of chemical affinities, but it is doubtful whether there are any such reversed rela tions in the case of sulphur, although a high temperature is necessary in order that a limey slag may be kept fluid and exert its full effect. It will be noticed that one of the conditions assisting in the elimination of sulphur, viz.: high temperature, is also favor able for the reduction of silicon, while the other condition \u2014 a basic slag \u2014 is opposed to it. This complication giA*es rise to variations in practice Avhereby these factors are arrayed against each other for the attainment of certain ends. Thus it is possible to make : (1) An iron Avith high silicon and Ioav sulphur, by running the furnace at a high temperature with a slag sufficiently basic to hold the sulphur, but not basic enough to keep silicon from being reduced. (2) An iron Avith Ioav silicon and Ioav sulphur, by using a lower temperature with a somewhat more basic slag, or a high temperature with a much more basic slag. (3) An iron Avith Ioav silicon and high sulphur, by using a Ioav temperature w*ith a slag not sufficiently basic. (4) An iron with high silicon and high sulphur, by using a high temperature Avith a slag not sufficiently basic. Manganese is another element which is found in many ores, and which occasionally plays an important part in the opera-"], [56, "28 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. tion. A content of only 1 or 2 per cent, in the ore will nearly all be carried away in an ordinarily acid slag, but if a greater quantity of lime be added, there is less demand for metallic oxides in the cinder and the manganese is reduced and alloyed with the iron. A high temperature seems to favor this reaction, but part of this effect may be due to the corresponding increased fluidity in the extra-basic slag. The specifications of high temperature and a limey slag, Avhich fa\\*or the presence of manganese in the pig-iron, tend also toward the elimination of sulphur. \"When the slag is made very basic, as it should be in the production of spiegel to prevent the loss of oxide of manganese in the cinder, the conditions are evidently opposed to the reduction of silicon, so that high-manganese iron generally contains Ioav silicon, and almost ahvays Ioav sulphur. It is possible, hoAvever, by special care, to make a silico-spiegel containing as much as 11 per cent, of silicon and 18 per cent, of manganese, this alloy being used as a recarburizer in steel-making. Sec 15. \u2014 Discussion of blast-furnace slags. \u2014 It is easy to make broad statements concerning the general effect of acid and basic slags, but it is quite another thing to define the limits Avhich determine practice. Thus, in smelting the pure ores of Lake Superior, a slag of 35 per cent, of Si02 and 40 per cent, of CaO might be amply capable of removing all the sulphur, Avhile to make as pure an iron from the sulphurous ores of CornAvall Avill require a reduction of 5 per cent, in the silica and a corresponding increase in the lime. Magnesia has been proclaimed by high authority to be an evil (see Ledebur, Kaemfhner Zeitschrift, No. 2, 1881, p. 53, et seq., et als.), but there are reasons for supposing that it has not had a full hearing. A paper by Firmstone* discusses this question, and it is decided that magnesia is harmful only Avhen the alumina is high. This will also be evident from the analyses of PennsylA*ania Steel Company cinder in Table 9. This giA*es the composition of different slags, the data being culled from various sources, which will illustrate Iioav Avidely the composition may vary, and that differences in furnace * Magnesia and Sulphur in Blast-Furnace Cinder.

Sec 16. \u2014 Appearance of the fracture of pig-iron. \u2014 The three elements, silicon, sulphur and manganese exert an important influence on the appearance of the fracture of pig iron owing to the variations they cause in the chemical status of the carbon. If a normal pig-iron, made from a furnace working at a moderately high temperature, is alloAved to cool sIoavIv, the carbon separates and the entire mass is permeated Table 9. Analyses of Blast-Furnace Slag. by black shining crystals of graphite, while on the other hand if the iron is suddenly chilled after casting, this separation is prevented and the carbon remains combined as carbide of iron, the fracture showing a clear white surface. The silicon, sulphur and manganese interfere in this simple relation with out completely overturning it, so that it is difficult to say in any particular case whether a given appearance is caused by the chemical composition, or by the furnace history that gave birth to that composition.

Experiments by Keeps seem to show that silicon confers greater strength and toughness up to a content of 2 per cent., this being due to the fact that when the silicon is Ioav, the carbon remains combined, producing a brittle and unsound casting. Keep also states (loc. cit.) that the increased fluidity accompanying high silicon is not due to any direct effect of the metalloid j)cr se, but to its property of driving the carbon into the free state. Sulphur exerts an opposite influence, so that iron Avith a high percentage \u2014 say over 0.20 per cent. \u2014 is quite certain to be of close fracture. Manganese has the same effect as sul phur, and, when the metal contains 4 or 5 per cent., the broken surface is quite sure to be white, and lesser quantities have their proportionate influence. In irons with high manganese the tendency to force the carbon into combination is so power ful that there is a marked increase in the total percentage of the latter metalloid. With varying casting-temperatures and different percent ages of the three elements, it is impossible to predict the nature of every corresponding fracture. The necessity for this is in some measure passing away, for it is by chemical rather than by physical constitution that iron is valued, but in com paring irons made from the same ores and by the same methods, the fracture is a valuable exponent of the chemical equation.

The use of gray iron is important, since it is much less liable to break under shock than white iron, but, although this is true as a general rule, there is no certainty that such an iron is tough, for it may contain a large percentage of phosphorus, and since this element makes the iron run fluid, there is a constant temptation to use it and thereby produce a brittle metal.

Much light has been shed upon these two points by a paper published in June, 1895, by W. J. Keep,* who has done so much in the study of cast-iron. The important con clusions of this paper are summarized below, the original wording being preserved as far as possible. (1) Large test-bars are AA*eaker with each increase of silicon, Avhile small bars, as for instance about one-half inch square, are stronger. (2) A small casting grows stronger with each increase of silicon, at least up to 3 j>er cent. (3) The record of one size of test-bar can not indicate the strength of another size, for the reason that with the same * Transverse Strength of Cast-Iron. Trans. A, \u00ab_. Mech. Eng., Vol. XVI."], [61, "PIG-IRON. 33 iron, aside from the local causes of derangement, any change in size, or, in other words, any change in the rate of cooling, will change the grain and strength. Each mixture of iron and each percentage of silicon will produce the best results in some one single size of casting, and not as good a result in any other size. (4) The metal is strong according as its grain is close and fine, and this is gOA'erned by the percentage of silicon and by the rate of cooling, and by local conditions over Avhich the founder has no control. (5) It is the universal opinion that strength is mainly due to the combined carbon which the casting contains, and that weakness is caused by changing it into graphite, which mechanically separates the grains, but the nineteen series of bars under investigation sIioav that combined carbon weakens castings and never strengthens them, the decrease in strength of large castings being wholly due to loosely united crystals and not to any change in the proportion of combined or graphitic carbon. (6) Combined carbon may decrease as castings are larger, but the strength always decreases. This decrease of combined carbon and of strength are both caused by the sIoav cooling, and the decrease of combined carbon has nothing to do Avith the decrease of strength. (7) The general opinion is that graphitic carbon causes weakness. The carbon in a casting, so far as has been proved, is either combined or graphitic. If one decreases, the other must increase ; therefore, if combined carbon produced strength, the same facts that seemed to warrant this conclusion of the chemists seemed to prove that graphitic carbon produced weakness. Again, in graphitic iron the grain Avas coarse, and the flakes of graphite lay betAveen the grains, and it seemed self-evident that these graphitic flakes must of necessity separ ate the grains of iron and cut the casting up, but the same proof that has been produced in the case of combined carbon, to disproATe the accepted opinions, will apply regarding graph itic carbon. Strength or AA*eakness seem to be absolutely in dependent of free carbon, for the looseness of the grain, pro duced by sIoav cooling, so separates the grains that there seems to be more than enough room for the flakes of graphite"], [62, "34 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. to lie in the open spaces. It may be even doubted it the graphite eA*er gets betAveen the grains to make their union less perfect. (8) The effect of A*ariations in the total content of carbon is not known, on account of the difficulty of making laboratory experiments Avhere this one element A*aries and where the rest of the composition is uniform. It Avill not answer to add wrought scraps, for this will not only decrease carbon, but at the same time the percentage of every other element ; and also because such scrap will close the grain and increase strength, independently of the lessening of the carbon. (9) The universal opinion seems to be that sulphur is a damage to cast-iron, but the present series of tests seems to show no ground for this belief, since samples which contain about as high a content of sulphur as is eA'er found in gray castings show both small and large castings beyond reproach."], [63, "CHAPTER III. WROUGHT-IRON. Section 18. \u2014 General description of the puddling process. \u2014 When pig-iron is melted on a hearth of iron ore and is ex posed after fusion to the continued action of the flame, there is a rapid oxidation of the metalloids contained in the iron. The silicon, manganese, sulphur and phosphorus unite with oxygen and iron oxide to form a slag, while the carbon escapes with the products of combustion as carbonic oxide and carbonic acid. By the departure of these alloyed elements, the iron becomes very much less fusible, and Avhen the operation is conducted in an ordinary reverberatory furnace the heat is not sufficient to keep the mass liquid. It first becomes A*iscous, then pasty, and finally is worked into balls, taken from the furnace, and squeezed or hammered into a bloom fit for rolling. The crude puddle-ball, when draAvn from the furnace, is made up of an innumerable number of globules of nearly pure iron, while the interstices between the particles are filled with slag. By the action of the squeezer much of this slag is expelled, and each subsequent rolling remoATes a further quantity, but it is impossible to get rid of all the cinder, and it forms a skeleton which permeates the entire mass of the finished bar, forming planes of separation between the particles of metallic iron. It is unnecessary to say that these films must weaken the material by destroying the continuity of the structure and the cohesion of the particles, and in this respect the slag is an injury. In other ways it is of incalculable benefit, for the sulphur and phosphorus are never entirely removed in the process of puddling, and there is usually a sufficient percentage of them (35)"], [64, "36 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. left in the product to give bad results if they were able to exert their full effect in producing crystallization, but the net work of slag prevents in great measure the tendency to crystal lize and thus allows the presence of a considerable proportion of these elements. If bar-iron be melted in a crucible, the slag separates and the impurities haA*e a chance to exert their full force. Some pure irons will successfully undergo this test, but most brands, including many of high reputation for quality, give a perfectly worthless metal after fusion, owing to the high percentages of impurities they contain. The quality of the finished metal, therefore, is not entirely depend ent upon its composition, but upon the Avay in Avhich it has been heated and Avorked. The piece of iron made in the first rolling of the puddle ball is a rough, crude product known as muck bar. For the making of merchant iron, this intermediate product, together Avith miscellaneous wrought-iron scrap, is bundled into \"piles\" so as to give a bloom of proper sectional area, and this, after being heated to a welding heat, is rolled into the desired shape. If the pile Avere square and were made up of similar pieces of equal length, each layer being at right angles to the one below, and if the bloom were rolled equally in each di rection, it is evident that the plate would be as strong in the line of its length as of its breadth ; but as the bars from which the pile is formed have been made by stretching the material in one way, and as all practical work requires a piece of greater length than Avidth, it will be seen that the finished product will shoAV much better results Avhen tested in the direction of its length than of its Avidth. The result will also depend upon the skill Avith which the pile has been constructed, upon the perfection of the Avelding as influenced by the heating and the rapidity of handling, and upon the freedom of the iron from thick layers of slag. Sec. 19. \u2014 Effect of silicon, manganese and carbon upon the operation of puddling. \u2014 Aside from these important consider ations of content of slag and amount of Avork, the character of the product will depend upon its chemical composition, and this in turn depends ujion the composition of the pig-iron from which it is made and upon the care and skill wish which the operation has been conducted. There are five elements com-"], [65, "37 AA'ROUGHT-IRON. monly found in pig-iron which have an important bearing on the character of the finished material and on the work of puddling, and these Avill be considered separately. Silicon. \u2014 This element is present to greater or less extent in all pig-irons, and may be regarded as an almost unmitigated eA*il, since its oxidation produces silica and this is just what is not wanted to produce a basic slag. MoreoA*er, its union with oxygen does not form a gas, and during its elimination the bath lies dead and sluggish. It is true that metallic iron is set free by the absorption of oxygen from the ore, but this gain is more than offset by the iron oxide which is held prisoner by the silica. Some silicon is oxidized during the melting, so that, with a Ioav initial percentage in the iron, the boil begins very soon after melting. With Avorkmen ac customed to high silicon iron, there is danger of considerable waste in using a lower grade, because the latter melts at a higher temperature, and, since there is not enough silica pro duced from the portions first melted to give a proper quantity of slag, the bare metal is exposed after melting to a hot flame, with the result that copious fumes of iron oxide escape to the stack. The same trouble is sometimes experienced in changing from a pig-iron which has been cast in sand to one which has been cast in chills, but careful practice has shown that this loss in both cases can be aA*oided by regulating the operation so that all the iron is melted at one time, and by keeping the metal covered with a fluid cinder, better results being obtained, both in time and Avaste, than with an iron containing a higher percentage of silicon, or one which carries a quantity of adhering sand. Manganese. \u2014 Although acting in the same way as silicon in giA*ing a dead bath, manganese is not quite as objectionable, for its oxide is a base which replaces and saves an equal quantity of iron oxide, and it also aids in the elimination of sulphur. Carbon. \u2014 Unlike silicon, which varies in different forge irons from 0.25 to 1.25 per cent., and manganese, which is present in all proportions from a trace to 1.5 per cent., pig iron of all kinds contains a considerable proportion of carbon. LeaA'ing out of the question irons very high in silicon or manganese, and speaking only of ordinary forge-irons, it"], [66, "38 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. may be said that the carbon runs from 2.3 to 3.8 per cent. It is often supposed that a mottled or Avhite iron will necessarily be Ioav in this element, but such is by no means a certainty, for the close grain may arise from low silicon which is an advantage, from high manganese which is a disadvantage, or from sulphur which is a decided injury. Loav carbon, moreover, is not such an extremely important matter, for although the elimination of this element lengthens the period of the boil, it must be considered that the carbon facilitates fusion, and that its union with the oxygen of the ore reduces metallic iron without forming any objectionable component of the slag. Sec. 20. \u2014 History of sulphur and phosphorus in the pud dling furnace. \u2014 The elements which have thus far been found to be factors in the operation are silicon, manganese and carbon. In the case of reasonably pure irons, like those used in the manufacture of ordinary acid Bessemer and open-hearth steels, these are all that it would be necessary to discuss, for with such irons it would suffice to eliminate these three ele ments in the presence of any ordinary basic slag, and by ball ing and working the pasty mass, produce a wrought-iron of good quality. These pure irons, hoAvever, are not ahvays obtainable at as low a cost as those containing a greater per centage of phosphorus and sulphur, so that it is necessary to consider the effect of these impurities. Sulphur. \u2014 It was explained in the preceding chapter that the content of sulphur in pig-iron is determined much more by the working of the blast-furnace than by the nature of the ore ; but the continual demand for a low-silicon, low-carbon, close-grained iron for the puddler puts the furnaceman betAveen two fires, and the not infrequent result is a pig con taining from .10 to .50 per cent, of sulphur. This is materially reduced in the process of puddling by passing away as sul phurous acid in the waste gases and by being carried off in the cinder in combination with iron and manganese. Phosphorus\u2014 It has also been explained that the content of phosphorus in pig-iron is not determined in any appreciable degree by the furnaceman, for under ordinary conditions almost all that exists in the ore and fuel is found in the product. In the puddle-furnace, on the contrary, this metalloid is under"], [67, "WROUGHT-IRON. 39 more or less control, and it may be roughly stated that three quarters of the total content may be eliminated, this broad formula being profoundly influenced by the skill of the puddler and the purity of the reagents. The presence of phosphorus in the ore used for fettling the hearth must necessarily detract just so much from the purifying poAver of the slag made from it, while the silica in the ore decreases the basicity of the slag and, therefore, its capacity for absorbing phosphorus ; need less to say that silicon in the iron, producing silica by oxida tion, acts in the same way. A rough sketch of the chemical history of the puddling process is shown by Table 11, AA'hich gives the composition of metal and slag at various stages of the operation. Sec. 21. \u2014 Effect of the temperature of the furnace upon the puddling process. \u2014 The temperature of 'the furnace has an important bearing on the character of the product, particu larly when much carbon is present. Experiments are cited by Stead* showing that in the refining process, which corresponds to the first part of the puddling process, the elimination of phosphorus was inversely as the temperature, ranging from 46 per cent, in hot charges to 91 per cent, with cold AA'orking, in each case about 96 per cent, of the silicon and 30 to 40 per cent, ofthe carbon being oxidized. For many years the phenom enon was explained by supposing that phosphorus would not unite with oxygen at high temperatures, and this was deemed to be conclusively proven by the fact that phosphorus was not burned in the acid Bessemer converter. It is now known that the reduction of phosphorus by high heat in the puddling furnace is due to the very simple fact that carbon has a greater affinity for oxygen as the temperature rises, so that it reduces the phosphate of iron and .returns the phosphorus to the metal. Thus there is an inversion of the relative attrac tion of carbon and phosphorus for oxygen rather than a nega tion of affinities. These facts are now thoroughly understood in the metallurgical world, and, on the one hand, the refinery produces a dephosphorized high-carbon metal by carrying on the oxidation in a cool furnace, Avhile on the other the basic Bessemer eliminates phosphorus at the highest temperatures by the use of irreducible bases. * Journal 1. and S. I., A'ol. II, 1877, p. 372."], [68, "40 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL.

It also follows that it aids dephosphorization, for during the first part of the operation the charge is naturally at a Ioav temperature, and the slag, therefore, carries a higher per centage of phosphorus than it Avould retain if it Avere kept in the furnace and exposed to a high temperature and the reducing action of carbon.

The above results are too few for a valid comparison, but they are corroborated by the regular practice at this works where the universal plates are superior to the product of the shear mill. In all these cases, the stock from which the iron was made was the same, and the tensile strength is constant for all thicknesses. More over, there seems to be a better elongation as the thickness increases, while the reduction of area is fully as high. With less careful work there is a constant retrogression in quality as the size of the finished piece increases, and this is usually recognized in specifications, as will be seen by Table 14, Avhich is copied from a paper by A. E. Hunt.* Sec 23. \u2014 Heterogeneity of wrought-iron. \u2014 The most com- * On the Inspection of Materials of Construction m the United States. Journal I and S. I., Vol. II, 1890, p. 299.

This conclusion is reached after very careful reasoning, and it illustrates the profound influence of this one item of reduction in rolling, lt will be eA'ident that unless the history of the bar is known, ordinary chemical analysis Avill fail to give any information as to Avhether it has been rolled from a pile 4 inches square or from one 7 inches square. In the making of rounds, which Avas the only shape tested by the Board, there is op portunity for very bad practice in beginning to form the piece too early in the operation, for there is a much better chance to work and weld the iron in closed rectangular passes than in the formation of round sections. Usually, a bar which has not receiA*ed sufficient work Avill contain an abnormal percentage of slag, and this can be determined in the laboratory ; but a slight excess does not necessarily imply that the iron has not been Avell Avorked, for it may arise from A'iscosity of the cin der, rendering its expulsion difficult. In any eA*ent, it Avill be seen that, although a certain quantity may benefit the metal by preventing crystallization, anything beyond this must decrease the cohesion of the particles of iron. In the inA*estigation just mentioned, it Avas found that the slag varied from 0.192 per cent, to 2.262 per cent, of the total weight of the iron ; and it must be remembered that these tests Avere made on material destined for a service calling for the best product of the mill. Some makers may haA*e supposed that the presence of slag would facilitate Avelding, but the in vestigation did not bear this out, for it is distinctly stated in the report that, while \" slag should theoretically improve welding, like any flux, its effect in these experiments could not be definitely traced.\" On the contrary, the iron which Avas highest in slag (2.26 per cent.) \"AA*elded less soundly than any other bar of the same iron, and beloAv average as com pared Avith the other irons.\" The percentage of slag not only varied in different brands of iron but in pieces of the same make. This Avas true also of all the factors inA*estigated. Table 15 shows the variations in the same make of iron, tAvo extreme cases being giA'en under each head. It also gives the maximum and minimum indi vidual records."], [73, "45 AVROUGHT-IKON. Sec. 24. \u2014 Conditions affecting the welding properties of wrought-iron. \u2014 These conditions of varying work, percentages of slag, and irregularity of the same irons, not to mention the possible overheating of piles in the laudable effort to produce a perfect weld, complicate so fundamentally the relation between the chemical composition and the physical properties, that it need not be wondered that the committee could not find the exact influence of each chemical compo nent. Table 15, Variations in the Character of Different Specimens of the Same Brands of Wrought-iron and of Different Irons as Sub mitted to the United States Board for Testing Chain Cables. There was formulated, however, the following very valuable conclusion : '* Although most of the irons under consideration are much alike in composition, the hardening effects of phosphorus and silicon can be traced, and that of carbon is obA*ious. Phos phorus up to .20 per cent, does not harm and probably impi*OA*es irons containing silicon not above .15 per cent, and carbon not above .03 per cent. None of the ingredients, except carbon in the proportions present, seem to very notably affect the welding by ordinary methods.\" Regarding this last clause it should be said that the highest sulphur in any sample was .015 per cent., which is A*ery low ; but that copper was present in one instance up to .43 per Same Iron.

Moreover, the high percentages of these three elements Avere coincident in one bar, yet A\\*elding gaA'e fair results, not withstanding that phosphorus was higher than Avas found advisable. A careful reading of the evidence, hoAvever, indi cates that the experiments Avere far from conclusive as to these elements. This matter of welding power was of vital moment in iron for chain cables, but it is also the very root of the entire pro cess, for the integrity of the finished bar depends upon the completeness of the Avelds betAveen the different particles. In Chapter XIX the welding of iron and steel will be discussed at greater length."], [75, "47 CHAPTER IV. STEEL. Section 25. \u2014 Definition of steel. \u2014 Although it seems a per fectly simple matter to give a definition of steel, the task has never yet been accomplished to the satisfaction of all concerned. A true formula must apply not only to all the metals commonly designated by the term, but to all compounds Avhich eA*er have been, or ever will be, Avorthy of the name, including the special alloys made by the use of chromium, tungsten, nickel and other elements introduced to giA*e peculiar qualities for special purposes. Prior to the deA*elopment of the Bessemer and open-hearth processes there Avas little room for disagreement as to the dividing line betAA'een steel and iron. If it would harden in water, it was steel ; if not, it was wrought-iron. When the modern methods Avere introduced, a new metal came into the world. In its composition and in its physical qualities it was exactly like many steels of commerce, and naturally and rightly it was called steel. By degrees these processes widened their field, and began to make a soft metal which possessed many of the characteristics of ordinary Avrought-iron, and which was not made by any radical change in methods, but simply by the use of a rich ferromanganese. NotAA'ith standing this fact, some engineers claimed that the neAv metal was not steel, but iron. The makers replied that it was made by the same process as the hard steel, and that it was im possible to draAV a line in the series of possible and actual grades of product which they made. The problem rapidly became of great importance, since the filling of engineering contracts and the interpretation of tariff schedules depended upon the application of the one term or the other to the soft product of the converter and the melting-"], [76, "48 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. furnace. At this juncture an international committee was appointed from the leading metallurgical societies of the world, and a list of the members shows us a formidable array of well-known names: Holley, Bell, Wedding, Tunner, Akerman, Egleston and Gruner. This committee reported in October, 1876, to the American Institute of Mining Engineers, the folloAving resolution : (1) That all malleable compounds of iron with its ordinary ingredients, which are aggregated from pasty masses, or from piles, or from any forms of iron not in a fluid state, and which will not sensibly harden and temper, and AA'hich generally resemble what is called \" Avrought-iron,\" shall be called iveld iron. (2) That such compounds, when they will from any cause harden and temper, and Avhich resemble Avhat is now called \"puddled steel,\" shall be called weld steel. (3) That all compounds of iron with its ordinary ingre dients which have been cast from a fluid state into malleable masses^ and which will not sensibly harden by being quenched in AA'ater Avhile at a red heat, shall be called ingot iron. (4) That all such compounds, when they will from any cause so harden, shall be called ingot steel. The Institute, in accordance with its rules, declined to pro mulgate any official opinion on the subject, but did recom mend that the proposed nomenclature be used in all future papers presented at its meetings. Sec. 26. \u2014 Decadence of the German nomenclature. \u2014 It is fortunate that no more positive action Avas taken in forcing into use a system which Avas radically Avrong. This classification dis regarded a primal necessity of business, for it is necessary to have a name for the material Avhile in process of manufacture. As a practical malcer of a certain material used in the arts, I Avish a title by which to call it. I can not give orders to make a heat of and wait until it is made, rolled, chilled in Avater, and tested for hardness before it can have a generic name. The word \" steel\" Avas in use for this very purpose in every Bessemer and open-hearth plant in the country ; and when the name was once given at the con- A-erter or the furnace, it clung throughout its history in the rolling mills and shops."], [77, "49 STEEL, Had this circle of scientists never met, the engineering AA*orld Avould soon have learned that all the metals made by the Bessemer and open-hearth processes Avere varieties of steel, and this nomenclature Avould have become as universal among engineers in our country as it is among manufacturers. This AA*ell-intentioned interference spread broadcast an objec tionable and impossible classification, but the harm was gradually passing away as the Avork of the committee Avas forgotten, when Mr. HoAve, in his \" Metallurgy of Steel,\" revived the discarded conceit. His attempt, hoAvever, is recognized as hopeless even by him self, for he opens his great work, published fourteen years after the committee had issued its manifesto, by saying this :* \" The terms Iron and Steel are employed so ambiguously and inconsistently that it is to-day impossible to arrange all varie ties under a simple and consistent classification.\" And he adds, Avith some triumph in the memory of forensic victories, but more pathos over the record of disappointed hopes, that the result would have been quite different \" could the little band, which stoutly opposed the introduction of the present anomaly and confusion into our nomenclature, have resisted the momentum of an incipient custom as successfully as they silenced the arguments of their opponents.\" He closes by completely surrendering to the enemy in these words : \" So firmly has this (generic) sense of the word become established that, unfortunately, it were vain to oppose it.\" It is a pity that after this acknoAvledgment of the final judgment of the metallurgical Avorld, he should commend the practice of calling malleable-iron castings by the name of steel, f simply because they coincide with a definition he has just branded as obsolete, for in so doing he sanctions what is to-day one of the greatest frauds in the business. Steel castings are made by pouring melted steel into a flask. This steel must be made either in a crucible, an open-hearth furnace, or a Bessemer converter, for it is impossible to melt scrap in a cupola and have good steel run from the taphole. It is either ignorance or crime to call by the name of steel castings the hybrid metal made by melting a mixture of pig- * Metallurgy of Steel, p. 1. x Loc. cit."], [78, "50 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. iron and steel scrap in a cupola, and it just as far from truth to apply the term to malleable iron. Any definition of steel which gives room for these mistakes writes its own epitaph as erroneous ami absurd. Sec. 27. \u2014 Cause of failure of certain proposed definitions. \u2014 One reason has already been giA*en why the projected renais sance of a decayed nomenclature Avas a failure. But although the lack of any other general term to denote the product of the converter was a most formidable obstacle, it is easy to believe that this could have been OA*ercome. The whole structure, how ever, lacked a foundation, because there can be no satisfactory definition as to Avhat constitutes harden ing. It will not do to prescribe any test with a file, for there is too much chance for personal equation in such a trial, not to mention the impossi bility of having every file of exactly the same hardness. It will not do to make a quench bend, for the success of such a test is determined in too great a measure by certain variable conditions of the preheating not fully understood, and by the manipulations of the smith. All these points Avere fully understood by practical men at the time the committee was at Avork, and the arguments Avere ably presented by Park and Metcalf.* They asked for a defini tion as to what constituted hardening, and receiAred the ansAver that a dividing line is unnecessary. Prof. Akennanf recommends that it be placed Avhere the quenched piece can not be scratched by feldspar. He recognizes that small vari ations in many elements other than carbon will determine the amount of hardening, and also mentions the difference caused by the temperature of the water and the way in Avhich the piece is immersed, and Avhether it is held still or moved. If the learned professor had wished to condemn his case, he could haA'e done little more. Laboratory, experiments on quenching and scratching Avith feldspar are Avell enough for some purposes, but when these must be performed before the material can haA*e a name, and Avhen such Avork giA*es us * Can the Commercial Nomenclature of Iron be Reconciled to the Scientific Terms Used to Distinguish the Different Classes* Metcalf; Trans.

It is true, as argued by Mr. Hoavo, that many of the common products of metallurgy and art shade imperceptibly into one another ; but it is surely extraordinary when the dividing line cannot be draAvn even in theory, much less in practice ; when, Avherever it falls, it must divide, not intermediate, but finished products, used in enormous quantities, and blending Into one another by insensible gradations, and Avhen every shade of these variations is the subject of rigorous engineer ing specifications. It is customary and necessary in ordering steel to giAre a certain margin in filling the specifications, and it will be evident, no matter Iioav close this margin is, that if a line could be draAvn, it Avould not infrequently happen that he Avho ordered ingot iron Avould receive steel, and he Avho ordered steel Avould receiA-e ingot iron. Sec. 28. \u2014 Difficulty of writing a definition of hardening. \u2014 Many different tests have been proposed at ATarious times for determining the mechanical properties of steels, but although some of them are of value in special cases, the one method of investigation Avhich has become well-nigh universal is to break by a tensile stress and measure the ultimate strength, the elastic limit, the elongation, and the reduction of area. Strictly speaking, none of these properties has any direct con nection with hardness, and it is also true that in special in stances, as with A'ery high carbons, hardening may reduce the tensile strength by the creation of abnormal internal strains ; but in all ordinary steels, it is certain that hardening is accom panied by an increase of strength, by an exaltation of the elastic limit, and a decrease in ductility. Noav, if it is conceded that no practical test defining hard ening has ever been devised, and if it can be shown that sud den cooling produces a very marked increase in ultimate strength, an exaltation of the elastic limit, and a decrease in ductility eA'en in the softest products of the converter and the open-hearth furnace, then we are partially justified in assuming that hardening has occurred on the ground that the more easily recognized correlated phenomena continue in"], [80, "52 MAM I Al TURK ill\" STRUCTURAL STEEL. unbroken order down the scale ofthe various iron products. The conclusion is weak in logic, I will admit, but from the standpoint of the engineer of to-day, who grades everything by the tensile test, and who makes ''strong\" steel and \"hard\" steel interchangeable terms, I claim good ground for my position iu calling steel hardened Avhen it is strengthened. Sec. 29. \u2014 Effect of quenching soft steel. \u2014 The fact that com mon soft steel is materially strengthened by chilling has been widely recognized for many years, but the extent of the alter ation in physical properties in the softest and purest metals is not generally understood. Table 16 gives a series of tests. that I have made, Avhich may shed some light on this point. Table 16. Effect of Quenching on the Physical Properties of Different Soft Steels. Note.\u2014 Bars were *-' \"x:'\u201e\" Hots, rolled from a 6\"x6\" ingot, and were chilled pit a dull yellow heat. As the bars were rolled from a small test ingot, the elonga- tion is much less than the normal, but the consequences of the quenching are Avell marked. Additional tests were made on another sample of soft basic open-hearth metal. The original piece Avas a rolled flat, 4 inches wide and 5-16 inch thick.

No attempt will be made here to give an ironclad formula, but the following statements portray the current usage in our country. (1) By the term wrought-iron is meant the product of the puddle furnace or the sinking fire. (2) By the term steel is meant the product of the cementa tion process, or the malleable compounds of iron made in the crucible, the converter, or the open-hearth furnace. This nomenclature is not founded on the resolutions of com mittees or of societies. It is the natural outgrowth of busi ness and of fact, and has been made mandatory by the highest of all statutes \u2014 the laAV of common sense. It is the universal system among engineers not only in America, but in England and in France. In other lands the authority of famous nam< s, backed by conservatism and governmental prerogative, has fixed for the present, in metallurgical literature, a list of terms which I have tried to show is not only deficient, but funda mentally false."], [83, "55 CHArTEB V. HIGH-CARBON STEEL. Section 31. \u2014 Manufacture of cement and crucible steel. \u2014 By the use of reasonably pure ores and by skillful puddling, it is quite possible to produce wrought-iron in which the phos phorus shall not exceed .02 per cent. This bar of soft pure iron may be converted into hard steel by placing it in fine char coal and exposing it to a yellow heat. By a sIoav process, called cementation, the carbon penetrates the metal at the rate of about one-eighth inch every 24 hours, so that a bar five-eighths of an inch thick is saturated about 48 hours after it arrives at a proper temperature. This operation is carried on in a large retort Avhere many tons of bars are treated at one time, so that it Avill always happen that some parts of the furnace arrive at a full heat much sooner than others, and remain longer at that temperature. Consequently, Avhen such a retort is opened, it is necessary to break a'l the bars and grade them by fracture according to their degree of carburiza tion. The point of saturation is about 1.50 per cent, of carbon, but the average of the whole Avill be about one per cent. The steel thus produced is known as blister or cement steel. Its use is limited by the fact that it ahvays contains seams and pits of slag which Avere present in the wrought-iron, and these defects are of fatal moment in the manufacture of edged tools. To avoid this trouble, cement steel may be melted in crucibles, out of contact Avith the air, and, being thus freed from the intermingled slag, can be cast into ingots and ham mered or rolled into any desired shape. This double process is expensive, and a cheaper and more common method is to put a proper quantity of charcoal into the crucible with crude bar iron, the absorption of carbon progressing Avith great rapidity Avhen the metal is fluid. This practice is almost"], [84, "MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. 56 universal in America, and it is claimed by men whose word must carry weight in the metallurgical world, that it gives a steel equal in every respect to the older method ; but against this must be put the work of firms Avhose name is synonymous Avith most excellent product and who, at much extra cost, use a certain proportion of cemented bar for the most expensive steels. It is difficult to say Iioav much of the extra quality is due to the method of manufacture and how much to the strictest care in Avorking and inspecting, and it is also hard to find out Avhether the conservatism does not arise from the laudable desire to supply old customers Avith exactly the same metal, in name as Avell as in fact, that has been furnished them in the past. In deference to time-honored tradition, it may be Avell to quote Avithout approval or further dispute the folloAving dictum of Seebohm,* which expresses the ancient doctrines: \"The best razor steel must be melted from evenly converted steel.

The aim of all methods is to obtain a malleable metal containing from .60 to 1.40 per cent, carbon, and free from blowholes. For certain purposes some special element like chromium, or tungsten, may be used as an alloy, but with this exception every other ingredient may be regarded as an impurity. Sec. 32. \u2014 Chemical reactions in the steel-melting crucible. \u2014 The best tool steel must be as tough as possible, and, therefore, the phosphorus should not be over .02 per cent. Sulphur, which does not appreciably affect brittleness, but, AA*hich does decrease forgeability, is not quite so important, but should not exceed .04 per cent. Manganese may be present in larger quantity, and it is not an uncommon practice to put into the pot a mixture of manganese ore and carbon so that metal- * On the Mn a u fact urt of Crudbh Cast-Steel.

If the percentage does not exceed .20 it has very little bad effect ; if much above this, it Avill cause brittleness and liability to crack in quenching. As in every branch of industry, a simple outline of operations such as is given above may be elaborated indefinitely by the description of the variations in practice which have been developed in different Avorks. Some such details seem abso lutely essential to the originators, but they may be unknown at other equally successful establishments. There is one feature, hoAvever, knoAvn as \" killing,\" Avhich is ia universal use. Just after the steel is melted there is more or less action in the crucible, since there are several rearrange ments to be consummated. Thus, in addition to the iron and charcoal iu the pot, there is a small amount of glass or similar material to giA'e a passive slag ; there is also a little air, some slag and oxide of iron in the puddled bar, the scale and rust on the surface of each piece of metal, and silica, alumina and carbon from the scorification of the Avails. A little time is necessary after fusion for the A'arious reactions to occur between these factors and for the attainment of chemical equilibrium. Aside from these general reactions, the special work of the \" killing\" epoch is the reduction of silicon from the slag and lining in accordance with the following equation : Si02 + 2C = Si + 2CO. The carbon is draAA'n either from the charcoal, from the metal, or from the Avails of the crucible. In the case of graphite pots the supply from the latter source will be more than ample, Avhile even clay pots furnish quite an amount from the coke Avhich is mixed with the clay in their manufacture. This process of reduction goes on until the steel contains from .20 to .40 per cent, of silicon and the metal lies quiet and \" dead.\" The pot is then taken from the furnace by means of tongs, and the contents are cast into ingot form. The crucible lasts from four to six heats, and the Aveight of a melt is about 80 pounds Avhen the crucible is neAv, the subsequent charges being regulated according to the strength of the scorified walls, and by the desire to loAver the level of the slag line to the less affected portions."], [86, "58 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTI RAL STEEL. Sec. 33. \u2014 Chemical specifications on high steel. \u2014 In olden times all springs, tools, dies, and the like, were made from either cement or crucible steel, but in late years large quantities of high-carbon metal have been produced in the Bessemer con verter and used for many common purposes, although, ordi narily, the steel made by this process contains too much phosphorus to make it suitable for the best work. The manganese in Bessemer steel is much higher than in crucible metal, and this* has a tendency to cause cracks in quenching. Formerly a content of .75 to 1.10 per cent. Avas not uncommon, but the demands of the trade have forced an improvement in this respect, and it is noAv customary to keep the manganese beloAv .80 per cent. ; it is impracticable to have it much beloAv .50 per cent, on account of red-shortness. It is possible to make a much better selection bf the stock for an open-hearth furnace and to produce a steel which is Ioav in manganese, phosphorus, and sulphur. The relative merits of open-hearth and crucible steel have been the subject of A'igorous discussions, but, as in many similar cases, the critics Avho are loudest in expressing their opinions are the least competent to judge. Oftentimes a comparison is made betAveen a pure crucible steel and an open-hearth metal con taining about .07 per cent, of phosphorus and .60 per cent, of manganese, and on the strength of this comparison, and taking the Avord of some ignorant or untruthful open-hearth maker as to the quality of his product, the conclusion is formulated that crucible steel is undeniably superior. Such generaliza tions on insufficient evidence constitute the large majority of those made in our tool shops, but it is evident that no com parison is valid unless the steels are of the same composition, and in this latter respect it will not do to accept the unproven statements even of makers Avho rank as virtuous. To sIioav that this last clause is not meaningless, Table 18 gives analyses of three grades of steel, furnished by one of the large and well-knoAvn steel manufacturers of the country. The first column shoAvs the name by which the maker billed it. Needless to say that the carbon content in these metals is right, for othenvise they Avould be entirely unsuitable, but each sample shoAvs discrepancies between actual composition and name. Crucible steel may and often does contain as"], [87, "HIGH-CARBON STEEL. 59 much as .04 per cent, of phosphorus, but no purchaser expects to have that amount when he buys the product of the pot, and when this figure is considered in connection Avith the high manganese, and above all with the absence of silicon, the Table 18.

The second sample is supposed to fill the Fennsylvania Railroad specifications for springs which call for phosphorus beloAv .05 per cent., manganese below .50 per cent., and sulphur beloAv .05 per cent., but a glance Avill show the liberties that haA'e been taken. The \" low phos phorus\" spring steel contains .072 per cent, of that element, an amount slightly under the average of common rails, but which can by no stretch of AA'ords be called \" Ioav\" for hard metal. The sulphur is extraordinarily high, but where there are no specifications on this element, there is not much ground for criticism, since it has little influence on the cold properties. Sec. 34. \u2014 Manufacture of high steel in an open-hearth fur nace. \u2014 It is perfectly possible to make regularly, in open hearth furnaces, a steel of any carbon desired from .05 to 1.50 per cent., Avith phosphorus beloAv .04 per cent., with manga nese below .50 per cent., and with sulphur below .04 per cent. Such steel has not been tried extensively, and the future must decide just how far it Avill replace the product of the crucible. TJiere are one or tAvo minor points about this material which should be recognized by maker and user. First, there is not as good an opportunity to get a \" dead melt\" in the furnace as in the pot, and hence there is more liability of bloAvholes in the ingots, and seams in the bar.

Second, a heavy heat of open-hearth steel must be cast in masses which are very large in comparison with the 4-inch ingot of the crucible works, and the chances for segregation are correspondingly increased. Table 1!\u00bb will indicate just Iioav much this danger is to be feared. The variations in phosphorus, sulphur, manganese, and copper are trifling, Avhile those of silicon are unimportant. In carbon the difference betAveen extremes is 16 points, and while this may seem to be a great A'ariation in one charge it is necessary to consider that the true comparison is not Table 19.

Section 35. \u2014 Construction of a Bessemer converter. \u2014 The acid-Bessemer process consists in blowing air into liquid pig iron for the purpose of burning most of the silicon, manganese, and carbon of the metal, the operation being conducted in an acid-lined vessel, and in such a manner that the product is entirely fluid. The Avay in Avhich the air is introduced is a matter of little importance as far as the character of the product is concerned. In the earlier days there were many experimental forms of apparatus, the air being blown sometimes from the side and sometimes from the top, Avhile the tuyeres were plunged beneath the surface or raised entirely above it. All these forms have given Avay to the method of blowing the air upAvard through the metal, trusting to the pressure of the blast to keep the liquid from running into the holes in the bottom. Within the last ten years a little excitement was raised by a revival of small converters using top or side blast, like the so-called \" Clapp-Griffiths\" and \" Roberts\" processes, but as every well-posted metallurgist expected, these projects died in early youth, like their numerous predecessors. The converters vary widely in size according to the desired output of the plant, in exceptional cases holding less than one thousand pounds, but the common size for what are known as \" small\" plants treats five tons at a time, Avhile in the \"large\" plants the capacity is from ten to twenty tons. In Figures II and III are given drawings shoAving the 18-ton vessels in use at the Avorks of the Maryland Steel Company, at .^parroAv's Point, Md.

It is in this way only that a blast from the bottom can be suddenly stopped Avithout filling the tuyeres mid air box with molten metal. If bottom blast be used with a stationary vessel, the blast must be continued during all the time required to open the taphole and drain out the metal, so that under the best of practice the results Avill be more irregular than with a rotary form. This fault may be partly OA'ercome by having the blast introduced from the upper surface, but experience shows that the Avaste of iron is greater, and this extra expense completely Avipes aAvay all advantages of a reduced cost of installation. The lining is made of stone, brick, or other refractory ma terial, and is about one foot thick. The bottom is made either of brick or rammed plastic material, the tuyeres being almost invariably of brick, from 20 to 20 inches in length, and with holes from three-eighths to one-half inch in diameter. The total tuyere area varies at different Avorks from 2.5 to 4.0 square inches per ton of charge. The blast is kept at a pressure of from 25 to 30 pounds per square inch during the first part of the IjIoav, but in the case of a very hot charge, or if the slag is sloppy, the pressure must sometimes be reduced to 10 pounds after the flame \" breaks through\" ( i. e., after the carbon begins to burn), to prevent the expulsion of metal from the nos*e. The bloAving engine and the tuyere openings being proportionate to the work in hand, the heats, Avhether heavy or light, are usually bloAvn in from 7 to 12 minutes.

This figure seems quite probable, and, Avith it as a basis, it seems possible to calculate the conditions at earlier stages of the blow. One method of doing this is founded on the content of lime and magnesia. The presence of both of these factors must arise from the introduction of small quantities of cupola or blast-furnace slag into the converter, and, since there is no possible source of supply of either during the process of blowing, they must be in constant quantity throughout the operation. Another method is founded on the content of Table 21. Chemical History of an Acid-Bessemer Charge. Illinois Steel Company, South Chicago, 111., August 13, 1890, F. Julian.

Table 22 shows the figures thus determined. A consideration of these figures will sIioav that there are rad ical errors in the data, since the results do not agree among themselves ; in the second calculation, on the basis of MgO, and in the fifth, on the basis of MnO, the work is palpably wrong, since the figured weight of the first slag is greater than that of the final. Without doubt, some of the trouble arises from the incorporation of slag which was left sticking to the sides of the conA'erter from previous heats, and which melted gradually as the bloAV progressed.

These con ditions, coupled Avith a certain error caused by the slopping of slag from the converter, render it impossible to write the chemical history from the data of one charge. The above attempt is recorded to shoAv the limits which bound any such series of analyses. Similar discrepancies Avill be found between the amount of oxygen theoretically necessary to burn the metalloids, and the quantity actually supplied. Up to the fifth test the oxygen needed for the combustion of the silicon, manganese, and carbon (to CO) should be 1148 pounds. To this must be added about 67 pounds which is absorbed by the iron in the slag. giving a total of 1215 pounds.

Part of the discrepancy may arise from the burning of some carbon to carbonic acid (C02). This action occurs when the bath is cool, but most of the carbon is burned during , the latter part of the operation, when the temperature of the bath has been raised, and under such con ditions carbonic oxide (CO) is the main product. This varia tion in the gaseous products, in accordance with the thermal conditions, makes the results from any one charge of limited value, but it may be roughly stated that during the combustion of silicon, nearly all the oxygen of the blast is held by the bath, the gases consisting of nitrogen and a small amount of carbonic acid (C02), while in the later stages the volume of the products is enormously increased by the escape of carbon as carbonic oxide (CO) and by the expansion due to higher temperature. The presence of traces of phosphorus in the slag, given in Table 21, has been commented upon by Mr. Howe,* who attri butes the phenomenon to a local contamination by shot mechan ically held. This is probably not the whole story, for I have found that acid open-hearth slag with 50 per cent. Si02 may carry 0.04 per cent, of phosphorus, and this could not all come from shot, but must arise, in part at least, from an absorption of phosphorus by oxide of iron. The failure of the silica to break up the resultant phosphate of iron may easily be explained by the persistence with which traces of elements refuse to be eliminated under conditions which suffice for the removal of all but an inconsiderable proportion. I have else wheref dwelt upon this fact at some length. Sec 37. \u2014 Variations in the chemical history due to different contents of silicon. \u2014 With a low initial heat, the elimination of silicon is almost complete before the carbon is seriously affected, but there is a certain critical temperature where the relative affinities of silicon and carbon for oxygen are re versed, and, when this is attained, no matter at what stage of the operation, the silicon immediately ceases to have prefer ence, and the carbon seizes the entire supply of oxygen. This * Notes on the Bessemer Process. Journal I. and S. I., Vol. II, 1890, p. 101. t The Open-Hearth Process. Trans. A. I. M. E., Vol. XXII, p. 462."], [96, "68 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. continues until the carbon is reduced to about .03 per cent., but beyond this it is very difficult to go, for these last traces hold on even though the blast be continued with oxidation of iron. If the metal has contained silicon during the burning of car bon owing to an excessively high temperature, the blowing may be kept up after the drop of the carbon flame and the silicon will be oxidized in preference to iron, but in ordinary practice silicon is eliminated early in the operation, for scrap is added to the charge in sufficient quantity to utilize the excess of heat and prevent the attainment of the critical thermal altitude. The same cooling effect may be attained by the injection of steam into the air supply, but this is less economical than adding scrap, for by the latter method a part of the charge is melted without any extra cost. It has been the practice at many foreign works, particularly in Germany, to have the pig-iron at a very high temperature in the manufacture of rail steel, and blow \"hot\" in order to produce a decarburized metal containing silicon. The steel is cooled to a proper casting temperature by the addition of scrap in the ladle, and large quantities of rails and other products have been thus made with from 0.3 to 0.6 per cent, of silicon. Some pig-iron, notably in Germany and Sweden, contains a considerable proportion of manganese ; this burns in some measure at the same time as the silicon, and is usually all eliminated before the carbon begins to oxidize, but at high temperatures, as well as when the manganese is present in large quantity, the carbon has preference. In Sweden this fact is made use of in the manufacture of tool steels, the opera tion being stopped when the bath is high in carbon, the metal still containing a sufficient proportion of manganese to insure good working. This renders necessary that the silicon content be kept low in the pig-iron in order that none may be left in the steel. Sec. 38. \u2014 Swedish Bessemer practice. \u2014 The Swedish prac tice, which stands on an entirely different footing from American and English work, has been thoroughly discussed by Prof. Akerman,* and many of the following statements * Bessemer Process as Conducted in Sweden. Trans. A. I. il. E., Vol. XXII, p. 265\u00bb"], [97, "69 THE ACID-BESSEMER PROCESS. are founded on his authority. The pig-iron is made with silicon not much over 1.0 per cent, to insure that the product shall be free from this metalloid even if the blow be inter rupted when high in carbon. The charge is taken in a molten state from the blast-furnace to the converter, a practice which has been in general use in Sweden since the first trials of the process in 1857, so that our most modern plants in their use of \"direct metal\" are simply copying a system which for many years was looked upon as too primitive for advanced metallurgy. The slow working and small charges which must always characterize the Bessemer practice of Sweden, renders necessary a hot-blowing metal, and since the silicon can not be high without danger of leaving some in the product, it is customary to have from 1.5 to 4.0 per cent, of manganese in Table 23. Analyses of Manganiferous Bessemer Pig-irons and the Resulting Baths and Slags. the pig. Table 23 gives analyses of metals and slags at differ ent periods of the operation, the data being taken from the paper by Prof. Akerman just referred to. It will be seen that when manganese was present in large proportion, there was quite an amount left in the steel after the boil had begun and even after most of the carbon had been eliminated. This will be further illustrated by Table 24, which gives additional results from the Westanfors Works, and which is also taken from the paper by Akerman.

It is quite true that the charge is in a state of violent ebullition and that the slag is constantly carried down into the metal, but, nevertheless, such a mixing does not seem to be a necessary and inherent part of the opera tion, fur, when the heat is first turned up, the silicon is imme diately oxidized although no slag is present. In short, the question almost resolves itself into a reductio ad absurd cm, for it is the oxidation of the silicon which first creates the slag, and hence it can hardly be that slag is necessary for tho 'Trans.

It is quite true that the slag does automatically adjust its own composition, but probably with much less precision than in the open-hearth furnace. In American practice no attention is paid to the composi tion of the slag, for at most works the iron contains only a trace of manganese, while at others it hardly ever exceeds 0.50 per cent., this amount rendering the slag somewhat more fluid, while, with a content much above this, there is consid erable loss of metal by slopping. Whether the initial metal contains manganese or not, there will always be a certain proportion in the final slag from the reaction with the recar burizer. An average sample was taken of about one hundred heats at the Pennsylvania Steel Company's works, and the results are given in Table 25 in comparison with the analysis Table 25. Composition of American Bessemer Slags. of Chicago slag as given in Table 21. No attempt was made to separate the different iron oxides, the metal being all calculated as FeO. The composition of the slag is sometimes greatly changed in one or more charges by the practice of blowing with the vessel partly tipped over while the carbon is burning. This position brings some of the tuyeres above the level of the metal, so that the blast rushes over the surface, oxidizing considerable iron, and also burning part of the CO to C02. Under ordinary conditions, the gases escaping from the mouth of the converter during the boil consist of N and CO, but when a part of the air enters just above the metal and the rest from below, as it will do if the vessel is inclined, there will be a greater calorific development, so that this method is taken to raise the temperature of a cold charge at the expense of a greater waste of iron, and a greater wear of the lining.

These cold charges may arise from too low a content of silicon, from a low initial temperature, or from a newly repaired vessel. It is unusual in our rapid American prac tice to have much difficulty from insufficient heat, for it is not uncommon to make six, seven, or even eight heats per hour from a pair of 5 or 8-ton vessels, and turn out from 25,000 to 30,000 gross tons of ingots per month. Under these conditions a content of one per cent, of silicon in the pig-iron, without any manganese, is found sufficient for the production of the necessary heat. Little attention need be paid to the initial content of carbon, for, as it burns only to CO, and as the nitrogen and carbonic oxide must both be Table 26.

Sec 40. \u2014 Calorific history of the acid-Bessemer converter. \u2014 The calorific history of the acid-Bessemer bath may be under stood from Table 26, in which it is assumed that the energy available for heating the bath is that produced by the com bustion of silicon, carbon, and iron, minus the heat absorbed in raising the products of that combustion to the temperature of the bath, the amount thus absorbed being the total sen sible heat in the products minus the heat in the initial metal due to the heated state of the above elements. The initial temperature is taken as the starting point, notwithstanding that at the time when the carbon begins to burn the bath is hotter than at the beginning, for such an increment must be produced by the combustion of some of the elements, and all the heat of that combustion is assumed to be imparted to the metal. It is also supposed that the average temperature of the bath during the operation is 200\u00b0C. above the initial heat. The assumption that two per cent, of iron is burned to use ful purpose, is founded on the fact that the Bessemer depart ment at the Pennsylvania Steel Works produces about 120 tons of vessel-slag for every 1000 tons of pig-iron. This slag, after being cleaned by the magnet, averages 15 per cent, of iron, so that the loss is 1.80 per cent, of metal. The volume of slag is determined in great measure by the amount of silica available for each heat, and this silica comes from the wear of the lining, from erosion of the bottom, and from combustion of silicon. The percentage of the latter element in the pig-iron used in the above practice is about 1.75 per cent., which is somewhat higher than is essential, so that scrap must be used to cool the charge. If the pig-iron were sup posed to contain only 1.00 per cent, of silicon, the weight of the slag will be considerably reduced, but as the wear of the bottom and lining will remain nearly constant, the decrease will not be proportional. It will be assumed in the present calculation that 1.5 per cent, will represent the usual loss of combined iron in the cinder. A part of the metal enters the slag as shot, a separation by the magnet giving an average content of from 6 to 8 per cent., indicating a loss of about three-quarters of one per cent, of the total output, and this portion is a complete loss as far as both product and heat are concerned. The large"], [102, "74 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. pieces of scrap in the vessel slag may be picked out by hand, and, as these are generally returned to the cupolas without reweighing, they are not reckoned in the percentage of loss. The smaller particles can only be recovered by the rather expensive process of crushing the slag and passing it over a magnetic separator. There is about 10 per cent, of loss in the converter in ordinary practice, of which the metalloids do not give over 5 per cent., so that about 5 per cent, of metallic iron must be accounted for. The amount combining with the slag has been shown to be about 1.8 per cent., while the shot is 0.75 per cent., so that from 2.5 to 2.75 per cent, of metal must be ejected from the nose of the vessel by the force of the blast in the form of fine dust and splashes. Most of this metal is oxidized outside the converter, but a part of it is burned within and gives its heat to the charge. Together with the 1.5 per cent, which enters the slag, we may assume that 2 per cent, in all is available as fuel. Sec 41. \u2014 Use of direct metal. \u2014 It has been the custom in Sweden, from the earliest days of the Bessemer process, to use the pig-iron as it conies from the blast-furnace without allowing it to become solid, while in other countries it was almost invariably found, during the early history of the art, that it was more economical to remelt the iron in cupolas. The success of the Swedish metallurgists arose partly from the necessity of saving fuel in a country where coal was not to be found, and partly from the favorable character of the native pig-iron, which, being made from charcoal, never contained high silicon, and which was almost always low in both sulphur and phosphorus owing to the purity of the ore and fuel. Moreover, a large proportion of the Swedish Bessemer pro duct has been, and still is, a very hard steel, the blow being interrupted when the metal contains a considerable percent age of carbon, and therefore the operation can be conduc ted at a lower temperature, and a lower content of silicon is necessary. The manufacture of this hard steel is made prac ticable by the low phosphorus and low sulphur in Swedish irons, and although the method of interrupting the blow gives"], [103, "75 THE ACID-BESSEMER PROCESS. very irregular result -, it will generally happen that the steel is suited for some purpose, and it can be graded after it is made. The failure of the direct metal process in other countries arose from the fact that the product of a furnace on one day contained so much silicon that the charges were too hot, on another day the silicon was too low and the blows were too cold, while on the third day the iron was so high in sulphur that the steel was worthless. By allowing all the iron to become cold, and by mixing the different qualities according to frac ture, and, at a later period, according to chemical composi tion, it was possible to get a more regular metal which would represent the average product of the furnace. It was also possible to mix the iron from different furnaces, certain brands being prized on account of their hot-blowing or their cold-blowing qualities, when the reason for their peculiarities was unknown. The conditions in later years have altered the economic situation, and modern practice has reverted to the more primitive system of using the metal directly frbm the blast furnace. This change has been made feasible in great measure by improved blast-furnace practice, but even now the product of a single furnace sometimes varies from cast to cast much more than is desirable for regular results in the Bessemer converter. This irregularity in the character of the pig-iron is provided against at some works by having a reservoir holding one or twc hundred tons, always kept full, into which the products of several furnaces are poured, and from which the average metal is drawn when needed. This arrangement renders almost impossible any sudden changes from charge to charge, either in the temperature of the iron or in its composition, and it bids fair to become the universal practice, both in this country and abroad, for acid and basic Bessemer plants. In some works the percentage of silicon in every cast is determined while the iron is on its way from the blast-fur nace to the mixer, so that the blower can be forewarned of any change which is about to take place in the character of the iron. Much information is also gained by a fracture test"], [104, "76 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. made upon a small ingot which is cast in an iron mold, every precaution being taken to have all the conditions of pouring as uniform as possible. Sec 42. \u2014 Use of cupola metal. \u2014 The full benefits of the direct metal process can only be obtained by a works possess ing more than one blast-furnace, and making a large output. It is also desirable that these furnaces should be within a convenient distance, say two miles, of the Bessemer depart ment, for, otherwise, there will be considerable loss from chilling. For these reasons there are some plants which still remelt all their iron. The cupolas used for this purpose are practically alike in different localities. They measure from 6 to 8 feet in internal diameter, while the height should be at least 20 feet, and can better be 30 feet, to save fuel. Formerly there were about 8 tuyeres, about 5 inches in diameter, but the tendency has been toward an increase in the number to thirty or forty, the size being correspondingly reduced. The blast pressure is about 12 ounces per square inch. One cupola will melt from 200 to 250 tons in 24 hours and will run about 72 hours. The consumption of fuel varies according to the height of the cupola, and according to the man agement, one pound of coke being required for 11 pounds of iron in some works, while in other establishments a ratio of 15 pounds of iron to one pound of coke has been attained. This coke must be as free as possible from sulphur, for it is not unusual to have the content of sulphur in the pig-iron raised .02 or even .04 per cent, during the melting. Table 27.

The true way to find the amount of iron oxidized is to weigh and analyze the cinder running from the slag-hole. Table 27 gives the record for 24 hours on 7-foot cupolas. Sec 43. \u2014 Certain, factors affecting the calorific history of the converter. \u2014 Aside from the errors involved in the suppositions concerning the burning of iron, the theoretical effects of silicon and carbon upon the operation of the converter are never realized on account of several losses, which may be enumerated as follows : (1) By radiation and conduction. (2) By decomposition of the moisture in the blast, (3) By melting the lining and bottom. (4) By excess of air passing unaffected through the metal ; for even though such excess may burn the CO in the upper part of the vessel to CO\u00bb, a large part of the heat thus pro duced is carried away in the waste gases rather than absorbed by the bath. It would be very difficult to make a quantitative estimate of these disturbing factors, and it would be equally unprofit able, for it is easy to obtain sufficient heat without much extra expense by a slight increase in the content of silicon in the pig-iron. Until within a few years it was thought necessary to have from 2.0 to 2.5 per cent, of silicon in the metal as it entered the converter, but the general practice at the present time is to have from 1.0 to 1.5 per cent., while in the case of one American works the average run of cupola metal contains from 0.6 to 0.8 per cent. This reduction of the calorific power has been made prac ticable by several improvements in practice, none of them of overwhelming importance, but which form a considerable total when added together. Some of these details may be enumerated as follows : (1) Fast and continuous running, the iron never standing long enough to cool, and the steel ladles and vessels being always hot."], [106, "78 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. (2) Quick blowing, the radiation from tin* vessel being proportionately decreased, and the time lessened during which the companion and idle vessel is cooling. (3) Good bottoms and vessel linings, the heat required to fuse the scorified material being correspondingly reduced, and delays for repairs avoided. (4) Quick changes of bottoms, less cooling of the vessels occurring while putting on a new section. (5) The practice of blowing with the vessel partly tipped over when the charge is cool, as described in Section 39. It was formerly necessary to have an excess of calorific power in the iron in order that there should be a margin of safety when there was a delay or when a bottom was changed, but the expedient of blowing with the vessel inclined is now in general use, and, to some extent, has rendered this margin unnecessary. It is the opinion of some metallurgists that this decrease in the initial content of silicon has resulted in a better quality of steel, and Ehrenwerth has endeavored to show why this should follow. His argument may be presented thus :* When a high content of silicon is used, it is found that there is a greater proportion of free oxygen in the gases which escape from the converter during the first stages of the blow. This change in chemical relations arises from the fact that the percentage of carbon is nearly constant in all irons, and, therefore, with an increase in silicon, there is a corre sponding increase in the proportion which the silicon bears to carbon, and a corresponding change in the affinities. Granting that the presence of free oxygen in the gases escaping from the vessel during the first part of the process is due to the proportionately greater quantity of silicon as com pared with carbon, then it would naturally be expected that, if the metal at the end of the operation should, for any reason, contain a high proportion of silicon as compared with its con tent of carbon, the escaping gases would contain free oxygen. This proportionately high silicon at the end of the opera tion is found in heats which contained a high initial percent age of silicon in the iron, and hence such heats would be * Das Berg- und Huttenwesen aus der Weltausstellung in Chicago. Ehrenwerth, 1895, p. 276."], [107, "THE ACID-BESSEMER PROCESS. 79 expected to have free oxygen in the gases which are formed at the close of the operation, and this free oxygen will signify a more highly oxidized and therefore an inferior condition of the metal. Notwithstanding the argument, which has just been advanced, that the practice of tipping the converter in the case of a cold-blowing charge has rendered unnecessary as large a margin of calorific power as was formerly necessary, it still remains true that it is advantageous, and that it is cus tomary, to have a slight excess of silicon to allow for delays and new bottoms. It is necessary, therefore, to lower the tempera ture of normal charges by the addition of steel scrap or solid pig-iron, the amount so added being determined from the behavior of the preceding charge, with allowances for any change in the thermal conditions. The skill attained in estimating the temperature of melted steel seems almost incredible to the lay mind, for when the iron is very regular and all other conditions are uniform, it is possible to detect the difference caused by a variation of 100 pounds in the amount of scrap added to a 7-ton charge in the converter, and I have elsewhere* tried to show that this rep resents a difference of only 13\u00b0 C. It must be acknowledged that all heats are not regulated to such exact measure, but a variation of three or four times this amount is as much as is considered allowable, and more than is expected in current American practice. This accuracy can only be obtained by regular and uninterrupted work, so that we naturally would assume, and, as a matter of fact, do actually find, that the best \"scrapping\" follows the fastest running. This fact alone is an all-sufficient answer to the criticism of foreign metallurgists that the large outputs of American Bessemer plants have necessarily been made at the expense of quality. There is absolutely no evidence to show that an ample supply of air, and a consequent shorter blow, will give an inferior product. On ths other hand, the more rapid action renders possible a lower initial content of silicon, and this is thought to be an advantage. *The Open-Hearth Process. Trans. A. I. M. E., Vol. XXII, p. 392."], [108, "80 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. Aside from this one item of short blows, there is not a single feature necessarily connected with a heavy output which i-. open to criticism. A large product means simply that no time is lost; that one blow begins when another ends; that the vessel linings are in good condition ; that bottoms are quickly changed; that the vessels are always ready for the iron, ami the iron ready for the vessels ; that the spiegel cupolas work with regularity, and furnish the recarburizer as soon as it is needed ; that the steel is of the right temperature so that the ladles are neither burned through nor sculled, and the pit is free from \" messes\" ; in short, that the machinery is ample, and the men capable. In spite of any statements to the con trary, the fact remains that the fast work of American plants sacrifices nothing but energy and brains. Sec 44. \u2014 Becarburization. \u2014 The method of recarburizing in Bessemer practice varies with the character of the product. In making soft steel, solid ferro containing 80 per cent, of manga nese is thrown into the ladle during pouring, the loss of metallic manganese being about 0.2 per cent, of the charge. With rail steel it is customary to add melted spiegel-iron either in the vessel or in the ladle, but sometimes solid ferro is used to supply manganese, melted pig-iron being poured into the ladle at the same time to give carbon. By this latter method the oxidation of manganese in the cupola is avoided, but the additional danger is encountered of incomplete mixing. When carefully carried out, very little trouble arises from this source, but it is more likely to occur with rail steel than with soft metal, for there is less bubbling and boiling in the higher carbon bath and, therefore, less automatic equalization. The loss of manganese depends upon the condition of the bath and upon the amount which is added. In making soft steel it is necessary to blow until the carbon is reduced to about .05 per cent., and, under these conditions, if manganese be added to the extent of .60 per cent, of the weight of the charge, the steel will contain .40 per cent., being a loss of .20 per cent. If, on the contrary, 1.30 per cent, be added, the steel will contain only .90 jjer cent., being a loss of .40 per cent. It seldom happens that soft steel is wanted with over .60 per cent, manganese, but larger proportions are not unusual in"], [109, "81 THE ACID-BESSEMER PROCESS. rail steel. In the latter case it is feasible to economize by stopping the blow when the carbon is about .10 per cent., and, under these circumstances, an addition of 1.10 per cent, will suffice to give 0.90 per cent, in the steel. These figures must not be considered absolute, for they are only approximate and represent about what may be expected in the long run rather than on any one heat. A further discussion on this point will be found in the remarks on recarburization in the open-hearth furnace."], [110, "82 CHAPTER \\rII. THE BASIC-BESSEMER PROCESS. Section 45. \u2014 General outline ofthe basic- Bessemer process. \u2014 The basic-Bessemer process consists in blowing air into liquid pig-iron for the purpose of burning most of the silicon, man ganese, carbon, phosphorus, and sulphur of the metal, the oper ation being conducted in a basic-lined vessel, and in such a manner that the product is entirely fluid. The method by which the air is introduced has little effect on the character of the product, but, since it is often necessary to cease blow ing temporarily in order to take tests of the bath, the use of a rotary vessel with bottom blast is universal. The distinctive feature of the basic vessel is a lining which resists the action of basic slags ; this is usually made of dolo mite, but sometimes a limestone is used containing a very small proportion of magnesia. The stone must be burned thoroughly to expel the last traces of volatile matter and then ground and mixed with anhydrous tar. The bottom is sometimes made by ramming the same material around iron pins which are withdrawn after firing, and sometimes by using ordinary acid tuyere bricks with dolomite rammed between them. These brick tuyeres are cut away quite rapidly by the slag, but they can readily be replaced in the interval between heats. The highest function of the lining is to remain unaffected and allow the basic additions to do their work alone, so that the rapid destruction of a basic, as compared with an acid lining, is not due to any necessary part it plays in the operation, but to the fact that there is no basic material in nature which is plastic, and which by moderate heating will give the firm bond that makes clay so valuable in acid practice. The agent used in its place is a"], [111, "THE BASIC-BESSEMER PROCESS. 83 rich tar, and this forms a strong coke under the action of heat and resists for a long while the scouring of metal and slag, and it generally happens that, by the time this coke is burned, the dolomite has become partially fused and \" set.\" There is always, however, a slight shrinkage in the burned stone, no matter how thoroughly it has been roasted, so that there is an ever-present tendency to self-destruction through the formation of innumerable disintegrating cracks. When air is blown through pig-iron, the first element affected is the silicon. This is true in both the acid and the basic processes, but the completeness of the elimination is less certain in the acid process, for a part of the silicon is sometimes left after the carbon is burned, owing to the production of an excessive temperature at an early stage of the operation. In the basic converter the incomplete combustion of silicon does not occur owing to three reasons, viz.: (1) The silicon is lower in the pig because the oxidation of phosphorus is relied upon for heat. (2) Burned lime is added before blowing in order to seize the silica as soon as formed and prevent cutting of the lining, and the heating and melting of this lime absorbs so much heat that the critical temperature can not well be reached, especially since every increase in silicon must be met by a corresponding increase in lime. (3) The basic slag has a greater affinity for silica than the -very silicious slag of an acid converter, and it is probable that under these conditions the critical temperature is raised. When the silicon is eliminated, the carbon begins to burn and continues until there is only about .05 per cent., while the manganese follows the same course that it does in acid work, part of it being eliminated while the silicon is burning and another part during the combustion of carbon. The proportion of manganese present at any particular- time will depend upon the original percentage in the pig, but, compar ing similar contents, the amount eliminated will be less than in the acid practice, for there is a less demand for its oxide in a basic slag, and the inducements to oxidation are there fore taken away. Sec 46. \u2014 Elimination of phosphorus. \u2014 With the exception"], [112, "84 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. of the basic lining, which is supposed to remain inert, and the basic slag, which has no chance in the early part of the oper ation to do anything besides aid slightly in the burning of silicon and retard slightly the oxidation of manganese, the reactions in the metal in a basic converter are almost identical with the reactions in the acid vessel up to the point when the carbon is reduced to .05 per cent. From this point com parison ceases, for there the acid process ends, while the basic begins the characteristic chapter in its history in the elimina tion of phosphorus and sulphur. In an acid heat phosphorus is always present to a certain extent, and, if blowing were continued, it may be supposed that at the very surface of an air bubble phosphoric acid would be formed which, rising through the metal, would unite with oxide of iron and form phosphate of iron ; but this would immediately come in contact with a silicious slag, or, in other words, with a slag possessing more than enough silica to meet the pressing requirements of its bases, and the silica being immediately seized by the oxide of iron, the unprotected phosphoric acid would be robbed of its oxygen by the metallic iron. This may seem a very long explanation of the simple fact that phosphorus does not oxidize, but there are many reasons for supposing that in many chemical actions the atoms are in a state of general translation, so that while many compounds are formed, only those remain which find a suitable environment. It is difficult to explain the forma tion of phosphoric acid in the basic converter without assum ing an action which can just as readily obtain in acid practice, although in the one case the product finds a suitable resting place while in the other it is instantly destroyed. During the elimination of carbon, a certain small quantity of phosphorus is burned and held by the slag, but for practical purposes it may be assumed that the percentage at the drop of the carbon flame is equal to the initial content. From that time the phosphorus seizes the oxygen in the same way as the silicon and carbon had done before, and the iron is thus perfectly protected, the phosphoric acid immediately unit ing with the lime. It might be supposed that any other base like oxide of iron would serve to hold the phosphorus, but it is"], [113, "85 THE BASIC-BESSEMER PROCESS. found that phosphate of iron is easily reduced by carbon, and that it is in other respects inferior to the oxide of calcium which gives a stable compound. Sec 47. \u2014 Amount of lime required. \u2014 The amount of lime needed will depend upon three conditions, viz.: (1) The amount of silicon in the pig. (2) The amount of phosphorus in the pig. (3) The quality of the lime. If the charge is 15,000 pounds, containing 0.50 per cent. silicon, it will produce 160 pounds of silica ; and if the final slag must contain 12.5 per cent, silica, then the slag must weigh 1280 pounds ; and if it must have 50 per cent. CaO, then 640 pounds of unsatisfied CaO must be added. The qualification is inserted that it must be \" unsatisfied,\" for each pound of silica in the lime detracts from its efficacy. Thus, if the lime contains 4 per cent. Si02, there will be 4 pounds of silica in every 100 pounds of addition, and if this is to be made into a slag containing 12.5 per cent, of Si02 and 50.0 per cent, of CaO, then 16 pounds of CaO is useless as far as it can have any effect upon the metal, since it will be appropriated by its own silica. In this way 20 pounds of the lime out of every 100 pounds, or one-fifth of the total amount, is used in satisfying itself. The amount of silica derived from the lime and from the silicon does not entirely determine the quantity of lime, for there is evidently a limit to the possible content of phosphoric acid in the cinder. Thus, if a bath of 15,000 pounds contains 3.00 per cent, of phosphorus, it will produce 1030 pounds of phosphoric acid, and if the final slag is to contain 50 per cent. CaO and not over 20 per cent. P205, then this slag must weigh 5X1030=5150 pounds, so that 5 .\u00b0=2575 pounds of CaO must be added to the charge. It is not specified in this case that the CaO shall be \" unsatisfied,\" for it will be immaterial as far as phosphorus is concerned what the silica may be in the lime as long as the demands of silicon are met. Sec 48. \u2014 Chemical reactions in the basic converter. \u2014 The qualitative chemical history of the basic converter is shown in Table 28, which gives the analyses of metals, slags, and gases at various stages of the operation, as given by Wedding. The high percentage of oxygen and carbonic acid in the"], [114, "86 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. gases during the first stage of the operation arises from the chilling action of the basic additions, for at low temperatures carbonic acid is not readily reduced by carbon, but as the metal becomes hotter the carbon assumes more complete command and appears almost entirely in the form of carbonic oxide. At the end of the blow, when phosphorus is burning, the oxygen is held in the bath and the only gaseous product is the nitrogen, so that when the combustion of phosphorus is ended there is no such sudden change in the character of the flame as marks the death of the carbon reaction, and the usual method of determining the purity of the metal is to turn down the vessel when it has blown a certain time and make fracture tests on small sample ingots. This is, perhaps, the only safe way to tell the critical point in regular practice, but it is quite certain that there is a posi- Table 28.

This alteration is not so sharp that he who runs may read, but I have turned down a large number of heats, made from different kinds of iron, guided solely by this slight change in appearance, and in each case my judgment was corroborated not only by the chemical result, but by the independent observation of an associate. Sec 49. \u2014 Elimination of sulphur in the basic converter. \u2014 Sulphur is removed for the most part at the same time as the phosphorus, but, if present in very large quantity, it may be necessary to continue the blast after dephosphorization with the sacrifice of a little iron. In a series of heats made by the Pennsylvania Steel Company, in 1883, a content of 0.25 per cent, was regularly reduced below 0.05 per cent. Manganese was present in this case up to about 2.0 per cent., and this is found to aid in the work, probably by the formation of sulphide of manganese. Even after the manganese has entered the slag it may be available for this function, for it can be reduced by the phosphorus and incorporated into the metal. Table 29 is copied from a paper by Stead* to show the increase of man ganese in the bath during a time when there was no addition of this element from outside the vessel. Table 29. Reduction of Manganese from Slag in the Basic Converter. (S?e Journal I. and S. I., Vol. I, 1893, p. 63.)

Moreover, the lumps of lime do not immediately become incorporated into the slag and no true sample can be taken. It is, perhaps, from these causes that contradictory statements are made by careful observers. Wedding states* that there is a volatilization of both sulphur and phosphorus, as proven by the fact that the slags from sulphurous metal do not give correspondingly increased per centages of CaS, while in the cinder from hot charges there will sometimes be from 30 to 40 per cent, less weight of phosphorus than was present in the pig-iron, although a cold blow will show the full amount.

The analyses and summary are given in Table 30. It will be noted that the calculation rests on \" the probable weight of liquid slag\" for one heat, and this can hardly be con sidered a final and conclusive proof that volatilization can not occur, or that it does not often occur, or even that it does not usually occur. In another chapter (see Section 89) I have tried to show that such loss of sulphur may take place in open-hearth practice, and, if this is true, it seems probable that it will also hold good in the converter. Sec 50. \u2014 Calorific equation of the basic converter. \u2014 An account by Hartshorne* of the practice at Fottstown, Pa., agrees quite well with the data above given for Horde. The cupola mixture is of the following composition in per cent. : Si, 0.3 or less ; S, .03 or less ; Mn, 0.80 ; P, 2.50 to 3.00. From 11 to 13 per cent, of lime is added, and the final slag is of the following compositions in per cent. : Si02, 5.10 ; CaO, 45.26 ; P.O5, 21.37 ; FeO, 12.00 ; MnO, 5.56 ; MgO, 5.90. It will be seen that the specification for the cupola mixture is very rigid, and that the limitations must inevitably result in an increased cost for raw material. At Horde about two-thirds of the lime is added at the begin ning, so that when the metal is nearly dephosphorized the slag can be decanted, after which the rest of the lime can be put in and the final dephosphorization effected by a purer slag. The first cinder, which is rich in phosphorus and poor in iron, is fit for agricultural purposes, while the second, which is poorer in phosphorus and richer in iron, can be used in the blast-furnace. The calorific equation of the basic converter may be calculated by the same method that was used in the work on the acid pro cess (see Table 26). The values of silicon, carbon, and iron remain the same, but it will be assumed in Table 31 that the iron contains 0.50 per cent, silicon, and 1.5 per cent, phos phorus, and that 4.0 per cent, of iron is burned to useful purpose. Of the total production of 114,246 calories, the phosphorus * The Basic Bessemer Steel Plant of The Pottstown Iron Company. Trans. A. I. M. JE., Vol. XXI, p. 743. + Trans. A. I. ME., Vol. XXI, p. 232."], [118, "90 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. contributes 54,296, or very nearly one-half, and, in spite of cutting down the silicon, the basic iron develops fifty per cent. more heat than was found in the calculation for the acid pro cess (viz.: 77,000). A large part of this increase comes from the supposition that 4 per cent, of iron is burned, which is twice as much as was taken for the former calculation. In both cases the figure is an estimate, but it is well known that the basic process gives from 12 to 15 per cent, waste, against 10 per cent, for acid work. This difference arises partly from the phosphorus, but it is also due in some measure to the much greater volume of slag which demands a proportionate supply of oxide of iron, and this metal, so entering the cinder, gives the whole heat of its combustion to the bath. It is the general practice to use a pig-iron containing one or two per cent, of manganese, and between two and three per cent, of phosphorus, and such a pig would produce a still hot ter blow than the one above given, but it is assumed that, if a basic plant were worked up to its capacity, the phosphorus content could be reduced just as in acid work the percentage of silicon has been cut down far below what was once deemed necessary. The basic vessel, however, must always demand a greater development of energy in order to allow for the melt- ing of the lime additions. Table 31. Calorific Equation of the Basic-Bessemer Process.

Sec 51. \u2014 Recarburization. \u2014 Recarburization is the greatest problem of the basic-Bessemer process, for at the end of the operation the metal contains much more oxygen than an acid bath, while the slag, instead of being viscous and inactive, is tery liquid and has a certain amount of loosely held oxide of lal Combustion of 5 kilos, of Silicon develop (see Table 26) Combustion of 35 kilos, of Carbon develop (see Table 26) Combustion of 40 kilos, of Iron develop (see Table 26) .

In making rail steel by the use of melted spiegel, this oxygen in metal and slag gives a very violent reaction with the carbon of the recarburizer, and the carbonic oxide which is formed reduces a considerable amount of phosphorus from the slag. This action is plainly shown in Table 28, when the content of phosphorus was raised in the case of \"pig-iron No. 1\" from .087 before recarburization to .145 in the finished product, this latter figure being much too high for good rail steel. The violence of the carbon reaction may be modified in some measure by adding ferro-silicon before the spiegel is put in, so that the oxygen may be taken up by an element which produces no gas. When making soft steel by the addition of solid ferro-man ganese, the rephosphorization is less, but it is still a trouble some factor. In \"pig-iron No. 2,\" Table 28, the silicon is low in the pig, and the slag is rich in bases, yet the phos phorus in the metal was raised from .061 to .084 per cent., giving a content which is too high for the softest grades. In considering these figures, it must be remembered that Dr. Wedding is not making an argument against the basic Bessemer process ; on the contrary, his position would natur ally make him its official champion, so that the data in Table 28 may be rightfully cited as fair and representative results of the practice in Germany at a time when this method of manu facture had been in general use for many years. There have been improvements in later times, and such records could hardly be published to-day as evidence of high excellence. Rephosphorization is now controlled in great measure by keeping the temperature of the metal as low as possible, by using a very calcareous cinder, and by chilling the slag before pouring, so that it can not so readily mix with the steel. This presupposes, however, such a measure of dependence upon personal supervision of every charge? and such perfect control over the working conditions, that uniform success seems too much to expect. The case of the basic-Bessemer process was ably defended by Joseph Hartshorne* in the discussion of my paper on \"Specifications on Structural Steel,\" but some of the in stances cited by him as proof of good practice are open to * Trans. Am. Soc. Civil Eng. Vol. XXXIII, p. 384."], [120, "92 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTITRAL STEEL. criticism. Thus it is stated that the Rothe Erde Works made 61 heats on one contract, all of which \"showed phosphorus between .023 and .093 per cent.\" In another case the same works made 700 heats, of which 303 were below .06 per cent. in phosphorus, while 67 heats contained between .08 and .10 per cent. This would hardly be considered good work in America, where manufacturers keep their product within much closer limits. Moreover, careful railroad engineers would refuse to accept steel containing over .08 per cent, of phosphorus, while rivet steel is often required to show less than .04 per cent, of this element, it being understood in both cases that the metal is made by the acid process. In the use of basic open-hearth steel, a maximum limit of .04 per cent, of phosphorus is not uncommon for plates and angles."], [121, "93 CHAPTER VIII. THE OPEN-HEARTH FURNACE. Section 52. \u2014 General description of a regenerative furnace. \u2014 The open-hearth process consists in melting pig-iron, mixed with more or less wrought-iron, steel, or similar iron products, by exposure to the direct action of the flame in a regenerative gas furnace, and converting the resultant bath into steel, the operation being so conducted that the final product is entirely fluid. Regeneration is specified not because it carries any special virtue, but because it is impracticable to obtain the necessary temperature in any other way. The construction of melting furnaces varies in every place, and no one form can be declared perfect, but in all of them the general principles are the same, as well as the methods of producing and controlling the temperature. Where natural gas is used, and in some instances with petroleum, the fuel is not regenerated, but the air is always preheated. The following description will assume that both gas and air undergo the same treatment. In Figures IV and V are given drawings of a very common type of furnace ; its grievous faults will be discussed later, but it may be used to illustrate the method of operation. The gas enters the chamber F, which is surrounded by thick walls and filled with brickwork so laid that a large amount of heating surface is exposed, while at the same time free passage for the gas is assured. The air enters a similar chamber, E. In start ing a furnace the bricks in these chambers are heated before any gases are admitted. With rich fuels, like natural gas, this may not be essential, but ordinary producer gas, when cold, can hardly be burned with air at the ordinary tempera ture, and an attempt to do so may result in serious explosions,"], [122, "94 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. so that it is advisable to heat the furnace by a wood fire until the regenerators show signs of redness. When finally the gas and air are admitted, precautions are taken to avoid explo sions by filling the passages with the waste gases from the wood fire. The first effect of their entrance is to cool the chambers on the incoming end, for noheatis produced until they meet in the port at 0. From this point the flame warms the furnace and also the chambers E\u00ab and _*_, through which the products of combustion pass to the stack. After the brickwork in the first set of chambers has been partially cooled by the incom ing gases, the currents are reversed by means of suitable valves, and the gas and air enter the furnace by way of the chambers __\u00bb and _-_, which, as just stated, have been heated by the products of combustion. It will be evident that on every reversal the temperature of the furnace will be higher, for not only will there be the normal increment due to the con tinued action of the flame which would obtain in any system, but there is another action peculiar to a regenerative con struction, for the gases passing through the chambers are hotter on every change in the currents and, therefore, they will produce a more intense temperature in combustion. Thus in all ways the action is cumulative, and there is a constant increment of heat throughout the whole construction. In the case of a furnace which has an insufficient supply of fuel and which contains a full charge of metal, the increased radiation at high temperatures, together with the absorption of energy by the bath, may automatically prevent the attain ment of too high a heat ; but in a good furnace, and more especially in an empty one, the action is so rapid that the supply of gas and air must be carefully regulated in order that radiation can maintain an equilibrium. This necessary control of temperature also places a limit on the heat of the regenerators, so that they are usually of a temperature of about 1800\u00b0 F. (say 1000\u00b0 C). Dissociation plays no part in the practical operation of a furnace, for, with common producer gas and air, both admitted to the valves at a temperature of about 60\u00b0 F. (16\u00b0 C.), the melting chamber may easily be made hot enough to fuse a very pure sand into viscous porce-"], [123, "THE OPEN-HEARTH FURNACE. 95 lain. One such specimen of fused material, made under rather unusual conditions, showed the following composition in per cent, : Si02, 9S.82 ; A1208, 0.9 ; Fe208, 0.2. Sec 53. \u2014 Quality of the gas required in open-hearth furnaces. \u2014 The system of regeneration, which supplies the furnace with a fuel already raised to a yellow heat, renders unnecessary any stringent specifications regarding the quality of the gas. Ordinary producer gas contains over 60 per cent, of non combustible material, and yet is all that can be desired as far as thermal power is concerned. Certain substances, such :as sulphurous acid and steam, are objectionable, but this arises rather from their chemical action upon the metal than from any interference with calorific development. With coal of ordinary quality sulphur causes no trouble, but when it is present in large amounts it is absorbed by the steel. The presence of steam causes increased oxidation of the metalloids and a greater waste of iron. This oxidation is not always objectionable, since it is sometimes impracticable to obtain sufficient steel scrap, and, if the charge contains an excess of pig-iron, some agent must be used to burn the silicon and carbon. A gas containing hydrogen, l'ike natural gas or petroleum, will be more efficient in this work than a dry carbonic oxide flame, while an excess of steam will make the action still more rapid. Hence it would be possible to use steam in place of ore as an oxidizing agent, but the practice is not to be recommended. If the steam is used during the melting, a considerable pro portion of the oxide of iron which is formed will unite with the silica of the hearth and thus become lost beyond recovery. It is advantageous, therefore, to have no free steam present during the melting of the charge, while after the melting is done the oxygen may be supplied in the form of ore with much more satisfactory results. The metal at the time of tapping should be as nearly as possible in the condition of steel in a crucible during the \"dead melt,\" and this can only be attained by a neutral flame. In spite of the opinions of many metallurgists, such a flame can not be obtained for any length of time, since it has no active calorific power, and even when black smoke is pouring from the stack, the silicon, manganese, carbon, and"], [124, "96 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL.

A carbonic oxide flame can be made more nearly neutral than any other, and hence is more desirable at the end of the operation. Sec 54. \u2014 Construction of an open-hearth furnace. \u2014 In the furnace which is exhibited in Figures IV and V it will be noted that the hearth sits partly upon the arches of the chambers. These arches, during the entire run of the furnace, are at a bright yellow heat and are continually subjected to strains and deformation by the alternating shrinking and expansion of the walls that support them. It is needless to say that a poorer foundation for a furnace would be difficult to conceive, and it is a positive certainty that some day there must be a long stop to make what are called \"general repairs,\" this term being often used to cover the alterations consequent upon defective installation. Yet this drawing is copied from one of our leading trade papers as the design of a firm of metallurgical engineers, and, unfortunately, it is the common type erected by many such firms, both in this country and abroad, who are guided partly by ignorance and partly by the necessity of submitting plans for the cheapest con struction that will work satisfactorily until their responsi bility ceases. Figures VI and VII show a furnace designed by S. T. Wellman for the Illinois Steel Company, Chicago, and illustrate how this question of foundation may be answered by putting the chambers separate from the furnace. The regenerators are vertical as in the former case, the gases on the way to the furnace entering at the bottom and rising upward through the bricks. This construction renders necessary considerable vertical height, so that either the chambers must be sunk to a great depth, or the charging floor of the furnace must be above the general level and all the stock be elevated. It may seem possible to bring the gas down after going through regenerators, but this is bad practice, for the gases should push themselves into the furnace and they tend to travel upward rather than downward. To avoid the cost of elevating the stock, horizontal chambers were devised by H. W. Lash, of Pittsburg. There are objec tions to them, for the tendency of the hot gases is to seek the upper passages and thus the benefit of the full area is not"], [126, "98 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. secured. In vertical chambers, on the contrary, there is an automatic regulation of the currents ; for, if there is a hot place, the ingoing cold gases naturally seek it, and if there is a cold place, the outgoing hot gases find it, and thus there is a constant tendency to equalization and to the highest erfi- Vlew of Longitudinal Section of Furnace showing Chambers and Ports.

The worst feature of horizontal chambers is the lack of any propelling action upon the gases. With vertical regenerators the hot gas and air rise naturally and force themselves into the furnace, but with hori zontal passages there is only a very slight positive pressure"], [127, "99 the open-hearth furnace. due to the slight uptake near the furnace. The fuel will or should always leave the producer under a slight pressure, so that it will need no further assistance on its way to the furnace, but it is advisable to force the air with a fan blower.

The horizon tal chambers are used to bring the charging floor down to the general level, and the plant is arranged so that narrow and broad-gauge cars run directly in front of the furnace. The air is blown into the chambers by an electric fan. The brick-"], [128, "100 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. work forming the ports is enclosed in iron framework, so built that the whole cage can be changed when the arches are worn out ; this is an improvement introduced by C. E. Stafford, of Pittsburg. The furnace itself is my own design. It is placed upon rockers and is tilted by means of hydraulic cylinders, so that it is possible to have the taphole above the metal, since the heat is poured and not tapped as in all other furnaces. By this change much hard and hot work is avoided, for the only labor connected with the hole is an occasional trim ming or shaping which can be done at any convenient time. It is customary to keep the opening closed on the outside with a little loose material to exclude air, this being raked out about half an hour before the operation is finished so that the charge can be poured into the ladle when desired. The advantage of this ability to tap instantly will be appreciated in the case of special steels, and particularly in making steel castings when great accuracy in composition is required. The absence of a taphole is of value for other reasons, for it becomes possible to pour the entire charge into a ladle and then tap the metal back into the furnace, leaving the slag in the ladle. This practice may be employed in acid or basic prac tice to get rid of the voluminous slag produced in the pig-and ore process, or it may be used in basic work to remove a very sulphurous, a very phosphoritic, or a very silicious slag, and by thus giving an opportunity for the construction of a new clean cinder, allow a more impure raw material than can be used under any other system. It may also be of great advan tage in the transfer of metal from an acid to a basic furnace, or vice versa. This idea, which has been proposed numberless times, has always been considered impracticable, but at the plant of the Pennsylvania Steel Company it has been carried out without difficulty, and acid steel can be regularly made with from .010 to .015 per cent, of phosphorus, no appreciable chilling of the charge occurring in the transfer. Sec 56. \u2014 Method of charging a tilting furnace. \u2014 One of the most important points connected with the tilting furnace is the economy of labor in charging. At most works the stock is put in by hand, and the work is of the most exhausting character. Charging machines have been devised, but they are very expensive, and there are practical difficulties and costs"], [129, "101 THE OPEN-HEARTH FURNACE. connected with the preparatory handling and arrangement of the stock, with the wear of the charging buggies, and with the destruction of the jambs of the charging doors. The furnace above described may be tilted so that the stock can be dropped into the doors from dump-buggies, and by the nature of the case these buggies need not be exposed to intense heat ; they may be loaded with scrap at the shears of the rolling mills, and raised and discharged at the furnace by an hydraulic crane. The hearths of both basic and acid furnaces, after the first charge, are as hard as rock, and are not affected by the fall of the most massive pieces of scrap. Figure X is a sketch of the furnace when tilted, showing the method of charging by dump bugsies. View of Cross Section of Furnace Showing Charging Apparatus. Fig. X. \u2014 Method of Charging a Tiltlng Furnace It will occur to manj* furnacemen that the back wall may be injured by the stock, but this is prevented by making this wall in the same way as the hearth, by tilting the furnace as far as it will go, and \" setting\" thin layers of acid or basic material. This wall is, therefore, continuous with the hearth, as shown in Figure X, and, being more infusible and harder than the best of brick, it is never newly rebuilt except when it is necessary to remove the entire hearth."], [130, "102 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. During the operation of the furnace this back wall wears away to some extent, since it is covered with slag during the tapping. This condition arises from the fact that it is not advisable to decant the slag and metal together, owing to the more violent reaction in the ladle. The furnace is, therefore, tilted, at the beginning of the pour, to such an extent that the slag is above the taphole, and the steel is all drawn off before the cinder. Thus there is a certain amount of scorification of the back wall, but it can be easily repaired when necessary, say once in two weeks, by tipping the furnace and patching in the same way as the rest of the bottom is repaired. The \" setting\" of this patchwork must be conducted while the furnace is tipped over to its full extent, else the material will not stay upon such a steep slope, but will run down into the bottom. In order that this can be done, it is necessary that the construction be such that the flame can be kept upon the furnace, no matter in what position it may be. Such an arrangement is of great advantage for other reasons, since it is often convenient to tilt the furnace in order to keep the bath from frothing out the doors, or to drain and patch a hole in the bottom. Moreover, if the practice of dumping the stock be followed, it is necessary that the gas be kept on the furnace while charging, otherwise the cooling would be excessive. These conditions render it strongly advisable that there shall be an adjustable connection between the furnace and the ports. This is accomplished by the abutting of two water cooled cast-iron rings (marked CC in Figure VIII), one being fastened to the furnace and the other to the ports. The center of the hole in these rings is the centej* of rotation of the fur nace, and therefore the aperture remains open in all positions of the hearth. Sec 57. \u2014 Ports of an open-hearth furnace. \u2014 The working *^f the furnace depends very much upon the arrangement of the ports through which the gases come and go. The gas should enter below the air because, being lighter, mixture is facili tated, and also because this arrangement does not expose the metal on the hearth to a stratum of hot air and cause exces sive oxidation. The point where the two gases meet should be about five feet from the metal ; if much less than this, com bustion can hardly begin before it is checked by contact with"], [131, "THE OPEN-HEARTH FURNACE. 103 the cold stock ; if much more, and if the burning mixture is conducted between confining walls, the brickwork will be rapidly melted. , \u25a0 Both gas and air should enter the combustion chamber under a positive pressure, forcing them into contact with each other and throwing the resultant flame across the furnace in such a way that the draught of the stack on the outgoing end can pull it down through the ports without its impinging upon the roof. A prevalent idea among furnacemen is that the draught of the stack pulls the gases into the furnace, but this is entirely wrong. They are not pulled ; they are pushed in by the upward -force of the white-hot vertical port on the incoming end, and it has been explained that where this force is not sufficient, as in horizontal chambers, a blower should be used as an auxiliary. Much has been written about building the roof of the fur nace very high and keeping the flame away from the stock, it being supposed that combustion is thereby aided and the heating done more economically by radiation. The suggestion of a high roof is a very good one, as it prevents the cutting of that portion of the furnace ; but, contrary to what seems a common impression, such a construction is not necessarily synonymous with heating by radiation. When the ports are properly built and the gases well controlled, the melting is hastened by having the flame strike down upon the stock, although, probably, the oxidizing influence is more powerful. Sec 58. \u2014 Valves of an open-hearth furnace. \u2014 The amount of gas and air admitted to the chambers is regulated by some simple form of throttle valve. Reversing apparatus is also necessary, since the course of the currents must be changed at least twice every hour. For this purpose the ordinary butter fly valve is in common use. Its simplicity, the ease with which it is manipulated, the small space it occupies, and its small first cost, have led to its general adoption and to an equally general unwillingness to recognize its radical and irremediable defects. From the nature of the case it is ex posed on one side to the incoming gases, and on the other to the products of combustion. It will sometimes happen that these waste gases are red hot, and the inevitable result is a"], [132, "104 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. warping of the valve or box, and a leak from the gas main in to the chimney.

It is far preferable to spend more money on the installation and put in valves which will last longer and which can be changed in case any warping occurs. Such a construction is shown in Figures XI and XII. It will be noted that there is only one reversing valve, and that, to change currents, this is carried from one seat to the other. Both of these seats are water-cooled, and the valve is always in contact with a cold surface and is always under exactly the same conditions. The only ironwork necessary is a cast-iron cover-plate with a long slot and a small buggy and chain, which, with two seats and one valve, make the cheapest apparatus that can be built. The slot is always open, but the air that is drawn in goes up the stack and is a benefit in cooling the valves. Such an ar-"], [133, "105 THE OPEN-HEARTH FURNACE. rangement may be used for years without the least repair even when oil vapor is used for fuel and red-hot gases escape to the stack.

Sec 59. \u2014 Regulation of the temperature of an open-hearth furnace. \u2014 The temperature of the interior of the furnace and of the metal is estimated by the eye, deep-blue glasses being used as a protection from the intense glare. It is essential that the melter possess considerable skill in this line, for if the metal is too cold it can not be cast, and if too hot it will give bad results. I have elsewhere* shown that the practiced eye can detect a difference of 13\u00b0 C. in the temperature of Bessemer charges, and this may also be taken as the measure of skill to which many open-hearth melters attain. It has been explained that the intense heat of a regenera tive furnace is made possible by the preheating of the gas and air in chambers which have been warmed by the productc of * The Open-Hearth Process. Trans. A. I. M. E., Vol. XXII, p. 392."], [134, "106 manufacture of structural steel. combustion, these chambers being alternately heated by cur rents traveling from the furnace to the valves, and cooled by currents going from the valves to the furnace. If the currents were not reversed, the chambers on the outgoing end would be heated uniformly throughout their length to about tin* temperature of the furnace, while, at the same time, the cham bers on the incoming end would be uniformly cooled to the temperature of the incoming gases. By the reversal of the currents there is a continual conflict between these extremes,. so that in a furnace in good working order the ends next the melting chamber are at a bright yellow heat, and the ends next the valves are about 200\u00b0 F. (say 100\u00b0 C.) above the tem perature of the incoming gases. Air always enters cold, but it is believed by some furnace men that it is economical to have the gas delivered to the valves as hot as possible. To some extent this is an error, for it is certain that the checkers in the outer end of the gas chamber can not possibly be cooled below the temperature of the entering gas, and it is just as certain that the products of combustion escaping to the stack can not possibly be cooled below the temperature of these checkers. Hence it follows that if, during a given time, there is an equal quantity of gaseous matter passing through the chamber in either direc tion, the heat carried in by hotter fuel is carried out by hotter waste gases, and therefore no economy is obtained. With hot gas, however, it is not necessary to pass such a large proportion of the products of combustion through the gas chambers, and an extra amount may be diverted to the air chambers, where the heat may be used to advantage, so that a certain gain accrues. This gain may be quite import ant when the coal contains only a small proportion of the denser hydrocarbons, for, under these conditions, the gas leaves the producer at a high temperature ; but when the coal is very rich in volatile components, the gas is at a very low temperature when it comes from the fire, and the gain from its immediate use may be inappreciable. It is true that all the tar is utilized when hot gas is used, but it will be shown, in Section 67, that this represents only a small part of the total calorific development. Sec 60. \u2014 Calorific equation of an open-hearth furnace. \u2014"], [135, "107 THE OPEN-HEARTH FURNACE. The heat produced by the combustion of the fuel is by no means entirely available in useful work, for it is probable that less than one-eighth of all the energy is consumed in heating and melting the metal upon the hearth. I have elsewhere* recorded the results of an investigation into the distribution of the calorific power in a 24-ton acid furnace, with vertical chambers and a consumption of about 800 pounds of bituminous coal per gross ton of product. Neglecting Sunday work and repairs, the fuel would probably not be over 700 pounds per ton, or an average of 16800 pounds of coal per heat of 24 tons of steel. The operation may be divided into three periods : (1) The period of making bottom and charging. (2) The period of melting. (3) The period of oreing and superheating. It was estimated that 1512 pounds of coal were burned in the first period, and this can be subtracted from the total, because the loss of heat from the open doors is equal to the gain from the fuel burned. This leaves 15288 pounds con sumed in the actual heating, melting, and superheating of the charge, being 637 pounds or 290 kilogrammes per ton. The calorific value of the coal was taken at 8198 calories per kilo, giving a production of 2,377,420 calories per ton. It is shown in Chapter IX of this book that 35.1 per cent, of the value of the coal is lost in the manufacture of gas, leaving available 64.9 per cent, of 2,377,420, or 1,542,950, calories. To this must be added the energy created by the combustion of the silicon, manganese, carbon, and iron of the charge, found by calcu lation to be 143,000 calories per ton, making a total supply of 1,685,950 calories per ton. The products of combustion were about 300\u00b0 C. above the temperature of the entering gas and air, and this will account for 16 per cent, of the total potential heat of the gas, or 246,870 calories. Moreover, the analyses of the gases proved that perfect combustion never occurred ; that either the escaping products contained a certain proportion of unburned fuel, or an excess of air, or both. These condi tions indicate a loss which was put at 4.5 per cent., or 69,430 calories. Calculations on the calorific power theoretically necessary to heat and melt the stock gave about 290,000 * The Physical and s'hemical Equations of the Open-Hearth Process. Trans. A. 1. M. E., Vol. XIX, p. !$\u25a0_"], [136, "108 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTUH \\\\. STEEL. calories per ton. By adding these items together and sub tracting the sum from the total production of heat, the loss from radiation and conduction was found. Table 32 gives a summary on the foregoing basis. It will seem rather extraordinary at first sight that in a regenerative furnace, recognized as the highest type of heat utilization in the combustion of gas, only 17 per cent, of the potential power is used and only 12 per cent, of the value of the coal. Experience demonstrates, however, that it takes very nearly as much fuel to keep an empty furnace at a working temperature as it does to make steel, and this indicates that the general truth of the result is not open to question. The consumption of fuel, in the foregoing calculation, has been assumed to be 700 pounds of coal per ton of product for the actual time of operation. In some of the more modern furnaces this has been reduced to 600, and even to 500 pounds. This result is attained by very large regenerator capacity, and by careful attention to all the details both of producer and furnace practice. In such cases the thermal equation will vary somewhat from the example just given, the greatest change being found in the percentage of heat utilized in melting and heating, while the other factors would probably bear nearly the same relation to one another as when the total loss is greater. A type of construction which has been tried during the last few years*, presents certain possibilities of fuel economy. The fundamental idea is to divert part of the products of combustion, as they pass from the melting chamber, and inject them beneath the grate of the producer. The carbonic acid and steam, contained in these waste gases, are broken up by the glowing coke and converted into carbonic oxide and hydrogen, and a large part of the energy necessary for these reactions will be contributed by the waste gases themselves if they have not been allowed to cool on their way from the furnace to the producer. I am informed by the proprietors of this device that it has given excellent results on the Continent and in England in puddling, heating, and welding furnaces, and that open-hearth plants are now in process of erection. * A New Form of Siemens Furnace. John Head ; Journal I. and S. I., Vol. II, 1889, p. 256. v"], [137, "109 THE OPEN-HEARTH FURNACE. An attractive modification of regenerative construction,. used abroad to some extent, consists in placing the producer very close to the furnace, so that by avoiding all cooling influ ences, the gas may be delivered to the combustion chamber at such a high temperature that regeneration is unnecessary. Under this practice a steam jet can not be used under the grate, for it will lower the temperature of the fire too much for good results, and it is well known that there is a very much greater loss of fuel, time, and labor, in cleaning fires which are run with dry air than when steam is used to rot the clinkers. In some localities, as at Witkowitz, Austria, the nature of the coal allows the use of dry blast, the ash being rendered just so viscous by the heat that it can be removed in a ball from the bottom of the producer, but this is an unusual con dition, and ordinarily the additional loss of fuel through the grates under the above arrangement will counterbalance, to some extent, the gain from the use of hot gas. Table 32. Distribution of Heat in an Open-Hearth Furnace. In the absence of gas regenerators, it will doubtless happen that the air chambers will receive more heat from the furnace than is necessary for the preheating of the air, since all the pro ducts of combustion will pass through them. It will follow that there will be a constant quantity of sensible heat passing away from the regenerative chambers, which may be utilized in the production of steam or in other ways. This surplus heat represents the economy resulting from the direct use of the gas.

In dealing with the metallurgical features? there is a natural division into two kinds of practice. In one the hearth is lined with sand, and the slag is silicious ; in the other, the hearth is made of such material that a basic slag can be carried during the operation. This variation creates two entirely different sets of conditions, and gives rise to systems which are known as The Acid and The Basic Open- Hearth Processes."], [139, "CHAPTER IX. FUEL. Section 61. \u2014 Fundamental equations representing the com bustion of organic fuel. \u2014 A full definition of the word \" fuel,\" and the correlated term \"combustion,\" would necessitate a journey into the domain of chemical physics. Such a disser tation would not be entirely unprofitable, for in the modifica tions of the Bessemer process the calorific value of silicon, manganese, phosphorus, and iron are of vital importance, but in the affairs of everyday life the term \" fuel\" embraces only the various forms of carbon known as charcoal and anthracite coal, and conjunctions of carbon and hydrogen such as natural gas, petroleum, and bituminous coal, while the meaning of \" combustion\" is also narrowed down to the union of such substances with oxygen. In the case of complex hydrocar bons, like wood, soft coal, or oil, the full history of combus tion would be a record of manifold dissociations and syntheses ; but for practical purposes it may be considered that in all compounds of hydrogen and carbon there is an isolation of each element just previous to union with oxygen, and the molecular history may, therefore, be represented by the follow ing simple equations: C-f-20 = C02, 1 kilo C + 2f kilos 0 = 3f kilos C02, producing 8080 calories. co + o = co2, 1 kilo CO + | kilos O =1$ kilos C02, producing 2400 calories. 1 cubic metre CO -f- . cubic metre 0 = 2 cubic metres C02, producing 3000 calories.

It has been questioned whether this latter action ever takes place, the theory being that carbon always burns first to C02 and is then reduced to CO by absorption of incandescent carbon. Whether this is true or not is of little moment, for nothing is gained or lost in calorific energy by the transmutation, and it is, therefore, simpler to assume a direct action. Sec 62. \u2014 Functions of a reverberatory furnace. \u2014 An ordin ary cupola is the most economical user of fuel, the coke or coal being in direct contact with the substance to be melted, but in many operations with iron and steel it is advisable to separate the solid fuel from the metal. For the heating of cold blooms or billets the same general type of reverberatory furnace is used to-day that was used a hundred years ago. In this construction the products of combustion escape at a tem perature considerably higher than that of the metal upon the hearth, so that if a boiler be placed just over the furnace, and the gases pass through it on the way to the stack, the waste heat is quite well utilized during the time that the furnace is at a high temperature ; but when there is a full charge of cold blooms, the combustion chamber is so cold that large volumes of unburned carbon pass through unconsumed. Needless to say that the boiler can not make use of this lost power; on the contrary, it will chill the gases and check whatever combus tion is still progressing in the smoky mixture. This same action occurs whenever fresh coal is put on the fire, the rich hydrocarbons being thrown off in great quantities and passing unburned through the furnace. To avoid these losses, many systems are in use by which air is admitted near the bridge wall, and it is usual to preheat this air by passing it through iron or brick flues, which are warmed by"], [141, "113 FUEL, either the furnace walls, the stack, or the hearth. Theoretic ally this idea is much to be commended, and in practice it often gives good results in an economy of fuel and a hotter flame ; but unless intelligently watched there is a chance for serious mistakes in admitting too little air at the time of poking the fire, and too much air when the evolution of the denser gases is lessened. In the latter condition, sharp tongues of flame may play down upon the stock and waste or overheat the metal, so that many mill managers look upon the loss of unburned fuel as an evil which can be met only by invoking the aid of a greater enemy. When air is used at the bridge, it is plain that the combus tion chamber is a gas furnace, the gas coming directly from a sort of producer, called the fire box, and meeting air at a fixed point. When no air is admitted at the bridge, it is still in some measure a gas furnace, for a little air comes through the bed of coal, creeping along the walls or through the holes in the fire, so that combustion goes on throughout a long soft flame. Such a furnace has an advantage in heating cold stock, as the flame is already burning when it comes over the bridge, and not even the coldest combustion chamber can prevent it from exercising a strong heating effect. In a true gas furnace, on the contrary, the gas contains no active oxygen, and combustion is dependent upon a supply of air, and also upon the maintaining of a certain critical temperature which varies with every gas. Rich gases, like hydrogen or illuminat ing gas, burn at any ordinary temperature when once started, but common producer gas, if thoroughly cold, will hardly keep burning, even when started, if the air is also at a low temperature, so that when a furnace using common producer gas is charged with cold blooms, combustion is greatly retarded. If such a furnace has a great reservoir of heat in regenerative chambers, little trouble will be found with the first charge, or perhaps even with the second or third ; but each one takes from the surplus store, and the working goes from bad to worse. For this reason coal furnaces are gener ally used when cold stock is to be heated ; but when hot metal is to be given a wash heat, or when the most intense tempera ture is desired, a regenerative gas furnace should be employed."], [142, "114 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. The construction of such furnaces was discussed in the last chapter, while the following paragraphs deal with the kinds of gas used in them. Sec 63. \u2014 Use of natural gas as fuel. \u2014 In the favored dis trict lying just west of the Alleghenies in Pennsylvania and Ohio, natural gas has been almost universally used for all kinds of heating from about 1884 until the present time. The composition varies in different wells, but in all cases the gas is made up of members of the paraffine series with not over one-half of one per cent, of carbonic acid (C02) and from 2 to 12 per cent, of nitrogen. By ultimate analysis it gives about 70 per cent, of carbon and 23 per cent, of hydrogen, Avhile, by ordinary methods, it shows from 67 to 93 per cent, of marsh gas, the remainder, when the marsh gas is low, being principally hydrogen. At first this gas was passed through regenerative chambers, but this was discontinued owing to the deposition of soot and to the discovery that sufficient heat was obtained by leading the gas directly to the ports and burning it with air which had been regenerated in the usual manner. With the decrease in the available supply of nat ural gas, and its consequent enhanced value, there is a grow ing tendency to change to other fuel, and crude oil has seemed to be a desirable substitute, not only in the hope of economy over coal, but from the necessity that the producer plant shall occupy the minimum of space, especially in the heart of an industrial city where land is valuable. Sec 64. \u2014 Use of petroleum as fuel. \u2014 Crude oil maybe trans formed into a vapor by atomizing with steam and then super heating the mixture, but unless exposed for some time to a yel low heat it remains a vapor and hence will condense if carried through long, uncovered pipes or introduced into the cold valves of a regenerative furnace. It may be put into the chambers at some point where the temperature is high, and in this way condensation will be prevented as well as the waste heat be utilized. There is also a partial molecular rearrange ment with the steam, but the action is far from perfect, for, after passing through twenty feet of small brick flues at a yellow heat, the product may contain 20 per cent, of free aqueous vapor. The mixture of oil vapor and steam may be"], [143, "FUEL. 115 burned in a muffle, for, after the walls are red hot, there is a reciprocal sustention of heat ; but the use in reverberatory fur naces is very wasteful since the action is very sluggish. Even in regenerative practice a charge of cold stock retards combustion much more with oil than with coal gas, and even when at maximum temperatures, the flame is longer on ac count of there being double work to do before the combustion is complete. Each molecule of oil, as it comes into a hot fur nace, undergoes a process of dissociation, the rich hydrocar bons breaking up under the tension of internal molecular activity. This absorbs heat and thus for an instant the action of disruption lowers the temperature below the point of igni tion. Moreover, as each point of oil explodes, it makes a small balloon of gas, and it takes, a moment for this to become mixed with the air necessary for its combustion. If steam is present its reduction by carbon entails a certain delay. These matters may seem trifling, but they are probably the explanation of the very important fact that, under the usual conditions of furnace operation, a flame from oil vapor is longer than a flame from coal gas. In the burning of clear carbonic oxide, or a mixture of it with nitrogen, there is no preliminary decomposition to be performed, the air being free to immediately touch, and burn the molecules of the fuel. It is impossible to state the comparative economy in the use of coal and oil, since their relative values vary so widely in different localities. It often happens that the freight on fuel is three, four, five, or perhaps ten times its value at the source of supply, and it will be evident, since oil contains so much more calorific power, that the freight per unit of heat value becomes less and less, compared with coal, as the absolute transportation charge increases ; so that if both were to be carried fifty miles, coal might be much the cheaper, while if the distance were a thousand miles, the status would be just the reverse. A rough comparison may always be made by as suming that 50 gallons of oil are equivalent to about 1000 pounds of soft coal when used in regenerative furnaces or under boilers. In the latter case, the success of the practice depends upon the arrangements made to prevent chilling of the flame before vigorous combustion is in progress."], [144, "116 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. Sec 65. \u2014 Use ot water gas as fuel. \u2014 If steam is passed through a bed of incandescent carbon, the following reaction occurs : C-4-H20 = CO + 2H. Both of the resultant products are of the highest value, and this method of manufacturing a gas of intense calorific power has always appeared to the inventive mind a field for profit able inquiry. There are, however, one or two plainly evident difficulties, for the reaction above given calls for a great ab sorption of heat and, therefore, the fire is rapidly cooled. To bring up the temperature again a blast of air is necessary, and then the fire makes only common producer gas containing 60 per cent, of nitrogen, so that the process must be intermittent and the rich and poor gases be collected separately. The most successful apparatus for this work has been devised and developed by Mr. Burdett Loomis, of Hartford, Conn., and his engineer, Mr. Pettibone. In their arrangement soft coal is generally used and the steam is on about half the time, while during the other half combustion is urged by a stream of air pulled downward through the fire. This down-draught prevents the caking of the coal, converts the volatile matter into a fixed gas, and also allows the opening of doors above the fire, giving the best of chance for feeding coal where it is needed and rendering poking unnecessary. The upper part of the fire is hottest, and the steam which is admitted at the bot tom, and which is heated to a high temperature by passing through the lower portions, is completely broken up by meet ing the upper zone of incandescent carbon. The sensible heat of the products is utilized in generating steam to run the plant and no water-cooled valves are needed. The gas made with the air draught can be used for ordinary heating purposes in regenerative furnaces, while the water gas may be burned without preheating, and, being under a posi tive pressure and of high calorific power, can be distributed in small iron pipes. It is especially valuable when the work is intermittent, for in such cases a regenerative furnace is un suitable, since it requires nearly as much fuel to keep it at a maximum temperature when empty as when it is charged) while water gas can be turned on or off as needed, and an intense heat quickly produced."], [145, "117 FUEL. It will be seen that these considerations have no bearing upon regenerative work, for it costs nothing to pass gas through checkers, and it is, therefore, no advantage to have a fuel which does not require such preheating. It is probable that the open-hearth and the rolling mill will continue to use whatever gas furnishes a given number of heat units at the least cost, without regard to the calorific power per unit of weight or volume. Sec 66. \u2014 Use of anthracite coal for making fuel gas. \u2014 Hard coal is admittedly less desirable than coke in the blast-fur nace and cupola, and far inferior to soft coal in the reverbera tory furnace, but when used under boilers it is equal to the bituminous variety both in facility of working and in the quantity required. Anthracite has also been successfully used in the production of gas where high calorific power is not essential, the gaseous products being composed almost wholly of carbonic oxide (CO) and nitrogen. Such a bed of coal, if run by forced draft, becomes unman- ageably hot, so that steam is injected at the grate, and this rots the clinkers, cools the fire, and is decomposed by the carbon as in the manufacture of water gas, but the amount that can be used is limited, an excess lowering the tempera- ture so that much steam passes through unaffected. For the sake of economy the small sizes known as buck- wheat and pea coal are used, special arrangements being introduced to avoid trouble in cleaning fires ; under these conditions a gas may be regularly produced of about the following composition : Per cent, by volume. CO 27.0 H 12.0 CH4 + C,H4 1.2 CO, 2.5 N 57.3 This is nearly the same result that will be obtained in a soft-coal producer, but, when the attempt is made to substi tute the one for the other, it is found that while gas from anthracite is nearly equal in producing low temperatures, such as firing boilers or drying ladles, it is far inferior, if not entirely valueless, in creating an intense heat even when properly regenerated ; it is supposed with much reason that this inferiorit}* lies in the absence of the suspended and vola."], [146, "118 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. tilized tarry matters which are characteristic of soft-coal gas. These components have quite an appreciable heating value, but their main function is to give luminosity to the flame and, by increasing its power of radiation, augment enor mously its practical value. This point is taken up more fully in the consideration of the Siemens producer. Sec 67. \u2014 Use of bituminous coal for making fuel gas. \u2014 The conversion of soft coal into gas is performed by burning it in a thick fire and collecting the gases evolved. One of the most common devices to carry out this work is the Wellman modi fication of the old Siemens producer, a drawing of which is given in Figure XIII. In a group of such fires all discharge into the common tube N; but aside from this each is built inde pendent, being surrounded by a circular shell of steel, insuring a permanent preservation of the shape of arches and walls, and rendering impossible a leakage from one fire to another. Air is blown in beneath the grate to force combustion, and a jet of steam is also admitted to keep down the temperature and prevent the formation of clinkers. It will be seen in Figure XIII that the body of the producer is divided into unequal zones, marked A, B, and C The divi sion A represents the layer of ashes, varying in thickness from nothing to three feet. This layer must be taken into account in estimating the actual depth of the fire. The zone B is the region of combustion where the air meets glowing carbon and forms carbonic acid (C02), and this, rising through the bed of coal, absorbs more carbon and becomes carbonic oxide (CO ), but this action is never complete and some carbonic acid passes through the fire unchanged. With a hot deep fire, free from cavities, the gas may contain as low as 2.5 per cent, by volume of C02, but if the fire be thin, or if it is riddled with holes, there may be as much as 10 per cent. It is also in the \" zone of combustion\" that the steam is broken up by the carbon with formation of hydrogen and carbonic oxide, but, as in the similar reduction of carbonic acid, this reaction is never perfect and some steam always goes through unaltered. The best decomposition is attained in a hot fire, but this is just the condition that is not desirable on account of the formation of clinkers. On the other hand, if the supply of steam be increased indefinitely the fire will"], [147, "119 FUEL. get colder and colder, producing no gas and letting steam and air pass through unconsumed. There is a mean between these extremes which is almost forced upon the operator, wherein the fire is kept at a constant temperature, and in this condi tion there is not much increase in hydrogen from the steam, while, on the contrary, there is quite a little steam passing away with the gases.

Fio. XIII. \u2014 The Wellman* Gas Producer. Vertical Section through Center. In the upper zone of the fire, marked C in the drawing, the volatile hydrocarbons of the fuel are distilled by the heat of the combustion beneath, and in this way the gaseous products contain a certain proportion of tarry vapors, some of which are condensed in the conducting tubes. The zones of combustion and distillation are not separated by any arbitrary line, but a goodly share of the rich components of the coal are carried down into the body of the fire and exposed to a high temperature. This causes the separation of carbon, some of which, staying in the fire, is burned with the coal while the rest is carried for ward into the conducting tube. When the fire is very hot, large volumes of soot are formed in this way and soon give trouble"], [148, "120 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. in the pipes, but when cool there is little soot but much tar. The worst condition is when holes form in the bed of coal. This allows air to come through and burn the hydrocarbons above the fire with a smoky soot-producing flame, cakes the coal into an unworkable mass, and increases the percentage of carbonic acid in the gas. The average gas from a Siemens producer is of the following composition : Siemens Gas. Per cent, by volume. CO, 4.5 C, H4 0.4 O 0.4 CO 23.0 H 8.0 CH, 8.0 N, by difference 60.7 100.0 It has been shown that some of these percentages, notably of C02, H, and CH4, will vary through wide ranges according to the condition of the fire, but the content of nitrogen will always be about 60 per cent. This component remains passive throughout all the future history of combustion, but it so reduces the calorific intensity that the gas is applicable only to regenerative furnaces. The ordinary methods of gas analysis fail to take definite account of any save true gaseous components, but in the pro ducts of a soft-coal fire there are certain amounts of soot and tar. Some of this material is deposited in the conduits, but this does not constitute a very great part of the total energy. I have elsewhere* recorded that in the case of an exposed 7-foot iron pipe, 250 feet long, the condensation of tar amounted to only three-tenths of one per cent, of the total heat value, while the gas itself, after passing through the tube, contained a proportion that represented from one-tenth to one-eighth of the total heating power. But although this is the result of theoretical calculations, it is found that when the suspended matters are removed by scrubbing, the value of the gas is reduced very seriously, for it is the tar which gives luminosity to the flame and thereby renders it able to heat not only by direct impact, but by the *The Open-Hearth Process.

It is by virtue of this quality that the luminous flames from the dense hydrocarbons so far surpass the clear products of an anthracite fire. Within the last few years, several different types of pro ducer have been proposed, the main object being the preven tion of clinker and the consequent difficulty and expense of cleaning the fire. The most successful way of accomplishing this is by admitting a steam blast through a cone in the center of the fire, thus avoiding all possibility of the air follow ing up the walls. An arrangement of this kind is shown in Figure XIV. Fig. XIV. \u2014 Water-Sealed Gas Producer. In such producers there is often no grate over a part of the base, but the ash is allowed to accumulate in a thick bed at the bottom. In some cases the producer stands in a pan of water, which serves to cool the ashes, and which also seals the base of the apparatus. By shoveling the ash from beneath the surface of the water, the producer may be cleaned with out any interruption of its operation."], [150, "122 CHAPTER X. the acid open-hearth process. Section 68. \u2014 Nature of the charge in a steel-melting furnace. \u2014 In acid open-hearth practice the shell is first lined with nine inches or more of clay brick. The furnace is then heated to nearly the working temperature, and sand is spread in successive layers over the entire hearth. Each layer is heated to a full heat for about ten minutes or until it is \" set\" so as to be hard, the sand being selected so that it will give as dense and solid a bottom as possible. When finished, the thickness of the lining within the shell should be from 18 to 24 inches. The area of the cavity for holding the charge will be deter mined by the size of the furnace, for the depth of the metal should be about 12 to 15 inches in a 5-ton furnace and from 18 to 24 inches when the charge is 30 to 50 tons. If the bath is very shallow, the oxidation is excessive, while if very deep, the rate of melting is slow. The proportions of the constituents of the charge vary in different places. Sometimes pig-iron alone is used, but when scrap can be obtained it forms part of the mixture. It is always necessary, however, to have a certain amount of pig-iron as a source of supply of the foreign elements, which protect the iron from oxidation. The stock must be of known composition as far as sulphur and phosphorus are concerned, for there is no appreciable elimination of these elements, and the finished product will show a percentage equal to the average of the material charged. The content of silicon, manganese, and carbon is not limited by such narrow bounds, for these elements are oxidized during the process and their presence in greater or lesser amounts alters the working of the charge rather than the composition of the product. In the manufacture of soft steel it is the"], [151, "THE ACID OPEN-HEARTH PROCESS. 123 usual practice, when scrap is available, to regulate the propor tion of pig-iron so that the melted bath shall be free from silicon and manganese, and shall contain from three-fourths to one per cent, of carbon. During the elimination of this element, the metal is in a state of continual ebullition, and its temperature and condition, as well as the character of the slag, may be completely controlled in preparation for recarburizing and casting. If too small an amount of pig-iron is used in making up the charge, the molten bath will contain neither silicon, manga nese, nor carbon, and will be viscous and pasty. Such a mass will be oxidized by the flame and the oxide of iron will scorify the bottom. At some furnaces it has been the custom to first charge and melt the pig-iron and then add scrap which has previously been heated in a separate furnace, but this prac tice is expensive and possesses no advantages over the charg ing of the entire heat at one time. Sec 69. \u2014 Chemical history of an acid open-hearth charge during melting. \u2014 The amount of oxidation which takes place during melting is affected by many conditions, being increased by the presence of hydrogen in the gas, by a sharp flame, and by a port construction that allows free air to impinge upon the metal. It is also determined in great measure by the manner in which the stock is charged. The pig-iron should be spread as evenly as possible over the scrap, so that it will melt first and trickle over the hot steel, and thus each atom of iron will be protected by the contiguity of an atom of silicon or carbon for which the oxygen has a greater affinity. Practically it is impossible to obtain perfect protection, and when only a small proportion of pig is used there will be spots where the scrap is entirely uncovered, and in these places large amounts of iron oxide will be produced. If this cinder forms a pool on the viscous surface of the charge, it will be mixed sooner or later with high-carbon metal, and an inter change will occur with reduction of iron, the result being the same as if mixture had taken place at an earlier stage. But if the fused oxide comes in contact with the hearth, scorification will ensue with formation of silicate of iron, and though at a later period this scoria may be mixed with high-carbon metal, the harm can not be completely remedied. A portion"], [152, "124 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. of the iron may, perhaps, be reduced and a higher silicate be formed, but silica once having entered the slag is there to stay, and will permanently hold a greater or less amount of iron oxide. The value of the elements found in pig-iron in protecting the scrap from oxidation will be in proportion to- their ability to unite with oxygen. Calculating this we have the following table : 1 unit of carbon combines with 1.388 units of oxygen to form CO. 1 unit of silicon combines with 1.143 units of oxygen to form SiO,. 1 unit of manganese combines with 0.291 units of oxygen to form MnO. 1 unit of titanium combines with 0.176 units of oxygen to form TiO,. This table represents a very broad truth, but it must not be translated too literally, for some elements are preferable to others. It is necessary that after melting the metal should be protected from the flame by a layer of slag containing about 50 per cent, of silica. If the charge is made up of one quarter pig-iron carrying one per cent, silicon, the silica produced by oxidation, the sand attached to the pig-iron, and the material derived from the scouring of the hearth, are usu ally sufficient for the requirements of the cinder, but with very low-silicon pig-iron, free from adhering sand, it may be necessary to add additional silica to prevent the basic slag from making inroads upon the bottom. On the contrary, if the Table 33. Elimination of Metalloids in an Open-Hearth Charge. silicon in the pig-iron is very high, the slag will be viscous and infusible.

The way in which the metalloids are eliminated during the melting will be best understood from the typical records given in Table 33. Each column represents the average of a group of consecutive charges ; Group I includes nineteen heats melted with soft-coal producer gas, and Group II six heats made with oil vapor. It will be seen that the oil vapor is much more oxidizing than the coal gas, so that although the original charge was very much higher in oxygen-absorbing elements, the bath after melting had about the same composition in both cases. The slag shows a great variation in the oxides of iron and manga nese ; this arises from the fact that the amount of manganese was limited by the content in the charge, and since the slag required a certain proportion of bases, the deficit was made up by oxidation of iron. Sec 70. \u2014 Chemical history of an acid open-hearth charge after melting. \u2014 After the melting it is necessary to oxidize the remaining carbon, manganese, and silicon, by keeping the bath at a high heat and adding iron ore in successive doses, thus forming silica and oxide of manganese which go into the slag, and carbonic oxide which escapes with the flame. This combustion of carbon produces a bubbling over the entire surface of the bath, continually exposing the metal to the flame, and aiding materially in keeping it at a high tempera ture. The union of the oxygen of the ore with the silicon and carbon sets free metallic iron which is immediately dis solved by the bath. If the ore is added properly, it is reduced as fast as it is put in, as will be evident from Table 34, which shows the history of the metal and the slag in the groups above considered. In Group I an average of 1020 pounds of ore was used on each heat to decarburize, while on Group II only 850 pounds was added. It will be seen that in spite of the addition of the ore the character of the slag remains unchanged. There is an in crease of FeO, but this does not show an increase in basicity, for the volume of slag is increasing throughout the operation both from the wear of the hearth and the silica from the ore, so that in order that the composition of the slag should re main absolutely the same it would be necessary that there be a simultaneous supply of exactly the right proportions of"], [154, "126 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. both MnO and FeO. It is evident that this can not happen, for the metal after melting is nearly free from manganese, and since the ore contains none there is no source of supply of this element. With the dilution of the slag, therefore, there is a vacancy left for a base, and iron oxide is the only available candidate. That this is the true explanation will be seen from the totals of MnO and FeO, which show that the slag at the end of the operation is almost identical with the slag after melting, since the sum of these factors represents the real basicity of the cinder. Table 34. History of Metal and Slag in an Acid Open-Hearth Furnace. Sec 71. \u2014 Quantitative calculations on acid open-hearth slags. \u2014 The foregoing results are purely qualitative, and they do not show the alteration in the amount of the slag which takes place during the progress of the operation. It will lie evident that it is out of the question to actually weigh the cinder at dif ferent periods, but, nevertheless, it is possible to approach the truth by the following method : The final slag, after tapping, is weighed when cold. By subtracting from this weight the MnO produced by the addition of the recarburizer and the sand derived from the taphole and ladle-linings, the amount of slag which was in the furnace before tapping may be com puted. Given the analysis of the slag at that time, it is easy to calculate the weight of its various constituents, among which will be the manganese ; if the ore contained no appre ciable quantity of this element, the amount which in one form or another was present throughout the operation will be known ; and since the percentage of manganese in the slag and in the metal can be determined by analysis, and the Compositl m, per cent.

With this determina tion as a basis, the quantitative estimation of the factors is a matter of simple arithmetic. This process applied to the two groups of heats in Table 34 gives the results shown in Table 35. This shows that although nearly twice as much pig-iron was added in Group II, as re corded in Table 33, the greater oxidizing power of the oil flame took care of this extra amount, the result being plainly seen in the greater quantity of slag which was present after melting. When the bath was thoroughly fluid, the oil flame still acted more powerfully, but it was unable to burn any of the iron since the metalloids furnished ample protection, and the in crease in the weight of slag during oreing is no greater in the one group than in the other. In Group I, 41 per cent, of the Table 35. Calculation on the Weight of Certain Open-Hearth Slags Mentioned in Table 34 and the Amount of FeO Reduced During Oreing. ore was reduced, while in Group II there was 45 per cent. These figures have no general significance, for, if the slag is slightly viscous after melting, a certain amount of ore will be necessary to confer fluidity and will not be reduced. Since this quantity will be a constant under given conditions no mat ter how much ore is afterward needed, it will be evident that it might be 90 per cent, of a small addition and only 10 per cent, of a large one. Sec 72. \u2014 Beduction of iron ore when added to an acid open hearth charge. \u2014 This reduction of ore is a matter of vital importance in using large proportions of pig-iron.

Sec 73. \u2014 Pig-and-ore process. \u2014 The amount of ore required for a charge will not follow closely the amount of carbon, since the flame is constantly at work, and ore is added when the melter thinks it advisable rather than when it is abso lutely necessary. If the charge is hot it dissolves the ore rapidly and there is little chance for the flame to do its share of oxidation, while if the charge is cold only a small amount of ore will be added and the oxygen will be derived from the gases. Thus any attempt to make an arbitrary equation of the action must fail, but it may be broadly said that if the bath contains one per cent, of carbon, 1500 pounds of ore may be used in bringing it down to .08 per cent. The first 500 pounds will reduce it to about .80 per cent, of carbon, the sec ond to .40 per cent, and the third will finish the work. If sili con and manganese should be as low during the interval between the first and second ore additions as at a later time, the burning of the carbon might be the same then as later, but either the presence of these protectors or the less favor able physical condition of the slag in a high-carbon bath retards the action at the start. \"When large quantities of high-silicon or high-manganese pig-iron are used, the first additions of ore are consumed by the unburned excess of these elements, and hundreds and even thousands of pounds of ore may be added after melting before the carbon is affected. Therefore, when it is necessary to charge nothing but pig-iron, it is advisable to have it contain as little silicon as possible, and even then the oxidation of carbon requires several hours. The ore is not lost, for the reduced iron makes up for the metalloids which are burned, so that the weight of the steel will nearly equal the weight of the pig-iron charged. The expense of the pig-and-ore process rests in the slow combustion of carbon, for it is impossible to hurry the work without causing violent boiling of the voluminous slag, pro ducing scorification of the hearth and possibly a loss of metal through the doors. Since the fuel consumption per hour is nearly the same during the period of oreing as it is during"], [158, "130 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. the period of melting, it is plain that there is a considerable decrease in product with an increased fuel ratio. By the use of a tilting furnace this difficulty may be lessened, for as soon as the silicon has been oxidized, the contents of the furnace may be emptied into the ladle and then the metal be immediately returned to the furnace with as little slag ;i desired. When most of the slag is thus removed, the action is much more rapid and there is no trouble from frothing. The tapping of slag from stationary hearths has always resulted unsatisfactorily, and the same is true of attempts to remove it from a tilting furnace by surface decantation, but this process of repouring requires no handling save the raising of the ladle in a vertical line so as to allow the metal to be returned to the furnace through the same hole from which it has just been tapped, and seems to solve the question of slag removal in a simple way. Sec 74. \u2014 Conditions modifying the character of the product. \u2014 If the temperature of the metal is very high, the last traces of silicon will not be oxidized, for the affinity of silicon for oxygen is a function of the temperature. In the Bessemer converter the metal may contain as much as one per cent, of silicon if blown sufficiently hot, but in the open-hearth there is no chance for the bath to arrive at an intense degree of heat as long as a considerable percentage of this element is pres ent ; for superheating is not readily attained without a lively bath, and the bath will very seldom be lively as long as it holds a high content of silicon. Thus the open-hearth can not rival the converter in producing high-silicon metal by non-combustion, but under suitable conditions the amount carried along in the metal may be quite appreciable, and, by holding the bath at a very high temperature with a silicious slag, there will even be a reduction of the silica of the hearth according to the equation Si02-4-2C = Si + 2CO. This variation in affinity of Si for O plays an important part in the production of steel castings where a higher tem perature is used than for ingots of ordinary size. The constant presence of a small proportion of silicon, due to the high temperature, tends to prevent the absorption of"], [159, "131 THE ACID OPEN-HEARTH PROCESS. gases, and it is stated by Odelstjerna* that if at any time the metal is allowed to cool so that the last traces of silicon are burned, the gases which are absorbed can not be expelled by a subsequent superheating. I am of the opinion that Odelstjerna is correct in his state ments, but that there may be other factors involved in a full explanation. It is certain that in the manufacture of small ingots which are to be rolled directly into plates, there are delicate adjustments of temperature and slag that are not easily explained by considering the history of silicon alone. One of these factors, which may be cited by way of illus tration, is the extent and force of the oxidizing influence. It is the opinion of some metallurgists that the best quality of open-hearth steel can only be made when the burning of the metalloids is carried on at a very slow rate, so that the bath shall not contain an excess of oxygen at any time, and it is stated by Ehrenwerthf that a certain American works makes a practice of keeping a charge in the furnace a very long time when a very good quality of steel is desired. As a matter of fact, the works in question did carry out such a system at one time out of respect to foreign tradition, but found no advan tage in so doing, and has long since discontinued the practice. It is also an opinion, held by men of acknowledged reputa tion, that a high proportion of pig-iron in the original charge will give a superior product. If this is true, it probably arises from the fact that the presence of a high proportion of carbon after melting, with the consequent long exposure to the flame, will result in a thorough Avashing of the bath. I believe that there is a limit to this action, and that very little can be gained by raising the content of carbon in the melted bath above one per cent., for this proportion insures a vigorous boil. It is difficult to see how the condition of the bath, after it has been run down from one per cent, of carbon to three-tenths of one per cent., can be any different from the condition which would have existed if the original content had been two per cent. It would seem probable that one or two hours of exposure of the * Trans. A. I. M. E., Vol. XXIV, p. 308. Berg- und Huttenwesen aus der JVeltausstellung in Chicago. Ehrenwerth, 1895, p. 276."], [160, "132 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. completely liquid bath to the flame would give ample oppor tunity for any reactions which could be in progress, and the old adage that \" enough is as good as a feast\" might be applied to the present case. It is not unprofitable, however, to con sider the conclusions from practical experience, however invalid they may appear, for they may sometimes represent a vital truth, albeit our point of view may not be high enough to allow a complete survey of the field. Sec 75. \u2014 History of sulphur and phosphorus. \u2014 In the above records no account is taken of sulphur or phosphorus, but numerous determinations and universal experience prove that the content of phosphorus in the steel will be determined by the initial content in the charge. It is true that acid open hearth slag may contain some phosphorus, and I have found one case where it held 0.04 per cent., but it would require a higher percentage than this to make a difference in the metal that could be detected by ordinary analysis, so that for prac tical purposes it must be assumed that every molecule of phosphorus that is present in the pig-iron, scrap, and ore, will appear in the finished metal. The percentage of sulphur can not be predicted with so much precision. Traces of this element may be burned during melting and pass away as sulphurous anhydride, but the pro portion thus eliminated is small. On the other hand, there is a tendency to absorb sulphur from the flame. With fairly good coal this increment may be neglected, but with bad coal, and especially when the slow working of the furnace renders it necessary to expose the charge to the gases for a long time, the amount thus absorbed may be ruinous. It has been suggested with some reason that the presence of lime in the coal might retain at least a part of the sulphur in the ashes of the pro ducer, so that it would not appear in the gas. The ore is another source of contamination, for it generally contains a certain proportion of pyrites. As the ore floats on the surface of the bath, some sulphur may be oxidized above the surface and the products pass away with the flame, but the remainder will be absorbed by the bath. Sec 76. \u2014 Method of taking tests. \u2014 The condition and nature of the metal and slag are determined from time to time by taking samples from the furnace by means of a small ladle and"], [161, "133 THE ACID OPEN-HEARTH PROCESS. \u2022casting test-ingots with a cross-section about one inch square. These are chilled in water and broken, and the carbon is esti mated from the appearance of the fracture. The reliability of such a determination depends upon the constancy of the conditions of casting and chilling, and the expertness of the judge, but, roughly speaking, the content can be ascertained within 10 per cent, of the true amount. Sec 77. \u2014 Becarburization. \u2014 When the desired point has been reached the recarburizer is added, this being almost invari ably used in a solid state. It is generally heated red hot, but this is not essential, for, in making structural steel, \" ferro'' containing 80 per cent, of manganese is used almost exclu sively, and the weight of the addition is so small that it chills the bath only slightly. The ferro may be added to the metal while in the furnace, and this method has the advantage that the bath can be thoroughly stirred after the recarburizer has melted, but it has the disadvantage that during the time the last pieces are fusing, the portions which melted first are losing their manganese to the oxygen of the slag and flame. In a hot furnace this action is very rapid, and although the entire addition may melt in less than a minute, a considerable proportion of manganese is lost by oxidation. When the recarburizer is added in the ladle, it is evident that the latter action will not occur, but there will be a certain loss on account of the oxide of iron contained in the metal, and which it is the function of the recarburizer to remove. This loss will be the same whether the addition is made in the furnace or in the ladle ; but the effects of slag and flame are absent. Hence it follows, all other things being equal, that the loss will be more regular when recarburization is per formed in the ladle, and this is equivalent to saying that the content of manganese in the steel can be made more nearly alike throughout a series of heats. The amount of manganese lost in recarburization not only varies with the way in which it is added, but also with the carbon of the bath and with the percentage of manganese put in. As would naturally be supposed, the amount of oxide in the bath is less with high than with low carbons, and so the loss in recarburizing decreases as higher steel is made. It is also found that the loss is less with smaller percentages of manga-"], [162, "134 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. nese, so that with the same bath, if 1.00 per cent, of Mn be added, there will be .60 per cent, in the metal, being a loss of .40 per cent., while if .60 percent, be added the steel will have .40 per cent., being a loss of only .20 per cent. It seems as if with the lower manganese the action was not perfect, and that with each successive increment of ferro an additional atom of oxygen is removed. This fact holds good whether the recarburizer is added in the furnace or in the ladle. The fear of non-homogeneity under the practice of adding the ferro in the ladle is not entirely unfounded when small heats are made and the metal is not very hot. But when charges of 20 to 50 tons of hot steel are properly poured and recarburized, the steel is thoroughly uniform. When metal is made very high in manganese, certain precautions must be taken, but in ordinary structural steels, when the manganese runs below .65 per cent., there is an all-pervading action throughout the melted mass which dispels all thought of non-homogeneity. Sec 78. \u2014 Advantages of the open-hearth process in securing homogeneity. \u2014 In the low steel of the Bessemer process there is very little trouble from irregular distribution, although the more viscous slag sometimes holds pieces of the solid recarbu rizer and keeps them from melting until the steel is nearly all poured. The result is that when they do finally fuse, small streams of high manganese metal flow down into the upper part of the last ingot and form a hard spot in the steel. This does not and should not often happen, and most Bessemer soft steel is uniform throughout. In making high-carbon steel, however, the conditions of manufacture make the hearth far superior to the converter. The metal in the Bessemer process is always blown until nearly all the carbon is eliminated, since it has been found impracticable to stop the operation at any definite intermediate point. All the carbon content of the steel, therefore, must be added in the recarburizer, and abso lutely perfect homogeneity can only be secured by absolutely perfect mixing. In the open-hearth, on the other hand, high carbon steels are made by interrupting the process at the desired stage, and it is plain that no mixing is required as far as carbon is concerned, and about the same quantity of recar burizer will be used for a given manganese whether high or low steel is being made."], [163, "135 CHAPTER XI. THE BASIC OPEN-HEARTH PROCESS. Section 79. \u2014 Construction ofa basic open-hearth bottom. \u2014 The basic process, as herein discussed, consists in melting a charge of pig-iron, or a mixture of pig-iron and low-carbon metal, upon a hearth of dolomite, lime, magnesite, or other basic or passive material, and converting it into steel in the presence of a stable basic slag by the action of the flame, with or without the use of ore, and by the addition of the proper recarburizers, the operation being so conducted that the pro duct is cast in a fluid state. In the above specification that the slag shall be stable, no recognition is accorded that hybrid practice wherein a little lime is thrown into an acid furnace, near the end of the opera tion, with the intention of removing a part of the phosphorus by the temporary and uncertain action of a partially basic slag. Regular metallurgical results can only be obtained under regular conditions, and to this end the hearth should be made of material that will not be scorified by basic additions. The current belief that the lining of the bottom is the dephosphoriz ing agent is a complete mistake, for the highest function of the hearth is to remain unaffected and allow the components of the charge to work out their own destiny. In practice it is never possible to construct either an acid or a basic bottom so that it is entirely passive, for a slag which is viscous with silica will slowly attack a pure sand bottom, and a cinder which is mucilaginous with lime will gradually eat into a dolomite hearth. For the construction of a permanent bottom, carbon, bauxite, lime, chromite, magnesite, and dolomite, have been used. Magnesite gives the best results but it is very costly,"], [164, "136 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. and well-burned dolomitic limestone answers well enough. In some places the stone is used in its natural state, but this is a doubtful economy, the better plan being to thoroughly roast it in special kilns and then grind and mix with tar. The roof and walls being made of silica bricks, it is necessary to have a joint of chromite or other passive material between the acid and the basic work ; but it must be understood that at the intense heat of a melting furnace, and in an atmosphere charged with spray of iron oxide, almost any two substances will unite if pressed together, so that the part of the joint which bears the weight of the superposed brickwork must be shielded from the direct action of the flame. Sec 80. \u2014 Functions of the basic additions. \u2014 Given a hearth capable of resisting the action of metal and slag, the problem of the basic furnace is the melting and decarburization of iron as in acid practice, with the additional duty of removing a reasonable quantity of phosphorus and some sulphur. Under the oxidizing influence of the flame and ore, the phos phorus is converted into phosphoric acid (P2Ob) which can unite with iron oxide, but the conjunction will be only tem porary, for the carbon of the bath reduces the iron, leaving the acid helpless, and then the phosphorus in its turn is robbed of its oxygen and returned to the bath. But if lime is added, the acid can form phosphate of calcium, and since the oxide of this element can not be reduced by the carbonic oxide, the phosphorus is never left without a partner, but forms part of a stable cinder. This oxide of calcium is sometimes added in the form of com mon limestone, the carbonic acid being expelled in the furnace. It will be evident that this entails a considerable absorption of heat, and the melting must be delayed accordingly, but it has a compensating advantage in that the gas, in bubbling through the metal, keeps up a motion which facilitates chemical action, and also that the carbonic acid gives up part of its oxygen to the silicon, phosphorus, carbon, and iron. This oxidizing action allows the use of a greater proportion of pig-iron, and also aids in the removal of phosphorus, so that there seems to be good ground for using the cheap natural stone. It is believed, however, to be more economical to put it through a preliminary roasting and reduce by nearly 50 per"], [165, "137 THE BASIC OPEN-HEARTH PROCESS. cent, the amount of basic addition, for the rate of melting is thereby hastened, while the oxidizing effect can be obtained by the use of ore. It is true that ore costs more than stone, but, on the other hand, its full value is returned in metallic iron, and, moreover, it is possible to use a greater proportion of pig-iron on account of the reduced quantity of gas evolved, for the amount of oxidation done during melting, either by stone or ore, is limited by the frothing of the stock, and this is evidently determined by the amount of gas evolved in the reactions. Therefore, if ore produces less gas than stone in oxidizing a given quantity of carbon, then more pig can be used with ore than with stone. The reactions are as follows : Limestone, CaC03 + C = 2 CO + CaO. Ore, Fe20, + 3C = 3C0 + 2 Fe. Thus two volumes of gas are formed for each atom of carbon when stone is used, while only one volume is produced with ore. The available oxygen in the ore is nearly twice as much as in the same weight of stone, so that by using a mixture of 500 pounds of burned lime and 500 pounds of ore, there will be the same quantity of basic earth, and the same oxidizing effect, as with 1000 pounds of raw stone, while there will be only half as much gas produced with a contribution of 300 pounds of metallic iron, and much less refrigerating effect. Sec 81. \u2014 Use of ore mixed with the initial charge. \u2014 This ore and lime is put into the furnace with the pig and scrap, so that the hearth will be protected during the melting and an active cinder be at work continuously. When high-phos phorus stock is used, the amount of oxidation to be done for a given weight of pig-iron is much greater than in acid practice. Thus in 10,000 pounds of low-phosphorus iron for an acid open hearth, the oxygen-absorbing power is as follows : 1.0 per cent, silicon. = 100 pounds Si, absorbing 114.3 pounds oxygen. 3.5 percent, carbon = 351) pounds C, absorbing 466.7 pounds oxygen. Total oxygen absorption, 681.0 pounds. If pig-iron be used in basic work with the same content of silicon and carbon, but with the addition of 1.00 per cent, of phosphorus, there will be an additional absorptive power of 129 pounds of oxygen or a total of 710 pounds. If the first mixture were put"], [166, "138 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. into a furnace there would be about 40 per cent, of the work done during the melting (under the conditions shown in the preceding chapter), so after melting there would remain 60 per cent, of 581, or 349 pounds of oxygen to be given to the bath. In the second case, it is evident that the presence of phos phorus will not cause a greater action during melting, but that if all other conditions are similar, the total absorption will be the same, so that, after melting, the phosphoritic bath will have an absorptive power of 349 -f- 129 = 478 pounds of oxygen, and there will be one-third more work to do during the period of oreing with the same proportion of pig. These figures may seem somewhat abstruse, but they explain the very important fact that there is much more oxidation to do with phosphoritic iron than with good stock, so that it is advisable to use ore mixed with the charge to perform apart of the work during fusion. On an acid hearth, when running exclu sively on pig-iron, ore is sometimes added with the original charge, but there is always danger of this oxide uniting with the sand of the hearth before the metalloids can reduce it. In basic practice, on the contrary, the ore can do no harm, for it has little effect on the dolomite and soon reacts upon the silicon, phosphorus, and carbon. Table 37.

Sec 82. \u2014 Chemical history of basic open-hearth charges when no ore is mixed with the stock. \u2014 The addition of ore is not necessary when sufficient scrap is available, for the flame will supply oxygen to the metalloids, as will be shown by Table 37, which- gives the average history of 17 heats when no ore was used with the original charge, and when tests of metal and slag were taken at four different epochs.

Sec 83. \u2014 Elimination of phosphorus during melting. \u2014 The elimination of phosphorus during melting is a variable, depending upon the conditions of oxidation and the ability of the slag to absorb the phosphoric acid.

Elimination of Phosphorus and Carbon During Melting upon a Basic Hearth. Sec 84. \u2014 Composition of the slag after melting. \u2014 Neither the percentage nor the total amount of elimination during melting is a matter of vital importance, for whatever work is left undone during that period will be completed before tapping. In this removal of phosphorus after fusion, the composition of the slag is the important factor, and this will depend, primarily, upon the amount of silica, and, secondly, upon the lime added.

Thus, if the final slag is to contain 16.67 per cent, of Si02 and 50 per cent. CaO, it is evident that the basic additions must contain S-2 = three times as much available CaO as there is Si02 in the entire charge, and also that the final slag will weigh six times as much. The composition of the cinder differs considerably, for when good stock is used it may contain over 20 per cent, of silica and still be capable of eliminating the impurities, but when much phosphorus is to be removed, the silica must sometimes be as low as 12 per cent., the proportion of CaO usually vary ing inversely with the silica. The amount of lime which can be taken up is limited, for at a certain point the slag becomes viscous, particularly when the scorification of the hearth sup plies magnesia. Allowing for about 10 per cent, of MnO, 8 per cent. MgO, 18 per cent. FeO, and 4 per cent. A1208, etc., it may be roughly stated that with 12 per cent\", of Si02 there will be about 48 per cent. CaO, while with 20 per cent, of SiOs there will be 40 per cent. CaO. In the attainment of this rat io between Si02 and CaO the purity of the lime is an import ant factor, especially when a slag low in silica is needed. Ordinary lime as it comes from the kiln contains a certain unexpelled percentage of C02, and, in the handling and expo sure prior to use, it absorbs a certain amount of moisture, so that with the usual proportions of earthy impurities it will average about 80 per cent, of CaO. Sec 85. \u2014 Relative value of limes as determined by their chemical composition. \u2014 The content of Si02 in the lime depends entirely upon the kind of stone used and the care with which the ash of the fuel is kept separate. When a choice must be made between a cheap and impure lime and a more costly article low in silica, the value of each may be calculated by finding the excess of CaO over what is necessary to satisfy its own acids. Two representative limes are assumed in Table 39, both containing 80 per cent. CaO, one with 3 per cent, and the other with 7 per cent. Si02, and the computation is made for two different slags. lt will be seen that the pure lime is worth 31 per cent. more than the impure kind when a calcareous slag is to be"], [169, "141 THE BASIC OPEN-HEARTH PROCESS. formed, but if a more silicious cinder is permissible, as in the case when very little phosphorus is to be removed, the pure lime is worth only 12 per cent. more. Table 39. Relative Values of Limes with 3.0 and 7.0 per cent, of Si02. Sec. 86. \u2014 History of basic open-hearth slags. \u2014 The propor tions of Si02 and CaO are the main points in the construction of a basic slag, but there are other factors which exercise an important influence upon the result. Magnesia is always present from the wear of the hearth, but is rather undesirable as it makes the slag viscous and has much less power to hold phosphorus than lime. Alumina comes from the impurities in the dolomite, lime, and ore, but being usually in small amount may be neglected except when an analysis is expected to add up to 100 per cent. The same is true of the alkalies and small percentages of miscellaneous impurities. Manganese is usually present in the stock and serves a useful purpose in conferring fluidity upon the slag, so that, being a base itself, the total basic content can be higher than with a slag contain ing only silica and lime. It is also valuable in removing sul phur, for there is a tendency toward the formation of sulphide of manganese, which floats to the top of the metal where the sulphur, being exposed to the flame, is oxidized and passes away with the waste gases. This action is rather uncertain, and, in fact, the explanation is somewhat a matter of supposi tion, but it seems quite well proven that manganese, either Slag A. Slag B. Lime with 3 perj cent.Si02.

It is true that manganese is sometimes reduced from the slag by the carbon of the bath, and also that a certain percentage may remain unoxidized in the metal, but aside from this it may be said that the oxides of aluminum, silicon, and manganese exist in the slag in just the quantities that were added with the stock; but there are three other constituents, iron oxide, phosphoric acid, and sulphur, whose presence in the slag is determined by the conditions of manipulation and by the proportions of the other constituents. Iron oxide is always present in greater or less extent, the exact amount depending upon the reducing power of the car bon of the bath. It matters not whether ore is added before melting, after melting, or not at all ; there is a certain content of FeO which is demanded by the existing conditions, and that certain content will be present. An exception must be made in the case of ore added after the carbon is nearly elimi nated, but aside from this there will be just as much iron oxide lost in the slag when no ore is used as when it has been added in proper quantity, and therefo're it may be assumed that all the ore is a clear gain and that its iron is all reduced and added to the metallic bath. The presence of iron oxide in either acid or basic slag is an anomaly, for in an ordinary acid charge it seems as if the oxidation of the silicon and manganese would be sufficient to produce a slag without other aid. Nevertheless we have found in the foregoing chapter that there is a force at work in an acid furnace which is constantly creating a slag with a composition of about 50 per cent. Si02 and 45 per cent. FeO 4- MnO. If more FeO is added, the carbon of the metal imme diately seizes the oxygen and sets free metallic iron, but the same powerful action which so quickly accomplishes the * On the Elimination of Sulphur from Pig-Iron.

I., Vol. II, 1891, p. 76."], [171, "THE BASIC OPEN-HEARTH PROCESS. 143 destruction of this excess is not able to pass much below the limit even by exposure for hours without any addition of ore. There is an automatic adjustment to a fixed status which is one of the most wonderful phenomena of chemical physics. The only explanation I can offer is that it is an instance of the general law that all forces tend to work along the lines of least resistance, which, being interpreted for this case, means that a slag will seek to combine with anything that promotes fusibility. If given the opportunity a silicious slag absorbs either bases or silica, but preferably bases, and particularly those which impart the greatest fluidity. This action tends to continue indefinitely, and in an acid furnace, if the heat is not tapped after the carbon is burned, the formation of iron oxide will go on with great rapidity, and the fluidity of the slag will be greatly increased in spite of the cutting of the hearth. This latter action is a correcting condition, but it is not the controlling influence under ordinary circumstances, as is proven by the small amount of the scorification of the hearth during oreing. The real determinant is the carbon of the bath, and there is an equilibrium established between the oxidizing power of the flame, the reducing power of the metalloids, and the struggle after fluidity. In the basic process there is a difficulty in making a slag composed entirely of silicate of lime, for this is much more viscous than a slag of the same percentage of silica contain ing other bases ; there is a tendency, therefore, toward the absorption of iron oxide, but this is opposed by a contest on the part of the lime for the possession of the silica, and the result is a decrease in the percentage of iron when there is an increase in lime. Inasmuch as the substitution of CaO for FeO produces a more viscous slag, this would seem to invali date the theory just advanced, but, as above indicated, the effect is due not to a change in the law but to the action of stronger forces. The more bases that are present, the less necessity is there for an additional amount, since the weight of silica necessarily remains constant, and, as the reducing action of the metalloids comes into play, the slag begins to be robbed of its iron, which at the same time is its most reducible and its most fusible base. The presence of oxide of manga nese in the slag modifies without completely changing the"], [172, "144 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. relations just described, for, by furnishing an additional base and imparting greater fluidity, it tends to render the presence of iron oxide less necessary. Sec 87. \u2014 Automatic regulation of fluidity in basic open hearth slag. \u2014 This matter of fluidity is of vital practical im portance, for the slag must run freely from the furnace, else the hearth will soon be filled ; furthermore, the slag must be so basic that the hearth is not scorified. The two conditions, fluidity and basicity, determine the nature and amount of the basic additions, for the sum of CaO and MgO can not much exceed 55 percent, without producing a viscous cinder, neither can the percentage of SiO\u00bb fall below 10 per cent, unless unusual amounts are present of the oxides of iron, manganese, or phosphorus. I have advanced this theory of the automatic regulation of fluidity with some hesitation, but it seems to account for a curious relation between the content of Si02 and FeO in a large number of basic slags, which are grouped and averaged in Table 40.

The phosphoric acid was not determined, but it may be taken for granted that an increased proportion of phosphorus in the charge will give higher phosphoric acid in the cinder, and the table shows that in the case of high phosphorus the com bined Si02 and FeO runs about 27.5 per cent., with medium phosphorus about 35 per cent., and with low phosphorus about 36 to 37 per cent. It is quite true that a differ ence in manipulation would change the absolute per centages, but the attainment of a certain definite content of FeO -f- Si02 seems assured. This conclusion is verified by an examination of the individuals of the original records, for it is found that low Si02 is accompanied by high FeO and vice versa. This is shown by Table 41 which is composed of the extreme cases of high and low percentages of Si02 and FeO, found in the individual heats which compose the groups in Table 40. Table 41. Maxima and Minima in the Individual Heats Composing the Groups in Table 40. It would be entirely wrong to suppose that an increase in Si02 has reduced the FeO by simple dilution, for a reduction in FeO from 20 per cent, to 10 per cent, would imply a per manent addition of Si02 equal to the entire volume of the slag, and this is manifestly absurd. The conclusion seems inevitable that Si02 and FeO replace one another in someway, and that one fulfils some function of the other. As FeO is basic and Si02 is acid, this function can not possibly be related to the basicity of the slag or any strictly chemical status, and the only explanation which suggests itself is that both confer fluidity and that there is an automatic regula tion of this quality in accordance with the theory before elaborated.

Sec 88. \u2014 Determining chemical conditions in basic open hearth slags. \u2014 Just as oxide of iron exists in slag in accord ance with favorable conditions rather than with the initial character of the charge, so the content of phosphoric acid is governed by the chemical environment. As a general law it may be said that the capacity of a cinder for phosphoric acid increases with the proportion of bases it contains, and that lime is the most potent of these bases. The most inipi irtant modi fication of this law is the necessity for a certain fluidity, since a slag which is very viscous does not seem to be as effective as one which is rendered fluid by oxide of manganese or iron. Thus, although lime is immeasurably superior to oxide of iron as a dephosphorizing agent, nevertheless, as I have shown else where,* a slag containing a slightly higher percentage of FeO is more efficient. One of the more important determinants of the capacity of slag for phosphorus is the phosphorus itself. The absorption of phosphoric acid is not a case of simple solution (if such a phenomenon exists) like that of salt in water, but it is a union of acid and base, and, therefore, each molecule of phosphoric acid which enters the slag decreases its capacity for more in exactly the same way that silica would. It is impossible to prove this conclusively by ordinary averages, for the additions of lime are usually regulated by the demands of the silica rather than of the phosphorus, and it is a coincidence if the maximum content of phosphoric acid is present. Moreover, the precise determining conditions vary with each particular combination of the remaining elements, with the intensity of the reducing conditions, and with the duration of the exposure. Thus Table 42 gives examples of slags which Mere produced under abnormal conditions ; the samples were taken from an open-hearth furnace soon after melting, and before an extreme temperature had been reached to give the carbon of the bath its full reducing power to break up unstable compounds. These slags are especially selected as being extreme instances of high phosphorus for a given silica, and they are therefore valueless as an indication of what may be expected *The Open-Hearth Process. Trans. A. I. M. E., Vol. XXII, p. 446."], [175, "147 THE BASIC OPEN-HEARTH PROCESS. in regular practice. They do show, however, that there is no such thing as a critical percentage of silica, since a cinder with 37 per cent. Si02 may hold 2 per cent, P206. Table 42. Unstable Basic Open-Hearth Slags. The slags in Table 43, although selected somewhat arbi trarily, are fairer examples of the results of regular work. In both Table 42 and 43 there is a column headed \" Si02 + P205,\" and the constancy of this total under similar conditions, even with slags of widely varying character, indicates that the total acid content of the slag is the measure of its power to absorb phosphorus.

This renders futile any attempts to make accurate quantitative calculations on the chemical history, but otherwise the action is of little importance since it can not be relied on for purification of the metal. This volatilization occurs in greater measure in the case of sulphur, but here also it is entirely impracticable to eliminate any appreciable proportion by this method alone, since volatiliza tion occurs only from the slag, and the action, therefore, pre supposes the transfer of sulphur from the metal to the cinder, imposition, per cent.

The removal of sulphur can be accomplished in at least four ways, which will be considered seriatim. (1) By the addition of metallic manganese and liquation of sulphide of manganese. The extent of this reaction is very uncertain, but usually the addition of 0.60 to 0.75 per cent. of manganese in the form of recarburizer reduces the sulphur content about 0.01 per cent. (2) By the use of manganese ore, which, being reduced by the metalloids of the bath, furnishes metallic manganese. The ore should be added with the original charge in order that it may be thoroughly mixed with the metal. It is very difficult to isolate the effect of this agent from the contem poraneous action of the basic slag with which it must be associated, but there is no doubt that it aids in the purifica tion. (3) By the action of a very limey cinder. In a former paper* I gave the results of experiments in removing sul phur by ordinary lime slags. The cinder, during melting, was kept high in silica to economize lime, and part of this slag was removed after fusion, and fresh lime added. Notwithstand ing the high acid content, the slag after melting held quite an appreciable proportion of sulphur. The final slag, being richer in lime, removed a greater quantity and the results seem to show that, as the silica decreases, the capacity for sulphur increases, but the relation is not as regular as might be wished, and it must be acknowledged that many points are still obscure. The records are given in Tables 44 and 45. (4) By oxychloride of lime. A process has been devised by E. H. Saniterf whereby sulphur is eliminated from basic open hearth metal by the use of oxychloride of lime.

The results of a more complete investiga tion of one charge are shown in Table 47, the data being taken from a paper by Snelus.* The sulphur after melting is higher than the calculated initial content, but this is probably due to incorrect sampling and to the absorption of sulphur from ore and gas, since the percentage of sulphur in the slag shows that a considerable amount was taken from the metal.

This point is not satisfactorily settled, for notwithstanding the learned discussions and investigations following Saniter's experiments, the inner history of desulphurization is still unwritten. A quantitative investigation that I made into the elimina tion of sulphur by weighing and analyzing the slags from three of the charges given in Table 44, showed that about 36 per cent, of the sulphur was unaccounted for, having probably been carried away as sulphurous acid (S02) in the waste gases. The fact that both sulphur and phosphorus thus escape in an intangible form and in uncertain quantities, renders quanti tative work on basic slags very unsatisfactory. Moreover, a sample of slag is not always representative, for on some heats portions of the basic additions remain sticking to the hearth, while on others old accumulations of such deposits dissolve in a charge to which they do not belong. Sec 90. \u2014 Removal ofthe slag after melting. \u2014 When the stock is properly charged, the greater part of the basic addition be comes an active agent during the melting of the charge. Especially when ore is used the intense action oxidizes a con siderable proportion of the phosphorus during the melting, and the slag after fusion contains oftentimes a high percentage of phosphoric acid. The idea has occurred to numberless metal lurgists that this first slag should be removed in order to get rid of its phosphorus and silica and thus give the opportunity for a new and purer slag having a greater dephosphorizing power, but the practical difficulties in the way have always compelled a relinquishment of the plan. The exact height of the metal in the hearth is always varying with the filling of the bottom and with the frothing of the charge, so that there is danger of losing metal if a taphole is opened much below the level of the upper surface of the slag. On the contrary, if the slag is tapped from its upper surface there is no force to the stream and it is constantly chilling as it runs. The complete removal of the slag can be accomplished, however, by the use of a tilting furnace, for the entire charge can be poured out and only the metal returned to the furnace. The possibility of thus disposing with certainty of nearly all"], [180, "152 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. the silica of the charge, and of whatever phosphorus and sul phur may be in the slag after fusion, opens up a field of speculation as to the best practice in different cases. Given a pig-iron containing a considerable proportion of silicon aud with low phosphorus, it will be an advantage to have the first slag as high in silica as possible so as to avoid the addition of a corresponding quantity of lime. When the metal is returned to the furnace, the small amount of cinder which sticks to the hearth, together with the silica of the ore and a little extra lime, will furnish slag enough to remove the phosphorus. This practice, however, cannot be carried to an extreme, for if the amount of lime is reduced to such an extent that the slag after melting contains much over 30 per cent, of silica, the hearth will be badly scorified. If melted pig-iron is used, this difficulty disappears, for ore may be added to a bath of pig at the rate of 2000 pounds per hour and the silicon be rapidly oxidized. The slag so produced in the absence of a full supply of lime may run about 30 or 35 per cent, of silica and 25 to 35 per cent, of iron oxide. This would scorify the hearth if left long enough in the furnace, but it should be removed after the silicon is oxidized, for during the oxidation of carbon from a content of three per cent, down to about one per cent, the frothing is very violent, and if the slag is not removed there will be considerable trouble and delay. If the pig carries much phosphorus or sulphur, the first slag should not be too rich in silica, for under these conditions the full content of the impurities will remain in the metal and it will be necessary to make a large volume of cinder to remove them. The better way in this case is to form a slag rich enough in lime to carry a good proportion of phosphoric acid and sulphur, and liquid enough to pour well. When the metal is returned to the furnace a second slag can be made from fresh lime, and it will be evident that it Mill more readily absorb the impurities than a cinder which is already partly satisfied. Sec 91. \u2014 Automatic formation ofa slag ofa given chemical composition. \u2014 In such practice there might appear to be a difficulty in properly regulating the composition of the second slag, but the records in Tables 44 and 45 show that such is not the case, for, in the heats there given, a part of the"], [181, "THE BASIC OPEN-HEARTH PROCESS. 153 slag was removed soon after melting. Quite a difference will be found between the first and second slags, but this is because the first slag was purposely made high in silica in order to save lime. When it is required to maintain a similar composition throughout the heat, it can be done in basic as well as in acid practice, as shown by the average slag analyses of twenty-seven heats given in Table 48. Table 48. Average Slag Analyses of Twenty-Seven Basic Open-Hearth Heats. Four-fifths of the lime was added with the charge, and the remainder, together with 400 pounds of ore, was used after melting, but in spite of the incorporation of this basic material into the slag during the interval between the two stages at which the samples were taken, it will be seen that by care ful supervision and through the action of the internal chem ical forces, a remarkably uniform composition was maintained, which proves conclusively that the manipulations of the basic process are as completely under control as the operations upon the acid hearth. Sec 92. \u2014 Recarburization and rephosphorization. \u2014 Recar burization is carried on in the same way as in acid work, and is subject to the same general laws. A complicating condi tion is often added when either the stock or the ore contains any considerable proportion of manganese, for the decarburized metal may then hold as much as .20 or .30 per cent, of Mn. Not only must this be allowed for in making the final addi tion, but it will also be found that the bath contains less oxy gen under these circumstances, and therefore there will be less loss of metallic manganese during the reaction. In basic practice there is a factor not present in acid work, in the danger of rephosphorization, or the return of phosphorus from slag to metal. In the basic Bessemer this is a source of considerable trouble, but in the open-hearth the recarbu- Composition, per cent. Slag. SiO.. P20s- CaO.

Moreover, during the solution of the ferro, the slag is constantly at work with its dephosphorizing influence, so that the sum total of the reactions may even show a decrease in phosphorus. Other things being equal, it would seem probable that a slag containing a high percentage of phosphoric acid will hold this component less firmly than a purer cinder, and I have tried to illustrate this point* by expe riments the results of which may be summarized as follows : (1) With slags containing under 5 per cent, P206 and not over 20 per cent. Si02, the rephosphorization need not exceed .01 nor average over zero per cent. (2) With slags containing from 5 to 10 per cent. P205 and not over 19 per cent. Si02, the rephosphorization need not exceed .015 nor average over .005 per cent. (3) With slags containing from 10 to 15 per cent. P206 and not over 17 per cent. Si02, the rephosphorization need not exceed .02 nor average over .005 per cent. (4) With slags containing from 15 to 20 per cent. P206 and not over 12 per cent. Si02, the rephosphorization need not exceed .02 nor average over .01 per cent. In using phosphoritic stock it is not safe to presuppose the elimination of phosphorus below .04 per cent, until the carbon has been lowered to about .08 per cent. Hence, to make rail steel it is necessary to eliminate the carbon to that point and then add the required amount of recarburizer, as in the Bessemer process. It is impracticable to use melted spiegel iron in open-hearth practice, because the charges come so irregularly and at such long intervals that a cupola becomes chilled, but it has been found possible to add finely divided carbon in the ladle, its absorption by the metal being so rapid that the results are quite regular. Several ways of doing this have been devised, the most suc cessful of which has been very fully described by Dr. Wed dings.

These are dried thoroughly to expel all the uncombined water, and are then ready to be fed into the ladle as the heat is poured. The escape of the combined water in the lime causes the bricks to crumble to pieces when in contact with the melted steel, but this crumbling is gradual, so that the carbon is fed to the metal continuously and the bath is able to absorb it as fast as it is set free. This moisture also creates a constant motion of the bricks and acts as a mechanical stirrer. I am informed by Mr. George W. G\u0153tz, of Milwaukee, that the kind of coal which is referred to by Dr. Wedding is a rather hard bituminous coal and not at all what is known as \" anthracite\" in America, and that the practice at different works leads to the conclusion that coke dust or other similar forms of carbon would answer equally well."], [184, "156 CHAPTER XII. CONSIDERATIONS ON CERTAIN COSTS OF MANUFACTURE. Section 93. \u2014 Conditions determining the supply of scrap. \u2014 It has been shown that the Bessemer process requires for its operation only the product of the blast-furnace, but that it can use to advantage, for the cooling of the charge, a small part of the scrap which is produced in working its product into finished shapes. The remainder of the scrap is a by product which can only be used at an augmented cost by running on a very high-silicon iron. In the open-hearth furnace, on the other hand, it is advan tageous to use about 75 per cent, of scrap in the mixture. This is more than will be produced from the output of the fur nace in any series of finishing processes, and hence in a plant making all its steel by converters there will always be a sur plus of scrap which is worth less to the producer than pig iron, while in a plant making all its steel in open-hearth furnaces there will be a deficit of scrap, and the plant will be willing to pay more for it than for pig-iron on account of the advantages in time, fuel, and product to be saved by its use. The scrap also has an additional value from the diminished waste as compared with pig-iron, due to the smaller content of foreign elements. The simple relation whereby the Bessemer has a surplus of what the open-hearth needs, is complicated by the fact that miscellaneous material is continually being thrown on the market from worn-out rails, boilers, and general structures. In the past such scrap was mostly wrought-iron, but with the increasing use of steel in construction the percentage of steel in such scrap is rapidly increasing. For the acid open-hearth, common wrought-iron is unsuitable on account of the high"], [185, "CERTAIN COSTS OF MANUFACTURE. 157 phosphorus it contains, and although it may be used in the basic furnace, it is usually worth more to rework into finished iron than to remelt. This supply of miscellaneous scrap is evidently entirely unconnected with the business of making steel, and hence it may and usually does happen that at places most remote from the great producing centers, steel scrap is a drug upon the market. Such a place may be a very good situation for an open-hearth furnace provided the product can be eco nomically put into a shape to be sold in the local market, but it must be borne in mind that as soon as there is a demand for the scrap it ceases to be a drug and becomes a commodity. Sec 94. \u2014 Comp>arison of the cost of the Bessemer and open hearth 2)rocesses. \u2014 Even with cheap scrap it is usually out of the question for a small open-hearth plant to compete with the Bessemer in the manufacture of common material, although the difference in the strictly metallurgical items is not as great as usually supposed. A comparison of the details of the two processes will show that the furnace requires more fuel than the cupola, but this is counterbalanced by the fact that the open-hearth does not need a battery of boilers to supply a blowing engine. The repairs to hearth and roof will be matched by the relining of cupolas and vessels and the very expensive vessel-bottoms, while the difference in labor is not prohibitory. The greater cost of making steel by the open-hearth arises almost altogether from the greater output in the Bessemer of a regular grade of metal, cast in regular sizes of ingots. Up to within a short time there has been no true open-hearth plant in this country. There have been several furnaces con nected with one establishment, but the first systematic ar rangement is the work of the last few years. In a small establishment the cost of working the product into finished steel is greatly enhanced. With small shapes and bars it often happens that a small finishing mill can run economically on a production of only twenty-five or thirty tons a day, but the manufacture of the billets is a different matter. The ingots should be at least fourteen inches square to provide for sufficient work upon the metal, and the reduc tion of these to billet form requires a strong and heavy mill."], [186, "158 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. Such a mill, if at all capable of doing the work, can handle four hundred tons a day just as well as twenty-five, and with the small output the boilers and furnaces must waste fuel, and men must stand waiting, and it is evident that each ton of product must bear a heavy financial load. Moreover, when a charge does not show the chemical composition desired the small plant may have no use for it, and to some extent it is a loss, while in the larger steel works, with diversified products and a wide market, it seldom happens that a heat is not ap plicable to some order. Sec 95. \u2014 Development of large plants. \u2014 These and many other considerations render it very difficult to make steel economically in a small open-hearth plant, and the tendency of modern steel manufacture is toward concentration of the business of producing the raw material. Blooms, slabs, and billets may best be made in a large establishment, fitted for handling a thousand tons a day, with a proper outfit of labor atories and testing apparatus, with a management fitted for meeting all problems in new specifications, and with a market so varied that steel may be used for the purposes for which it is fit, rather than for the special order on which it was made. In the manufacture of plates it has been the practice to build an open-hearth plant in connection with a plate mill and roll the plates direct from the ingot, but this system has been superseded in some works by the erection of mills designed to roll very large ingots and cut them into pieces suitable for plates. The extra expense is counterbalanced in some measure by the reduction in pit-work due to the smaller number of ingots handled, but it does not seem probable that the cost of heavy slabs can ever be brought down to that of ingots of the same weight, although in sizes under 1000 pounds the difference will not be great. The slab will give less scrap than an ingot in rolling into a plate, and this must be counted in the estimate of cost ; but the strongest argu ment in favor of preliminary slabbing is the greater uniformity and homogeneity of the product. It is possible that some open-hearth plants may be able to make common steel in competition with a Bessemer plant where the iron is melted in cupolas, but it is doubtful whether they can compete with a large converting plant using"], [187, "159 CERTAIN COSTS OF MANUFACTURE. iron direct from the blast-furnace, even though this point be contested by the use of direct metal in the open-hearth. The Bessemer system was worked out to its limit in years gone by under the spur of immense profits, an unlimited market, and ample capital, but the open-hearth has been a side-show in the big steel works, and a sort of shop in the smaller estab lishments. With the increasing demand for steel in construc tion and the constantly increasing stringency of specifications in order to procure the best material, the field of the open hearth is widening every day, and the result will be an im provement in the quality and a lowering of the price. Sec 96. \u2014 Determining economic conditions of steel manu facture. \u2014 The foregoing comparison of the Bessemer and open-hearth has failed to give any definite data on the items of cost, because in different districts there are enormous variations in the cost of raw material, of fuel, of refractories, and of labor. For the same reason it is impossible to give the relative position of the acid and basic processes. The decision in the question between acid and basic linings for the converter oftentimes settles itself, for an acid Bessemer can not well be run in Alabama with its phosphoritic ores, and a basic Bessemer would be out of the question in the Lake Superior district. In such cases the only problem is whether either process will pay at all, and this can not always be decided by the simple natural advantages, however marked they may be. There are places in the uninhabited valleys of the northern Rocky Mountains where coal fields and ore beds lie waiting for the coming of the metallurgist ; but in such a district the installation to-day of a plant with its dependent community would be done at an enormous financial sacrifice, the labor which could be obtained at ex orbitant rates would be unreliable and inefficient, and the cost of transporting the product to market would be pro hibitory. The financial equation of a great industry is a combination of social and metallurgical factors. A district where the pig-iron contains over 2.00 per cent, of phosphorus is the natural field for a basic Bessemer ; where it contains under 0.10 per cent, is the field for an acid Bessemer or open hearth ; and where it contains any proportion between these extremes is the field for a basic open-hearth ; but these con-"], [188, "160 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. ditions must be supplemented not only by cheap fuel, but by fixed labor conditions and cheap transportation to a sufficient market. These platitudes seem so axiomatic that they could be called superfluous if their disregard had not caused the waste of many millions in ill-starred enterprises. Sec 97. \u2014 ( 'omparison of the costs of the acid and the basic- Bessemer processes. \u2014 In a district where both high and low phosphorus irons are obtainable, and where the impure metal costs one or two dollars less per ton, the question arises as to whether an acid or a basic-lined converter will produce the cheaper steel. The cost of labor in manufacture and repairs must always be more in basic than in acid work, the exact amount depending on the scale of wages. In Germany, where a workman receives seventy-five cents per day, the conditions differ from those in our own country where nearly twice that sum must be paid for twelve hours of common labor. Moreover, this proportion of double the foreign pay holds good through all the grades of work, so that while the American day laborer receives only seventy-five cents more per day, the American skilled workman receives two dollars more. This factor of labor is not confined to the converting-room but forms a large part of the cost of every article used ; it appears in the manufacture of the iron, the coke, and the lime, in the preparation of the refractories, in the transporta tion and handling of the miscellaneous supplies, in the repairs and shop work, and in the salaries of clerks and engineers. These conditions place the basic-Bessemer process in America on an entirely different footing from that which it occupies in other countries, and it is doubtful whether there is any place in the Northern States where the basic con verter can successfully compete with the acid plants that are supplied from the mines of Lake Superior and Cuba. Even though these financial difficulties should be entirely overcome, there would still remain the feeling of uncertainty regarding the quality of the product, which would be a strong argument against its general use in structural engineering. Sec 98. \u2014 Comparison of the costs of the acid and the basic open-hearth processes. \u2014 The relation of the acid and basic linings of the open-hearth furnace to each other is entirely different from the relation existing between the modifications"], [189, "161 CERTAIN COSTS OF MANUFACTURE. of the Bessemer process, for the basic open-hearth is not confined to high-phosphorus stock. When it does use such material it stands more nearly on a level with the basic con verter in the danger of rephosphorization from a very phos phoritic slag, but in the case of the Bessemer there is no middle ground, for high-phosphorus iron must be used to produce heat, while in the open-hearth a medium mixture may be used containing less than 0.75 per cent, of phos phorus. With such a bath, and with proper care, the quality of the steel may be prophesied with certainty ; and when a particularly pure article is wanted, a better stock may be charged to insure a low content of phosphorus in the steel. To these primary advantages is added the feasibility of tak ing tests before tapping. In the Bessemer such tests are very crude, since the bath cools too rapidly to allow of long delay, but in the open-hearth there is opportunity for rapid chemical determinations in the laboratory. Moreover, much less danger of rephosphorization exists, for there is perfect control over the nature of the slag and less mixing of metal and cinder during recarburization. Thus the process on the basic hearth differs radically from that in the converter, and it follows that the acid and basic modifications of open-hearth work are more nearly alike than the acid and basic Bessemers, and that there is no such ground for questioning the reliability of basic open-hearth steel as there is of basic Bessemer. It is also necessary to consider that it is practicable, and not at all an uncommon practice, to use the same stock in basic as in acid furnaces. When this is done and nothing is charged containing over .10 per cent, of phosphorus, it would seem as if the last bulwark of the prejudiced mind had been overthrown. In thus comparing the acid and basic linings of the hearth, it is well to bear in mind that the finest kinds of acid open hearth steel are made by using charcoal blooms, puddled iron, and washed metal, all of which are made by a basic process and oftentimes from a very common sort of pig-iron. There seems, therefore, to be no good ground for prohibiting the use of basic open-hearth steel, since the timid engineer may insist, if he will, that all stock shall contain less than .10 per cent, of phosphorus."], [190, "162 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. Sec 99. \u2014 Method of mcmufactun ax affecting the quality of the steel. \u2014 It is urged by some that the engineer has nothing to do with the manufacture of the steel but that his province begins with the rolled bar. All this will be true when the engineering profession discovers a system of tests which will find out everything about steel, but this has not yet been done. The woful mistakes made by Fairbairn, Euverte, R. W. Hunt, and others, in testing phosphoritic steels, show that the engineering laboratory must be supplemented by chemical analyses. It is well not to assume the truth of all tradi tion, but if there is any one fact which seems demonstrated it is that phosphorus will hide its true character in the testing machine, but will certainly make itself known at some future time. It is a pity that this can not be received as proven, so that each newly-fledged engineer will not insist upon learn ing it at the expense of money and of life. There is a corollary to be drawn from these facts regarding phosphorus, which may be stated as follows : Since the true quality of steel does not show itself in the testing machine, it is idle to claim that Bessemer is as good as open-hearth metal simply because it gives as good results under ordinary tests. The prejudice against Bessemer steel is the outgrowth of long experience and many failures, and it may not be dis regarded. The prejudice against basic open-hearth metal rests on an entirely different foundation, having as its starting point the supposition that bad raw material must give a had product. In acid work this is most certainly true, but on the basic hearth the objectionable element is carried away in the slag, and the doctrine is left entirely unsupported. The true test is the behavior in actual use, and no one will claim that American open-hearth basic steel has failed in this respect, for it has not yet had extensive trial and where used has made an excellent record. Sec 100. \u2014 Popular errors regarding the basic open-hearth process. \u2014 There is one general misunderstanding in the en gineering profession concerning the basic process which needs to be corrected. It is currently believed that the basic open hearth is a kind of magic retort into which almost anything in the shape of iron can be treated at a minimum cost and converted into a metal just good enough to deceive the en-"], [191, "CERTAIN COSTS OF MANUFACTURE. 163 gineer; and it is also a prevailing opinion that the manufac turer would always like to have the privilege of making steel in such a furnace on account of the cheapness of the raw material. It may not be amiss, therefore, to say that in the Northern and Eastern States the cost of making ordinary structural steel is greater on the basic than on the acid hearth. This arises from the fact that mill-iron costs very nearly as much as Bessemer-iron, and that pig-iron usually constitutes only one-third or one-half the charge. The rest is scrap, and there is no cheap phosphoritic low-carbon material in the market, for wrought-iron is worth more to re work than to melt and sells at a higher price than steel scrap. If the charge is one-third pig-iron and two-thirds scrap, the advantage in stock will be only one-third of the difference in price between good and bad iron, and this difference is very seldom as much as two dollars per ton, so that the gain may easily be covered by the basic additions and the additional labor and repairs. If a greater proportion of pig be used, the waste, the extra time necessary, the increased fuel, and the lessened output will generally counterbalance the gain. Sec 101. \u2014 Relative cost of stock in the Pittsburg district for making steel by different 2)rocesses. \u2014 Leaving out of consid eration the incidental running expenses, it may be well to consider one or two extreme instances to see what bearing the nature of the raw material has upon the cost of the product. The impossibility of giving a general value to pig-iron and scrap is recognized, but if the open-hearth and the Bessemer are charged the same price for the same stock, and if it is assumed that scrap is worth one dollar more than pig-iron, the error will not be great in the comparison. It is true that Bessemer pig-iron has been made for less than eleven dollars per ton in Pittsburg, but this was only rendered possible by a complete disregard of those royalties and profits on the ore, the coke, the transportation, and the manufacture, which rightfully belong to the capital invested and which must assuredly be paid in the long run to insure the continuance of industrial life. The waste is assumed to be the same as in acid practice, for although there is twice as great a volume of slag, it con tains only half as great a percentage of iron, but the slight"], [192, "164 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL gain in cost of stock is fully overcome by the extra cost of hearth material. The substitution of any other values in the calculation is a matter of simple arithmetic, but it will be evident that no radical change can be made in the comparison of acid and basic practice when using similar mixtures. The field for the basic hearth in the north is in making the finer qualities of steel with a low content of phosphorus. It is difficult to give the cost of low-phosphorus acid steel owing to the wide variations in the cost of pure stock, but it may be roughly stated that pig-iron and scrap containing less than .04 per cent, of phosphorus are worth $4.00 per ton more than common metal averaging about .10 per cent.

Sec 102. \u2014 Economic conditions in the South. \u2014 The condi- tions in Alabama and Tennessee are widely different from those which have just been discussed. Considering first the case of a works which purchases no outside low-carbon material, it will be evident that the amount of scrap avail able will be the amount which is produced at the works, and this will be about 30 per cent, of the ingot weight, or about 25 per cent, of the charge. The proportion of pig-iron will accordingly be about 75 per cent. The high sulphur and poor quality of southern fuel, and the high silica in the coke and ore, will render very difficult, if not impracticable, the economical manufacture of pig-iron"], [193, "165 CERTAIN costs of manufacture. which shall be low in both silicon and sulphur. It will be much safer to make regularly a product slightly high in sili con, which is only objectionable, rather than to often make high sulphur, which is fatal. In the following assumed composition the sulphur is put at a workable amount, while the silicon is placed at what seems a fair percentage. Alabama Iron.

About 8000 pounds of ore will be necessary, and if this carries 3 per cent, of silica, there will be an additional 240 pounds, making 1530 pounds of silica. If the final slag con tains 19 per cent, of Si02, 9 per cent, of P205, and from 45 to 50 per cent, of CaO, it is evident that there must be added two and one-half times as much CaO as there is Si02, or about 3825 pounds CaO, which is equal to 4780 pounds of ordinary burned lime. This lime will run about 4 per cent, in silica, thus furnishing 191 pounds. Allowing for this, there is a total of 1721 pounds of silica requiring 4300 pounds of lime. The final slag will weigh 8000 pounds and will contain about 15 per cent, of combined iron and 5 per cent, of shot, making about 1600 pounds of iron which will be carried away, or about 3 per cent, of the charge. Together with the 4.74 per cent, of oxidiz able metalloids there will be theoretically a loss of nearly 8 per cent., or 4300 pounds. The ore will supply more than this amount of metallic iron and hence, by calculation, the weight of metal tapped should equal the weight charged. Experi ence proves that this is not quite true, for there is always a certain quantity of dirt entering with the stock, as well as a scorification of hearth, walls, and roof, and since all such foreign material increases the volume of slag, and since there will also be a certain loss of metal down the ports, it follows that there will be a deficit, which in the following calcula tion is assumed to be about two per cent. The summary is as shown on the following page."], [194, "166 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. It may be said that some iron has been made in Alabama for less than $7.00 per ton, but it is very doubtful if the average cost for any furnace, for a period of five years, would be any lower if bad iron were marked off at its real value, and if all the general and operating expenses, together with the depreciation and interest charges, were properly dis tributed. It is more probable that a higher figure would more fairly represent a healthy industrial and financial situation. BIRMINGHAM DISTRICT. Eighteen tons pig-iron @ $7.00 $120.00 Six tons scrap @ $7.00 42.00 Three and one-half tons pure ore fit, $4.50 15.75 Four thousand three hundred pounds pure burned lime @ 16 cents per bushel 8.60 Total $192.85 Product, 23.5 tons of steel. Cost of stock, $8.19 for each ton of finished product. It will be seen that this cheap stock has given an advantage of $4.00 per ton over the Pittsburg district, but this will be overcome to a great extent by the delay in melting the larger quantity of ore and lime, and by the lengthening of the period of oreing due to the unwieldy volume of slag. Taking into consideration the extra wear of the hearth with consequent repairs, and the reduced capacity of the furnace when large quantities of slag are produced, it is probable that a plant will not make much more than half as much steel in a year under this practice as it would if the charge were made up of good pig-iron mixed with sufficient scrap, and this is equivalent to saying that the cost of fuel and repairs will be doubled ; the skilled labor per ton will be much increased on account of the decreased product, while the common labor keeps pace with the extra stock and slag to be handled. The above calcula tion assumes that the pig-iron is cast in chills so as to be free from sand or is put into the furnace when melted, for if it is cast in sand the waste and the volume of slag will be enor mously increased. It also calls for the use of pure lime and for rich ores, the latter probably requiring transportation from Lake (Superior, and experience will prove that these specifications are in the line of true economy. The contents of silicon and sulphur are not what might be wished, but they are fully as low, when considered together, as can regularly be made by the average furnaceman from"], [195, "CERTAIN COSTS OF MANUFACTURE. 167 the silicious ores and the sulphurous, weak, and silicious cokes of Alabama. The difficulty of making low-silicon, low-sulphur irons in this region has been recognized by all metallurgists, and various projects have been pushed forward whereby irons high in silicon could be handled, it being assumed that if sufficient leeway is given in this element the sulphur can be eliminated by a hot-working blast-furnace. The most attract ive method is what is known as the duplex process, by which the silicon is removed in a converter and the metal then transferred to a basic open-hearth for the elimination of phos phorus. That this is a comprehensive and perfectly feasible system cannot be denied, but in the opinion of most steel makers the expense of the operation will be prohibitory. A careful calculation of the waste and scrap in Bessemerizing and reworking, and a consideration of the incidental expenses incident to such a complex plant, render the installation of such an outfit more attractive to the constructive contractor than to the investor. Sec 103. \u2014 Desiliconization by means of basic slag. \u2014 An other proposition which made quite a stir in the newspapers at one time, consists in pouring the pig-iron into a ladleful of melted basic open-hearth cinder and burning the silicon by the oxygen contained in the slag. Certain experiments have been chronicled showing that the action does take place and that the silicon is in great measure removed, but in the face of these records I propose to argue that there is some mistake and that the importance of the reaction has been much over estimated. In experimental work it is quite possible to pour a small amount of metal through a large quantity of slag, but in continuous practical operation it is plain that the metal of one charge can be treated only with the slag from a previous charge, and the problem immediately arises of find ing the amount of slag on each heat, This is a rather diffi cult problem, for the volume of slag is entirely dependent upon the weight of silica to be satisfied, and this weight of silica is dependent upon the amount of silicon in the charge, and this in turn is dependent on the success of the desilicon izing operation. If the silicon of the pig is removed in the preliminary treatment, then only a small amount of slag will be produced and the success of the next desiliconization will"], [196, "168 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. be jeopardized in exact proportion. Leaving out of account this history of self-destruction, and neglecting all practical difficulties in keeping the cinder liquid during the pouring with its attendant frothing, it will be assumed that a heat is made up of eighteen tons of melted pig-iron and six tons of scrap, with a production of 8000 pounds of slag containing 18 per cent, of FeO. It would be easy to make a more favor able slag by having a higher content of iron oxide, but this would be a sacrifice of every other desideratum. It will also be assumed, although so perfect a reaction is improbable in regular practice, that by the pouring of the iron through the slag this FeO is reduced to 6 per cent. Under these condi tions 12 per cent, of 8000 pounds, or 960 pounds, of FeO will be reduced, furnishing 213 pounds of oxygen, which will unite with 186 pounds of silicon. Calculation shows that this is 0.46 per cent, of the 40320 pounds of pig-iron, so that under assumptions which are certainly roseate, there is a possible elimination of less than half of one per cent, of silicon. That this would be a decided benefit can not be questioned, but it can hardly justify the confident proclamation that the basic question in the South has been forever solved. In localities where scrap can be obtained the . difficulties will be less, since a smaller amount of pig-iron can be used and there will be a corresponding reduction in the weight of silicon and phosphorus. It will be found, however, that the proportion of pig-iron must be very nearly half of the total charge, in order that the bath shall be high enough in carbon, after melting, to allow the removal of the phosphorus and sulphur. A reduction in the initial content of silicon in the pig-iron will help matters more than anything else, but it is hardly probable, as before remarked, that the average will be any lower, over a long period of time, than the figure which has been assumed in the foregoing calculations. The use of a tilt ing furnace, and the removal of the slag, have been discussed in Section 90, and it is believed that this system would be very advantageous in handling the irons of the South."], [197, "CHAPTER XIII. SEGREGATION AND HOMOGENEITY. Section 104. \u2014 Cause of segregation. \u2014 Every liquid has a criti cal point in temperature below which it may not cool without freezing into a solid state. This transformation takes place by the rearrangement of the molecules into crystals, and in this rearrangement there is a very strong tendency for each crystal-forming substance, whether it be an element or a com pound, to separate from any other substances with which it may be mixe\u201ed. This tendency will result in a very perfect isolation when the substances have little affinity for each other and freeze at widely different temperatures. Under these circumstances, if the temperature be very slowly lowered, the more easily frozen substances will almost completely crystallize out, leaving the more fusible in a liquid state. It will be evident, however, that the completeness of the separation will be lessened by a hastening of the rate of cooling, or a greater similarity between the freezing points of the mixed substances. It will also depend upon the pro portion of the ingredients, for it will be more difficult for a crystal to form when its constituent molecules must find their way out of a large mass of a foreign medium, and such a crystal after so forming will be more likely to contain a certain propor tion of the associated substances. Under unfavorable circum stances, as when the rate of cooling is rapid, or when the substances have nearly the same freezing temperature, or when they have an affinity for each other, the differentiation may be so much interfered with that there is no appreciable separation of the components. All these unfavorable conditions are present in the solidifi cation of steel. M\u00ab9)"], [198, "170 MANUFACTURE of structural steel. First ; the temperature of a charge, when it is poured from a converter or from a furnace, is seldom more than 50\u00b0 C. above the point of incipient congelation. Second; the absolute temperature is so high, when com pared with everything with which it comes in contact, that both conduction and radiation proceed with excessive rapidity. Third ; in the manufacture of ingots for plates, beams, angles, and other rolled or hammered structural material, it is the universal practice to cast the steel in direct contact with a thick iron mold, and the absorption of heat from the outside of the liquid is so rapid that a solid envelope is almost instantly formed, while the conducting power of this envelope is so great that the heat is continually carried from the interior to the surface. Fourth ; the different substances that compose the steel have so many strong affinities for each other, and combine in so many ways, that it is a gratuitous hypothesis to assume the exist ence of a definite carbide, or sulphide, or phosphide of iron, or a carbide, sulphide, or phosphide of manganese. Xo matter how high or how low the content of metalloids in the steel, there is always a tendency toward the separation of crystals which are lower in carbon, sulphur, and phos phorus than the average, so that it is logical to conclude that there is a tendency for pure iron to crystallize, but that this is prevented by the strong affinity it has for carbon, sulphur, phosphorus, silicon, manganese, and copper. This affinity, taken in conjunction with the rapid cooling, almost prevents the differentiation until a very thick envelope has formed on the outside of the ingot to check the loss of heat, Moreover the process of segregation is self-corrective to some extent, since with every step in the contamination of the interior liquid there is an increasing tendency to the formation of impure crystals. The liquid center is not entirely homogeneous, for, as the impurities are eliminated from the solidifying envelope, they form alloys or compounds which are more fusible and of lower specific gravity than the steel itself, so that they float on the surface of the interior lake. As the level of the metal sinks during solidification, this scum will be deposited as"], [199, "SEGREGATION and homogeneity. 171 a film on the walls of the pipe cavity, while the history will end by the solidification of a highly impure mass in the apex of the inverted cone. When there is only a small proportion of sulphur, or phos phorus, or carbon, their hold is so firm that the iron can not tear itself away, but when present in larger proportion the affinity of the surplus is weaker. This will explain why the tendency to segregation increases with an increase in the content of metalloids. Manganese, copper, and nickel do not come into this class, for their chemical similarity to iron prevents their separation. Under ordinary circumstances the extent of the purification is so slight that it reduces the content of impurities in any part of the ingot but very little below the average, even though it may result in the serious contamination of the small region which is the last to solidify. This arises from the fact that the surplus is concentrated in a very small quantity of steel. Thus, if the ingot weighs 4000 pounds and contains 0.50 per cent, of carbon, the first 3900 pounds of steel which solidifies should contain 19.5 pounds of carbon, while the last 100 pounds should contain only 0.5 pounds. But if there is a separation of two per cent, of the impurities during the chilling of the 3900 pounds, then this first portion will hold only 19.5 \u2014 0.39 = 19.11 pounds of carbon, being a content of 0.49 per cent. The last 100 pounds will hold not only its fair proportion of 0.5 pounds of carbon, but also the 0.39 pounds rejected by the earlier solidifying part, and it will therefore contain 0.89 per cent, of carbon. Thus a considerable degree of irregularity can be accounted for without assuming any attempt on the part of the metalloids to isolate themselves from the iron, but by supposing a regular separation of iron in obedience to the fundamental laws of crystallization. It has been stated that in addition to this simple history of the elimination of iron there is probably a definite process of separation and liquation on the part of the metalloids, which sometimes makes itself known in the formation of a very impure spot in the center of the mass. The exact circum stances under which this occurs to an excessive degree are not known. It is true that slow cooling aids in the work, and"], [200, "172 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. that the most marked cases are found in large masses of metal, but it is also true that both these conditions may exist without any marked irregularity. The separation of the metalloids probably does not take place to any great extent until the external envelope of the ingot is of a considerable thickness, so that cooling is retarded. When it does occur, the compounds which are formed, being lighter than the mother metal, rise to the top, thereby mak ing the upper part of the ingot somewhat richer in metalloids than the normal. It will also follow that the lower part of the ingot will contain less than the average content of alloyed elements, since whatever excess is in the top must have been taken from the bottom. For this reason the center of an ingot is not always homo geneous, but this irregularity is considerably lessened in the subsequent working of the steel, particularly if it is heated for a long time, as in the case of large ingots, and also if it under goes two different heatings a^id coolings, as in the case of ingots which are first rolled into slabs or blooms, and then reheated to be rolled into plates or angles. During each heating and rolling and cooling there must be a redistribu tion and equalization of carbon in obedience to the laws of cementation, and since the largest ingots are kept longest in the heating furnaces, it follows that this one condition of larger mass, which is favorable to segregation, is partially self corrective. The best-known paper on the irregularity of steel is by Pourcel*, but, unfortunately, it reads like an ex parte argu ment to prove that because some steels exhibit serious irregu larities, therefore all steels have the same fault. It is not my intention to err in the opposite direction and attempt to dis prove segregation because some steels are homogeneous, but I shall try to show that the facts are not all on the wrong side when viewed from a practical standpoint, For instance, millions of tons of rails have been made, con taining three or four times the amount of carbon that is usually present in structural steel, and consequently presenting ten- * Segregation and itx Consequences in Ingots of Steel and Iron.

E., Vol. XXII, p. 105."], [201, "173 SEGREGATION AND HOMOGENEITY. fold the opportunity for segregation, and these rails have also contained more phosphorus than should be found in the best quality of angles, plates, or shapes. Notwithstanding that no attempt has been made to remove any segregated portion of the ingot, there have been very few, if any, failures of rails which can be ascribed to the liquation of the metalloids. Some rails have been laminated, some have shown hard spots due to insufficient mixing of the recar burizer, some have been too high in phosphorus, carbon, or manganese, some have been overheated, and many more have been broken from lack of a proper roadbed, but segregation has never taken definite shape in the rail manufacture. I shall try to show that all steels do not exhibit excessive concentration of impurities, that the highly segregated portions of an ingot are often very small isolated areas in the interior of the mass, and that by.using a steel of low phos phorus it may safely be assumed that the finished material is practically uniform. Table 49. Example of Extreme Segregation in Pipe Cavity ; from Pourcel, loc. cit. Sec 105. \u2014 Examples of segregation in steel castings. \u2014 The most extreme instances of irregularity would naturally be expected in large masses of steel which have been cast in sand, and which have thus cooled very slowly and quietly. In the paper above mentioned, Pourcel states that in the pipe cavity of such a casting a cake of metal was discovered which seemed to be separate from the surrounding walls. The composition of this formation, together with that of the walls of the pipe cavity and of the mother metal, is given in Table 49. It should be noted in this connection that the original metal contained a much higher proportion of phosphorus than should be present in steel castings, so that the conditions were favorable to segregation.

As testimony in an opposite direction, I found no evidence of segregation in a steel roll made by The Pennsylvania Steel Company. This was a plain cylinder 20 inches in diameter, with a total length of 13 feet. A piece four feet long was cut from the top, this amount having been added for a sink-head, and samples of the metal were taken at different depths as the cutting progressed from the outside to the central axis. There were no signs of piping at this point, so that the con ditions are not exactly similar to those just cited from Pour cel, but inasmuch as the general practice is to remove all the honeycombed portion of such a casting, the investigation seems to be in the line of practical work. The results of analysis are given in Table 50. Table 50. Composition of a 20-inch Steel Roll, cast in Sand, made by The Pennsylvania Steel Company, 1893. Sec 106. \u2014 Examples of segregation in ingots cast in iron molds. \u2014 Under the ordinary system of plate manufacture, as carried out in most American works, an ingot is rolled directly into a plate at one heat, and when the sheets are of ordinarily large size, the weight of each ingot is arranged to give just one plate. It is of great importance to find whether such ingots are uniform throughout, and Table 51 gives the results of investigations which have been made under my supervision. Under another system of plate rolling, as practiced at some American mills, and more extensively abroad, it is the prac tice to make larger ingots which are rolled into slabs, these latter being reheated for the plate train. It would natur ally be supposed that these slabs would show greater segre gation phenomena than are found in ordinary plate ingots, but this assumption is hardly sustained by Table 52, which gives the results obtained by drilling into the axial line of slabs rolled from large ingots, made by The Pennsylvania Steel Works.

The concentration shown in these cases probably marks the extent of the action of simple crys tallization, while more extreme cases would represent the liquation of small quantities of fusible impure compounds. The content of carbon is not given, for a color determination is worthless when an accurate comparison is to be made, while in the present case the probability of error is unusually great, since the condition of the carbon will not be alike in the center and on the outside of a slab, owing to the difference in the rate of cooling. On the other hand, the estimation by combustion is so tedious that it is not always practicable to make such a large number of analyses. Table 51. Examples of Segregation in Plate Ingots.

This will be shown by Table 54, which gives the results obtained by testing the edge and the middle of several uni- Tersal-mill plates which were made from slabs from the same ingot. A careful record was kept of the position of each slab, and the tests were cut from the top end of each plate. Thus the list of tests from the successive plates gives the same information as if one long slab had been rolled into one plate and had then been cut up for testing. The segregation in the central axis is shown by a slightly higher content of metalloids, and by a higher tensile strength, but the variations between parts of the same plate, and the variations between different plates, are much less than is shown in Table 53 for plates rolled directly from ingots. The usual way of testing is to take a strip from a corner of the plate, and Table 55 gives the records so obtained from one- Table 55.

The plates of any one heat are all of one thickness, the discard of other sizes accounting for the many missing members. In each case the order in the list follows the order in the ingot from top to bottom, and it will be seen that, as a rule, the plates from the top give a slightly higher strength than those from the bottom, but that the variations are unimportant, not being as great as will often be found in different parts of a single plate rolled from an ordinary plate ingot.

Group A is made up of pieces showing the highest carbons in the heat, and Group B of those showing the lowest. The carbon determinations in Table 55 are inaccurate since they were made by the color method. The work was per formed by men who are regularly engaged in doing nothing else, and without any attempt at extra care, but in order to see whether there really were any such differences in com position as the records would indicate, the samples showing the widest variations in three heats were reworked twice by color and once by combustion ; the results are given in Table Composition; percent.

This would indicate that the differences are due to irregularities in rolling and to determinative errors rather than to any inherent variations in the character of the metal. In further proof of this, drillings were taken from the three annealed bars of heat 10168 which showed the highest tensile strength, and from the three which were the weakest. The results of analysis are given in Table 56A. Table 56A. Composition of Rivet Rods from Heat 10168, which showed the Greatest Differences in the Tensile Strength of the Annealed Bars. The ingots from which these rivet rods were made measured 16\"x20\" in cross section and weighed about two tons each. In the case of angles it is the practice at the Pennsylvania Steel Works to roll a larger ingot than is used elsewhere for the same purpose, the cross section being 24\"x26\", and the weight about 5 tons. In order to test the uniformity of the material, the blooms from several such ingots were stamped so as to denote from what part of the ingot each one came, and drillings were taken from the corresponding finished angles. The results of analysis are given in Table 57, and they show that each ingot was practically uniform throughout. The drillings were taken so as to include the center of the bar, which is the most impure portion. In each case the first bloom in the list is the top of the ingot, and the last is the bottom ; the varying number of blooms in the ingots arises from the different weight of the angles to be made.

The sulphur and phosphorus are very regular, the variations in the purer metal being almost within the limits of error. In the ingot of medium phosphorus, the percentage of variation is no more than in the others, but the actual range is greater.

In order to have some evidence upon this point, an investigation was conducted on an ingot of nickel steel made by The Pennsyl vania Steel Company. The cross section of the ingot was 18\"x20\", and the weight about 5500 pounds. This was rolled into a piece 16 inches wide, 5 inches thick, and 20 feet long, and cut into five slabs. The top slab was rolled into a three-eighth-inch universal plate, the second slab into a three-eighth-inch sheared plate, the third slab into a half inch universal plate, the fourth slab into a half-inch sheared plate, and the fifth slab was hammered into a bloom and then rolled into 6\"x4\" angles.

It will be seen that there are evidences of segregation, both in a slightly higher tensile strength and in higher phosphorus and sulphur, in the center of the ingot near the top, but the differences are unimportant, and in view of the fact that the carbon in the steel was .24 per cent., there seems to be good ground for the assumption that nickel prevents the separation of the metalloids. It has not prevented it altogether, how ever, and it is not probable that any other agent will ever be found competent for this task. The burden of the testimony given in this chapter is to the effect that segregation is an ever-present factor ; that the extent of the concentration bears a certain relation to the proportion of impurities that are present ; that manganese, copper, and nickel, do not segregate to any extent, but that certain portions of the finished material will contain a higher percentage of carbon, phosphorus, and sulphur than will be found in the tests cut from the edge of plates and bars, or than will be shown by an analysis of the preliminary test.

INFLUENCE OF HOT WORKING ON STEEL. Section 111. \u2014 Effect of thickness upon the physical properties. \u2014 One of the fundamental difficulties in writing specifications is to decide the nature of the test-piece to be required, inas much as the strength and ductility will vary in pieces of different thickness, while the results will not be alike in tests cut from different structural shapes, like plates, angles, and rounds, even though they be rolled from the same steel. From one point of view each piece of metal throughout a bridge should be of exactly the same strength per unit of section without regard to its thickness ; but in taking this as a basis a serious trouble is encountered. Suppose, for instance, that a metal is required running between 56000 and 64000 pounds per square inch, and a charge is made which in three-eighth inch plate gives 57000 pounds. If this steel be rolled into seven-eighth-inch angles, or into one-inch plate, or into two inch rounds, it is quite probable that these will run below the allowable minimum. On the other hand, if the steel gives 62000 pounds in a preliminary test, the larger sections will give proper results, while one-quarter-inch plate will be too high in ultimate strength. Where a structure is to be made of large quantities of very large or very small sections, it is well to specify that the test shall be made on the special thicknesses needed, but in ordinary cases it seems absurd to the practical mind that a heat of steel can be perfectly suitable for one size and unsuit able for another. It was the custom in the past for inspectors to recognize the situation and make tests from the usual sizes, with a full knowledge that thicker and thinner members would give different results, but in later practice there is a"], [221, "INFLUENCE OF HOT WORKING ON STEEL. 193 growing tendency to test each separate thickness, a change which has been the cause of great expense to the manufac turer. Provisions to cover this point should be incorporated into contracts and a certain definite allowance made so that manufacturers would be obliged to put sufficient work on large members to render them of proper structure, and would at the same time be prevented from finishing thin pieces at too low a temperature. There is often a confusion of terms in considering the effect of work as represented by a large percentage of reduction from the ingot, and the effect of finishing at a low tempera ture. This is found most often in the case of plates, for it has been quite a general practice to roll these direct from the ingot in one heat. In order that a piece shall be finished hot enough under this practice, there has been a standing tempta tion to use a thin ingot ; but, on the other hand, it has been almost universally shown that the best results are obtained when a large amount of work is put upon the piece during rolling. Sec. 112. \u2014 Discussion of Riley's investigations on the effect of work. \u2014 The truth of this last statement was disputed by Eiley,* who tabulated the results of testing different thick nesses of plate when rolled from ingots of varying section. In all cases the ingot was either hammered or cogged to a slab and this was reheated before finishing into a plate. His analysis of the records consisted in picking out individual cases and showing that the small ingots gave some results which were equal to those from the large ones, but this method of comparison must be recognized as entirely unworthy of the subject. It is true that the number of tests is very small, and it would not be surprising if the accidental variations in the double working should produce anomalous results ; but even taking these very data and making comparisons by the proper system of averages, it will be found that they tell a story exactly opposite from the conclusions formulated by Mr. Riley. In Tables 62 and 63 such figures are presented. In the comparison of the different thicknesses in Table 62 the thinner plates give much better results, the one-half-inch *Some Investigations as to the Effects of Different Methods of Treatment of Mild, Steel in the Manufacture of Plates. Journal I. and S. I., Vol. I, '1887, p. 121."], [222, "194 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. plate showing an increased ductility in spite of its greater strength. The one-quarter-inch plates are somewhat lower in elongation and two and one-half per cent, better in reduc tion of area than the one-inch plates, but they possess 7600 pounds more strength, so that less ductility should be expected. This statement is open to criticism, as no account is taken of the effect of variation in the dimensions of the test-piece, but Table 63, which is free from this error, proves that the plates made from the large sizes have a higher tensile strength and greater ductility.

Average Physical Results on Plates from Different-Sized Ingots Without Regard to Thickness of Plate ; There Being the Same Number of Each Thickness Rolled from a Given Size.f Thus these experiments which were heralded as upsetting current beliefs are found to vindicate them ; they do prove that in some cases very good results may be obtained by skillful manipulation under a bad system ; but manufacturers have long since learned that a large amount of reduction is essential to secure reliable results in regular practice, and no short series of tests can upset this well-established fact. * + From data in Journal I. and S.

Sec. 113. \u2014 Amount of work necessary to obtain good results. \u2014 In America it has not been the general custom in making large plates to take two heats on the steel, but it will be evi dent that when a heavy ingot is rolled down to a thin plate there will either be an enormous strain on the machinery or a cold-finished piece. The effect of this cold finish is very irregular, for the edges and ends are most seriously affected, and the plate is in a bad physical condition. To avoid, on the one hand, the objectionable cold finish, and to gain on the other the advantage of sufficient work, the practice has been gaining ground of rolling a large ingot into a slab which is proportioned to the plate to be made. By this method all thicknesses may be finished at about the same temperature without respect to the total amount of work put upon the ingot. It is difficult to say just what the intermediate size should be for a given plate. Theoretically it would seem immaterial whether a 15-inch ingot, is cogged to 8 inches and rolled to one-half inch, or whether it is cogged to 4 inches and rolled to the same thickness. The experiments of Mr. Riley point the same way, but they are far from being com prehensive. If a slab 4 inches thick is not heated to a full heat the plate may be finished at the same temperature as one of the same gauge rolled from a hotter slab of twice the thickness, but in regular practice the thin slabs are sometimes heated hotter than the thick ones, and consequently will be finished at a higher temperature. If carried too far this produces a coarser structure and an inferior metal, so that it is best to proportion the thickness of the slab to the thickness of the plate. The exact relation is of little importance as long as the reduction is sufficient, for in this matter the old adage is strictly applicable : \" enough is as good as a feast.\" This will be shown by Tables 64 and 65, which investigate the effect of work on billets made from ingots 16 inches square and which thus had an all-sufficient reduction to begin with. It will be found from a detailed comparison of these tables that there is little difference between the bars of the same thickness, even though rolled from different-sized billets. There is a gain in ultimate strength as the thickness decreases, this being most marked in the cold-finished bars, but the differences are not very marked except in the case of"], [224, "196 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. the one-eighth inch. The elastic limit follows the same law, but it is raised more than the ultimate as the bar gets thinner. The elongation varies irregularly, but, as a rule, it remains unaffected except in the one-eighth inch, where it is lowered to some extent. The reduction of area is also irregular, but it seems to be independent of the thickness even in the thin nest plate. The conclusion seems justifiable that if the billets have already received sufficient work, the good condi tion caused thereby is not destroyed by reheating, since bars Table 64. Influence of Thickness of Test-Piece on the Physical Proper- ties when the Percentage of Reduction in Rolling is Constant for all Thicknesses ; the Finished Bars in each Case having a Sectional Area of About 8 Per Cent, of the Billet. rolled from them reach their standard level of quality with only a reasonable degree of reduction, as proven by the fact that further work gives no decided improvement. But it is also certain, as shown by all experience, that no harm can be done by increased work, and that there is a slight gain in the long run provided the finishing temperature remains constant. 3* 9 O 3 a Ultij strer lbs. pi int nate igth; ?r sq. :h.

In the bar M, which should be compared with the bar C-, it is shown that reheat ing and hammering will do very much toward restoring a piece of burned steel to its original condition, although it is doubtful whether it ever can make of it a thoroughly reliable material.

For making the 6\"x6\" angles, a bloom 8\"x9_\" was rolled from a 16\"x20\" ingot, but all other sizes were made from a 7_-ineh square bloom which was cogged from a 16\"xl6\" ingot. The term \"small\" angles includes 4_\"x3\", 4\"x4\", and all smaller sizes down to and including 3\"x3\" ; while the \" large\" embraces from 5\"x3\" to 6\"x6\", inclusive. The finished area of the smaller bars is such a small part of the original hloom that the reduction may be considered uniform for them all, thus giving a fairly valid basis of comparison for the differ ent thicknesses, while the columns \" large\" and \" small\" should show the effect of a varying amount of work on a piece of given thickness. It will be noted that the small-sized angles give slightly better results on elongation, but the difference is trifling, while in neither the elastic ratio nor the reduction of area is there any marked superiority. The results indicate that when tin* amount of work is large, the exact percentage is of little consequence. The ultimate strength decreases in the thicker angles, but it is not proven that the variation is due entirely to the thickness, for it may be that the heats which were rolled into thick sizes did happen to be of lower strength, but as all the heats were made in the same way, and as both large and small sizes follow the same law, and as each group includes fifty bars, it seems probable that the gradation represents in some measure the effect of different amounts of work on the material. Sec. 116. \u2014 Comparison of the strength of angles with that of the preliminary test-piece. \u2014 That the thin angles will give a higher strength is proven quite conclusively by Table 68, which gives in parallel columns the tests on the finished angles from acid open-hearth heats, and the results obtained from bars rolled from 6-inch square ingots of the same charges. It matters not whether this preliminary test really represents the true value of the steel, for it may reasonably be assumed that it will give a regular basis of comparison, so that the differences between the results on this standard and on the various thicknesses will be the measure of the effect of rolling. It is shown that for an increase of one-eighth of an inch"], [229, "INFLUENCE OF HOT WORKING ON STEEL. 201 in thickness there is a diminution in strength of 700 pounds per square inch. It is, perhaps, as close an agreement as could be expected when we find that in Table 67 the difference on the large sizes between the three-eighth inch and three quarter-inch angles was 1830 pounds per square inch, or 610 pounds to every one-eighth in thickness, while on the smaller sizes it is 2168 pounds from five-sixteenth inch to five-eighth inch, or 434 pounds to every eighth, being an average of 522 pounds for both large and small sizes.

The accidental variations in the metals make it impossible to compare the influence of the thickness upon the ultimate strength, but the column show ing the elastic ratio proves that a lower elastic limit follows an increase in thickness. The elongation remains the same for all thicknesses. The reduction of area varies somewhat, but in the groups where a large number of tests make the figures of much value there is a decrease in the heavier bars. The variation in strength of the different thicknesses is due in part to the fact that the thin pieces are finished at a lower temperature.

In the bars finished at the lower tempera ture the elastic limit was raised very considerably, but the ultimate strength and the ductility did not vary much from the hot-rolled bars. This conclusion has nothing to do with the fact so well known to all manufacturers that if a bar or plate is finished so cool that it looks dark in the sunlight it will give a much higher tensile strength ; the bars referred to in the table were all finished somewhat hotter than this, and the small variation in temperature seems to have little effect. These conclusions will be corroborated by Table 70, which records certain tests on acid open-hearth steel. Table 69.

A guide round is made in one pass from an ellipse, while a hand round is put through the same pass several times, being turned one-quarter way each time in order to obtain a true circular section. This has the effect of finishing the bar somewhat cooler than a guide round, and thus naturally gives a higher ultimate strength, while it also works the skin of the piece during the finishing process without, any great reduction in diameter. It will be seen that nothing is gained by this operation, for, although the guide rounds arc slightly reduced in strength, they are considerably better in elonga tion and reduction of area. Table 72.

In the case of plates, on the contrary, there is often a considerable variation, and Table 72 investigates the effect of such differences upon the physical qualities. Table 73. Changes in the Physical Properties of Steel by Variations in the Details of Plate-Rolling; Classified According to Strength of Finished Plate. It is assumed that the preliminary test-piece is the standard, and whatever difference from this is shown in the plate is due to the conditions of rolling. On this basis it is possible to com pare those plates which show a great with those which show a less variation from the standard, and note the correspond ing ductility.

The same rule was followed in all the other divisions. Table 73 gives a different view of the same data, the groups being divided on the less logical but more practical basis of the strength of the finished plate. It will be seen that the elongation for a given tensile strength is not seriously affected by the variations in rolling, but that the hotter finished plates are somewhat better. The elastic ratio exhibits much less variation than would be expected, and this might throw some doubt on the results, but all the different groups teach the same lesson, and in some of them the number of heats is so large as to give great weight to the conclusion. The plates were all rolled from slabs, which in turn had been rolled from large ingots, so that there was ample work on all thicknesses. Table 74.

This may be explained by the fact that the metal receives a less thorough compression in the plate train than it does in the rolling of angles, in which latter case it undergoes a certain amount of lateral thrust. Sec. 121. \u2014 Effect of thickness on the physical p>roperties of plates. \u2014 The effects caused by variations in rolling tempera ture appear in their most marked degree in the comparison of plates of different gauges. It is not customary to test the same heat in several sizes, but by long experience the manu facturer is able to judge the relative properties of each thick ness. The heads of two widely-known plate mills have given me as their estimate that, taking one-half inch as a basis, there will be the following changes in the physical properties for every increase of one-quarter inch in thickness : (1) A decrease in ultimate strength of 1000 pounds per square inch. (2) A decrease in elongation of one per cent, when measured in an 8-inch parallel section. (3) A decrease in reduction of area of two per cent. W. R. Webster* gives the same data on ultimate strength, but does not mention the relation of section to elongation. It is, therefore, plain that in the writing of specifications some allowance must be made for these conditions, since a requirement which is perfectly proper for a three-eighth-inch plate will be unreasonable for a l.-inch. Moreover, the effect is cumulative, since a harder steel must be used in making the thick plate and this will tend to lessen the ductility rather than make up for the reduction caused by the larger section. In plates below three-eighth inch in * Observations on the Relations between ihe Chemical Constitution and Ultimate Strength of Steel. Journal I. and S. I., Vol. I, 1894, p. 829."], [236, "208 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. thickness it is also necessary to make allowances, since it is almost impossible to finish them at a high temperature, and the test will give a high ultimate strength and a low ductility. These conditions have now been officially recognized by the United States Government, for the rules of the Board of Supervising Inspectors, issued February 19, 1896, contain the following clause : \" The sample must show, when tested, an elongation of at least, 25 per cent, in a length of two inches for thicknesses up to one-quarter inch, inclusive ; and in a length of four inches, for over one-quarter to seven-sixteenths, inclusive ; and in a length of eight inches, for over seven-sixteenths to one-inch, inclusive ; and in a length of six inches, for all thicknesses over one-inch.\" It is to be hoped that constructive engineers will follow this example in recognizing the influence of causes over which the manufacturer has no control."], [237, "209 CHAPTER XV. ANNEALING. Section 122. \u2014 Effect of annealing on the physical properties of rolled bars. \u2014 It is a well-known fact that annealing tends to remove the strains which are created by cold rolling and distortion, but it is not generally understood how profound are the changes produced. Table 75 will show the results obtained on rounds and flats by comparing the natural bar with the annealed specimen when all the pieces were rolled from billets of the same size and on the same mill. The reheat ing was done in a muffle heated by a soft-coal fire, the bar being withdrawn when it had reached a dull yellow heat. This is the practice which was followed in other experiments related in this chapter. The decrease in ultimate strength by annealing the Besse mer bars averaged 4175 pounds per square inch in the rounds and 5683 pounds in the flats, while the open-hearth was lowered 5134 pounds in the rounds and 7649 in the flats. In this important and fundamental quality the two kinds of steel are very similarly affected, but in other particulars there seems to be a radical difference which is difficult to explain. The elongation of the Bessemer steel is increased by anneal ing in every case except, two, the average being 1.33 per cent., while the open-hearth metal shows a loss in three cases, with an average loss for all cases of 0.21 per cent. This is not very con clusive, but there is a more marked difference in the reduction of area, for in the Bessemer steel there is an increase in the annealed bar in every case varying from 7 to 15.18 per cent., while the open-hearth showed an increase in only three cases, the maximum being 2.81 per cent., and a decrease in five cases, the greatest loss being 7.20 per cent."], [238, "210 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL.

The difference between the Bessemer and open-hearth steels can not be due to irregular finishing, since all the bars were rolled at the same time, and further experiments given in Table 78 indicate that the same law holds good whether the metal is finished hot or cold. In the bars which are finished at the usual temperature there is a loss in strength due to annealing of from 6000 to 9000 pounds per square inch, and a lowering in the elastic limit of from 8000 to 11000 pounds. In the colder finished bars the loss in strength is from 8000 to 11000 pounds and the elastic limit is lowered from 8000 to 13000 pounds.

On the contrary, the foregoing tests have shown that very little is gained in ductility, while there is quite a loss in working strength, and -that it would be better and much cheaper to choose a softer steel in its natural state.

It is plain that there is a great gain in the elonga tion, but the reduction of area is unaffected and there is a decided loss in elastic and ultimate strength. Sec. 128. \u2014 Methods of annealing. \u2014 A different view of the subject is taken by Gus. 0. Henning.* He states that steel is injured by annealing if it is in contact with flame, while it is improved if it is reheated in a sealed muffle. I cannot assent, to this broad conclusion, for, while it may be true that, a flame can be run too hot and the piece be burned through carelessness, it by no means follows that such local overheat ing is necessary ; nor is there any ground for assuming the absorption of deleterious gases from a proper flame. More over, the figures which he gives do not show a decided improve ment of any kind in the bars which were heated in a retort. Table 82. Comparative Tests of Eye-Bar Steel. It is stated (loc. cit., p. 577) that most of the \" flats\" were \"properly\" annealed, and so I have averaged the records which he gives of the natural and the reheated pieces, separating them into three groups according to thickness. The results are given in Table 83. It will be seen that the metal has undergone very little change at all, and it is impossible to see anything which can be called a radical improvement.

Since the manufacturer may always manipu late the operation so as to affect the test-pieces in preference to the rest of the steel, and since it will be to his interest to keep the temperature as low as possible to avoid warping, there will be no certainty either that the work has been properly carried out or that it has been of the least advantage. Table 83. Comparative Physical Properties of Natural and Annealed Flat Steel Bars: as given by Henning.* Annealing is useful in removing the strains caused by distortion, for in such cases the gain in safety more than counterbalances the risk of loss of strength, but it may be accepted as a general rule that steel is in its best condition when it leaves the rolling mill ; that the shop treatment should retain, as far as possible, the natural qualities of the metal ; and that the bar should be heated only when it is necessary to make a permanent bend. * Trans. Amer. Soc. Mech. Eng., Vol. XIII, p. 586, et seq. The factor which Mr. Henning calls the \" yield point \" is here called the elastic limit. I have omitted from the averages the tests which are noted in the original as being wrongly marked, and also three tests which show such extremely low elongation that it is certain the material was not properly treated, or that there is an error in the records. \u00a9 u \u00a9 '3, 0 fa \u00a9 a s 73 4-i 2- -- A -.1 is DO og P -id \u00a9 2.5 \u00a9 IM C\" <! a p o p o \u20223 o o 43 hP \u2014 X '- - ax a r.

THE HISTORY AND SHAPE OF THE TEST-PIECE. Section 129. \u2014 Differences in physical properties betioeen the surface and the interior of toorked steel. \u2014 The first question that arises in the inspection of steel is the manner in which the test-piece shall be taken. In former days it was the custom to carefully plane or turn a piece to a standard size, with a certain length between shoulders and a certain radius for the terminal fillets ; but this method is both tedious and expen sive with no corresponding advantages. It is still used in steel castings, for it is impossible to cast a bar of sufficiently accurate section to be fit for a tensile test, and it is also used in the case of forgings where the piece is too large to be broken in full section, and when it is deemed advisable to carve a piece from the finished material. In all other work the test is either a part of the finished bar, as in the case of small rounds and flats, or is cut from the member, as in the case of angles, channels, etc., with two sides of the piece in the condition in which they left the rolls. A sufficient length is taken to allow about 10 inches between jaws, and the readings are made on an 8-inch length which is defined by marks of a center-punch. A machined piece is generally inferior to a bar as it leaves the rolls. It is true that Table 71 shows no gain in ductility from continued stretching or polishing of the skin, but this is an entirely different matter from the full compression which the outer surface of a bar receives in the last pass. In a series of tests made at Chester, Pa., by the United States Government* in 1885, the machine was not powerful enough to pull a seven- * Report of the Naval Advisory Board on the Mild Steel used in the Construction of the Dolphin, Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago; 1885, pp. 81, 82."], [248, "220 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. eighth-inch round, so that rods of this size were turned down to three-quarter inch in diameter. The comparative results are given in Table 84, the figures in each case representing the average of 11 heats which were tested in both diameters. Table 84. Comparative Physical Properties of f-inch Rolled Rounds in their Natural State, and |-inch Rounds of the Same Heats Turned Down to f-inch. The pieces cut from the seven-eighth-inch bar are evidently inferior to the three-quarter-inch tests, although it will be shown in Table 94 that the larger bar should give the better elongation. It is probable that the inferiority is due to the removal of the best part of the piece in the operation of turn ing. This phenomenon is more marked in larger sizes, as will be shown by Table 85, which gives the results on bars cut from forged bridge-pins. Table 85.

These results display considerable uniformity in the higher strength of the test bars which were rolled from the large ingot, but the number of specimens is not sufficient to fully establish the fact. Such a comparison is often invalidated by certain unknown factors, for if the test bar be finished hot and the \" flat\" cold, the relation may be reversed. Table 8T shows the comparative results on nine heats of steel made at one of our large steel works, and will illustrate how widely the preliminary test may differ from the finished bar in indi vidual cases, while the average of the two is nearly the same. In the light of such facts it seems absurd to reject a heat of steel because the preliminary test falls a few hundred pounds below an arbitrary standard. Table 86.

Sec. 131. \u2014 Comparison of longitudinal and transverse test pieces from sheared plates. \u2014 Striking differences may also be found between strips cut lengthwise from a plate and those cut crosswise. In steel imperfectly worked the variation is very marked. Mr. A. E. Hunt, whose opinion is entitled to great weight, states in a private communication that \"in plates up to 30 inches wide there is ordinarily a difference of 10 per cent, in tensile strength, and even up to 20 or 25 per cent, in ductility in favor of pieces cut with the grain. In wide plates the difference is not as marked on account of the effect of the cross-rolling.\" Table 87. Comparison of Strips Cut from Eye-Bar Flats with the Preliminary Test. I believe that these differences will be less in plates rolled from a slab than in those made directly from an ingot. In any event, it is quite certain that plates can be made by the first method which exhibit practically the same properties in both directions. This will be shown by Table 88, which gives the averages of 100 plates which were rolled from Pennsylvania Steel Company slabs by The Paxton Rolling Mills, Harrisburg, Pa.

The difference is very much less, but I believe its existence will be shown by.the following records. At a certain works it was the custom to cut two tests from one plate of each heat and pull one piece in a section 2 inches long and 1_ inches wide, with shoulders on each end, while trie other piece was pulled in a parallel-sided section 8 inches long and 3 inches wide.

All plates were rolled direct from the Ingot at one heat. It will be a revelation to some engineers that such wide variations can exist in plates, but it will be evident that they are more apt to occur in plates rolled direct from an ingot than in those made from a slab.

It will be shown by Table 95 that the width of the piece has very little effect upon the strength, so that these records give evidence of the reinforcement of the 2-inch test from the shoulders at the ends. Sec 134. \u2014 Use of the preliminary test-piece as a standard. \u2014 Granting that the test is to be made on a parallel-sided piece, and knowing also, as proven in Section 115, that the results on different-sized bars will be practically uniform as long as they are made from a large ingot and bloom, it has been proposed that the steel be tested by making what is known as a \"preliminary test,\" by which is meant a trial bar, either round or flat, rolled from a small ingot. Mr. A. E. Hunt, of The Pittsburg Testing Laboratory, formerly* advocated this system, but he has recently! changed his opinion. It is the custom at Steelton to make such a preliminary test on every charge, but this is done merely to classify the metal. If the bar is rolled under proper conditions, its ultimate strength represents the ultimate strength of the finished material, and without regard to any results on elongation or other qualities, the steel is used or laid aside. We are perfectly willing that the inspectors should see all the results, but we claim that these records have nothing to do with the acceptance or rejection of the material. In other words, this test is our own work while the business of the inspector is to test the material that he buys as fully and carefully as he may wish, without regard to whether a small test ingot has or has not fulfilled certain requirements, or whether it has been made at all. Our experience in comparing results from the preliminary test with those from the finished material, differs radically from that recorded by Mr. Hunt, + although we agree on the * The Inspection of Materials of Construction in the United States. Journal I. and S. I., Vol. II, 1890, p. 316. f See discussion of my paper on Specifications for Structural Steel. Trans. Amer. Soc.

Table 91 compares the data obtained from a large number of charges of acid open-hearth steel having a tensile strength between 56,000 and 64,000 pounds per square inch. They were all rolled into angles and the charges are grouped according to the thickness of the finished material. Table 91. Comparison of Strips, cut from Angles, with the Preliminary Test. The great inferiority of the tests from the 6-inch ingot is easily explained. It is very difficult to cast small ingots so that they shall not be scrappy, and the bars rolled from them will oftentimes contain flaws ; consequently we break down the ingot to a billet two inches square and chip out the flaws, after which the piece is reheated and gives a perfect bar. It does not receive sufficient work to ensure good elongation, but this is of no consequence, for it is only the strength of the material which is under investigation, and in this respect the results are found to be strictly comparable with the finished material. Sec 135. \u2014 Comparative physical propierties of rounds and flats. \u2014 It has been mentioned that the properties of a flat bar are different from those of a round, and it will not be unprofit able to investigate the relation.

(1) The amount of reduction from the bloom or ingot should not, play too great a part in the problem, for it is the duty of the manufacturer to so conduct the operation that every piece, no matter how large, shall have sufficient work. But it must be considered that a large section, a 9-inch round for example, can not possibly be finished under the same thorough and permeative compression that can be put upon a bar only one inch in diameter or upon a thin flat. (2) It is the business of the rolling mill to so arrange that every piece is rolled at a proper temperature, but it will be recognized as impracticable to finish bars of all diameters and thicknesses under identically the same conditions. (3) The shape of the test-piece has an influence upon the nature of the results, but it is often difficult to isolate this relation from the effect of work and finishing temperature. The separation of these three intertwining influences is a complicated problem, the nature of which will be illustrated by Table 92, which gives the results obtained from a large number of heats by cutting two billets from the same ingot and rolling one into a round and the other into a flat. All the lessons of this table are not written on its face, but an examination discloses the following facts : (1) Taking into consideration both natural and annealed bars, there are 18 comparisons between rounds and flats. The ultimate strength is less in the flat in every case. The elastic limit falls in 17 cases, and the gain in the exception is slight. The elongation is raised in 16 cases, while in the two exceptions the loss is small. The reduction of area is lowered in 14 cases and raised in four. The elastic ratio is lowered in 15 cases, while in the exceptions the increase is small. (2) Comparing the loss of strength in passing from round to flat, there are nine possible comparisons between the loss in the natural bar and the loss in the annealed piece. The ulti mate strength falls more in every case in the annealed than it does in the natural bar. The elastic limit falls in six cases and rises to a much less extent in three. The elongation rises in five cases and falls in four. The reduction of area falls in all cases. The elastic ratio falls in five cases and rises in four. It will be found also that the exceptions and irregularities are not confined to any one kind of steel, so that it would"], [256, "228 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. seem proper to average the losses and gains in order to eliminate the errors due to the small number of heats in some of the groups. The results of such condensation are given in Table 93, which shows the true average of all the heats and not the average of the groups. Table 92. Comparative Physical Properties of f-inch Rounds and 2x|-inch Flats Rolled from the Same Billet. All bars were rolled from a Ixl-inch billet on tin- Bame mill.

The effect of the finishing temperature may be ignored in the case of the annealed pieces, and yet there is a difference of 24_S pounds per square inch in ultimate strength between the flat and round. Table 93. Comparative Physical Properties of Round and Flat Bars in the Natural and Annealed States. The natural bars show less difference, which would indicate that the effect of the finishing temperature has raised the strength of the flat more than the round. This is contrary to the condition just noted that the reduction in rolling was less in the case of the flat, but it is in accord with the evident fact that a thin bar would cool faster than a round bar of some what less sectional area. The effect of the finishing tempera ture, therefore, was to raise the tensile strength of the flat more than it did the round, but not enough to overcome the difference in physical properties caused by the shape of the bars. The reduction of area is less in the case of the flat, and the difference is more marked in the annealed than in the natural bars.

The net result may be summarized as follows : (1) Flat bars differ from rounds in having less tensile strength, lower elastic limit, lower elastic ratio, greater elongation, and a slightly lower reduction of area. (2) This difference is caused not by reason of a different finishing temperature, but in spite of it. Table 94.

All the charges were of the same quality of steel, ranging from .11 to .15 per cent, in carbon, .02 to .04 per cent, in phosphorus, and .022 to .03$ per cent, in sulphur. The number of heats given in the table would not be sufficient to justify a general conclusion if there were only a single bar of each heat, but it will be noted that each figure is the average of from 4 to 16 determinations. In the com parison of the three-quarter and seven-eighth-inch rounds there were 112 tests of the smaller size and 94 of the larger, while in the comparison of the five-eighth and three-quarter inch there were 32 tests of the former and 34 of the latter. No average is given where less than four tests were taken of the same size from the same heat. Comparing the seven-eighth inch with the three-quarter inch bars, it will be found that in the larger size the follow ing changes occurred : (1) The ultimate strength was lowered in ten heats and raised in one, the average showing a decrease of 1426 pounds per square inch. (2) The elastic limit was lowered in all cases, the average showing a decrease of 1381 pounds per square inch ; the elastic ratio was reduced from 66.5 per cent, to 65.7 per cent. (3) The elongation was raised in ten cases and lowered in one, the average showing an increase of 0.99 per cent. (4) The reduction of area was lowered in seven heats and raised in four, the average showing a decrease of 1.08 per cent. Comparing the five-eighth and three-quarter inch, it will be found that in the larger size the following alterations have taken place : (1) The ultimate strength was lowered in three heats and raised a trifling amount in one, the average showing a decrease of 1114 pounds per square inch. (2) The elastic limit was lowered in three cases and raised in one, the average showing a decrease of 1454 pounds per square inch ; the elastic ratio was reduced from 68.7 per cent. to 67.5 per cent."], [260, "232 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. (3) The elongation was raised in every case, the average showing an increase of 0.55 per cent. (4) The reduction of area was lowered in three heats and raised in one, the average showing a decrease of 1.07 per cent. The consistent testimony of these records is corroborated by the data on the larger diameters. It is true that only one heat is given on each of these sizes, but it so happens thai there were from twelve to sixteen bars in each case, and as the steel was of the same manufacture in all particulars the results may be accepted as fairly comparable. It seems quite certain that larger bars will give a lower ultimate strength, a lower elastic limit, a lower elastic ratio, a better elongation, and a lower reduction of area. Some of these characteristics may be due to differences in finishing temperature, but the data on elastic limits show that the pieces were all rolled at nearly the same degree of heat, and such small variations, even if due entirely to rolling conditions, are not sufficient to account for the increase in the elongation. This subject of variation in physical qualities, as produced by differences in diameter, has been discussed by Appleby.* In common with many others, he makes the vital and funda mental mistake of rolling all the bars to one size, viz. : 1 . inches in diameter, and turning the test specimens from these bars. It will be evident that a test-piece of one-half inch in diameter thus obtained will be merely the core or center of the original bar, and will be inferior both chemically and physic ally. On the one hand it embraces the area of maximum segregation, while on the other it has not undergone the thorough compression that the exterior of the bar has received in the rolls or under the hammer, and a comparison of the bars is therefore invalid. The method, which I have employed in this section, of comparing rolled bars of different sizes in the form in which they left the rolls, also presents some complicating conditions, inasmuch as the effect of work is not the same on large and on small sections, but it has the overwhelming advantage that it represents actual conditions, and portrays the exact results that may be expected in practice. \u2666Proe.

It must be kept in mind that no comparison can be made between the different thicknesses, since the individual heats were not the same. In the matter of widths, however, the case is otherwise, for every heat in the group was tested in all the widths, the bars from each heat being cut from the same small strip of plate, and this should give a perfectly valid basis of comparison.

(1) Variations in the width of the test-piece have very little effect upon the ultimate strength per square inch. (2) They probably have little influence upon the elastic limit. The narrowest pieces show a decided increase, but this needs corroboration. The three-inch pieces were polled at the works of the Pottstown Iron Company, being beyond the capacity of the machine at Steelton, and the determina tions of elastic limit are therefore not comparable. (3) The elongation increases regularly as the width in creases. (4) The reduction of area decreases regularly as the width increases. The same subject was investigated by Barba,* his results being given in Table 96. Table 96. Influence upon the Elongation of Changes in the Width of the Test-Piece (Barba). The figures seem to show a continual increase in elongation until the width is six times the thickness, after which the stretch grows less. This latter point is not an important matter in practice since there is no occasion to use such a wide section, and in the case of plates of ordinary thickness the strength of such pieces is beyond the capacity of most machines. The increase in elongation in greater widths has also been shown by E. A. Ouster, of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, Philadelphia, Pa., who has given me in a private communication the results obtained by him in testing strips from boiler plate. * Resistance des Maleriaux; Mimoires de la Societe des Ingenieurs Civils.

Effect of an Increase of Width upon the Elongation.* Sec 138. \u2014 Influence of a change in length upon the physical properties. \u2014 In order to determine the relative elongation with varying length, I have carried out the following investi gation : Twenty rods, three-quarter inch in diameter, were selected from one heat of acid open-hearth steel. From each rod seven bars were cut, one of which was tested in a length of 2 inches, and one each in 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 inches. The results are given in Table 98. The individual records of elongation are shown to prove that the averages are not formed by the combination of unlike members. These data are plotted in Curve AA, Figure XV. A similar series of tests was made by Barba, f the results being given in Table 99, and plotted in Curve BB, Figure XV. The linear elongation of a fractured bar is made up of two factors. First, the excessive stretch in the immediate neighborhood of the break, due to the deformation known as \"necking.\" Second, the \"permanent set\" which occurs throughout the rest of the bar. It will be plain that the first factor will bear a greater ratio to the sum total as the length grows less, while it will bear a less ratio as the length increases. It will therefore follow that if the length of the piece is reduced so that it is all included in the region of necking, as, for instance, when the piece is only 2 inches * E. A.

On the other hand, when the length in increased beyond 14 inches, the ratio of the first factor to the second is not great and consequently the change in total percentage with each linear increment is not marked. Table 98 Influence upon the Physical Properties of Changes in the Length of the Test-Piece. 3^-inch rounds; Pennsylvania Steel Company acid open-hearth rivet steel. If the length were zero the percentage of elongation would be infinite, while if the length were infinite the percentage of extension would be represented by the permanent set of those portions of the bar where no necking occurs. The true curve therefore expressing the law of relative elongation is un doubtedly an hyperbola, one asymptote of which will correspond to a length of zero, while the other will be the percentage due to the permanent set, which will vary with every kind of steel.

Table 99. Influence upon the Elongation of Changes in the Length of the Test-Piece* The percentage of elongation in the portion of the piece which does not undergo \" necking\" may be calculated from the records in Table 98. As a matter of experience it is found that a length of about two inches includes the region wherein necking occurs, and this length is a constant, no matter what the total length of the test-piece may be. In other words, a test-piece two inches long is practically all \" neck,\" while in one four inches long there will be one length of two inches which is all neck, and another length of two inches which will remain nearly a true cylinder after fracture. In the case of the 2-inch test-pieces, given in Table 98, the average elongation was 47.43 per cent., representing a linear elongation of 0.9486 inches. In the case of the 4-inch test pieces the stretch, by the above assumption, was the same in the necked region, while the total elongation was 36.11 per cent., representing a linear elongation of 1.4444 inches.

The rate of distortion, therefore, was nearly four times as great in the 2-inch test as in the 14-inch bar, and this condition would give a slightly higher elongation with each decrease in length, as shown in Section 142.^ Owing to this complication it is impossible to deduce a theoretically accurate answer from the foregoing data, but it may be considered as practically demonstrated that in a three-quarter-inch round bar of infinite length, of the same steel as shown in Table 98, the elongation would be about 24 per cent. Sec. 139. \u2014 Tests on eye-bars. \u2014 Through the courtesy of The Union Bridge Company, Athens, Pa., I have had access to its records of eye-bar tests, and have classified them in various ways to determine the influence of width, thickness, and length upon the physical properties. The steel was made by different manufacturers, and it was necessary to divide the bars on that basis. Some works were represented by such a small number of bars that it was thought best to omit them from the list as well as the bars from a foreign works which gave results quite inferior to those of domestic manu facture. There were also cancelled all bars which showed 100 per cent, crystalline fracture, and pieces of miscellaneous lengths when there were less than three bars of the same steel in the group. A few pieces were discarded when the percentage of elongation in 12 inches was the same as in the full length, for this indicates either a clerical error or that fracture took place in the eye. After these eliminations it was found that only three works were represented, two of them by both open-hearth and Bessemer steel. The records are given in Table 100, and they show that there is no radical difference in the character of the metal furnished by the three makers, or between the two methods of manufacture. This does not disprove the state ment already emphasized that Bessemer metal is more"], [269, "241 HISTORY AXD SHAPE OF THE TEST-PIECE. Table 100.

Thus Table 100 shows 83 bars that are classed as \"wide and thin\" and as having a tensile strength between 54000 and 64000 pounds, while Table 101 gives only 72 bars. This arises from the fact that some of the 83 bars were shorter than 13 feet or longer than 30 feet, and that there was not a sufficient number of any one size to warrant combining them to make an average. It is evident that the elongation in 12 inches and the reduction of area will be quite independent of the length of the bar, so that each of the divisions is again summarized in the true averages A, B, C, and D. The influence of width will be found by comparing A with B, and (7 with D, and the influence of thickness by comparing A with C, and B with D. It is shown that the average elongation in 12 inches of the wider bars is about 3 per cent, better than the narrow pieces, while the narrow bars are superior in reduction of area. It is also indicated that the thick bars give about one per cent, more elongation, but that the difference in thickness does not seem to have a marked cr regular effect upon the reduction of area. The differences are not extreme in any case, and it is always unsafe in such investigations to formulate general laws from an average which may be the combination of positive and negative values, but by analyzing the individual records of the table it will be seen that corroborative evidence is at hand of the correctness of the averages. Referring to the groups by the numbers in the first column, there are seven comparisons for width, viz.: 1 to 6, 2 to 7, 3 to 8, 4 to 9, 10 to 15, 11 to 16, 12 to 17 ; there are seven comparisons for thickness, viz. : 2 to 10, 3 to 11, 4 to 12, 6 to 14, 7 to 15, 8 to 16, 9 to 17. Inspection shows that in every case the wider and the thicker pieces gave the greater elongation in 12 inches. The narrow pieces gave the better reduction of area in every case except one, and in this instance the difference was trifling. In thickness the results on reduction of area are contradictory, there being three cases where the thin bars were superior and four cases where the thick were better. It seems quite certain that either an increase in width or an increase in thickness improves the elongation in the 12 inches that includes the fracture, but that the reduction of area is improved in much less measure or not at all."], [272, "244 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. Applying the same method of inspection to the records of elongation in full length, it will be found that the wide bins were superior in four cases and inferior in three cases, while the thick bars were superior in five cases and inferior in two cases. Thus there seems to be quite a difference between the records of full-length tests and those from 12-inch lengths, so that it is justifiable to conclude that while wider and thicker Inns do give greater elongation after fracture, the advantage is confined to the region of the \" necking,\" and the percentage of stretch throughout the body of the bar is independent of the section. If this is true, it is a most important fact and has a wide application in structural engineering. Table 102. Physical Properties of Eye-Bars, Classified According to Length ; Being the Same Bars Referred to in Tables 100 and 101. Since it has been thus shown that there is very little, if any, difference in the percentage of elongation in pieces of the same length, although they be of different section, it becomes possible to further combine the records by putting together all widths and thicknesses and classifying by length alone. This is done in Table 102. It may be noticed that there are 41 bars running between 10 and 12 feet in length, while in Table 101 there are only 18 of this size. This arises from the fact that there were a few of this length in each of the groups as classified by section, but they were not in sufficient number to be of value for comparison except in the case of Group 13 (see Table 101). In Table 102 these scattering bars are combined with those of Group 13 in order to have a larger v, 43 C8 91 a o a \"a s2 \u00a7a fe\" a- 91 .- \"S- og m iz Z SO z\" go nog a .- -S1 sio \u00a35 x<\u2014 > o < \u2014 i CD X \u2014 - t- a Zxxx e-xo.0 \u00ab f~ 91 99 \u2014 Z 99 t. f a 3 Ci - 0 FJ1 F\" O P.S <! .FJF3 j aa t- P t- U ~- .Z z - a .- aS . : 9t - ri a a s.2 8 sal H & - - -. \u2014 2 C u -au...

The results are plotted in Figure XVII, which thus shows the law of elongation in long bars. A further point to be considered is the proportion of bars that fall below a given standard, since an average may be made up of widely different kinds of metal or it may be made from a uniform product. In Table 103 is given an analysis of the records showing the number and percentage of bars in each division which give less than a certain per centage of elongation.

The standards assumed are those which are specified for different grades of structural steel in Chapter XVIII.

Sec 140. \u2014 Alterations in the physical properties of steel by rest after rolling. \u2014 In addition to the variations which may be caused by differences in the working of the test-piece and in its shape, there is probably another factor in the length of time which elapses between rolling and testing. This subject was investigated at The Pennsylvania Steel Works by E. C. Felton,* General Manager of the Company, a condensation of Table 104. Alteration in the Physical Properties of Steel by Rest after Rolling, f whose work is given in Table 104. The changes are not very strongly marked, but there seems to be consistent testimony of a molecular rearrangement, progressing for several hours after the bar is thoroughly cold, whereby there is a lowering of the elastic limit, and an increase in the ultimate strength, the elongation, and the reduction of area. *-rNotes on Results Obtained from Steel Tested Shortly after Rolling.

Sec. 141. \u2014 Probable error in current practice in determin ing the physical properties. \u2014 It is the rule in most practi cal work that at least two sides of the test-piece are not machined, and hence it is impossible to make a perfectly accurate measurement. In order to find how great an effect may be caused by such errors and by differences in machines and the method of operating them, the experiment was tried of sending a bar from six different acid open-hearth heats to six different testing laboratories. The pieces were rolled fiats, 2\"x|\", and each series was made up of one piece from each of the six bars, so that the only possible difference between the steel sent to the various places would be the difference between parts of the same bar. All pieces were tested in the shape in which they left the rolls without any machining, and although the edges were not perfectly smooth, they were so nearly true that only one operator referred to any difficulty in making a true measure ment. Table 105 exhibits the results reported. The liars were tested by The Central Iron and Steel Works, Harrisburg, Pa., The Baldwin Locomotive Works, Philadelphia, Pa., The Potts town Iron Company, Pottstown, Pa., The Carnegie Steel Com pany, Pittsburg, Pa., The Carbon Steel Company, Pittsburg, Pa., and The Pennsylvania Steel Companya Steelton, Pa., but the identity of the different works is purposely concealed in the table under the letters A, B, C, etc., to avoid invidious com parisons. An examination will show that there are quite important variations in every one of the factors. Moreover, the diver gence is not the result of averaging erratic individuals, for whenever one average is higher than another, it is because the majority of the bars are higher when taken separately. The variations in contraction of area may easily be explained, for the determination rests upon the most accurate measurements of an irregular broken body. In a bar having an original section of 2\"x|\" , the fractured end will have a thickness of about 0.20 inch, and almost invariably will be of irregular form, the sides being concave rather than flat. A true estimation of the broken area could be made only by the most careful duplicate readings and by the aid of the calculus."], [277, "HISTORY AND SHAPE OF THE TEST-PIECE. 249 These refinements are out of the question in practice, but the chances of error must always be considered when a test bar falls a little short of the requirements. Table 105. Physical Properties of the Same Bars of Steel, as Determined by Different Laboratories.

This method has been criticized by some investigators, who advocate an autographic device for registering the point where the elongation ceases to be exactly proportionate to the load. The introduction of such a system would result in endless confusion, since all specifications and contracts of the present day are based upon the elastic limit as now determined by the fall of the beam. The statement that the current method is especially inaccu rate is open to debate. In the series of tests given in Table 105, it will be found that the elongation, as determined by different observers, varies from 29.50 to 31.46 per cent., these figures being in the ratio of 100 to 106.6, or a range of error of 6.6 per cent. The reduction of area varies from 53.8 to 61.6 per cent., a ratio of 100 to 114.5, or a range of error of 14.5 per cent. The elastic ratio varies fro*ni 63.2 to 69.1 per cent., a ratio of 100 to 109.3, or a range of error of 9.3 per cent. Thus the determination of the elastic ratio is much more accurate than the results on contraction of area, and nearly as accurate as the results on elongation, both of which are determined by exact measurements made on the piece when at rest. It would be quite in order for reformers to apply their energies to the accurate determination of the reduction of area and the elongation, instead of trying to substitute a new method for determining the elastic limit, especially when this method has been publicly branded as inaccurate.* As a rule the autographic device gives a slightly lower reading than is found by the drop of the beam ; thus in a paper by Gus. C. Henning-f there are given the determina tions of the elastic limit on a series of tests, as found by the two methods. I have averaged the list of heats where both readings are given, and find that in thirty-eight cases the autographic record was 46.6 per cent, of the ultimate strength, while the beam dropped at 52.9 per cent. ; in the annealed bar the first method gave 51.6 per cent., and the second 56.9 per cent. \"Lewis.

Custer, who at the time was connected with The Baldwin Locomotive Works, Philadelphia, Pa. In the case of the slow speed there is less difference between the two determinations of the elastic limit than is shown by Henning, while with the fast speed there is more. This matter of the influence of the pulling speed upon the recorded physical properties is considered in the next section. Table 106. Parallel Determinations of the Elastic Limit by the Auto- graphic Device and by the Drop of the Beam.* The whole subject of the determination of the elastic limit was discussed in The Engineering News, of July 25, 1895. After reviewing at great length the arguments presented by several engineers in previous issues, and after quoting from many authorities, the following conclusions were reached : \" Having thus shown the impossibility of determining by micrometric measurement the elastic limit, when it is defined as the point at which the rate of stretch begins to change, and the extreme variability of the position of the so-called 'yield point' with the method of running the machine and with the method of measuring and recording results, had we not better drop these new definitions and methods of attempting to locate points whose position is so extremely variable, and whose determination depends so largely upon the personal equation of the observer, and return to the good, old-fashioned definitions and methods? If for scientific purposes there is any need for determining microscopically that point at which the rate of stretch begins microscopically to change, let us call that point the ' limit of proportionality,' as Bauschinger did, and leave its determination to the college professors. * From E.

Since the term ' yield point' is quite recent, and it has no meaning essentially different from the words 'elastic limit' in time-honored practice, why need it be used at all ?\" These conclusions represent common sense in their sum mary dealing with the petty theories of enthusiasts, who are so wrapped up in the accurate determination of a micrometri cal measurement that they ignore the more important varia tions inherent in the method itself, not to mention the still more overwhelming differences caused by changes in the history and shape of the material. I do not see, however, why it is necessary to revert to the primitive and laborious method of driving a machine by hand when there is a power attachment with different pulleys. The speed should be lower during the determination of the elastic limit than can be used for breaking the piece, but a specification that this work must be done by hand is a confession of lack of inge nuity which is not creditable to engineering science, and which is not justified by facts. Sec. 142. \u2014 Effect of variations in the pulling speed of the testing machine upon the recorded physical properties. \u2014 To find the effect of variations in pulling speed, ten different rivet rods were taken from an acid open-hearth heat. From each rod five bars were cut, and each one of these was broken at a different speed. The results are given in Table 107.

This point is not of great practical importance, since it requires nearly an hour to break a single bar of ductile steel at this speed. The reduction of area seems to remain practically constant throughout the series. The natural result of this investigation would be a tendency toward higher breaking speeds. It is believed, however, that this may lie carried too far, since with fast work it is more difficult to take accurate readings."], [283, "255 CHAPTER XVIT. THE INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF STEEL. Section 143. \u2014 Difficulties attending the quantitative valua tion of alloyed elements. \u2014 Numerous investigations have been conducted to discover the influence of different elements on the strength and ductility of steel, a common method being to melt definite combinations in crucibles and ascribe the physical result to the known variables, under the assumption that all other things are equal. This system of experiment will answer in noting the effect of large proportions of certain elements, or in showing- the qualitative influence of unusual ingredients ; but it is worthless in the accurate quantitative valuation of minute proportions of the metalloids, since small variations in the chemical equation are masked by irregulari ties in the detail of casting and working. The problem is also complicated by numberless combinations of different percentages of the various elements, so that it is difficult to obtain groups of charges where there is only one variable. It has, therefore, not infrequently happened that inconclu sive data have been joined to bad logic, and the conclusions of special investigators have been at variance with all the teachings of experience. It is not my purpose to enumerate all the theories or deductions of experimenters, but I shall aim to give a general survey of the situation. In Part I each element is considered separately, and the views therein advanced are in accord with the general consensus of opinion among metallurgists. Parts II and III give the result of special investigations into the effect of carbon, silicon, man ganese, phosphorus, and sulphur upon the tensile strength of steel, and a determination of the strength of pure iron."], [284, "256 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL Part I. EFFECT OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS AS DETERMINED BY GENERAL EX- PERIENCE AND BT THE USUAL METHODS OF INVESTIGATION. Sec 144. \u2014 Influence of carbon. \u2014 The ordinary steel of com merce is carbon-steel ; in other words, the distinctive features of two different grades are due for the most part to variations in carbon rather than to differences in other elements. There are often wide variations in manganese, phosphorus, silicon, etc., but it is rarely that the carbon content does not determine the class in which the material belongs. This selection of carbon as the one important variable arose primarily from the fact that primitive Tuba] Cains could produce a hard cutting instrument with no apparatus save a wrought-iron bar and a pile of charcoal ; and the natural developments in manufacture have led to the conclusion that a given content of carbon will confer greater hardness and strength, with less accompanying brittle ness, than any other element. There are certain exceptions to be taken to this statement in the case of hard steels made by manganese, chromium, or tungsten, but it may be accepted as true in soft steel. It follows, therefore, that no limit should ever be placed to the carbon allowed in any structural material if a given tensile, strength is specified. It is, of course, true that every increment of carbon increases the hardness, the brittleness under shock, and the susceptibility to crack under sudden cooling and heating, while it reduces the elongation and reduction of area, but the strength must be bought at a certain cost, and this cost is less in the case of carbon than with any other element. It is not my purpose to discuss the various ways in which carbon manifests itself under different conditions of work and temperature, for, notwithstanding the learned and laborious investigations of Howe, Osmond, Hadfield, Ledebur, and others, there is a wide difference of opinion on cardinal points, and such abstruse theories regarding the molecular equation, that all save the studious metallurgist may wait for the doctors to agree. In structural steels, low in carbon, which have not been tempered or annealed, it may be assumed that all the carbon is"], [285, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 257 combined with the iron, and is in the same molecular condition in all bars. Manipulations by heating and cooling can alter this condition, the extent and nature of such changes being determined both by the temperature to which the metal is heated and the rate at which it is cooled. The chemical determinations are generally made by the color method, which does very well in current steel-works practice for rough com parison, when all bars have been heated and cooled in the same manner and the carbon is in the same molecular condi tion, but it is far from reliable, and in all disputed cases there must be an analysis by combustion. Sec 145. \u2014 Influence of silicon. \u2014 The contradictory testi mony concerning the effect of silicon on steel has been well summarized by Mr. Howe,* who records many examples of exceptional steels with abnormal contents of silicon, and who fully discusses the theories advanced by different writers. He finds no proof that silicon has any bad effect upon the ductility or toughness of steel, and he concludes that the bad quality of certain specimens is not necessarily due to the silicon content, but to other unknown conditions. A Besse mer steel with high silicon is sometimes produced by hot blowing, but it will be entirely wrong to compare such metal with the common product and ascribe all differences to the chemical formula, rather than to the circumstances which created that formula. Since the appearance of The Metallurgy, an able paper has been written by Hadfield,f who produced alloys with different contents of silicon by melting wrought-iron and ferro-silicon in crucibles. The metal was cast in ingots 2_ inches square, and these were reduced by forging to If inches square and then rolled into bars 1\\ inches in diameter. In the list of analyses in the paper referred to, there are slight differences in the composition of drillings from different bars of the same ingot, but in Table 108 I have averaged the results of each cast so as to show the nature of the material under inves tigation, and have given the physical results on the rolled bars in their natural state. Bars A, B, C, and D showed a silky fracture after breaking, * The Metallurgy of Steel, p. 36. + 0\u00bb Alloys of Iron and Silicon. Journal I. and S. I., Vol. II, 1889, p. 222."], [286, "258 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. but with higher silicon the crystallization was very coarse. They also showed no great hardening or brittleness after being quenched in water from a yellow heat, while even the higher alloys, although made quite stiff by the chilling, were not rendered very hard, and preserved a good degree of ductility. With the exception of A the ingots forged well even up to 5.5 per cent, of silicon, but all attempts at welding were unsatisfactory. Table 108. Physical Properties of Silicon Steels.* These results are of the highest value in showing that sili con can not be classed among the highly injurious elements, for in similar proportion phosphorus and sulphur would be out of the question, manganese would give a worthless metal, and carbon would change the bar to pig-iron. It will, there fore, be only reasonable to suppose that small quantities can not exert a very deleterious influence. The only bar in the table which contains a moderate content of silicon is A with .21 per cent., and it is recorded that this ingot did not forge well and did not Aveld, but it must be considered that the manganese was only .14 per cent, while the sulphur was .08 per cent, and the phosphorus .05 per cent. Assuredly, it would hardly be expected that such metal would forge very well, and it is not singular that it gave trouble, while other experimenters have forged and welded steel with similar contents of silicon when the associated elements were in proper proportion. * Condensed from Hadsteld.

In the whole series it must be considered that the amount of work done upon the ingot in reducing it from 2. inches square to 1| inches in diameter was wholly insufficient to give a proper structure, so that little weight can be attached to the determination on any one bar. This renders it difficult to calculate the exact effect of silicon, especially Bince the bars A and B present some contradictions. Thus B contains .04 per cent, more carbon than A, .07 per cent. more manganese, and .56 per cent, more silicon, and yet has only 2240 pounds more tensile strength per square inch. Table 109. Influence of Silicon on the Tensile Strength as Shown by Table 108. Inspection shows that A is probably the erratic member, for its strength is altogether too high for its composition. Moreover, the annealed bars show a loss in strength of 24 per cent, from the natural in A, while bars B, C, and D give 15, 12, and 14 per cent., respectively, so that it is likely that A is finished at too low a temperature and has a higher strength than really belongs to it. For this reason it will be set aside as abnormal, and in Table 109 the bar B is taken as a basis to investigate the differences in tensile strength. No allowance is made for manganese, since this element is fairly constant in all the specimens, but a value of 1210 pounds per square inch is given to carbon in accordance with the formula given in Table 128. After this allowance the remaining variations are ascribed to silicon, but this is not strictly correct as no data are at hand concerning the content of phosphorus, so that the answer is open to question.

This table can not be called a conclusive equation of the effect of silicon, for the carbon was determined by color instead of combustion, the number of tests is altogether too limited, and no account is taken of phosphorus, but there seems to be a strengthening effect of about 80 pounds for every .01 per cent, of silicon up to a content of four per cent., while beyond this there is a deterioration of the metal, as shown in Table 108. This would mean an increase of only 1600 pounds for .20 per cent, silicon, being one-third more than that produced by .01 per cent, of carbon. (See Table 128. ) It has already been noted that A, which was the only bar con taining an ordinary percentage of silicon, gave abnormal results in tensile strength, but this can not be due to silicon, for the elastic ratio is quite normal, the elongation fair, and the reduction of area very good.

The effect of the difference caused by elements other than silicon may be calculated from the formula given in Table 128, carbon being taken at +121 pounds for .001 per cent., and phosphorus at -4- 89. The result is as follows : Lbs. per sq. in. Group II should be stronger than Group I. On account of phosphorus, 38 X 89 3382 Group II should be weaker than Group I.

(See Table 128.) The influence of silicon upon the tensile strength is often confounded with that of carbon. It is well known that the addition of high-silicon pig-iron to a charge of low steel strengthens the metal more than a similar addition of ordinary pig-iron. But the fact is lost sight of that this silicon pre vents the burning of carbon, both by the absorption of oxygen and by the deadening of the bath, so that the resultant metal is of higher carbon. ri Ci a \u00abF 0 Li \u2022 01 ft a a **\u2022 \u00b0 a u a tc 4 3 Composition; percent.

If the ordinary color method were reliable, this would be detected and proper credit given to it, but it often happens that an increment of .03 per cent, of carbon ia mot shown by analysis, so that its effect upon the ultimate strength, which Avill amount to about 3500 pounds per square inch, will be incorrectly ascribed to whatever small percentage of silicon has survived the reactions during recarburization. This criticism on the determination of carbon applies to the data given in Tables 108 and 110, and renders the calculations thereon of limited value. These conclusions are corroborated by the testimony of Groups 49, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 60, and 61 in Table 121, as show n in Figure XVIII. All of these groups contain high silicon, but they do not seem to differ materially from the normal steels. Between the limits of 82000 and 100,000 pounds ulti mate strength there are seven groups in Table 121, Nos. 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, and 54, some containing high silicon and some with a low percentage, but the great variations do not seem to have any decided effect in altering the trend of the curve, although the contents of sulphur, phosphorus, and manganese are fairly constant. (This question is discussed more fully in Section 158. ) It is well known that many continental works have habitu ally made their rails with from .30 to .60 per cent, of silicon, and that all requirements of strength and ductility have been met. All the authorities do not approve this practice, and it is stated by Ehrenwerth,* that the latest results are rather in the opposite direction in the case of low steels, f but I was told some y*ears ago, by the manager of one of the French establishments, that the only way in which he was able to fill one contract with particularly severe specifications, was by making the rails contain from .30 to .40 per cent, of silicon, since a less proportion would not stand the drop-tests. It is not necessary to question whether this conclusion was warranted or not ; it is enough to know that the steel M*as of the best quality, whether on account of the silicon or in srfite of it. The fact that silicon may be allowed in rails has been * Das Berg- und H'dttenwesen aus der IVeltausslellung in Chicago, 1895. + See page 78, ante."], [291, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 263 acknowledged by Sandberg, who writes as follows :* \" Silicon up to .30 per cent., with carbon .30 to .40 per cent,, does not harden steel or make it brittle, and diminishes its strength in such small degree as not to imperil the safety of the rail.\" The italics in the quotation are my own, and are to call attention to the implication that silicon lowers the strength rather than raises it. Exceptional cases have been recorded of soft steels with high silicon, like the very tough rail mentioned by Snelus,f with carbon below .10 per cent, and silicon .83 per cent, It must be considered, however, that although this might have been very tough for a rail, it does not follow that it was very tough for soft steel, but it is quite certain that it could not have been bad or brittle. With the knowledge possessed concerning the relative effect of impurities upon hard and soft steels, the assumption would almost be justified that low-carbon metal might be allowed to contain a larger percentage of silicon than higher steel. There is no need, however, of such an admission, for structural steels do not often contain over .05 per cent, of silicon, while usually they hold less than .03 per cent. Tool steel is subjected to the most severe of all tests in the exposure of a hardened edge to the blows of a hammer or the shocks of a planer. It was not the laboratory but the require ments of general practice from which was unconsciously evolved the formula for such metal, requiring low phosphorus, low sulphur, and low manganese. In this process of natural selection no mention was made of silicon. It is true that some makers try to keep it as low as possible, but a large part of the best steel has regularly contained, year after year from .20 to .80 per cent, of this element, Notwithstanding all this testimony as to the harmlessness of silicon, it is firmly believed by many practical metallurgists that the presence of even .03 per cent, materially injures the quality of soft steel, such as is used for fire-boxes. I can not positively assert the contrary, but I believe that the effects ascribed to silicon may be due to the conditions of *Proc. English Inst. Mech. Eng., 189), p. 301. t On the Chemical Composition and Testing of Steel Rails. Journal I and S. I., VoL II, 1882, p. 583."], [292, "264 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. manufacture which gave rise to it, or to the conditions of casting which it produces. These conditions might be fatal under one practice, as, for instance, when ingots are rolled directly into plates, while they might lie harmless, or even beneficent, when an ingot is roughed down and reheated. The opinions of practical men are sometimes of more value than the learned conclusions of theorists, and must never be ignored, but they are not always inerrant, Sec. 146. \u2014 Influence of manganese. \u2014 Spiegel-iron or ferro manganese is added to a heat of steel at the time of tapping in order that it may seize the oxygen, which is dissolved in the bath, and transfer it to the slag as oxide of manganese; but this reaction is not perfect, as shown in Section 77, and there is reason to believe that all common steels contain a certain percentage of oxygen.* Steel low in phosphorus and sulphur requires less manganese than impure metal, although it is difficult to see why there should be less oxygen to counteract, and this indicates that the function of the manganese is to prevent the coarse crystallization which the impurities would otherwise induce. Besides conferring the quality of hot ductility, manganese also raises the critical temperature to which it is safe to heat the steel, for just as it resists the separation of the crystals in cooling from a liquid, so it opposes their formation when a high thermal altitude augments the molecular mobility. These two manifestations of the same general force render manganese one of the most valuable and essential factors in the making of steel, although there is no doubt that it has been used too freely in some cases. Years ago some of the railmakers of the country looked upon it as a panacea for all bad practices in the Bessemer and the rolling mill, and steel often contained from 1.25 to 2.00 per cent, of manganese, but it was soon discovered that such rails were brittle under shock, so that the permissible maxi mum has been gradually lowered, and the standard product of the present day contains from .70 to 1.00 per cent. In higher steels the same lesson has been learned, but in this case the necessity of a low content is far more marked, since a per centage which is perfectly harmless in unhardened steel will *See Section 153 for a further discussion on this point."], [293, "265 INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. cause cracking if the metal be quenched in water. For this reason it is advisable to reduce the proportion of this element in hard steel to the lowest possible point, In structural metal there is no quenching to be done and the line of maximum manganese need not be drawn too low. It is much more convenient for manufacturers to produce a higher tensile strength by the use of spiegel-iron, which contains manganese, than with ordinary pig-iron, since the presence of manganese deadens the metal and prevents the oxidation of the carbon. Thus it happens that an increased tensile strength resulting from the addition of more recarburizer is usually accompanied by an increase in the content of manganese, and it is cur rently assumed that a considerable part of the extra strength is due to the higher percentage of this element. In great measure this is an error, for the increase in carbon is often sufficient to account for the change. Ferro-manganese containing 80 per cent, of manganese holds about 5 per cent, of carbon, and since about one third of the manganese is lost during the reaction while very little carbon is burned, it follows that about |X80o=53 points of manganese will be added to the steel for every 5 points of carbon. Thus, if the content of manganese in any heat be raised .20 per cent, by an increase in the amount of the recarburizer, there will at the same time be an increment of ..02 per cent, of carbon. This slight change in carbon will not alwaj's be detected by the color method, particularly as an increase in manganese interferes with the accuracy of the comparison by altering the tint of the solution, and so the effect of this carbon, repre senting an increase in tensile strength of about 2400 pounds per square inch, is often ascribed to the increment of manga nese. It is necessary, therefore, to carefully compare steels where the composition is thoroughly known to find the effect of this element, and this is done in Parts II and III of this chapter. It is also currently believed that manganese reduces the ductility of steel to a great extent, but Table 112 will show that the effect is not well marked. This table is made by grouping together heats of the same general character and"], [294, "266 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. of about the same tensile strength, and separating them into two classes according to their manganese content. No arbitrary line is drawn between a high and a low percentage, but each group is divided so that the number is as nearly equal as possible on each side. An unequal number is due solely to the fact that several heats may have exactly the same content, and these must all be placed either on one or the other side of the line. Table 112. Comparative Physical Properties of Open-Hearth Steel with Different Contents of Manganese. Made by The Pennsylvania Steel Company. It will lie evident that there is no marked difference between the steels of high and low manganese, and the results of the eight different groups are so uniform in their testimony that the work of chance must be almost absent. These records of ductility, however, do not take into account the very important quality of resistance to shock.

It will be evident that the hammering did not in any case determine the time of breakage, for each piece gave as good an elongation and reduction of area as a part of the same rod which was pulled in the usual manner. It is not the intention to advocate the use of such a high con tent of manganese as is shown in Table 113. The general conclusion of metallurgists, evolved from experience, seems to point to as low a proportion as will ensure good working in the rolls. In the case of such ingots as are rolled directly into plates, the allowable content is limited by the require ment that the steel shall boil in the molds, but it does not follow because bad results accompany higher manganese in such practice, that the quality of the product is proportionally deteriorated when the ingot is roughed down and reheated. The effect of large proportions of manganese upon steel is one of the most curious phenomena in metallurgy. As the content rises over 1.5 or 2.0 per cent, the metal becomes brittle and almost worthless, and further additions do not better the matter until an alloy is reached with about 6 or 7 per cent. manganese. From this point the metal is not only extremely hard, but possesses the rather peculiar property of becoming very much tougher after quenching in water, without any great change in hardness. The physical properties of various manganese alloys is shown in Table 114, which is taken from an article by Had field,* who has made use of these valuable qualities in the making of car wheels, dredger links and pins, and other articles where the maximum of hardness must be combined with toughness. The great disadvantage of \"manganese steel\" is the impracticability of doing machine work upon it, for the best of hardened tools will crumble and wear out in contact with this metal. The usual method is to forge the piece accurately to size, while in the case of wheels a soft bushing is cast in the center and this may be bored to receive the axle. * See also The Mineral Industry, Vol. IV, for an essay on Alloys of Iron by R. A. Hadfield."], [297, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 269 Sec. 147. \u2014 Influence of sulphur. \u2014 Nothing is better estab lished than the fact that sulphur injures the rolling qualities of steel, causing it to crack and tear, and lessening its capacity to weld. This tendency can be overcome in some measure by the use of manganese and by care in heating, but this does not in the least disprove that the sulphur is at work, but simply shows that it is overpowered. The critical content at which the metal ceases to be malleable and weldable varies with every steel. It is lower with each associated increment of copper, it is higher with each unit of manganese, and it is. lower in steel which has been cast too hot. Table 114. Physical Properties of Forged Steel Containing from .83 to 21.69 Per Cent. Manganese.* In the making of common steel for simple shapes, a content of .10 per cent, is possible, and may even be exceeded if great care be taken in the heating, but for rails and other shapes having thin flanges it is advantageous to have less than .08 per cent., while every decrease below this point is seen in a reduced number of defective bars. It is impossible to pick out two steels with different contents of sulphur and say that the influence of a certain minute quantity can be detected, but it is none the less true that the effect of an increase or decrease of 'Condensed from Hadfield, Journdl I. and S.

The effect of sulphur upon the cold properties of steel has not been accurately determined, but it is quite certain that it is unimportant. In common practice the content varies from .02 to .10 per cent., and within these limits it seems to have no appreciable influence upon the elastic ratio, the elongation, or the reduction of area. It is more difficult to say that it does not alter the tensile strength, for a change of one thousand pounds per square inch can be caused by so many things that it is a bold venture to ascribe it to one vari able. Webster* has stated that sulphur probably increases the ultimate strength at the rate of 500 pounds per square inch for every .01 per cent. I am inclined to think his con clusion is not founded on sufficient premises, and shall try to prove this in Sections 161 and 163. In rivets, eyebars, and fire-box steel, the presence of sulphur is objectionable, for it will tend to create a coarse crystallization when the metal is heated to a high temperature, and reduce the strength and toughness of the steel. In other forms of structural material the effect of this element is probably of little importance. Sec 148. \u2014 Influence of pjhosj)horus. \u2014 Of all the elements that are commonly found in steel, phosphorus stands preeminent as the most undesirable. It is objectionable in the rolling mill, for it tends to produce coarse crystallization and hence lowers the temperature to which it is safe to heat the steel, and for this reason j,hosphoritic metal should be finished at a lower temj-erature than pure steel in order to prevent the formation of a crystalline structure during the cooling. Aside from these considerations its influence is not felt in a marked degree in the rolling mill, for it has no disastrous effect upon the toughness of red-hot metal when the content does not exceed .15 per cent. The action of phosphorus upon the finished material may not be dismissed in so few words. Mr. Howes has gathered together the observation of different investigators, and the * Further Observations on the Relations between the Chemical Constitution and .Physical Character of Steel. Trans. A. I. M. E., Vol. XXIII, p. 118. f The Metallurgy of Steel, p. 67, et seq."], [299, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 271 evidence seems to prove that the tensile strength is increased by each increment, of phosphorus up to a content of .12 per cent., but that beyond this point the metal is weakened. Whether this last observation be correct or not is of little practical importance, for it would be criminal to use a metal for structural purposes that contained as much as an average of .12 per cent, phosphorus. Below this point it is absolutely certain that phosphorus strengthens low steels, both acid and basic, and a quantitative valuation of its effect will be found in Parts II and III of this chapter. The same certainty does not pertain to any other effect of this metalloid. Mr. Howe* has ably discussed the whole matter, and I herewith make quotations from The Metallurgy of Steel, and place them in the form of a summary. (1) The effect of phosphorus on the elastic ratio, as on elongation and contraction, is very capricious. (2) Phosphoric steels are liable to break under very slight tensile stress if suddenly or vibratorily applied. (3) Phosphorus diminishes the ductility of steel under a gradually applied load as measured by its elongation, contrac tion, and elastic ratio when ruptured in an ordinary testing machine, but it diminishes its toughness under shock to a still greater degree, and this it is that unfits phosphoric steels for most purposes. (4) The effect of phosphorus on static ductility appears to be very capricious, for we find many cases of highly phos phoric steel which show excellent elongation, contraction, and even fair elastic ratio, while side by side with them are others produced under apparently identical conditions but statically brittle. (5) If any relation between composition and physical properties is established by experience, it is that of phos phorus in making steel brittle under shock ; and it appears reasonably certain, though exact data sufficing to demonstrate it are not at hand, that phosphoric steels are liable to be very brittle under shock, even though they may be tolerably ductile statically. The effects of phosphorus on shock-resist- * Loc. cit."], [300, "272 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. ing power, though probably more constant than its effects on static ductility, are still decidedly capricious. The difficulty of detecting a high content of phosphorus, under the ordinary system of physical tests, will be shown by Table 115, which is constructed by comparing the acid open hearth angles in Table 69, which are of the same ultimate strength and of the same thickness, but which contain differ- ent percentages of phosphorus. Table 115. Comparative Physical Properties of Low-Phosphorus and High-Phosphorus Steels ; Being a Comparison of the Acid Open-Hearth Angles Given in Table 69, which are of the Same Ultimate Strength and of the Same Thickness, but with Different Contents of Phosphorus. Analyzing this record, it will be found that the higher phosphorus gives a higher elastic ratio in all six groups, the difference ranging from 0.45 per cent, to 1.59 per cent., but the elongation and the reduction of area are almost exactly the same in the two kinds of steel. It is the difference between static and shock ductility that makes phosphoric steel so dangerous. In the ordinary testing machine there is no important difference between a pure steel containing less than .04 per cent, of phosphorus, and a common steel with .08 per cent., or a bad steel with .10 per cent.

Many a time the metallurgical world has been stirred by some new discovery whereby such metal was induced to show a high ductility in the testing machine, and each time the new process has passed away unwept, unhonored, and unsung as it was rediscovered that static and shock ductility were totally different properties, and that the high phos phorus metal gave lamentable failures as soon as it went beyond the watchful care of its parents and its nurses. It is true that numerous cases can be cited of rails, plates, etc., containing from .10 to .35 per cent, of phosphorus, which have withstood a long lifetime of wear and adversity ; but in the general use of such metal there has been such a large percentage of mysterious breakages that it seems quite well proven that the phosphorus and the mystery are the same. Much information on the effect of phosphorus may be gathered from a study of high steels. A very severe trial is put upon a cold-chisel or similar tool in the resisting of the continued shock on the sharpened edge, and it is undeniable that each increment of phosphorus has its effect in rendering such a tool brittle. It is true that in this case the steel is quenched and also that it contains a considerable proportion of carbon, but there is no evidence to show that the effect of phosphorus is different when the carbon is high, even though it be true that it is more marked. Neither is there any reason to suppose that the quenching changes its nature, for experi ments with high phosphorus steel of low carbon indicate that sudden cooling would rather counteract the influence of phos. phorus than enhance it, since it tends to prevent the formation of coarse crystals. It would seem therefore that the regularly increasing bane fulness of phosphorus as the carbon is raised does not portray any change in nature, but that although the effect of the metalloid in lower steels is obscured, its character is the same. No line can be drawn that can be called the limit of safety, since no practical test has ever been devised which com pletely represents the effect of incessant tremor. For common"], [302, "274 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL SI 1 II. structural material the critical content has been placed at .10 per cent, by general consent, but this is altogether too high for railroad bridge work. All that can be said is that safety increases as phosphorus decreases, and the engineer may calculate just how much he is willing to pay for greater protection from accident. Sec 149. \u2014 Influence of coj)j)er. \u2014 The iron made from the ores of Cornwall, Pa., contains from .75 to 1.00 per cent, of copper, and large quantities of rails have been made from this iron alone, but it has oftener been the custom at eastern steel works to use from 25 to 50 per cent, of this iron in the mixture, the rest being made from foreign ores. Other deposits contain considerable quantities of this element, notably some beds in Virginia, while the ores of Cuba give an iron with about .10 per cent, of copper. Not only has such metal been put into rails but into all kinds of steel both hard and soft, and large quantities have been worked in puddle furnaces and in foundries, so that the miscellaneous cast-iron, wrought-iron, and steel scrap, throughout the East, is very apt to contain quite an appreciable quantity of copper, and as steelmakers will thus forever have this element to handle, it is of pressing importance that its effect be understood. The necessity for such knowledge is the more marked as it is the custom in certain favored districts to inti mate that copper is injurious, although definite proof is always lacking. Most of the Bessemer steels which are recorded in this book contain from .30 to .50 per cent, of copper, while much of the open-hearth steel is of the same character, and this will be sufficient proof that the best of steel may contain a consider able proportion. If, therefore, it appears from a set of experi ments that copper exerts a bad effect, then one of two things follows : (1) That the experiments have left some factor out of the question. (2) That the maker of good steel has some trick by which he overcomes the enemy. It would be a cause for satisfaction if we could boast that the latter supposition were true, but, as a matter of fact, we"], [303, "275 INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. have never known that copper injured the cold properties of steel in any way, and it is unnecessary to add that no system has been devised to obviate its influence. Hard and soft steels of our manufacture have found their way into all channels of trade, and although many failures have come, as they have everywhere, from high carbon, high man ganese, or high phosphorus, there have been no cases where it was necessary to invoke the aid of copper. This fact out ranks and transcends in value any limited series of tests that might be given. In the same way there is no evidence that copper segregates, experience pointing rather to perfect uniformity. A story has been the rounds of the trade journals of a copper wire which crystallized out in the head of a rail, but, unfortunately, no method is known by which the phenomenon can be duplicated, since such rails might be of great value in electrical work. Steel may contain up to one per cent, of copper without being seriously affected, but if at the same time the sulphur is high, say .08 to .10 per cent., the cumulative effect is too great for molecular cohesion at high temperatures and it cracks in rolling. This tearing occurs almost entirely in the first passes of the ingot, so that it is of little importance to the engineer who is concerned only with perfect finished material. In the purest of soft steels containing not more than .04 per cent, of either phosphorus or sulphur, the influ ence of even .10 per cent, of copper may be detected in the less ready welding of seams during the process of rolling, but ordinarily when the sulphur is below .05 per cent, the copper injures the rolling quality very little, even if present in the proportion of .75 per cent. In all cases the cold properties seem to be entirely unaffected. These conclusions are not founded on any limited series of tests on special alloys ; they are the fruit of years of experi ence in the making of millions of tons of cupriferous steels, and it is quite certain that any baneful influence of this con stant companion would have been felt in the many investiga tions which have been made into the mechanical equation of structural metal. The quantitative effect of copper upon the tensile strength"], [304, "276 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. of steel was the subject of a paper by Ball and Wingham,* in which they showed that as much as seven per cent, could be alloyed to iron, and that a specimen with four per cent, forged well both hot and cold. It was found also that the alloys were very hard, so that when the content was over seven per cent. the metal could not be cut by a good tool. The experiments showed a considerable increase in tensile strength in the case of higher copper, but no great weight can be given to the determinations, for both the method of making the alloy and the cutting of the test were too crude for conclusive results. It is not easy to make a comparison between the ductility of high-copper and low-copper steels, for at works using such material it is customary to keep a fairly constant percentage in the mixture rather than to vary between wide limits. A limited number of heats have been grouped together in Table 116, and although the list is not as long as might be desired, it should be considered that the heats were all made within a short period in the same Bessemer, and were all rolled in the same mill. Table 116. Comparative Physical Properties of Low-Copper and High- Copper Steel Angles. Made by The Pennsylvania Steel Company, 1893. It will be noted that no difference is to be found in the ultimate strength between steels with high and low copper, although all the heats were made in the same way as nearly as possible, the workmen not knowing either in the Bessemer department or in the rolling mill what kind of iron was in use. * On the Influence of Copper on the Tensile Strength of Steel.

Moreover, the high copper gives a slightly higher elastic ratio, which is a benefit, and also a better elongation and reduction of area. These results can hardly be called con clusive, for the number of heats is too limited, but as the data on high-copper steels are uniform with the much larger number of similar angles given in Table 69, and as the two separate averages for low copper correspond so closely to one another after allowance is made for the two different thick nesses, it seems quite justifiable to conclude that the high copper is not in any way harmful. Sec. 150. \u2014 Influence of aluminum. \u2014 It is hardly necessary to discuss at length the effect of aluminum upon steel, for although it is often used to quiet the metal, it unites with the oxygen of the bath and passes into the slag. Sometimes a very small percentage remains in steel castings, while it is quite conceivable that other steels may receive a small over dose by mistake, so that Table 117 will be of interest as giving the results of an investigation by Hadfield.* Table 117.

Attempts at welding were unsuccessful on samples Nos. 3, 5, and 8_. After making allowances for the variations in other elements, it will be found that the aluminum has little effect upon the tensile strength, while it does not materially injure the ductility until a content of two per cent, is reached. * Aluminum Steel.

These conclusions do not agree with the results which I have found by casting different alloys in the form of six-inch square ingots. The aluminum was added in a solid state aud it is quite possible that it was not disseminated uniformly, but the analysis was made on the test bar itself, and the fusible nature of the metal makes it probable that the piece would be reasonably homogeneous. Either two or three ingots were cast from each heat, the first containing either no aluminum or only a trace, while the others were made so as to give fairly rich alloys.

These changes are as follows : (1) The addition of one-half of one per cent, of aluminum increases the tensile strength between 3000 and 8000 pounds per square inch, exalts the elastic limit in about the same propor tion, and injures very materially the elongation and contrac tion of area. The effect both upon strength and ductility is more marked in the case of low than in high steels. (2) The addition of another half of one per cent, does not have much effect upon the ultimate strength or the elastic limit, but it still further decreases the ductility of the metal. It is stated by Odelstjerna* that the use of aluminum, in the manufacture of steel castings, gives an inferior metal, even though the addition amount to only .002 per cent., and that such steel presents a peculiar fracture, the faces of the crystals being large and well defined. It must be kept in mind, how ever, that these conclusions apply to one particular kind of practice, and that the use of aluminum, under certain condi tions, may produce a most harmful effect, while under other possible conditions the result would be much less marked. Nothing is more difficult than to isolate one factor in a metallurgical equation, and to discover its real value, when it is always associated with complicating and equally powerful agencies. Sec 151. \u2014 Influence of arsenic. \u2014 The effect of arsenic upon steel was quite fully investigated several years ago by Harbord and Tucker. f The conclusions given by them may be sum marized as follows : Arsenic, in percentages not exceeding .17, does not appear to affect the bending properties at ordinary temperatures, but above this percentage cold-shortness begins to appear and rapidly increases. In amounts not exceeding .66 per cent. , the tensile strength is raised very considerably. It lowers * The Manufacture of Open-Hearth Steel in Sweden. Trans. A. I. M.

I., Vol. 1, 1888, p. 183."], [308, "280 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. the elastic limit, and decreases the elongation and reduction of area in a marked degree. It makes the steel harden much more in quenching, and injures its welding power even when only .093 per cent, is present. These results have been corroborated by J. E. Stead,* who found that between .10 and .15 per cent, of arsenic in struc tural steel has no material effect upon the mechanical proper ties ; the tenacity is but slightly increased, tbe elongation and reduction of area apparently unaffected. With .20 per cent. of arsenic, the difference is noticeable, while with larger amounts the effect is decisive. When one per cent, is present, the tenacity is increased, and the elongation and reduction of area both reduced. This increase in strength and diminution in toughness continue as the content of arsenic is raised to 4 per cent., when the elongation and reduction in area become nil. These experiments are of considerable practical importance, since a great many steels carry an appreciable proportion of arsenic. Some chemists take little cognizance of this fact, and their phosphorus determinations are often too high on account of the presence of arsenic in the phosphorus precipi tate. Other analysts take special precautions to avoid this contamination. Sec. 152. \u2014 Influence of nickel, tungsten, and chrom ium. \u2014 The first public presentation of the effect of nickel upon steel was a paper by Jas. Riley.f Since that time the properties of nickel steel have become widely known through the experi ments by the United States Government on the armor plate manufactured by The Bethlehem Iron Company, and by the Carnegie Steel Company. As it often happens in the case of a new metal, the tendency is to exaggerate its importance. In a paper read before the American Society of Civil Engineers, in June, 1895, I gave the detailed results found by testing nickel steel when rolled into rounds, angles, and plates, and compared them with the records of carbon steel of about the same tensile strength. A condensation of the work will be found in Table 119. It will be noted that the nickel steel is superior, but in * The Effect of Arsenic on Steel. Journal I. and S.

It must be kept in mind, however, that in armor plate, as in many another field, there is sometimes but a very small distance between absolute success and absolute failure, and that it matters little how much margin there is above success, pro vided there is a margin at all.

These alloys, however, do not come under the head of structural material, and will therefore not lie considered here. Sec 153. \u2014 Influence of oxide of iron. \u2014 The last step in the making of a heat of steel is the addition of the recarburizer to wash the oxygen from the bath, but this action is not per fect, and the exact relation is not generally understood. The amount of oxygen taken from the metal will evidently be measured by the amount of manganese and other metalloids that are burned during the reaction, and this amount was shown in Section 77 to be a function of the quantity which is added. In other words, if there is a reduction in the per centage of manganese which is added to an open-hearth bath at the time of tapping, there will be a reduction in the amount of manganese which will be oxidized, and this proves conclusively that the reaction is not perfect, and that an increasing amount of oxygen must remain in the metal as the content of manganese decreases ; but a reasonable pro portion of this oxygen can hardly exert any marked dele terious influence, else the fact would long ago have been known in some more definite form than the suppositions and theories which are occasionally founded on exceptional phe nomena. Assuming as certain that high oxygen will more likely be found in steels both low in manganese and in oxidizable metalloids, it may reasonably be expected that any bad effect it may exert will be seen in the softest products of the basic open-hearth and in the purest of acid steel. On the contrary, it is well known that the reverse is true, and that the ductility increases as the condition of pure iron is approached. Some people imagine that it is not well to take all the impurities out of iron, their thesis having been forcibly, though somewhat inelegantly, expressed in the saying that a shirt can be ruined by too much scrubbing. Unfortunately, the simile is entire worthless, for the purification of steel is not a process of washing, although often so called. Dephos phorization does not consist in mechanically removing certain foreign ingredients, but in placing the metal in con tact with a slag of such a character that the metalloids find in it a more congenial home, and although it is true that over-"], [311, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 283 oxidation assists the purification, it is not at all a necessary adjunct, since the transfer of allegiance may be effected by a slag moderately rich in lime, combined with the normal oxidizing influences. In a discussion of a paper by Webster, which will be referred to at length in Part II of this chapter, H. D. Hib bard* deduced the fact that oxide of iron reduces the tensile strength of very soft metal by several thousand pounds. I cannot endorse this conclusion, but offer Table 120 as evidence to the contrary. Table 120. Individual Records of Heats Composing Group 63 in Table 121 These heats were made in a basic open-hearth furnace, and their regularity both in chemical and physical character shows that we are dealing with a normal and definite metal and not with an accidental product. They were purposely made with the lowest possible content of manganese, and it seems positively certain that the steel must be saturated with oxygen. These six heats constitute Group 63 in Table 121, and by the most casual inspection, as well as by a glance at Curve AA in Figure XIX, it will be plain that these steels are much stronger than would be expected as compared with those con taining more carbon. It may be that the first increments of carbon have less strengthening effect than further additions, or it may be that the first increments of manganese have a marked weakening effect, but it is more probable that the oxide of iron increases the ultimate strength. * Trans.

Part II EFFECT OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS AS DETERMINED BY SPECIAL MATHEMATICAL INVESTIGATIONS. Introductory Note. \u2014 The sections immediately after No. 154, from 155 to 159, inclusive, may be omitted by the general reader. They discuss an investigation upon a series of steels by the method of least squares, and it was originally intended that they should close the chapter, but while the proofsheets of the book were coming from the press, the calculations were completed on an entirely new series. This new work sheds much light on some points that were obscure, and gives authority for more positive statements. This increased knowledge does not arise from any superiority of the second investigation, but simply from the fact that the basis of work was doubled, and the validity of the results cor respondingly enhanced. It has been deemed proper, therei'i ire, to omit many deductions that had been drawn from the first series, but the most important of these conclusions are given in Section 159 in precisely the form in which they were worded before the new series was contemplated. The careful student will find it necessary to read the follow ing sections to understand the steps involved, and to know why certain elements have been omitted from the formul\u00e6, but those less curious may pass to Part III, which embraces the latest investigations on both the old and the new series, while in Section 165 will lie found a synopsis of the whole argument and the conclusions drawn therefrom. Sec 154. \u2014 Investigations by Webster on the influence of the metalloids. \u2014 The most comprehensive and systematic study of the physical formula of steel has been carried out by W. R. Webster.* He has used the long and laborious method of successive approximations, and by \" cutting and trying\" has found the effect of each element upon the ultimate strength, as well as the effect of the thickness and finishing tempera ture. The results are given by him as follows : .01 per cent, of sulphur increases the tensile strength 500 pounds per square inch. * Observations on the Relations between the Chemical Constitution and Physical Character of Steel.

Mr. Webster has constructed, from these values, a table showing the strength of metal containing different propor- ions of carbon and phosphorus, from which, as a basis, the itrength of a given steel may be found by allowing for tlie \u25a0ontent of manganese and sulphur. This table presents a :urious anomaly, as will be shown by the following excerpt :* Carbon ; percent. .07 .08 I .09 .10 .11 .12 .13 .14 .15 .16 .17 .18 .08 .09 .18 = .00perct. 40350 = .03 per ct. 42750 = .06 per ot. 45150 = .10 per ct. 4s35n| 41150 41950 42750 43550 44350 45150 45950; 46750 47550 48350 4915C 43551) 4465(1 45750 46850 47950 49050 50150 51250 52050 52850 5365C 45950 47350 48750 50150 51550 52950 5135(1 55750 56550 57350 5815C 49150 5095(1 52750 54550 56350 5815(1 59950 01750 625501 63350, 6415C"], [314, "286 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. in which it is not even constantly irregular. By his own calculation a steel of .06 per cent, phosphorus and .10 per cent, carbon is strengthened 1400 por.nur; Iby the addition of .01 per cent, of carbon, while with .10 pea cent, phosphorus it is strengthened 1800 pounds by the same addition. As suredly, this is not a constant effect. Moreover, carbon does not even have a constant, effect with the same content of other metalloids, for, with .10 per cent, of phosphorus, an increase in carbon from .07 to .08 per cent, raises the strength 800 pounds, while an increase from .08 to .09 per cent. strengthens it 1800 pounds. It would be just as correct to conclude from these results that phosphorus is a constant, and carbon a variable, as to say that carbon is a constant and phosphorus a variable. The changing values which it would be necessary to assign to carbon to fulfill the first assumption would be no more arbitrary and hypothetical than tbe changing values assigned to phosphorus by Mr. Webster, or the changing values which he has assigned to manganese. Thus the table which has been given is entirely indecisive, since it can be translated into two diametrically opposite readings, and it must be acknowledged that one empirical formula is as good as another, provided the same answers are obtained from both. This curious contradiction of the premises by the conclusion can only arise from some erroneous hypothesis in the values assigned to the different elements, for in the construction of such equations it is plain that an error in one factor must be atoned for by an opposite and equal error in another factor. If this reasoning be true, then very little faith can be attached to the formula as an expression of fundamental laws, however accurately the mathematical results may coincide with obser vations. It is to be regretted that the earnest endeavor of Mr. Webster to write the physical formula should have been ham pered by the necessity of working on sheared plates, which are finished under greater variations of temperature than angles or bars, and furthermore that these plates were of basic Bessemer steel, a material which would not be chosen for its regularity. By correcting for thickness and finishing"], [315, "287 INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. temperature, Mr. Webster has shown that about 90 per cent os the heats investigated came within 5000 pounds per square inch of what his equation calls for. This is a very satisfactory result, and it is not in a spirit of hypercriticism (for my own results, to be given later, display examples of the same character), but from a strictly scientific point of view, that attention is called to the very unpleasant corollary that one charge out of every ten does not give results within 5000 pounds. Some of these undoubtedly are vitiated by wrong chemical determinations, for the carbon was determined by color, and this gives only approximate results ; on others there might well be an error in estimating the finishing temperature ; on others there would be mistakes in measuring and testing; while some pieces, perhaps, did actually show those peculiarities which we call abnormal, which are ascribed sometimes to oxide of iron, sometimes to nitrogen, and not infrequently to the devil, but which grow less numerous as we learn more of our art. I can not believe that the complicated formula of Mr. Webster represents actual conditions, and the remainder of this chapter will attempt to show that a reasonably accurate empirical equation of steel may be written without the intro duction of such manifold variations, and by the use of con stant values for each element within the limits usually obtaining in structural metal. It will also be shown that the first increments of manganese do not add greatly to the strength of steel, since low-manganese metal is stronger than would be indicated by a formula that applies to steels containing higher percentages of this element. Sec 155. \u2014 Investigations on Pennsylvania Steel Company steels by the method of averaging groups of preliminary tests. \u2014 I believe that the true way to investigate the influence of the metalloids upon the physical qualities of steel is to make groups of heats so as to avoid the determinative errors in any one charge. The method of forming these groups in the fol lowing investigation is of such importance that it is necessary to give a full description. It is the custom at The Pennsyl vania Steel Works to make a preliminary test of every open hearth heat, and it is found that this test is almost invariably a reliable exponent of the charge from which it comes. In"], [316, "288 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. the rolling of plates, angles, and miscellaneous shapes, the thickness of the piece and the finishing temperature have a great effect upon the result, but in this test-piece the condi tions of heating and working are so constant that the results as shown by the testing machine reflect only the influence of variations in the chemical equation. Having preserved the broken bars for a considerable time, there were at hand 575 pieces of acid steel below 80,000 pounds ultimate strength, 1160 pieces of basic steel below 70,000 pounds, and 145 pieces of acid steel above 80,000 pounds. In addition to the ultimate strength, the content of manganese, sulphur, and phosphorus was on record for each piece. Taking the low-acid steels as one basis of work, a further separation was made according to the tensile strength; for example, in the case of the low-acid steels there were 148 heats between 58,000 and 60,000 pounds, and these were considered a subdivision. This was again divided, the heats being arranged according to their chemical composition. Thus there were 18 heats which showed lower manganese than the rest, and these were averaged to give Group 8 in Table 121. There were 13 heats showing high manganese, and these gave Group 16. The low-sulphur heats gave Group 24, the high sulphur Group 17. The low phosphorus gave Group 25, the high phosphorus Group 19, while there were 72 heats which did not show a high content of any element, and these form Group 15. Oftentimes it would happen that a charge which contained high manganese would show either a low or a high percentage of some other element, and hence would appear in two or more groups, so that the total number of heats in the table is larger than the number of test-pieces. After forming these groups, the average manganese, sul phur, phosphorus, and ultimate strength of each were calcu lated from the records, while the average carbon, silicon, and copper were determined by weighing an equal quantity of drillings from each bar and making a chemical analysis, the carbon being determined by combustion. Since each member of a group contained nearly the same percentage of carbon, it is evident that very little error is introduced by this system of average, while it assuredly tends to hide the idiosyncrasies of any one heat."], [317, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 289 Table 121.

If this last assumption be true, then the seemingly erratic deviations of the curves in Figure XVIII and Figure XIX from a straight line are due to variations in the associated percentages of silicon, manganese, sulphur, phosphorus, and copper. It seems possible to find the effect of these elements by the method of least squares. Each group may be regarded as an equation containing seven unknown quantities, the combined effect of which produces a certain ultimate strength. If A is written for the effect of .001 per cent, of carbon upon the ultimate strength, B for silicon, C for manganese, D for sulphur, E for phosphorus, F for copper, and G for iron, then Group I will take the following form : 82A+6B+290C+34D+34E+1-20F+ 994.*o*4 G = 52090. Similarly the 47 groups of low-acid steels furnish 47 equations of condition, as they are called, and from these may be deduced seven normal equations containing seven unknown quantities."], [322, "294 manufacture of structural steel. These normal equations being solved by ordinary algebraic methods give the values of A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, which will most nearly fit the original equations of condition. The method by which the normal equations are deduced is explained in the following formula : Multiply each equation by the coefficient of A in that equa tion, then add together the resulting equations for a neio equa tion; then multiply each equation by the coefficient o/B in that equation, and, as before, form the su?n ofthe resulting equations. Continue the process with the coefficients of each of the unknown quantities. The number of resulting normal equations ivill be equal to that of the unknown quantities, and the values of the unknown quantities deduced therefrom will, as above stated, be the most jirobable values.

These equations have been worked out without the use of logarithms and are absolutely accurate, since the conditions of the problem render possible a perfect proof. The iron being determined by difference, it follows that the sum of the coefficients in each equation of condition is 100,000, and since each coefficient in each equation is successively multiplied by every other one in the same equation to form new coefficients, it follows that the sum of the resultant coefficients for each equation of condition must be the square of 100,000, while the sum of all the equations derived from the 47 equations of con dition will be 47 times this number, or 470,000,000,000, and this is exactly the sum of all the coefficients in the above seven normal equations."], [323, "influence of certain elements on steel. 295 In the subsequent work of finding the values of the unknown quantities it is out of the question to sustain this strict accuracy, as by the continual combination of terms the final step would involve the multiplication of two numbers, each of which would contain nearly 150 integers. Seven-place logarithm tallies have therefore been used, and seven integers have been kept in all corresponding numbers. This care is necessary in determining seven unknown quantities, since the number of operations is so great that the accumulated logarithmic error is of considerable importance. It is necessary also to keep in mind that the iron is deter mined by difference, so that it must bear all the inaccuracies that occur in the determination of the other elements. Moreover, it is a false assumption that this \"difference\" is entirely made up of pure iron, for there are certain appreci able portions of oxygen and arsenic, with traces of other elements like nickel, cobalt, nitrogen, etc. It is difficult to say how much this fact impairs the value of the results. Following is the result of the solution for the low acid open hearth heats, the number in each case expressing the effect of .001 per cent, of the element upon the tensile strength, in pounds per square inch. Carbon = + 135.6419; Silicon = + 71.75700. Manganese = \u2014 2.066108; Sulphur = \u2014 37.77523. Phosphorus = + 117.6217; Copper = + 7.389871. Iron = + 0.3655429. The values are given in each case to seven figures, although at first sight this may seem an absurd refinement. It must be remembered, however, that although the original groups contain large determinative errors, the normal equations con stitute an accurate mathematical problem, and that the figures just given should be such that they satisfy the original equations of condition more nearly than any other possible set of values. This is equivalent to saying that if they be substituted in the 47 groups of Division I, Table 121, the sum total of the errors should be zero. The formula actually used in Table 121 is not the formula just given, since for reasons to be explained later I have dis carded the results of operating upon seven variables, and taken cognizance of only four elements. I have, however, made the trial of applying the above values to the groups in Division I"], [324, "296 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. and find that the sum of the plus and minus errors is 29 pounds, being an average error of only one-half a pound to each group, which is very close to mathematical accuracy. The true way of proving the correctness of values deduced from such a series of equations is first to eliminate in the order G, F, E, D, C, B, A, and then in the order A, B, C, D, E, F, G, to see if the two sets of answers agree; but as each such double solution, when every step of the work is proven to avoid error, consumes nearly two weeks of steady work, this reverse process has not been carried out in every one of the cases herein recorded. It has, however, been used to cor roborate the following less tedious method of proof which is described for the benefit of future investigators. The process of elimination is performed according to the following chart, where each figure represents an equation, and each bracket the combination of two equations by multi plication and subtraction. \u25a0> e> 2\\ y >*\\ /** 9-v y i9\\ 3\\ y 158. y 23>w / I0\\ / 20-\\ 26\\ 4\\ y I6\\ x> 248. / \"\\ / 2I\\ X* 27 \u25a05\\ / I7\\ x> 25 / u\\ y 22 6\\ / 18 /> 13 7 Chart Showing Method of Determining Seven Unknown Quantities in Seven Equations. After the determination of the final factor in equation No. 28, the value of each element is successively determined by substitution in Nos. 26, 23, 19, 14, 8, and 1. After the last unknown is thus found the values are substituted in No. 7, and if it is then found that the results agree to the seventh or even to the sixth logarithmic place, it may confidently be asserted that the values are correct to the third and sometimes to the fourth integer, and this is amply sufficient for the work in hand. Notwithstanding such methods of proof and the reasonable,"], [325, "influence of certain elements on steel. 297 although in some respects the unexpected, nature of the results just given from Division I, it is with no little disap pointment that I am forced to confess that further investiga tion throws grave doubts on the validity of this method of least squares when applied to such a number of unknown quantities, and when any one of these quantities is of very little importance. The reasons for this conclusion will appear in the results shown in Table 122, which were obtained from the normal equations derived from the groups composing Division II. Table 122.

After laborious attempts to find any mathematical error, I am certain that the discrepancies between the results found by solving in reverse order are due solely to logarithmic errors, and could only be lessened by using logarithm tables of more than seven places. But these errors are of no import ance, and it is certain that the values are approximately correct mathematically speaking, although they are absurd from a practical point of view.

Phosphorus is shown as a minus quantity, which is entirely wrong, and copper is given at \u2014 29 pounds, which is equivalent to saying that one-half of one per cent, would reduce the strength 14,500 pounds, when, in fact, a content of even one per cent, does not seem to have any effect at all. These ridiculous values place in question the validity of the method of least squares, by which they were determined, and the next section will attempt to survey the territory over which it has jurisdiction. Sec 157. \u2014 Application of the method of least squares as limited by the conditions of the problem. \u2014 The fundamental diffi culty in the solution of Division II is the fact that the iron is not self-determining. The highest percentage of iron in any group of the division is 98.720, and the lowest is 97.884, being a ratio of less than 101 to 100. It is true that the ratios in Divisions I and III are very little higher than this, but in both these cases there is a determining condition in the fact that there are a number of groups which are nearly pure iron, and it will evidently be less probable that a wrong result will be found under such circumstances. The only way, therefore, of obtaining an intelligent result for Division II is to make the iron self -determining, and since this can not be done within the limits of the division, it is necessary to combine it with Division I. This combination may be regarded as unjustifiable, since the effect of carbon decreases after a certain point is passed, but it can be answered that the curve in Figure XVIII gives no sign of falling, and that the value of carbon just found for Division II is greater than for Division I. Moreover, it will be shown in Table 123 that the value of carbon as found by the combi nation of I and II is higher than for I alone, so that there is good warrant for the union of the two. This conjunction will tend to prevent an absurd result in the case of iron, aud will give a better value for carbon ; but it will not prevent a wrong estimation of an element like copper, which has very little influence upon the tensile strength. It is certain that the equations of condition are"], [327, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 299 not absolutely accurate, owing to the limitations of chemical research and the variations in the rolled test-bars. These errors are incorporated into the normal equations, and are distributed in the final solution so as to give the best mathe matical result. It does not follow that the values so found will accurately represent the actual practical state of affairs, for a purely fanciful result is not an unusual phenomenon in mathematics ; thus, in the solution of every quadratic equation, two values are always produced by the plus and minus roots, and one of these values is often inapplicable to the original conditions. This occurred in the derivation of the curves given in Figure XVI, for there were two possible conic sections discovered in each case. One of them fitted the problem, while the other was a reverse curve exactly similar to the first, but situated for the most part in minus territory, and having an existence only as a mirage of the true solution. To prevent such a purely mathematical answer to the present practical problem it is necessary to discard two sets of variables : (1) Those which are known to have very little effect. (2) Those which are present in very nearly constant pro portion. If an element has no effect, then it can not be self-deter mining, but may be forced to bear all the results of analytical errors. If it is present in nearly constant quantity, then the slight variations can have very little determining effect. From one point of view these limitations beg the question, for it becomes necessary to know in a general way the influ ence of an element before its value can be quantitatively determined. The ultimate logical consequences of such a provision need not be discussed, for, in the problem under con sideration, it is known that copper has scarcely any influence upon the tensile strength, and that the same is true of sulphur when present in ordinary proportions. In the case of silicon there is a chance for greater hesita tion, but it will be noticed that in only eight groups is the content of this metalloid above .20 per cent., while in only three other groups, or 11 in all, is it over .03 per cent."], [328, "300 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. Within the limits of .00 and .03 per cent., which thus includes five-sixths of the groups, the power of silicon is not enough to disturb the calculation. Sec 158. \u2014 Effect of carbon, manganese, phosphorus, and iron upon the ultimate strength. \u2014 Having thus decided to neglect the effect of silicon, sulphur, and copper, the equa tions of condition are simplified so that they take the follow ing form : Equations of Condition.

In two cases the elimination has been performed in the order G, E, C, A, and has then been repeated \" back ward\" in the order A, C, E, G. The comparison of results shows the degree of accuracy obtained. In the other two cases the work was not repeated in this manner, but the table gives two values of iron. These two determinations are the result of substitution in the extreme equations, as shown by the chart on page 296, and the almost perfect agreement of the two proves that the work is correct within the limits of logarithmic error.

They are given also for Division II separately, in order to corroborate what was said in Sections 156 and 157 on the worthlessness of any solution of this division by itself. The value of 23236 pounds for the strength of pure iron is absurd, and, of course, this renders worthless all the other factors, but the coincidence of the results when the equations were worked in opposite directions proves conclusively the accuracy of the work. Moreover, I have applied these values to the separate groups of Division II, and the greatest discrepancy in any one group between the actual and the calculated strength is 6784 pounds, while the sum of the plus and minus errors is only 4.2 pounds, being an average error of only 0.28 pounds for each group.

This shows again, what has been insisted upon elsewhere, that perfectly correct mathematical results may be inapplicable to the practical conditions unless the factors are self-determining. The values found by the combination of Divisions I and II, and the values given for Division III, are those which have been applied to the groups in Table 121 under the titles of Formul\u00e6 No. 1 and No. 2. The antepenultimate column gives the tensile strength as calculated from the formula, while the penultimate shows the error, or the difference between this calculated value and the result found by the testing machine. The accuracy of the formul\u00e6 may be judged from the fact that the sum of the plus and minus quantities for the acid steels, comprising Divisions I and II, is 29 pounds, being an error of half a pound for each group. In the case of the basic steels the error is only five pounds, or only one-fifteenth of a pound for each group. Sec 159. \u2014 Value of carbon and phosphorus when manganese is neglected. \u2014 In the preceding section it has been shown that manganese is a plus quantity in basic steels, and a minus quantity in acid metal. These contradictory values may seem improbable, although they are by no means impossible. In order to get a little more light on the subject, I have arbitra rily divided the list of groups, given in Table 121, into two sets, and have determined the most probable values of carbon, manganese, and phosphorus, for each set. It would naturally be expected that the results from one-half the number of groups would be less valid and less uniform than from the complete list, but they may nevertheless be of use as corrobor ative evidence. The method of dividing the list was to take the odd num bers for one set and the even numbers for the other. Inas much as the original arrangement is on the basis of carbon content alone, it will be evident that this insures a fair division without any chance of selection in aid of any precon ceived theory. It would have been much better if a calculation could have been made on those groups showing low manganese, and those with high manganese, but as the low steels did not offer any examples of a high content of this element, and the high steels did not offer any examples of a low content, the result would have been of no value."], [331, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 303 In the case of the acid steel a mistake was made in taking for this arbitrary division the original list of groups, which, of course, was made up before the determinations of carbon were made by combustion. On comparing the numbers on this original list with the new arrangement, it was found that the two sets of so-called \" odd\" and \" even\" numbers really embraced the following groups, as given in Table 121, after they had been renumbered : Odd numbers : Groups 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 36, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45. Even numbers : Groups 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 28, 30, 32, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40, 46, and 47. Inasmuch as one arbitrary division seems to be as good as another, and as the calculation is very laborious, it was deemed unnecessary to repeat the work simply for the sake of uniformity, but this explanation is made for the sake of any mathematician who might wish to test the accuracy of the solution. In the case of the basic steel, the odd and even figures were taken as they stand in Table 121. The results are given in Table 124. Table 124. Values of Carbon, Manganese, Phosphorus, and Iron, obtained by Arbitrarily Dividing the List in Table 121 According to Odd and Even Numbers, and Solving Each Division by the Method of Least Squares. It will be seen that in each case the \" combined\" value, which is the original value given in Table 121, is very close to an average of the odd and even. This is by no means a_foj*e gone conclusion, and would not follow if the factors were not self -determining to a great extent. Value in pounds per sq. inch. Kind of steel. Factor. Odd. [ Even.

It will also be seen that there are variations in the values of each one of the factors, but that manganese shows the widest range. In the acid steel the figure for the even num bers is \u2014 107, while in the odd numbers it is only a small fraction. The variations in phosphorus are very small when compared with this, while those of carbon are insignificant. The value of iron must necessarily change with the other elements, since it is less self-determining than carbon or phos phorus. The great differences, found in the values of phosphorus in the odd and even subdivisions of the basic heats, are easily explained. An examination of the table will show that of the odd numbers there are only four groups showing more than .04 per cent, of phosphorus, and only three groups in the even numbers. There is therefore too little variation for the phos phorus to have an overpowering self-determining effect. The combined figures are subject to the same criticism, but the larger number of groups gives the results a greater validity. Taking into consideration the fact that manganese is indi cated as positive in basic and negative in acid steels, and that it gives wide differences in value between the odd and even lists, it would seem reasonable to suppose that it has very little effect at all when present in usual proportions, since the method of least squares should give a reliable result for an element which has a strong and positive action, when such an element is present in widely varying porportion. Accepting such a conclusion, it remains to be seen whether a true formula can be deduced by omitting manganese alto gether, and ascribing all the variations in tensile strength to the carbon, phosphorus, and iron.

Note. \u2014 All values are expressed in pounds per square inch. In order to see whether these formul\u00e6 satisfy all the classes of steels under consideration, the results in Table 126 may be analyzed by the following method : Silicon : Keferring to the acid steels in Table 121, it will be found that there are eight groups containing .22 per cent, or over of silicon. Four of these, 49, 55, 56, and 60, show an error in Table 126 of less than 2000 pounds. There are two groups, 52 and 54, having an aggregate plus error of 6390 pounds, and two groups, 57 and 61, with an aggregate minus error of 7080 pounds. Thus there is no evidence that silicon influences the result. Sulphur : There are six groups in the acid steels, 2, 10, 11, 17, 18, and 81, which contain .055 per cent, or more of sulphur, and none of these shows an error in Table 126 of over 2000 pounds. In the basic steels there are eight groups, 73, 77, 88, 91, 92, 98, 102, and 110, showing over .055 per cent., and the greatest error in any of them in Table 126 is 1680 pounds. Thus the sulphur does not seem to affect the situation. Manganese : There are sixteen acid groups containing .75 per cent, or more of manganese. Of these there are six, 36, 39, 40, 43, 45, and 53, which have an error in Table 126 of less than 2000 pounds, while group 48 is only 60 pounds above this figure. Of the remainder there are five groups, 44, 47, 50, 51, and 62, giving an aggregate plus error of 19310 pounds, and four groups, 34, 42, 58, and 59, with an aggregate minus error of 13720 pounds.

Of the remainder, four groups, 4, 19, 23, and 62, give an aggregate plus error of 12,330 pounds, and two groups, 58 and 59, give a minus error of 8220 pounds. This would indi cate that the value of phosphorus in the acid steels is nearly correct but that it may be a trifle too high. The basic metals contain no examples of high phosphorus, and hence the value found can not be corroborated. It will be found that these deductions must be materially modified on account of the investigations chronicled in Part III. In the later work the value of iron is nearly the same in acid and basic metal. This assuredly seems more in accord with reason, and gives greater force to the values found for the metalloids. The above calculation will be of interest to show how nearly an arbitrary equation can fit the case. Part III. EFFECT OF CARBON, MANGANESE, AND PHOSPHORUS UPON THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF IRON, AS DETERMINED BY SPECIAL MATHEMATICAL INVESTIGATIONS. Introductory Note. \u2014 A general synopsis of the argument and conclusions of both Parts II and III is given in Section 165. Sec 160. \u2014 Values of carbon, manganese, pihosphorus, and iron in a new series of acid steels. \u2014 In the introductory note to Part II of this chapter it was stated that a second series of steels had been investigated. The method employed in the formation of the groups was the same as described in Section"], [336, "308 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. 155, and all the details of the work were performed by the same men that conducted the previous examination. The two series, which we may call the \"old\" and the \"new,\" are therefore of equal force and virtue, and the testimony of one must always be considered in connection with the testimony of the other. It was proven in Section 157 that the influence of silicon in small proportions was so slight that it did not make a satis factory working factor for the method of least squares. The same was found true of sulphur and copper. In the plotting of the records of acid steel of the new series, however, it was found that the groups that contained high silicon seemed to show a greater tensile strength than steels of low silicon with the same content of carbon. As this was not the case in the old series, the groups were all put together in the former cal culation, but in the light of this new evidence it would seem proper to separate them on the basis of their silicon content. This is easily done, since in both cases the high-silicon heats were put together in separate groups. In the low-silicon groups neither the total content nor the variations in this element seem sufficient to materially disturb the result. The normal acid steels of the new series are shown in Division I of Table 128, and the normal acid steels of the old series in Division II. They are both combined to give the line AA in Figure XX. The high-silicon steels of the new series are given in Division III, and those of the old series in Division IV. They are both combined to give the line BB in Figure XX. The high-manganese and high-phosphorus steels of the .old series are placed in Division V, but are not shown in the diagram. Considering only the normal acid steels of both the old and the new series, as enumerated in Divisions I and II, a calcu lation was made by the method of least squares to find the values for carbon, manganese, phosphorus, and iron, which would most nearly satisfy the conditions of the problem. The results are shown in Table 127. In the old series as originally formed, including the abnormal steels, the value of .01 per cent, of manganese was \u2014 39 pounds. In the revised series, after omitting these groups, it"], [337, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 309 is \u2014 23 pounds, while in the new series the value deduced is -f- 3. It would appear, therefore, that manganese does not make a satisfactory working factor in the calculations on acid steels, while the values obtained for it, in addition to being contradictory, show that it does not have a very im- portant influence. In the following section, therefore, I have computed a formula from carbon, phosphorus, and iron alone, and have then compared the ultimate strengths as calculated from this formula with the actual tensile tests. Table 127. Values of Carbon, Manganese, Phosphorus, and Iron, as Determined by the Method of Least Squares from the Normal Acid Steels in Divisions I and II in Table 128. Sec 161. \u2014 Values of carbon, phosphorus, and iron in acid steel lohen manganese is neglected, as determined from the nor mal steels ofthe old and the new series combined. \u2014 Considering only the normal steels as given in Table 128, and omitting manganese from the problem, we shall have by the method of least squares the following equations, in which A == the influence of .001 per cent, of carbon, expressed in pounds per square inch, B = the influence of .001 per cent, of phosphorus, and C= the influence of .001 per cent, of iron.

There is never quite 100 per cent, of iron in any steel, so that it Avould not be right to take the above determination of iron as a starting point. Theoretically it would be necessary to calculate the value of iron for each separate metal, and this was done in Table 121 ; but for practical purposes it will be assumed that structural steel contairis 99.2 per cent, of iron, which by the above determination should confer a strength of 3S600 pounds per square inch for acid metal.

It then becomes practicable to write the following formula, by which the strength of acid steel may be calculated when the percentages of carbon and phosphorus are known, the answer being expressed in pounds per square inch. Acid Steel; 38600 + 121 Carbon + 89 Phosphorus + R \u2014 Ultimate Strength. The unit, for carbon and phosphorus is .001 per cent. The factor R represents an allowance for the conditions under which the piece is rolled, whether finished hot or cold. In the present series of groups it is zero."], [339, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 311 In Table 128 this formula has been applied to all the steels, both normal and abnormal, and the differences between the actual and the calculated ultimate strength have been placed in the last column. This difference will sometimes be spoken of as the \" error\" in subsequent remarks, as being the discrepancy between the recorded results and those obtained by calculation. An examination of this column reveals several notable points. First : Group 54 is entirely abnormal. It is almost identi cal in composition with Group 53, and yet differs from it by \u20224200 pounds in strength. The fact that No. 53 is an average of twelve heats and conforms to the formula, while No. 54 is an average of only four heats, points to the latter as an erratic member which has some bar-sinister in its history. Out of numerous possibilities it is only necessary to mention that one of the test-bars might have been wrongly marked. This group will be neglected in the following observations. Second : There is a decided difference between the old and the new series. The sum of all the plus values in Division I of Table 128, after omitting Group 54, is 49310 pounds, while the sum of the plus values in Division II is only 7290 pounds. The sum of the minus values in Division I is 10930 pounds, while in Division II it is 57780 pounds. The individual records cor roborate these totals, for in Division I there are 39 groups where the error is plus, and only 16 groups where it is minus. On the other hand, Division II furnishes only 11 groups where the error is plus, while it has 38 groups where it is minus. This seems too decided a record to be the result of chance, yet, as before stated, the two investigations relate to steels which were made in the same furnaces and handled by the same men, w-hile the physical and chemical determinations were made on the same apparatus and by the same operators. In the light of this evidence it is not remarkable that results from different sources are sometimes inconsistent. Third : There are seven groups among the normal acid steels where the actual strength is more than 2000 pounds beloio the calculated, and six of the seven, Nos. 29, 36, 45, 46, 49, and 50, show no striking peculiarity. The other group, No. 55, is low in phosphorus and sulphur, and rather high in manganese."], [340, "312 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. Table 128.

On the other hand, there are ten groups where the actual strength is more than 2000 pounds above the calculated, and six of these, Nos. 90, 94, 98, 101, 104, and 105, show a high content of manganese. Of the others, No. 1 is low in manga- nese and high in sulphur, No. 62 is high in phosphorus, No. 67 is normal, and No. 76 is low in sulphur. Thus the only- point that is gained by a review of those heats that display a difference of more than 2000 pounds between the calculated and actual strengths, is that high manganese seems to increase the tenacity. The figure 2000 pounds is chosen arbitrarily, since this seems a sufficiently close approximation to attain by any formula. Fourth : The influence of manganese may be investigated by putting together the groups that show a similar content of this element. Thus there are twenty-nine groups that hold from .30 to .39 per cent. Nineteen of these have a plus error with a total of 21650 pounds, while ten groups have a minus error with a total of 8030 pounds. The difference between these totals, or rather their algebraic sum, is -f- 13620, which, divided by twenty-nine, gives the average error for one group. ilvision III.

Table 129. Average Error of Groups in Table 128 Arranged According to their Manganese Content. It should be noted that most of the groups that contain high manganese are in Division II, and it has been remarked that there is some occult cause why the actual strengths of this division are slightly above the formula. The error arising from this condition is not sufficient to invalidate the records, but when most of the members of the division are slightly above the formula it is not extraordinary if the high-manga nese groups follow the rule. Passing over this reasoning, the table teaches that in steels containing about .25 per cent, of manganese, the actual ulti mate strength is 893 pounds greater than would be indicated by the formula. \"With an increase in the content to .36 per cent, the actual strength is 470 pounds less than the formula, and with .-41 per cent, it is 416 pounds less. From this point an increase in manganese gives an increase in strength. It is important to notice that the figures -j- 446 for .44 per cent, of manganese, and -f- 470 for .36 per cent., are consistent with the minus values for the higher percentages, since man ganese was entirely omitted in the derivation of the formula, and the result may therefore be looked upon as strictly appli cable only to the average content of an element which it neglects ; and if such an element does have an effect, it should make itself evident in a plus error on one side of the average and a minus error on the other.

This inconsistency is explained by the values obtained in the first three lines of Table l-'!>. With a content of .27 per cent., the actual strength is more than the calcu lated, and this is directly opposed to the law of higher strength with higher manganese. Moreover, the figure for .36 per cent. is practically the same as that for .44 per cent., being -f- 470 in one case and -4-446 in the other. Considering the fact that three-quarters of all the groups were below .50 per cent, in man ganese, and that the results on such metal were indecisive, it is not strange that manganese did not form a proper determina tive member of the equations. It is indicated, therefore, that with less than .50 per cent, of manganese the effect is not so uniformly marked as with larger proportions. Whether this is due to a different physical or molecular condition of soft metal, or to the presence of oxide of iron, or whether it arises from abnormality of the steels, or determinative errors in the records, can not be satis factorily demonstrated. The results, as a whole, justify the use of a formula for normal acid steels without any factor representing manga nese. With contents above .60 per cent, of this element, it is necessary to make allowance for an increased strength, while above .80 per cent, the tenacity will rapidly increase. It may also be necessary to allow for a very low content of manganese, since it was found in Table 129 that when there is less than .30 per cent, the actual strength was 893 pounds more than was indicated by the formula. This fact will be considered in Section 164 in connection with other informa tion from the basic steels. Fiftli : The high-silicon steels all show a much greater strength than is given by the formula. The natural inference would be that silicon strengthens steel, but it is necessary to notice a curious and important fact, viz., that the differences between the calculated and actual strength vary in propor tion to the content of carbon, and not in proportion to the content of silicon. In the new series, as given in Division III, the lowest carbon is .253 per cent., and the error is 1560 pounds. As the carbon increases to .316 per cent., the error rises to 2470"], [345, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 317 pounds, and with .342 per cent, it is 5300 pounds. The old series starts at .333 per cent, as the lowest carbon, and the error is 4870 pounds, so that the two series agree perfectly at the starting point. They also agree at their highest point, for the maximum carbon is .535 per cent, in the new series, and .554 in the old, the error being 14580 pounds in one case and 14470 in the other. Between these two extremes there are considerable variations, but in the main the law holds good that the error steadily rises with higher carbon. A glance at the table will show that the content of silicon is practically constant throughout both series, and hence it is mathematically impossible to find any constant value for this element which will account for the variations in ultimate strength. In explanation of this it may be urged that the formula by which the strength is calculated gives a wrong value to carbon. The answer to this criticism will be found in the line CC in Figure XX. The most casual inspection will show that this line is very* nearly parallel to the trend of the line AA. It is impossible to decide exactly what that trend is, but the line CC seems to follow the average direction as near as it can be estimated. If any criticism were to be made, it would be that the tangent of CC was too great rather than too small. Bearing in mind that the carbon determines the tangent of these lines, and that the linear distance between them repre sents the effect of the other metalloids, it will be seen that the graphic delineation bears almost conclusive proof of the mathematical deductions. The general trend of the line BB in Figure XX, which repre sents the high-silicon steels, forms a decidedly greater tangent to the horizontal axis than the line AA or its counterpart CC, and it would be impossible to draw a line which would be parallel to the trend of BB, and which at the same time would be parallel to the trend of CC, and since it has been remarked that the tangent of CC is fully as great as it can be to fall parallel to AA, and is possibly a step beyond, it will be evident that a different law is indicated for the metals with high silicon. This law may be stated in two different ways :"], [346, "318 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. First : That a constant percentage of silicon exerts a greater effect with each increment of carbon. Second : That when a constant percentage of silicon is present, each increment of carbon exerts a greater influence. It will be granted that this law has an upper limit, since the ultimate strength does not increase after a certain content of carbon is attained. It also appears that there is a lower limit, for, by referring again to Figure XX, it will be seen that the line BB joins AA at a point corresponding to about .25 per cent, of carbon, and it is therefore indicated that silicon has very little effect below this point, even when present in considerable proportions. These high-silicon groups were all composed of heats made for steel castings, and it seems possible that the different conditions of casting temperature might exert an influence on the result. If this were true, it would also seem as if soft steel, made for castings, should show different physical properties from heats made in the ordinary way. Such does not seem to be. the case, for Groups 9, 16, 20, 23, 85, 86, 89, 91, 92, 93, and 99, were composed almost entirely of casting heats, and yet conform very closely to the formula. Sixth : The influence of sulphur has not been taken into account in the formula, and accordingly* an investigation was made on the steels of Divisions I and II of Table 128 by the same process of synthetical differentiation that was used to discover the effect of manganese in Table 129, Group No. 54 being omitted as before.

The groups were formed in the same way* as described in Section 155, and a list of them is given in Division I of Table 131, while the old series of basic steels is shown in Division II. The numbers given to the groups are continuous with those in Table 128 to avoid confusion in references. The members of both series are combined to give Curve AA in Figure XXI.

In the case of acid steel this process gave a satisfactory' formula, but in the basic steel it gave the following results : .01 per cent, of carbon = + 998 pounds. .ol pi-r cent, of phosphorus= + 1444 pounds. Pure iron = 39987 pounds. This value of phosphorus is not sustained by any other evidence. Referring to Table 130, it will be seen that the corresponding figure was -4- 939 for the new series, and -f- 941 for the old series. Thinking that there might be a clerical error, the solution was repeated in reverse order, as described on page 296, but the answers were found to be mathemati cally correct to five places. This high value of phosphorus, when manganese is omitted, may be explained in the following way : (1) It has been shown that carbon is self-determining in every series investigated, and that it gives fairly accurate results. (2) The iron is less self-determining, but with basic metal, where some groups are so nearly pure iron, the chance for variations in this factor is less than in the case of acid steel. (3) It is evident, therefore, that if manganese is a positive factor, and if it is neglected, its effect must be forced upon some other factor by the method of least squares, and phos phorus is the only factor available. (4) The responsibility falls on phosphorus rather than on carbon, because the variations in phosphorus are very small, and it is therefore less self-determining than carbon, and less than in acid steel where it is present in large proportions.

Following the same line of argument as in acid steels, it is necessary to make allowance for the fact that there is never 100 per cent, of iron in any steel. The figure 99.2 per ceut. was taken as a basis in Section 101, and it will also be taken in the present case. It is true that the phosphorus is generally lower in basic steel, but, on the other hand, the carbon is usually higher. On this assumption the strength given by the iron itself in an average basic steel will be 37430 pounds per square inch. Fig. XXI.

The factor R represents an allowance for the conditions under which the piece is rolled, whether finished hot or cold. In the present series of groups it is zero. In each case the unit is .001 per cent., but since manganese is seldom deter-"], [353, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 325 mined beyond two decimal points, it will be convenient in calculation to use a unit of .01 per cent, and a value of 85 pounds per unit, but it would be very confusing to so write the formula. In Table 131 this formula has been applied to the basic steels of the old and the new series, and the differences between the actual and the calculated ultimate strengths have been placed in the last column. An inspection of these differences, or \" errors,\" as they have been called, brings to light one or two points of interest. First : The difference, which was found between the two series of normal acid steels, exists also between the two series of basic products. In Division I there are fifty-six groups that give a plus error, with a total of 57,130 pounds, while there are only fourteen groups that are minus, with a total of 18,080 pounds. On the other hand, Division II offers only 24 groups having a plus error, with a total of 18.330 pounds, while it has 51 groups with a total minus error of 65,350 pounds. The net error of Division I is -j- 39,050 pounds, and that of Division II is \u2014 47,020 pounds. * The reason for this difference is unknown. Second : An investigation was made into the effect of man ganese in the same way as was done for acid steel in Table 129, and the results are shown in Table 132. Table 132. Average Error of Groups in Table 131, Arranged According to their Manganese Content. There is no such regular progression as was shown in the former case.

' In the case of the steels containing between .20 and .i\".l per cent, manganese, the actual strength is 1473 pounds above the calculated. This will be again referred to in Section 164. Third: The influence of sulphur was investigated in the same way as manganese. The results, given herewith, agree with those found from acid steel, in showing that sulphur exerts no regular influence upon the tensile strength. 13 groups bet. .01 and .02 per cent, sulphur gave an av. error of + 317 lbs. 37 \" \" .02 \" .03 \" \" \" \" \" \u2014 59K \" 69 \" \" .03 \" .04 \" \" \" \" \" + 251 \" 9 \" \" .04 \" .05 \" \" \" \" \" \u2014397 \" 12 \" \" .05 \" .i\u00bbl \" \" \" \" \" + 81 \" 4 \" \" .06 \" .07 \" \" \" \" \" - 855 \" 2 \" \" .ox \" .09 \" \" \" \" \" \u2014645 \" Fourth : A similar table, which is here given, shows the average error for the different percentages of phosphorus. This is done as corroborative evidence that the value of phos phorus in the formula is correct, for it may be assumed that if the value was too high or too low, the fact would be made manifest by a large error in the groups containing either high or low phosphorus. The fact that no regular relation exists seems to indicate that the deduced value is practically correct. 21 groups bet. .oo and .01 per cent, phosphorus gave an av. error of \u2014 20 lbs. 63 \" .01 \" .02 \" \" \" \" \" \u2014 56 \" 39 \" .02 \" .03 \" \" \" \" \" \u2014 168 \" 13 \" .03 \" .04 \" \" \" \" \" + 261 \" 7 \" M \" .05 \" \" \" \" \" \u20142:14 \" 3 \" .05 \" .06 \" \" '' \" \" + 263 \" Sec 164. \u2014 Meaning of the term \"pure iron.\" \u2014 In the fore going investigation, a slightly different value was found for \" pure iron\" as derived from acid steels, and \" pure iron\" as derived from basic metal. This contradiction is solely a matter of words. Absolutely pure iron never has been, and, in all probability, never will be made. The steels given in Table 120 are about as near to pure iron as can be found. Heat No. 4932 in that table contains .011 per cent, of phosphorus, .04 per cent, of manganese, .029 per cent, of sulphur, and .04 per cent, of copper. The carbon was not determined by combus tion, but it must have been about the same as the average"], [355, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 327 sample of the six heats, which was .025 per cent. This would leave a total content of impurities of 00.145 per cent. If copper is omitted from the total, as having no appreciable effect, the total will be 00.105 per cent. Notwithstanding this purity, the tensile strength of this heat is 46480 pounds, which is practically the same as the average of the group. The great strength of this metal, as compared with a steel containing a larger proportion of im purity, has already been discussed in Section 153, but must again be considered here. It is easy to imagine that oxide of iron is present in this decarburized and dephosphorized product, and that it may confer an abnormal cohesive power. This supposition is corroborated by Tables 129 and 132, which indicate that both acid and basic steels, when low in manganese, are somewhat stronger than would be accounted for by their content of carbon and phosphorus, and it will be acknowledged that such steel holds a considerable quantity of oxygen. It is true that these abnormal metals may contain unusual proportions of certain substances like hydrogen, nitrogen, or carbonic oxide, but since the effect of these constituents is entirely hypothetical, the most reasonable hypothesis is that oxide of iron increases the ultimate strength. Whether this theory is perfectly true or not is of little im portance so far as the present investigation is concerned, for the results obtained from absolutely pure iron would be utterly valueless as a guide in creating a proper formula. From one point of view* there is no more real necessity of knowing the strength of pure iron than of knowing the strength of pure carbon or pure phosphorus. There may be no connection at all between the tensile strength of a carbide or phosphide of iron and the tensile strength of its separate components, since a chemical compound often has nothing in common with its parents. In the foregoing pages, therefore, the term \" pure iron\" is arbitrary, and is intended to express simply the datum plane from which it is most convenient to start in order to find the strength of steel by a simple formula. Sec. 165. \u2014 Synopsis of the argument and conclusions in the foregoing investigations. \u2014 The argument involved in the fore-"], [356, "328 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. going calculations is so complicated, and the conclusions are so scattered throughout the text, that it will be convenient to give a general synopsis of Parts II and III of this chapter. As far as the conclusions are concerned, it is conceded that no one series of experiments can make a valid foundation for universal generalizations, but it has been deemed proper to put the discovered relations into the form of statements, which are to be accepted subject to the limitations of the premises. Basis of the investigation. \u2014 The object of the investigation was to discover the influence upon the tensile strength of open-hearth steel, of the metalloids that are usually found therein. Both acid and basic metals were investigated, but the two kinds were kept separate throughout the work. The preliminary tests of several hundred heats of each kind of steel were at hand, with a record of the ultimate strength of each, together with the content of sulphur, phos phorus, and manganese. These tests were made into several divisions on the basis of their ultimate strength, and these divisions were again subdivided so as to produce groups that would show high and low phosphorus, high and low sulphur, and high and low manganese. These groups were analyzed by taking an equal quantity of drillings from each bar, and determining the carbon by combustion, and also the silicon and the copper. The iron was calculated by difference. Each one of these groups was then considered as a unit, and an equation was constructed from its chemical composition. On one side of the equation were the carbon, silicon, manganese, sulphur, phosphorus, copper and iron, and on the other side was the ultimate strength. The coefficients of the factors were the percentages found by analysis, while the factors themselves were the unknown quantities whose values were to be sought. Mathematical calculations. \u2014 The only method which seemed to meet the case was the method of least squares, but the first application of this very complicated and laborious mathematical agent gave results which were palpably incorrect. It was demonstrated that the error arose from using silicon, sulphur, and copper as factors in the equations, when, as a matter of fact, they exerted no controlling influence."], [357, "329 INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. Neglecting these elements, a solution was made by which values were found for carbon, manganese, phosphorus, and iron. Differences existed between the basic and acid steels in the values of all these factors, but the most striking variation was in manganese, it being found that it was a minus quantity in acid, and a plus quantity in basic steel. After completing these calculations, the same line of work was repeated on an entirely new series of acid and basic steels. The results corroborated the former records in most respects, but the value of manganese was found to be very nearly zero in the case of the acid steel. Certain computations showed that this element gave very discordant results when the acid steels were separated into two arbitrary divisions, while the figures for the other metalloids preserved their general char acter, and the conclusions were drawn that manganese was an unsatisfactory factor in acid metal, that its effect upon the tensile strength was very small when present in ordinary proportions, and that a working formula could be constructed without it. Finally the old and the new series of steels were put together and a solution was made of the combined list to find the most probable values of the metalloids. Manganese was neglected in the case of the acid steel, but it was found to have a decided influence upon basic metal. From the values so determined, formul\u00e6 were constructed, and these were applied in Tables 128 and 131 to the groups from which they were derived. Against each group is placed the strength as given by the formula, as well as the difference between this figure and the actual strength. This column of differences was then analyzed in the case of both acid and basic steels, and it was sought to find whether there was any law of error ; for instance, whether high-sulphur groups would always give a plus difference and low-sulphur groups a minus difference, thus indicating that the formula did not fit the facts, and that the values were not correct. From this series of steps the following conclusions were drawn : Conclusions. \u2014 (1) The strength of pure iron, as far as it can be determined from the strength of steel, is about 38,000 or 39,000 pounds per square inch."], [358, "330 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. (2) An increase of .01 per cent, of carbon raises the tensile strength of acid steel about 1210 pounds per square inch, and of basic steel about 950 pounds. This difference between the effect of carbon upon acid and basic steels, as found by mathematical analysis, is corroborated by the graphic records in Figures XX and XXI. (3) An increase of .01 per cent, of manganese has very little effect upon acid steel unless the content exceeds .60 per cent., but it raises the strength of basic steel about 85 pounds per square inch. (4) An increase of .01 per cent, of phosphorus raises the tensile strength of acid steel about 890 pounds per square inch, and of basic steel about 1050 pounds. (5) The following formul\u00e6 will give the ultimate strength of ordinary open-hearth steel in pounds per square inch, the carbon, manganese, and phosphorus being expressed iu units of .001 per cent., and a value being assigned to B in accord ance with the conditions of rolling and the thickness of the piece.

(6) The metals, from which these data were derived, were ordinary structural steels ranging from .02 to .35 per cent, of carbon, and it is not expected that the formul\u00e6 are applicable to higher steels or to special alloys. (7) A considerable difference may be found between steels which apparently are of the same composition, and which, as far as known, have been made under the same conditions. (8) In the case of acid steel, an increase in manganese above .60 per cent, will raise the tensile strength above the amount indicated by the formula, the increment being quite marked when a content of .80 per cent, is exceeded. (9) In steels containing from .30 to .50 per cent, of carbon, the value of the metalloids is fully as great as with lower steels, while the presence of silicon in such metal in propor tions greater than .15 per cent, seems to enhance the strength ening effect of carbon."], [359, "INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS ON STEEL. 331 (10) Iii steels containing less than .25 per cent, of carbon the effect of small proportions of silicon upon the ultimate strength is inappreciable.

(12) Both acid and basic steels containing less than .30 per cent, of manganese give an actual strength greater than is shown by the formula, and when this is taken in connection with the abnormal strength of the unusually pure metal shown in Group 198 of Table 131, it is indicated that oxide of iron raises the ultimate strength."], [360, "332 CHAPTER XVIII. CLASSIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL STEELS. Section 166. \u2014 Influence of the method of manufacture on the properties of steel. \u2014 The first problem in the writing of specifications for structural steel is the advisability of pre scribing the method by which it shall be manufactured. Some engineers, with commendable fairness, hold that the way in which a bar or plate is made is a matter entirely beyond their dominion. Logically this position is impregnable, but it is not so practically, for although there is no essential difference in the results obtained from open-hearth and Bessemer steel in the ordinary testing machine, there is good testimony to show that the product of the converter is an inferior metal which gives way in a treacherous manner under shock. It is granted that in a strict sense there is no such thing as treachery or mystery, but these are convenient terms to cover an undiscovered law. The evidence concerning the unrelia bility of Bessemer steel is made up for the most part of scattered individual opinions, many of which have been made on insufficient evidence, but they are too numerous to be entirely ignored, and they are fortified by the carefully con sidered statements of men whose words are weighed, and who are absolutely disinterested in their decisions. Thus A. E. Hunt, whose long experience as the chief of The Pittsburg Testing Laboratory gives much force to his opinion, writes as follows :* \" Numerous cases have come under our observation of angles and plates which broke off short in punching, but although makers of Bessemer steel claim that this is just as * The Inspection of Materials of Construction in the United States. Journal I. and B. I., Vol. II, 1890, p. 816."], [361, "CLASSIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL STEELS. 333 likely to occur in open-hearth metal, we have as yet never seen an instance of failure of this kind in open-hearth steel.\" Mr. Hunt also quotes ( lo c. cit.) from a paper by Wailes before the British Association to the effect that \" these mysterious failures occur in steel of one class, viz., soft steel made by the Bessemer process.\" There is also the testimony of W. H. White, Director of Naval Construction, Royal Navy.* \" With converter steel, riveted samples have given less average strength, greater variations in strength, and much more irregularity in modes of fracture than similar samples of open-hearth steel. The basic open-hearth metal has proven to be as good as that made on the acid hearth, and, after full investigation, it will be used by the Admiralty in ship plates and boiler tubes on an equal footing.\" My own experience leads me to think that Bessemer steel requires more work for the attainment of a proper structure than open-hearth metal, so that a thick bar is more apt to have a coarse crystalline fracture. This may be ascribed in any particular case to improper heat treatment, but if it is true that open-hearth metal would not be injured under a similar exposure, then it is proven that there is a difference between the metals, and, if this be acknowledged, then there is no necessity for further argument. It is true that Bessemer metal has been used for rails, and that these are exposed to great stress and shock, but it is also true that a large number of rails break in service, and that the use of ordinary rail steel for bridges was long ago given up as dangerous. Moreover, it is quite probable that the number of broken rails would be considerably reduced if they were made of open-hearth steel. It is acknowledged that the case is not yet closed, but until the foregoing statements are controverted by direct and positive evidence, the only safe way for the engineer is to prescribe that only open-hearth metal shall be used in all structures, like railroad bridges, where the metal is under constant shock, and where life and death are in the balance. In this connection it should be stated that the method by * Experiments with Basic Steels. Journal I. and S. I., Vol. I, 1892, p. 85."], [362, "334 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. which the steel is made can not be discovered by ordinary chemical analysis. Certain experiments indicate that there is a difference between Bessemer and open-heart h steel in the character of the occluded gases, but this system of analysis is never resorted to in practice, and no provision is made for it in laboratories. Moreover, it is doubtful if any expert would risk his reputation by asserting positively, from any such evidence, that a certain steel was made by either one or the other process. Consequently, when open-hearth metal is specified, a careful watch should be kept in the steel works that there is no substitution of the inferior material. Sec 167. \u2014 Chemical specifications. \u2014 Another point concern ing which there is room for discussion is the propriety of limiting the chemical composition. Some engineers contend that as long as the physical tests are fulfilled, the making of the metal is an entirely foreign matter. This position is untenable, for it would be possible to make a steel with 0.25 per cent, of phosphorus which would satisfy the ordinary tests of strength and ductility, and although such a content could usually be detected in the shops, a considerable propor tion of the bars might be able to pass muster. It is impossible to fix a limit of phosphorus below which there is no danger of treacherous breakage, but it is quite certain that, as the content is reduced, the danger of such disaster disappears. On this account it becomes not only the province but the duty of the engineer to specify the chemical composition of the metal that he buys. In the construction of ordinary roof-trusses and similar work there is no necessity for stringency, and Bessemer steel with a maximum content of .10 per cent, of phosphorus may be allow*ed; but in railroad bridges, travelling cranes, and other structures where the steel is exposed to moving loads and continued shock, and where the consequence of failure may not be measured in money, the specifications should require the use of open-hearth steel with a maximum phosphorus of .06 per cent. The common limit at the present day is .08 per cent., but the time has come for another step in advance, since the difference in the cost of the purer metal has been reduced to an unimportant figure. In addition to thus limiting the chemical content of phos-"], [363, "CLASSIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL STEELS. 335 phorus, it is necessary to specify the manner in which the sample shall be taken for analysis. There are four methods of doing this of which only one is correct, and this correct one is seldom or never used. Taking for illustration a rolled billet of steel three inches square, its cross-section may be mentally divided into nine equal squares, each having an area of one square inch. Eight of these squares are next to the surface, while only one is in the interior. This central square w*ill include almost all the segregated portion of the mass. Ordinarily a sample of such a billet would be taken by drilling to a depth of half an inch, but it is evident that this does not take cognizance of the interior core, and that the chemical determinations on the drillings wrill show too low a content of certain segregating metalloids. Another method is to drill all the way to the center, and to take all the drillings that are made. Two-thirds of these drillings will come from the outside square and one-third from the inside, or a ratio of two from the outside and one from the interior, while the true ratio is eight to one ; hence the content of segregating metalloids found by this method is higher than the true average. A third method which is sometimes used, although mani festly inaccurate, is to take only those drillings that come from the central portion, but this will give a very much higher content of certain elements than will be found through out the bar. The fourth way is to plane the entire surface and thus get a true average, but, as before stated, this practice is seldom carried out. In the case of angles, a very fair sample can be obtained by drilling into the bar as far as the center, the results so obtained being only slightly higher than the true values. In plates it is much more difficult to take a fair sample, since the segregated portion is in the body of the sheet, and it is usually impracticable to drill a hole without injuring the strength of the member. It is easy to see that great injustice may be done by insist ing on unusual methods of sampling. It would be perfectly right to state in the contract that drillings were to be taken"], [364, "336 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. from the center of the plate, but it is not right to take them in this way in the absence of a previous understanding. On the other hand, the engineer has an indisputable right to invest] gate the homogeneity of any plate, and to reject those members that show excessive segregation. It is necessary, therefore, to take some account of these variations, and in the following specification it is provided that when drillings are taken from the center of plates, tin* allowable maximum of phosphorus and sulphur shall be rai8eil 25 per cent. ; e. //., from .04 to .05 per cent., or .08 to .10 per cent. The engineer who has been calling for steel containing less than .08 per cent, of phosphorus, may deem it a step backward to allow the center of plates to contain .10 per cent., but it is necessary to consider that the new provision is merely a formal recognition of a fact, and that the higher phosphorus has always existed in the center of plates, particularly if they have been rolled directly from ordinary plate ingots which have not undergone a preliminary \"roughing\" and \"cropping.\" It is also well to consider that less careful engineers, who have specified a maximum of .10 per cent, of phosphorus, have received many a plate that contained .12 per cent., and even .15 per cent., of this impurity. The fact of non-homoge neity in plates is a strong argument in favor of the further lowering of the allowable maximum, for, when all other con ditions are the same, each decrease in the average content diminishes the increment due to segregation. Some engineers may wish to sjiecify that basic metal shall show a still lower phosphorus. There does not seem to be any proof that basic open-hearth steel of a given composition is more unreliable than acid metal of the same character, but in order to meet any possible danger, and because the cost of a little extra purification is not excessive, it is not amiss to require that the best basic steel shall not show over .04 per cent, of phosphorus. The other elements need not be rigidly limited, for many combinations are possible, and some discretion should be left to the maker in the attainment of definite results. It is not uncommon for engineers of limited knowledge to write specifi cations that give an upper limit for every element, and"], [365, "CLASSIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL STEELS. 337 require a tensile strength which can not be obtained by the formula. The carbon should always be left open, so that if the maker wishes to reduce the phosphorus he may use carbon to get strength. Manganese may be limited to .60 per cent, on the steels under 64000 pounds per square inch, and to .80 per cent, on harder metal. This will ensure a safe material, and will not be a burden on the manufacturer. Silicon is of little importance, but the maximum may be placed at .04 per cent, for soft steel, this proportion being seldom, if ever, exceeded. Sulphur, in most cases, concerns the manufacturer more than the engineer, for if it is too high the bar will crack in rolling and be imperfect, while it seems to have no marked effect on the ductility of the finished piece. In material for eye-bars, however, there is danger that high sulphur may cause coarse crystallization during the heating necessary to form the eye. Copper may be entirely neglected, for no ill effect upon the cold properties of low steel has ever been traced to its action, while thousands of tons of excellent metal have been made with a content of . 75 per cent. Rivet steel, like eye-bar flats, stands on an entirely different footing from other structural metal, for this must be heated and worked after leaving the manufactory. Only the very best of material should be used, and it should be so soft that it will not be injured by cold working or crystallized by over heating. The phosphorus should not be over .04 per cent., the sulphur not over .05 per cent., and the tensile strength not over 56000 pounds per square inch. These limits should be insisted upon whether acid or basic open-hearth metal be used. Sec 168. \u2014 Use of soft steel in structural work. \u2014 It is not the intention of this chapter to arbitrarily state just what should or should not be given as the best tensile strength for every purpose, but it is my opinion that a softer metal should be used for bridges than is often employed, because, although a slight sacrifice is made in the ultimate strength, there is a gain in the working strength due to the higher elastic ratio, and a decided increase in toughness and resistance to shock, so that the calculations may be made on the same basis for the working load as with a harder metal."], [366, "338 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. The fact that the elastic ratio rises as the ultimate strength decreases is not generally recognized, but will be shown in Table 133. This is constructed by comparing the groups of angles in Table 69, which are made by the same process, and are of the same thickness, and which contain the same per centage of phosphorus. It will be found that in every case the stronger steel gives a lower elastic ratio. Table 133. Kise in Elastic Ratio with Decrease in Ultimate Strength. Comparison of the Angles Given in Table 69 which are Made by the Same Process, of the Same Thickness, and with the Same Content of Phosphorus. The tendency in the first epoch of steel structures was toward a hard alloy, but the later practice has been a con tinual progress toward toughness. There was a halt in this movement at a tensile strength of 60,000 pounds, not entirely on account of any magic virtue in the figure, but because the ordinary mild steels gave that result, and a much higher price was charged for a softer metal. The conditions to-day are somewhat different, for the reduced cost of low-phosphorus pig-iron, and the introduction of the basic hearth, have altered the economic situation. A steel with a tensile strength of 50,000 to 58,000 pounds per square inch is a most attractive material, possessing all Z a, \u2022 \u00a3 \"a . \u00a7s \u00a7 -h* - fe w S aa c . *s - . , BQ /j Z Zl 12 - i- - c o I \u00a71 I* _J <Jr_ y_ A to 3 lasic O.

AYith this recommendation for the adoption of softer metal, certain classes are proposed from which the engineer can choose. In some cases the option is given between acid and basic open-hearth steel, but it must not be forgotten that it costs more to make low-phosphorus metal by the acid than by the basic process, so that the terms of the specifica tion should be enforced after the contract is awarded, out of justice to the other bidders who have based their calculations on the letter of the law. In steel above .08 per cent, of phosphorus, this difference in cost disappears and there is no economy in the use of the basic hearth. The option is sometimes given between open-hearth and Bessemer metal, but it will be understood that whenever the former is specified the latter is not admissible, although as a matter of course the manufacturer may supply open-hearth in place of Bessemer, if for any reason he wishes to use the better and more expensive material. Sec. 169. \u2014 Tests on jylates. \u2014 In the specifications for plates it will be noticed that a variation of 10,000 pounds per square inch is allowed, and that concessions are made for thick and wide sections. All this may seem to some engineers to be a step backward, but in reality these provisions have been in force for many years. The engineer who writes a new specification calling for a better elongation, never knows that he receives exactly the same steel that has been made before. The plate rollers have been driven to expedients which are not dis honest, but which are dangerously near the line of deception. Thus, if it is required that a test must be cut from one plate out of every ten, the manufacturer will leave a coupon on every plate and test strips which are cut from immediately next to them ; after finding which plates fill the requirements, the coupons are cut from the others and the inspector is told that the pile is ready for him. If every plate is to be tested, then a coupon is left upon each corner and a contiguous strip is privately tested by the maker. After finding which corner gives the. best results, the other coupons are cut off and the plate submitted to the"], [368, "340 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. inspector. This is not dishonest, for any one corner repre sents the plate just as much as any other corner, and it would manifestly be absurd to designate from which corner the test, is to be taken. It is also quite certain that no one corner represents the center of the plate, for the edges are always finished colder than the center, and it is just as certain that in a plate rolled direct from an ingot with only the usual amount of scrap, the corners in no way represent the part of the plate which corresponds to the segregated portion of the ingot. It is by care in the preliminary testing rather than by im provement in the quality of material that advances have been made, and it is time that the fact be made known to engi neers. The mill managers have been aided by the inspectors for most of these men (to their credit be it said) are anxious to pass material which they know to be good. They allow the manufacturer to put part of a heat into thick plates and part into thin, and make the tests on the three-eighths or one-half inch gauges ; they pass over the sheets that are 100 inches wide, and cut the coupons from plates that are less than 70 inches. These concessions have been tacitly made in the past ; I have merely put them into print. On the other hand, I have called for higher tests on plates under 42 inches wide. This is because they can be made on a universal mill, and since better results can be had in this way, it is right to demand what there is a perfectly simple way of obtaining. It will be seen that no allowance is made for a variation in tensile strength for different shapes, while concessions are made for differences in thickness. This inconsistency arises from the fact that it is generally known beforehand whether a certain heat of steel is to be rolled into angles, or plates, or eye-bars, and it is seldom that it is necessary to put part of a heat into one shape and part into another. On the other hand, it is almost always necessary to roll a charge into more than one thickness and more than one size of angles, plates, etc., and it is evidently an onerous restriction if proper allow ance be not made for the normal variations due to different thickness. Sec. 170. \u2014 Standard size of test-pieces.\u2014 -In all the tensile tests"], [369, "341 classification of structural steels. a length of eight inches is taken as the standard for all sections, allowance being made for variations in shape and size. It should be noted that this may soon be an obsolete method. Within the last few years there have been conferences held in foreign lands to establish uniform methods of testing, and it has been officially recommended that in the case of rounds the length of the test-piece shall be proportional to the square root of the sectional area. In Appendix V to the Report of the Committee on Standard Tests of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, published in 1893, the formula is given I = 12.0 ./\"/\"\"when I = the length in inches and f = the sectional area in square inches. In Table 134 I have calcu lated from this formula the proper length for rounds from one-half inch to 1\\ inches in diameter. It will be seen that the length is greatly reduced as the diameter grows less, and this, of course, is equivalent to demanding less elongation, while on larger sizes the length is increased, this being the same thing as demanding more elongation. Table 134. Calculation of 12.0 JT~ for Different Diameters, together with the Proportional Elongation for the Given Lengths as Determined by Curve AA in Figure XV. It is rather difficult to compare this system, in which the elongation is constant and the length varies, with the system wherein the length is constant and the required elon gation varies ; but an attempt is made to do this by obtaining the proportional elongation for the different lengths from Curve AA in ligure NV. The results are given in the last column of tne table, and it will be found that the allowances for _S\u00a3~^\u00ab^ Diameter, in inchei \u25a0r Sg 52 i- fe^ic /i or stl*0{l in square inches. r\u2014 O -t- CC -1 ~1 CC \u00a9 '3 X -a, Oi CJi *- <~_ WHOtf-^iaoi co cc pa w fe \"~ ic 12.0 V / = length In inches of test- piece.

I have not accepted the recommendations of the conference because the matter is in the hands of a committee of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and until this committee has made its final report, and until this has been officially accepted by the Engineering Societies of America, it would seem forward to attempt the inauguration of an entirely new system. A long time has been spent in arriving at the general adoption of an international standard length of eight inches, and it seems unfortunate from one point of view that a ((implicated change is to be proposed. If, how ever, such a revolution is consummated, it will be found that the system herein presented will not need to be destroyed but only translated. It is understood in these specifications, as well as through out this book, that the elastic limit is determined by the drop of the beam, for this is the universal method in American steel works and rolling mills. I have no sympathy with that group of agitators who are trying to introduce new mean ings to old terms, and to apply old terms to new factors. It matters not whether the drop of the beam does or does not mark the spot where the elongation ceases to be exactly pro portionate to the load. It is certain that it represents a critical point of failure, and this is acknowledged by the agitators before mentioned, who recommend its determination on all tensile test-pieces. Moreover, it is shown in Section 141 that this is a definite point which can be determined more accurately than the reduction of area, and nearly as accurately as the elongation. If a new point is desired, such as is shown by an autographic device, then this new point should be given a new name. The term \" elastic limit\" has been preempted by general use, as part of a system of trade nomenclature, to designate the point where the beam drops. Upon this determination all specifications and contracts are based, and any attempt to ascertain the elastic limit in any other way is a change in the contract requirements which would not be sustained in a court of equity. All calculations upon factors of safety in existing bridges are based upon this"], [371, "CLASSIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL STEELS. 343 \" drop of the beam,\" and there seems to be no good reason why one arbitrary point should be substituted for another, and no reason why future work should not be carried on under the present established and well-understood system. Sec 171. \u2014 General provisions on methods of testing. \u2014 (1) Rivet rods and other rounds are to be tested in the form in which they leave the rolls, without machining. Note. \u2014 This is apparently opposed to the recommendations of the International Conferences,* wherein it is proposed that round test-pieces shall be turned to one of four standard diameters, with shoulders and screw grip thread at each end, but it is stated elsewhere in the reports of the committee that only pieces for scientific investigation are to be prepared in this manner. (2) Test-pieces from angles, plates, shapes, etc., shall be rectangular in shape, with a cross-sectional area of about one half square inch, and shall be taken so that only two sides are machine finished, the other two having the surface which was in contact with the rolls in the last pass. Note. \u2014 The report of the committee above mentioned recom mends this method of cutting tests, but specifies that there shall be shoulders at each end. This necessitates considerable extra machine work without any notable effect upon the result. The limitation of the area of the piece prevents the passing of inferior material by an unusual increase in width. (3) Should fracture occur outside of the middle third of the gauge length, the test is to be discarded as worthless if it falls below the standard. Note. \u2014 This provision is copied from the report of the above committee, and is much to be commended. A deficient elon gation when the piece breaks near the end is not the fault of the material, but a mere accident. On eye-bars, a failure in the eye should condemn the method of forming the head rather than the quality of the steel. (4) In case one test-piece falls slightly below the require ments in any particular, the inspector shall allow the retesting of the lot or heat by taking four additional tests from the same lot or heat, and if the average of the five shall show that the steel is within the requirements, the metal shall be accepted. * Report of Committee on Standard Tests to the Am. Soc. Mech. Eng., Appendix V."], [372, "344 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. (5) Drillings for chemical analysis may be taken either from the preliminary test-piece or from the finished material, but if the sample be taken from the center of a sheared or universal-mill plate, the maximum limit of both phosphorus and sulphur shall be raised 25 percent.; e. g., from .04 to .05 per cent., or .08 to .10 per cent. (6) The pulling speed of the machine for breaking test pieces shall not be less than one-quarter inch per minute, nor more than three inches per minute. (7) The elastic limit shall be determined by the dropping of the beam. Sec 172. \u2014 Classes of steel proposed. \u2014 The following specifi cations do not deal with metal for special purposes, like gun carriages, armor plate, etc., but are intended to cover more or less fully the needs of the structural engineer. I do not expect that they will ever be adopted in their entirety as standard requirements, but this seems to be the simplest form in which to condense the investigations that have been recorded in the foregoing chapters, and to present the varia tions in the physical properties caused by changes in the history and section of the test-piece. Engineers who do not wish to cumber their specifications with so many allowances for thickness and section, will find herein the reason for many troublesome questions arising in the testing of the material, for I have tried to tabulate, as fairly as can be estimated, the effect of conditions that are ruled more by the laws of nature than by the skill of the manufacturer. At the same time it will be found that the matter is not as complicated as would be indicated at first sight, for one page of general provisions and one page of physical limits for each kind of steel can hardly be called a very voluminous docu ment to cover the specifications upon structural shapes. The engineer who will compare the proposed requirements with what is demanded in other countries, will find a remark able difference. The specifications which are in general use in Germany are as follows :* * Normalbedingungen fur die Lieferung von Eisenconstruktionen far Brticken und Hochbau, Otto Meissner, 1893; also, Ueber die Arbeiten der Flusseisen-Com mission, F. Kintzle, 1892."], [373, "345 CLASSIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL STEELS. For Bivets. \u2014 Ultimate strength from 51200 to 59700 pounds per square inch; elongation 22 per cent, in eight inches. For other structural material. \u2014 Lengthwise tests : Ultimate strength from 52600 to 62600 pounds per square inch ; elonga tion 20 per cent, in eight inches. Crosswise tests : Ultimate strength from 51200 to 64000 pounds per square inch ; elongation 17 per cent, in eight inches. These are given as the limits accepted by the leading engi neering societies of that country, and I am informed by Mr. Kintzle* that they represent the general requirements at the present time for all classes of material. It is safe to say that if American engineers were satisfied w*ith the German stand ards, there would not be one rejection for deficient ductility where there are twenty under our more rigid requirements ; and if they would be content with a steel having an ultimate strength between 52000 and 62000 pounds per square inch, there would not be one-fifth the number of heats discarded for being outside of the tensile limits. The bearing of these facts upon the cost of the material is self-evident. I do not advocate any sacrifice of strength to economy, but 1 would impress upon American engineers that this soft metal is eminently suitable for structural work, while by maintain ing their present chemical limitations and their requirements concerning ductility, they will be assured of a material which is equal in quality to any produced in the world.

They are here given in full, since the clauses relating to the inspection of material, and the allowance for overweights, apply equally to all classes of material. The Association did not limit the use of this metal to buildings not exposed to shock, for the matter of chemical composition was left open to the engineer, but in common with almost all manufacturers, I must unqualifiedly condemn the use of metal for a railway bridge that contains over .08 per cent, of phosphorus, while I believe that .06 per cent. should be the upper limit. mth stren I square nate - 1 1 . . is per inch. u o ft Fl .- Shape and origin of test-piece. s a s i E a B S a 7.

Also, when a large number of simi lar pieces are to be made, that special bending or drop tests be devised, such tests, together with the chemical analysis, to be the sole requirements. See also general provisions in Section 171. Sec. 173. \u2014 The quench-test. \u2014 In these specifications there is nothing said about a quench-test, for I am of the opinion that it is an absurdity when applied to ordinary structural material. It was defended by Mr. Hunt* on the ground that it would guard against material that would be injured by careless heating and cooling in the mill or shops, but this suggests the query why such carelessness should be tolerated. It is assumed that the work is done by mills and shops that under stand their business, and the steel should be made to fit the work in hand and not the ignorance of middlemen. It is right to make the most severe tests on the cold proper ties, for the derailment of a train will subject certain mem bers to great deformation ; such an accident is always a possibility which human foresight seems powerless to avoid, but the carelessness in the shop stands on a different footing, for it is caused by positive and unnecessary acts in error. Moreover, the quench-test depends very much upon slight differences in the methods of heating and cooling, differences which are almost imperceptible and unexplainable, and the same steel may be made to pass or fail under modes of treat ment wrhich seem to be inherently identical. It would appear, therefore, that no warrant exists for the imposition of this test upon the material for a railroad bridge, which is not calcu lated to withstand a conflagration followed by a flood. This position is being taken by a very large number of engineers, and a quench-test is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. In concluding this chapter it may be w*ell to quote the words of the chief of one of the most widely and favorably known plate mills of our country. The opinions are taken from a private letter, and, being never intended for publication, are free from all taint of business interest. \" I am honestly of the opinion that the complicated specifi cations that have been written in late years have really * The Inspection of Materials of Construction in the United States.

Personally I should be willing to buy of the most reputable makers, trusting to them to use the proper care in manufac ture, and relying rather on properly conducted bending tests and chemical analysis than on tensile tests ; but as we probably cannot bring the engineer to this mind, I shall be very glad if anything can be done to moderate his misdirected zeal.\""], [388, "360 CHAPTER XIX. WELDING. Section 174. \u2014 Influence of structure on the welding proper ties. \u2014 Wrought-iron may be welded so that the point of union is as strong as the rest of the bar, for by upsetting the piece there can be an extra amount of work put upon the metal, and since the strength of the original bar was dependent upon the perfection of a great number of welds, it follows that the additional local heating and hammering may give a superior strength. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case, and it is seldom that failure does not take place in the neighborhood of the weld under destructive tests. It often does happen that a rod will break a short distance away from the actual point of union, but in spite of current supposition this by no means shows perfect workmanship, for it usually arises from the overheating of the iron at the point of fracture, without sufficient subsequent work to develop a proper structure. In working steel the conditions are fundamentally different, for the bar is not a collection of fibres and welds but a thing complete in itself, so that it is impossible to make any improve ment in a properly worked piece by cutting it in halves and putting it together again. It is quite conceivable that a bar may originally be underworked or overheated, and that addi tional local work can enhance the strength at the point of welding, but this assumption of a bad material to start with may be neglected. It is also possible to finish the hammering on a welded piece at a very low temperature and thereby exalt the ultimate strength beyond the true value, but inas much as this will give a less ductile and unreliable material, it will not be considered. It is also possible, much more than with wrought-iron, to"], [389, "361 WELDING. have the weld stronger than a certain adjacent part of the bar, for the best of steel will be crystallized by high heat somewhat more readily than wrought-iron, and hence it can and often does happen that the metal in the neighborhood of a weld has a bad structure due to lack of hammering after high heating. The higher the critical temperature necessary to produce crystallization, the less is the danger from this source, so that, aside from the mere facility of welding at point of contact, the freedom from phosphorus and sulphur is a matter of prime importance, since both of these elements render the metal less able to withstand high temperatures. The fundamental difference in crystallizing power between wrought-iron and steel makes a close comparison of the two impossible, but nevertheless it may be profitable to quote from Holley the following conclusions concerning iron.* \" (1) None of the ingredients except carbon in the propor tions present seems to very notably affect the welding by ordinary methods. [The maximum percentages were P, .317 ; Si, .321; Mn, .097; S, .015; Cu, .43; Ni, .34; Co, .11; Slag, 2.262.] \" (2) The welding power by ordinary methods is varied as much by the amount of reduction in rolling as bj* the ordinary differences in composition. \" (3) The ordinary practice of welding is capable of radical improvement., the most promising field being in the direction of welding in a non-oxidizing atmosphere.\" Sec 175. \u2014 Tensile tests on welded bars of steel andiron. \u2014 A glance at the allowable contents of metalloids, as given in the foregoing synopsis, will show the wide gulf that separates iron from steel, and this will be still further indicated by Table 135, which gives the tensile tests on a series of welded steel bars of different compositions, the investigation having been conducted under my own direction. The total lack of certainty and regularity in the results is evident, and it should therefore be said that the smiths were men of long experience in handling steel, and they fully understood that the indi vidual results were to be compared. The bars were of a size * The Strength of Wrought- Iron as Affected by its Composition and by its Reduc tion in Rolling. Trans. A. I. M.

In most cases where the test-bar broke in the weld, the pieces parted at the surfaces of contact, showing that no true union had taken place; one or two fractures were homogeneous, but they showed the coarse crystallization that follows overheating. The lap welds represent the method ordinarily used in making pipe, and are really a better criterion of the welding quality of the steel than the round pieces, for in making the union the pieces were simply laid together with no upsetting, and hence there was less chance for the manipulations of the smith. All of this steel, both Bessemer and open-hearth, had been pronounced suitable for the making of pipe, although it will be a revelation to most metallurgists that such a high content of copper could possibly be allowed. In all cases the bars broke across the weld with a more or less crystalline fracture, there being no instance where the separation was at the plane of union, so that, while thorough welding was proven, it was also evident from the lessened ductility that the metal was overheated during the operation. Table 136. Welding Tests by the Royal Prussian Testing Institute. The figures on the iron bars show that the situation is no better than with steel, for the welded bars are far inferior to the natural piece both in strength and ductility. The general truth of these experiments is corroborated by Table 130, which gives a condensation of the results on a series of tests made by the Royal Prussian Testing Institute, the data being trans lated into American form.* \u2022 Journal I. and S.

In the softer steel the average was 71 per cent, and the poorest 33 per cent., while in the puddled iron the average was 81 per cent, and the poorest 62 per cent, The complete destruction of ductility is conclusively shown in the case of all three metals, even the wrought-iron being hope lessly wrecked. As above stated, the flat bars given in Table 135 were such as had been used successfully in making pipe which would stand all the ordinary tests of distortion, while the soft basic metal, made to fill the stringent requirements of the United States Government, would meet the most severe tests. Such metal is used regularly in certain branches of manufacture where the best welding qualities are required, and the users are firmly convinced that \" the weld is perfect,\" It may be possible to produce better results by special arrangements, but it must certainly be acknowledged that a weld as performed by ordinary blacksmiths and by the usual methods on the best metal, whether iron or steel, is not nearly as good as the rest of the bar ; and it is still more certain that welds of large rods of common forging steel are entirely unreliable and should not be employed in any structural work. Electric methods do not offer a solution of the problem, for during the process the metal is heated far beyond the critical temperature of crystallization, and only by heavy reductions under the hammer or press can much be done toward restor ing the ductility of the piece. In many cases this subsequent hammering is impracticable owing to the consequent deform ation of the piece. Sec. 176. \u2014 Influence of the metalloids upon the ivelding projyerties. \u2014 The way in which the impurities of the metal affect the welding power has been a matter of discussion, it having even been supposed that they act simply by interposi tion, and, again, that they increase the susceptibility of the iron to oxidation. I believe both of these theories are wrong. If the first were true, then one per cent, of carbon would have the same effect as one per cent, of sulphur, which is manifestly not the case. The second theory does not hold, since sulphur, which is notoriously one of the worst enemies"], [394, "366 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. of welding, is not oxidized either in the acid Bessemer or open-hearth furnace, and there is no ground for assuming that it oxidizes in welding. It will also be seen that as phos phorus, carbon, and manganese protect iron from burning in the Bessemer and open-hearth, so they must also tend to be pref erentially oxidized in a blacksmith's fire, and thus by pre venting the formation of iron oxide, as well as by the forma tion of a liquid flux containing phosphoric acid and oxide of manganese, they should, as far as oxidation is concerned, assist rather than retard the welding. A third theory is advanced that the impurities affect the mobility. When half of one per cent, of carbon is added to the metal, it produces a compactness or hardness, even when the steel is hot, that must prevent the easy flowing together that follows a pressure upon two pieces of white-hot wrought iron or soft steel. A higher temperature can not be used because every increase in carbon reduces the safe working temperature at the same time that it increases the stiffness. This decrease in mobility doubtless plays an important part in the explanation, but I believe that a greater influence is to be found in what may seem at first sight to be the same thing but which in reality is a different quality, viz. : The power, or property, of passing through a viscous state on the road to liquidity. There are other metals, lead and copper for instance, which are malleable and ductile, but which do not go through a history of slow softening under the application of heat, the change to a liquid state being sudden and with out any marked intermediate stage. Pig-iron is of the same character, for no matter how low the other metalloids may be, the presence of three per cent, of carbon produces a metal which changes suddenly from a solid to a liquid state, and it is reasonable to suppose that each increment of carbon, phos phorus, and manganese tends in the same direction. In addition to this effect, I believe that an equally important factor exists in the action of carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, and copper in destroying the quality of cohesion by increasing the tendency to crystallization, for it is well known that these metalloids lower the point at which the steel becomes what is incorrectly, but quite naturally, called \"burned.\" When the steel is overheated it crumbles under the hammer, and it"], [395, "WELDING. 367 is plain that it pan not be easily united to another piece when it is incapable of remaining united to itself. This theory also explains what seems to be a fact, that a small proportion of manganese aids in welding, for although it does decrease the mobility at any particular temperature, it allows a higher heat to be put upon the metal without the creation of a destructive crystallization, and thus indirectly renders possi ble a greater mobility and maintains a more favorable internal molecular structure. The following conclusions summarize what has just been given and seem to fit the theory and the facts : (1) With the exception of manganese in small proportion, the usual impurities in steel reduce its welding power by lowering the critical temperature at which it becomes coarsely crystalline. (2) A small content of manganese aids welding by prevent ing crystallization. (3) Only the purest and softest steel can be welded with any reasonable assurance of success. (4) The confidence of a smith in his own powers and his belief in the perfection of the weld, is no guarantee that the bar is fit to use."], [396, "368 CHAPTER XX STEEL CASTINGS. Section 177. \u2014 Definition of a steel casting. \u2014 Within the last few years steel castings have come into general use in the structural world, but there is still a lamentable ignorance concerning their nature. A steel casting by very definition must be made of steel which is cast in a fluid state into the desired shape. This leaves open to discussion the great ques tion considered in Chapter IV as to w*hat is included in the term \" steel,\" but although the making of a general definition is complicated by the possibility of producing \"puddled steel,\" there is no necessity of introducing this qualification into remarks on castings, since fluidity is an essential feature. As for the distinction between \" steel\" and the so-called \" ingot iron\", it is needless to say that endless confusion would be introduced in the trade if the soft products of the open-hearth were to be styled \"iron castings.\" Notwithstanding the plain limits which have been set by metallurgy and common sense, there is a cloud of error hang ing around the term \" steel castings,\" which is due partly to ignorance and partly to deliberate fraud. It has been the practice of some persons to make castings from a mixture of pig-iron and steel melted in a cupola, although every metal lurgist and every foundryman of intelligence knows that the metal is altered very much by remelting, and that the changes in silicon, manganese, and carbon depend on all the varying and uncertain factors of temperature and exposure. In melting ordinary pig-iron, the carbon usually changes very little, for, by the nature of the case, the content of this metalloid was adjusted in the blast-furnace to about the absorptive capacity corresponding to the manganese and silicon, and as the conditions in the cupola are similar ,to"], [397, "STEEL CASTINGS. 369 those in the blast-furnace, it follows that a metal which is the normal product of one will not be fundamentally altered by passing through the other. But a mixture of steel and iron is not a normal product of any furnace, and in its treatment in the cupola there is a tendency to make radical changes in the composition by the absorption of carbon. Thus, by the unnatural union of pig and scrap, and by the uncertain changes in silicon, manganese, and carbon, there is produced a hybrid metal which is useful for special purposes, but wdiich is fundamentally different from any kind of steel. It is true that scrap and iron are melted together to make open-hearth steel, but this is done under an oxidizing flame and, either during the melting or afterward, the metalloids are almost entirely eliminated, giving a definite starting point from which a known and regular metal can be made by the addition of proper recarburizers. Sometimes castings of cupola metal, made either w*ith or without scrap, are heated in contact with iron oxide in order to burn the contained metalloids. The product is a more or less tough metal, known as malleable iron, which is extensively employed in making small, thin, or complicated shapes that could scarcely be poured in steel, but which can be made of the more liquid iron. The attempt has been made to call these \"steel,\" and the claim has been fortified by analyses showing that the composition resembles that of some steel. The argument is too shallow for consideration, since, on the same basis, the product of the puddle-furnace or the charcoal bloomary might be termed \"mild steel.\" Malleable iron must always be inferior to steel, because any oxides of silicon, manganese, phosphorus, or iron which are formed remain diffused throughout the mass, thereby breaking to some extent the bond of continuity. Such castings are useful in a certain field, for they are far tougher than cast-iron, and they may even enter into compe tition with steel castings, but they must always bear a differ ent name, since steel castings must necessarily be made by pouring into finished shape the melted product of a crucible, a Bessemer converter, or an open-hearth furnace. Sec. 178. \u2014 Methods of manufacture. \u2014 The crucible process is sometimes employed for small castings, since the condi-"], [398, "370 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. tions of the \" dead-melt\" give a much more quiet metal, evolving less gas in contact with cold surfaces, and the casting is more apt to lie free from blow-holes. In certain special cases, as in the manufacture of big guns at Krupp's, the cruci ble has been used in making large masses of metal, but its great cost must prohibit its adoption for general structural work. The Bessemer has been used to some extent in the past for making steel castings, but it is utterly unfitted for the woric on account of the great cost of the operation when only two or three heats are required during the day. One way of obviat ing this is by taking an occasional heat from a Bessemer plant which is running regularly on other products, but this supposes, what is seldom the case, that the mixture is low in phos phorus. The day has passed away when a casting could be made of ordinary steel, and as it is now necessary to make a careful selection of the stock so that the content of phos phorus shall not exceed .04 per cent,, the melting furnace is the cheapest as well as the most efficient instrument of pro duction. Within the last few years there has been a revival of Bessemer castings due to special developments along certain lines of procedure which have been practiced in exceptional cases for many years. After the drop of the carbon flame, a certain amount of melted ferro-silicon is added to the bath and the blowing resumed. The silicon is oxidized and pro duces a very high temperature, so that the steel can be poured into very small castings without danger of scull. This latter point is one of the most important advantages claimed for this method of manufacture. It may be well, therefore, to say that there is no difficulty at all in a good open hearth furnace in making steel just as hot as can be wanted ; in fact, considerable care must be exercised to keep the metal from being too hot. On some kinds of work an excess of temperature may not cause trouble, but in other cases the open-hearth furnace offers far better opportunities for that complete control of temrjerature and casting conditions which is so desirable and so essential. The open-hearth furnace also allows more perfect control over the casting conditions. A basic hearth is sometimes"], [399, "STEEL CASTINGS. 371 nsed and has a slight advantage in the ability to make low phosphorus without much extra cost, but basic metal seems to be more \" lively\" in casting, and hence there is greater danger of honeycombs. The expense account of molding, drying, and chipping is so great under any system of manu facture that it does not pay to save a dollar a ton on the raw material when four times as much is lost on the finished pro ducts, and it will be found that the true way to make good castings is to melt the best obtainable stock in an acid-lined open-hearth furnace. Sec 179. \u2014 Blow-holes. \u2014 The use of good stock determines to a great extent the nature of the product, but it does not in the least influence the solidity of the castings. This depends partly on the temperature and composition of slag and metal before tapping, and partly on the quantity and nature of the recarburizing additions. An increase in these latter agents covers up the errors in furnace manipulation, but shows itself in a higher content of metalloids. Honeycombed metal may arise from bad casting conditions or it may come from a laud able desire to reduce to the lowest possible point the propor tions of silicon and manganese, for the manufacturer well knows that the blow-holes decrease only slightly the strength and toughness of a casting, w-hile the complete removal of them by overdoses of metalloids gives a brittle metal. It is the current impression that during the last few years all the difficulties in making sound castings have been completely overcome by the introduction of metallic aluminum and certain alloys of silicon. It is true that great progress has been made, but there is no magic wand for sale which can be waved over a ladleful of steel to \" kill\" it \" dead.\" Had field,* in an able article on the use of aluminum, says : \" There is no rapid or royal road to the production of sound steel castings ; this is only attained by long experience combined w*ith specialized knowledge.\" Some engineers specify that the cavities shall not exceed a certain percentage of the total area, but the common-sense method is to clothe the inspector with discretionary power, for a flaw may be perfectly harmless on the under surface of a base-plate when it would be fatal in the rim of a wheel. In \u2022 Aluminum Steel. Journal I. and S. I., Vol. II. 1890, p. 174."], [400, "372 MANTFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. this connection it should be noted that there is a radical difference between a \"blow-hole\" and a \"pipe.\" The cavities which may often be seen where the \" sink-head\" or \" riser\" is cut off, are not evidence of unsoundness but exactly the opposite, for they show that feeding has continued after the riser was exhausted, and that the hidden interior has been rendered solid at the expense of the visible surface. Sec. 180. \u2014 Phosphorus and sulphur in steel castings. \u2014 In writing the specifications for steel castings, the most import ant point is to state that phosphorus shall not exceed .04 per cent. An excess of the other elements may be guarded against by requiring a proper ductility, but phosphorus, although influencing to some extent the ordinary testing history, is often masked by other factors, and manifests itself only at a later time in that brittleness under shock which is its inherent characteristic. This is an important matter in the case of rolled metal, but it is of much more vital moment in steel castings, for these will generally fail, not by being pulled and stretched to destruction, but by sudden strain and shock. The content of sulphur is of little importance to the user, for it affects the cold properties very slightly, but it will do no harm to specify that it shall not be over .05 per cent., good castings generally containing less than this proportion. Copper need not be mentioned, for there is no evidence that it has any influence upon the finished casting. Sec. 181. \u2014 Effect of silicon, manganese, and aluminum. \u2014 The elements used to procure solidity are silicon, manganese, and aluminum. Their value to the steelmaker is due in great measure to their power of uniting with oxygen, the action being as follows : 3.44 parts manganese unite with 1.00 part of oxygen. 3.44 \" aluminum \" \" 3.01 parts 3.44 \" silicon \" \" 3.93 \" \" Hence the aluminum is three times, and the silicon four times, as efficient as manganese, weight for weight, while they have an additional value from their greater affinity for oxygen, since this enables them to seize the last traces from the iron and wash the bath so much the cleaner. Another function which may play a part in the operation"], [401, "373 STEEL CASTINGS. is the increase in capacity to dissolve or occlude gases, and as far as the value of the casting is concerned this will be equivalent to destroying them. It is not known how far this determines the situation, but it is evident that it has no con nection with the power to unite with oxygen. It was once thought that aluminum increased the fluidity of steel by lowering the point of fusion, but experiments with a Le Chatelier pyrometer* gave the same melting point of 1475\u00b0 C. for ordinary soft steel as for an alloy with five per cent, of aluminum. The tendency of both aluminum and silicon is to make the steel creamy and sluggish ; it is true that such metal will run through small passages without chilling better than ordinary steel, but this is because the latter foams and froths when in contact with cold surfaces, and the flow is thereby impeded and sufficient surface exposed to chill the advance guard of the stream. The percentage of manganese should not exceed .70 in soft castings nor .80 in harder steels, since more than this may render the metal liable to crack under shock. Silicon can be present up to .10 per cent, in the mild steels and .35 per cent, in the hard Avithout any appreciable diminution in toughness. Aluminum is seldom present except in traces, and should not be over .20 per cent., for it decreases the ductility. The carbon must vary* according to the desired tensile strength and the use to which the casting is to be put. When it is over .70 per cent, the steel becomes so hard that machining is slow, and there is danger of lines of weakness from shrinkage in complicated shapes. Sec 182. \u2014 Physical tests on soft steel castings. \u2014 Since the failure of cast-work is almost always due to sudden strain, it is the safer plan to have the metal for common purposes between .30 and .50 per cent, in carbon, but when great toughness is required it should not be over .15 per cent. This latter specification also presupposes a low content of manga nese, silicon, and, above all, of phosphorus ; with this compo sition the casting displays all the characteristics usually asso ciated with the toughest of rolled shapes. A test on an unannealed gear-wheel of such metal, manufactured by The * See article on Pyrometric Data, by H. M. Howe, Engineering and Mining Journal, October 11, 1890, p. 426."], [402, "374 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. Pennsylvania Steel Company, was made by cutting the rim between the spokes and then bending one arm to a right. angle, twisting another through more than 180\u00b0 without sign of fracture, while a third was hot-forged from a star-shaped section of about 2 inches by 1. inches into a bar 1\u00a3 inches by three-eighths inch, and after being cooled was twisted into a closed corkscrew. Similar pieces were exhibited by Krupp in his magnificent exhibit at Chicago, but we stand ready in America to duplicate any such metal on regular contracts. Such trials, made on castings taken at random, are far pref erable to tensile tests from sample bars, since the small pieces will not be in exactly the same physical condition as the larger castings. Such bars have a certain value, however, and avoid the necessity of spoiling good finished work. It is well to keep in mind that a flaw or blow-hole in the small test does not necessarily imply that the casting contains similar imperfections, and also that while an open cavity, however small, which is visible on the surface of a machined test will have a disastrous effect upon the strength and ductility, it might be of slight importance if buried in the interior. This necessity of having a perfect surface makes it difficult to con duct a long series of tests with exactly the same dimension of test-piece, for if five-eighths inch in diameter is the de sired size, it may be necessary to turn some of the pieces to one-half inch, while the length must sometimes be reduced to 6 or to 4 inches. This test-piece should not be annealed unless the castings themselves are to be treated in the same manner, and although it is customary to anneal most structural work, the trouble is not necessary in a great many cases if the very best of stock is used. This statement will be called heretical by many engineers, but the tests that have just been recorded upon an unannealed gear-wheel will show that the metal can be exceptionally tough in its original state. The Pennsylvania Steel Company has made hundreds of very thin gear-wheels of considerable size for use in agri cultural machinery, where everything is sacrificed to lightness, and although none of these have been annealed we have yet to hear of complaints of breakage. We have also made many rolls and pinions for rolling mills, and these are exposed to"], [403, "375 STEEL CASTINGS. the most arduous service of stress and shock, but they almost always wear out rather than break. It is undeniable that proper annealing gives a finer grain to a casting of good composition, but, on the other hand, it does not affect the grain if the metal is high in phosphorus. It is also certain that reheating removes internal strains, so that it would be of advantage in very complicated castings) especially where the interior corners are very sharp, but such corners can almost always be avoided by a little care. It will be granted that the agricultural gear-wheels just mentioned must, by virtue of their shape and thinness, be subject to severe internal strains, and if annealing can be dispensed with in their case, it is certainly unnecessary in many other cases when the very best stock is used. It is the general opinion that annealing is advisable and even neces sary, but I repeat that The Pennsylvania Steel Company, while it does so treat its product- when demanded by the specifications, does not apply this process to castings that are to be used in its own rolling mills, since the metal in its natural state seems to be able to withstand all that would be expected of an annealed piece. Up to within a few years most steel castings were made of hard metal containing from .30 to .50 per cent, of carbon, and having a tensile strength of 80,000 to 100,000 pounds per square inch. But just as engineers have long since learned that the strongest and safest bridge is not built of rolled steel with .30 per cent, of carbon, so they must learn that in still greater measure it would be better to use a softer metal in castings. Table 137 gives the results of tests made on sample bars of cast steel, showing the composition and physical qualities. The silicon is not given, but it was below* .05 per cent, in every case. The test-piece was not cut from the casting itself, but from a small coupon which is much more likely to contain blow-holes, and this will explain why it was often necessary to pull the piece in a 6-inch length. The test was round in every case, and therefore gave slightly worse results than a flat, but this is far from explaining the great inferiority of the casting when compared with the preliminary test, or the much more marked difference from what should be expected in properly rolled steel of similar tensile strength."], [404, "376 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. The results show what has so often been mentioned in these pages \u2014 that the ultimate strength and elastic limit are altered very little by the amount of work upon the piece as long as it is not finished at a low temperature. Thus, in the annealed casting the elastic limit is 56.62 per cent, of the ultimate strength, while in the annealed bars rolled from the ingot it is 57.39 per cent. This approximation is remarkable because the factors relating to ductility show that the physi cal state of the two metals must be radically different. Table 137.

This will be shown by Table 138, which gives the results on duplicate bars from four different heats of harder metal. Table 138. Physical Properties of Annealed Bars cut from Castings of Medium Hard Steel ; all bars \u00a3 inch in Diameter. Manufactured by The Pennsylvania Steel Company. It will be seen that the ultimate strength is fairly regular, and this indicates that the metal itself is homogeneous but that minute imperfections give rise to the variations in the elongation, reduction of area, and elastic ratio. In the body of a casting these defects exert little influence, but they seriously affect the integrity of a small machined piece. This will emphasize the statement already made that the safest way, whenever practicable, would be to make a drop test on a sample casting rather than to cut a small bar from the piece or from a separate coupon. u c x \u2014 a 9- C.

INSPECTION. Section 181. \u2014 Causes of friction between manufacturer and inspector. \u2014 Nothing is easier than to write in one sentence the self-evident laws that should govern the inspection of steel, for the manufacturer should supply exactly what is required and the inspector should receive nothing else. If the steel does not fulfill the specifications, it is most certainly the fault of the maker, and all the chances and losses of error should have been taken into consideration in making the con tract. Moreover, the inspector is only an agent, and he violates his trust in accepting anything that falls outside the limits which, either wisely or foolishly, have been set by his principal. These facts are patent, and it may seem strange that any misunderstanding can possibly come in their practice ; but such trouble does arise, and it will be to the advantage of all concerned if the points of difference are discussed. The main causes of disagreement are as follows : (1) Dishonesty of the manufacturers. (2) Open disregard of specifications by the manufacturers. (3) Bad construction of the specifications. (1) Conscientiousness and non-discretionary powers of the inspector. The dishonesty of the manufacturer is a sad fact which occasionally appears in evidence, but where one instance becomes known there are a dozen that escape observa tion, for cheating is so easy in the majority of cases, even with careful supervision, that the temptation is hard to over come when large financial stakes are put in hazard by absurd restrictions ; but the habit once formed is too easily extended from the protection of self to the defrauding of others. It"], [407, "INSPECTION. 379 is a physical impossibility for any one or any ten men to follow the material through the processes of manufacture to see that no false marking is done, and although it is true that the buyer has the privilege of investigating the steel at a subsequent time, every one knows that engineers do not go into the erecting shops and cut pieces out of the angles, each one of which is made to fit some one place in the structure, and then test and analyze the samples. Moreover, a dozen random tests would not show that some pieces were not wrongly marked, or that some of the metal was not entirely outside of the specifications. It must also be considered that no ordinary tests can dis tinguish between Bessemer and open-hearth steel, or between acid and basic steel, while it is only the laboratory which can find whether the phosphorus is high or low. It is nevertheless a fraud for the maker to use one when the other is specified, and it is none the less a fraud on the part of the engineer toward all competitors for the contract if any change is made in the prescribed method of manufacture after making the award. Sec. 185. \u2014 Responsibility of inspectors. \u2014 Inspectors should be obliged to make reports based on their own knowledge ; they should know how the steel is made, and, when any fraud is suspected, should pick out the bars from which the tests are to be cut, watch these bars and see that no substitution is allowed, take drillings to unbiased and responsible chemists, and by all other means endeavor to stop the deceptions which place the honest manufacturer at a disadvantage, as well as nullify the calculations of the engineer. In so doing it is necessary to enforce the spirit rather than the letter of the law. In order to reduce the friction to a minimum, the in spector should be clothed with some discretionary power, for chemists will differ, and steel will not be absolutely uniform, and different rolled sections will give different results, but the general intention of the engineer can be carried out, and true records made of the metal which is used. Some engineers require that inspectors shall watch every detail of manufacture by night and day. This provision may be necessary in some cases, but it is sometimes very unjust. A contract is often divided among two or more works, and it"], [408, "380 MANTFACTFRE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. may happen that one of these succeeds in overcoming certain difficulties by ingenuity and study. Such an advantage is the rightful property of the originator, and the works making the discovery is entitled to all the gain that may result therefrom. Under the inquisitory system just mentioned it is impos sible to keep secret any detail of manipulation, since the in spectors, who travel from one works to another, will naturally carry such information, and will volunteer any assistance in their power to unsuccessful manufacturers. This may be done from the most commendable motives and it is impossible to condemn the practice, but the result is much more pleasant to Utopian philosophers than to business rivals. The disregard of specifications by the manufacturer often appears in substituting Bessemer metal for open-hearth, or basic steel in place of acid, or in a defiant attempt to make a steel of a different chemical composition from what is re quired. Assuming that the physical quality is the final crite rion, a steel is furnished which passes the tensile tests, and the claim is made that, since these are filled, the material must be accepted. Astonishing, absurd, and untenable as this position is, there are cases where it has been taken and where the material has been accepted. Needless to say that by so doing the engineer places himself in an unfair relation to every works which made a bid on the better quality ol material, and needless to say that such a transaction casts a deep shadow of doubt over the intention and the force of every clause in future contracts. Sec. 186. \u2014 Errors in engineering specifications. \u2014 Such a concession is an open acknowledgment that the specifications were written in ignorance or error, and while it would be well if such error were recognized whenever it exists, it would also be well if carefully considered requirements were rigidly enforced. Oftentimes there are details which are plainly the result of carelessness, and these furnish an excuse for righteous wrath on the part of the manufacturer. A case as this kind occurred in filling a large contract embracing a number of foundation bolts and similar forgings. Part of these were to be made of steel running from 70000 to 80000 pounds tensile strength, while the rest were to be from 72000 to 82000. The cause of this absurdity was a change in manage-"], [409, "INSPECTION. 381 ment during the progress of the construction with a revision of the specifications, and while the requirements for a certain portion were allowed to remain unaltered, new regulations were made for exactly similar bolts and rods for the rest of the work. In this case the reason for the divergence was evidently not in any way the result of intention, but simply an accident, and yet the inspector conscientiously refused to accept steel running 71500 pounds for one bolt, while for another, intended for exactly the same purpose, he would accept 70100 pounds. This trouble could possibly have been remedied by a short consultation with the engineer, but in this case he was three thousand miles away and was himself but a part of a complicated system of red-tape. The possible mistakes in the specifications call for a certain amount of discretionary* power on the part of the inspector, but such power is needed also to settle some small questions of detail arising in the manufacture. Thus, during the construc tion of a large train shed, it was found that a few angles were needed of a certain special size and section not on hand. The labor and time necessary to put in rolls to make them would have cost many times what the angles were worth, but it was necessary to make a hard fight for permission to use some angles of the same section and the same analysis and character, but Avhich were from one-sixteenth to one-eighth inch thicker than called for. Now, it is perfectly conceivable that in a war vessel, Avhere every pound is figured upon, a conscientious inspector would refuse to accept anything be yond the limit, and it is also conceivable that in the building of a long-span bridge the weights of all materials should be carefully watched ; but that the same care is necessary, in the face of great expense and delay, in a small-span train shed, w*hich would never have anything to do but keep the rain from the ground beneath, is one of those preposterous conceits which could only arise from misguided honesty. A still more striking example occurred in the assembling of the angles and plates composing certain large members where it was necessary to use a few long, narrow strips not over one-sixteenth of an inch in thickness, as filling pieces between riveted w*ork of perhaps one and one-half inches in thickness. Although this Avas simply a w*asher, and although any store-"], [410, "382 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL. house could supply perfectly suitable sheets of ordinary steel, the inspector required that the steel be made especially for the place, and that it should be just the same in chemical composition and physical characteristics as the angles and plates with which it was united, although this necessitated the making of special contracts with sheet mills and the delay of the erecting work. The manufacturer does not like to bother the engineer with all these petty details arising from day to day, as it would be human nature for the busy man to answer after several such questions that contracts were made to be carried out. What the honest business man wants is a thoroughly competent inspector who knows how to make sure that he is getting what is called for ; who may examine a turnbuckle with a magnifying glass, but pays less attention to an angle for a hand railing; who hammers a fire-box sheet until he knows it is right, but is a little lenient with a gusset-plate. The proper way, in most cases, would be to place the whole matter of inspection in the hands of a competent, man, who should have full authority to make such concessions or such extra tests as seem desirable during the progress of the work, in order that, on the one hand, the manufacturer is fairly treated, and, on the other, that the material is fully up to the standard required. Under any system, most of the routine work will probably be done by subordinates who are not quali fied to decide all questions that may arise, but the chiefs of American inspection bureaus are fully capable of meeting all responsibility. They are specialists, who know much more about the quality and nature of steel than the constructive engineer who deals with the designing and construction of caissons and trusses. In this function of consulting expert to the bridge engineer, these inspectors will find that the con scientious manufacturer is their friend and not their enemy. In former days the surface inspection of the material was the most important function of the inspector ; to-day it is the least of his duties. In fact, it has become such a matter of form that there is a tendency toward its complete abolition. There is much to be said in favor of such a step, for it is acknowl edged by all manufacturers that if an imperfection is discov ered in any piece of steel, no matter if it has passed through"], [411, "INSPECTION. 383 the hands of a dozen inspectors, the defective member must be replaced. This is done without argument, it being recog nized that the maker must stand behind his goods. Granting this condition, it will be evident that it is far better for the manufacturer to reject all unsuitable bars at the mill than to have them thrown out after delivery at distant points, and it will therefore be to his interest to properly inspect all material before shipment. For this reason it is the universal custom at rolling mills to have certain men whose sole duty it is to examine the product as fast as it is made, and separate the defective bars. This is done after the bars are straightened, and before they reach the loading beds, so that there is no further sorting to be done in the shipping yard. The mill inspection is so carefully done in well-conducted works that it is an unusual thing for an outside inspector to reject bars, and it would be still more thoroughly performed if the manufacturer knew that the responsibility rested with him alone. In the cases where the material is to be passed upon by an outside inspector, the natural tendency is to let doubtful bars go by, since the responsibility of their acceptance is to rest upon other shoulders. These facts are so well known that some of the best and most careful engineers in the country, including those who are most stringent in their demands concerning the chemical and physical qualities, do not make any surface inspection, but notify the manufacturer that the entire responsibility rests with him, and that a bar showing manifest flaws must be replaced, even though it has passed through every hand and has been placed in position. Whether this practice be generally accepted or not, it is eminently desirable that the inspection bureaus should arrange to examine the material as fast as it is made, so that the delays and expense of double handling of stock may be avoided. It often happens that such handling costs more than the inspection bureau receives for its work, and it is certainly an equitable request that some action be taken to remedy this loss. The solution of this problem lies in the cooperation of the manufacturer, the inspector, and the engineer, with a realization of the fact that the interest of one is the interest of all."], [412, "384 MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL STEEL.
