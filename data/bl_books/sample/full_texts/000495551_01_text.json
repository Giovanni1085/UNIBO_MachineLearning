In preparing a work which should form at once a complement and an introduc- tion to the Editor's treatises on the Ethnology and Political Geography of the World, it was at first thought that this end might be suitably attained by a translation \u2014 with some additions, abridgement, and other modifications \u2014 of the \" Allgemeine Erdkunde \" which forms the first three sections of Professor Alfred KirchhofPs \" Unser Wissen von der Erde.\" Of this work, the Geology was written by the late Dr. Ferdinand v. Hochstetter, the Biological Geography by Dr. Alois Pokorny, and the Meteorology, \" Geo-physics,\" and Astronomy, by Dr. Jul. Hann \u2014 all men of pre-eminent fitness for the task allotted to them. But after going more critically into the subject, it was found advisable to depart from this intention. The \"Allgemeine Erdkunde\" is written too completely with an eye to the wants of Germany and especially of South Germany, to render it of much value to English readers without many impor- tant modifications. Facts and theories, illustrations and the relative importance of the subjects described, are too exclusively selected from Austria and the Eastern Alps, or are so carefully reduced to the meridian of Vienna, as to make them only partially intelligible to those whose homes are in Great Britain, America, or the British Colonies. Questions of purely local or technical interest are discussed at inordinate length, while others of greater concern to the reader for whom this series of works is intended, are dismissed with undue curtness, or are altogether neglected. In some cases, also, the writers give currency to opinions or advocate views which the Editor could not take it upon himself to support ; and in nearly every instance the style of the German writers lacks something of that lucidity essential in a book which is not prepared for geologists or geographers, but for those whose acquaintance with Physiography is of an elementary character. Accordingly, the changes which have been made are tantamount to a complete re-writing of the original treatise, and, so far as the first volume is concerned, to"], [12, "IV OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. \u25a0 the composition of what is, to all intents and purposes, an entirely new work. Nothing of the original has been retained, except what relates to the illustrations, and even these have been supplemented by many new cuts, with the object of rendering the text more easy of comprehension. In a work of this sort, which is the digest of a science to the archives of which hundreds of observers have contributed, the Editor must necessarily draw for his materials on many memoirs in many languages. These, he hopes, have in every case been duly acknowledged, except, of course, where the phenomena described are patent to every one. If, in an exceptional instance, he has inadvertently failed to refer any fact to its proper source, he can only explain that a considerable portion of the first volume is based upon his own prelections while Lecturer on Geology and Physical Geography in the Watt-Heriot College (School of Arts), Edinburgh. It may therefore have occasionally happened that, in dealing with data so numerous, a circumstance may have been quoted without the authority for it having been noted at the time. This, however, must be of rare occurrence. The Editor has only to add that though no section of the work is intended to play the part of a text-book on the subject, or to replace more special treatises, he trusts not to have omitted any discovery of essential importance among the many which he has gleaned from all accessible sources of information, among which his own observations and the correspondence of friends in many parts of the world may be allowed a prominent place.

There is dead matter and living matter ; there are objects animate and objects inanimate ; materials which are solid, liquid, or gaseous ; creatures which are born, grow, wane, and die ; and the hills, which from age to age seem never to change. Again, he is prone to conclude that while \" living \" Nature is constantly undergoing some transfor- mation, the inanimate portion of creation is stable, with the exception of the rivers, and the waves, and the winds which \" blow whither they list.\" It does not come within the purview of the untaught observer to recognise that the plants, and the animals, the sun, the moon, and the stars, are interdependent ; that the shape of a country affects the clouds which soar over it ; or that a range of hills or an expanse of plain are the leading factors in the wealth of one nation or in the culture of another. But by-and-by he discovers that they are all members of a single system, that the one could not exist without the other, and that the farmer who ploughs his fields far away from the roar of the \" many-sounding sea \" could not reckon on reaping his crop in the fulness of time, without the beneficent influence of that ocean which encircles itself with barren sand. In like manner, a study of the science which it is the purpose of these pages to unfold teaches us that the Arctic glacier, which grinds' its rugged way to the sea, is dependent for the ice which feeds it on the same influences which send the \"Amazon rolling through the Tropics, or covers the corn-lands of England with yellow grain. A movement of which we are unconscious makes half of a continent a blooming forest for six months of the year and a snowy waste for the remainder ; and, just as a trifling eccentricity of the Earth's orbit has rendered Northern Europe habitable, so an equally slight twist may aq-ain bring back the Glacial period and the concomitants of the mammoth. In brief, the forces of Nature, which have acted in exactly the same way from the beginning of Time until now, are so much members of one harmonious whole that the absence of one member of the system \u2014 an element seemingly of little moment \u2014 is disastrous to the remainder. It is"], [18, "2 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. as if a pin should be removed from a machine: the whole would either stand still, or, sooner or later, cease to act with either comfort or advantage. This fact\u2014 which to a naturalist is so elementary as to be little better than a truism does not seem to be always grasped by the poet or the painter. The rhymers whom Pope scarified in the \" Dunciad \" make, for example \u2014 \"In cold. December fragrant chaplets blow. And heavy harvests nod beneath the snow.\" But a closer observer of Nature than the poets of whom Elkanah Settle was the Laureate is occasionally quite as far astray. Take, for instance, Tennyson, in that passage which must be familiar to every one where Arthur tells \"the bold Sir Bedivere\" that he is going a long way with the weird women \u2014 \" ' To the island- valley of Avilion, Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, Nor ever wind blows loudly ; but it lies Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard-lawns And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea, Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.' ''' Such a spot might exist in Fairy Land ; in any region more prosaic it would be impos sible. Passing over the fact that the existence of the summer se'a would all but necessi tate the existence of rain from evaporation, and that the valley presupposes mountains, which would precipitate the moisture-laden clouds, it is clear that without rain there could be no \"orchard-lawns,\" and that an island-valley where the wind never blows would in time get so pestilential that, so far from being a spot where the king could heal him of his grievous wound, it would be a death-trap. In brief, accepting the Laureate's premisses, the physical geographer, who must eschew fancies in favour of realities \u2014 which, rightly considered, are quite as sublime \u2014 can only conclude that the island- valley of Avilion, if subject to the ordinary laws of Nature, must have been \u2014 \" a waste laud, where no one comes, Or hath come since the making of the world.' Yet the , dependence of one force of Nature on another is so beautiful that, if the painter who portrays a background of American plants to a picture relating to an incident which happened before Columbus sailed on his famous voyage, or makes birds disport themselves amid vegetation which belongs either to a country different from that which they inhabit, or in a condition which at once shows that they must have at that particular period been in their winter quarters, where very different surroundings obtain, if he would consider the necessities of the case, he would derive more pleasure from the composition of his work than the scientific critic from the analysis of it. There is, of course, no more reason why the Polar bear should have its home amid ice and snow than the brown species amid pine forests. And, except that Nature has ordered it dif ferently, the modern elephant might as lief live in Siberia, as its woolly kindred did when the world was younger than that of which we have personal knowledge. If, however, the environments of each animal are studied, it will be found that there are circumstances"], [19, "INTRODUCTION. 3 which render the home of each more appropriate to it than could be any other habitat, and that this appropriateness is due to the close interdependence of a host of elements, animate or inanimate. The explanation of what these are, how the one acts and reacts, opens out the whole field of physical geography \u2014 or, as it is sometimes called, \" physio graphy,\" to distinguish the description of the world in a state of Nature, and the forces which have made and kept it so, from that geography which consists of a description of the Earth as divided into territories, influenced, altered, and, it may be, transformed by man and his works. The causes which have made the South American Desert of Atacama (Fig. 1) a waterless waste, and the laws which enable a certain amount of life to exist there, constitute one department of the science ; the modern enterprise which has burrowed it with mines, run a railway across it, and has thus rendered it an object of contention between the three nations around it, constitutes the other and more human section of the Earth's description. The Living Earth. The ancients fabled the world in which we live to be an animate, sentient being ; and though possibly, according to the definitions of life which modern biologists have accepted, this opinion of the philosophers \"who were older\" and sometimes even \"wiser than we,\" must be dismissed as untenable, yet, in some respects, \"the Earth and the waters under the Earth \" show more mobility than many animals, and greater internal activity than most plants. The Earth is never at rest. It has undergone and is undergoing endless vicissitudes. The matter of which it is formed, though seemingly the model of all that is unchangeable, is in reality often in a state of perturbation and transformation. Not a grain of the solid matter of the globe was originally in the form which it at present assumes. What is now solid was formerly liquid ; what is at this moment in the shape of rocks deeply bedded, and far out of sight of the sea, was, in a remoter period of the world's history, formed by sediment deposited at the bottom of the ocean, or on the bed of some long-vanished lake. The \" mould \" on which flourish luxurious crops of plants, was at one time the debris of a rank vegetation, which grew on some still deeper soil. The hard beds of coal are the indurated and altered remains of forests which existed long before the human era of the world had begun to dawn. The vast reservoirs of petroleum were, on the other hand, most probably the tangible evidences of a great natural distillation of plants, which commenced at a date which it is vain to conjecture, and which, measured by our standards of chronology, would be too vague for comprehension. Every shower of rain which sweeps along the mountain side wears down the soil, and more or less appreciably alters the conformation of the country. The muddy river which flows to the sea carries with it a still more appreciable amount of the soil into which it cuts, to lay it as the foundation of the lands that are to be, miles possibly from the shore where it mingles its flood with the waters of the parent ocean. Indeed, it has been calculated that at the present rate of denudation, or wearing-away, the Andes will have disappeared in from 9,000,000 to 156,000,000 years, though, were the denuding influences of the globe concentrated on"], [20, "4 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. them alone, this great range would be swept from the American continent in 135,000 years, since the rate of wearing-away varies in certain river-basins from one foot in 700 years to one foot in 12,000 years, though, of course, in the case of waterfalls like that of Niagara, or when the circumstances are unfavourable for the soil in its battle with the water, the destruction is accomplished in a much more speedy manner. But this grinding-down action is never permitted to act alone. There is no such thing as monopoly in Nature. The earthquake may rend the rocks asunder, and make in a few seconds a frightful havoc of the puny labours of man during many centuries. Yet the volcano is ever and again vomiting up islands and mountains from the centre Fig. 1. \u2014 THE DESERT OF ATACAMA (SOUTH AMERICA), of the globe ; while the coral polyp, less slowly, but not less surely, is in like manner adding to the surface of dry land fit for human habitation. The Earth is, in truth, never at rest. If only the more violent of the movements of Enceladus, the imprisoned giant of classic times, are noticed and recorded in a people's chronicles, there is probably no period at which some movement is not in progress. As we shall learn by-and-by, there are portions of the Earth which are slowly sinking, though the depression is so gradual that it is only after long intervals that the fact can be demonstrated by the disappearance of marks made on rocks lying off the coast affected ; while other sections, often in immediate contiguity, are just as slowly rising. But an examination of some of these localities, such as a district in Southern Sweden, proves that the reverse pro cess had at one period been in progress \u2014 in other words, that the region now sinking was then rising, and vice versa. It thus appears that the poets are wrong again. It is the sea which is stable ; it is the land which is unstable. * Yet though the sea, by the equilibrium of the forces concerned, manages to preserve"], [21, "INTRODUCTION. 5 its level, it is by no means exempt from that constant change which it is the law of Nature for every created thing to undergo. The sea is the creation of the rains and the rivers, and the rains, and their offspring the rivers, are equally dependent on the evaporation which is continually rising from the sea. Were not this ceaseless interchange taking place, the great lakes and the sea itself would become like the \" painted ocean \" of the \" Ancient Mariner ; \" it would become stagnant, putrefy, and in time disappear. The inland lakes seem never much bigger or much smaller, taking one season with another. But they Fig. '2. \u2014 THE DEAD SEA (PALESTINE would soon be dry were it not for the rivers which feed them. In northern climates this supply, which flows in from the drainage, either in the form of rivers or of springs, which are only forms of the same thing, is more than equal to the evaporation, and in part, at least, flows out again in the form of a second river. But in drier regions this does not happen. Hence the Dead Sea (Fig. 2) and the Great Salt Lake of Utah, though fed by rivers, never overflow, in spite of the fact that they have no defluents, the tribute which the sim claims by evaporation being sufficient to keep up their equilibrium. In some parts of the world, as in Central Asia, are found the dried-up beds of lakes which have disappeared ; and in many other regions, where the timber has been recklessly destroyed, the rainfall has diminished, and with it the size of the rivers, while every here and there dark loamy places appear, where, at some former period, lakes have evidently existed. This, according to the writer's observations, is true, among other countries, of Morocco and the Barbary States generally."], [22, "6 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. But it is self-evident that neither the rivers nor the springs which feed the great \" standing \" accumulations of water could exist, were it not for the evaporation from the surface of the latter, or in a less degree from the soil on which the rain falls before it sinks into the earth to form the reservoirs of springs. This vapour, raised up by the action of the sun, accumulates in clouds. Some of these clouds impinge on the top of Alpine peaks, or drift into the far North, where they discharge their contents\u2014 or rather, their substance\u2014 in the shape of snow. This snow, accumulating in lofty regions during the winter more quickly than it is dissolved during the summer, forms a glacier which, slowly descending into the warmer valleys, is dissolved, and adds its water to the sub glacier streams, which by-and-by join the glacier rivers, eventually to find its way to the sea, from which it originally sprang, though in the course of its ceaseless transformation it has undergone more inorganic metempsychoses than Gautama Buddha. If it is blown into the Polar air, it equally descends in the form of snow, which, contributing to that \" inland ice \" of the Arctic continent and islands, gives birth to the glaciers which, reaching the sea, release themselves in the guise of icebergs. These icebergs again float southward and, melting under the heat of the sea and the atmosphere, are resolved into the native elements which, after hovering hi cloudland, fall either in rain, or hail, or snow, in torrents on the steaming plains of Bengal, or in chilly blasts on the frozen cliffs of Greenland. But the materials with which Nature works, seemingly so diversified, actually so few, are never at peace. They know neither haste nor rest. They are ever in circulation. No sooner have they served one purpose than they are called upon to appear in another role. A lake is fresh simply because its waters are constantly changing. But had it no outlet, like the Dead Sea or the Utah Lake, it would be impregnated with the salt and other sub stances which the springs and the streams which feed it wash out of the soil, and which are not carried up with the evaporation from the surface. The sea is salt on this account. It is fed by many rivers, and has an immense evaporating surface, but of course there are no outlets. The rivers hasten to make a lake in every hollow. Yet these hollows are in many instances scooped out by the action of glaciers. However, no sooner are they filled with water than the very glaciers which excavated their basins, and the rivers which filled them conspire to turn them once more into solid land. We see this specimen of the ceaseless activity of Nature in many shapes. The \" loess,\" or the mud, held in suspension by the rivers which overflow their banks, and which is eventually deposited, forms a well-marked geological formation over a considerable section of Central Europe ; and the mud of the Arctic glaciers, which, as has been shown elsewhere* finds its representative in the ancient fossiliferous brick-clays of Scotland and other regions where in the Glacial period a similar condition of affairs obtained, is fast filling up many of the fjords into which the infra-glacier stream discharges. The Baltic is fast becoming a shallow lake. The Sea of Azof, shoaled by the sediment brought down by the rivers which flow into it, is gradually being converted into a stream ; and the Po, the Nile, and the other rivers which flow into the Mediterranean, bid fair to so extend their deltas as to constitute that sea a chain of lakes. The Mississippi and other great American * \"Arctic Papers of the Royal Geographical Society,\" pp. 1 \u2014 74 ; \" Countries of the World,\" Vol. i., pp. 52\u2014 67; Petermann's GeograpJtiacJu; Mittheilungen, October, 1870; and Quarterly Journ.

Soc, Vol. xxvii. p. 671."], [23, "7 INTRODUCTION. rivers are, on the principle of \" robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" extending the territory through which they flow for considerable distances into the Atlantic. In time these mud flats will rise above the surface, get covered with a dank vegetation and, after being for ages the home of fever and reptiles, will become the abode of man. The Rhine, it has been calculated, carries past Bonn something like 400 tons of solid matter in one hour, and in the course of a year between three and four millions. In the long ages since this wearing-down of Germany has been going on, an immense amount of land must have been eroded, and deposited into the German Ocean, where it forms the greater part of the country now known as Holland. \" The Netherlands,\" Napoleon Bonaparte asserted, in his usual dogmatic manner, \" are composed of the mud of French rivers.\" And as it is not easy to answer the master of many legions except after his own style of argument, he proceeded to annex Batavia to the Empire. During the rainy season of 122 days the mud brought down by the Ganges passing Ghazeepoor, 500 miles from its mouth, is reckoned at over 339,413,700 tons ; and now plague-haunted islands, formed in its channel even within the memory of man, are the result. The deltas of the Yolga, the Danube, and many other rivers, might be adduced in proof of the same trait, were not these remarks intended merely as the introduction to a subject which will be more fully discussed in the chapters which follow. But before leaving it, the familiar example of the Rhone may be cited as a striking instance of this ceaseless, this unwearying interchange of matter \u2014 of the vitality, as it were, of this mis named \" stable \" land. The Rhone, charged with glacial mud, enters Lake Geneva turbid, but issues from it clear ; the whole of the detrital tribute which it has received from the mudd}7 stream of the Alps having been deposited in the lake, where it has already aided in the formation of an alluvial plain five or six miles long. Port Yalais, which eight centuries ago was actually a port, is now one mile and a half distant from the water's edge. And here a very curious fact, which has only lately come to light, may be mentioned in illustration of this same subject. Some time ago Herr Hoernlimann, engineer to the Swiss Federal Topographical Bureau, came to the con clusion that the channel of the Rhine goes through Lake Constance and under its waters \u2014 in other words, that the river has cut itself a bed in the floor of the lake, which is continued to its lowest depths. A similar condition of affairs has been found to prevail in the Lake of Geneva, or Lake Leman, as it is often called. The river runs in an actual ravine, having parallel banks, like the bed of an overground stream, this ravine having been scooped out by the force of the current entering or passing throuo'h the lake. However, as we have seen, Nature is jealous of any one of her forces acting for an hour alone. The balance must be kept true by the antagonism of her forces, the one which tears down a made land in order to make a new one, being, as soon as its work is complete, met by another, which begins the labour anew. The volcano, the slow, \" secular rise,\" and the coral polyp have elevated an island, or a section of country, above the surface of the waves. But it has no sooner appeared in the supra-aqueous world, than the sea begins to attack it, and toss its materials hither and thither, forming out of a solid peninsula strings of islands or an archipelago of mud flats, such as are witnessed"], [24, "8 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. in the Frisian Islands and Holland* We also see this in the way mountains arc formed. It is quite incorrect to apply the term \" old \" to \" the hills.\" In a geological sense many of them are infinitely newer than the plains, and the physical geographer is well aware that they are anything but \" everlasting.\" They are, in fact, the offspring of rivers which cut up plains into elevated plateaux, of rains which crumble the plateaux into peaks, and of volcanoes and volcanic action which toss up into gigantic mounds the materials which the rivers have for ages been bringing down to the sea, and which the earthquake and the slow, \" secular rise \" have elevated from the bottom of the ocean or the lake. In a comparatively rainless region, such as that through which the Colorado flows, this eroding action of a river has all its own way. Without its work being neutralised by the play of the rain on the surface washing down the banks, the current wears down its bed, eating deeper and deeper into the soil, earth and rocks alike, until, as in the now well-known canons of the Colorado and its tributaries, the river flows at the bottom of a cleft more than a mile below the level of the surrounding country (Fig. 3). Yet the winds do not always bring rain and fertdity. They may not bear on their blasts those children of the plain and the sea which we know as the clouds, or the clouds may sail over the parched land without bestowing on it the moisture of which they are composed. Not unfrequently they bring desolation in their track if they act on a sand stone surface, where the rain falls too seldom to stimulate a vegetation sufficient to make a mould. To this cause is due the dismal desert between Morocco and Timbuctoo ; and iii the former country the writer has observed the same defective combination of wind and rain acting in an equally unfortunate fashion. It is quite a mistake to suppose that the Sahara is the old dried-up basin of the sea. In reality many parts of it are uplands, much above the level of the Atlantic or the Mediterranean. It is a sandstone formation disintegrated, as Dr. Lenz has shown, by atmospheric influences. Much the same effects are seen when the soil is recklessly denuded of wood. The rainfall, instead of sinking into the ground to appear in the form of springs, runs off the surface, carrying with it the soil also, and covering the valleys with the debris of stones and other rubbish. The springs drying up, the rivers shrink in volume, and, as has been demonstrated re peatedly, a once fertile country becomes, subject to sudden floods at one season and at another, in parts at least, little better than a desert. Not to quote more than one instance, out of many, in the province of Choco, south of Panama, there is plenty of forest and sufficient rainfall. In Payta, where there are treeless plains, cultivation has long been extinct and, for a stretch of as much as seventeen years, not a drop of rain has fallen, and the once copious springs that watered the Tuneberg, a range of hills on the east bank of the Rhone, above Strasbourg, have failed since the peasants have hewn down the trees which formerly protected them. But vegetation on the soil reacts on the land in another manner. The disinte\u00b0Tatino forces of Nature are constantly at work, and are rendered beneficent by what may be called the conservative ones. Among the chief of these is the growth of plants. The waves attack and undermine a cliff until it tumbles down and is swept into the sea ; again the * \"Peoples of the World,\" Vol. VI., pp. 243\u2014255, and pp. 275\u2014279, where a full account of this battle between the sea and the land is given."], [25, "Fig. 3.\u2014 THE GREAT CASfON OF THE RIVER COLORADO, U.S.A.: G.200 feet deep.

In time, the devoured rocks are vomited forth by the waves in the shape of sand. If, however, this sand is not kept by a barrier of trees or other plants, or is not bound into an orderly mass by some of the long-rooted\u2014 or long-\" stoloned \" \u2014 plants which love such localities, it will blow inland, overwhelm the fertile land, and then the wind comes \u2014 owing to the absence of the antipathetic force mentioned \u2014 laden with evil to the farmer. Frederick William I. of Prussia cut down a belt of pines between Dantzig and Pillau, with the result that, within a few years, the Haff, a large lake separated from the sea by the ground on which the pines grew, was gradually choked with sand; and the channel by which Elbing communicates with the Baltic at Pillau, and with Kiinigsberg, was threatened. The land has again been planted, but the mischief is partly beyond recall; and the cost of keeping the waterway clear is a great deal more than the two hundred thousand thalers which the thrifty sovereign obtained for the timber. The people of Diiben, in the Prussian Province of Saxony, were equally unwise ; but, happily for them, they have been able to remedy the mischief they wrought. Having cleared away the forest around their town, the sands which lay to the north east began to invade the cultivated ground, until many a fair field became a waste, and the cabbage-patches got covered with the common enemy. \" Vegetables,\" writes the historian of this incident, \"grew scarce, pasture for cattle rare, and the most serious results were feared, when the forester for the districts offered to arrest the desolating invasion.\" Over sixty years have elajDsed since then. \" Now rich woods and acacias, birch and pine, wave over the sandy hills, and their fine network of rootlets holds the restless sand in its place, and compels it to quiescence. Every year the citizens of Diiben turn out with music and banners \u2014 and lager beer, of course \u2014 into their woods, and celebrate with much jubilation, and great noise, the salvation of their town.\" Some districts of Scotland have suffered even more from this forgetfulness of the ceaseless operation of the laws of Nature. In Morayshire, the entire barony of Cawbin has been covered by a wilderness of sand, which advanced steadily at the rate of from three to four, and sometimes, as happens in other regions, at the rate of sixteen feet a year. Ploughed fields, fences, cottages, a manor-house, dovecots, were all irre coverably submerged, as a Scots Act of William III. expressly mentions, \" by sand driven from sandhills ; the whole has been mainly occasioned by the pulling up of the roots of bent, juniper, and broom bushes, which did loose and break the surface and scroop of the sandhills.\" The old kirk of Forvie, in Aberdeenshire, is now a mere ruin, difficult to find amid the sandhills which have overwhelmed the parish. This catastrophe was, in part at least, effected before the year 1688 ; but probably \u2014 in spite of local traditions, which ascribe the work of destruction either to a \" curse pronounced upon it by an heiress unjustly dispossessed of her inheritance,\" or, as a zealous writer of the year 1570 affirms, because J' the folks of Forvie were papists and' grossly ioriorant \" (which latter indictment may be admitted) \u2014 \" the judgment \" is due to existing causes continually operating since the establishment of the present coast-line, namely, to the south wind acting on a loosely-bound coast. Now the scene presented is as desolate as any in the"], [27, "INTRODUCTION. 11 world. For miles the country is as barren as the moving sands of Africa. \" No trace of human habitation can be seen ; huge hills of driven sand \u2014 stretching for miles in every direction, presenting no vestiges of life or vegetation but the bent under our feet, and, it may be, a stray seagull or two over our heads \u2014 might have led us to realise the feelings of loneliness which the traveller might be supposed to experience in the vast Desert of Sahara.\" * The planting of pitch-pine might perhaps here, as in the Landes of Brittany, were the climate only warm enough, not only recover the waste for cul tivation, but render it possible to yield, in the shape of tar and turpentine, a better revenue than the crop which, in accordance with the \"maidenis malysone,\" was doomed to flourish there. Wheels within Wheels. We have seen from the brief sketch in the preceding pages how tirelessly all the forces of Nature are constantly acting ; how at scarcely any moment are the materials of the earth's crust or the organisms which live in or on it at rest ; how, in brief, matter circulates in this perfect, but, considering that the process of formation is still going on, never finished world. It has undergone and is undergoing a process of evolution. A surface is no sooner raised than it begins to be depressed. Those \"stony rocks,\" which, to use the expressive language of Linn\u00e6us, \" are not eternal, but the daughters of Time,\" are only converted into dry land for the rain, and the rivers, and the winds, and the volcanoes to reconvert into their original elements, and, out of the old materials, to construct a series of fresh strata, which are the same in character if different in composition. But we have also seen how this constant circulation is necessary for the preservation of the equilibrium ; how without disintegration there could be no soil, without soil no vegetation, without vegetation no animals which live on plants, and without herbivorous species no carnivorous ones. But when we examine the \" wheels within wheels\" of this wondrous mechanism of creation, we find that the interdepen dence of all the forces concerned in keeping up the Globe is even greater than might at first sight be imagined. What connection there is between the prosperity of the pastoral interest and the number of cats in a district might seem difficult to trace ; yet the relationship is not quite so far-fetched as the words might at first seem to indicate. One of the best known facts in botany is that many species of plants cannot be fertilised without the agency of insects. The bee or other insect flying about from flower to flower in search of food, unconsciously carries the pollen of one plant and deposits it on the stigma of another, thus imitating the physiological act without which the seeds on which the plant depends for its reproduction could not be perfected. Among these plants the red clover is one. Unless the humble-bee can reach it, no seeds will be produced, no other species being able to get at the nectar, and \u2014 as the agent in the process of fertilisation does not work for the mere good of the plant \u2014 at the pollen which it is destined to carry to the nearest clover flower it alights on. Hence, it is highly probable that, if this species * The Aberdeen Magazine for May, 1832 ; quoted by Ferguson in Scottish Geographical Magazine, 1S86, p. 273."], [28, "12 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. of bee became extinct, the red clover would either become very rare or disappear. Now, as the principal enemy of the humble-bees is the field-mouse, which destroys their combs and nests, but which is itself preyed upon by cats, it is not straining bio-logic to assert, as did Mr. Darwin, that the presence of this quadruped in large numbers determines, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of clover flowers in any particular district. Near villages and towns, the nests of humble-bees are more numerous than elsewhere, owing to the number of cats that destroy the mice. Hence it is fairly deducible from the facts mentioned that the pastoral interests, and infer entially those of man, are largely dependent, first on bees, then on mice, and, last of all, on cats \u2014 possibly, we might add, on single ladies with an affection for these feline pets. Until the proper species of bee was introduced into New Zealand the cultivation of clover was found impossible. Elaborate contrivances are noticed in flowers to prevent Fig. 4.\u2014 FERTILISATION OP PLANTS : THE MEADOW SAGE (Salvia pmtennus). !, Bide view of flower 2 The same cut down longitudinally ; a, the calyx or flower-cup ; b, the curved upper lip \u2022 c the under Un which acts as a platform for the bee to stand on while sucking the nectar ; d, the young pistil topped t.y its stigSa ; <\u00a3 the pistil at a later stage: e, stamen in its normal position ; e', stamen with its anther, .shedding its pollen on the back of a Sy-bee'tfL?\u2122 : tortoromV f, position ol the prohosciS of the bee searching for honey.

In the meadow sage (Fig. 4) we see, for example, the anthers ripened long before the stigma, so that^elf-ffertilisation is impossible. However, the stamens which at first are high up in the upper lip curve down when they are ripe, so that a bee entering must catch some of the pollen on its back, and then carry it to a flower, where the pistil with its stigma, as it gets ready to receive it, also curves do\u2122, and therefore must necessarily come in contact with the pollen-dusted back of the bee. In other plants there are equally remarkable arrange ments by which no insect can get at the nectar which cannot repay its meal \"by aiding in this cross-fertilisation (Fig. 5). In passing from the tropics to the temperate regions, we observe a fallina-off in the number of native plants, owing to the disappearance of those animals necessary for their fertilisation\u2014 insects and humming-birds, for example.

The greater number of Silene\u0153, and especially the night-flowering species of Catchfly (Lychnis) and Cam pion (Silene), find their limits where the nocturnal moths cease. In the Arctic Zone those plants only can be found which are fertilised by the agency of the bee order (Hymenoptera), and the order of two-winged insects (Diptera), or the wind. This law is illustrated by the flora ot Novai Semlai, lying between lats. 76\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 N. Out of Fig-. 5. \u2014 DEFENCES OF PLOWEBS AGAINST UNWELCOME GUESTS.

The inference is therefore drawn that, notwithstanding the severity of the climate (the mean temperature of August, the hottest month of the year, not rising above 41\u00b0 Fahr.), some insects of this class must make these islands their home. One, indeed, is known to exist there. In neither Spitzbergen nor Novai Semlai are there any plants dependent on the butterfly and moth order (Lepidoptera) for their fertilisation, though many which are dependent for their multiplication on other species of insects.* It is therefore clear that, as man is dependent for his food either upon plants or upon animals which feed on them, his range and the nature of his culture must largely depend upon the existence of particular insects, which insects, again, are limited less by the conditions of climate than by the absence of the plants on which they subsist, for there is nothing in the climatic vicissitudes of Spitzbergen to admit of various species found there flourishing on its barren soil in preference to others which are so markedly absent. But, even were it otherwise, the fact would equally illustrate the interdependence of Nature, or, as we have described it in homely phrase, of the \"wheels within wheels\" which exist in every part of the machine. The currents in the sea, on which depends to so great a degree the comfort of many creatures, and which, next to the winds, are the factors that have aided commerce to take the course which it has taken, are also dependent on the heat of the sun, if We accept the theory usually associated with Dr. Carpenter's name, or, indeed, several other theories of a different school of physics, with the soundness of which we need not for the present concern ourselves. The tropical waters, heated by the blazing sun overhead, expand and rise, while the chilled waters of the North contract and sink. This sets up a steady flow of the equatorial waters north and south to reproduce the surface equilibrium. \" But,\" to use the words of Mr. Charles Morris, \" in consequence of this movement, the downward pressure of the ocean waters in the polar regions becomes in excess of that at the equator, and a reverse flow takes place along the bottom to restore the equilibrium of pressure. Thus, through the differential action of the solar heat, there is a steady vertical circulation both in the atmosphere and the ocean. That of the latter is not sufficiently vigorous to indicate itself by a decided surface flow, but its presence has been recently proved by deep-sea thermometrical observations widely extended over the oceans. To it is undoubtedly due much of that special warming of the western coasts of the continents, which was formerly ascribed to the influence of the Gulf Stream and other great surface currents.\" The surface currents \u2014 the \"rivers of the ocean,\" as they have not inaptl)7 been termed \u2014 are due to various causes, with which this is not the place to concern ourselves, but it is now very generally held that the equatorial currents owe their set to the trade winds, whose \" steady push \" on the surface of the tropical waters keeps them in continuous motion westerly round the world. How long it took before the inertia of the water was * Trautvetter's \"Conspectus Flor\u00e6 insularum Nowaja-Semlja \" in Trudrei Imperatorsltagi S.

According to an ingenious German physicist, \u2014 Dr. ZiJppritz \u2014 thousands of years must have elapsed. But these currents of the ocean, though thus possibly due to. the currents of the air, are influenced in their direction and consequences by the masses of land which they encounter. If the currents, produced by the trade winds did not encounter land in the tropical zone they would flow round the earth in this zone, without any deflection north or south; but owing to the Northern hemisphere having the greatest amount of land masses, and the southern hemisphere the greatest amount of water, the result is that the trade winds, and with them the currents, are deflected towards the North, owing to the corresponding difference of the heat distribution. It is, however, to the merest tyro in geography a popular delusion to imagine that the \" winds blow whither they list.\" A hundred proverbs have consecrated this error, and from Lapland to New Zealand \"a boy's will is the wind's will.\" In truth, no class of atmospheric phenomena are more under the influence of circumstances over which they can exercise no control. In the North, according to the changeableness of its tempera ture, the winds are seemingly irregular ; in the Tropics they are to be reckoned on with the utmost confidence, and are subject to much the same laws as the sea's surface, which they deflect into rivers circling over the ocean. In many respects it will be found, when we come to consider their cause and operation, they follow much the same laws as do the marine currents. In the Tropics the air expands, and rises and flows towards the poles in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, descends to the surface in the temperate zones, \" and thence partly returning to the equator, partly continues to flow towards the poles. These air currents, deflected by the rotating movement of the Earth, become the easterly trade winds in the Tropics, and the westerly anti-trade-winds in the North and South temperate zones. They are greatly disturbed, particularly in the Northern hemi sphere, by the influences of the land surface, which acts to produce monsoons, or steady winds, to and from the centre of the continents. In the Southern hemisphere they are more persistent, and particularly in the South temperate zone, where a broad expanse of ocean permits the westerly winds to blow steadily and strongly throughout the year.\" In the very depths of the ocean, contrary to the belief which was at one time enter tained, the influence of the sun is in its way as great as on dry land. Life exists at the depth of at least five miles, and the ofttimes gay colours of the animals brought up from the fathomed \" caves of ocean \" prove that some ray of the sun must have reached them. Again, the making of some men's homes is directly dependent on the temperature of the ocean. The coral polyp \u2014 which rears so many of the Polynesian Islands by a slow system of adding patch after patch of lime, eliminated from the water in which it lives to the tube in which it is housed \u2014 is strictly limited to certain depths. It cannot live very far below the surface, nor, we shall see, can it exist when the warmth of the sun reaches a certain specified heat. Yet the circulation of matter does not stop here. Hot springs \u2014 that is to say, the rainfall which has sunk into the soil, and come in contact with the hot places in the interior of the globe \u2014 worm their way through the bowels of the earth, dissolving out whatever is soluble and then discharging it on the surface, where, after cooling,"], [32, "16 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. it forms vast masses of flinty and other materials of the crust, such as those which we find in the Yellowstone country in North America, and in the Lake District of New Zealand (Fig. 6). The latter region, which is situated in the old Province of Auckland, was\u2014 and is still\u2014 one of the most remarkable \"show places\" of the Northern Island of New Zealand. The \" Hot Lake District \" is a land of geysers, boiling mud baths, and sulphur springs of such efficacy in rheumatic and cutaneous diseases that it is commonly regarded as the Bethesda of the Antipodes. But of all the marvellous spots in this wonder-land of the South, the pink and white terraces of Roto mahana were the most extraordinary. These beautiful objects consisted of a graduated series of basins lined with flinty matter, smooth as polished marble, and formed in the course of ages by the silicious solution deposited from the Rotomahana hot springs. They were arranged in the fashion of steps, and the water flowed in a perpetual cascade from one to the other, gradually cooling in the course of the descent. The result was a series of natural baths, with the water ranging in temperature from lukewarm in the .bottom basin to boiling-point in the one where it took its rise. The basins were filled with exquisitely blue water, and edged with a delicate fringe of sparkling stalactites, the whole forming an effect of Nature quite unique, and lovely beyond the power of pen to describe or pencil to portray. The entire country for a distance of 120 miles from north to south, and about twenty in breadth, is hot and crumbling, and at places the crust is so thin that unless the pedestrian treads warily he will get immersed in boiling mud. But though volcanic eruptions had not been infrequent, it was the general opinion of geologists, up to the 10th of June, 188G, that the Lake District was the scene of waning volcanic energy and that as time rolled on its activity would grow less and less, until at length even its geysers would become things of the past. But on the day in question the world was rudely undeceived. About midnight, after a succession of earthquakes, Mount Tarawera, a dormant volcano, burst into violent activity, and was followed by the entire Paeroa Range, including even Ruapehu, which had been extinct from a period beyond which the legends of tradition extended not. This catastrophe we shall describe more fully when we come to consider volcanoes and their phenomena. But what immediately con cerns us as physical geographers is, that amid the havoc which ensued, and the lives which were lost, the pink and white terraces of Rotomahana disappeared, destroyed by the forces which in their quieter moods had reared them, though doubtless, in the ceaseless changes which are for ever going on, the silicious springs will continue dissolving out the flinty matter, bringing it to the surface, and again depositing it in pearly cascades, more lovely, perhaps, than those which are now only a memory of the past. However, as if to demonstrate that every particle of matter is undergoing a constant revolution, Ave learn in a private letter from the shaken district that, in less than a fortnight after the volcanic showers had ceased, the sorely-tried earth hastened to seek what advantage it could in the cataclysm. A deluge of rain speedily washed away almost all traces of the volcanic dust which was deposited in the neighbourhood, and did much good. \" There is no doubt whatever that the dust contains (as most volcanic soil does) valuable ferti lising properties. It has been found by analysis that it holds about three-tenths per cent. of potash, lime, and soda, and the quantity deposited here having been about sixty tons"], [33, "Fig. 6.-THE ROTOMAHANA TERRACES AND HOT SPRINGS, NEW ZEALAND. Destroyed by an Eruption ox June 10, 1886. i..lsier a Photograph.) n"], [34, "18 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. per acre, it follows that the land has received a top dressing of about three and a half hundredweights of the above valuable constituents, and there is nothing deleterious in the remainder. Indeed, it does not require the analyst to convince one of the benefit the land has derived, as one can see it by the wonderful growth of the grass and clover, and other more delicate plants, even in an exceptionally cold season. Of course, there has been great loss by moving and feeding stock while the pasture was covered by the dust, but in my opinion and that of practical farmers here a great permanent benefit has accrued to all the land in the district, excepting, of course, that in the immediate neighbourhood of the eruptions, where the country is hopelessly buried in mud and dust.\" Thus the circulation of matter is incessant. The sun is, therefore \u2014 apart from the influence which it exercises as the controller of the \" solar system,\" \u2014 the ruler and the life-giver of the universe, the provider of the rain and the wind and the warmth, and all that rain and wind and warmth can supply. Hence, from the physical geographer's point of view, there is more in astrology than the puerilities of the astrologers ever imagined. When Cassius declares that \" the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings,\" he gives forth a sound protest against the jargon of the soothsayers, who cast horoscopes and determined the fate of man by the \" conjunction \" of the planets. But meteor ologists, and a great many people who are not meteorologists, know how a bright sky or an east wind affects their mental and material constitution, and thereby their daily life, or it may be their future career. The cold of the North does not chill the heart, but the torrid sun of the South imparts a pepperiness, almost a ferocity, to the hot blood of these regions. On a cold day a man feels better disposed towards the world in general than on a hot one, and the irritability produced by the hot wind which at times sweeps over the plains of La Mancha and Andalusia is so little pro vocative of kindly feelings that no proverb is more frequently heard in Cadiz or Seville than \" Ask no favour during the Solano.\" The mental and physical robustness felt in a temperate climate is of course familiar to every one in contradistinction to the lassitude which sooner or later creeps over every resident in warm countries, where during the heat of the day a siesta becomes so imperative that in one of the revolts in Madrid, insurgents and troops alike, by a well-understood arrangement, abated hostilities for a couple of hours, near the dinner-hour, and resumed the offensive as soon as the period of quiescence had passed. The vigour of the Northern nations, their enterprise and their versatility, are in no small degree due to the vicissitudes of their climate. The man who never knows what to-morrow may bring forth requires to be far-seeing, energetic, and provident. But the toiler who is certain that when the rain stops there will be \"none to speak of\" for the next four months, is apt to grow indifferent, to take the world too easily, and to spare himself needless thought for the future, until his sluggish brain refuses to act when there is most need of its being ready for work. On the other hand, the people of a land subject to the terrible disasters of earthquakes, tornadoes, and volcanic eruptions, are likely to become nerveless, and in time to get impregnated with that hopeless fatalism which is embodied in the ada.o-e anent \" what must be, will be,\" or which is the antipodes of that cheerful philosophy"], [35, "INTRODUCTION. 19 regarding Providence helping those who help themselves. Buckle, indeed, amid many other generalisations \u2014 which if not vero were at least ben trovato \u2014 attributed much of the superstition which envelops the Spaniards, Italians, and Portuguese, to the physical horrors amid which they and their ancestors live and have lived. The imagination is strong in their lands, but the reasoning faculty is weak. Science scarcely asserts itself, and the philosophers of the Peninsula have never exercised much influence over European thought or progress.* It is, therefore, quite within the limits of truth to affirm that in some respects the planets and the atmospheric and terrestrial environ ments of man re-act on his physical, mental, and moral character. Man and His Surroundings. But the distribution of man is dependent upon the distributions of the animals and plants on which he subsists ; so that he, like the rest of creation, is intimately bound up with heat and light, the winds and the rain, and therefore with the \" stars that move in their courses.\" He is also, to some degree, a creature of the ocean currents. Islands have before now been peopled by wandering canoemen, who have been carried by the currents out of their courses ; and the Japanese junks which have at different times been wrecked on the north-west coast of America would go far to explain how that continent might have been peopled, were not the hypothesis of its having obtained the original stock from whom the present race of \" Indians \" are sprung, from Asia, by way of the comparatively narrow Behring Strait, still more easily accepted. Again, were it not for the currents conveying fruits and trees \u2014 in the roots of which seeds and, it may be, dormant land molluscs and the eggs of other animals are buried \u2014 many coral islands now thickly peopled would have remained lifeless, uninhabited, and unfitted for the abode of man. The influence of certain species of plants, and inferentially the character of certain regions, on civilisation, has been often discussed, and, before we have finished our task, may be rehearsed once more. For example, the dense forests of Brazil have not admitted of the savages who roam through its jungles or paddle along its vast rivers ever rising much out of the rudest hunter stage of existence. But in the cool uplands of Peru and Mexico, in a region fitted for the growth of the beneficent maize, a comparatively high grade of civilisation was attained. The dense forests of the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, and particularly of the region between the Pacific and the Cascade Range, with endless facilities for obtaining abundant supplies of food in the rivers and other waters, have been equally unpropitious to advancement in culture, most of the tribes inhabiting the region being in the rudest state of savagedom, though not unskilful in the fabrication of their fishing implements and, in the case of the Hydahs of Queen Charlotte Islands and the neighbouring mainland, endowed with a considerable amount * This theory is ingeniously worked out, as all Buckle's ideas are. without much regard to the influences of race on mental traits, in the \"History of Civilisation in England,\" Vol. I.

In the region formed by the wide prairies of Central North America the buffalo hunters are\u2014 or were, for the bison has all but vanished\u2014 little better, so far as civilisation is concerned ; though, requiring to exercise their limbs more freely in order to obtain food, they are as a rule of finer build, though, if possible, of worse morals. But when the Europeans first reached Eastern America, they found the tribes there, though barbarian, not without the germs of a higher life. For they were stationary ; they were therefore imbued with the love of country ; and having for ages cultivated the maize, they had experienced the humanising influences of agriculture ; and therefore, if ruthless to their foes, capable on occasions\u2014 unless all history be lies\u2014 of acts of great magnanimity to the whites, who did not always deserve much consideration at their hands. The people of the Southern Continent, owing to their isolation from those of the other parts of the world, have been noted as more deficient in culture than those of the North, who, from their geographical position, are better able to communicate with each other, and profit by whatever race has to teach to race. That the physical configuration of countries has changed or controlled the course of history is familiar to the least observant. England and the English owe many of their salient characteristics to their insular position ; while the geological features of their island have impressed the people of particular districts with features likely to be more lasting than the rapidly-vanishing traits of race. Mr. Freeman has shown how Europe, the continent most abounding in peninsulas, is occupied by nations, which in their turn \u2014 Greeks, Romans, Spaniards, Portuguese, Scandinavians, and, if we regard the British Islands as a dissevered peninsula of France, English \u2014 have been important agents in the civilisation and colonisation of the rest of the world. Then, after the ancient empires had fallen in pieces, Germany, from its central position, exer-' cised a similar controlling influence, though, being an inland country, it has not at any time been a colonising power; and though vast numbers of Germans leave their country for other lands, there is little likelihood of the course of history being reversed by the recent feeble efforts in that direction. The peninsulas, moreover, being cut off in a marked manner from the rest of Europe, developed a civilisation in each case pecu liarly their own. \" No doubt,\" the eminent historian mentioned remarked, \" the history of each country has been largely influenced by the disposition of the people who settled in it, and by what is called national character.\" But then the geographical position itself has influenced the disposition of a race which claims such a region for its home, by giving it a better or a worse field for working it out. Thus, as has been well said, neither the Greeks in any other country, nor any other people in Greece, could have been what the Greeks in Greece really were. \" The nature of the country, and the nature of the people, helped one another, and caused Greece to become all that it was in the early times of Europe.\" It is a matter of familiar observation that a people nurtured in a flat land, if not more heroic \u2014 the Dutch are in proof \u2014 than the inhabitants of mountains, are more prosaic, in brief, more in keeping with their surroundings ; though, again, as mountains are invariably the refuge of a race too proud to submit to the conqueror's yoke, or too weak to resist him, the rule may work conversely. The stronger tribes in any"], [37, "INTRODUCTION. 21 country are always found to occupy the sea-coast or the plains. This we see in the Papuan Islands, which the Malays have taken possession of; and in Morocco and Algeria, the Berbers, the original inhabitants of the country, inhabit the uplands, while the conquering Arabs roam in the plains below. The pure Celts of England keep their ancient tongue among the hills of Wales ; and their brethren have in Scot land been driven up from the flat plains of the south to the highlands of the north. Again, the Swiss are the French, German, and Italian peoples who have made it con venient to escape the despotism of powerful sovereigns by taking refuge in the more inaccessible Alpine valleys. A slight study of the distribution of races in Switzerland, with a map of the mountains before us, brings out very clearly some of the facts we have been trying to inculcate, as to the influence of physical features upon settle ment and civilisation. Northern races, that is to say, the Germans and Celts, occupy the north ; and the southern, or Latin-speaking, people, that is the Italian and French stocks, in like manner hold nearly all of the South. But when we examine the Rhone valley, we find that up to Sion it is Celtic ; at Sierre it is mixed ; and higher up the stream it is wholly Teutonic. The valley of the Rhone is long and narrow. Beyond the passage of the Villeneuve, France has only passage into it \u2014 \" the high and lateral entry \" from Chamounix \u2014 by the Forclaz. Through these two gorges the Gauls from Burgundy and Savoy poured into the Valais ; but in pouring up the river they were met in front and taken on the 'flank by Teutons coming by the Furka pass from Andermatt, by the Grimsel pass from Meyringen, by the Gemmi pass from Unterseen, by the Col du Rawyl from Thun, and by the Sanetsch pass from Gsteig and Saanen. Faced by their rivals they retired on Sion, and there have ever since held the ground. Again, taking the Rhine up to Chur, the river is German ; in Ilanz it is mixed ; and higher up the stream is Rh\u00e6to-Romance. The reason is that, though Nature has given the Teuton five inlets to the Rhone, it has denied him access to a river which he considers peculiarly his own. From Ober Alp to Trons in the Fore Rhine valley there is not a track whereby even a chamois could cross the northern heights. From Trons and Flims there are two narrow paths ; near Ilanz an opening enables the Panix to be reached, though both paths are hard to climb ; while, on the southern bank, a dozen easy roads make access to the Italian valleys easy. Thus, \" a counter march to what has given the upper waters of the Rhone to naen of northern race, has given the upper waters of the Rhine to men of southern race. A Teutonic colony has pushed towards Italy ; and if they have not crossed the ridge, their colonists hold the mountains to the top. They hold the hamlets of the Rheinwald and the pastures of Averserthal. Some German thorps are circled by a foreign population, like Germ an colonies in Russia. One such thorp is that of Bosco, in Ticino. St. Martin and Ober saxen are Teutonic thorps.\"* Geographical features have, therefore, an important influence on civilisation. They check or expedite settlement. Industries are necessarily dependent on the soil and the * Dixon : \" The Switzers,\" pp. 59-61 ; \" Peoples of the World,\" Vol. V., p. 318, and Vol. VI., pp, 126-128, 138-139."], [38, "22 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. climate, and the character of every people is more or less influenced by the craft which they follow. In this way, a geological formation, or a mountain ridge, or the fact ot a river being- a little swifter or a little deeper, being unpicturesquely smooth or impeded by cataracts and falls, may turn the march of armies and mould the course of history. But, if man has been curbed by his inanimate surroundings, he, as the most powerful of all organised beings, and, in individuals, perhaps the most numerous of the higher animals, is rapidly reversing the process. He has changed the entire aspect of vast continents ; he has hewn down primeval forests and converted their sites into corn-fields. To graze his flocks and herds he has exterminated the wild animals which from time immemorial pastured the prairies ; and, in several instances, in order to gratify his appetite, he has decreed or is decreeing the death of several gigantic mammals and large birds, which until he burst in upon their haunts, were plentiful. Within less than a century, man has drained lakes and joined seas; in the course of his history he has turned gardens into deserts, and made the desert bloom with verdure ; he has covered the sites of wigwams with great cities ; and again, by his ferocity, has so thoroughly erased what were for ages the wonders of Pagandom, that it is all but impossible for Christendom to trace the places where once upon a time teeming towns had for ages hummed with life. We thus see that every part of Nature is connected with every other part ; that it is impossible to detach any portion without marring what remains ; and that therefore it is difficult to gain anything like a satisfactory view of this marvellous harmony if little detached sections are chosen for study. We may not be able to probe it very deeply or to analyse it exhaustively, but it is necessary to take it as a whole. We have also seen that the earth is, almost without hyperbole, a sentient being. Everything is more or less in motion. Nothing is lost, yet nothing is ever at a standstill. Even the minute shells \u2014 so minute that>, without the aid of a microscope, they cannot be seen \u2014 which absorb the dissolved lime from the sea- water fall to the bottom after the frail specks of living jelly to which they afforded a home have run their course, and are utilised by thrifty Nature to make chalk ; while the decomposition of the shells of fresh-water molluscs gradually accumulates marl beds, which, spread upon the soil, impart fertility to the impoverished earth, and thus indirectly help to feed man and beast. This continual movement of the winds and waves, this w-earing down and raising up, this vomiting forth of volcanic matter, this disruption of the solid rocks by sudden shocks, has been going on from the beginning of time. In the earth's crust we have ample proofs of this constancy of the forces of Nature. The rocks, indeed, contain almost no record which cannot be duplicated hi modern times. No new laws have been called into action. The remains of the plants and the animals which they contain are different, in the vast majority of instances, from those now living on the earth ; but it will be our business to learn, before we go very far on our road together, that these \" fossil \" forms are modelled on the same plan as the \" recent \" ones, and that in not a few cases regions which are in our day characterised by some peculiar faunas were, in the later geological ages, characterised by larger types of the same birds and mammals. The laws of Nature have been eternal, though their operations have been tardy. But, if the \" mills of God grind slowly,\" they \"grind exceeding small\""], [39, "23 CHAPTER I. Land and Water : their Proportions and Relations.

At a later stage of our studies we shall have occasion to investigate the data from which the shape of the Earth has been ascertained. Meanwhile, before entering on the discussion of a point so abstruse, it is more instructive to examine facts which lie more patent to our observation. However, even at this early period it may be well to remind the reader that the so-called globe is really a sphere, flat tened at each end, and measuring, if a hole could be bored from the North to the South Pole, 7,899114 miles, and from one side of the equator to the other 7,925604 miles. Even then the sphere is not quite symmetrical, the equatorial circumference being an \" ellipse \" instead of a circle, so that the greatest axis of the equator lies in a meridian which, if exten ded, would pass through Ireland, Portugal, and the north-west corner of Africa, and cutting off the north-east corner of Asia in the oppo site hemisphere.* But of this lithosphere, or stony crust of the earth, about one-third part is composed of hard or rocky masses, in contradistinction to the gaseous atmospheric, or liquid portion, sometimes known as the hydrosphere. This hard portion is sus pended in an atmosphere of air and of water externally, and is internally \u2014 wholly or in part \u25a0 \u2014 a fiery mass, the covering of which we term the crust of the earth. It is impossible to define with much exactitude the density of this lithosphere. We can merely ascertain the approximate character of the projecting rocks ; and even then it is seldom that we can examine them in their greatest depths. However, judging from the data thus ascer tained, the density^ of the earth's crust is about two and a half times that of water, while the mean density is more than twice as great, or about five and a half times that of water. A glance at a map will show that only a proportionately small part of the litho sphere rises into elevated masses. Traversing, as it were, more or less extensive masses of water, the different portions of the land which appear above the surface are connected by small isthmuses or necks of land. The largest of these land masses are termed continents, and the waters which divide them seas. The con tinents represent the elevated and the seas the depressed parts of the earth's crust. These variations of level are, in all probability, due to a contraction of the crust in consequence of the diminution of heat at the centre of the earth, or of the cooling of the globe from a condition of high temperature. The present form and size of the continents and seas are not primeval. They have been gradually evolved, and, as we have already seen (pp. 7, 8), the shape of the earth is still being more or less affected by forces which have been in action from time immemorial. These succes sive and manifold changes, and the action of different geological agencies, have greatly transformed the contour of the continents. It is thus clear that, as the surface of the Earth is undergoing a gradual process of change, our most trustworthy maps can only be regarded by the geologist as presenting to us a picture of the world which is destined to become un true in course of time. Indeed, so constant are the alterations which the surface is undergoing, that, even were it possible to have an exact model of the earth instantaneously constructed, it would, were not the forces of Nature sud denly brought to a standstill, be more or less false within the next hour. * Clarke ; Philosophical Magazine, August, 187S."], [40, "24 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. nents and islands, with the partially unex plored North and South Polar regions, are taken as occupying 39,534,448 square miles ; this leaves a space of 108,692,782 square miles for the seas. Thus the proportion of land to sea is as 1 to 27 ; or if the surface of the earth is taken as 1, then the land covers 0266 and the sea 0734 part of the globe. In other words, about three-quarters of the surface of the world are occupied by ocean, and little Relations of Land and Water. Modern exploration has curbed the imagi nation. With the exception of a considerable expanse in the Polar basins, very little of the world is now unknown, so far at least as its outlines are concerned. Accordingly, though it will be long before the contour of the sur face is perfectly portrayed, we are enabled to arrive at some approximate idea regarding the Fig. 7. \u2014 DIAGRAM SHOWING DIVERGENCE OP LAND MASSES AND ZONE OP CLEAVAGE OP THE EARTH. size of the seas and the territories which, as it were, are immersed in them. According to the last estimates, the area of the entire globe is 148,227,230 square miles* If the conti- more than a quarter is above the water; or if we take the entire superficial area of the globe \u2014 as Kriimmel and Wagner have done \u2014 at 197 millions of square statute miles; 145 millions of these are covered' by sea, and only 52 millions occupied by lands The land and the water are, however, very unequally distributed.

In ordinary parlance \u2014 and hence in most English works on political geography \u2014 the area of coun tries is usually given in English \u2022 statute miles, which makes the amount appear considerably larger. Thus, while Holland contains 613 German square miles, or 10.288 geographical miles, in the school text-books it is credited with 13,670 statute miles. But in a work on physical geography it is essential, when dealing with scientific details, to employ a uniform scientific measurement. t The exact figures are 144,386,354 square statute miles of water, and 53,517,373 square miles of land. But as Penck shows, the estimate is made on the basis that the Polar regions are altogether composed of water, and that in reality the amount of land and sea is, owing to various circumstances, variable. The figures given must, there fore, be taken as only approximate {-.Vitthcilinigen der K. K.

In addition to these five continents, there are the unexplored North and South Polar regions, so that, if a liberal estimate of the amount of land in these hitherto inaccessible regions is made, the entire area of the continents may be put down at 39,534,448 square miles. Southern, hemisphere. In the Northern part of the world the surface of the land is 0'40, while in the Southern portion it amounts to only 013. The latter has, therefore, scarcely one-third as much as the first, and its surface of water is in' proportion to that in the North as 10 to 7. If, therefore, we were to divide the Earth into two hemispheres, one composed of the greatest amount of land, and the other of the greatest amount of water, we must make the division, not perpendicularly to its axis of rotation, but perpendicularly to a radius which traverses the western part of the British Channel. The North-Eastern hemisphere is here opposite the South-Western hemisphere ; London and Paris would fall about the centre of the first, and the antipodean islands of New Zealand would form the central lands of the other. Thus one of these hemispheres is there fore a vast area of lands ; the other an equally extensive expanse of waters. These facts were not readily accepted. For a long time it was regarded as certain that if the North was covered with continents, the South must be equally well provided, otherwise the balance would not be kept true. When New Zealand was discovered it was considered to give a basis for this belief. But when Cook returned from his great voyages, without finding any such Southern continent, the theory had to be abandoned and, as the amount of land which can lie within the wall of ice which bars the way to the South Pole (Fig. 8) must be very limited, is never likely to be revived. The masses of land might also be considered as two large continents : an eastern, includ ing Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, and a western, composed of North and South America ; or three double continents : Austral- Asia (because Australia is nearly united with India through the East Indian Archipelagos), Europe- Africa, and North and South America. These three pairs appear, so far as the northern halves of the two eastern pairs are concerned, subdivided in the sam.e way by seas. Asia and Europe, moreover, forming really one con tinent \u2014 the latter being a peninsula of the former \u2014 might be termed Eurasia. Otherwise Europe and Asia have natural border zones in their great inland salt seas \u2014 the Caspian and the sea of Aral. These sheets of water, also. indicate extensive continental depressions, the surface of the Caspian tying 84 feet \\ below that of the Black Sea, which may be re garded as not differing much from the ave rage oceanic level. In these estimates the character of the Polar Regions has been little more than guessed at ; especially is this true of the Antarctic Basin. But every fact is in favour of the belief that there is a very large mass of land at the South Pole. The Seas. \u2014 Just as we have five continents, so we have five oceans, which are in communi cation with each other : \u2014 \u00a7 The Pacific Ocean 46,819,360 square miles, The Atlantic Ocean ...23,165,120 \u201e \u201e The Indian Ocean ... ... 21,306,800 \u201e The Antarctic Ocean ... 5,950,368 \u201e The Arctic Ocean 4,443,616 \u201e 101,685,264 \u201e The Continents. \u2014 It is customary, more for convenience of description than for any other sounder reason, to designate five continents.

To these may be added the smaller seas of the more territorial type, such as the Mediterra nean, the Baltic, the Gulf of Mexico, the sea around the Bahamas, the Caribbean Sea, the Austral- Asiatic, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea, which conjointly amount to 4,887,216 square miles ; and what may be called the border seas* namely, the German Ocean (North Sea), the English Channel, the Irish Sea, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Japanese Sea, and the Eastern Chinese Sea, in all 2,120,302 square miles ; so that the total area of the known sea, which covers so large a portion of the earth is, in more exact figures than those which may be ac cepted when we have to roughly calculate the proportion of land to water, 108,692,782 square miles. Indeed, so extensive are the seas that the Pacific Ocean alone occupies a larger space than all the continents put together. to Africa, in their comparatively unbroken coast-line. Francis Bacon was the first writer who remarked that the southern extremities of the two worlds terminate in narrow points turned towards the Southern Ocean, while their northern portion widens out so unex pectedly that the early navigators, reasoning from the analogy presented by Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope, were grievously disappointed when they failed to double the North by means of the supposed North-east and North-west Passages, as easily as they had done the South. But it was Reinhold Forster, who accompanied Cook on his second voyage, who expanded this observation by pointing out other analogies and coincidences, which had not until then been noticed. He called attention, for example, to the fact that the southern parts of all the continents are high and rocky, and \" seem to be the ex tremities of mountain belts, which come from the interior and break off abruptly without transition at the shore of the ocean. Thus America, which terminates in the rocky precipice of Cape Horn, the last representa tive of the already broken chain of the Andes ; thus Africa at the Cape of Good Hope, with its high plateau and its table-mountain, which rises from the bosom of the ocean to a height of more than 4,000 feet ; thus Asia, in the peninsula of Hindostan, sends out the Ghauts to form the high rocks of Cape Comorin ; and lastly Australia, whose southern extremity presents, at South Cape in Van Diemen's Land, the same abrupt and massive nature.\" f Again, all the continents have islands or other fragments of land east of their southern points. Thus, for example, the Falklands lie to the south-east of South America, Mada gascar and the volcanic islands in its vicinity to the south-east of Africa, the East-Indian Archipelago to the south-east of Asia, and the West Indies to the south-east of North America. To these examples might be added \u2014 Ceylon, Australia, and New Zealand, which lie more or less off the eastern extremity of Asia. A third peculiarity which Forster pointed out w7as that the continents have a Efforts have been made to define a certain law in the arrangement and grouping of the basins of the seas. A law, if such is the proper name for it, appears plainly before us in the convergence of the masses of land towards the North and their divergence towards the South. In the land hemisphere (Fig. 7) the four con tinents which appear are massive and broad towards the North, but tapering into capes, which give them a wedge-like form, towards the South. Otherwise there are wide differ ences between them. Europe and Asia are deeply indented by arms of the sea and bays, which form numerous promontories and capes, nearly all of the latter, like the great conti nents, pointing towards the South. Africa, on the other hand, is distinguished by a remarkably even coast-line ; it has not a single break in its long shore, comparable with the many in Europe and Asia. America is in its northern part not unlike Europe and Asia, in the fact that its shores are in dented by deep bays and fjords ; but South America \u2014 except in the extreme southern parts \u2014 and Australia have a general likeness * That is, they properly belong to the nearest conti nent, since a slight elevation of the bottom would convert them into dry land continuous with that which they border. f Guyot : \"The Earth and Man,\" p. 14."], [44, "28 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. i deep bend on their western side towards the interior. \" On this side their flanks are as if hollowed into a vast gulf. In America the concave summit of this inflection is indicated by the position of Arica, at the foot of the high Cordillera of Bolivia. In Africa the Gulf of Guinea expresses more strongly still this characteristic feature. It is more feebly marked in Asia by the Gulf of Cambay and the Indo-Persian Sea ; it appears fully in Pole. Between the northern and the southern continents there is a zone of cleavage visible in an east-westerly direction (Fig. 7). Inside this zone of cleavage lie the Archipelagos of the East and West Indian Islands, and the Peninsulas of Southern Asia and Europe. The Red Sea and the Mediterranean, and the Western Indian Ocean, with their bordering seas, form here almost uninterrupted water communication around the globe ; and the Fig. 9.\u2014 HELIGOLAND (EXAMPLE OP CONTINENTAL ISLAND). Australia, where the Gulf of Nuyts, or the Great Australian Bight, occupies almost the whole southern side.\" Suez Canal having been finished, it now only requires the construction of the Panama Canal to complete the circuit. The largest exten sion of the eastern continent, from west to south, is 10,350 miles\u2014 nearly three times the size of the western one. This inequality in the extent of both continents is to be sought for in the inequality of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The former has a breadth of 6,000 miles, while the latter is only 2,800 miles broad. Thus a broad and a narrow con tinent, and a wide and a narrow sea-basin, are in juxtaposition.

But before doing so we may remark that the three northern con tinents lie closely together around the North Pole, and their greatest masses come within the temperate zone. The three Southern landmarks are, on the contrary, divided by great seas; and lie therefore far apart from each, for the most part inside the torrid zone.

Forster, however, was ready to seek the cause of the southern side, and left nothing standing but their rock)7 points, which were only the skeleton. The islands on the east w7ould be only the accumulated ruins of this great catastrophe, or the fragments of the con tinent protected from total destruction by the jutting point which received the first shock.\" This theory is too sweeping, too little in accordance with the doctrines which geology holds, to be accepted in modern times.

He might observe that the great oceanic area of the Pacific and Antarctic Oceans is dotted with islands \u2014 like a shallow pool with stones rising above its sur face \u2014 as if its general depth were small in comparison with its area. He might also notice that a mass or belt of land surrounds each Pole, and that the northern ring sends off to the southward three vast tongues of land and of mountain-chains, terminating re spectively in South America, South Africa, and Australia, towards which feebler and in sular processes are given off by the Antarctic Continental mass. This, as some geographers have observed, gives a rudely three-ribbed aspect to the Earth, though two of the three ribs are crowded together and form the Europ-asian mass, or double continent, while the third is isolated in the single continent of America. He might also observe that the northern girdle is cut across, so that the Atlantic opens by a wide space into the Arctic Sea, while the Pacific is contracted towards the north, but confluent with the Antarctic Ocean. The Atlantic is also rela tively deeper and less cumbered with islands than the Pacific, which has the higher ridges near its shores, constituting what some visitors to the Pacific coast of America have not in aptly called the ' back of the world,' while the wider slopes face the narrower ocean, into which for this reason the greater part of the drainage of the land is poured. The Pacific and Atlantic \u2014 though both depressions or flattenings of the earth\u2014 are, as we shall find, different in age, character, and conditions; and the Atlantic, though the smaller, is the older, and, from the geological point of view, in some respects the more important of the two.\"* causes which are still operating on its surface. It is more to the purpose to notice, as Hum boldt pointed out, that there exists a singular parallelism between the two sides of the At lantic, north of 10\u00b0 South latitude, \" the pro jecting angle of the one corresponding to the receding angle of the other.\" Thus the Gulf of Guinea on the African shore corresponds to Cape San Roque in America, while the Gulf of Mexico is the concavity, which is matched by the convexity of that great headland of Africa, of which Cape Yerd is the extreme point. That these peculiarities are not the result of \" accident \" we may easily premise. There are no accidents in Nature. But what is the cause, or what the succession of causes, which have led to this conformation, is for the present beyond our power to fathom ; and it would only be idle speculation for us to discuss the many hypotheses which have been adduced in trying to arrive at some conclusion. It is, however, not too much to say that though Forster was beside the point in attributing the shape of the continents to vast floods, he had a glimmering of the truth. When we know how ceaselessly the sea is wearing away the land, it is impossible not to attribute \u2014 in part, at least, \u2014 the roughly tri angular shape of so many lands, namely, Greenland, Lower California, Florida, Scandi navia, Italy, Greece, India, Indo-China, the Malay Peninsula, Corea, and Kamtschatka, not to speak of Africa and America, to the ocean which laves each side. But, as we shall be fore long learn, the great continents are, in their broad outlines at least, of much older date than has been sometimes taken for granted ; and the geologists who, when a difficulty occurred, raised up and decreed the disappearance of land-ridges, where none now exist, were reckoning without the Deep-sea Sounder, who has of late years been playing so important a part in physical geography. Sir William Dawson has so admirably summed up the broad features of the two \"Teat oceans, that in closing our discussion of the subject we may quote his words verbatim. \" If we imagine,\" the eminent geologist writes, \" an observer contemplating the Earth from a * \"Presidential Address to the British Association,\" 1886."], [47, "31 THE ISLANDS. The Islands. \u2014 Various classifications of these detached masses of land have been made.* But the one most generally adopted is that which divides them into (1), Conti nental (Fig. 9), and (2), Oceanic Islands, as this expresses not only their origin, and to a certain decree their structure, but is also in accordance with what is known regarding their plant and animal life, which differs in the two groups. The first class generally lie not far from some continental mass, and do not differ from the larger sea-girt continents, except by their smaller size. They are iden tical with the former in creological structure, and are inhabited by much the same plants and animals. Thus Great Britain is only a dissevered portion of the neighbouring con tinent, and a very slight elevation in the sea bed of the ocean which separates it from the rest of Europe, would speedily unite it to the mass from which it was severed at a com paratively recent period in the history of the eflobe. The largest continental islands are : \u2014 others from the continental mass of which they formed a part, very probably dates from a much more ancient period. Ceylon, Mada gascar, and Tasmania are examples, while New Caledonia and New Zealand appear to be remnants of what were formerly large in dependent continental masses. There are, of course, also volcanic islands near continents, which are of very recent date. The Oceanic Islands are, however, of an entirely different order. They are scattered on the bosom of the ocean, and are sur rounded by very deep water, which debars the idea of supposing that any broken-down land communication ever existed there, even did not the positive testimony of the sound ing-lead leave no doubt on the subject. Some are of volcanic origin \u2014 islets vomited out of the abyss, or, more strictly speaking, the tops of submarine volcanoes, such as are still at intervals displaying their activity in the Pacific and other oceans ; others are com posed of coral, resting on the flanks of vol canoes and mountain-chains, and built up by the coral polyp eliminating from the sea the lime to form its tube. It does not, of course, necessarily follow that all volcanic islands are oceanic. Only, all oceanic islands are either volcanic or coral, or both combined. Were they anything else they would be fragments of some large submerged continent, which in no case are they. The volcanic isles off con tinents always lie in the region of active volcanoes, and sometimes, like the Kuriles and Aleutians, take the form of chains ; or, like the Sandwich, Fiji, Tahiti, and others, form groups ; or, like Iceland. Jan Mayen, Ascen sion, St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha, St. Paul, Amsterdam, fee, are isolated. The Coral Islands \u2014 the low-lying islands of the South Sea \u2014 strictly speaking, are oceanic islands, which never rise higher than from one or two, or at the utmost, three or four yards above the surface of the sea. These coral islands may also be regarded as due to accumulation ; for, as the polyp cannot come to the surface, they must be raised above the surface either by volcanic action or by the waves tossing up blocks of dead coral. Then, the birds bring New Guinea with 306,000 square miles. Borneo \u201e 286,000 \u201e Madagascar \u201e 230,000 \u201e Sumatra , 130,000 \u201e Many of these continental islands appear to be of comparatively modern date \u2014 that is, they became dissevered from the nearest con tinent within a period which geologists re gard as recent. Some have been divided from their border continents by comparatively newly-formed sea channels, like that which separates the British Islands from the Continent, and the Danish group from Germany. In like manner, the separation of Novai Semlai and Spitzbergen in the one case from Russia, and in the other either from Greenland or from the present portion of Europe \u2014 the former, more probably \u2014 cannot be doubted ; while the Mediterranean Islands are geologically \u2014 and often as regards their mountain ranges also \u2014 simply dissevered parts of the continent to which they geo graphically belong.

Coast islands, for the most part of an insignificant size, are often seen in swarms along the shores of continents or large islands. They were formed either by drift or by accumulation* like the' alluvial islands (sand and mud banks) at the mouth of large seeds, and the plants which spring from the seeds that they bring form a soil on which grows the vegetation they are covered with.

When the insu lation of a continental island has been of long duration, it not unfrequently happens that it also contains a few plants and animals dif ferent from those of the mainland, or pecu liar to itself, the modification being due to the isolation to which such forms have been exposed. This, however, is a subject which will be more fully discussed when the laws regulating the distribution of life come to be explained. The Littoral or Coast islands may be re-"], [49, "HEIGHT AND VOLUME OF CONTINENTS. 33 continental parts. To these belong the \" Skjaren \" (or skerries), the rocky islands on the coast of Scandinavia and Scotland, and the numerous islands with which all fjord-cut coasts are littered. Fjords we shall consider later on. Accordingly, accepting the opinion of Krummel that the other parts of the globe were, unlike Europe, considerably underrated by Hum boldt, we may take the following figures, in round numbers, as the average heights of the continents : \u2014 The Mean Height of Continents is, accord ing to Laplace, about 3r280 feet, though Hum boldt estimated the elevation of Europe at only 1,010 feet. As central Africa had not been explored when the great German geo grapher made his calculations,* he could only guess at the elevation of the interior of that \" dark continent.\" However, with our present knowledge, it may be accepted that the mean height of Asia is equal to that of Africa, and that of Australia almost equals that of Europe. If so, the mean or average elevation of all the continents would be 1,135 feet, Asia and South America being the highest, Europe and North America \u2014 leaving Africa out of the reckonino; \u2014 the lowest. Of late Gustav Leipoldt f has re-calculated the data on which Humboldt based his generalisations, so far as Europe is concerned, with the following results : \u2014 j Europe 984 feet. Asia 1,640 ,, si Africa 1,640 \u201e America 1,345 \u201e Australia 820 \u201e The mean height of the continents would therefore be 1,285 feet. The latest calcula tions put the mean depth of the oceans and seas at 2,000 fathoms,** which is diminished to 1,880 fathoms, in consequence of the shoal ness of the littoral zone and of the narrow seas. Thus the mean height of the con tinents appears to be not more than one eighth as much as the mean depth of tilts seas by which they are surrounded. The volume or bulk of the continents, so far as they lie above the level of the sea, is calculated to be 146,750 cubic miles, which will give 3,144,380 cubic miles for the seas of the world. Comparing these two figures, they are as 1 to 2 14. The seas therefore comprise 21 '4 times the continental masses, and, if all the inequalities of the continents cast off into the seas be taken into account, the slight loss of the mean depth would amount to no more than 87 fathoms. The North Atlantic basin, the area of which is 10,124,800 square miles, or nearly as large as the surface of all the continents, could alone almost embrace more than double (2'26) all the continents lying above the level of the sea ; or, if the whole of these were tossed into the basin of the ocean, they would diminish its depth to only 1,163 fathoms. If, remarks Peschel,f-j- the portions of the continents projecting under the level of the seas were removed so as to present a plain, by making * Humboldt: \"Kleine Schrif ten\" (1853). t \" Uber die mittlere Hohe Europa's \" (1874). * The decimals are omitted, as the calculations are, at best, only approximate. % Cha vanne in 1881 estimated the mean height of Africa at 2,168 feet, which is unquestionably too high. \u00a7 Denmark itself is very low.

Near the coast the land under the ocean is generally, for some distance at least, similar to that which borders it. If, as on the west coast of England, the shore is high, or, as on the east, a plain, then it will be continued with the same character for some distance out to sea. But once the depths of mid-ocean are reached, the variation is less \u2014 so little, indeed, that were the observer to be placed at the bottom of the sea the country around him, with its gentle undula tions, without abrupt changes, would appear almost like a level plain. the bed of the Atlantic of one uniform level, the hollow space remaining would be suffi cient for an ocean extending above the level of the Atlantic, while the engulfed con tinents would be still left with a depth around them of 240 fathoms, or five times deeper, on an average, than the North Sea. From these calculations we perceive that the inequalities of the continental masses are very slight when compared with the bulk of the continents, which rise like immense plateaux from the top of the ocean. Viewed from the bottom of the North Atlantic, the shores of the earth would appear like elevated plains 11,300 feet high, or higher than the crest of the Alps, above the level of the sea. The Bottom of the Sea. \u2014 Of the shape of the bottom of the sea we can form only an approximate or general idea. The places covered by the ocean are protected from the destructive agencies which are the principal means by which the rest of the earth has been given its present relief. The force of the currents is least at great depths. The wind does not act, and of course the rivers, and the glacier, and the rainfall, are equally inoperative at the bottom of the sea. The bed is, however, sinking in certain places and rising in others, so that, to a certain moderate degree, we can premise what like the\u00bb covered portion may be or what like it actually is. But for the great depths only the sounding-lead is available as an interro gator. This cord tells the number of fathoms through which it sinks before land is reached, and the material brought up on the tallow of the \" lead,\" or in the more effective apparatus which, for scientific purposes, has displaced that primitive instrument, affords a tangible indication of the geological con stituents of the bottom. From researches conducted in this fashion, we are able to say that, in general terms, there are elevated plains, hills, and valleys, deep glens, and sharp ridges beneath the ocean, just as there are above it, though the differences of levels are, for the most part, united by gentle slopes. The sea bottom is, however, not a repetition of the dry land, so far as its configuration The volcanic and coral islands are excep tions to this rule, as they rise, in many instances, almost abruptly from the depth of the sea ; while the continents rise gradually and gracefully from the depths of the ocean to immense high plains, the inequalities of which on the surface are, as we have seen by comparing the masses together, very small in comparison with the immense foundations upon which they are built up from the depths of the sea. The present coast lines nowhere define the true border line of continental elevation and oceanic depression. Along the continent is often found a more or less wide zone of an inferior depth of the sea, in which the conti nents under the sea form an ocean basin. This submarine border of the continents is generally defined by the 100-fathom line, from which line the sea depths advance rapidly, so that, in some instances, the 1,000-fathom line lies nearer to the coast than the 100-fathom one. Thus, for example, the only boundary line between Europe and the Atlantic basin is the 100-fathom line, which extends from the South of Norway, round Scotland and Ireland in a southerly direction to the Bay of Biscay. In this manner Great Britain appears as a part of the European continent. This submarine continent stretches along the coast of North America far into the sea, and forms the well known banks of Newfoundland. The most remarkable example of this is the south-east of Asia, where there is a shallow arm of the sea between the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. Between Java and Borneo the depth is not"], [51, "THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. 35 more than 50 fathoms, but between Borneo and Celebes, in a north-southern direction, a depth of 100 fathoms is recorded. The same depth prevails between New Guinea, Australia, and Tasmania, and between the Japanese islands and China similar conditions obtain ; while it forms a band connecting America with Asia across Behring Strait, Ceylon with Hindo stan, and the Falkland Islands with the South American continent. The 500-fathom line connects North America, Greenland, Iceland, and the F\u00e6roe Islands and the continent of Europe. The 1,000-fathom line connects New Zealand with Australia.Madagascar with Africa, and nearly exhausts the depth of the more or less land-locked seas which lie between Aus tralia and Asia, Africa and Europe, North and South America, and of the seas situated be tween the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. The Cape de Verde Islands and the Canaries belong to Africa, Madeira to Europe, and less than 500 fathoms divide Norway from Spitzbergen.* The great depths, we shall by-and-by see, are, in most cases, of very ancient date, and point to a long disseverance between the masses of land which they divide, with corresponding differences in the plants and animals of the two localities, places comparatively close together \u2014 as Bali and Lombok, in the Malay Archi pelago \u2014 but separated by a deep strait, being, so far as their fauna are concerned, different regions ; while other islands much farther apart, though with a shallower sea inter vening, are to a -great extent identical in these respects. The transporting power of the currents gradu ally lessens, and finally altogether ceases, so that the land-derived materials are not found at a greater distance from the shore than from 60 to 300 miles, or at a greater depth than about 2,000 feet, being thus confined to a com paratively narrow belt round the margins of continents and islands. In the vast area over which no such land-borne materials are deposited, a remarkable red clay and various kinds of ooze, made up largely of the shells of the jelly-specks called foraminifera, mollusca which live in the open ocean, and of similar organised beings, are found (Fig. 12). The red clay is very widely distributed. Indeed, it has been found wherever the \" abysmal regions of the oceanic basin \" have been sounded. It is described as extremely fine-grained, and owes its deep brown or red colour to the presence of the oxide of manganese and iron. \" Scattered through this deposit occur particles of various minerals of volcanic origin, together with lapilli and fragments of pumice, i.e., volcanic ejecta menta. Such materials may have been thrown out from terrestrial volcanoes, and carried by the winds or floated by currents until they became water-logged and sank ; or they may to some extent be the relics of submarine eruptions. Whatever may have been their immediate source, they are unquestionably of volcanic origin, and are not associated with any truly terragenous sediment. The red clay is evi dently the result of the chemical action of sea water on volcanic products, and many facts con spire to show that its formation is an extremely slow process.\" Thus, remains of back-boned animals, consisting of the ear-bones of whales, the teeth of sharks, and so forth, are often plentifully present, though there is no reason to suppose, as Murray and Renard point out, that the parts of the ocean where these remains occur are more frequented by sharks and whales than the regions where they are rarely or never dredged up. These remains seem to have lain there for a long period, for they are thickly coated with manganese and iron, and belong to extinct species. Meteoric dust, ejected from celestial bodies immeasurably distant from the earth, is also mixed up with this covering of Another fact which recent deep-sea dredg ing expeditions have brought to light is that the great depressions in the bottom of the ocean are of very ancient date. We see rivers bringing down silt and depositing it in the sea, and the waves tearing down the cliffs, and then throwing the debris into the water beyond. The coarser fragments naturally sink first \u2014 that is, nearest to the land ; the lighter are carried farther out, while the fine mud is drifted to a still greater depth. But nowhere does the sounding-lead, in the abyss of the ocean, bring up any land-derived materials. \" Wild : \"Thalassa \" (1877), p. 13."], [52, "36 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. the}7 are coral structures founded upon the shoulders of degraded volcanoes and mountain chains, and built up to the surface by the inde fatigable labours of the humble polyp. We come, then, to the general conclusion that oceanic basins and intervening continental ridges are great primeval wrinkles in the earth's crust \u2014 that they are due to the sink ing down of that crust upon the cooling and contracting nucleus. These vast wrinkles had come into existence long before the formation the ocean bed. All the facts of which we are at present in possession go to dissipate the idea, until very lately ahnost universally held, that every inch of ground now above the sea might in some remote period have been covered by thousands of fathoms of water. When we find marine animals embedded in rocks at the summits of mountains, there is no escaping the conclusion that the sea once rolled over the materials out of which these rocks are composed. But it does not necessarily follow, Fig. 12.\u2014 SOME CONTENTS OF THE DEEP SEA SLIME (Glohigerina ooze). 1, Globigerina bulloides ; 2, Orbulina universa ; 3, Textuiaria : 4, Cristellaria ; B, Coccolith ; 6, 7 Discnlith \u2022 S, Coceosphere ; 9, Haliuiunia (Radiolarian).

On the contrary, it is now generally held that \" abysmal waters have never prevailed over the regions now occupied by dry land ; nor is there any evidence to show that conti nental land masses ever existed in what are now the deepest portions of the ocean. The islets dotted over the surface of the Pacific and the other great seas are not the relics of a vast submerged continent. They are either the tops of submarine volcanic mountains or of our oldest geological strata. All our rocks may, in short, be looked upon as forming a mere superficial skin, covering and concealing the crystalline materials which no doubt formed the original surface of the earth's crust.\" * Vertical Elevation of the Land Masses. Lowlands and Highlands are the two great divisions into which the dry land may be divided, if we consider it as regards its eleva tion above the sea. There are plains and * James Geikie : \" The Geographical Evolution of Europe\" ([Scottish Geographical Magazine, Vol. II , pp. 193\u2014207)."], [53, "LOWLANDS AND HIGHLANDS. 37 swampy lands in contradistinction to moun tains or hilly country. The plains or lowlands are commonly found in localities which bear evidence of having been at one time under the sea. They are usually under a thousand or eleven hundred feet in height, and, as might be expected, generally skirt the sea-board of continents, stretching into the interior in the form of broad valleys. One plain \u2014 the largest in the world \u2014 stretches from the centre of Britain across Europe and Asia, ending in the north by the shores position ; while the limestone plains of Ireland and the plains of Cheshire are, among others, due to \" marine erosion \" ofthe upturned edges of the underlying strata. Either before or after the sea covered these plains, the rocks got broken, twisted, bent, and disturbed in all manner of ways by the subterranean movements always going on. But the level not having been altered, the sea soon wore them down, shaved them, as it were, into a uniform smoothness, just as the plane of the carpenter reduces the irregularities of the plank to one level. Fig. 13. \u2014 \"PUSZTA\" OE PLAIN OF HDNGAET. Their borders are generally marked by terraces which tell plainly the tale of gradual elevation. Any point above 1,100 or 1,200 feet is usually regarded as high land ; any less mean elevation may be taken as low land. A certain physiognomical character is com mon to all the extensive plains, which occur in the large continents, in the possession of a very uniform vegetation, or in being very bare of plant-life. In North-western and Central Europe they are known as \" Heaths ; \" in Hun gary as \" Puszten \" (Fig. 13) ; in South Russia and Western Asia as \" Steppes \" (Fig. 10) ; on the northern coast of Russia and Siberia as '\u25a0' Tundras ; \" in Africa as \" Deserts \" (Fig. 11) ; of the Arctic Ocean, and in the south in Asia Minor and Eastern Siberia, though, of course, divided into two by the Oural Mountains. Another great plain is that which is spread along the eastern sea-board of America, ex tending up the broad valley of the Mississippi. Many of these plains, it is clear from the evidence of the marine remains found in the soil, formed, in periods geologically very recent, the bed of the sea, and, were the level of the land to be slightly depressed, would again become, in part at least, an expanse of water.

Munich is on such a plateau, 1,673 feet high ; and Lhasa, the isolated capital of Tibet, is built in the midst of those vast levels on the other side of the Himalayas, which attain an eleva tion, as in the Kuenluen, of from 10,000 to nearly 13,000 feet. Quito, the capital of the South American Republic of Ecuador, is placed at an elevation on the Andes of 9,528 feet ; while the wonderful civilisation of the Aztecs and Toltecs of Mexico, and of the Incas of Peru, was alike matured at great elevations, the people of the dense tropical forests at lower heights never rising above the savagery of the American tribesmen. The city of Mexico stands 7,482 feet, and Cuzco, the capital of the Incas, 11,380 feet, above the sea ; while Santa Fe de Bogota, in Colombia, is at an elevation of 8,413 feet. Table-lands lie sometimes on the surface of beds of rock which, though apparently horizontal, are in reality \" in curves, the bends occupying long distances, so as to be almost imperceptible in some cases,\" but visible, even to the untrained eye, in others. Dr. Duncan cites High Peak or Kinder Scout, in Derbyshire, as a small, though fine, example of this kind of table land. The flat-topped hills of the Black Mountains, which the spectator can see in the distance as he stands on the top of the Malvern Hills, looking to the west towards Wales, may also be regarded as good types of English plateaux. On the summit of the Cotswold Hills is a greater table-land, with a slight slope to the east, though, of course, small compared with those mentioned, or even with the table-land of Magdala, the basaltic plateaux of the Coiron, in central France, or the numerous plateaux which are found in the Atlas and other mountains. in North America as \" Prairies ; \" and in Spanish America as \" Savannahs,\" \" Pampas,\" or \" Llanos.\" Most of these are of a very recent geological date, which may be indicated by the limits of the Tertiary seas. We see in this manner basins formed in similar localities, such as the basin of Vienna, the great Hun garian basin, the London and Paris basins, &c. But where a rapidly-flowing river de scends from heights we see that the basin is coterminous with the bed of the river, as the watershed of the Po, the river-bed of the Rhine, the Delta of the Ganares, and the low lands of the Mississippi. All these newer formations are composed by detritus from the highlands, made up of sand, boulders, clay, and loam. In them are frequently found the saline efflorescence which may be seen in the Hungarian plains and in the Russian steppes, and above them we may see the deposits of turf, which are noticeable in the German Sar matian plains. Some of these depressions in the inner portions of continents might be converted into inland seas if there were a general depres sion of the crust of the earth. Under such a condition the waters would easily flow into them. From the Black Sea to the Caspian we observe such a depression, the effect of which has been to throw the level of the Caspian more than 82 feet below the surface of the ocean, its bed being on an average 2,982 feet lower still. A similar depression or dislocation causes the Jordan to run in a glen, the termination of which at the Dead Sea is 1,298 feet below the level of the Mediter ranean ; while the bed of the Dead Sea is in places 2,598 feet below the surface of the nearest sea.* The highlands are composed of upland forests, hills, and mountains ; and between the levels of the plains and the high lands we often see \" foot hills \" arranged in a terrace-like form. Table-lands. \u2014 Plateaux, or upland flats, are never found at a lower elevation than 1,300 feet. These table-lands occur in various parts of the world, and though in many cases These plateaux owe their character mainly to the absence of water. Were they subject to great rainfall, or to the action of rivers, they would soon cease to be table-lands, and would be cut up into mountains, divided from each other by valleys, at the bottom of which * Hull: \"Mount Seir \" (1886); \"Physical Geology and Geography of Arabia Petr\u00e6a, Palestine, &c.\" (1886)."], [55, "TABLE-LANDS. 39 a stream should flow, or, if the strata were more resisting, by gorges through which roar ing currents should find their way to the sea. These plateaux are more or less every where, either on the summits of mountains or arranged on terraces around them, and in every case are coterminous either with an axis of depression or elevation. Their influence on the climate is remarkable, and, indeed, to the circumstances about to be described they owe much of their present condition. They are deprived of the revivi fying influence of the rain-clouds which, in drifting inland, are arrested by the mountains by which the table-lands are surrounded, the contents of the clouds being precipitated on the side of these greater elevations. This we see in Asia. The tropical winds, arrested by the Himalayas, discharge an abundant rainfall on the southern slope of that range, so that up to the line of perpetual snow there is luxuriant vegetation. But when we come to the plains of Tibet, on the other side, we find aridity in place of moisture, and a scanty amount of grass in place of tropical and semi tropical verdure. The surfaces of these table lands \u2014 as Ritter, Humboldt, and Guyot have pointed out \u2014 more heated than the layers of ah' of the same level, suck up like a sponge the little vapour it contains, without con densing it, while their extent and elevation tend to impede the access of the oceanic vapours and to increase the drought. This we see well marked in the plateaux of Central Spain, though these table-lands, on one of which Madrid is built, are only from two thousand to twenty-five hundred feet above the level of the sea ; for while the south-west coast of Portugal \u2014 Lisbon, for example \u2014 is watered with twenty-seven inches of rain, the border of the table-land has only eleven inches, and at Madrid, near to the centre, not more than ten inches of rain water fall in the course of tw7elve months. This is the lowest amount deposited on any place in Europe. Yet at the western foot of the Sierra d'Estrella, in the valley of Mondego, Coimbra is reported to have received in one year the enormous down pour of 225 inches. But even allowing that this record, which was for 1816-17, is affected by some error, and that 118 is nearer the truth, we have at two localities, in very nearly the same latitude, and in the same penin sula, a difference of more than 100 inches in the amount of annual rainfall \u2014 all owing to the difference of geographical position between Madrid and Coimbra, the plateau of Castile being 2,238 feet above the sea, while the lower lying Portuguese university town is exposed to the whole force of the moist Atlantic winds. What we see in the small plateaux of Spain is noticed much more markedly in the great table-lands of Eastern and Western Asia, which, owing to their vast extent, their height above the sea, and the fringe of snowy moun tains which shut them off from the beneficial influence of the sea-breezes, are almost or wholly deserts. In like manner, the plateaux of Southern Africa \u2014 the \" veldts \" of the Transvaal, for example (between six and seven thousand feet high) \u2014 are singularly dry, while those of Mexico and Nevada are, com pared with the immediately adjoining region at a lower elevation, and in a different physical situation, parched during a great portion of the year. At Vera Cruz, for example, the average rainfall is 62 inches, while at the city of Mexico there is a very moderate amount, though, curiously enough, the heaviest re corded rainfall (90 to 100 inches) occurs in the Huatusco district, at an altitude of 4,380 feet, owing to the fact that the uplands facing seaward are often wrapped in the fogs and mists of the Atlantic winds, and, as in the present instance, are deluged beneath the precipitated contents. It has often been supposed that the prairies of North America, and the corresponding treeless tracts in the southern part of the continent, with the steppes of the Old World, are treeless, owing to the lack of water during the growing season. Of late, however, this idea has been generally abandoned, .owing to the exact ob servations taken showing that, though the moisture received by such situations is httle, it is not insufficient for the growth of trees on the prairies, whatever may be the case in the table-lands, which do not come within that"], [56, "40 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. Mauvaises Terres, or \" Bad Lands \" of Western America (Fig. 14), owe their peculiar character to the soft permeable rocks of which they are composed, wearing away into forms of the most striking and even picturesque character, though utter sterility, due partly to the nature of the rock formation, and partly to the extreme dryness of the climate, holds designation. Professor Whitney advocates the theory that the extremely comminuted cha racter of the soil has more to do with this than anything else. \" Where, for any reason,\" he contends, \" the soil is of especially fine tex ture, there grasses will flourish in preference to forests, provided the rainfall is not entirely insufficient. Hence we see at once why plains Fig. 14. \u2014 \"BAD LANDS\" NEAR FORT BRIDGER. WYOMING TERRITORY, U.S.A. (After a Photograph.) are more likely than mountain slopes to be treeless. It is towards the plains that the finer materials, abraded by erosion and de nuding agencies from the higher regions, are being constantly carried, as they have been in former geological ages.

If, however, a table-land is to preserve its cha racter, an absence of water, or at all events of running water, is absolutely essential. Thus, we see the \" fjelds \" of Norway being gradually converted from level or undulating plateaux into a broken upland furrowed by rivers, and in time destined to be a clump of mountains divided by valleys, through which flow the streams which have eaten them out of the It thus appears that these plateaux are to a great extent due to the action of water in former times, while their characters in more modern days must be traced to the causes at present in operation, though it ma)7 be regarded as an open question how far the fine character of the soil favours grass in preference to trees. High winds sweep over them, and where the soil is not thickly covered with turf, the dust, which the dryness, combined with the absence of stones, favours, is often carried so far that the snows in the south and south-east of Russia are sometimes rendered dirty by the dust raised by wind on the Caspian steppes, and a similar account applies to the dust whirlwinds of the Orinoco and other treeless regions of the world.* original table-land. Isolated Rocks. \u2014 Sometimes in the high lands, as well as in the table-lands, and some times on the low-lying plains, we come upon lofty isolated rocks, dissevered from any similar surroundings. They appear like islands in a sea of land. To the geologist these rocks are of peculiar interest, for they open up to him a vast field of inquiry. Sometimes they are due to volcanic action. The subterranean forces have vomited forth lava, which, as in the case of many islands, like Ascension, leave a lump of slag or a mountain of cinders in mid-ocean. In other cases they are the remnants of very ancient volcanic action. In some remote period of the world's history there had been vast outbursts of this kind of fury, which forced immense discharges of lava through the over lying beds of softer rock. In time, by the constant wearing away of the surrounding rocks, this hard ': trap \" or \" whinstone,\" as we call it, is left isolated, being the last to resist the action of the rivers, the rains, and the other disintegrating agencies. This is well exemplified in the Dumbarton Rock, Ailsa Craig, the Bass Rock, and a host of similar landmarks in the scenery of Great Britain and other countries. In other cases, as in the Rock of Gibraltar (Fig. 15), the eminence appears as if broken off from the central axis of the range to which it naturally belongs. In these instances denudation \u2014 the wearing way process which we have indicated \u2014 has been going on around the island rock until it has become isolated from its system, the Hohenstaufen, Hohenzollern, and other high The dryness of the interior basins of great continents also gives rise to the saline efflor escences which so frequently gather on their surface. This we see in the steppes of Southern Russia, in the \" llano estacado \" of New Mexico (3,200 to 4,700 feet above the sea), in the \" alkali \" wastes around the Great Salt Lake of Utah, and in the sage bush region of Nevada, so familiar to every traveller in that country. These encrustations are the salts dissolved out of the soil by the rain which has sunk into it, and which, rising by means of capillary attraction, evaporates, and leaves behind the extraneous matter w7ith which it was laden. Alkali soil and alkali water are dreaded of the Western traveller. The Klamath Lakes in Oregon are, for example, utterly undrinkable from the amount of the efflor escences which have been drained into them by their feeding streams. It may be added, before leaving this subject, that some table lands, like that of Spain, are sharply divided from the surrounding country by a somewhat abrupt boundary. In other cases they grad ually slope upwards from the adjoining plains, as in the country west of the Missouri ; or, as * Humboldt : \" On Steppes and Desert,\" in \" Views of Nature,\" Vol. L, pp. 1-225 (Mrs. Sabine's Trans.)."], [59, "ISOLATED ROCKS 43 mountains of the Swabian Alps, being also examples in point. rain, and wind, and mist, which in a region \" the very home of all mists, and rain, and storm, and winds,\" exercise in an almost un approached degree then powerful sway. Here gather the streams which flow in various direc tions to swell the torrents of the Orinoco, the Essequibo, and the Amazon. Roraima, as the Indians say, is the \" mother of streams.\" Its summit is, in reality, a very slightly hollowed basin, in w7hich the moisture condensed by the countless pillars of absorbent sandstone which cover its surface collects. These tiny streamlets are rapidly cutting for themselves deep channels through the rim of the rock basin before emerging from it in one wild leap over the steep precipice.* Mount Twek kway, about fifty miles NNW. of Roraima, is a similar elevation, though not so high. It is flat-topped, with vertical walls, but differs \u2014 according to Mr. Whitley, who ascended it in 1886 \u2014 in being wooded at the summit, and in the water not falling over the edge of the plateau, as in Roraima, but draining off by a cavity of great depth in the middle. The Sierras de Erere and Obidos, the table-topped mountains so noticeable in ascending the Amazon River, and the somewhat similar formation on the opposite bank at the rear of Santarem, are also quite conformable with Roraima. Such hills are found in many parts of Brazil, and are really gigantic pillars cut by the action of water and rain from the body of the great plateau of which they originally formed a part.f One of the most interesting of these isolated rocks, or rather mountains, is Roraima, in British Guiana. It is between 8,000 and 9,000 feet in height, or about 5,000 above the level of the plain from which it rises isolated, w7ith almost inaccessible precipices on every side. Roraima is, in short, as Mr. im Thurn, who first ascended it, writes, a flat-topped pillar, itself some 2,500 feet in height, set on a very steeply-sloped truncated cone of about another 2,500 feet in height ; or, rather, \" first imagine a flat-topped mason-wrought pillar of about 25 feet in height, set on a steeply-sloped pediment of another 25 feet,\" and the diffi culty of reaching the summit of Roraima may be imagined. Yet the mountain is not soli tary, unique, or peculiar ; for though remark able in form, it is only the most famous, slightly the most lofty, and perhaps really the most striking of a group of similar mountains. Their shape is due to the wearing-away of the rocks around their base. Just as in winter when a thaw has set in after a heavy snow, on the vanishing snow-drifts small pillarets of snow, capped and protected each by some small pebble, are ranged over the surface ; so in the tropics, after some terrific downpour of rain, similar pillarets of earth remain on some thrown-up heap of loose soil. On the savannah, where the surface conglomerate pro tects the soil beneath, these \" eppelings \" \u2014 as the Indians call them \u2014 are very frequent. \" Eppelings \" on this comparatively small scale abound in the vicinity of Roraima, which Mr. im Thum regards siruply as an \" eppeling \" on a gigantic scale, formed in the same way, and like its companion pillar mountains altogether, except in its gigantic size, equivalent to the pillarets on the loose water-washed earth, to the pillarets of snow on the snow-drifts, or the ice pillars which in exactly similar circumstances are so fre quently seen on glaciers.

This we see in the Scandinavian peninsula, in Scotland, in the north and west of Ireland and England, in Normandy and Brittany, in the south of France, in the Hyeres Islands, in Sardinia and Corsica, in most part of the Spanish peninsula, in the Vosges, the Black Forest, and the chains of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, &c. These ranges are of unequal shape and development, but generally take a longitudinal direction, so as to form a series of elevated masses. The loftier por tions of these groups usually run towards the south-east, with the exception of the Scan dinavian peninsula, where the north-west has that pre-eminence over most of the region, or from the south-west to the north-east, which is the rule in the Bohemian and Moravian mountains. tains proper. Mountain Shapes. \u2014 Apart, however, from the causes that have led to their formation, and which will come to be more fully dis cussed at a later stage, the geographer re cognises, as regards their shape \u2014 cup-shaped, massive of table, and chain mountains. In these descriptions of elevated lands all kinds of rocks are found \u2014 volcanic, granitic, and porphyritic ; but the first named enter for the most part into the composition of the cup shaped or crater-topped mountains, which arc generally extinct volcanoes. A familiar ex ample is afforded by the middle range of the Leitmeritz mountains of Bohemia (Fig. 16), the Euganean hills of Padua, the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne in France, the volcanic Eifel in Germany (where many of the old craters are, as is also the case in the extinct volcanoes of the Cascades in Oregon, occupied by lakes), the Siebengebirge, &c. In the British Isles there are many such hills, though none perhaps as marked or of such recent date as those mentioned. \" Chained \" mountains, like the Himalayas and the Andes, may be regarded as the back bones of continents. They run in direct lines, of which the length is much greater than the breadth ; though, looking at the conventional signs on maps, one has some difficulty in understanding that a range like the Rocky Mountains is, in reality, a vast mountainous region instead of a single chain, and, the great heights apart, that, owing to the long distance of the mountains from the sea (from the level of which the altitudes are measured), the elevations are not higher than they seem, or more imposing than lower chains farther west.* The Cascades are much more strik ing ; so are the Andes from the Pacific ; and, though the average height of the New Zealand Alps is less than that of the North American cordillera, they present, owing to the causes mentioned, a more striking appearance. The loftiest point at present known is.

We see, as a result of this combination, that the axes of the mountain-chains have been shifted, and that other and ancillary chains are developed at different angles to the main one.

Yet, as Dr. Archibald Geikie has observed in his clear exposition of these phenomena, whde the general parallelism of any lateral offshoots is preserved, no single range may be observed for more than a comparatively short distance. After running for a few miles it \" may be found to pass insensibly into another, while a third may be seen to begin on a slightly different line, and to continue with the same dominant trend until it in turn becomes confluent.\" The various ranges of the Alps, the Himalayas, though the exact elevation of the Andean peaks has still to be ascertained by processes more scientific than those by which the heights o-iven have been obtained. Little over half the elevation of the loftiest Himalayan peaks is reached by the highest mountains of Europe. Mont Blanc (Fig. 19) is 15,781 feet high; Monte Rosa, 15,217 feet; and the Ortler, 12,814 feet ; so that none of these mountains is equal to t?Vt of the ave rage diameter of the earth. Hence, if this dia meter be taken, for the sake of comparison, at thirteen feet, from 00787 to 0'1181 part of an inch may be regarded as the average height of these excrescences on the surface of the terrestrial ball. In Fig. 18, which is a dia grammatic section of a portion of Switzerland, we see how comparatively little the Alps alter the curvature of the surface. From Bale to Eig. 18. \u2014 SECTION OF SWITZEKLAND. the crest of the Jura the curve is 1\u00b0 37', while from Bale to the crest of the Alps it is 1\u00b0 43', so that the curve increases only from 1\u00b0 to 2\u00b0 in a length which may be taken as and the Andes, are thus apt to assume an \" arrangement en echelon.\" In these cases lon gitudinal valleys separate the different ridges, these depressions being very narrow in propor tion to their length, while, in other instances, the ranges are trenched in a direction transverse to their trend by deep valleys. The valley of the Rhone, from its source down to Martigny, is a good example of the first class. The second order of valleys is illustrated by the Rhone also, in its course from Martigny to the Lake of Geneva. In many mountain ridges a pass or col \u2014 that is, a depression \u2014 connects the heads of two adjacent transverse valleys. These passes have for ages been of prime im portance in the Alps, though some of the most famous ones are becoming of less value owing to the formation of the tunnels under them. from J\u201e to 3V The average crest height of the Andes, (11,713 feet) is greater by nearly one-half than that of the Alps (7,677 feet), and the crest height of the Himalayas (14,993 feet) is one quarter greater than that of the Andes, while the heights of the Pyrenees are so small that they reach only the mean altitude of the Alps. In the Pyrenees the average crest height is 7,992 feet, which shows the dwarfish character of that range, as well as that of the Alps, with which it is comparable. In the Old World the mountain chains run chiefly from east to west, the Alps, the Pyre nees, the Caucasus, and the Himalayas, being examples. In the New World the course is generally from north to south, the Rocky Mountains and the Andes being familiar types of the rule. Sometimes when, as in Western Most mountain ranges \u2014 the Alps, among others \u2014 show every sign of having been formed by successive upheavings and depressions dur ing geological periods, the duration of which"], [63, "47 MOUNTAIN SHAPES. it is impossible even to indicate with any approach to accuracy. The central portion of the chain is composed of gneiss, schists, granite, and other crystalline rocks, for the most part of very ancient date. The outline was formed by the wrinkling of the still-heated ball of the earth in primeval ages. On this mould were deposited, subsequent to its submergence, various strata, after which the youthful Alps were re-elevated into land. From the evidence supplied by the rocks which superimpose them, it seems that repeated uplifting and wearing away followed, and that during comparatively recent geological times the mountains were again submerged, the grand upheaval, to which the present magnitude of the mountain is chiefly due, following this era in their history. \" The older Tertiary rocks, previously horizon tal under the sea, were raised up into mountain ridges more than 11,000 feet above the sea level, and, together with the older formations of the chain, were crumpled, dislocated, and inverted. So intense was the compression and shearing to which clays and sands were sub jected that they were converted into hard crystalline rocks. It is strange to reflect that the enduring materials out of which so many of the mountains, cliffs, and pinnacles of the Alps have been formed are of no higher geological antiquity than the London Clay and other soft Eocene deposits of the south of England and the north of France and Belgium. At a later stage of Tertiary time renewed disturbance led to the destruction of the lakes in which the molasse had accumulated, and their thick sediments were thrust up into large mountain ranges, such as the Righi, Rossberg, and other promi nent heights along the northern flank of the Alps. Since that great movement no paroxysm seems to have affected the Alpine region except the earthquakes, which from time to time show the process of mountain-making to be only suspended, or still slowly in progress.\" * they possess for the less-instructed lover of the mere picturesque. The one is content to accept results ; the other attempts to analyse the causes which have produced these effects. Hence, as we have seen, the theories devised to account for their various phenomena have been more numerous than acceptable. Elie de Beaumont and Von Buch contended, for example, that all mountain chains of the same age have the same general direction. This assumption takes for granted that the earth's crust had been elevated at various periods \" by forces acting at all places in parallel direc tions.\" Accordingly, about fifteen systems of elevation are distinguished in Europe. But we already know that such a generalisation must be very cautiously received, many moun tains not having been reared by a single im pulse, but by several acting at different periods. Nor have the elevations of any one epoch been effected in parallel and straight lines. At the same time, we may admit that in a broad way this theory has a basis of truth, and if inadmissible in detail, serves as a good foundation on which to raise a doctrine of mountain -building more in keeping with known facts. When this aspect of our sub ject comes to be considered, it will be found that the physical geographer has at his dis posal materials for intelligent wonder even more ample than those on which the painter draws. The artist sees in the Alps only a confused sea of mountains gilded with the morning sun, or shot with the evening gold. He glories in the play of cloud effects, in the lakes glistening in the hollows, in the glaciers creeping through the valleys. But the geo grapher evolves order out of the apparent chaos, and finds his delight in studying the causes to which these phenomena are due. The lofty mountain ranges, by deflecting winds which strike obliquely, have an im portant influence on the distribution' of heat and moisture. For example, the west w7inds from the Pacific, on coming in contact with the coast ranges of California, are turned south ward and become north winds. Finally, on leaving the attractive subject of mountains, it will be seen from the profiles (Figs. 20 \u2014 23) Mountains, indeed, have ever had an attrac tion for the geographer almost as great as * Archibald Geikie : \" Text-Book of Geology \" (1885), p. 933 ; Proceedings of the Boyal Geographical Society, (1879), pp. 422\u2014443. and Edward Suess : \" Die Entste hung der Alpen \" (1875)."], [64, "Fig. 19.\u2014 MONT BLA.NC 05,781 feet).

The heaviest materials sink first, the lightest fall last, and are therefore at the top. The materials entering into the com position of these rocks are also in many in stances the same as those which make up the imbedded or \" unstratified \" ones, so that we are entitled to infer that the bedded rocks are formed by the wearing away by water of the imbedded ones, and that the former are there fore newer than the latter. Moreover, while in some instances we find that the beds aro lying quite horizontal, just like the layers of clay at the bottom of a pond into which a muddy stream flows, in many other instances they are broken, thrown out of position, twisted, altered as if by great pressure and heat, and not unfrequently bent into an arch or absolutely turned upside down. We are consequently compelled to conclude that since they were laid down violent disturbances have been going on, and vast ages have elapsed, and as in many countries we see that the imbedded rocks have burst through the bedded ones, and formed wall-like masses or branches through their midst, the natural conclusion is that the disturbing agent has most frequently been those molten materials which form the foundation, as it were, of the world. When we cease examining the general con tour of the globe, its hills and valleys, its seas and lands, and dig into the ground beneath our feet, we see that it is composed of various kinds of rocks. Some of them are soft beds of clay and sand, others are hard masses of granite, whinstone, and so forth, though all of them are, in the language of the geologist, \" rocks.\" What is more, a very brief examin ation convinces us that some of these rocks are arranged in regular beds ; while others are \"without form,\" though, as they are often thrown up in beetling crags, and in the shape of masses obtruding through the bedded rocks, by no means \" void.\" Again, on taking a still more minute survey, the intelligent student of the world in which he lives will in many cases notice that while the imbedded rocks \u2014 the granites, the whinstones, or traps and their kindred \u2014 are bare of life, the bedded or \" stratified \" ones are full of the remains of plants and animals which lived in former periods of the earth's history. In rocks which we learn to recognise as the oldest, these \" fossils \" \u2014 something \" dug out,\" as the word means \u2014 are most widely dissimilar from any thing now existing ; while in those which are of comparatively recent date, the species approximate more and more to the forms now existing ; and in the uppermost beds of all are species identical with the species now liv ing in our seas and on the surface of the globe, though in most cases the distribution of the dead and living forms is widely different. Some rocks, indeed, like coal, many lime stones, and chalk, are actually made up of the remains of plants or animals. We thus see that \" the stony rocks are not eternal but the daughters of Time.\" Examining still more This much is evident to the least instructed eye. But on scrutinising still more closely the materials out of which the earth is com posed with a view to study its story, we ascer tain that the beds are not only of various"], [67, "STRATIFIED ROCKS. 51 materials but of varied origin. They differ also as regards their texture. Some, for ex ample, are masses like granite, others fissile or laminated like slate, others \" schistose \" like mica, others \" oolitic,\" or \" pisolitic \" like Bath stone, others \" amygdaloidal \" \u2014 i.e., with almond-shaped cavities filled with minerals. In some basalts we find these almond-shaped cavities ; in others there is a slaggy or scoria ceous appearance, while in another series of rocks the beds seem of uneven texture, being made up of rounded or angular stones, all cemented together, but of very different origin. been the agent mainly at work in their for mation and distribution through the earth's crust. Hence we call them unstratified, or igneous, or Plutonic rocks, Pluto being the god of fire. They also, like the stratified ones, are divisible into two minor sub-groups in accordance with the traces which they present of having been unaltered or altered since last the internal fire of the earth had been assorting them. The Stratified Rocks. These, though the newest, we may, for con venience, sake, take first, as this mode of examination will enable us better to under stand what follows when we begin to study the unstratified ones, which have played so leading a part in their formation and disloca tion. We have already learned that there is evidence of these rocks not having all been formed in exactly the same way, though water has evidently been the prime agent in their disposition. A close inquiry conducted on Again, while some \"rocks\" are soft like sand or chalk, others are compact or granular, like many sandstones used for building pur poses, while others are vitreous or flinty. They differ also, as we shall learn at a later stage of our studies, in the mineral materials out of which they are composed. In some mica predominates, in others silica or quartz, in many lime is the ruling substance, in a great many felspar and hornblende are the chief minerals, and in the vast beds of coal which form so important a portion of the earth's crust, carbon, in the shape of the re mains of ancient masses of vegetation, is almost the sole ingredient. However, no matter from what point of view they are studied, we find that all the materials entering into the ground beneath our feet may be conveniently divided into two great series : (1) Rocks which are arranged in strata or beds, and which have been de rived by the wearing down of other rocks, and for the most part deposited in these layers by the action of water. Hence they are generally known as stratified rocks, or derivative, or aqueous, or Neptunian, from Neptune, the god of the sea. Some of the strata, except that they are consolidated by agencies which we may consider in the proper place, are little altered from the condition in which they were originally laid down. But several of the older formations are metamor phosed, or altered. (2) Rocks which are found, like granite or trap, in shapeless beds, without any trace of stratification or the influence of water. On the contrary, fire seems to have Fig. 2-t. \u2014 STRATA OVERLYING EACH OTHER. The uppermost (5) is the newest, the age of the others being indicated by the order in which they lie, though a lon^ period may have elapsed between the laying down of the two in immediate contiguity. Number 3 shows the \"thinning out\" of a bed, indicating that it had been laid down by a river, the deposit from which will necessarily not be so thick far out at sea as nearer its mouth. these fines enables us to divide them into different groups, according to the apparent methods which have been at w7ork in laying them down (Fig. 24). Mechanically-formed Rocks. \u2014 The greater number of rocks have been formed by the wear ing down of the igneous ones, and of course are younger than they ; or by the destruc tion of other sedimentary strata formed in this fashion, after which these materials have been"], [68, "52 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. transported by means of water to the place in which they are found in the shape of beds. All the Argillaceous, or clay rocks, are of this nature. They are formed by the decom position of rocks in which felspar formed a part, the impurities being fine sand, flakes of mica, and the remains of plants or animals. The purest kind of clay is white, and very plastic ; but this property of clay is lost when the rock composed of it is subjected to great pressure, especially if accompanied by a high temperature. Hence, the highly plastic clays such as potter's or pipe clay, which is white and nearly pure, are of a more recent origin than those which are less fit for the potter's purpose. Fire-clay is nearly, if not quite, free from iron and alkalies, and contains much silica, or flinty matter, which, fusing under the action of heat, gives to the bricks made out of it a firmness which would otherwise be lacking. Carbon is also another ingredient, but, like silica, it is not found in quantities sufficient to prevent the bricks made out of it resisting the action of furnace heat. \" Clinch \" is a local name for a tough and more indurated clay. Loam is a soft and friable mixture of clay and sand, permeable by water, and much less plastic than clay. Mud and silt are the unconsolidated materials of some form of argillaceous rock, either clay, shale, or loam, as the case may be, and are commonly found in the beds of rivers, lakes, ponds, and similar situations. Marl is, again, a limey clay \u2014 a compound of clay and carbonate of lime, or carbonate of magnesia \u2014 which effervesces with acid, and when dry, cracks into cubical or rhomboidal fragments. It is commonly dug out of what have been the beds of ancient lakes, and owes its calcareous ingredients to the long, slow crumbling down of the shells of the fresh-water shell-fish which inhabit the water of these troughs in the earth's crust. When such a deposit contains less than fifty per cent, of clay it ceases to be a marl, and does not crumble on exposure to the air. It is then an \" argillaceous lime stone,\" or it may be micaceous, calcareous, dolomitic, or bituminous, according to the prevalence of certain substances. Sh?le is a laminated clay-rock, splitting into thin plates along the original lines of deposition. It passes into white clay, on one hand, and clay-slate on the other, but is usually more recent, geologically speaking, than true clay-slate. It constitutes a large pro portion of the strata composing the Coal Measures, forming sometimes the base, or more frequently the roof, of a coal pit, and is the larger part of the refuse heaped up in great piles near the shafts of many collieries, where it is known by the name of metal, plate, bind, blaes, or blues, kilve, and so forth. Some shales are bituminous, and therefore closely resemble very impure coal, for which, in new countries especially, they are often mis taken. Others are carbonaceous, arenaceous, micaceous, or calcareous, according as they con tain carbonaceous matter, sand, mica, or limey material. Clay-slate differs from the other argillaceous rocks in its cleavage structure, which renders it so valuable for roofing pur poses. This it owes to the alteration or metamorphosis which it has undergone, and it may therefore be most fittingly described with the metamorphic rocks. The Arenaceous or sandy rocks differ from the group described, in the fact that their constituents are either rounded pebbles or stones cemented together (conglomerate), an gular fragments in this condition (breccia), uncompacted stones (gravel or shingle), compacted grains (sandstone), or loose grains (sand). Conglomerate or pudding-stone forms vast beds in the earth's crust, and in California and other gold-mining regions, where it is known as cement, has been found rich in gold. The pebbles are of the most varied origin, and the rock which they unite to form is denominated a \" granitic \" or a \" calcareous \" \u2014 or any other \u2014 conglomerate, according to the predominance of any particular description of pebble or rolled stone in it. Very com monly quartz or some other flinty mineral or rock is the main material, and on that account conglomerates are usually very hard, and practically indestructible. The cement ing material may be calcareous, silicious,"], [69, "MECHANICALLY-FORMED ,OCKS. 53 ferruginous, or a mixture of lime, flinty matter, the fingers. In other cases, it is easier to frac or iron, the compactness of the pudding-stone ture the stones than the cement which binds Fig. 25. \u2014 DUREN LAKE AND MONTE CRISTALLO (DOLOMITE OF THE TRIAS), AMPEZZO VALLEY, SOUTH TYROL {Aster u Photograph.) them together, and in the cutting of such a rock the pebbles look like the raisins in a pud ding. Hence the popular name applied to it varying according to the character of the \u2014 j \u2014 o o cement. Sometimes it is so loose that the pebbles may be removed by mere pressure of"], [70, "54 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. almost every instance brought from a great distance, and though at one time they were believed to have been swept before some hypothetical flood, it is now generally held that they have been dropped from icebergs, by which, in a former condition of the country, they had been detached from distant cliffs, and carried far from their original home. The grains in a bed of loose sand are usually of silica or quartz (the purest form of which is rock crystal), though sometimes felspar, limestone, dolomite, or other minerals, are the predominating materials in this form of \" rock.\" A sandstone is, of course, simply sand cemented by some mineral substance, the character of the cement giving a name to the sandstone, and, combined with the pressure which it has originally undergone, imparting character to the rock. Again, according as the granules are large or small, the rock may vary from a fine grained sandstone, like that of Craigleith, out of which most of the city of Edinburgh is built, to the \" grits,\" in which the large grains of quartz being united by a hard silicious paste, constitute a stone extensively used for millstones all over the world. In brief, the difference between sand, sand-rock, sandstone, and grit, is simply one of degree, the one graduating into the other according to the size of the grains and the extent to which they are consolidated. In \" flexible sandstone,\" the grains are so arranged as to stand apart, as if some ingredient had been removed by water percolating through the mass. In other forms, minute scales of mica are dis seminated through the rock, so that if a thin slab is cut, it will bend backwards and forwards within certain moderate limits. Organically-formed Rocks. \u2014 These com- prise the beds which are evidently derived from the decay of animal and vegetable matter, either wholly, or in great part, though most rocks of the stratified series containing as they do fossils, can claim to be more or less made of organic remains. The Limestones are all comprised under the head organically-formed rocks. They are of varied colours, the principal ingredient in their composition being calcite, the colouring matter being oxide of iron, clay, carbon, and other impurities which have got mixed up with the lime derived from the worn-down shells, composed of material extracted from the sea in which the shell-fish lived. Some of these limestones are hard, and some crystal line, others are earthy-looking and soft, and between these extremes there are all grada tions, some of them being characteristic of particular geological formations. Thick and massive limestones exist of various colours (variegated marbles), which are much used in architecture. Beautiful marble is found to occur in the Alps, at Untersberg, near Salzburg (yellowish), near Ischl, Hallstatt, Adneth, and Hallein (mostly red marble), etc. This delicate marble is, as a rule, free from any admixture of clay, and from it is made lithographic stones, paving flags, etc. The whole world is supplied with its lithographic limestone from the quarries at Solenhofen and Eichstadt on the Altmtihl in Bavaria. Miscellaneous fragmental Rocks. \u2014 There is a third class of mechanically-formed rocks, which cannot be ranged under any of the foregoing heads. \" Rubble \" is, for example, an accumulation of angular fragments of various rocks indiscriminately thrown together. The pieces may be igneous or sedimentary, brought from a distance or derived from rocks in the immediate vicinity. They may have been swept down the current of a mountain torrent, or carried forward by a freshet or on an ice drift, or they may be the deljris piled at the base of a wasting cliff or precipice in the shape of a \" talus,\" such as often forms on the slope underneath the beetling crags of trap. Boulders, again, are large, water-worn, or at least rolled and rubbed blocks of stone, found on the soil amid surface material. These iso lated masses are frequently of vast size, are in Dolomite, a mixture of carbonate of lime and magnesia, is of a crystalline structure, leaky or cavernous, though its hardness is slightly higher than that of limestone. Coarse dolomite (Fig. 25), in great irregular masses, may be seen in South Tyrol, where it makes picturesque mountains, and, in"], [71, "55 ORGANICALLY-FORMED ROCKS. another form, in the Rock of Gibraltar (Fig. 15). up ot the microscopic valves of plants called diatoms. \" Bergmehl,\" or mountain meal, used by the natives of Finland and Lapland to mix with flour in times of scarcity, is of this nature, though it is perhaps needless to add it has no nutritive properties what ever. At Bilin, in Bohemia, there is a bed of \" Tripoli \" t 14 feet thick, which is used for polishing stones and metals, and in the Kawsoh Mountains, in Nevada, United States, there is a deposit 250 feet deep, some of the beds being 8 to 10 feet thick, and so full of these flinty-cased diatoms, that the substance contains nearly 90 per cent, of silica. Oolite is a limestone made up of minute spheroidal concretions, which look like the petrified roe of a fish ; hence the name.* It is whitish or yellowish, easily worked, and there fore largely used as a building stone under the name of Caen stone, Bath stone, and Port land stone. Each grain, if examined micro scopically, is found to consist of concentrated layers of carbonate of lime arranged around a central nucleus, which is generally a particle of sand. The theory of their formation is that this nucleus was kept in motion in a lake, or other enclosed area of water, thickly charged with carbonate of lime, until it got equally encrusted. If the grains are as large as peas, the rock into which they enter is termed \" pisolite,\" while in Germany the term \" Ro genstein \" is applied to a rock in which the oolitic particles are cemented by a somewhat clayey matrix or intermediary substance. Piso lite is well developed at Carlsbad, where the substance of the grains tends to form into ar ragonite. In the hot baths at that place, the water is so charged with carbonate of lime that if small objects are suspended in it they will soon get covered in the same way as the nucleus of the oolitic or pisolite grains did. It may be added that dolomitic pisolite, with large grains sometimes of magnesite, may be noted in the serpentine of Zebce, at Bosna, in Bosnia. Chalk, which will be considered when the formation of that name ( the Cretaceous) comes to be described, is also an organically-formed rock, the grains being, for the most part, the minute shells of the microscopic animals called foraminifera, which fell to the bottom of the sea in former periods of the earth's his tory, until they formed great beds, as indeed their modern representatives are slowly doing. The mountain limestone, so generally asso ciated with the coal beds, is, in many cases, so full of the stems of fossil stalked-star-fishes, or encrinites, and other animals, that it may be regarded as almost wholly composed of organic matter cemented together with a little impure lime derived from the same source. The Kelloway Rock is a sandy limestone, from three to five feet thick, abounding in fossil shells, indeed in most cases almost entirely made up of them, and so called from being well developed at Kelloway Bridge, in Wiltshire. Silicious limestones contain silica. These limestones are therefore harder than ordinary limestones, and, on decomposition of the calcareous matter, leave a flinty residuum, which is known as the \" rotten-stone \" of commerce. In the fossiliferous limestones of the Paris calcaire we see a repetition of the Leitha chalk of the Vienna basin. There are tw7o chief varieties of this limestone. One \u2014 Lithotham nium chalk \u2014 contains the remains of the coralline seaweed peculiar to this formation (Lithothamnium ramosissimam, Reuss), with the shells of mollusca. This is found in the quarries at Wbllersdorf and Brunn, near Stein feld, in the Leitha mountains near Mannersdorf, \" Bath Brick \" is manufactured at Bridge water from a tidal deposit of silicious silt, from the River Parret, in Somersetshire, at the junction of the fresh and salt waters. Its peculiar properties are probably owing to the flinty cases of minute animalcul\u00e6, destroyed by the salt tidal water when it meets the fresh water of the river ; and masses of rock, such as the Tripoli or polishing slate, etc., are made + It derives this name from having been originally obtained from the Turkish province of that name, in Northern Africa. * Oiiit, Greak for an egg."], [72, "56 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. and in the imperial quarries near Zogelsdorf, at the side ofthe Bohemian and Moravian \"massifs.\" The other \u2014 the Amphistegina chalk with shells of foraminifera, especially of the Amphistegina Haueri of D'Orbigny \u2014 is more solid than the Lithothamnian limestone, and is found in the quarries of St. Margaret on the Neusiedl Lake, near Loretto, in the Leitha Mountains, etc. exist without feeling the responsibilities of government, this unhappy state owes many of the troubles which in time overtook her. All that the Peruvians did was to authorise the digging of the guano, and to draw on the proceeds. The work was chiefly done by Chinamen, and as the ammoniacal fumes injured the eyes of the workmen, it is hard to imagine labour more toilsome or less grate ful than shovelling the garnered ordure of generations of sea-fowl into the holds of the guano ships. The Chincha deposits were nearly exhausted several years ago, and the little that still remains on other islands along the Peruvian coast is being rapidly denuded, though the estimates as to the amount still remaining are so contradictory that it is needless to repeat them. Peruvian guano is especially rich in phosphate of lime, derived from organic remains and ammoniacal salts. Guano is found also \u2014 among other places \u2014 on the east coast of Patagonia and on the coral reefs of Baker's, Maiden, Howlands, and Jarvis' Islands, in the Pacific Ocean. The Bone Beds, or Coprolite * deposits are strata, mainly clay and calcareous shales, com posed of phosphate and carbonate of lime, as in the Gault and Cambridge green-sands, or, as in the Ludlow Bone Bed and the Lias Bone Bed, composed of the remains of reptiles and fish, either compressed into a rock or, as in so many caverns, covered by stalagmite, or the droppings from limestone, and more or less mixed with earth or sand. Coprolites are the accumulated excrement of animals mixed with the remains of bones, teeth, scales, etc. In Canada, various parts of the Southern States such as South Carolina, Swabia, France, Thuringia, and in England, at the junction of the Rh\u00e6tic and Lias forma tions, these coprolites are dug for the purpose of being manufactured into manure, their value depending on the phosphate of lime which enters so largely into their composition. There is only one reason why guano does not accumulate in other latitudes quite as much as in those named. The cliffs of the Arctic regions, and of the northern and western islands of Scotland, not to mention such haunts of birds as the Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig, are, for a large portion of the year, white with myriads of sea birds ; but their droppings never form more than a thin layer, the frequent rains washing it away. Hence, for the formation of thick beds of guano such as those described, a rainless or, at least, extremely dry climate is essential, and this is exactly what prevails in the regions mentioned. The lower part of Peru is proverbially dry- In the town of Iquique a slight shower falls not much oftener than once or twice in many years, and as three-fourths of the con stituents of guano are soluble in cold water, the very circumstances which make it valuable as a plant food would render it impossible of accumulation in a wet region. Patagonian guano contains much less ammonia (2| per cent), but it has 47 per cent, of phosphates, while the guano of Sombrero, one of the West Guano, a word derived from the old Peru vian word Huano, meaning bird dung, is composed of the droppings of sea-fowl f \u2014 penguins, gannets, cormorants, divers, gulls, terns \u2014 and mixed w7ith the bodily remains of birds and seals. The most important beds of guano are found on the coast of Peru, between 2\u00b0 and 21\u00b0 south latitude. The centre of the guano deposit is \u2014 or was, for it is all but used up \u2014 in the Chincha Islands (Fig. 26), bare rocks rising out of the sea and covered with beds of guano which were in places 200 feet deep. From this group alone 7,000,000 tons, worth about \u00a380,000,000, have been exported. For years, indeed, Peru throve on this national wealth, and to the listlessness engendered of the idea that a nation could * Kopros, Greek for excrement. f A fuller description of this valuable material will be found in the \" Countries of the World,\" Vol. III., pp. 301\u2014309."], [73, "Fig. 26.\u2014 THE GUANO BEDS ON THE CHINCHA ISLANDS, PERU."], [74, "58 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. better known as the \" black lead \" of pencils, though in reality it is simply carbon. It is hard, dark, lustrous, does not soil the hands, and breaks with an irregular, somewhat rounded fracture known as conchoidal, from a fancied resemblance to the curved outline of a shell {concha). There are several varieties of it\u2014 the chief of which is common anthracite, which produces little flame, does not soil the hands, and burns without smoke ; it is superior to any other description of coal for heating pur poses. The largest deposits of it are in North America, in the states of Pennsylvania and Rhode Island ; it also occurs in South Wales ; in England ; near Mons ; in the Tarantaise ; on the Harz ; at Landshut, in Silesia ; and at Schonfeld, in Saxony. Extensive anthracite deposits also occur in China. Indian islands, is purely phosphatic. The entire island is composed of this \" sombrerite,\" which consists wholly of the bones of turtles and other marine animals, coral fragments, &c, which have been cemented into a more or less solid mass by the dissolved droppings of birds. It is used for the manufacture of artificial manure, and if the deposit holds out, there is little doubt that the entire island will in time be removed. The guano of Maiden Island, in the Pacific, is also very rich in phosphate of lime ; and in the caves haunted by bats in Arkansas, Texas, and the Bahama Islands, considerable deposits of guano have been discovered, though, owing to the animals depositing it not being fish eaters, and, in some cases, not even flesh-feeders, the manure obtained from these localities is by no means so rich as that already described. Carbonite, bituminous, or carboniferous coal is black, and soils the hands easily. It con tains 75 to 85 per cent, of carbon, with 10 to 16 per cent, of bituminous matter, f and burns with a light flame. The varieties of this coal are glance coed, which is full of shale ; pitch coal, with a bituminous lustre, brittle, light, and a conchoidal fracture ; and fan coal, or sooty coal, which is less bituminous, with frag ments of wood. The characteristics of coal of these descriptions are manifest, but with regard to glance coal we see that its formation has been effected by constant eruptions, and that many portions of shale have been intercalated with it. No coal is so generally useful as this glance coal, which is capable of being used for various purposes, and gives out, on the whole, nearly as much heat as any other variety. Cannel coed, or candle coal, so called from But of all the organically-formed rocks, the most important are those which constitute the Coed beds. They are, for the most part, the pro ducts of vegetable accumulations.are notoriously combustible, and vary from a brown to a black colour. Mineral coal is essentially carbon com bined most frequently with bitumen or some kind of bituminous substance and more or less earth, which is what is known as the ash that remains behind after the coal is burnt. The difference in composition and texture exhibited by the many varieties is owing to the degree of metamorphism of the original substance.* The first trace of coal is the \" black olonezer earth,\" in the Huronian clay slates (phyllites) on the north-west shores of Lake Onega. According to the account given by Inostran seff, the first variety of this coal is of a black colour, with diamond-like metallic appearance, and consisting of: \u2014 its bright flame, is a highly bituminous mineral coal. It has a waxy lustre, and deep black colour ; it is not brittle, but splits easily.

X The jet found in Whitby and Spain is a hard variety of cannel coal."], [75, "59 ORGANICALLY-FORMED ROCKS. produced from cannel coal is of a very high quality. Hence it is extensively employed for gas- making. The greatest depth of black coal is to be found in the anthracite or Coal Measures, and especially in the Carboniferous formation. The most important carboniferous formations in Austro-Hungary are in Bohemia, in the large coal basin of Schlan-Rakonitz, and at Pilsen, in the Schatzler coal district, and especially in Prussian Silesia and Moravia, in the Ostrau basin, which is one of the largest coal basins known, and also in the vicinity of Jaworzno, in the district of Cracow. Bituminous coal is found at Funs kirchen and at Steierdorf, and at numerous places at the northern foot of the Alps. The three great coal basins of Germany are the upper Silesian coal basin, the Saar coal basin, and the coal mines on the Ruhr. The best coal deposits in Europe are the English. Of these, the greatest is that of South Wales. The Forest of Dean is an outlying portion of this field. North of the Malvern Hills is a straggling patch of coal measures known as the Severn Valley coal fields. The South Staffordshire, the Tarn worth, the Leicestershire, the Derbyshire and York shire, the North Staffordshire, the Lancashire, and the Northumberland and Durham fields, are all more or less important. The Cumber land, the Denbigh and Flintshire, the Cheshire, the Anglesea, and the Somersetshire, are the remaining areas in England. In Scotland, the Ayrshire, the Lanarkshire, the Stirling shire, the Midlothian, and the Fifeshire, are the principal fields. In Ireland, the only beds worked are those of Castlecomer, near Kilkenny, and others between Tralee, Mallow7, and Killarney ; in the north there is a small basin in Coal Island, but it is partly covered by New Red Sandstone strata. in the United States and Canada, there is, in Michigan, a series of coal measures extending over 5,000 square miles. In China there are also enormous coal fields at present almost untouched. Near Pekin the beds which supply the city with fuel are ninety five feet thick, and on the west and north west, south of the great mountain range which stretches across northern China, the area of the carboniferous strata is believed to exceed 100,000 square miles. In India. Japan, Borneo, Labuan, and elsewhere, coal beds are found in greater or less abundance, and in Australia they extend with short intervals from Bass Strait to the Gulf of Carpentaria, the principal mines being near Newcastle, in New South Wales. In New Zealand there are also de posits ; and in various parts of South America, particularly Brazil and Chili, seams have been discovered and worked. Brown coal is of a newer date. It is black or brownish-black, highly bituminous, with the vegetable texture so well preserved that its origin is at once observable. It is not quite so black as the other coals, gives a brown streak, and contains 44 to 75 per cent, of car bon, leaving a large proportion of ash when burned. It burns freely, with a long reddish flame, and is found in several varieties, the chief of which are : \u2014 A black, brittle form, with a vitreous lustre, not variegated, of which the \" Salon \" coal of Germany is an example ; deep (Pech) coal, deep black, brittle, and exhibiting a longitudinal lustre ; common brown coal, that is much mixed with lignite, blackish-brown, with foliations, and a greasy lustre ; lignite, woody brown coal of a brown colour and streak, containing 44 to 57 per cent, of carbon, the proportion of ash being generally very high, and the structure of the mineral indicating a woody texture. Most of this lignite has been derived from the wood of conifers. Indeed, wood under pressure has in the course of two or three centuries been con verted into a substance so like lignite as to be practically undistinguishable. In Germany the brown coal is found at Cologne, Zittau, and other places. In Austro-Hungary glance coal is found at Salesl, near Aussig, in Bohemia ; A large coal basin exists in North America, where the coal fields extend over an enormous area, greater than that of the German Em pire, and, it is unnecessary to say, infinitely more extensive than that of England. The Appalachian coal field alone covers about 60,000 square miles. The Illinois and Missouri basin is estimated to cover an area quite as large, and not to mention many smaller fields"], [76, "60 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. have been felled or have fallen, and been allowed to lie rotting under like conditions. It is thus coal in an early stage of consolidation, just as lignite is vegetation further advanced in the process of carbonification. Sometimes, indeed, the peat, under favourable circum stances, forms so rapidly that the species of plants entering into its composition can be readily detected. For instance, at Alt-Warm briich Moor, near Hanover,* the turf re formed in fifty years, and in thirty years more had attained a thickness of from three to four feet; and much the same observation has been made at Franzensbad, near Eger. In the valley of the Somme three feet of peat are affirmed to have grown in from thirty to forty years, while in the colder climate of Denmark it is reckoned that not more than ten feet have accumulated in nearly three centuries. at Leoben and Eibiswald, in Styria ; and at Tri fail, in Carinthia. Deep coal occurs at Haring, in Tyrol, in the mines in southern Bavaria, and along the north of the Alpine range, and there are mixtures of brown coal and deep coal in the beds of Saaz and Falkenau, in Bohemia. Lignite is found in the Koflach basin of Styria and the Wolfsegg basin of Upper Austria, etc. All these formations belong to the Tertiary epoch. Peat, or turf, may be regarded as the newest of the Coal formations. It is, in fact, coal in process of development, consisting of plants which have died and formed layer after layer, until the result has been a compact felted mass, brown and combustible, often mixed up with the trunks of trees which grew on the site, and with the bones of animals which either fell in the ancient forest or were mired in the swamp which took its place. The peat mosses of Europe have afforded the geologist excellent opportunities for obtain ing data regarding the formation of \" superficial deposits,\" while the antiquary, as has been so admirably demonstrated by the researches of Steenstrup and Englehardt in Denmark, has been enabled almost to recover certain sec tions of unwritten history from the objects preserved in the peat. A wooden bridge, constructed, as the inscription showed, by Germanicus during the German War, about a.d. 16, was excavated from beneath a bed of peat ; and in Galway a hut and a paved pas sage were found under thirty feet of turf, demonstrating, of course, that at the period when these were built habitable ground existed on the spot. Roman roads covered by eight feet of peat are known to the arch\u00e6ologist ; and out of the Dutch mosses there have been dis interred boats laden with bricks ; while canoes with stone weapons are among the most fre quent \" finds.\" In 1833, a house built of oak beams, and evidently \u2014 from the contempora neous tools \u2014 of the Stone period, was brought to light in Drumkilen Bog, in Donegal ; and among the most interesting results of modern discovery is the curious succession of forests which can be traced in the Danish \" mosses.\" The lowest zone of peat contains remains of Sometimes the species have so decayed that no trace of the original outline can be detected. In others it is easy to identify the particular mosses or other plants which have entered into the composition of the turf. In various places a kind of humus or soil is forming, especially where sand or clay has got mixed up with the turf. \" Deep turf\" is usually a black, compact mass, which is characteristic of the lower por tion of the turf beds, and has been produced by the slow deposition of vegetable matter, combined with the pressure of the overlying masses. What the Germans call \" speck-tors,\" is structureless \u2014 that is, it does not exhibit a structure divisible into layers. Bedded turf, on the contrary, is composed of plant remains and analogous substances, is of light or reddish-brown colour, and exhibits a well-marked stratification. Turf has received various names, indicative of the plant from which it is derived, such as moss-turf, grass turf, heath-turf w7ood-turf etc. The laws governing the formation of these great bogs are now tolerably well known. Peat, as we have seen, is made up simply of water-plants which have decayed in swamps undrained and undisturbed through a long course of years, though not unfrequently its accumulation is, in part, due to forests which * Tate : \" Physical Geology,\" p. 99."], [77, "ORGANICALLY-FORMED ROCKS. 61 the Scotch fir, while the upper is marked by the occurrence of the oak. Yet the Scotch fir has never been known as a tree indigenous to Denmark ; and the oak, which took its place, has in turn been replaced by the beech. In the older part of the peat stone implements are embedded, while in the later portions the works of art are bronzes. A long time must, therefore, have elapsed between the date when tne first and the last implements were lost in Aberdeenshire, is, for example, full of trunks immersed in peat. Peat has already formed in the Wood of Drumlanrig, levelled so lately as 1756 ; and the moss of Kincardine, in the upper part of the Forth Valley, owes its exist ence to the dense oak forest which at one time covered its site. In 1651 an extensive forest of dead fir-trees existed in Western Ross-shire ; by the year 1666 a moss occupied the site of the fallen wood ; and in the year 1699 peat was Fig. 27. \u2014 THE IRISH ELK (Megaceros hibernicus). the forest now converted into turf \u2014 evidence, if evidence were needed, of the danger of hasty conclusions regarding the age of any one bog from data obtained by the study of another. The remains of the Irish elk (Fig. 27), wild ox, bear, beaver, red deer, and man, which have been found in so many peat deposits, demonstrate the condition of the country prior to their formation. We know, indeed, that several modern bogs are due to the destruction and decay of forests, aided by the accumulation of water in the hollow ground where the timber was allowed to lie. The Forest of Mar, in regularly cut out of the bog then formed. The primeval forests of Hircania, Ardennes, and Semana, were destroyed by Severus on account of their harbouring the \" Barbarians,\" and several in Britain were felled by order of Par liament because they sheltered wolves and outlaws. Again, the Welsh, in the reign of Edward I., cut or burnt dow7n many of their woods, as the Irish did in the time of Henry IL, for the purpose of harassing their invaders ; and in other districts huge trees, in good pre servation, and with the marks of the axe still visible on their trunks, are frequently dug up."], [78, "OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. 62 comes upon their skeletons and armour. On the other hand, in a turbary off Loch Moira, under eleven feet of peat and one foot of gravel, a skeleton, completely clothed in hair garments, was discovered. Now, as wool was early used in Ireland, the remains thus clad must have been of a very ancient date. Some of the Scottish mosses date from the time of the Roman invasions, and were the consequence of it. The marks of the narrow chisel-like Roman axe have been detected in many instances in the lower tier of stumps over which the peat has accumulated, and in some cases the axe itself has been found sticking in the buried tree. In Pousil Moss, near Glasgow, a leathern bag containing about 200 Roman silver coins was found, and in Annan Moss, near the Roman Causeway, a Roman ornament of pure gold was disinterred. A Roman camp-kettle w7as found eight feet deep under a moss on the estate of Ochter tyre. A Roman jug was taken out of Locher Moss, Dumfriesshire ; and, not to enumerate many similar finds, two bronze vessels were dug up in the Moss of Glenderhill, in Strath aven. The legionaries cut down wide avenues in the forests through which they marched. \" The felled wood was allowed to rot on the surface ; small streams were choked up in the levels ; pools formed in the hollows ; the soil beneath, shut out from the light and air, be came unfitted to produce its former vegetation ; but a new order of plants, the thick water mosses, began to spring up ; one generation budded and decayed over the ruins of another ; and what had been an overturned forest became in the course of years a deep morass \u2014 an un sightly but permanent monument of the for midable invader ! \" Hurricanes might have accomplished a similar work of destruction ; the trees in some of the Scottish mosses being either torn up by the roots, or broken across, and lying all one way* On the Continent turf formation is said to be rare on calcareous, and frequent on sili cious bottoms, though in Ireland the rule does not hold true, probably owing to local circumstances not permitting of the water draining away as easily as it does in a lime stone country generally. It even occurs, according to Portlock, on the summit of some high hills, where a clay bottom retains the moisture. The growth of bog moss being greatest in the centre of a depression, where moisture is most abundant, bogs are usually much swollen in the middle, and go on in creasing till the slope is sufficient to discharge the water, and limit the growth. Examples are cited, by the writer named, where towns once visible from each other, are now shut out from view by the elevation of a turf moss between them. Such bogs are liable to overflow after long continued rains. In Ireland, where about one seventh of the country is covered with bogs \u2014 that of Allen being 238,500 acres in extent, and in many places more than thirty feet in depth \u2014 such mishaps are by no means unfre quent. In January, 1883, after a heavy down fall of rain, several thousand acres in the vicinity of Castlerea were submerged by the \" bursting \" of the neighbouring bogs. Mills were stopped, bridges choked, fields covered to the depth of twenty-six feet, and traffic on the road between Bellingare and Castlerea was suspended by the overflow of a moss, flooded by the rain until it had broken its bounds and begun advancing rapidly towards the town. The bog at Baslick, which \" moved \" some time before, also broke up in several places, and threatened to begin its march on the arable country in the neighbouring lowlands. Such mishaps are, unfortunately, too common in Ireland. In June, 1882, a large bog on the Wistropp Estate, in East Clare, began to crawl It has even been asserted by some anti quaries that few of the British bogs are older than the Roman period. This is, probably, a too sweeping conclusion, for some of the objects found in them may have been en tombed long after the peat had been formed. In 1542 a troop of English cavalry pursuing the routed Scots across the Solway Moss, were swallow7ed up, and to this day the turf-cutter * Miller : \" Sketch Book,\" pp. 8-9. A fully illustrated account of turf and its geological relations will be found in Professor Rupert Jones's paper in \" Science for All,\" Vol. II., pp. 311\u2014348."], [79, "63 ORGANICALLY-FORMED ROCKS. to the south-eastward, carrying before it several patches of reclaimed land planted writh pota toes, and destroying a portion of the main road to Limerick. A few years ago some labourers, working in a field in Galway, heard \" a noise like thunder,\" followed almost immediately, to use their phrase, by \" the country rolling upon them,\" in the shape of the black ooze of a \" moving bog.\" By-and-by the witnesses of this strange sight were driven from the field which they were cultivating ; and before the lava-like stream ceased its progress, two corn fields, a potato patch, and a considerable tract of pasture land was inundated. The bursting of the Solway Moss, more than a century ago, is a case even more familiar ; for this vast morass, saturated by unprecedentedly heavy rains, left its bed and covered four hundred acres of farms to such a depth that several cottages were buried, and a number of others so far entombed that their roofs alone appeared above the dreary expanse of liquid peat. When the inundation ceased, it w7as found that the original level of the bog had in its own area sunk twenty-five feet, and that, in the lowest ground which it had invaded, fifteen feet of turfy substance had been deposited. Again, in 1831, a bog of one hundred acres, between Bloomfield and Geevah, in Sligo, burst, and, in addition to covering a large extent of arable land, cut up the ground into deep ravines, and carried away the road from Bloomfield to St. James's Well, for a distance of 9,200 yards. The reclamation of peat bogs has always had keen interest for the speculative land im prover, though his success has rarely been sufficient to account for the enthusiasm wdiich the subject has evoked. In Scotland and Ireland small tracts have been recovered : but all the world knows the fate of Mr. Roscoe, who, after displaying his sagacity as a states man and historian, wrrecked his fortune and his reputation for shrewdness in trying to make a farm out of Chat Moss. Even the Bog of Allen has had attractions for dreamers over this description of Herculean labour. Some times the upland \" moss scalps \" or \" hags \" shrink and dry up, by the water \" seeping away ; \" and occasionally it is possible during the summer months to evacuate them by cutting trenches, through which the black ooze drains. But wise men leave peat bogs alone as objects for agricultural experiment, though as materials for the instruction of the geologist and the physical geographer they are worthy of even more space than can be bestoAved on them. Asphalt, or bitumen, is a black or brownish black substance, which, when at its firmest, is not unlike coal, and breaks w7ith a bright conchoidal fracture, but at its softest it is a thick, viscid, tar-like mass. It melts at a low temperature (212\u00b0, the boiling-point of water), and bums with a reddish smoky flame. It is due to the decomposition of animal and vegetable matter, and may be regarded as one of four changes which, under certain condi tions, organised matter undergoes. The first is in being converted into naphtha, the second results in petroleum, the third in mineral tar, and the fourth is this asphalt \u2014 the whole of these four substances merging by invisible degrees into each other, and being probably of the same chemical composition. Naphtha in some localities flows out of the earth in a clear, colourless stream. When it takes up oxygen from the air, it becomes brown and thick, and is known as petroleum, which is only limpid after purification. Further oxi dation and evaporation convert it into mineral tar, and by-and-by asphalt is the final result of the chemical changes going on. o o o In other parts of Ireland the furrows of what were once ploughed fields have been found underlying bogs, and in Donegal, the remains of an ancient plough and the wattles of a hedge were discovered six feet below the surface, which, like the house in Drumkilen Bog already referred to (p. 60), were over whelmed by some such catastrophe, though history is silent regarding the event. In all peat bogs there is a considerable amount of iron, or limonite, formed either by diatoms, or derived from the decomposition of the iron pyrites, which assists in the preservation, in a black, hardened form, of the oak buried in the turf."], [80, "64 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. numerous islands abounding in tropical ver dure.* The name \" asphalt \" is derived from the \" Lacus Asphaltites,\" or Dead Sea, and, like the \" bitumen of Jud\u00e6a,\" another common designation for this subject, expresses the popu lar idea of its origin. In reality very little is now found near the Dead Sea, though the Foun tains of Is, from which ancient Babylon was supplied, still yield all that is required by the inhabitants of that region. Asphalt stone, a porous Secondary and Tertiary limestone \u2014 found in large quantities near the Val de Tra vers, in Switzerland ; in the neighbourhood of Syssel, in France; in Lobsau, in Alsace; in Limnier, near Hanover; and at Holle, in Hol stein \u2014 is even more valuable. It derives its name from the fact of its being impregnated with asphalt to such an extent that it is ex tensively used for pavements and other places where dryness is a desideratum. Ozokerite, or mineral wax, is red or green ish-yellow, and is extensively used for the manufacture of candles. It is another form of the series to which asphalt belongs, and is abundant in some parts of Galicia, near Drohobycz and Boryslav for example. As a \" rock,\" in the geological sense, as phalt is found in many parts of the world, and though not characteristic of any particular period, it exists in the older formations in a state of the greatest purity. Considerable quan tities are obtained from Cuba, under the name of \" Chapapote,\" or Mexican asphalt ; and that of Caxitambo, in Peru, is noted for its purity and high lustre. In Great Britain it appears, as in West Lothian, in the joints of sand stone, and is no doubt due to the destruc tive distillation of the associated coals and coaly shales by intrusive igneous rocks. In the flagstones of Orkney and Caithness its presence may probably be traced to the decay of the ancient fishes which are found so abundantly in these rocks. But it is in the West Indian Island of Trinidad where asphalt appears in the greatest abundance. The \" Pitch Lake \" is 99 acres in extent, and of unknown depth. Coursing over the surface are numerous rivulets, and every now and again the asphalt wells up in a soft condition, accompanied with a discharge of sulphuretted hydrogen gas. These viscous emissions, however, soon harden by exposure to the air, and, like the rest of the lake's surface, become hard enough for any one to walk across. In the neighbouring country there are also detached patches of asphalt, and the fragments cast upon the adjoining shore are proofs that at certain points the sheets protrude under the sea. South of Cape La Brea is a submarine volcano, which occasionally boils up and discharges a quantity of petroleum. On the east side of the island there is another, which throws masses of asphalt upon the contiguous shore. The Pitch Lake does not, however, seem to have been much disturbed in modern times. Throughout its circumference of one mile and a half it is firm enough to bear a waggon, though still somewhat plastic, and appears to be in motion towards several points which act as vortices, as the trunks of trees disappear and emerge at some distance from the point at which they sink. It seems also to have sub terranean communication with the sea. Yet small fresh- water lakes and streams swarming with fishes are distributed over the surface, with Petroleum is a much more important devel opment of the same order of \" hydrocarbons,\" and is even more extensively distributed, though the deposits at Baku, near the Cas pian, and in Pennsylvania, United States, are those which are greatest in extent and most celebrated. Though known in the latter region for many years, it was not until the year 1859 that its pumping took anything like active shape. Then crowds of adventurers began boring, cities rose like mushrooms, and in the course of a few years or months immense fortunes were made or lost by those who had \" struck oil,\" or had failed to \" strike \" it, or whose wells ran dry as suddenly as they had begun to flow. Petroleum occurs in all geologi cal formations from the oldest to the newest, * Peckam's \" Monograph on Petroleum and its Pro ducts,\" in the Tenth Census of the United States, Vol X. (1884), is a treatise practically exhaustive of the subject. See also the works of Humboldt, Vertenil, Gumilla, Alex ander, Sainte-Claire Deville, and Wall ; and, for an account of the Pitch Lake, the graphic description in Kingsley's \"At Last : A Christmas in the West Indies \" (1874)."], [81, "ORGANICALLY-FORMED ROCKS 65 though its principal development is in the in these shales being chiefly vegetable.

At the same time, as the Silurian rocks lie below the coal-beds, it is not quite easy to re concile this destructive distillation of coal and shales with the actual circumstances of the case. Vegetable mould is a mixture of the remains origin, few chemists of much eminence now holding the hypothesis that it owes its pre sence to chemical action.

Hence arise the different varieties of soil, its composi tion and consequent fertility largely depend ing on the character of the mineral matter which makes up the rock upon which it rests, and of which it is for the most part the worn-down material. The thickness of the soil will also be regulated by the steepness of the ground from which it accumulates in a valley : along the side of a hill it is swept down not only by its own gravity, when it is not, tenacious, but by the action of the wind, ram, and melting snow. The character of the soil is, however, altered by its being mixed with the decayed residue of the plants which grew on the surface ; this residue, if rank, forms in time humus or vegetable mould. In some instances this is small, while in others, where the land is remarkably rich, as in the Black Earth Region of Russia, it will amount to as much as 12 per cent. Worms bore in and out of the mass in search of organic matter in the soil, and then venting the earthy ma terial on the surface, add no small amount of finely triturated matter to the slowly gathering mould. Darwin, for example, noted in his researches on this subject, that du ring twenty-nine years worms had deposited six and a half inches of castings on a single field. In centuries, at the same rate, the accumulation must have an important geo logical significance. In the Tropics, the de cay of vegetable humus is of course more speedy than in the colder North. Its de composition and conversion into soil are ex pedited by the overflow of rivers, and the mixture of mud and other alluvial deposits amongst it. Hence occurs the richness of \"river bottoms,\" and, it may be added, of drained swamps when the decaying vegeta tion has not been converted into peat. of the earth is always reasserting itself. When any spring is charged with mineral matter, which it has dissolved out of the earth, it deposits a portion when the waters rise to the surface, owing to the evaporation and the escape of carbonic acid gas, &c. The limy matter thus deposited is shown by the white incrustation which forms into pendant masses in places like the roofs of caves, or the under surface of the arches of bridges built of limestone, or even when the water perco- lating through plaster washes out some of the lime. In all limestone deposits the stream and the rain have a tendency to hollow out caves, and form stalactites on the roofs of the caverns, those of the Rock of Gibraltar, of the Island of Antiparos, in the Greek Archipelago, the grotto of the Demoiselles in the Depart- ment of the Herault in France, the grottoes of Arcy, in the Department of Yonne, those of Osselles in Franche-Comte, the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, the Alabaster Cave of Cali- fornia, the grottoes of Adelsberg, the Rocca grottoes of St. Canzian, in the same region, etc., being excellent examples (Figs. 28, 29). When the droppings from the limestone fall on the floor and rise in a calcareous mound, they are known as \" stalagmites,\" and if the sheet covers the floor it is called a stalagmitic sheet. This form of covering is found at the bottom of many caverns, and has been the means of preserving unsuspected, until the limy mass hag broken through, the remains of man and other animals which have lived in these caves, been buried there, or have crept thither to die. Springs charged with carbonate of lime thus produce \" calc-tuff\" or \" calcite,\" in the form of \" calc-spar,\". and hot springs leave their solid matter in the form of aragonite. Calc-tuff is usually porous, though sometimes it is sufficiently firm to be used in building, being valuable for its lightness. Chemically-formed Rocks. \u2014 Though these are of less importance than the others, several are of some economic value, and a number of great geological interest. \" Stalactites,\" or the icicle-like bodies which hang from the roofs of limestone caves or similar situations, are among the methods by which the crust Travertine is similar to this calc-tuff', though it is usually more compact, hard, and semi crystalline.

At the springs in question models are immersed in the water, and the carbonate of lime being deposited on them in a solid form, stone casts are in this manner easily procured. than salt, though it is not often found in such massive beds. Silicious tufa, or sinter \u2014 the latter being a firm the former a porous mass \u2014 is a de posit from hot springs which contain much silica or flinty matter in solution. The hot springs of Iceland, and the geysers of that island and of New Zealand, and of the Yellowstone country in America, are excel lent examples of these, as we shall see wdien we come to describe the various geological agents engaged in making and remodelling the earth. Immense deposits of silica have in this way been laid down, the silica being, most probably, as in Iceland, dissolved out of the lavas below, and is held in solution as a hydrate by the alkaline carbonates and sulphates. Bunsen observed that no silica is precipitated on the cooling of the water. It is only after its evaporation that the silica is deposited in a thin film on the moistened sides of the vessel. In the Azores, also, there are several such springs, though in no case are they so marked as in the regions mentioned. Gypsum, plaster of Paris, or sulphate of lime, is in its compact form known as ala baster. It occurs as a rock in the form of beds, rarely of any great extent, and in masses or accumulations irregular in form and usually in combination with rock salt, clay, and anhy drite, which is simply gypsum without the water inherent in the latter. It is also found in the form of veins and detached pieces in the masses of other rocks, and is of frequent occurrence in most clays in the shape of iso lated crystals or nests. Selenite, again, is merely transparent gyp sum, just as satin-spar is its fibrous form. It is found in clays, and is undoubtedly a deposit from a watery solution. Bog iron, or limonite, is a \"rock\" only in the geological sense \u2014 that is, it forms part of the materials entering into the composition of the earth's crust. When springs, or other water, charged with iron are allowed to settle, they discharge a brownish or red scum of peroxide of iron on their banks or at the bottom of ponds and marshes. In time these form masses of iron ore, which are known as \"bog\" or \" marsh ore \" (p. 63), and when sand or gravel gets mixed up with it, this variety of ironstone is sometimes called \" sand iron.\" Tangled masses of mineral have sometimes been known to have been abstracted from the solution by a diatom \u2014 a microscopic plant covered with a delicately sculptured flinty case \u2014 called Galiionella fer ruginea. In Sweden these masses of bog iron are found at the bottom of the great lakes. When the lakes are ice-bound the ore gatherers go out \" prospecting \" in search of this \"malm.\" They first of all make small holes in the ice, through which they pass a pole long enough to reach the bottom, which is generally at no great depth, as the ores are The formation of this mineral is very rapid, sulphate of lime being produced by the action of sulphuric acid derived from the decom position of iron pyrites \u2014 the \" diamonds \" of roofing-slates \u2014 on carbonate of lime. From the circumstances in which gypsum usually occurs, it is supposed that it is a product of the local conversion of limestone either by the action of gases or b)7 infiltration. It is, how ever, certain that some deposits of gypsum owe their origin to the evaporation of sea water. The sea contains about sixteen times as much salt as it does gypsum, but the point of .saturation for the latter being reached much sooner than that for the former, the gypsum requiring only 37 per cent, of water to be removed, while the salt demands 93 per cent., the gypsum must always be deposited before the salt. It is also possible, as Mr. Jukes-Browne points out, for the deposition of gypsum to take place without the point of saturation for rock salt being reached. Hence, it more frequently occurs as a mineral deposit"], [84, "68 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. isting in the earth's crust. Perhaps, also, the presence of sulphur crystals show7s that it might have been formed in water through the decomposition of sulphuretted hydrogen, as sulphur melts at 2381\u00b0 Fahr. In Sicily, Spain, and other localities, it has been formed by the decomposition of gypsum (sulphate of lime, or calcium-sulphate, as the latter-day chemist would say), and, strangely enough, the sulphur thus made by weathering is in certain localities becoming converted into sulphuric acid, or oil of vitriol, which, when limestone is present, re-forms gypsum, or \" borscale,\" which in Sicily is looked upon as a sign that sulphur is underneath. collected among the shallows and reed-beds. By long practice the collector knows whether or not there is ore at the bottom, and when he settles this point he stakes off his \" claim \" with pegs driven into ice. Then making an opening sufficiently large he passes through it a sieve fixed to the end of a pole, which rests on the ground. Into this riddle he rakes the ore, and empties it on the ice. In 1860 about 22,000 tons of ore were collected in this fashion, and the beds, which vary in thickness from eight to thirty inches, after being ex hausted are said to be renewed in about twenty-five years. Bog-iron ore is also found at places now covered by the sea. For ex ample, Nordenskjold tells us, the shells of crabs and pebbles dredged up in the Kara Sea are often surrounded by incrustations of bog iron. This also occurs over an extensive area north-east of Port Dickson, near the mouth of the Yenisei, a Siberian river, in such quantity that it might be used for the manufacture of iron were this part of the world less inacces sible. This fact is not surprising, since the shores of the Arctic Sea in this region bear every sign of having been alternately elevated and depressed. The general theory held re garding these lacustrine ores is that the}7 are the ferruginous deposits washed down into the lakes by rivers from the surrounding country. But Herr Sjogreen attributes them, as did Ehrenberg, to minute organisms ex tracting the iron from the water in which it is held in solution. The presence of phos phoric acid in bog iron ore, which renders it unfavourable for smelting, is due to the decay of these organisms in it when forming. All mineral veins may be regarded as chemically-formed rocks, though, as they are for the most part veins running through other beds, we may more conveniently consider their origin when we come to discuss the nature of these important tenants of rocks, both stratified and unstratified. Recent researches have, however, gone far to render possible the assertion of Nordenskjold and others, that a large portion of the earth's constituents may be of cosmic origin \u2014 that, in other words, in the course of ages the distant stars and other heavenly bodies may have contributed of their substance to thicken the crust of our world. For example, at various times, and in various places, there has been collected from the snow a black powder containing metallic iron, and, in some instances, cobalt and nickel, while on the \" inland\" ice which covers Greenland a peculiar mineral powder, named kryokonite, mixed with grains of metallic iron, has been detected. This dust consists of small, angular, double-refracting crystal fragments, without an)7 mixture of particles of glass, and is, therefore, very diffe rent from the glass-dust that is commonly ejected from volcanoes. From these and similar data Nordenskjiild ventures on the assertion that not improbably, if this dust falls in an equal amount all over the globe \u2014 and though the snow enables it to be detected more easily than on earth, there is no reason for supposing that it does not \u2014 something like half a million tons drop from the celes tial spaces in the course of a year. The Sulphur is found in great beds in Iceland, Sicily, and in the vicinity of volcanoes gene rally, and in the environs of Rimini there are beds contained in a calcareous marl, varying in thickness from four to thirty-one feet. It is due to the oxidation of the sulphuretted hydrogen, which is discharged in great quan tities along with the steam issuing from the vents, known as \" solfataras,\" found so abun dantly in nearly every volcanic district. Or it may arise owing to the decomposition of sulphates and other minerals previously ex-"], [85, "Fitf. 30.-THE FALLS OF THE ANIO AT TIVOLI, NEAR ROME."], [86, "70 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. of the strata being from 90 to 170 feet in thickness. The Marston Mine is excavated to a depth of 16 feet over an area of about 40 acres, the roof being supported on huge pillars of the native rock left at stated intervals. In this neighbourhood, owing to the dissolution of the salt by the infiltrated rain-water, the ground is sinking in many places, to the great damage of the superin cumbent buildings. In some localities the brine rises to the surface, in others it is pumped out, but it forms almost as rapidly as it can be evaporated for the sake of the salt held in solution. But for the most part the salt of commerce is derived from the iron stained solid blocks, which are subjected to various refining processes before the material appears on the table. In the province of Galicia, in Austria, there are masses of rock salt computed to cover over 10,000 square miles. Already the workings are said to ex tend for a distance of 30 miles, and in places the salt has been hewn away to form large halls 100 feet in height. In Asia, America, and Africa, there are also numerous deposits of salt, sometimes pure, at other times mixed up with clay and other materials which have originally been deposited with it. shooting stars must discharge an immense quantity of those luminous particles. For hours at a time we see them falling ; and w7hen we remember that this has been going on during unnumbered geological ages it is not impossible to regard it as an important factor in the history of our planet. In brief, it may be found \" that a considerable quantity of the constituents of our sedimentary strata, especially of those that have been deposited in the open sea far from land, are of cosmic origin, and will throw an unexpected light on the origin of the fire-hearths of the volcanoes, and afford a simple explanation of the re markable resemblance which unmistakably exists between plutonic rocks and meteoric stones, namedy, by showing that the principal material of the plutonic and volcanic rocks is of cosmic origin, and that the phenomena of heat which occur in these layers depend on chemical changes to which the cosmic sedi ment, after being covered by thick terrestrial formations, is subjected.\" * Without quite homologating this idea, it is certain, as we shall learn more fully when this section of our theme comes to be discussed, that mete oric, or native, iron is \u2014 and has from the remotest ages been \u2014 falling on the earth's surface from the immeasurably distant regions outside of our atmosphere. These accumulations do not belong to any special geological period, and, indeed, from the way in which they seem' to have been formed, no necessity exists for their connection with particular epochs. Here and there, as at Vienna, springs deposit a fine powder, which consists of gypsum and muriate of lime, and in Russia several lakes overflow their banks and deposit a saline crust. In Egypt, carbonate of soda has in this manner been deposited in great quantities, and the extensive turf moors of Franzenbad, near Eger, in Bohemia, are partly covered with a coat of Glauber's salts (sulphate of soda) and sulphate of iron, derived from the springs which form the principal attraction of that watering-place. In that tract of the Pampas of South America, known as Las Salinas, forty leagues are strewn with beds of nitrate of soda mixed with gypsum, common salt, Glauber's salts, and remains of recent; \u2014 that is, non-fossil \u2014 shells. Some salts But perhaps the most extensive and at the same time best known chemical rocks are those made of rock salt. They form extensive masses, \" lenticular \" (lentil-shaped), usually in clayey deposits, and are always accompa nied by gypsum. Salt also forms an ingre dient of some clays, and in small quantities is found in limestone. In England the most extensive deposits are in the New Red Sand stone of Cheshire, underlying the bed of the Weaver. There are also deposits in Wor cestershire, Staffordshire, and several of the northern counties, and in County Down, though none of them supply more than a frac tion of the amount derived from the Cheshire beds, which spread over an area 30 miles in length, and from 10 to 15 in breadth, some * Nordenskjold : \" Voyage of the Vega \" (1881), Vol. I., p. 331."], [87, "CHEMICALLY-FORMED ROCKS. 71 form efflorescences in rocks. As examples of these, the nitrate of soda (saltpetre) found in the limestone caverns of Brazil and Ceylon might be named, while the \" alkali \" of the Central North American plains is derived from the soil in which it is contained. The deposits of crude nitre in the Atacama deserts, and the borax deposits in California and other parts of the world, are specimens of crystalline matter which have been left on the surface after the lake or other water in which it was originally dissolved had evapo rated. waters of the sea. In both countries, the salt lakes occupy shallow depressions on the plains ; in both, the mud on the borders is black and fetid ; beneath the crust of common salt, de posits of sulphate of soda or of magnesia occur, imperfectly crystallised ; and in both the muddy sand is mixed with lentils of gypsum. As these circumstances, apparently so trifling, occur in two distinct continents, we may feel sure that they are necessary results of common causes. % The rock salt of England bes above the beds of magnesian conglomerate in the New Red Sandstone series of the great marshy plains of Lancashire, Cheshire, and Worcester shire. It is found at different depths, in beds ranging from a few feet to about 120 feet in thickness. No fossils occur in the salt, and it is usually of a reddish colour, owing to the presence of particles of iron rust. Sir Andrew Ramsay considers that there is no doubt that these salt beds were due to precipitation from supersaturated salt lakes, by the action of solar heat on the water of salt lakes which had no outflow, like the Great Salt Lake of Utah for example, or the salt lakes of Central Asia and of the Sahara. That salt forms an ingredient of certain rocks may7 be readily un derstood when it is taken for granted \u2014 an as sumption which will presently be proved \u2014 that all sedimentary beds have been laid down under the action of water. Indeed, at the present moment extensive regions, especially those at the mouths of rivers, are, after being deserted by the water, rapidly passing through the stages of salt marsh and fen-land. Many such tracts exist in Holland, in the ancient Gulf of Poitou, in the filled-up estuary of Flanders, and so forth, and when the Zuy7der Zee \u2014 which, again, occupies the site of old lakes \u2014 will be shut oft' from the German Ocean and drained, its soil must necessarily be heavily impregnated with saline matter. In a similar manner, no doubt, the deposits of salt have been formed. To take one example out of many which could be cited : before the Suez Canal was dug, the surface of the Bitter Lakes was much below the level of the Red Sea, and the evaporation of these waters had produced a bank of salt 1,600 acres in extent, composed of layers two to ten inches in thick ness. It would appear that these \" lagoons \" * had been inundated from time to time by the waters of the Red Sea, while, in the interval between these incursions the evaporation and concentration were sufficient to precipitate a layer of salt, and so in time the large deposit above mentioned was accumulated.f In the \" limans \" of Bessarabia, on the Black Sea, which dry up in the summer, salt beds are growing before the eyes of any one who chooses to watch the process. Again, Mr. Darwin, in speaking of the salt deposits of South America, notes that it is remarkable that all the circumstances connected with the salt lakes in Siberia and Patagonia are similar. Siberia, like Patagonia, appears to have been comparatively recently elevated above the * This familiar word is from the Italian \"laguna,\" and means a shallow salt-water lake, or sheet of water, almost or entirely cut off from the sea by an intervening strip of beach.

Meantime, what has been presaged regarding rocks which are igneous, plutonic, or unstrati fied, and those which are neptunian, aqueous, or stratified, may be considered as holding good throughout the earth's crust. It is evident from what we have learned re garding the character of the strata or beds, of the stratified rocks, that all have, more or less, been deposited under the action of water. They are all \" clastic,\" or fragmentary, if we except the chemically-formed beds, and, to a certain extent, those which, like coal, are formed by the decay of vegetation, or, like chalk, are composed of the shells of forami nifera. That is to say, they have- been de rived by the wearing down of pre-existing rocks. But even the partial exceptions which we have mentioned come more or less into this category also, since, mingled with them, are beds of detrital matter in some form or other. These derivative rocks may be com posed of gravel, sand, or mud, brought down by rivers, and deposited in the sea or lake into which the river flows. Or the winds may have swept the sand into great dunes, such as we see on the shore or in the deserts of Africa and Asia ; or, as we find in volcanic tuffs, they have come from the materials vomited forth by volcanoes ; or, as in the case of the glacial clays, have been formed out of the debris ground off' the underlying rocks by the glaciers which moved over them. In very ex ceptional cases it happens that though such materials are in beds, water has not played its assorting part in re-arranging the substances. This, however, almost invariably holds true of very recent deposits, since there is scarcely a foot of the ancient earth which has not been at one time or other under the sea. It is, therefore, unnecessary for the purposes of the physical geographer to take these very spe cially into consideration. When we speak of volcanic and ice action, all that is necessary will be said of their influence geologically. Taking a simple example of how strata might be laid down by one of the means specified, let us suppose a great river pouring into the sea. It would deposit first, let us say, a bed of mud, derived from the wearing away of its banks, then a bed of gravel might be laid down, or sand might follow this, and so on ; or all these might be mixed together, the strata on the bottom of the sea, or on that of the lake into which the river flowed, being en tirely dependent on the character of the pre viously-formed strata with which it came in contact during its course. By the pressure of the superincumbent beds, or by the infiltration of lime or other connecting material, or the action of heat, these deposits would in time get consolidated. They would also, neces sarily, contain the remains of plants and ani mals which had been embedded in the mud or sand, though the extent of preservation of these \" fossils \" will of course depend, first, on their hardness, and, secondly, on the degree to which the soft particles of their structure are replaced in the process of fossilisation by the harder ones of the material in which they are embedded. Thus, most shells will remain intact, while soft-bodied animals will, so far as their fleshy particles are concerned, entirely disappear. As we have seen that there is every probability, from what the late deep-sea dredgings have brought to light, that few, if any, of the beds of rock were originally de posited in the greatest depths of the sea, it"], [89, "UPHEAVAL AND IRREGULARITY OF BEDS. 73 necessarily follows, from the great thickness of the sedimentary strata, that they must have undergone many changes since they first began to be laid down. The fossiliferous strata of Europe have been calculated to be some four teen miles in thickness, and even at one single place it is not uncommon to see several hun dred feet of beds exposed, without taking into account those which are partially con cealed from view. Most probably, therefore, as the shores of many continents are at the present day oscillating, these vast beds of strata have been gradually deposited while the sea-floor on which they are laid has been sinking. That they have taken very long periods to be deposited we know, since the fossils contained in the lower ones are often very different from those preserved in the upper ones, the lapse of time serving to admit of the missing species dying out of existence. Hence the oldest rocks in the earth's crust contain an altogether different collection of animal and vegetable remains from those which are of later date. It is also equally clear that, whether laid down in deep or in shallow water, the beds have been elevated since their forma tion. This is proved by the fact that strata with marine shells are found on the tops of mountains which bear no trace of ever having been the floor of the deep sea. The older geo logists explained this phenomenon by saying that the sea had retreated ; but the sea never retreats locally, while we shall learn by-and by that there are parts of the world where, in modern times, the earth is sinking, and others in the close neighbourhood where it is rising. but south of Lake Wetter, in Sweden, there are very ancient rocks of Silurian and Cam brian age, which are as horizontal as if laid down yesterday, though, doubtless, ages must have elapsed since they were first slowly raised from the bottom of the sea. Again Table Mountain, in the Cape of Good Hope. though 3,500 feet in height, and composed of old strata, is, as its name expresses, almost if not quite flat. This, however, is not often the case. On the contrary, as a glance at any railway cutting or sea-cliff will show, the strata are usually sloping, in some instances absolutely on end (Fig. 31), now and then curved, and occa- Fig. 31. \u2014 ALMOST VERTICAL STRATA, The beds show \" over-lapping,\" thus proving that superposition is not a true test of age ; in this case the beds which on the surface seem uppermost, being iu reality the undermost. sionly perfectly7 reversed. From the presence of certain fossils in the beds, we ascertain that these have in places an alternation of marine and fresh-water beds, and even of rocks, some of which must have been formed in shallow and some in deeper water. Thus, if it is a cause for amazement to see marine shells far above the sea-level, it is still more astonishing to sink in a few feet through beds where the alternation of the strata shows that an estuarine deposit was succeeded by those formed in the true sea, and the sea by a lake, and the deep water again by shallows. For example, in sinking through the stiff' London clay which underlies so much of the Thames valley7, we come first on a clay of marine origin, then at a depth of several hundred feet on shallow water and fluviatile sand ; finally, be neath this comes the white chalk, which must have been formed in a much deeper sea. Indeed, the chalk is about the only rock which there is any evidence of having been formed Upheaval and Irregularity of Beds. What is more, the beds after having been laid down and consolidated must have under gone violent disturbances. If they had not, they would be at this moment perfectly7 level, since, of course, they could not \u2014 except in very exceptional cases \u2014 have been deposited in a sloping position, and without any breaks or dislocations. In Sicily there are beds some 2,000 feet in thickness which might be de scribed as of this nature. They are of com paratively recent date in geological history7,"], [90, "74 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. in mid-ocean. In taking soundings in the Atlantic, the lead brings up a limy ooze which bears a strong resemblance to the ancient chalk. But Sir Wyville Thomson, when he formulated the dictum that we \" were living in the Cretaceous period,\" uttered a paradox, rather than a truism. The Atlantic ooze is in many respects different from the ancient chalk. The one is made up almost entirely \u2014 so far as the limy material in it is concerned \u2014 of the debris of the shells of foraminifera, but, ac cording to Mr. Sorby, many of the minute particles which make up the mass of the chalk have been derived from the decomposition of various other shells. Foraminifera form a very important constituent, y7et other larger cal careous organisms \" have probably yielded the greater part of the rock. It is, therefore, very far from being identical with the Globisserina ooze * of our modern deep oceans, though there is an interesting connection between them.\" There is more silica in the ooze than there is in the chalk, while the amount of car bonate of lime in the latter is greater than in the former, though the deeper the samples are taken the nearer it approximates in compo sition to the chalk. We may, therefore, ven ture to conclude that the beds of chalk were deposited at a considerable distance from land, and probably7 in comparatively deep water. which it forms a part, have been, to use a familiar term, thrown out of joint. It is therefore necessary, before considering the modern forces now at work, which might in the past have produced these and other geological changes, to examine the principal ways in which rocks lie in the earth's crust. Syncline and Anticline. \u2014 We have already intimated that it is rare to find strata perfectly horizontal. They slope at every angle from the slightest tilting to a position in which the beds stand perfectly upright. Such vertical strata were found, among other places (Fig. 31), in the rocks on which Powis Castle is Fig. 32. \u2014 DECEPTIVE ANTICLINAL BEDS. In reality beds were originally overturned into the shape of an arch, after whicli some of the beds have had their tops removed. built, and in the Grampians, where beds of conglomerate and sand alternate ; but as the egg-shaped pebbles of which the conglomerate is composed stand on end, it is clear, other These elevated rocks, containing sea-shells and other evidence ofthe materials out ofwhieh they are composed, having, therefore, been laid down at sea-level, must have been raised to the position they now occupy. Still more clearly are we led to the conclusion that siuce the stratified rocks were first formed in the manner indicated, violent forces have been at work in the earth's crust, when we see the rocks not only raised high above the sea-level, and twisted and tilted in every degree, but dislocated in various ways. We follow, for example, a bed for a certain distance, then sud denly it ends abruptly, the remainder having slipped above or below the level of the other portion. In other words, it has been broken in such a manner that it and the strata of Fig. 33. \u2014 FOLDED BEDS, SOME OP WHICH HAVE BEEN REMOVED. reasons apart, that, as eggs do not naturally stand on their ends, the pebbles must. have originally been deposited Avith their largest axis parallel to the plain of bedding, and been afterwards raised into the position they now occupy, by the strata of which they form a part having been tilted vertically. The chalk and other beds at Alum and Whitecliff Bays, in the Isle of Wight, are also almost verticaL Sometimes the strata by pressure have as sumed a more or less curved shape, and in not a few instances they are actually doubled on each other, not unfrequently in several bends ; which circumstance, the upturned edges of the different beds having been examined * The Biloculina mud of the Norwegian explorers of the North Sea."], [91, "CURVED AND FOLDED BEDS. 75 without our obtaining any clue to the cause, is apt to lead to a mistake, the duplications of a single bed appearing as if there were several beds. Indeed, a bed will sometimes double up and down in this w7ay for miles, so that the strata appear like a series of the which, did we not detect the arrangement de scribed, might lead us to believe that the two A A*. \u2014 Anticlinal crest, nr saddle.

When the strata incline towards each other like the two legs of a V, they are described as \" synclinal ; \" if the contrary is the case, as in the inverted /\\, the beds are described as \" anticlinal.\" Or this relation of bed to bed may be illustrated by means of a book : let it lie flat on the table, then the leaves will represent strata in a per- fectly horizontal position ; place it on end, then the beds are vertical, as in the rocks described (p. 73 and Fig. 41) ; open the book a little in the middle, and then the leaves on each side of the opening will represent syn clinal strata ; turn it over, so that the book will lie with its edges on the table, then the boards sloping away from back are examples of anticlinal strata ; finally7, if several books all partially open are arranged in a line, but some with their backs on the table, and some with their edges, they will in a rough fashion show the mode in which strata are often found in the earthy crust. Curved and Folded Beds. \u2014 In examining the crust of the earth more critically7, we find that the arrangements are not always so simple as this. The strata have not only been doubled, but they have been reversed in great arches, the tops of which have been cut off by the weather, or other agencies acting on the surface. The diagrams (Figs. 32, 33, 34, 35) show some of these results, where the same bed appears twice, and in a position were different beds and of different ages. They are, however, only \" isoclinal,\" or folded"], [92, "76 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. strata sloping all in the same direction. These sections also explain some other facts regard ing the disposition of strata. the true dip is exhibited, and then, to use the words of Lyell, \" holding the hands immedi ately before the eyes, and placing the fingers of one in a perpendicular, and of the other in a horizontal position. It is thus easy to dis cover whether the lines of the enclosed beds bisect the angle of 90\u00b0 formed by the meeting of the hands, so as to give an angle of 45\u00b0, or whether it would divide the space into two equal or unequal portions. 'You have only to change hands to get the line of dip on the upper side of the horizontal hand.\" On the other hand, the strike is the prolon gation of the strata at right angles to the dip I in other words, it is the direction of the strata. It must, therefore, always be in an opposite direction (Fig. 37). Thus, if the beds dip to It may be added that in some strata the plication becomes so extreme that the beds are crumpled, corrugated, or puckered to such an extent that it is difficult or impossible to follow the course of the folds. Contortion of the kind we have described is mainly found in the newer rocks, while the oldest ones are most dislocated. Dip and Strike. \u2014 This leads us to explain what is meant by \" dip \" and \" strike.\" Dip is the inclination of the strata from a horizontal position, and the steepness at which they slope from the horizontal is described as so many degrees to the east and west, or whatever may be the direction. There being 360\u00b0 in a circle, a vertical set of rocks would stand at an angle of 90\u00b0, while those which slope half way between the horizontal and the vertical would be marked as possessing a dip of 45\u00b0, and so on, as their inclination was greater or Fig. 37.\u2014 DIP AND STRIKE. st.\u2014 The Strike, vf.\u2014 The Dip. the east, their strike must necessarily be north and south. Thus having ascertained the dip, we can easily enough fix the direction of the strike. But the converse of this does not hold good, for strata dip in different directions ; hence there are two lines of dip to every line of strike, so that strata having a strike running from north to south, may dip either to east or west. These facts Sir Charles Lyell has illustrated by comparing dip and strike to a row of houses running east and west, \" the long ridge of the roof representing the strike of the stratum of slates, which dip on one side to the north and on the other to the south.\" A still easier mode of illustrating these elemen tary facts may be found by manipulating a book. Place a book on the table with the edges of the leaves downward, and the back of the book upwards. If one side of the cover is moved a short distance, the cover so moved will represent the fine of dip, while the back T Fig. 36. \u2014 THE GEOLOGIST'S COMPASS WITH CLINOMETER ATTACHED.

This is measured by an instrument called the clinometer, which is usually a little plummet attached to the compass used for geological surveying (Fig. 36). Or it can be noted with sufficient accuracy for ordinary purposes by standing opposite to a cliff where"], [93, "DIP AND STRIKE. 77 of the volume will exemplify the line of strike. If the cover of the book is extended only in a slight degree the dip will be proportionately steep ; if the cover be opened farther, so that the book lies nearly flat on the table, the dip will be proportionately less.* It will some times happen that the strata having been elevated into a dome-shaped protuberance, the summit of w7hich has been carried away, the ground-plan exhibits the edges of the strata forming \" a succession of circles or ellipses round a common centre.\" These circles are, of course, the line of strike, and \" the dip, being always at right angles, is inclined in the course of the circuit to every point of the compass,\" constituting a \" qua-qua-versal dip,\" that is, a dip turning any way. Such beds have been termed \" periclinals,\" and a great many technical expressions are used by7 geological surveyors to express the different ways in which they show themselves, though for our purpose it would be superfluous to trouble the reader with this vocabulary7. originally succeeded each other. Indeed, it is not unknown in the history of stratification to find a series of beds absolutely inverted (Fig. 34), that is to say, they have been so dis turbed that the oldest, \u2014 namely, the lowest beds \u2014 have got turned over, and being upper most might be supposed to be the newest. This may arise from a variety7 of causes, one of the most frequent being that the beds are first bent into folds, and these, by7 a second tilting, are thrown still farther out of their original position. Outcrop, escarpments, outliers. \u2014 The ap pearance of the edges of strata at the surface is known as their \" outcrop \" or, as the miners say, the \" basset,\" while the line along which the upper surface of a bed of rock rises out of the ground is styded its \" line of outcrop.\" When strata terminate abruptly, as in cliff's, they form \" escarpments,\" which, if very steep, are known as \" mural \" or wall-like escarpments. When beds of rock lie isolated from the principal masses of the same strata, of which they have evidently at one time formed a part, they are called \" outliers.\" In such cases there are almost certain to be evidences of some agency which has resulted in the continuity of the beds having been broken, either by7 dis rupting them, or more frequently by the removal of those which are now represented by the gap. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to point out the importance which the dip and strike have in mining operations, for on the steepness of the angle at which the beds incline to the horizon will depend the ease or difficulty of working them. If they7 suddenly dip down at a sharp angle, the \"prospector\" may have -to sink a very deep shaft to reach them, or possibly7 find it difficult to get at them at all. On the other hand, if they incline very little from the horizontal, he ma)7, mole-like, burrow along their continuation without requiring to sink shaft after shaft, each one deeper than its pre decessor, until, in time, the coal, let us say, escapes him altogether, or, still worse, until he knows in what direction the beds are dipping. It often happens, of course, that the edges of inclined or bent strata appear on the surface, and when they have been smoothed by the wearing away7 action of rivers, rain, ice, or other agency, we can easily observe the succession of beds, though, for the reasons already men tioned, errors may arise as to the number of Separate strata and the order in which they7 Conformability and unconformability.\u2014 When beds have not been so violently dis turbed as to become reversed, we have a right to conclude that the undermost ones are the oldest, and the topmost the newest, geologi- Fig. 38. \u2014 IDEAL SECTION SHOWING HOW THE EYE MAT BE DECEIVED BT STRIKE AND DIP. The strata a dip alongside the mountain in one direction at an angle of about 45\u00b0 from the horizon. Those marked b, on the other side of the mountain, seem to dip at the same angle and in the same direc- tion. In reality this is not the case. Owing to the weathering being the same on both sides it is the strike which is exposed at b. cally speaking (Fig. 38). When the one on the top lies prone to the one under it, like * Richardson's \"Geology and Pal\u00e6ontology,\" edited by Dr. Thomas Wright, p. 147."], [94, "78 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. period \u2014 long, even as geological time goes must have elapsed. This is still more evident when the under series of beds exhibit marks of having been elevated subsequent to their subjection to the subterranean force by which they were thrown off the horizontal, of their having been worn by aerial agents when a dry-land surface, and then, of course, of having been buried under the sea to admit of the deposition of the beds which lie unconform able with them. It even happens that the two books lying the one on the other, the beds are called \" conformable \" (Fig. 39). But we find beds lying, say on the upturned edges of others, like books laid on the upper edges of upright ones, then these strata are said to be \" unconformable \" (Figs. 40, 41). Such appear ances are by no means uncommon. They are exhibited in many places, among others at Siccar Point, near St. Abb's Head, in Ber wickshire, where the Old Red Sandstone lies in a sloping position on the edges of the vertical and arched Silurian schists ; * or at Frome, in Somersetshire, where Sir A. Geikie figures the inferior Oolite lying horizontally on the inclined Carboniferous strata. Again, at Cullen, in Banffshire, the same distinguished geologist has sketched a double unconforma bility \u2014 viz., the Old Red Sandstone lying on \" quartzite,\" and gravels of a much more recent date resting, in their turn, unconformably on it. Lastly, not to multiply examples of a common arrangement of strata, a good in stance of unconformability is figured by Jukes from a section near Thomastown, Kilkenny ; it may be added that the newer and older strata composing the mountains of the Vienna Forest are unconformable with each other. Unconformability is, of course, a proof of a break in the geological succession. In other Fig. 40. \u2014 UNCONFORMABLE STRATA. Those at b have been tilted up before those marked a have been deposited either in contiguity to them (though at a very different dip) or, per- haps, on their upturned edges, from which they have subsequently been removed by weathering. underlying strata are disjointed and dislocated in the fashion we shall presently see without the upper ones being in any way acted on in a like manner. In this case the lapse between Fig. 41. \u2014 UNCONFORMABLE STRATA. The beds u have been deposited after the beds & and c have been tilted up. the two sets of beds must presumably have been greater than when the difference of angle is less, and can only be detected when a large extent of country is surveyed. In strata, the greater unconformability and the greater dis cordance between the two beds or series of beds the greater the likelihood of the one being much older than the other, or vice versa. Fig. 39. \u2014 CONFORMABLE BEDS. The strata are not necessarily of an approximate age. But as 6 lies exactly on a below it, it is clear that a was not tilted out of the horizontal before the material of which b is made up was laid down over it. Both sets of beds must have been upheaved at the same time. words, as the same convulsion could not have tilted one set of beds into a vertical position and permitted those lying on them to remain more or less horizontal, the under ones must have been laid down and tilted up before the uppermost ones were deposited on their up turned edges or other surface lying at a different angle. Hence there is every ground for con cluding that between the two events a loner Overlap is a term employed to express the fact that one bed extends so much farther than \u2022 ihat immediately below as to conceal its edge. This disposition of strata may have been occa sioned either by the river which brought down the material out of which they are composed, having a greater amount of volume at a later than an earlier period, so that the sediment Avas deposited over a wider area than before ; or, * These beds are figured in Lyell's \"Elements,\" p. 71 (Eig. 78)."], [95, "OVERLAPPING, FALSE BEDDING RIPPLE MARKS. 79 it has been suggested, overlapping may be due to the1 fact that the sea bottom has been raised up, and again depressed without disturbing the horizontal position of the strata. In this case the newer strata may rest for the most part conformably on the older, but, extending farther, pass over their edges. The overlap ping beds then stretch farther and farther out as the lower ones gradually subside, gener ally with a slope. It does not therefore follow that overlapping beds need be unconformable. Indeed, the term is strictly7 applied to con formable beds. But as not unfrequently there has been a slight derangement or wearing away of the underlying beds before the newer ones were laid down, Sir Charles Lyell only ex presses a conclusion which is irresistible when he states that every intermediate step between unconformable and overlapping beds may and does occur. Overlapping may also occur when strata are partially curved (Fig. 31), though this artificial form of overlapping is easily detected. It is also self-evident that if the possibility of overlap is not taken into accoimt, a prospector boring, let us say, for coal, may entirely miscalculate the thickness of the upper set of beds. Again, as Mr. Jukes- Browne has pointed out with great clearness, the vast sums of money which have been thrown away in search for coal in the central districts of England might have been saved had the miners been aware of the manner in which conformability and unconformability may interfere with their calculations. Here the Coal Measures rest unconformably upon the ancient rocks called Silurian, and are themselves unconformably overlaid by newer deposits of Sandstone and Conglomerate. In Antrim, again, where the Trias or New Red Sandstone rests on the Carboniferous rocks, it has been thought that if once the Sandstones are pierced, the Coal Measures will be reached. But if the one lies unconformably on the other, it may happen that while in one locality the Trias rests upon the Coal Measures, in other places \" it may he upon any of the beds which come out from beneath the Coal Measures ; and from the structure of the district it appears that the chances are something like twenty to one against the Coal Measures being found under any particular spot of the Trias.\" * False Bedding occurs when the strata are not exactly superimposed in beds, each resting evenly on that below. They may be diagonal, or in various other ways different from what ordinarily prevails, this appearance being, no doubt, due to eddies in the currents by which the beds were originally laid down, or in the sea, on the bottom of which they were deposited, the same divergence from the rule being often noticed in modern sandbanks or the extensive accumulations of mud which form at the mouths of modern rivers. Another irregularity of bedding is produced by what the miners know as \" rolls,\" \" swells,\" or \" horses' backs,\" and \" wants.\" The two are exactly the opposite of each other. A roll, swell, or horse's back consists in a portion ofthe lower bed being protruded out of its due place into the one which lies over it, though it is in other respects quite regular ; while a want is where a place has been scooped out of an underlying stratum, and filled with the material out of which the one lying over it is composed. Ripple Marks, etc., on rock beds are a series of wavy ridglets, such as are seen on the beach just after the tide has retired, and may reason ably enough be attributed to the same cause operating on the ancient sea-shores. They7 are confined to certain sandstones and sandy shales into which mud enters largely. If a beach on which such ripple marks had formed was per mitted to bake or harden, it would not be difficult for another lay7er of mud or sand to be deposited over it without effacing the first impressions. In like manner, even the marks made by passing showers have been preserved, and, as we shall see by-and-by, the trail of sea snails, the burrows of worms, and the foot prints of birds and other animals, have in this manner left their records on the rocks. Dislocation of Beds. It is extremely rare to find any of the rock beds in the earth's crust which have not been more or less disturbed since first they were * Jukes-Browne : \" Handbook of Physical Geology,\" p. 389."], [96, "80 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. laid down, and, in all likelihood, every age of the earth has witnessed more or less disturb ance either by volcanic forces having been at work, or by7 earthquakes having riven the strata which compose its crust. The form of disturbance which will, however, form the theme of the present remarks is that exhibited in \" faults.\" thoroughly understand the geology of the dis trict, to imagine that the shifted fragments of the dislocated seam are in reality several beds, and thus spend much time and money only in the end to reap disappointment. Sometimes, especially in soft rocks, the line of fault is tolerably clean cut, but in hard beds, the edges of the shifted strata are rough and broken, with pieces of the disrupted rocks jammed into the crack. Often the fault is undulating ; occasionally it is straight, and at various angles from perpendicular to forty five degrees or less, and though it may consist simply of displacement of strata, as in Figs. Faults. \u2014 A bed or series of beds are often found dislocated. The continuity of the strata has been broken by one portion of them having been shifted up or down, so that in following out a seam of coal we come sud denly to a point where it terminates, and one Fig. 42. \u2014 DOWN-THROW.

In the one case the fault is reversed ; in the other it is regular. of sandstone takes its place ; or in tunnelling along a bed of limestone we come as un expectedly on one of shale, without either bed exhibiting any symptoms of thinning out or coming to a natural termination. We then know that there has been, as the miners say, a \" hitch,\" or a \" down-throw,\" or \" up-throw,\" as the case may be, and to search for the lost stratum we must bore down, or probe, the beds at another level (Figs. 42, 43). 42, 43, it is easy to understand how it might be complicated by the softness or hardness of the broken beds, by various local circumstances, or by the strain from the subterranean motion which caused the original dislocation reacting repeatedly on the shifted beds. Hence faults form an important branch of geological study. The throw or amount of displacement pro duced by a fault is measured by the vertical distance between the two ends of the broken bed. This displacement may vary from a few feet to many hundreds, or even thousands, so that in juxtaposition may lie the broken ends of beds of widely different ages. The inclination of the fault is known as its \" hade,\" or underlie, and this inclination has a cer tain relation to the direction of its \"throw.\" For example, the fault generally, as in Fig. 42, \" hades \" under the beds thrown down But it occasionally happens that the fault is a Thus a fault is not really without its advan tage to the miner. It often enables him to reach beds which would otherwise be less ac cessible. Moreover, when the crack is filled up with foreign matter it serves as a kind of wall, which checks the progress of a sire along an entire coal bed, and acts as an embank ment which prevents the too rapid flooding of a mine. But where there are several* faults (Fig. 44), the prospector is apt, unless he"], [97, "DISLOCATION OF BEDS. 81 \"reversed\" one, that, as in Fig. 43, \"hades\" under the \" up-throw \" ones. great as many of those with which we are acquainted. The Runn of Cutch, in the delta of the Indus, is a familiar example of a region which has suddenly subsided, and near New- Madrid, in Missouri, a similar depression fol lowed a series of shocks. On the other hand, elevations, equally sudden, have resulted from similar causes. These depressions and elevations could scarcely have been caused without the beds underneath bein? either bent or ruptured ; while the terrible disturb ances by which Krakatau, in the Strait of Sunda, near Java, was destroyed in 1883, and others of scarcely less importance with which the last few years have acquainted us, were forcible enough to shatter almost any thick ness of strata. Sometimes these dislocations are not only very deep, but extend over an immense extent of country. A fault in Virginia has been traced for more than eighty7 miles in the same direction as the foldings of the Appalachian chain* and Yon Decken has described one in the southern part of the Carboniferous zone of Liege and Hainault, that extends from the Prussian to We are not, however, concerned with faults to a greater extent than the degree in which they affect the exterior of the globe, and alter the beds of which it is composed, with the result of giving an impress to the scenery7. They may, in this way, form cliffs and valleys, though the wearing-down action of the ele ments gradually smoothes off the irregularities thus formed. It may happen that the two series of displaced beds \u2014 the down-throw and the up-throw \u2014 are separated by a considerable distance, and the crack between them be tilled up not by debris, but by mineral de posits. Such \" veins \" will be considered in another chapter. Or if the rocks are hard, the ends of the broken beds may be polished smooth by rubbing against each other in being shifted up or down. Such an appear is known as \" slickensides.\" It has some times been seen when the thick wall of a house has been cracked by an earthquake and the two sides abraded against each other without the stones being actually displaced.

That these were to a great extent the same subterranean forces which have twisted and bent the strata in the manner already seen (p. 75) need scarcely be doubted. Indeed, within the memory7 of the present generation, there have been earthquakes and volcanic dis turbances sufficient to cause faults quite as Joints. \u2014 At the point where one bed comes in contact -with that lying above it or below it, there is, as might be expected, a well-marked line of separation. But in addition to these lines of lamination, there are others which * Rogers : \" Geology of Pennsylvania,\" p. 897 ; Suess : \u2022\u2022 Das antlitz der erde \" (1883). 6"], [98, "82 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. cut across the beds, at right angles to their planes of deposition, and to the horizon and each other, in addition, at all angles. These cracks are called \"joints.\" They are of im mense benefit to the quarrymen in raising blocks of stone, which without them would require to be laboriously cut through, as they have a tendency to divide all rocks into square-shaped or cuboidal pieces. These joints can be very well seen in a block of coal. The surface which formed the line of lamination is generally dull, and readily soils the fingers ; the cracks at right angles to these are more cleanly7, and go by the name of the face. the slyne, or the cleat, in the dialect of the particular district. These divisional planes are no doubt caused by the same action which we see going on when the clay at the bottom of a dried-up pond cracks by contraction in drying. They are also seen in unstratified rocks, like Trap and Granite, and in such cases may be regarded as hav ing been caused by shrinkage in the course of that cooling from a molten state, which such masses have undergone. Sometimes these rocks are so jointed-like, they7 crumble down like starch into cuboidal or prismatic fragments. CHAPTER IV. Unstratified Rocks : Central Heat : Various Forms of Unstratified Rocks.

Hitherto we have been considering rocks more or less arranged in regular beds, and in many cases containing the remains of plants and animals which existed during the time they were laid down. These \" fossils \" enable us to determine approximately if not their actual, at least their relative ages. But the foundations on which all these rocks eventually rest are others of a massive character, in which no trace of stratification can be detected, nor anything in the shape of a fossil be found. Sometimes they form huge shapeless masses rising up into cliffs or hills, and at other times they con stitute wall-like veins and branches throuarh the rocks lying above them, showing that they were originally molten, and had, during some eruption, burst in that condition through the stratified beds. In such a case we can fix to some extent the period of this eruption, though it is perhaps unnecessary to say that this is only in a geological sense, not in a significance which the ordinary chronologer would recognise as at all precise. Such rocks we have already learned to recognise as Ig neous, Plutonic, or Unstratified. Granite and \" Trap,\" in their numerous developments, are examples of this great series. The modern lithologist, aided by the chemist and the microscopist, has divided and sub divided these rocks into endless varieties, to which endless names have been applied. For our purpose something much simpler, if less determinate, will suffice. But before describing the chief forms of these igneous rocks, it may be well to say a few words regarding the source from which they are all but certainly derived, namely, the interior of the earth. At one time it was almost universally held that the centre of our globe was a sea of molten matter, on which the hard surface, which we know as terra firma, was superimposed in the form of a thin shell, which bore to the liquid interior much the same proportion that the rind of an orange does to the pulpy matter within it."], [99, "TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH. 83 This view is now gravely disputed. The main facts which have been ascertained regarding the temperature of the unexplored interior of the earth may therefore be briefly stated. at a much shallower depth in other regions, there must exist not only warm but even molten matter, is shown by volcanoes vomiting forth ashes, lava, and steam ; by the hot springs which rise to the surface in so many parts of the earth ; and still more accurately by the observations made in the numerous borings for wells and mines in different parts of the world. Everywhere, after we pass through the narrow zone which is influenced by the varying temperature of the seasons, the heat increases, never diminishes, as we bore into the earth ; though, owing to various local cir cumstances, this temperature is not uniform all over the world, or even in a limited dis trict. Observations in mines, owing to the lights and the presence of human beingr. emitting warmth, are not always to be de pended upon. But, taking the mean of a great many data, the increase of temperature is now generally agreed to be about 1\u00b0 for every 64 feet in depth. From the tables out of which this generalisation has been formed, what are called isogeotherms, or lines of equal underground temperature, have been drawn (Fig. 45). These lines follow, for the most part, the contour of the surface, but are not quite so steep. \" Their flattening,\" according to Everett, \" increases as we pass to lower ones, until, at a considerable depth, they become sensibly horizontal planes. The temperature gradient is consequently steepest beneath gorges, and less steep beneath ridges.\" The Interior of the Earth. The temperature of the atmosphere is due not only to the heat of the sun, which it has been ascertained penetrates in places to a depth of over 101 feet, but to the temperature of the earth, derived from certain reservoirs of heat at a depth beyond which the miner has not as yet reached. The upper beds of the earth exhibit a very uniform temperature, the warmth from internal sources which they lose by radiation being compensated for by what they gam from the sun's temperature, or, as it is called, insolation. At a depth of from five to seven feet the difference between the cli mate of summer and winter is not marked. In tropical countries like Java it is reached at half that depth, while in middle Europe there is at a depth of from 80 to 112 feet an almost uniform state of the thermometer throughout the year.* In Germany the surface beds, at a depth of 82 feet, have an average temperature of 4820\u00b0 Fahr. In the Arctic regions, Siberia, for example \u2014 where these observations have for the most part been taken \u2014 there is scarcely any variation in the annual temperature. For more than half the year the surface of the earth is frozen to a considerable depth ; then (hiring the short summer it is thawed to a depth sufficient to enable a sparse vegetation to grow, whde the soil a few feet down is still congealed, as it has no doubt been for ages. In Siberia, in the valleys more especially, it is not uncommon for frozen soil to be found at from 260 to 300 feet, and at Yakutsk (latitude 62\u00b0 2' N.) it extends to 620 feet, though no modern cold could have affected the earth to this depth. This increase of temperature is, however, not always uniform. In the Rose Bridge Col liery, for example, the temperature rose for the first 558 yards at the rate of 1\u00b0 for 577 feet ; in the next 257 yards at the ratio of 1\u00b0 in 482 feet, while in the lowest portion of 432 feet it is 1\u00b0 in 54 feet. The probable reason for these variations may7 be sought for in the different powers of different rocks to conduct heat, the lighter and more porous rocks con veying heat less readily, while the dense and crystalline ones offer less resistance to its passage. In boring the artesian well of Gre nelle, near Paris, it was found that when the temperature of the air was 51\u00b0'34, that ofthe water at a depth of 94 feet was 53\u00b0'6, while Temperature of the Earth. \u2014 That, how- ever, beneath the frozen soil in the North and * These observations were made in 1(171 by Giov. Cassini, on the temperature of a cellar at the observatory of Paris, and in the year 1 783 Lavoisier made experiments which show that at the depth of eighty-nine feet the thermometer indicates 530C Fahr."], [100, "84 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. ineffective observations already noted exist for estimating the degree of heat in the centre of the globe. But when we see molten matter thrown up, we know that whatever the depth from which this came the heat must have been enormous. Of late years, however, physicists have come to the conclusion that it is not at all certain, or even in accord ance with known laws, that the nucleus is of molten material. The main argument in favour of the centre being liquid is that, if the ratio of increase of heat w7ith depth con tinues as we go downward, at fifty miles in the interior the temperature must be 4,600\u00b0, or sufficient to melt almost any7 substances with at 1,802 feet it rose to 82\u00b04. The artesian well from which the fountains in Trafalgar Square, in London, are supplied may often be noticed steaming on cold days ; and in one sunk in Kentish Town, in the north of London, the temperature at a depth of 1,100 feet is 69\u00b0'9, or at the rate of 1\u00b0 for every 54 feet of descent into the bowels of the earth. At Sperenberg, near Berlin, a series of observations in a boring to the depth of 4,172 feet, for the most part through rock salt, gave at 3,390 feet an in crease of 1\u00b0 for every 51 J feet. Altogether, taking the different data as yet accumulated into account, it will be seen that they vary so much that the average Fig. 4-5. \u2014 ISOGEOTHERMS IN THE INTERIOR OF A MOUNTAIN. I., II., III., the isogeotherms. 1, 2, 3, the atmospheric isotherms. descent for every degree runs all the way from 297 feet up to 596, and even in one doubtful case to 65 feet* though the mean already given may be accepted as the true one, the observations in the various Alpine tunnels not materially altering the conclusions arrived at from data obtained from the sources indi cated. They have, however, established the fact that, as is shown in Fig. 45, the iso therms, or lines of equal temperature along the side of a mountain, follow tolerably closely7 those of the rocks of which it is composed, though, of course, the figures are not in both cases the same. which we are acquainted or which are vomited out of volcanoes, while the existence of a thin skin or crust is necessary for the formulation of a reasonable theory of earthquake shocks. Tlie late Mr. Hopkins, Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), and others, however, hold tbat the globe is solid throughout, with or without fluid spaces or cavities at irregular intervals, on the ground that were the crust less than 2,000 miles in thickness, the influence of the sun and the moon in producing tides is so great that it would yield to the strain, and be subject to periodical alterations in form similar to those wrhich we see producing oceanic tides. Sir WilliamThomson therefore concludes that the earth is on the whole more rigid than a continuous globe of glass of the same diameter, while Professor George Darwin, after investi gating the subject on the same lines, is of opinion that \" no very considerable portion of the interior of the earth can even distantly Theories regarding the Interior. \u2014 It is thus plain that there must exist in the in terior of the earth a very high temperature. What this is cannot- be clearly decided, since no means more precise than the comparatively * Hann : \" Zeitschrift der osterreicheschen Gesell schaft fur Meteorologie, 1878,\" p. 21."], [101, "THEORIES AS TO THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH. 85 approach the fluid condition.\" Finally, a third theory has been broached by Mr. Fischer, by7 which it is attempted to find a middle course between these opposing doctrines. In this hypothesis \u2014 for theory is, perhaps, not quite the exact term to apply to it \u2014 the centre of the earth is admitted to be solid, but between this and the upper crust is a \" magma \" or semi fused or liquid layer. In other words, as Sir William Dawson has so aptly popularised it, \" the earth may be compared to a stone fruit, such as the plum or peach, somewhat dried up. It has a large and intensely hard stone or kernel, a thin pulp made up of two layers, an inner mass dense and dark-coloured, and an outer one less dense and light-coloured. These constitute the under crust. In the pro cess of drying it has slightly shrunk, so as to produce ridges and hollows of the outer crust, and this outer crust is cracked in some places, allowing portions of the pulp to ooze out, in some of these its lower dark substance, in others its upper and lighter material. The analogy extends no farther, for there is nothing in our withered fruit to represent the oceans occupying the lower parts of the surface, or the deposits which they have laid down.\" William Dawson* and the conclusions he draw's from the data given, are, so far as they bear upon our study, as follows : (1), The nucleus of the earth \u2014 to use a convenient expression \u2014 is probably solid and of great density and hardness, while the under-crust is plastic or liquid. (2), This plastic sub-crust is not in a state of dry igneous fusion, but in that condition of aqueo- igneous fusion which arises from the action of heat on moist substances, and which may either be regarded as a fusion, or as a species of solution at very high temperature. This we learn from the phenomena of volcanic action, and from the composition of the volcanic or plutonic rocks, as well as from various chemical experiments, t (3), Where rents or fissures form in the upper or solid crust \u2014 our terra firma so called \u2014 the materials of the lower crust are forced up wards by the pressure of the self-supported portions of the former, giving rise to volcanic phenomena either of an explosive or quiet. character, as may be determined by contact with water. The underlying material may also be carried to the surface by the agency of heated water, producing quiet discharges. It may also be observed that explosive volcanic phenomena, and the formation of cones, are, as Prestwich has well remarked, characteristic of an old and thickened crust ; quiet ejection from fissures and hydro-thermal action may have been more common in earlier periods and with a thinner over-crust. (4), The contrac tion of the earth's interior by cooling and by the emission of material from below the over- This interior sub-crust is regarded as not perfectly homogeneous, but is considered cap- able of being roughly divided into two layers or magmas, as they have been called. The upper of them is \" highly silicious or acidic,\" of low specific gravity, and light-coloured, and corresponding to rocks like granite and trachyte. The lower is more dense, less sili- cious, more basic, and more highly charged with iron ; so this corresponds with such igneous rocks as dolomites, basalts, and other lavas of a similar kind. Curiously enough, the discovery by Baron Nordenskjold of native iron in Greenland basalts affords some grounds for believing that the inner magma is in part metallic. Much of the Greenland basalt is impregnated w7ith particles of iron. But Nordenskjold's great blocks, which he at first regarded as meteoric, were found at Uivfak, on Disco Island. Andrews also found small particles of iron in British basalts. This theory of Fischer has been adopted by Sir * 1 1 formed the basis of his Presidential Address to the British Association in 1886, and from his lucid remarks much of our summary has been taken. In addition to Hopkins, Thomson, and George Darwin, wLo maintain the solidity and rigidity of the earth on astronomical grounds. Hennessy, Delaunay, Newberry, and Airy, havt discussed the question, and arrived at different conclusions, while Barnard and Crosby. Dutton. Le Conte, and Wadswortb. have taken up the question in America. Dtirocher has elaborated the theory of ''Magmas.\" though long before the period when any of the authors mentioned wrote, John Phillips gave the first inkling of the idea in his \" Manual of Geology \" (1855), pp. 493. 564. + Daubree : \" Etudes Synthetiques de Geologie Esperi mentale\" (1879); Tilden and Shenstone : Philosophical Transactions, 1884; Crosby: Proceedings of the Boston Society ofNatv rai B:istory,188S ; Newberry, Science.

Arago puts the thickness of the crust at 22 miles; Humboldt reckoned it at from 8 to 10 geo graphical miles ; Elie de Beaumont at 28 miles ; and Lyell at 34 miles. Cordier, on the other hand, estimated it at from 64i to 148 miles, while, as we have seen, Hopkins considered the globe as, for the most part, solid, the minimum thickness of the crust being in his opinion not less than from 800 to 1 ,000 miles. But whatever opinion is entertained, it is yet clear thatsome part of the earth \u2014 whether the central regions or cavities here and there in the crust, or that more mythical sub-crust with its two magmas \u2014 must be in a fused condition. This is evident from the liquid and heated materials ejected by volcanoes, and from the fact that in every case these materials are identical with those which fonn one great section of the unstratified rocks. To melt these rocks requires, we know from experiments, a temperature of from 3,500\u00b0 to 5,500\u00b0, so that the central heat must be at least as high as this (p. 84). Beyond this it would be idle in a work of this nature to go, and merely puzzling to narrate all the doctrines which have at different times been held, or are still held in individual instances on this much discussed question. One geologist, for example, argues that the molten centre of the globe must be composed of iron, the residue of the endless \" meteoric stones,\" which dropped into it in those remote ages when it was liquid, an hypothesis which has gained ground, though not precisely in the direction indicated by this author, from the discovery of large masses of iron (p. 85) in basalt. crust, has caused this crust to press downward, and therefore laterally, and so to effect great bends, folds, and plications ; and these, modi fied subsequently by surface denudation, con stitute, as we have already indicated (p. 33), a certain class of mountain-chains and conti nental plateaux. Such lines of folding have been produced more especially where thick sediments had been laid down on the sea bottom. Thus we have here another apparent paradox, namely, that the elevations of the earth's crust occur in the places where the greatest burden of detritus has been laid down upon it, and where consequently7 the crust has been softened and depressed. Yet Bonney has w7ell shown that an amount of contraction, almost inappreciable in comparison with the diameter of the earth, would be sufficient to produce this description of mountains ; and that as the greatest mountain chains are less than eoo of the earth's radius in height, they7 would on an artificial globe one foot in diameter be no more important than the slight in equalities which might result from the paper gores overlapping each other at the edges. These, in few words, are the conclusions at which the majority of physicists and geolo gists have arrived regarding those portions of the earth which we can never reach, and which there is little hope for believing we shall ever be able to learn anything about except by inference. As will be seen, the theories differ widely. But this difference of opinion only demonstrates how indecisive are the facts from which the theorist has to reason, and how science, even when mathematics comes to the aid of geology, will sometimes yield, as an American satirist has remarked with as much truth as- humour, \" a large return of hypothesis for a small investment of fact.\" Be this as it may7, there need be no manner of doubt that the unstratified rocks are de rived from the molten matter. In form they differ widely7. Numerous names have been applied to the different varieties, owing to the .difference they show in chemical composition, and in the arrangement of the minerals of which they are composed. But, for the pur pose of the physical geographer, they may be broadly divided into (1) the Granitic and (2) If this is a fair exposition of the state of belief regarding the interior of the earth, the views which are entertained on the subject of the earth's crust must be equally vague, since the conclusions must entirely depend on what estimates are made as to the rate of cooling of the molten nucleus, or indeed whether the primeval world was ever a molten ball. Numerous estimates have been made, thousrh"], [103, "THE GRANITIC ROCKS. 87 the Trappean series. Ofthe one granite is the type ; of the other the ordinary greenstone, or the various rocks of that nature which are known as \" Trap,\" may be regarded as good ex amples. Under these heads, therefore, we shall find little difficulty in saying all that need be said concerning the unstratified or igneous rocks. Granite, moreover, enters largely into the features which make up scenery. Firm and unyielding, except to the long-continued action of the weather, granite cliff's have a tendency to keep these forms whenever they take the shape of cliffs, the softer beds which have been upreared in time wearing away, unless when hardened by contact with the molten intrusive mass from below. Yet owing to the poverty of the soil, produced by the decomposition of the elements of granite, the regions in which it prevails are on the whole dreary, being for the most part devoid of wood, and when in the shape of moorlands, even more hopelessly barren than such tracts usually are. In many cases it forms bosses and huge rounded hills, with, as Dr. Page very justly remarks, little regularity of outline.so that the granitic scenery is more monotonous than that of the trappean rocks, owing mainly to the fact that while the latter are quite as unyielding to the weather, so far as decomposition is concerned, they break off in endless cubical fragments, always ex posing fresh surfaces to the air, and thus giving to cliff's of this rock that stair-like appearance which has suggested for the principal member of the series a name derived from the Swedish trappa \u2014 a stair. The Granitic Rocks. Every one knows granite by name, and ex cept to the inhabitant of the flat plains and low deltas it can hardly fail to be familiar by sight also. It forms the material out of which so many monuments are constructed, roads paved, and important buildings reared, that specimens of some of its varieties, especially the grey and red, can be seen in almost every street, in even the most remote country towns. The Grampians are composed of it, and the city of Aberdeen is, for the most part, built of this long-enduring rock. The mountains of Cumberland, Devon, and Corn wall, the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland, the Alps of Switzerland, the Dovrefields of Norway, the Pyrenees of Spain, the Ourals and Himalayas of Asia, the Andes of South America, the Abyssinian Mountains of Northern Africa, the central chain of the great island of Madagascar, and the hills of Damara Land, in South Africa, are all composed of granite, or have been materially affected by its intrusion among the sedimentary rocks which lie above it. In piers, and docks, and lighthouses, granite plays an important part ; and even when decomposed, the Kaolin or China clay, composed of the silica and alu mina which enter into the composition of the granite of Cornwall and Devon, forms an important article of commerce. The potter seeks the felspar for the manufacture of the finest crockery and other objects, and the manure manufacturer the apatite or crystal lised phosphate of lime traversing it in veins, while among other products associated with granite \u2014 not to include many \" accessory \" minerals \u2014 mica, meerschaum, cairngorm (or the amber-coloured varieties of rock-crystal), asbestos, beryls, and other Oriental stones, may be mentioned. Still, from its widespread occurrence and durability, granite enters extensively into the formation of some of the noblest scenery of the world, from that of the sublime Andes to the widely7 different \u2014 but, notwithstanding, strangely impressive \u2014 wilds of Dartmoor and the neighbouring Cornish country. On its shoulders rests, as on a framework, a vast array of strata of different ages, though it is for the most part associated with the oldest class of sedimentary rocks. Yet, in the Pyrenees it penetrates beds of the same age as chalk ; in Saxony one of its varieties overlies the chalk at Weinbohla ; in Ireland a like relationship is detected ; and among the earliest observa tions of Mr. Darwin was one to the effect that the granite which forms veins through some of the strata of the Andes must have been fluid as late as the Tertiary period, since it has contorted and altered the beds with which it came into contact. Mont Blanc and Mont St"], [104, "88 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. Gothard are mainly built up of granite. The high Tatra of the Carpathians owes its majesty to the same rock. The Riesengebirge, the Erzgebirge, and the Karlsbad, as well as the Fichtel Mountains, the Bohemian Forest, and the Harz, are also granite. But some of the most notable granite scenery is that supplied by the magnificent Yosemite Valley, which forms one of the chief attractions of the Sierra Nevada of California The granite pinnacles and domes of the highest Sierra opposite Owen's Lake are fine, but the Yosemite, with its lofty cliffs and -waterfalls, is generally admitted to form the grandest of the Western landscapes. The Yosemite Valley Professor Whitney describes as 3,950 feet above the sea, and hemmed in by cliffs ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 feet in height. But what distinguishes it from all other known valleys is, first, the near approach to verticality of its walls ; secondly, their great height not only abso lutely, but as compared with the breadth of the valley itself ; and, finally; the small amount of debris at the base of these gigantic cliffs, the fact being due, as we have seen, to the re sistance of granite to weathering of the kind which so speedily crumbles a sloping \" talus,\" as it is called, at the foot of trappean cliff's like those of Salisbury Craigs, so well known a feature of Arthur's Seat at Edinburgh. The \" Pohono,\" or Bridal- Veil Fall, just in front of the Cathedral Rock, the first conspicuous object in proceeding up the valley, is about 3,000 feet high ; and on the other side is the Tutucanula, or \" El Capitan \" cliff, an almost perpendicular mass, 3,300 feet above the level of the valley (Fig.46). Then come the Cathedral Spires, two slender columns of granite, and, two miles higher up, the groups of peaks to which the name of the \" Three Brothers \" has been given. The highest of these is 4,000 feet in height, and more than 8,000 feet above the level of the sea, and standing over against the group is a cluster of chffs, one of which, 3,000 feet above its base, has been called the \" Sen tinel Rock.\" \"The Dome,\" 4,150 feet high, is another remarkable granite cliff in this singu lar delL Nor are the waterfalls one whit less extraordinary. The Yosemite Creek, in de- scending from the cliff's on the north side, leaps over precipices, in one case with a ver tical drop of 1,500 feet. The Nevada, or Merced Falls, of the Merced River, which flows through the whole length of the valley, are wonderfully grand, the latter having a per pendicular height of 639 feet, the river de scending more than 2,000 feet in a distance of five miles. Above the Yosemite the immense granite knobs or domes of the High Sierra are remark able features in the scenery. Mount Dana, more than 13,000 feet in height, dominates the region above the Yosemite, whilst Mount Whitney, 14,887 feet above the level of the sea, the highest peak in the range, and prob ably the loftiest in the United States \u2014 unless, indeed, Mount St. Elias, in Alaska, is entitled to that distinction \u2014 forms another elevated piece of granitic scenery.* Varieties of granite. \u2014 The appearance of granite is so well known as scarcely to require any description. It seems, when a sharp face is exposed, to be composed of an aggregation of crystals, compacted in varying degrees of den sity from specimens in which they are so loose as to be easily separated, to others in which it is difficult to break the stone which they unite to form. Quartz, felspar, and mica are the names of these minerals. They are always sharply crystallised, never with their angles worn as if they had rolled in water or been subjected to other abrading influences. Sometimes \u2014 most ofteu, indeed \u2014 this rock is found in huge shapeless masses, but not unfrequently it takes the shape of veins, or \" elvans,\" as they are called in Cornwall, which penetrate other rocks, and even different varieties of its own kind. As Ave have already learned, granite is for the most part found bursting through or penetrating with its veins strata as old as the Silurian, the cases in which these ejections are contemporary with the more recently formed beds being entirely exceptional. Hence we are entitled to class granite as the oldest of * Whitney : \"Guide to the Yosemite Valley\" (1875); \" Geological Survey of California,\" Vol. II. ; Cronise : \" The Resources of California\" (18C8)."], [105, "Fig. 46.\u2014 \"EL CAPITAN,\" A GRANITE CLIFF IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY.

For this reason the term plutonic, as distinguished from volcanic, is sometimes specially7 reserved for them, though more frequently it is used as the com mon property of all the igneous rocks. In Scotland the w7hitish-grey granite is specially mined at Rubislaw, the bluish-grey at Cairngall, and the reddish-hued variety at Peterhcad, Aberdeen being the centre of their manufacture into various architectural objects, while from the West of Scotland and Eng land, and Shap Fell in Westmoreland, various porphyritic kinds are introduced. It may be remarked that the Cornish granites are mostly grey, while the others which constitute their chief rivals in commerce, namely, those of Scotland, tend more to red. In London we see the two in conjunction on Waterloo Bridge, where the coping-stone is composed of the latter variety, while the balustrades are constituted of the former. On the Continent we find porphyritic granite in abundance all the way from Elbogen to Carlsbad, in the Carlsbad Mountains, and near Wunsiedel in the Fichtel Mountains, where the large masses of orthoclase crystals which give cha racter to this description of rock are popu larly known as \" Carlsbader Zwillinge,\" or Carlsbad Twins. The Vienna \" plasterstein \" is a grey or yellowish granite with large crystals of orthoclase, and is found exposed in, among other places, the quarries at Mauthhau sen, between Lenz and Krems on the Danube. Another variety, which has been called grouit ite, composed of red orthoclase, with green oligo clase, quartz, magnesia, mica, and sometimes hornblende, is found in the Riesengebirge, at the Brocken in the Harz, and at Baveno on Lago Maggiore ; that at Assouan (Syene), in Upper Egypt \u2014 which was at one time re garded as the typical syenite, and was exten sively employed in the construction of the ancient temples and obelisks of that country \u2014 is a closely-allied variety (p. 91). the igneous rocks, traps \u2014 as we shall learn presently \u2014 intruding into beds of newer age. In appearance the typical granite is greyish. When dusky white, felspar predominates ; when reddish, the materials have been coloured by iron. Syenite is that variety of granite in which the mica is replaced by orthoclase and horn blende, a mineral of a darker hue, while Sye nitic granite is a form in which mica and hornblende are present. Porphyritic syenite is a rock where large crystals of felspar are embedded in a small-grained syenite, this variety being in demand for monuments and other decorative purposes. Again, Zirconian, hypersthenic, and diallagic, are distinguishing terms applied to syenite, in which the mine rals zircon, hypersthene, and diallage replace either wholly or in part the quartz or the hornblende, while pegmatite is a form in which orthoclase, felspar, and quartz, are arranged in lines, which \u2014 as in the \"graphic -granite,\" or \" Lapis Judaicus\" \u2014 give it an appearance, when polished, of being covered with Hebrew charac ters. In Earite, the ingredients are blended into a fine granular mass, and in protogine talc supplants the mica. There are various other varieties characterised by the greater or less amount of particular minerals present, or by the number of simple minerals which make up their substance, the terms binary, ternary7, and quaternary being applied, accord ing as two, three, or four minerals enter into the composition of the rock. Such distinc tions are, however, more for the chemist and the mineralogist than for the geologist proper, since there are many gradations, and several such varieties may be found within a few feet of each other, without the circumstance having any direct bearing on the facts of physical geography which a study of the cliff or hill is calculated to elucidate. All of the forms of granite have certain common characteristics in addition to those already mentioned. For instance, unlike many of the trappean rocks, they are never vesicular, that is, full of cavities ; nor tend to form columns, like basalt ; and being more crystalline and compact, they are regarded as Protogine appears in the Alps at Mont Blanc, in the St. Gothard, and other localities, while pegmatite \u2014 with tourmaline, epidote, garnets, beryls, topazes, and other minerals embedded\u2014"], [107, "VARIETIES OF GRANITE. 91 is seen at Theusing, in the Carlsbad Moun tains, at Wottawa, in the Bohemian Forest, and at Bodenmais,near Zweifel, in the Bavarian Forest.

Though it is quite possible that some of them may be artificial, yet, as they occur in nearly every country and always in the same position, it is all but certain that in the majority of instances they are natural. They may have originated in a tor like mass, or in a series of cuboidal blocks, such as in Fig 47. Then the felspar and other The typical Syenite (that of Syene is, we have seen, more of a granitite than a true syenite) is found at the Plauenscher- Grund, Dresden* in the Erzgebirge, in Moravia, between Briinn and Blansko, in the Alps, in the sy7enite rock of Monzoni in Tyrol, in the Vosges, in Bulgaria (Vitosch, near Sofia), and other places ; the porphyr itic forms have very much the same distribution. Granitite and syenite also form the material of many of the isolated ice- borne blocks scattered over the -~j| country ; and Luxullianite \u2014 a curious Jp variety of granite never yet found in situ \u2014 may be mentioned as the mate rial out of which the Duke of Wei- Fi| lington's sarcophagus in St. Paul's Cathedral is hewn.

The \" loggans,\" or rocking stones, are also specimens of granite weathering in another shape. These rounded boulders, though weighing many tons, are so finely7 Fig. 47. \u2014 THE \"MITTAGSTEIN\" IN THE RIESENGEBIRGE. (Showing granite weathering along the joints in cuboidal blocks.) decomposable ingredients being -washed away by7 the rain, what was formerly a solid pillar becomes, by a gradual process of decay, either a heap of spheroidal masses piled one upon the other, or a single boulder resting on the more massive rock below. In most cases the equi librium of these piled-up boulders is not re tained. The base crumbles and they tumble down. But should a mass so crumble away that in spite of the gradual diminution of its point of support the balance is kept, a rocking stone is the result. A superstitious feeling attaches to many of them, and having been used either as sepulchral monuments (as in Greece) or as means of divination \u2014 the number of vibrations determining the answer to be given by the oracle \u2014 the idea has arisen that all of them were artificial. The great loggan of Land's End, in Cornwall, has been estimated to weigh more than 90 tons. This, like a simi lar one, the \" Buckstone \" in Monmouthshire, was overturned by some mischievous idlers, but * Syenite, formerly applied to a rock in which mica is replaced by hornblende, is now by most lithologists re stricted to one in which orthoclase and hornblende unite (sometimes with augite, plagioclase, biotite, or augite), to make a granular rock such as that at the Plauenscher- Grund, to which Werner first applied the name, though at a later date he made it out to be a greenstone. This rock is, according to Sir A. Geikie, found in Raasay, Skye, and Antrim, where it has penetrated Jurassic rocks, and is itself probably of older Tertiary age. The rock of Syene, which we have indicated as more like granitite, is by this geologist looked on as syenite-granite. It is also found in many parts of Scotland, Skye, for example, where it has invaded and altered the Lias beds."], [108, "92 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. the stratified rocksin the shape of veins, which often harden into wall -like upright seams (\"dykes\"), or overspread them in the form of sheets, or pour out on the surface into rounded knolls. Indeed, these trappean rocks have been one of the powerful agents in disrupting and altering the stratified rocks through which they have been erupted in a molten condition. The scenery of a trappean country is, as a rule, more picturesque than that of a granite one. The step-like terraces, so characteristic of Trap, and the tendency to crumble in more or less cuboidal fragments, give variety to the cliffs of this rock, even when it does not rise in the form of conical hills ; while the rich soil usually produced from the wearing-down of all volcanic rocks, combined with the easy drain age afforded by their many joints, renders the regions where they rise to the surface unusu ally fertile, and, therefore, more thickly peopled than one more barren. The trappean rocks also assume more varied forms than the gra nitic, and though the hills which they enter into the composition of \u2014 the Welsh, Derbyshire, Cheviot, Lammermoor, Ochil, Pentland, and most of the Irish ones, for example \u2014 are rarely so lofty as those of granitic origin, they gain in capability for human occupation what they lose in Alpine grandeur. Add to this that when the traps tend to take a columnar form they give a remarkable feature to many of the show places of the world, Fingal's Cave (Fig. 48), Samson's Ribs, on Arthur's Seat, near Edinburgh, and the Giant's Cause way, in Ireland, being among the most familiar types of this form of \" basalt.\" was eventually replaced at an immense cost of time, money, and labour. One situated at Islandmagee. on Brown's Bay, in Ireland, is by the superstitious people in the neighbourhood believed to acquire a rocking, tremulous mo tion at the approach of malefactors and other heinous sinners. Finally, it may be added that when granite weathers in such a manner as to leave boulder-shaped masses on the summit of a hill, these collections of rocks are known in Germany as a \" Felsenmeer,\" or Sea of Rocks. Such a one occurs at Felsberg, in the Odenwald. Trappean Rocks. \" Trap \" was at one time a term applied to any igneous rock, tolerably compact, and of a newish date, which was not granitic. It was, as Professor Bonney very aptly remarks, a \" traveller's term \" \u2014 one used legitimately when a more precise one was impossible. In roughly grouping the unstratified rocks, there fore, it may be usefully retained to describe the entire group of which the \" whinstone \" of the North Country people is the type, though the specialised labours of petromicro scopists have succeeded in dividing them into a number of classes, one of which slides almost insensibly into the granitic. Indeed, the rock near Dresden, which Werner at one time classed as syenite, was afterwards assigned by him to the dolerites (p. 91). This transi tion is clearly shown in the bust of Rameses in the British Museum. Though composed of one continuous mass of rock, the head, as Richardson pointed out many years ago, is of syenite, or granitite, while the body is of un doubted greenstone. Yet, though the litho logists may cavil at any such broad distinc tion between this order of rocks and the one which preceded it, the physico-geographer can rarely have any difficulty in the matter. The Trap series are, in general language, lavas which have been vomited out of ancient vol canoes, for the most part under water, and are in the majority of instances associated with strata of a newer age than those through which granite bursts. Otherwise their mode of occur rence is not widely different. They intersect As nearly every secondary district is dis turbed by trappean rocks, there is no difficulty in finding examples of the different varieties. The \" road-metal,\" with which the highways are macadamised, is most probably, if not granite or flint, some form of trap. The \" cobble pavements\" of some old-fashioned towns are almost invariably of this rock, and in districts like that in the vicinity of Innerleithen, in the south of Scotland, the houses are com monly built of these unattractive-looking rocks. They have been employed for sculpture, some of the Hindoo, Persian, and Egyptian works of"], [109, "TRAPPEAN ROCKS. 93 art being hewn out of the close-grained green stones and basalts, while from the cavities in the \" amygdaloids \" of the north of Scotland and the Rhine are obtained those \"Scotch pebbles\" now so extensively used in jewellery. Mineral veins are not common in the trappean series ; but there is one notable exception in the plates, strings, and blocks of native copper which per meate so many of the traps in the vicinity of which the prehistoric miners had left be hind them when they abandoned the work ing of these rich deposits fully four centuries ago. * '8 Generally speaking, the traps are widely dif ferent from the typical granites, though the more divergent forms of the two series might easily be mistaken, even when they do not run into each other.

Lake Superior, and have been found in Alaska and on the shores of British Columbia, though there, as in the traps of Dumbartonshire, the metal is distributed too sparingly to render what has as yet been unearthed of any com mercial importance. On the shores of Lake Superior, however, vast fortunes have been accumulated by the fortunate rediscoverers of these virgin veins. Yet, before they lit upon the mines, the ancient workings show that some aboriginal race, who have left behind them no other records than their rude stone tools, had ages ago been busy7 raising the lumps of precious metal. At the Cliff Mine, on the Keweenaw Peninsula, there are tun nels hewn in the solid copper, some of the masses which have been hacked out by manual labour weighing as much as eighty7 tons. In the old workings were found nu merous stone mauls and hammers, gads, gouges, and chisels made of stone and copper, their numerous and puzzling varieties, it be comes impossible to assign any brief character by which they may be distinguished. Some, like basalt and greenstone, are close-grained and crystalline, while the trap-tuff's and so-called claystone - porphyries are soft and earthy7. Nor does the guide which their mineralogical structure supplies afford any surer ground for their classification. Augite, felspar, and hornblende are the principal minerals which enter into their composition ; though hyrjersthene, olivine, quartz, clay, iron, and green-earth, are also found in varying quantities. Their physical structure is almost equally7 varied. Some, for example, are vesicu lar, full of air-bubble cavities, like the lavas ; loose and cindery7, or scoriaceous. like vol canic ashes ; brecciated (p. 52), like the ac cumulations around volcanoes ; columnar, like * Wilson : \"Prehistoric Man\" (18710.

Again, the terms applied to these rocks have been rather loosely employed. For in stance, the word \"porphyry\" was originally7 used to describe the dark red or purple rock of Djebel ed-Dokhan, in Egypt, so largely used by the Romans for decorative purposes. In time the word became to be employed to desig nate almost any rock in which one prominent mineral was embedded in a more compact The Melaphyre group is another rather vague term, though it is generally understood to apply to dark, compact rocks of \" considerable geological age,\" and defined as normally con sisting of \"felspar, augite, and iron-peroxide,\" though in reality some of these rocks are por phyrites and others only very ancient basalts. The Trachyte group is more natural and Fig. 49.\u2014 \"DER BORZEN,\" NEAR BILIN, IN BOHEMIA\u2014 A PHONOLITE HILL. matrix ; so that we had porphyritic granites and porphyritic traps. This vague nomencla ture ought to be abandoned, for, as Professor Bonney very properly remarks, the word por phyry does not sufficiently describe any par ticular rock, though the adjective porphyritic may be usefully applied to designate a struc ture in which isolated crystals appear pro minently, and are probably the remains of a former state of solidification which have sur vived the last melting down of the rock. better defined, consisting of rocks which show a coarse cellular paste, rough and gritty to the touch, comprising quartz-trachyte, rhyo lite, phonolite or clinkstone \u2014 such as we see in the \"Borzen,\" a hill near Bilin, in Bohemia (Fig. 49), which is so called from the clinking or metallic sound which it emits when struck with a hammer, \u2014 obsidian, and perlite\u2014 those glassy lavas hardly distinguishable from arti ficial glass-slag, of which the ancients made looking-glass, and which many savage races use to this day for the fabrication of arrow heads, knives, axes, and other cutting-tools.

Like felstone, Hence, we have porphyritic granite in the shape of the mass which presents the great orthoclase crystals called \" Carlsbad Twins \" (p. 90), and the entire porphyry granite which comprises, among other rocks, quartz-porphyry"], [111, "THE TRACHYTE AND BASALT GROUPS. 95 it used to be included among the basalts ; but, it is now taken to indicate the more compact diorites, diabases, and slightly de composed basalts ; while felstone, according to Dr. Bonney, includes the felsites, porphyrites, and perhaps, accidentally, some phonolites. another group. In ordinary language they may be described as varieties of greenstone, and owe their dark colour to the disseminated plates of hornblende, of which they are com posed, in addition to felspar. Different varieties of it are found in Moravia, in the Sudeten, in the Erzgebirge, in the Island of Corsica (where a variety called napoleonite exists), in the Bohemian forest, in the Carlsbad mountains, in the Fichtel mountains (near Wolsau), as well as in Egypt, between the Island of Phil\u00e6 and Assouan (black porphyrite), where it sup plied much of the material out of which the ancient statues were hewn. Then there is the Basalt group proper, which comprises dolerite, a form of greenstone composed of felspar and augite, usually with some intervening trace of other minerals such as olivine and iron-peroxide. The term basalt, at one time applied very vaguely, is now retained for a rock in which the constituents mentioned are so minute that the mass is black. There are various varieties of it into which we need not enter, though the columnar form which gives so marked a feature to the scenery of the world is, perhaps, the best-known form. Diabase, another gradation from dolerites and basalts, in which a chloritic mineral and generally a little calcite are present, is in Germany found in the Harz, in Nassau* Saxony, in the Fichtel mountains, in Bohemia, near Kuchelbad, as well as at Prague and other localities. Its extreme beauty has caused it to be employed in the arts, its green colour, due to the chlorite, contrasted with the crystals of felspar, having given it the name of green porphyry or \" porfido-verde,\" by which it is known to artists. Dolerite, in the shape of nephehne-dolerite, is seen in the Katzenbuckel of the Oden- wald ; leucitophyre is exhibited near the sum- mit of Mount Vesuvius, &c. ; while a small horny-looking variety, called anamesite, is seen in numerous other localities, such as the old volcanoes of Bohemia, the extinct group of volcanoes in Auvergne, and in Scotland, Ireland, &c. Basalt \u2014 which in this case, as we have seen (p. 85), contains metallic iron discernible by the microscope, besides nickel, as in the blocks found on the Greenland shore \u2014 is seen in the nepheline form at Nieder- mendig on the Rhine, in the leucite variety in the Albanian mountains near Rome, in the Eifel, and at Schackau on the Rhone. Many mountain chains are composed of basalt, as the Auvergne in France, the Eifel in Central Germany, the Westerwald, the Vogelsgebirge, and, not to enumerate localities the very names ot which would fill many pages, the Giant's Causeway at Antrim, the Island of Staff'a with Fingal's Cave (Fig. 48, p. 93), the scarcely less remarkable columnar structures of Skye, Ailsa, and Morven ; the Kasegrotte (Cheese Grotto) at Bertrich-Baden, half-way between Treves and Coblenz (Fig. 50) ; or the columnar pillars on the hill-sides of Vicenza in Italy. The Porphyrite group may be reckoned another sub-section of the dolerites, though with the limitations already mentioned (p. 94). In all of them we see the structure alluded to. Quartz-porphyrite, or felsite - porphyrite, is a light, rather reddish mass, where quartz and orthoclase crystals make up the mass. It is found in large quantities near Botzen in South Tyrol, in Saxony near Leipsic, and Halle, where it forms basins, as in the Thur ingian Forest. The amorphous, glossy form of felsite is known as pitchstone, such as we see in the Island of Arran, at Meissen, and in the Triebisch Valley7 in Saxony. Porphyrite proper is usually of a dark colour with brownish-red or brown solid masses, which contain crystals of oligoclase mixed with horn blende and mica. It is found in Saxony7 in the Thuringian Forest, in Scandinavia, and in Egypt at Djebel ed-Dokhan (p. 94), which -was the locality whence was derived the ancient red porphyry, or \" porfido rosso antico,\" so valued by the Romans. The Diorites are, by some geologists, made"], [112, "OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. 96 amount of industry, and no slight degree of ingenuity, in attempting to classify them by their chemical composition, and by the ar rangement of the minerals entering into them, as revealed by the microscope.

Even the simpler attempts to roughly group them according to their age into the granites, which are, as a rule, the oldest of all ; into the trappean, which are of later appearance ; and into the. volcanic series, which are at present in course of for mation, or have been vomited out of the \" bowels of the earth \" in comparatively recent periods of the world's history, even these at tempts fail to stand the test of criticism. For, apart from a doubt as to the granites deserv ing the place of honour as regards antiquity, it is not difficult to find the match of every trap pean rock in the vast masses of lavas and other debris shot out of the crater of any of the active volcanoes of our times. Indeed, to use the words of Sir James Hall, \" the analogy between the two classes \" \u2014 the ancient and the modern igneous rocks \u2014 \" seems to hold through all their varieties ; and I am confident there is not a lava of Mount Etna to which a counterpart may not be produced from the whinstones of Scotland.\" This brings us to inquire what has been the origin of these igneous rocks. they not only tilt, fissure, and generahy dis locate the beds in the manner already de scribed, but indurate and otherwise alter the parts they come into immediate contact with for a considerable distance on either side. Thus, the limestones and chalk become crystalline marl des ; sandstones are changed into white cherty rocks, called quartzites, and some shales into porcelain-jaspers, and even hornstone ; while in the vicinity of granitic veins new minerals are frequently developed. Granite. \u2014 The igneous origin of the granites is not at first sight quite so evident, though from the typical grey granite there are all Fig. 51. \u2014 DIAGRAM SHOWING GRANITE INTRUDING AMONG STRATIFIED ROCKS. or, Granite ; k, Crystalline schists. gradations until the tyqfical trappean rock is reached, so that it is difficult to separate the causes to which the one is clue from those to which the others are attributed. It is true that we do not find those columnar and Origin of the Igneous Rocks. That the igneous rocks owe their origin to fire is clear from various considerations. In the first place, the perfect resemblance which so many of them bear to the melted matter poured out by volcanoes goes far to suggest that they must have hiftl a similar origin. But when we examine the way in which they occur, this suspicion becomes an absolute certainty. They do not, as is already known, lie in regular beds, but are either heaped up in shapeless accumulations on the surface, or poured in among the stratified beds, either by these beds having been formed after the eruption of lava took place, or by the erupted matter bursting through the strata in the line of least resistance. In the latter case we see the offshoots of the igneous rocks taking the form of wall-like partitions, or \" dy7kes,\" as they are called, penetrating long distances through the beds, or branching in tree-like masses of less regular form. But wherever the igneous mcks burst through the strata above them, Fig. 52. \u2014 SECTION SHOWING FRAGMENTS OF HORNBLENDE IN GRANITE WHICH HAS ENVELOPED THEM DURING AN ERUPTION OF THE MOLTEN ROCK. a, Granite ; b. Hornblende. spheroidal structures which, in the case of the trappean rocks, point so distinctly to their having been cooled from a state of fiery fusion. But the granites, like the other igneous rocks, exhibit the eruptive features on which we have already commented. Like them they burst through and branch out into tree-like masses among the stratified ones (Figs. 51, 52, 53, 57). And not only do they intrude in 7"], [114, "98 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. their present crystalline structure. In brief, the Huttonian doctrines, modified and ex tended by the researches of the present cen tury, are essentially those held by the modern geologist.* this way, but granite veins are not unfre quently intersected by veins of granite newer than themselves, and wherever they come in contact with softer beds the dykes and veins of granite alter, generally by hardening, the rocks on either side. Still, the varied features But though the Vulcanists have long ago supplanted the Neptunists in the hierarchy of science, they made a stout fight for their ancient supremacy. In Edinburgh especially, where Dr. Hutton lived, aud Professor Jameson, the principal exponent of the opposite doctrines, taught, the controversy waxed so hot that it took an almost personal turn. Paris during the closing years of the ancien regime was not more stoutly divided by7 the rivalries of the Gluckists and Piccinists ; or the Holy Roman Empire, four hundred years ago, by the conflicts of the Guelphs and Ghibellines, than was the Scottish capital when the nineteenth century was young by the bitter controversies of the Neptunists and Vulcanists. They did not go to war, cer tainly, though there are traditions of hot words and threatened conflicts in a day when even philosophers wore swords ; and when a play from which greater things were expected failed to receive the approbation of a critical audience, its friends declared that because it had been written by a Wernerian, \"it was damned by a packed house of Huttonians.\" Still, though this is now rather ancient history, the ideas which formed the central point round which the discussion was warmest have left their mark on geological thought, even up to our own times. Lithologists of a certain type of mind \u2014 the mind which can only see one set of phenomena at a time may even yet be found dwelling with longing love on the \" aqueous condition of formation \" which granite has undergone. The principal arguments in favour of the non-igneous origin of granite are that it contains certain minerals that could not have existed in a state of fusion in the presence of free silica without combining with it, and that some of the ac cessory minerals in granite would suffer change by an elevation of temperature ; while, if the Fig. 53. \u2014 GRANITIC VXEINS OF APOPHYSES AT SANGER- BERG, IN THE CARLSBAD MOUNTAINS. a, Granite veins ; b, Hornblenriic schists. which the granites possess, and especially their very sharply crystalline particles, have led to hot discussions regarding their origin. At one time the entire geological world was divided into Wernerians and Huttonians, or, as they were sometimes called, Neptunists and Vulcanists. The one set of theorists were the disciples of Werner, for long the head of the great mining school of Freiberg, in Saxony, who taught that all the phenomena exhibited in the earth's crust were to be attributed to the operation of water, to the utter exclusion of an agent so clearly manifest as* fire. The Huttonians, on the other hand, placing their faith on the sounder reasoning of Dr. Hutton, a Scottish physician, enun ciated a theory of the world the reverse in all essential points of that advocated by the German mineralogist and his school, for though they did not exclude the action of water and atmospheric agents in forming the sedimentary rocks, they pointed out that these had been consolidated by heat, and that many of them had been altered by the long-con tinued action of the same agency. But, above all, the Huttonians not only declared that the igneous origin of the trappean rocks was obvious, but that the granites were crystal lised from a state of fiery fusion at great depths in the earth, under pressure so vast as to prevent the gases generated from es caping, and thus to enable them to assume * Play f air's \" Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory\" (1802)."], [115, "GRANITES AND TRAPS. 99 crystals had been fused, it would scarcely have been possible for them to contain water, as they occasionally do. However, as Mr. Rudler suggests, it is possible that, in most instances, these minerals are of secondary origin, and have been produced by the alterations of the granite after it has cooled from the primitive condition of fusion. Moreover, the mere pre sence of water is not incompatible with the received origin of granite, for David Forbes declares that specimens of lava taken from a current in Etna while the lava was still flow ing contained crystals of stilbite, a mineral holding 16 per cent, of water in its composi tion. Even in the quartz of volcanic rocks there are httle cavities containing water. But unless we adopt Dr. Haughton's hypothesis that the rock, after having been poured into dykes and veins when in a state of fusion, has been altered by the action of water of a high temperature, the position in which granite is found debars us from accepting any explanation of its origin except an igneous one. Indeed, the narrowness of the fissures into which it obtrudes itself points conclu sively to the mass having been completely molten when it forced its way through the rock in which it forms veins, and not simply a viscous paste, as has been suggested. Of late years there has been a tendency to regard granite not only as in no degree older than the trappean rocks \u2014 since the rule that it is found for the most part penetrating the more ancient stratified deposits has so many exceptions \u2014 but even as an altered stratified rock. That is, it is sometimes a very much transformed or \" metamorphosed \" description oi gneiss, which gneiss is again considered an altered sedimentary formation \u2014 the gradation being so gradual. Such speculations may7, how ever, be regarded as more ingenious than sound, and, in any case, scarcely admit of being re ceived in the present state of knowledge.* It is, however, certain, from Mr. Sorby's ob servations, j- that granite has solidified under vast pressure, the microscopical structure of its constituent minerals being in every respect analogous to that of those found at great depths and ejected from modern volcanoes. Traps. \u2014 There is thus no reasonable doubt that both the granitic and the trappean rocks are of igneous origin, and that theh varied and often perplexing texture is to a large ex tent due to the varying rapidity7 with which they have cooled \u2014 the same mass becoming an obsidian-like block when suddenly cooled, a basalt when heat is withdrawn more slowly, and an earthy or imperfect crystalline one when the cooling goes on still less rapidly; while the columnar structure of basalt was proved by the experiments of Gregory Watt to be due to the pressure of numerous spher oids on each other in the act of cooling. It was as if a number of cannon-balls were piled on each other and then melted : the pressure of these spherical bodies on one another producing a columnar shape very similar to what we so frequently see in the rock in question. The extinct volcanoes found in all parts of the world afford ample evidence of the identity of the causes which have been at work in producing the modern and the an cient igneous rocks, while the outbursts of the modern ones are almost equally7 to the point. Many of the ancient basalts, we have seen, are barely to be distinguished from the modern lavas, either in structure or in the minerals which are embedded in their interstices and substance, and when opportunity occurs the modern igneous rocks, equally with the ancient ones, intrude into the neighbouring strata and alter their texture at the points wdiere they come in contact with such beds. Nor are data of a similar character lacking for an identification of the origin of granite. For though no volcanoes of modern times \u2014 or even of a period which geologically there is any reason to pronounce comparatively7 recent \u2014 vomit forth granite, this rock so insensibly graduates through granitite and syenite into greenstone and basalt, that it is not stretching a point to pronounce all the igneous rocks of a similar origin \u2014 that is, they7 have been derived * Ramsay : \" Physical Geology and Geography of Great Britain \" (1878), p. 42.

While studying the subject of dislocations in strata we saw that frequently fissures of vary ing breadth were produced. Sometimes these fissures were filled up by debris derived from the broken beds. But it is also evident that they may be occupied by materials which have infiltrated into them from other sources, and it is equally clear that in the eruption of molten material from below, the granitic and trappean rocks must not only disrupt the beds through which they burst, but form \u2014 in the shape of these tree-like masses which they assume \u2014 not only veins, or \" apophyses,\" but actually walls or dykes of solid material. These dykes form, therefore, the theme of a short explanation. earth's crust are \u00c6omposed are examined. The igneous character of such dykes is shown by the rocks through which they burst being baked and altered on each side. The coal is converted into cinder, the slate into jasper or Lydian stone, or into a rock very like porcelain ; the soft sandstone into hard rock, or even half- fused into a crystalline mass known as quartzite ; while, as in the Giant's Causeway, the chalk in immediate contiguity to the trap dykes is altered into marble, a change which will occur, not if chalk is burnt, but if heat is applied under such an amount of pressure as to prevent the escape of the carbon dioxide \u2014 or, in more familiar language, carbonic acid \u2014 which, in union with lime, makes up the rock men tioned. Sometimes these dykes form per fectly straight walls, so that when the softer rocks on each side wear away under the action of the elements, the dyke will often traverse the country for miles as a more or less unbroken wall, which by the uninitiated might -easily enough be, as indeed they have been, mistaken for an artificial fence.

Sometimes they are not more than a few inches wide, while, as in one intersecting the Dudley coal field, they may be 420 feet broad ; or 134 feet broad, as in the remarkable one near Plas- Newydd in Anglesea ; or fifty or. sixty feet broad, as in the Cleveland dyke, which runs from near Whitby in Yorkshire to Cockfield Fell, a dis tance of nearly sixty miles. As likely as not, they proceed far down into the interior of the earth to some central mass of the same rock as that of which they are composed, though (Showing a Dyke-like \"Neck,\" ending in a Boss (or Crater), and sending a Shoot over the Sedimentary Strata through which it has burst.) b, Dyke; c, Boss; rf, Overspreading Sheet ; a, Sedimentary beds. time have influenced or controlled it, the tendency of the molten lava being to find a path to the surface along the line of least resistance. Dykes very frequently take the line of faults, the molten matter having occupied the fissure thus produced, and as often as not greatly enlarged it. When the rocks on either side of the dyke are soft, they7 wear away and leave the harder wall of trap standing isolated. However, this is not invariably the case. For, as in Arran, where there are dykes penetrat ing hard sandstones, the intrusive trap has crumbled away, while the rock through which it has burst remains proof against the weather, and the place formerly occupied by the dyke is open for a considerable distance. Or, if the dyke is on either side in contiguity with a rock which it has indurated for a consider able distance outward, this rock will resist the weathering influences better than the dyke itself, and last, long after the trap which has hardened it has disappeared, in the shape of two walls following the line of the fissure between them. This also is seen in the Island of Arran, and other parts of Scotland. 1771 Fig. 51. \u2014 SECTION OF THE 1SERTHAL NEAR OBER- SITOWA, BOHEMIA.

In many7 instances the dyke branches, or sends intrusive sheets hori zontally among the stratified beds (Figs. 54, 5G), or expands itself on the surface in the form of a boss-like hill (Fig. 55). Indeed, the modes Granite dykes though perhaps not quite so familiar as trappean ones, are still sufficiently common. This rock not only bursts through other rocks, but, we have seen, branches out in numerous twig-like veins, which sometimes cross one another, and, like trap, appear on the surface in the form of bosses or domes, * Brown ; \" Geology of Disco Island and the Noursoak Peninsula\" {Transactions of the Geological Society of Glasgoic, Vol. V., pp. 55 \u2014 115.)"], [118, "102 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. actual lava stream to its source within the bowels of the earth, we should in all proba bility be able to mark in its course every gradation, from pumice or obsidian to actual granite.\" * Elvans. \u2014 In Cornwall, the local term of \" elvans \" is applied to quartz-felsite in veins, this rock differing from granite mainly in the absence of mica,. But in reality the word is loosely used to express very fine-grained \u25a0 granite, or, as Mr. Rudler most properly re marks, is applied to almost any rock which occurs in a dyke running through \"killas\" or clay-slate. In the accompanying diagram (Fig. 57), some of the main facts discussed in the preceding pages are portrayed. as in the Islands of Skye, Mull, and Arran, which Professor Judd has shown were the cones of old volcanoes. From these central masses there can be traced in various directions Fig. 56. \u2014 DTKE OF MELAPHTRE AT ZDERETZ, ON THE PARDUBITZ-TURNAUER RAILWAY IN BOHEMIA.' (Showing the Dyke Overflowing on the Surface in the shape of a Sheet.) spurs and dykes which \" exhibit every variety of structure from coarsely crystalline granite to the vitreous substance of lava.\" Moreover, these dykes, we learn from Mr. Jukes- Browne, are connected with lava-like sheets of rhyolite and trachyte, which occur round the flanks of the mountains, thus confirming the belief that, though the granite was consolidated under a great thickness of overlying rock and Mineral Veins. The word vein, as contradistinguished from dyke, is usually understood to express a wavy rather than a straight course of the fissure with its contained matter. But in reality the distinction is not strictly adhered to, many mineral veins or lodes being rectilineal. It is, Fig. 57. \u2014 IDEAL SECTION THROUGH THE EARTH'S CRUST.

The first class are often exceedingly fine, and form a perfect net-work. They are pro bably cracks into which the matter which now fills them \u2014 be it quartz or carbonate of lime * \u2014 has infiltrated by \" segregation \" from the surrounding rocks. We have already seen something of the other class when speak ing of the igneous rocks, though those with which we are immediately concerned are the fissures of this type containing mineral matter, in various chemical combinations, mingled with or embedded in a matrix of material different from the rock through which the vein runs. This material may be derived from some central mass, though recent investiga tions have gone far to show that these veins might not have been veins of intrusion, but, as Mr. Tate puts it, the metalliferous deposit may have arisen without any original fissure by a slow metamorphic action gradually replacing the original rock-constituent. However, in most cases where metallic veins pass through various rocks, they were originally fissures made by faults, or shrinkage of the rock, and kept open \u2014 as they often are in hard rocks \u2014 or widened by the entrance of water. In other Relation of Direction and Contents, etc. \u2014 Many attempts have been made to eliminate the various exceptional circumstances which are found in certain veins in order, if possible, to formulate a law connected with their origin and distribution. Hitherto these efforts have not resulted in any very marked success. Still, we are able to say that some relation exists between the contents of the metalli ferous veins and the course in which they run. For example, the lead lodes of Cornwall and Devonshire take a north and south direction, while those which run east and west contain tin and copper ores, and, in British Columbia, gold-bearing quartz veins take a similar course. It may also be said, in general terms, that most of the lodes from which the chief supplies of ores are obtained permeate the oldest set of beds in the earth's crust ; for, though the gold quartz of California, Central America, and Peru is found in \" secondary \" beds, this metal, in Australia and most other countries \u2014 the Oural Mountains, for example \u2014 is confined to reefs traversing \" pal\u00e6ozoic \" strata, chiefly of Lower Silurian age. As the auriferous quartz is richest in the vicinity7 of eruptive rocks, it may not unreasonably be assumed that when the reefs are found in the younger beds \u2014 as in California \u2014 their pre sence may be connected with the intrusion of diorite or other igneous rock. But whatever the thickness of the mineral vein \u2014 whether a mere thread, or, as in the great ironstone lode of the Red Mountain, near Schwarzenbergf in the Erztrebirofe, 40 to 50 feet thick, for a distance of fully four miles \u2014 the minerals it contains are usually in a crystalline form \u2014 quartz, carbonate of lime, fluor-spar, or barytes, this being termed by the miner \" gangue \" or vein-stuff', his object of search being of course the ore embedded in it. Sometimes the vein stuff occupies the greater part of the space, the ore occurring either in \" nests \" or \" string's,\" or as scattered crystals, though frequently the walls of the vein are coated with a crys talline layer of some substance ; on this Fig. 58. \u2014 VEINS.

The most frequent materials of this vein-stuff are com mon quartz and carbonate of lime, in the veins But the more common kind of mineral veins are those worked by vertical shafts, and may be regarded as the results of mechanical violence. They may be of all widths and depths, and extend through every kind of rock, stratified and unstratified, holding, however, a determinate course for many miles, and passing through rocks of very varied mineral Fig. 59. \u2014 THE '-' DREI-PRINZEN \" VEIN AT FREIBERG. (Showing the Vein Matter in Symmetrical Layers or Bands.) penetrating igneous rocks. The vein-space may be formed in any of the ways mentioned, though not unfrequently it is due to shrinking of the hard rock during drying, or, in the case of an igneous ore, in cooling from a high to a low temperature. After this, the silicious, cal careous, and metallic substances found their way into these empty spaces by infiltration from the surrounding rocks. Mixed with hot water and steam, metallic ores may have per meated the mass until they reached these receptacles, formed by shrinkage or by other causes ; or getting into cavities in the rock formed in much the same way, they may have given rise to that irregular assemblage of metal- composition. The Great Quartz vein of Cali fornia can be traced for a distance of eighty miles, though, like all veins, it varies much in productiveness in different parts of its course. Occasionally we find a vein, say, of tin, broken by a fault, the space formed by which is filled, say, by copper, and even a secondary, tertiary, or quaternary dislocation of the same kind by which the different lodes * These seem much the same as what are known in the North of England as '-pipe veins\" or \"flat veins.\" t Lyell's \"Elements of Geology,\" pp. 589 \u2014 602, from which many of the facts mentioned in this section are condensed, contains, so far as a text book can, an admir able summary of the state of knowledge on this subject, which more recent researches have done little to modify."], [121, "MINERAL VEINS. 105 have been repeatedly dislocated, until mining in a locality such as Huel Peever, at Redruth, requires an intimate acquaintance with the geological structure of the district. contrary, according to the chance results of the terrestrial disturbance exemplified by this movement of the contiguous edges represent ing the walls of the veins. That veins have been disturbed after beino- filled is seen by some of them having a fissure down through the middle of their contents, the sides of which, where in contact, are polished, or scored with parallel furrows, in the way we have lately learned to know as \" slicken-sides \" (p. 81); and that many of them at one time opened on the surface is proved by7 the not unfrequent occurrence of rolled pebbles in the veins, these pebbles corre- sponding to those on the neighbouring super- ficial alluvium. Marine shells have also been disinterred at great depth in metallic veins, and a madrepore has been found in the heart of a compact vein of cinnabar (the ore of quicksilver) in Hungary7. These facts point to the vein having been opened by an earthquake or other terrestrial disturbance while the rock which it traverses was under the sea. There is also evidence which renders it more than probable that the veins, after having been grad- ually filled, have not only been opened, but on successive occasions enlarged. What is more, we find many veins alternately contracting and swelling, though, as a rule, the two sides of a metalliferous vein are nearly parallel over a wide extent of country. The contrary is, however, the case in others, the variations in breadth running in a few feet all the way from one or two inches to eight or ten feet. The explanation of this peculiarity is to be found, as Sir Henry de la Beche put it, in the fact that the sides of a vein are sometimes more or less wavy7. In such a case, if the opposite sides of an irregular fissure of this character slid upon each other in the way the facts mentioned prove must often have happened, then all manner of spaces, narrow and broad, will be the result. This can be readily demon- strated by dividing a sheet of paper vertically by means of a wavy line ; then slide the cut edges up and down : the result will show that the space between the edges will be of very varying breadth as the concavities and con vexities come opposite to each other, or the Most veins are tolerably perpendicular to the surface, just as most faults are. But they may slope at different angles ; in such a case the upper side of the vein is known to miners as the \"hanging \"wall, the lower as the \"lying\" or \" foot \" wall. When the lode is tortuous, it generally happens that at the place where it departs from the vertical it is choked with stones, or, as miners put it, is \" nipped,\" the ore being at such a point small in quantity, on account of the space being preoccupied by the debris in question. On the other hand, when the lodes are wide they are usually filled with earth and fragments of rock, throuarh which the ores are disseminated; these detached pieces of rock are frequently coated or en circled by metallic substances, and are known as \"horses\" or \"riders.\" Finally, that we should find some veins which split into branches is only natural; for the same fact holds true regarding the non-metallic fissures, which are considered of identical origin. No very constant law has as yet been de duced regarding the occurrence of veins, or as to the conditions under which they are to \" twitch \" or close their walls, or \" belly out \" into wider expansions. However, when the vein traverses a succession of strata \u2014 and it is perhaps unnecessary7 to say that they always cut across the beds, and are in no case con nected with the lines of deposition \u2014 it has been noticed that in the shales and sandstones they are narrowest, and, perhaps, owing to the infiltrating water acting more easily on lime than on the materials of which the other rocks are composed, they are widest in lime stone of any \"country rock\" \u2014 the country rock being that through which the veins run. The contents of mineral veins, according to the manner in which the vein-stuff' is disposed, are spoken of as \" massive,\" such as barytes, when no definite arrangement of the contents can be traced ; as \" drusy,\" when the vein is made up of cavities filled with crystalline mine rals ; as \"banded and comby \" (Fig. 59), when"], [122, "106 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. since they7 were formed, have served as the channel through which water has infiltrated, is proved by the rock through which they pass being considerably decomposed, and the vein-matter being recrystallised into various minerals. the opposite wall -faces are covered with comb-like lay7ers, sometimes exactly dupli cated ; as \" brecciated \" when fragments of the neighbouring rock are mixed among the ores (p. 105); or as \"filamentous,\" where the mine rals are dispersed, as often happens in thread like veins. The ore may7, however, occur in various forms. Gold is, for example, dis seminated through quartz, often in grains so fine that they cannot be detected with the naked eye, but after the rock is crushed have to be caught up by coming in contact with quicksilver, the quicksilver of this amalgam being then driven off by heat, when the more valuable metal remains. Again, these patches may be in the form of considerable masses, or \"nuggets,\" the gold found in the beds of streams being simply7 the metal which has got freed by the crumbling down of the original quartz rock, and washed into the places where it is the \" digger's \" business to separate it from the sand and gravel by water or other means. Sometimes, indeed, the gold is . found in \"pockets\" in the rock in the shape of beautifully crystallised moss-like masses, and in various other forms. Copper is also occasionally lit upon in this form, though it is usually in strings, bunches, or branches, when in the native state (p. 93). But, like most other metallic ores, it is more generally mined as a chemical compound \u2014 a sulphate, a car bonate, or some such compound. All of these facts \u2014 and we have not men tioned more than the leading ones \u2014 invite a discussion of the causes which have been at work in filling these fissures in the earth's crust with the deposits described. How mineral veins have been filled. \u2014 The theories at present held fall broadly into two divisions. The first of these affirms that mineral matter in the veins has been derived by7 a process called \" leaching,\" that is to say, it has been dissolved out of the ad jacent rocks and then re-deposited in the vein fissure. The second of these theories contends that the ores have been brought up from great depths by mineral springs, in which they have been dissolved ; or in steam ; or by sublimation, just as the vapour of sul phurous acid \" sublimates \" into brimstone round the mouths of volcanoes ; or after they have been melted by fire, and then ejected into the vein-cavity just as if they had been lava. In reality, there is a good deal to be said for both theories, and most probably veins haA'e been formed in both ways, though the source whence the mineral matter itself has been derived is by no means so patent. That in the great majority of cases \u2014 indeed, in all but exceptional instances \u2014 it has been in solution, and subsequently deposited from this watery solution, is clear. But it is evi dent that the rock through which the vein runs has had so marked an influence on this process of precipitation that it is not always possible to say whether the mineral matter has not been \"leached\" out of \"the country,\" though in a few cases we are able to say that the materials have been ejected into the fissures in which they lie through the agency of hot water. This has some times been the case in California, albeit the vast amount of the gold and other mineral deposits of that State cannot with any These ores are usually arranged in parallel layers (Fig. 59) alternating with the vein stuff', or occupying, as is the case with pyrites and sometimes with galena (the ore of lead), the entire space of the vein, though the instances in which more than one ore is pre sent are more frequent. It is also a subject of common observation that when a vein runs through several different kinds of rocks, it is richer in particular ores. Galena, for example \u2014 in the North of England, at least \u2014 is most abundant in the limestones, and scant in the shales ; and in Cornwall and Devon, where the \"country rock \" happens to be granite and slate, it has been observed that when crossing the one the veins yield iron, and copper when they traverse the other. That the veins,"], [123, "ORE IN MASSES CONCRETIONS. 107 certainty be referred to this mode of origin.* The discovery by Professor Sandberger ot small quantities of silver, lead, copper, nickel, cobalt, bismuth, arsenic, antimony7, and tin, in minerals such as olivine, augite, hornblende, and mica \u2014 all of which are found in igneous rocks \u2014 points to these rocks as the sources whence lodes have derived their riches. Dr. Le Xeve Foster is also inclined to believe that other lodes owe their origin to a gradual substitution of valuable minerals in the place of some of the contents of a worthless rock, perhaps by hot springs laden with mineral matter dissolving out these worthless materials and depositing in their room the more valuable ores with which they are laden. For instance, in the Great Flat Lode near Redruth in Cornwall, there is a slight fissure. But the \" country \" on either side of it consists of a rock impregnated with ore, the mineralised part of which fades away into the adjoining rock without there being any distinct wall. It is, however, more than possible that had the fissure here been broader the mineral would in time have been dissolved out of the granite in which it is contained, and transferred to the fissure. oxide of iron, \u2014 the ore may occupy \" pockets \" or \" chums \" in the rock.

The calamine \u2014 car bonate of zinc \u2014 deposits of Altenberg in Sar dinia, and the Iron Mountain and Pilot Knob of Missouri, may also, according to Dr. Foster, be taken as instances in point. The lead found in the sandstone beds of Mechernich, and the silver in the sandstone of Utah, were in all likelihood deposited with the sandstone, having been worked out of the decomposed rock in which they originally lay by the river or the sea waves to which these sands owe their origin, though, of course, they might also have been introduced by solutions per colating through the beds.

In various rocks we find extraneous sub stances, neither minerals nor fossils, some times of an origin contemporaneous with the rock itself, at other times the result of subsequent segregation. These concretions are most abundant in sedimentary rocks, though they are also found in those of ig neous and metamorphic character. Ore in masses, etc. \u2014 Finally, it ought to be added, that it is not always possible to exactly distinguish between the different kinds of mineral deposits here described. Some minerals are in beds, like iron-ore, copper bearing shales, lead-bearing sandstone, silver bearing sandstone, and diamond-, gold-, and tin-bearing gravels. But in every instance the materials thus laid down appear to have either infiltrated the beds after theh deposi tion, or to have been washed out of deposits formed in some other manner, such as the gold got in \" placer \" diggings by the decom position of the quartz, or the tin got by streaming, by the destruction of the vein in which it originally lay. Nodules. \u2014 These are of great variety, from the iron pyrites \u2014 the \" diamonds \" of sulphate of iron \u2014 which are found in so many sand stones and clay-slates, to the great nodules, or \" septaria \" \u2014 those flattened nodules of calca reous clay, ironstone, or other matter divided internally into \" numerous angular compart ments, by reticulating fissures,\" mostly7 filled with calcareous spar, which show well against the darker matrix of the nodules. These reticulating \" septa,\" or processes, arise most probably from the shrinking of the mass while in the act of consolidating, the cracks having been subsequently filled by limy matter infiltrating into them (Fig. 60). These argil laceous, calcareous, and iron-impregnated no dules are common in many clays and marls, such as those of London and Oxford, and in various coal shales in the form of bands. They are usually more or less flattened, and Occasionally also, as in the case of the red and brown deposits of h\u00e6matite \u2014 a native * J.A.Phillips: Quarterly Journal ofthe Geological Society, Vol. XXXV., p. 390; Philosophical Magazine, 1868, 1871, 1873, and 1874; and his treatise on \"Ore Deposits (1884), p. 73."], [124, "OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. 108 I rock. When a layer of loose sand is subjected to this influence the result is, of course, still more marked, and in those portions of France where suitable \" road metal\" is rare, the country people are in the habit of probing such sand stone beds in order to extract these nodules for the purpose of breaking them up to mac adamise the highways. generally contain some organic nucleus \u2014 such as a leaf, a shell, a scale, or a coprolite \u2014 which give them the popular name of beetle-stones, Thunder-stones. \u2014 In England the country folk know the flint arrow-heads of the ancient inhabitants, which they dig up in their fields, as \" thunderbolts,\" , and in other places the word is employed to designate the fossils about which the geologist has a great deal to say, under the name of belemnites. But in some parts of Germany the name is be stowed on the nodules found in the creta ceous \" Quadersandstein \" mountains of Reich stadt, in Bohemia, and other localities. These \" Knallsteine,\" or \" Knallkugeln,\" are of various sizes, from that of a gun-flint to that of a walnut, and present on the outside a fer ruginous crust, though internally formed of sand. They lie in the coal, and as they ex plode by the ignition of the contained gases, may, unless the greatest care is taken, be pro ductive of no small danger.

The septaria de rived from the London and Oxford clays, when burnt and ground, are used in the manufac ture of Roman cement. The term sph\u00e6ro siderite is a term applied to concretions of side rite or sparry carbonate of iron, which takes the shapes which have suggested for it the miner's name of \" kidney iron ore \" (Fig. 60). Penny -stones. \u2014 In clay ironstone, nodules varying from the smallest size to pieces of considerable magnitude, and known as pins or penny-stones, are often observed, the concentric cores of which are so loose that when struck with a hammer they rattle, leaving a hard central mass in this core, consisting of car bonate of lime or carbonate of iron, or small crystals of sulphide of zinc (blende), in the manner already described as existing in sep taria. In many7 clays \" marcasite nodules \" \u2014 I balls consisting of that variety of iron pyrites, and not unfrequently enclosing a fossil shell or plant \u2014 are common, though they also occur in some limestones, such as in the Lower Chalk of Folkestone, where Mr. Jukes- Browne thinks they may have been produced by the conversion of certain silicious sponges, called ventriculites, into iron pyrites. Indeed, the connection of iron pyrites with decaying organic matter is so constant \u2014 the marcasite nodules in clays being always more abundant Geodes. \u2014 This word was at one time very generally used to describe these nodules of hardened clay or ironstone, which were \"hollow within and filled with soft earthy ochre,\" or had \" a free nucleus or kernel, which rattled when the nodule was shaken.\" * They were the \" aetites,\" or eagle-stones of the ancients. But the term is now more generally restricted for the purpose of denoting all rounded nodules having internal cavities, either empty or with a kernel, or lined with crystals, which under the name of \" potato-stones,\" \u2022\" cat's-heads,\" and other equally appropriate names, attract the attention of the rustic. In sandstones under limestones are often found great hardened masses, due to the per colation of water into the lower bed, which has the effect of binding together the particles of sand with which it comes in contact more tightly than the other particles composing the * Page: \"Handbook of Geological Terms (1865)."], [125, "CONCRETIONS 109 when organic remains are numerous \u2014 that it maj7 be taken as a rule that such nodules are due to the decomposition of plants and animals. gorms, and other minerals rarely found in the rest of the granite.

Potato-stones. \u2014 These are dolomitised, or altered pebbles of limestone, hollow internally, and with their cavities lined with crystals of bitter-spar. Mr. Green regards the cavity as due to the contraction which the limestone has undergone in being converted into bitter-spar. Cone-in-cone. \u2014 We have, however, retained for the last a discussion of a \" concretional structure,\" perhaps the most remarkable of any hitherto described. This is the \" cone-in cone \" of clay ironstones. As the name sug gests, it consists of a series of conical forms often running together into rows and ridges, and consisting of concentric coats. The sur faces of the coats are marked by7 concentric ridges, giving them a wrinkled appearance so much resembling organic structures as to deceive some persons into the belief that these curious forms may7 be fossils.* The cones often occur in bands parallel to the stratification of the rock, extending upwards or downwards for a greater or less distances It may be added that some coals exhibit an interior structure not widely dissimilar, show ing when parted what Mr. Jukes described as \" a series of narrow, winding, corrugated ridges and furrows, about one inch wide and deep, fitting closely into each other till separated with some force.\" Flints and chert. \u2014 The only difference be tween these two is that the latter is more opaque than the former, and has its silica mixed with some calcareous matter. They are sometimes classed as concretions. But when we come to study the Chalk formation we shall find that though flints are not, as some times popularly described, \"fossil sponges,\" they are really due to the silica contained in the spicules of these sponges. Phosphatic nodules, often erroneously called coprolites, are found in some clays, and in sandstones and limestones, as ancient as the Lower Silurian. In the Gault formation, in the chloritic marl, &c, these nodules contain 60 per cent, of phosphate of lime, and are therefore of great economic importance as materials for the manufacture of manure. In Canada (p. 56), the nodules found in the Lower Silurian beds, and containing fragments of shells, are believed to be coprolitic, that is, the nucleus was the excretions of long-de parted animals. The origin of this cone-in-cone structure is still a theme regarding which various conflict ing theories have been formulated ; one writer attributing it to concretionary action, the re sult of a quasi-crystallisation : J another to the action of pressure on concretions in the course of formation ;\u00a7 while a third considers that pre cipitation meets all the difficulties ofthe case.|| Concretions in Igneous Rocks. \u2014 Concre- tions are, however, not confined to sedimen tary rocks, where it does not require any great acumen to detect how they might have been formed. They are found in igneous ones, though much less developed than in the other great series of formations. Here they are re garded as congenital \u2014 that is, due to some peculiarity in the crystallisation of the rocks, and not to any changes which have happened since they were cooled. For instance, in granite, little bits of mica, hornblende (Fig. 52), and rolled-clay pebbles, will be found embedded in the once liquid mass \u2014 -just as the \" clay galls \" are seen in the middle of a piece of sandstone \u2014 and cavities containing beryls, topazes, cairn- * Dawson : \"Acadian Geology\" (1868), pp. 676, 677. f Sorby : ' Report of the British Association for 1859,\" p. 124. + Judd : Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, Vol. XXIV., p. 418. \u00a7 Marsh: Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 1867 : s'iimbel : Zeitschrift ,1, r Deutsch.

Finally, it may be mentioned that, among other interesting observations by Mr. Young, he notes how in all the cones there is a central axis in which all the clayey layers converge to form a dark-coloured tube, tilled by the clay, and that through this orifice of the axis the sediment forming the calcareous lay7ers was successively ejected during each ebullition of the gas from below, the action being comparable to that of a miniature geyser. * This theory, though not quite con clusive, seems, in spite of the objections urged against its acceptance, the only one which explains in full accord with known physical laws the chief phenomena presented by cone in-cone. Mr. John Young, who has made what is by far the most exhaustive study of these curious structures, arrives at a conclusion regarding their origin somewhat different from that of any of his predecessors. He finds nothing in the structure of cone-in-cone to warrant the assumption that it was produced by pressure acting on concretions, or, indeed, by pressure acting on the stratum in any other shape ; nor that it is the result of any chemical pre cipitation from the water in which it was formed ; nor of a concretionary or other form of crystallisation in the stratum after the bed was deposited ; but he considered it to be due to the upward escape of gases through the sedi ment, resulting in a mechanical action whilst the deposition of the sediment was going on. It is also a structure which does not affect in the least either the immediately underlying or overlying stratum, and is confined vertically to the thin bed in which it exists, though it may, and does, extend horizontally with the bed over wide tracts of country. The gases which set this mechanical action at work appear to have been generated from the de composition of organic matter in the deposit. These gases, as they slowly escaped upward through the oozy and plastic mud, \" elevated the sediment around the several points of eruption into conical ring-like layers,\" the last feeble ebullitions being indicated at the upper extremities or bases of the cones by7 the little conical eminences \" which now rise above the regular surface of the bed. With the cessation of the escape of the gases from the underlying sediment the structure ceased to be further extended, although deposition of sediment, apparently7 of the same mineral composition, still went on in the waters in which the stratum was forming\" Thus each ebullition of gas was marked by a new or successive lay7er of sediment within each cone. The transverse wrinklings seen in the cal careous layers of the cones, appear to have been due to a creeping downward from \" the gravitation of the gradually hardening surface of the layer of sediment whilst it was still in a plastic state.\" Upon these corrugated, cal careous layers there have been successively de- Metamorphism. The reader who has read the preceding chapters must have seen that the rocks com posing the earth's crust nave undergone many changes since they were first laid down in beds by the action of water, or piled up into hills by the force of volcanoes, or accumu lated in the various ways already indicated. They have been ruptured and dislocated, twisted and percolated by mineral - laden springs, and into the cracks which run athwart their beds metals have been introduced. All these alterations might be termed metamor phism. t But the geological phenomena which are grouped under this head are of a more restricted character than those hitherto noted, and refer to the changes which heat in various forms, chemical action and reaction, pressure, and possibly electric and galvanic currents, have exercised on rocks unaltered except by the mechanical violence which has disrupted them in the way described. A brief study of metamorphism ought therefore to explain why chalks have, in various instances, become marbles, and sedimentary rocks been turned into the granitic-looking gneiss, or why slates * Young : Transactions of the Geological Society ot Glasgow, Vol. VIIL, pp. 1\u201427. f Greek meta (denoting change), morphe (form)."], [127, "METAMORPHISM, 111 can be split along lines of cleavage different from those with which a study of stratifica tion, or joints, or faults, has already made us acquainted. of course, greatly7 intensified by heat, and this heat we know is added to it in constantly increasing amounts as the water descends towards the interior of the earth. Even at so low a temperature as from 59\u00b0 to 172\u00b0 the mineral waters of Plombieres, in the Yos\u00b0;es, have in one week produced zeolites \u2014 minerals consisting of silicates of lime and magnesia \u2014 on the Roman brick pavement over which they flow, while other experiments by Daubree were even more strikingly in proof as to the remarkable influence which water of a high temperature will exercise on substances seem ingly the least easily affected. If to heat pressure be added, the result will be still more marked. Now, when, besides all these fac tors, the one of almost unlimited length of time has been allowed, the metamorphic action of water must be very great. We have already noticed the action of hot springs in producing the vein-matter of lodes (p. 107). Heat. \u2014 That heat exercises a metamorphos ing influence on the structures it comes in contact with is a matter of familiar knowledge \u2022J to every one. The prismatic texture assumed by the lining of furnaces after long-continued heat, has long been noticed, while the examina tion of a brick or a teacup shows how clay7s are consolidated or fused when they are \" baked.\" The \" vitrification \" of sand into a glassy mate rial is another peculiar case in point. Where trap or granite dykes have obtruded themselves, the rock on either side is \u2014 as we have seen (p. 100)\u2014 altered in structure, being as a rule rendered more crystalline than the unaltered mass. The high temperature, however, may7 be applied not by contact, as in the case mentioned, but by transmission in various ways, such as through the heat of a volcano, or by hot springs, steam, or other vapour, permeating for a long period the strata. Even cold water exercises a certain metamorphic influence on the rocks through which it percolates. It is found in more or less minute quantities in all rocks, even the quartz of granite being full of tiny7 water vesicles, of which only7 the furnace can deprive it. Some granites, indeed, con tain in their ordinary state a pint and a half in every cubic foot. Chalk is also highly7 absorbent, some forms of it being able to take up hah of their bulk without appearing to be moist. Ordinary sandstones hold nearly a gallon in a cubic foot, and, according to Ansted, in the best building stones belonging to the Sandstone group from four to five pints of water are contained in each cubic foot of the stone. The quantity of water capable of being held by common loose sea-sand amounts to at least two gallons in a cubic foot, while into the layers . of sand between the harder rocks so much water is always soaking that the driest seasons do not exhaust these reservoirs. By7 dissolving out certain chemical constituents in the rock, water must, therefore, exercise some alteration on the beds through which it per colates or in which it stands. This power is, Dolomitisation. \u2014 To the same action may7 be attributed the metamorphism of some rocks where no other action can be traced, and the conversion of an earthy limestone into dolo mite (p. 54), or even into ironstone, according to the substances which the hot water may hold in solution or in suspense. Dolomite * is not necessarily- a metamorphic rock, since we know that it maj7 be a chemical precipitate. But very frequently it has been converted from a limestone containing carbonate of mag nesia by the simple abstraction of carbonate of lime, or in various other ways by which carbonate of liine might be replaced by car bonate of magnesia. Thus the \" dunstone \" of the North of England and of Ireland is dolomite produced by the alteration of the carboniferous limestone for a few yards on either side of the joints running through it. However, where, as in the Eastern Alps, dolomite forms great mountain ranges, Sir Archibald Geikie and other writers are doubt less right in regarding them not as altered ordinary limestone, but in all probability as produced at the beginning \" by the action of * After the French geologist Dolomieu. Chemically. it is a more or less crystallised variety of magnesian limestone."], [128, "112 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. may be different. Various rocks are affected by cleavage, though most of them are of verv ancient date ; but the ones most familiarly \" cleaved \" are roofing-slates, the finest grained rocks being thus most markedly affected. In clay-slates the rock splits into the thin lamina' so well known, each plate being perfectly parallel with the one above and below it, and of equal thickness throughout. If it happens that fossils are in the beds affected \u2014 as in some sandstones and limestones \u2014 the shells or other organic remains are contorted also, showinsr O o that the alteration in structure has been undergone since the beds were laid down, and is in no way due to anything connected with its mode of formation. It is clear, after ex hausting all possible agencies, that intense compression, with motion ofthe particles com- the magnesian salts of the concentrated waters of inland seas upon organic or in organic calcareous deposits accumulated pre vious to concentration, their metamorphism having consisted mainly in the subsequent generation of a crystalline structure analogous to that of the conversion of limestone into marble.\". In like manner acid vapours and the gases issuing from volcanic cracks must have played some part in altering the struc ture of rocks, though it must be remembered that it is rarely that the agencies mentioned have acted singly. More frequently they have been in conjunction or in union with the second great order of metamorphic agencies, still to be described. Pressure. \u2014 The metamorphic agencies, dis cussed with the brevity which our space de mands rather than their importance merits, alter not only the physical but the chemical structure of rocks. We now come to a series of agencies which by rearrangement of the mole cules of the rock have succeeded in changing the texture mainly by the rearrangement of the materials composing the mass. These consist in pressure, combined, no doubt, with motion, and more or less with the other metamorphic influences just described. Rocks thus altered exhibit a peculiar fissile arrangement which enables them to be split in directions more or less oblique to the plane of stratification or bedding. Such a class of metamorphosed rocks is seen in the clay-slates used for roofing. Fig. 61. \u2014 CONTORTED STRATA. (Showing Planes of Cleavage [r\u2014t] obliquely to the Planes of Bedding or Deposition.) posing the rock, must have been the agency at work in producing this remarkable struc ture. In examining thin slices of roofing slates under the microscope, Dr. Sorby noticed that the granules were on the lines of cleavage flattened lengthways in their direc tion, so that the pressure which produced this flattening must have been great and ap plied laterally. In coarser-grained rocks this structure is easily seen, the pebbles of some conglomerates being flattened, so that their largest axis is parallel to the lines of cleav-. age and oblique to those of deposition, and, as we have seen, any fossils in the cleaved beds take a similar distortion. Professor Tyndall has produced cleavage in clay, white wax, and similar substances, by applying pres sure to them, allowing them at the same time to expand in directions transverse to the pres sure ; while contortion, according to the ex periments of Sir James Hall, must have arisen Cleavage. \u2014 Some sedimentary rocks \u2014 rocks in which the lines of bedding are perfectly clear \u2014 have cleavage planes more or less transverse to the ones in question. Not only do they, like joints, divide the bed in which they might be supposed to have originated, but they extend often parallel over a wide area, cutting through beds of various geological ages without any regard to the flexures which the beds have undergone (Fig. 61). The dip of the strata affected may7 be the exact opposite of that of the cleavage, while the strike may be different, or the dip of the plane of bedding and of the cleavage structure may point in the same direction, though the angle of their dip"], [129, "CLEAVAGE AND FOLIATION. 113 from lateral pressure acting with some degree of resistance from above and below. Still, though cleavage may thus be produced by the mechanical forces which have been at work in the earth's crust, it is by no means certain that heat has not also been concerned in it, or that this will explain all the pheno mena of the particles lengthening their axes in the direction of the cleavage planes. For convenience' sake this peculiarity of rocks has been bracketed under the head of the force which it is allowable to believe has produced cleavage, and, by some geologists, pressure is considered to have produced folia tion also. This, however, is an hypothesis it is not quite easy to accept. It is not difficult to imagine, as has been done, that foliation, if it consisted solely7 of a change in mechanical structure, could have been effected by7 me chanical force. But it is hard to realise how the same agency could have resulted in an alteration of the mineral structure of the rock itself. Yet this is what we see in foliation. In reality, cleavage is not always coincident with foliation ; while it is not uncommon to find unfoliated limestone and other beds intercalated with strata which have undergone that change. The belief is therefore gaining ground that only rocks containing alumina and magnesia are capable of producing the mica and felspar the lay-ers of which are so characteristic of this form of metamorphosed rocks. Nor does it invariably7 happen that the cleavage has been produced before the foliation, or that the planes of foliation coincide with those of cleavage ; but it may be readily understood that when the cleavage lines w-ere formed before the foliated structure was imparted to the rock, the mica and felspar would, under the metamorphic influences, arrange themselves along these pre-existing divisions. Cleavage, by its abruptness and frequently high angle, does not impress the scenery of a country to the same extent as the planes of stratification when they crop out in cliff's on one side and slope away on the other. Yet, as Mr. Tate notes, the actual direction of the great ridges is often due to the cause which has produced cleavage, and is not coincident with the strike of the bedding. On the other hand, the great ridges of strata are often cut through by cross-cleavage, so as to give passage to rivers flowing through narrow glens, wide valleys being more characteristic of the streams which have worn themselves beds in rocks unaffected by these divisions. It may be added that in some instances there have been noted secondary cleavage planes cutting across the first, and then when an igneous dyke or vein crosses a bed the line of cleavage runs across it without break, as in the case of a vein of \" porphyry,\" figured by De la Beche* crossing Devonian slates in Plymouth Sound. Foliation.]; \u2014 This has been defined as \"a separation into layers of different mineral composition,\" as distinguished from cleavage, in which there is only \" a tendency to split \" in a mass of the same composition. It may therefore follow the line of cleavage, or of stratification, or of the false bedding produced by currents, but, like cleavage, it has invari ably been produced since the rock was first formed. The \" schistose \" structure of many of the metamorphic rocks, like gneiss, mica schist, etc., is due to this foliation. What causes these alternating layers or plates of mineralogical structure has still to be dis covered. It may be that the electric earth currents have had some share in the matter. But, experience teaches us, the foliations are just as often coincident with stratification. In other words, the \" folia \" are parallel with the planes of bedding. Those who hold by this fact are inclined to attribute foliation to some force which was at work at the time the stra tified rocks were deposited. Sir Charles Lyell leaned to this hypothesis, while fully admitting \" that the alternate layers of quartz, or of mica and quartz, of felspar, or of mica and felspar, or of carbonate of lime, are more distinct in certain metamorphic rocks than the ingredients composing alternate layers in most sedimentary deposits, so that similar particles must be supposed to have exerted a molecular attraction for each other, and to * \" Geological Observer,\" p. 621. t Latin, folium, a leaf. 8"], [130, "114 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. have congregated together in layers more distinct in mineral composition than before they were crystallised.\" Finally7, the latest researches on the subject \u2014 namely, those of Dr. Sorby \u2014 go far to show that cleavage and foliation are essentially different, and that neither is in any way the direct result of stratification, cleavage being \" the result of the varying segregation of different minerals controlled by various previously-existing struc tures,\" the various appearances which folia tion presents depending, according to this distinguished observer, on whether or not the rock had become completely solid or crystal line before it was compressed, fossils, which are the remains of organic beings. Most of the Scottish Highlands, Scandinavia, and the Central Alps are regions in which metamorphic rocks prevail, though in these countries the metamorphism is not due simply to the strata having come in contact with vast masses of igneous rocks, in the same way that we have seen rocks altered by coming in contact with trap dykes, or similar masses of eruptive granite. Intrusive rocks of this character do occur, but not in such abundance, and of such magnitude, as to justify us in attributing this \" regional me- tamorphism \" to them. In such cases as those or was compressed before it be- came solid and crystalline. This, however, leaves the question pretty much where we found it : for it does not attempt to ex plain what the agency was that segregated these layers of mica and felspar from the substance of the rocks to which they now give so characteristic an appear ance.

(.After Ramsay). down or erupted (for some of the igneous rocks are also metamorphosed) in the limited man ner described, does not properly define those of any particular geological period. However, what has been long known to sy-stematic writers as the \"metamorphic system\" comprises the crystalline \" schists,\" such as gneiss, quartzites, mica-schist, and clay slate, which underlie the beds containing fossils, and out of which no traces of animal or plant remains have been disinterred, though, likely enough, they7 were at one time existing in these rocks. These beds often run into one another, and all alike bear the characteristic of being hardened and crystalline, and, for the most part, cleaved, foliated, and crumpled, after the manner already described. They are also known as azoic, that is, without life ; and hypozoic, that is, under the ones containing life, or of the Scottish Highlands and the Swiss Alps, the newest views tend to attribute their widely extended metamorphism to \" the com bined effect of great vertical and lateral pres sure acting under a high temperature, and in the presence of water or water vapour; such rocks being now exposed at the sur face in consequence of the removal of the material which once overlaid them.\"* (Fig. 62). The chief metamorphic rocks bear out the doctrines advanced in the foregoing pages. Quartzite is so termed, not that it has any connection with the quartz or the impure rock-crystal found in veins, but simply be cause the sandstone which it originally was, having had its grains of silica (i.e., sand) * Browne : \" Handbook,\" p. 447. See also Callawaj;, in. \" Science for All,\" Vol. III., p. 200."], [131, "METAMORPHOSED IGNEOUS ROCKS. 115 fused and agglutinated, bears a resemblance to the material from which it takes its name. and diabase, as metamorphosed igneous rocks, and mentions the white trap of the carboniferous rocks of Staffordshire and Central Scotland as basalt, much decomposed and assuming an earthy texture and a pale cream-coloured tint. In like manner, the true serpentines, for the term has been very vaguely applied \u2014 such as those of which the Lizard Serpentine in Corn wall is the type \u2014 (variegated, compact, massive rocks with glittering crystals of a variety of the mineral called enstatite) may be regarded as altered igneous rocks of the Peridotite group. In Forfarshire and Kincardineshire Serpentine traverses the old Red Sandstone in the shape of dykes. But when it is intercalated among schistose rocks and altered limestones, as in the West of Scotland, it is probably a dolo mite still further metamorphosed, though this is a question which it is unnecessary to dis cuss, enough having already been said re garding metamorphism so far as it concerns the physical geographer. Slate, as we have seen, is a clayey rock altered and exhibiting cleavage ; while Phyl lite is a glossier form of the same rock, and more metamorphosed than it. The Schists are \" foliated rocks splitting up into thin layers of different mineral matter.\" Thus, mica schist is the name applied when mica is predominant, quartz schist when quartz is most abundant, hornblende schist when hornblende appears, and so forth, throughout a long list of varieties. Gneiss, again, is a foliated rock consisting of quartz, fels'par, and mica, arranged in the layers characteristic of this description of meta morphosed beds, and comprising a number of forms, some of which are hard to distinguish from granites, and, indeed, are by some litholo gists classed among them. The metamorphism of limestone and chalk we have already noticed (p. 97), the marbles and dolomites being among the most famdiar results of these alterations, while anthracite and graphite \u2014 the \" black-lead \" of the pencil-maker (though in reality it is simply carbon) \u2014 result from the metamorphism of coal, though the exact conditions under which they have been altered are still open to discussion. Yet to show the difficulty7 of the subject we may add that Sir Wilham Dawson, who, by his long-continued researches has ac quired a prescriptive right to speak posi tively, is quite convinced that \" nothing can be more certain\" than that the Laurentian gneisses of Canada \u2014 in which is found the Eozoon canadense, a foraminifer so obscure that by several geologists it is regarded not as a fossil, but as a mere crystallisation \u2014 are not ordinary sediments metamorphosed. \" They are rocks peculiar in their origin, and not paralleled, unless exceptionally, in later times.\" Nevertheless, it is undeniable that they have been subjected to very import ant changes, more especially as to crystallisa tion* the state of combination of their ingre dients, and the development of disseminated minerals ; f and while this may in part be attributed to the mechanical pressure to which they have been subjected \u2014 this pressure Metamorphosed Igneous Rocks. \u2014 Among the metamorphosed igneous rocks we find several varieties of granite, though for the present we must be extremely careful in accepting the supposed \" facts \" which have been adduced in support of the theory that some of the granites are really only extremely metamorphosed varieties of gneiss. However, there cannot be any doubt that some true granites have been metamorphosed. Among them may be classed the one in which the mica and felspar are more or less replaced by tourmaline, as in the luxullianite of Cornwall (p. 91), or in the Zwitter rock of the Germans, in which chlorite, tin ore, and arsenical pyrites are added to the ordinary constituents of granite ; or in greissen, where the felspar mostly disappears, and lithia mica takes the place of the ordinary form.

These remarks, however, apply mainly to the Lower Laurentian gneisses. In the Middle and Upper Lauren tian we have metamorphic rocks \u2014 e.g., quart zite and limestone \u2014 which must originally have been ordinary aqueous rocks. Still more in the succeeding Huronian and its associated series of beds, and in the even more recent Lower Pal\u00e6ozoic, local meta morphic change has been undergone by rocks quite similar to those which in their unaltered state constitute regular sedimentary deposits. That these old gneisses were de posited not only in what is now the bed of the Atlantic, but also on the great continental areas of America and Europe, is evident to any one who considers the wide extent of these rocks, as mapped by7 Professor Hull. * the dip, strike, syncline, anticline, veins, etc., must be indicated by certain symbols, on the nature of which geologists are agreed ; while the character of the rocks themselves is usually indicated by colours. But as it is comparatively rare for any rock to be exposed for any distance, or over any great space, it is necessary to arrive at the data regarding its area by watching the places where it outcrops, or where it is exposed on the banks of rivers, in quarries, or in cuttings of any sort. Thus a fair inference may be arrived at regarding the spots covered by vegetation, or by the super ficial accumulations of soil ; though not un frequently \u2014 either by imperfect observation, or by hasty conclusions \u2014 important facts are left unnoticed by surveyors who have in this manner to piece a map together from frag ments of this kind. But we should obtain a very rude acquaintance with the geology of any country if we remained content with a mere flat map of the region examined. To ascertain how the beds lie, what is below them, how they are tilted or contorted, what are their strike, faults, and a dozen similar points, we must make an ideal section or cut ting across the country. This can some times be done with considerable ease by fol lowing the bed of a deep-lying stream. In most cases, however, the section (like the flat map) must be pieced together, some places being better exposed than others ; while at other spots, where the soil hides the rock, a skilful diagnosis from the bits cropping out will enable us to draw such a section for long distances or to considerable depths. Quarries, railway cuttings, wells, coal pits, river channels, and sea cliffs, afford the best data for this study. The result we see in such sections as those figured on pp. 73, 74, 75, 78, 80, 81, or in Fig. 63. Geological Maps. A few words on this subject are necessary before we begin a description of volcanoes, and the other agents which have been at work in moulding the earth in the past, just as they are engaged in re-arranging the materials at present. A map is simply a chart in colours or in conventional shading, representing the different kinds of rocks which make their appearance on the surface. To draw such a diagram it is, of course, neces sary7, in the first place, to have for the ground plan an accurate map of the country to be surveyed. In Europe and India, and in some of the more settled parts of the colonies and the United States, this is practicable. But in wilder countries, such maps not being forthcoming, the geological one that is drawn on the basis of those accessible is necessarily inaccurate, and therefore, though useful enough for the geographer's purposes, is of less value to the miner. The limits of each formation must be marked out ; It is, however, easy to see that the same representation on a geological map of a num ber of strata will have to be differently ex plained, according to whether these beds be, for example, anticlinal or synclinal. In the first case (Fig. 63a), 1 in the map would indi cate the oldest rock which formed the foun dation of an island figured, and around which * \" Presidential Address to the British Association at Birmingham,\" 1886."], [133, "117 GEOLOGICAL MAPS. the younger formations (2, 3) have settled down like a cloak or a belt, in much the same manner as the lines of equal depth surround the coast-line of a sea chart. This comparison might also be carried farther, in so far that the but, if it be drawn to scale, demonstrates that the breadth of a mountain's base is always greater than its height. Moreover, as Mr. Ruskin has shown very clearly, slopes of more than 30\u00b0 in angle are by no means frequent, and declivities of more than 40\u00b0 always consist of naked rock, while actual precipices are much rarer than is usually imagined if one may gather anything from the rhapsodies of Alpine tourists.* The ascent to the summit of a mountain being foreshortened, appears abridged to the eye surveying it from the base, and conse quently the steepness of the mountain from the bottom to the foot is ordinarily much exaggerated by the imagination. Thus, the Alps rise from the plain at an angle of from 3\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and the Pyrenees are not much steeper. With an ascent of 5\u00b0 a carriage road becomes difficult ; when the angle rises to V it is impracticable. A man climbs rather than walks up an ascent of 30\u00b0. Etna, for example, though standing on a base of thirty miles, and with a slope of only 10\u00b0, cannot be ascended in one day7. The sides of a volcanic cone often make with the horizon an angle of 30\u00b0 or more ; but these form exceptions to the general rule holding in great ranges. Limestone ranges often spring abruptly from low ground, and with precipices \" spread out above into elevated plains, so that their alti tude, compared with the area covered by them, is not usually great.\" Indeed, so gradual is the general ascent of mountains, that after tramping for ten miles, it is rare for the climber to find that he has \" made \" more than one-tenth of that distance into the upper air.f Fig. 63. \u2014 DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING THE FORMATION OF A GEOLOGICAL MAP. outlines of 1 and 2 were really, during the settlement of the next formation, actually coast-lines, if w7e suppose an unchanged sur face of the sea, and that the land has, step by step, risen during the accumulation of these formations. In the second case, when the beds are synclinal (Fig. 63s), 1 in the map will represent the youngest formations, and appear to be the last material filled into a water basin, originally much larger, in which the formations 2 and 3 have been accumulated at an earlier period.

In reality, all times are geological. The corals are rearing islands on the shoulders of ancient volcanoes ; the icebergs are bearing rocks far from the spot where they were de tached as moraines from the sides of the valley through which the glacier ground ; the glacier streams, laden with mud formed by the detritus of the rocks over which this vast file moved, are filling up the Arctic fjords in the same way that their more southern predecessors of the Glacial periods did, and very likely, under the great \" inland ice \" of Greenland \u2014 which is the exact counterpart of the ice-cap of Scot land in the geological period referred to \u2014 is forming that boulder clay which has so long puzzled those geologists who attempted to account for it without reference to causes still in operation. In the preceding chapter we have seen that the beds of rock, or the masses which are not arranged in layers, present certain charac teristics, and that these characteristics can with few and very minor exceptions be ex plained by the action of forces still in opera tion. What is more, there is no reason for believing, from what we see in the earth's crust, that these agencies have ever been at rest, or that since first we obtain glimpses of the story of creation any new laws have come into operation. In brief, the modern doctrine of uniformitarianism \u2014 that is, that every phenomenon we have noticed in the rocks, or may still have to study, is due to the uniform play of those \" geological forces \" which the Creator has permitted to act throughout unnumbered ages \u2014 lies at the foundation of the science. In themselves these forces may sometimes appear slight, but their combined action going on continuously has, as we shall see, been amply sufficient to explain the eruption of the igneous rocks, the wearing down and deposition of the stratified ones, their disruption, contortion, and meta morphism, and the successive birth and disap pearance of the plants and animals which were contemporary with them, and are now more or less entombed in these rocks in the shape of fossils. The volcanoes are still, as they always were, vomiting forth ashes, lava, and other exuvi\u00e6 of the underground world ; the strata are still being so continually broken and faulted by earthquakes, that there is pro bably no part of the world which is not, or has not been, within the limited period of which history takes cognisance, subject to one or more shocks. The sea and its waves, The ice-grooved rocks of Norway and of Great Britain, and such roches moutonrdes as that which every year a thousand tourists see in the stone near the first bridge in Borrowdale, must be studied not by drawing on hypothetical causes, but by examining the same sort of scratches and ice-worn rocks in the Arctic regions, in Switzerland, or in some other part of the world where Nature still acts through the same agents as those which left these memoranda of their operations behind them. It is, therefore, necessary to study what has been termed geological dyna mics \u2014 volcanoes, earthquakes, glaciers, rivers, and the like \u2014 in order that we may understand"], [135, "APPEARANCE OF A VOLCANO. 119 the causes of what we have described, and shall still have occasion to study. Here, ac cordingly, geology meets geography. In the next few chapters the one will be inseparable from the other, for the present explains the past, and the facts deduced from the past prove how long the so-called modern agencies have been at work. a word literally meaning cup ; the molten matter, ashes, and other discharged matter rising from the interior reservoir through a pipe or chimney, w-hich extends through the one, which cone, again, is formed of the ac cumulation of ashes, lava, and other debris vomited during ages, and rests on the origi nal rocks through which the volcanic dis charge first took place (Figs. 55, 64, 65, 68). The Vulcanism of the Earth. These eruptions appear to occur periodically7. Periods elapse during which no discharge takes place. The volcano is then \" dormant.\" Vege tation fills up the crater, crops are gathered on its sides and at its base, and the volcano appears to be \" extinct,\" like those of Auvergne in France (Fig. 64), and the Eifel, between the Rhine and the Moselle, in Germany. But sud denly some rumbling noises are heard. Ex plosions occur, water vapour and gases are ejected, and the volcano is said to be steam ing. The next stage is when the burning mountain is said to \" smoke \" and \" spit fire,\" though considerable intervals may elapse be tween these stages and the great eruption of ashes, lava, and other materials which follows. Among the most notable, though perhaps not the most powerful, of the agencies which have always been at work reasserting the materials of the earth's crust, and bringing to the surface matter which lies beneath it, are the volcano and the earthquake, two forces intimately united, and which conjointly have been designated vulcanism* Alex, von Hum boldt defined this as a reaction of the internal core of the earth against the surface, this reaction being due to earthquakes and the causes which produced them. The exact observations which have been made enable us, if not to predict or to guard against these disturbances, to deduce some laws resrardincr their occurrence. We know, for example, that when a volcanic eruption oc curs it will run a certain course, and \u2014 after discharging its steam, scori\u00e6, and lava \u2014 -will cease, it may be for a short period, or for ages. We can also sometimes predict from certain signs that an eruption is on the point of occurring, though no deduction has yet been formulated which enables us to say that at a given hour, or day, or month, an earthquake may be looked for ; but no doubt it has been attempted to show that in certain seasons and in certain weathers, these tre mors of the earth's crust are more frequent than at other times or under different at mospheric conditions. These periods are long or short, the interval between two eruptions being great, and then the lapse between those which follow being comparatively brief and regular. Etna, for example, which is 10,867 feet high, f makes pauses of from ten to twelve years, during which time no eruption takes place. Strom boli, in the Lipari Islands of the Mediterranean (the cone of which is 3,022 feet high), has for the last 2,000 years been in constant activity, though there are Quaternary formations form ing in places where at one time slag and ashes were ejected. It is, therefore, rather excep tional ; for Sioa in the Moluccas, Tofua in the Friendly Islands, and Sangay and Cotopaxi in the Andes (Fig. 65), are among the few vol canoes of which the same can be said. Yet the explosions occur with such rhythmical regularity of from three to ten minutes and Appearance of a Volcano. \u2014 This is so marked that almost every one is familiar with it from pictures. A volcano is a mountain wherein periodical eruptions occur. These eruptions take place for the most part through an opening in the summit known as the crater, f According to the new map of the Stato Maggiore (3,312'61 metres). Smythe determined it to be 10,874 feet; while Herschel, thirteen years later, though un acquainted with his predecessor's work, estimated it at only eighteen inches less. * Of course, from Vulcan, the God of Fire."], [136, "120 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. fifty years later, an earthquake occurred which severely damaged Herculaneum and Pom peii. Others followed at intervals, until the 24th of August, a.d. 79, when the first re corded eruption occurred, the violence of which was such that the country was desolated for miles around, and Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabi\u00e6, and other villages in the vicinity, were upwards, that visitors can approach the crater without danger, stones ejected from it almost all falling into the opening again. Vulcano, in the same group, the crater of which is constantly smoking, is said during some of its more recent eruptions to have displayed a periodicity of from twenty to thirty minutes ; though, as a rule, it does not display the Fig. 64. \u2014 PUY DE LAS SOLAS AND PUT DE LA VACHE (EXTINCT VOLCANOES IN THE PUT DE DOME CHAIN), AUVERGNE. overwhelmed by the showers of ashes and the vast streams of volcanic mud which poured down the sides of the mountain. Up to the year 1500, nine eruptions are on record. Since that period it has often been quiet for long intervals ; then for a period it has been almost uninterruptedly active. Of late, the pauses have rarely exceeded three to four years, and during these outbreaks the eruptions display a periodicity in their convulsive efforts of much the same cha racter as those of Etna.

Hualalai, after three outbursts early in the present century, has indicate a resumption of volcanic activity after a period of very long quiet, though, relatively speaking, the results so produced were not great, and the activity was diffuse, and comparatively feeble. Similar evidences of volcanic eruptions, long after the vent Fig. 65.\u2014 COTOPAXI. was believed to be extinct, have been dis covered in some of the more recent volcanic fields of the Kocky Mountain regions. Distribution of Volcanoes. \u2014 Alexander von Humboldt has carefully catalogued the number of active volcanoes which appear to have been in eruption during historical periods. From the results of this inquiry it would appear that out of 407 active volcanoes only 225 can be counted as having been in been dormant since 1811. Mauna Kea seems to have reposed for centuries, and the natives have no traditions of Haleakala, on the Island of Maui, having ever been active, while Mauna Loa is apt to discharge its great lava rivers at uncertain intervals. But on the other islands the volcanoes have long been extinct, and already are being worn away by the elements. In Oaha, however, Dutton noticed recent cinder cones which appear to"], [138, "OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. 122 the Rhine, in the vicinity of the Laacher See* and in the Eifel, we also see some groups of extinct volcanoes.

The old continents- Europe, Asia, and Africa, and their islands are thickly studded over with extinct or active volcanoes, though none are known to exist in Australia. But the great volcanic basin of the earth appears to be in the bed of the Pacific Ocean. From Mount St. Elias in the north, to Mount Erebus and Terror in the south, a range of volcanoes can be traced in the ocean, so that we may say that the earth is from sea to sea girt with a volcanic belt. This zone of fire comprises the west coast of North and South America, from the Aleutian Islands to the Peninsula of Kamtchatka, and extends across the East Indian Islands to the Gulf of Bengal \u2014 each of these groups of islands being full of volcanic vents, and possessing an aspect peculiar to itself. We may further notice in the Pacific Ocean a number of sur faces which occasionally exhibit the same phenomenon as on the continents. But, naturally, w7e know less of this water-covered portion of the earth's surface, though we can imagine that if the terrestrial influences are not favourable for the occurrence of many volcanoes, the chemical and mechanical opera tions on which they depend are not suspended The newer tables of Dr. Fuchs give 672 volcanoes, of which 270 are now active (80 in America, 24 in Asia, and 20 in Africa, or its islands, only one being on the Continent of Europe), the difference in the two estimates being due to the different opinions held re garding what constitutes an active, a dormant, or an extinct volcano. In Java, for example, there may have been counted 109 volcanoes, of which 28 are now in activity. In the Isthmus of Auckland, in New Zealand, in a space of 128 square miles there are as many as 63 small, scarcely extinct or active volcanoes, of from about 196 to 990 feet in height, each of which possesses its own distinct crater and lava system. In the Phlegr\u00e6an fields, near Naples, Breislack has counted 27 craters. In Auvergne, in Velay, and Vivarais, in France, and on the banks of We see, in fact, that the volcanic action is so distributed that it is possible to refer the vents to one central part from which all of them diverge. The first and greatest of these lines stretches, we have seen, from near the Arctic Circle to the Bay of Bengal, comprising the Aleutian Islands, Kamtchatka, the Kuriles, Japan, the Philippines, and the Malay Islands. Its greatest focus of activity * This lake is in the crater of an old volcano."], [139, "DISTRIBUTION OF VOLCANOES. 123 seems to lie in the region between the islands of Borneo and New Guinea, which has often been the scene of most violent eruptions and earthquakes. From this centre, one line radi ates through the Philippine Islands, a second in an opposite direction through New Britain, the Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides, New Zealand, and South Victoria, where Mount Erebus belches fire over the Antarctic snows, while Java and Sumatra form the principal land surfaces in the line of the third branch. Finally, a fourth band has been traced along the eastern coast of Africa, where Mauritius, Bourbon, Rodrigues, and the Red Sea vents form the most marked features in the line noted. Again, if we study the map on which these volcanic openings are portrayed, we may clas sify them as (1), Central Volcanoes (comprising isolated volcanoes and volcanic groups), which would include the volcanoes of Iceland with those of the Canaries and the Azores, the Cape Verde Islands, the Sandwich Islands, the Galapagos, etc. ; and (2), the Chained Volcanoes, which are uniformly disposed in single lines. Thus Vesuvius indicates the southern point of a line about 200 miles long, stretching from the west side of the Apen nines in a north-westerly to a south-easterly direction, and along this volcanic line it is not too much to infer that volcanic force is still existent, and may at any time display itself Examples of chained volcanoes may also be seen in Sumatra and Java, the volcanic series of the Moluccas and Philippines, the three-fold volcanic lines of the Peninsula of Kamtchatka (where there are yet active vol canoes with a mean height of 15,000 feet), and the volcanic chain of the Kurile and Aleutian Islands, which contains 36 volcanoes. Still more important is the great volcanic line of 2,800 miles in length, which runs along the western coast of South America, with volcanic vents in Chili, Bolivia, and Ecuador. In Cen tral and North America it is very7 manifest. In Guatemala the vast rents which often tra verse the plains for miles, tell of past earth quakes, and the ancient capital of the State is situated between the Volcan de Agua and the Volcan de Fuego, the latter still occa sionally active. The Yzalco Volcano, in San Salvador, is also now and then in eruption, and Nicaragua is traversed in its entire length by a remarkable volcanic chain of isolated cones, several of which are active, or at least only quiescent, the tropical vegetation at their base being little more than twenty years ago \u2014 as the w7riter can testify \u2014 covered with the ashes which fell during an eruption of these great burning mountains. In Mexico A second band of volcanic action extends along the west coast of North and South America. A third traverses the Atlantic, from Green land and Bear Island \u2014 where volcanic rocks occur, though no active volcanoes \u2014 by way of Jan Mayen, on which is a volcanic peak (the Esk) still occasionally in eruption, Iceland, where Hecla is the principal active vent, the Azores, the Canaries, the Cape Verde Islands, St. Paul, Ascension, St. Helena, Trinidad, and Tristan da Cunha \u2014 on all of which there are either volcanoes in a state of activity, or which may be regarded as dormant or extinct. In Great Britain and the opposite portion of the Con tinent there are no active volcanoes. Yet Skye and Mull must during the Tertiary period have been the scene of violent volcanic disturbance, for though worn down by the action of the weather and other denuding agents, it is still easy to trace in these islands the \" basal wrecks \" of the old cones (p. 102). In many other regions, during different geological periods, volcanoes must have existed. Indeed, wherever we find volcanic rocks there the volcanic vent must have been present. From the volcanic band just de scribed the volcanoes of the Mediterranean, including Etna, Vesuvius, Stromboli, San torin, &c, are a branch. Thus it appears that the first of the vol canic lines named stretches for nearly7 10,000 miles, and, with its' branches, contains 150 active volcanoes ; the second includes in its range of 8,000 miles about 100 active vents, and the third contains about 50 active volcanoes, scattered over a length of nearly7 1,000 miles."], [140, "124 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. earthquakes are common, and Jurillo, in 1759, was in eruption. Popocatepetl emits smoke, and within historic times has been in activity. Orizaba has been quiet for more than three centuries, and though Colima is still often a.ctive on a small scale, Tuxtla has shown no sign since 1793, Avhile Jorullo, though it may at any moment vomit forth fire, is at present exhibiting few symptoms of renewing its wonted energy7, and the district in its vicinity is again becoming covered with vegetation. Ferdinand von Richthofen, after a study of the facts ascertained, has arrived at the follow ing conclusions regarding volcanoes and their relationship to the geological structure of a country: (1), Volcanic action \u2014 that is, earth quakes, as well as the more outward manifesta tions of the underground movements \u2014 is most marked in those regions where the continents turn their points towards each other, and are either already joined together, or, by a slight elevation of the land out of the sea, are gradu ally becoming so (Central America, Alaska, Kamtchatka, the East India Islands and Au stralasia, the Turkish Peninsula and Asia Minor) ; (2), That volcanoes follow the abrupt margin of continents (Western line of the Andes and Cordillera, the Philippines on to Liu-Kiu, Japan, and the Kuriles, which may be regarded as dissevered portions of a former continental land mass) ; (3), That they keep near either the present sea-coast or the sea coast of the Tertiary period, albeit volcanoes may burst through rocks of every age. In Auvergne, for example, they have pierced the granitic and metamorphic rocks. In the Eifel, Devonian and other old beds have been pene trated ; in Italy, Etna and Vesuvius have erupted through the newest strata ; while in western North America the vast lavas and tufas of Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, are for the most part overlying Tertiary and post-Tertiary rocks. (4) Lastly, an exception to this rule is afforded by those evidences of volcanic action found in some few plateaux, which for long periods have had no outlet for their water courses to the sea \u2014 for example, the \"great basin\" between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains just mentioned. In the western United States there are several more or less active, and a number of extinct volcanoes, the truncated cones of which form so striking a feature of the Cascade Range and its continuations from Alaska southward. Mount Baker, in Washington Ter ritory, as the residents of Victoria know well, is often smoking and vomiting fire, and the Indians have traditions of Mount Hood and other peaks having been in violent eruption within the memory of man. Their summits still display all the signs of vulcanism \u2014 hot ground and springs, steaming spots and ashes, while lava is to be seen in the country at their base, and washed up among the gravels of the streams flowing out of their snows. Between the Cascades and Sierras and the Rocky Moun tains is a markedly volcanic region. The \" lava beds \" cover a great portion of the coun try in the vicinity of Fort Hall. Boiling springs are plentiful both here and in British Columbia, where there are no active volcanoes, though here, in common with the entire Pacific coast, earthquakes of a mild character are frequent. But in Alaska \u2014 or, as some recent astronomical observations would indicate, actually over the British Columbian border \u2014 Mount St. Elias has been occasionally in eruption,* and off the coast submarine volcanoes connected with the group in the neighbouring Aleutian islands, or on the other side of Behring Strait, every now and again give evidence of their activity. In brief, there are few breaks in the volcanic chain which extends from the Arctic to the Ant arctic Oceans. Outward Form and Size of Volcanoes. The mode in which a volcanic cone is usually formed \u2014 namely, by the debris vomited out of the crater on the top falling down the sides \u2014 renders it for the most part of a very uniform shape, and enables the lava streams to flow down its sides into the lower lands after a fashion much the same in every case. For a like reason, * Seton Kan- in Xosmos (San Francisco), Vol. I., pp. 3-6, and Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, March 14th, 1887."], [141, "VOLCANOES : CONE AND CRATER. 125 the dimensions of cones are easily7 examined. The angle which the slope describes to the horizon varies from 3\u00b0 to 40\u00b0, the shape of most of them being very slender. The crater is produced by the same force which ejects the products of eruption. Once it is formed in the shape of an opening in the rocks through which the pent-up material is ejected, it is kept open by the same agencies. 17,717 feet. Mount Erebus, in the Antarctic regions, is 12,400 feet. In the Old World we have Kliutchevsk, in Kamtchatka, 15,825 feet; the Great Ararat, 16,431 feet; the Peak of Teneriffe, 12,182 feet ; Vesuvius, 4,250 feet ; Etna, 10,867 feet; and Hecla, 4,532 feet. Some volcanoes barely rise more than a hundred feet above the surface of the soil. Among these diminutive members of a lordly race, are Kosima, in Japan, 745 feet high ; and Mandana, in the Santa Cruz or Queen Char lotte Islands of the Western Pacific, which is 213 feet in height. The Cone. \u2014 But, meantime, the debris gradually accumulating all around it, the cone grows like a molehill on a large scale, while the original crater lengthens, until it is con tinued downward through the cone in the fomi of a pipe, or chimney, which at one extremity communicates with the interior of the globe, and at the other is the vent at the top, through which the material passing through it during an eruption finds its way into the air and down the sloping sides of the cone. In this way a cone may be of a greater or less extent, its height depending not only on the amount of material ejected, but on the constancy with which the erup tion has been continued, the nature of the dibris vomited out, and the fact that the volcano has not, during some of its violent moods, formed fresh craters, either on its side or at a little distance, as it not unfrequently does. Nor must we omit to note that some times a lofty peak is suddenly truncated during a violent eruption by the volcanic force blowing off the top of it, and thus (p. 120) the fresh eruption, instead of adding to its height, ac tually diminishes the altitude of the cone. The Crater. \u2014 The crater of a volcano is merely the opening through which the erupted matter finds an outlet, and through its downward continuation serves, as we have seen, to unite the outer world with the pyro sphere or internal volcanic forces, of which the volcanic discharge is the external manifesta tion. The dimensions of craters vary much. Estimates have been made which prove that in some of them the mouth is over three statute miles in its greatest diameter. The crater of Vesuvius is about 2,034 feet ; that of Stromboli, 2,100 ; that of Etna about 2,300 ; and that of Popocatepetl, in Mexico, 5,578 ; while the crater, or, as Captain Dutton insists on calling it, the \" caldera,\" of Kilauea, in Hawaii, attains the enormous diameter of 12,795 feet. But in reality- this is a lava lake, rather than an ordinary crater or blow-hole, the usual orifice through which lava and other volcanic matter emanate. All the ac cessories of Kilauea are different from those associated with normal craters. Counterparts of this caldera are not common. The Val del Bove in Etna appears to be homologous to it ; and in the Sandwich Islands the exact counterpart of Kilauea is the great pit on the summit of Mauna Loa, named Mokuawe oweo. The vastly larger depression on the summit of Haleakala, though differing much in form, may also be regarded as identical. Numerous small crater-shaped depressions are found in many parts of Hawaii, which also seem to be of much the same nature, though some of them are only a few hundred feet in diameter, and none of them exhibit any signs of Some of the South American volcanoes attain the maximum elevation of their order. Thus, Chimborazo is 20,703 feet high ; Coto paxi, the loftiest active volcano in the world, 19,498 feet ; and Sahama, 22,350 feet, all of these mountains being in the Andes. Mount St. Elias is 14,970 feet,* Mount Rainier 14,444 feet, Mount Baker 10,760 feet, and Popocatepetl * According to the Admiralty Chart (No. 2,172) ; Teben hoff makes it 16,938 feet ; Grewingk, 16,754 feet ; the Russian chart of 1848, 17,854 feet ; D'Agelet, 12,672 feet ; and Davidson, \"between 16,700 feet and 17 000 feet;\" while Schwatka's expedition of 1886 indicates its eleva tion at \"between 19,000 and 20,000 feet, with a probable error of 1,500 feet.\""], [142, "126 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. 13,900 feet, due almost entirely to the gradual overlaying of one lava discharge by another, lava being the main matter ejected by them. These mountains differ from the ordinary conical volcanoes in being flat and wide- topped like a concave shield. To an elevation of from 4,200 to 4,600 feet, the slope rises almost imperceptibly from an angle of 1\u00b0 to 5\u00b0, when the incline becomes somewhat sharper, but still remains under 15\u00b0. Higher up, the mountain again becomes flat, so that at a distance the summit appears convex, and the whole volcano in shape like a flat-roofed house. The calderas, or lava lakes, of these mountains are, as we have seen, of enormous size, that of Mauna Loa being 12,140 feet in dia- meter, though it has in addition a side crater of a remarkable character ; while Kilauea mea- sures in its circumference more than 7i Eng- lish statute miles (Fig. 67). In some of the large volcanic cones, such as that of Etna, or the Peak of the Island of Pico, in the Azores (7,613 feet), there is not only the main cone, which forms a continuous mountain, but a number of smaller parasitical ones arranged around them. Each of these may give rise to its own lava stream, and throw out its owa special shower of ashes. In Etna as many as 700 of them \u2014 little and big \u2014 have been counted. recent activity. Their origin seems to be due to \" the dropping of a block of the mountain crust which once covered a reservoir of lava, this reservoir being tapped and drained by eruptions occurring at much lower levels.\" Hence, in Captain Dutton's opinion, when people speak of Haleakala as \" the greatest Fig. 66. \u2014 THE ISLAND OF HAWAII, IS THE HAWAIIAN OK SANDWICH GROUP.

Mauna Loa, for example, to go no farther than the Sandwich or Hawaiian Islands, is 13,700 feet high, and Mauna Kea ribs. These appearances are due to the ero sive action of water, which has flowed down from the summit, which, while it has washed away the softer ashes and other debris, has left the harder lava ribs untouched. Such phenomena are exhibited, among other places, in the Gunung Sumbing of Java, in Cotopaxi *Dutton : \" Hawaiian Volcanoes.\"\u2014 Beport of the United States Geological Surrey, 1882 \u2014 3, p. 105."], [143, "RIBBED AND RUINED VOLCANOES. 127 in the Andes, in the Hawaiian cones, in most of the Cascade Mountains of North-west America, and in Mount Egmont in New Zealand (Fig. 68). The streams of water flowing from a height descend, in their course, in ravines, which have a definite relation to the axis of the summit crater, for this is the central point from which all of these streams course. point.

The crater is, however, not always so regular or sharply7 defined as on its first formation. Soon the process of erosion by the elements begins to work, breaking down its sides, so that in time it will appear like a huge kettle which had its origin from the falling in of tho side crater of the volcano. (See also Plate V. ) Ruined Volcanoes. \u2014 This leads us to remark that every volcanic cone that has long been exposed to the action of the weather exhibits evidences of that erosion and denudation which wind and rains and the other aerial agents are constantly producing. Such erosion is shown in the gullies and ravines along the sides of cer tain cones (p. 126) ; and in the South Pacific, Dana describes some of the cones of long quiescent volcanoes as so worn down that their outer slopes display little more than narrow ridges, with nearly7 vertical walls, separated by flat-bottomed valleys, which gradually contract towards the interior ; and \"at the head of each valley may be seen a little rill of water leaping from crag to crag, still carrying on,\" Mr. Browne remarks, in commenting on this passage, \" the work of erosion to which at first sight it seems so utterly inadequate.\" Of course, if the vol cano continues active at short intervals, the loss by the weather is soon recouped by the fresh material ejected.

On the other hand, if it is spared this last misfortune, traces of the crater and volcano generally will remain for unnumbered ages, as the well-marked extinct volcanoes of Auvergne, in Central France, and the Eifel, in Central Germany, so abundantly prove. The entire plain of the Limagne dAuvergne is dotted with these silent cones and dome-shaped hills, to the extent of about seventy, the average height of which varies from 500 to 1,000 feet above the level of the plains. But highest and most remarkable of them the Puy de Dome is 4,000 feet high, though the shape of the cone and the lava stream may be even more easily traced in some of the smaller ones, such as the Puy de Come, 900 feet high, which looks as if it had been in eruption only a few years ago. The crater of Mont Dor, 6,000 feet in height, is so ruined that the only traces of it consist of a group of seven or eight rocky summits, circling round an area of about three miles, while the sides of the cone are channelled by deep ravines and subsidiary watercourses, which, in the course of long periods, during which the crater has ceased to belch forth the entrails of the earth, have cut deeper and deeper into the ashes, lava, slag, and other materials which are disposed here, just as they are in more modern cones.* Those of the Eifel, not to enumerate other less marked portions of Europe, are equally notable, some of the best preserved being easily seen by the tourist who takes the picturesque road from Gerolstein to Cochem, on the Moselle. Indeed, on the other side of the Kyll, opposite to Gerolstein, the Papenkaul affords a good speci men of a small extinct crater, from which a little stream of lava flows through a grassy valley into the romantic Kyllthal. Not far away is the Dreiser Weiher, a marshy meadow, notorious for its exhalations of carbonic acid gas, and the nodules of olivine, which, like the gas, are evidences of the volcanic agency so long at work in the neighbourhood. A mile from Dreis, close to the village of Dockweiler, is the Erensberg (2,198 feet), an extinct vol cano, from which descends a broad stream of lava, and all over the adjoining region cones, craters, or portions of craters, slag, lava, ashes, overlying Devonian limestone, attest the ac tivity which at one time prevailed in this now somnolent regions The cones may be formed of various mate rials. They may, for example, be built up of fine dust and stones, consolidated by pressure aided by water, or of mud, or of lava (like so many in the Sandwich Islands), or of a mixture of these materials, or even, as in the case of some of the Eifel cones, of nothing more than the fragments of the rocks through which the pent-up steam or gases had forced a way. Again, looking at them from a broader point of view, we may regard cones as falling into two great categories : \u2014 (1), Those in which, like the majority of volcanoes, the cone is built up of the materials ejected ; and (2), the domed ones, composed of a homogeneous mass of lava, unmixed with other materials, and without anything in the shape of a crat3r or chimney7, though it is quite possible that at different periods in their history the one might partake of the character of the other, and rice versa. \\ Ringed Volcanoes. \u2014 It will sometimes happen that during a violent outburst the top of the cone, which it has taken centuries of f Hibbert : \" Extinct Volcanoes of the Basin of Neu wied, on the Lower Rhine \" (1832) ; Von Dechen : \" Geo gnostischer Fiihrer zu dem Laacher See\" (1864), and \" Geognosticher Fiihrer in das Siebengebirge \" (1861) ; Vogelsang : \"Vulcane der Eifel\" (1860), &c. * Scrope : \" Geology and Extinct Volcanoes of Central France\" (1858) ; Lecoq : \" Epoques geologiques de l'Au vergne \" (1867).

At that date the peak now known as Vesuvius seems to have been formed. Before that occurrence the mountain had been topped by a rounded crater, the south side, where Vesuvius now rises, having been the lowest. This crater now encircles Vesuvius with the half ring, called Monte Fig. 70.\u2014 SOMMA AND VESUVIUS. THE ONE ENCIRCLING THE OTHER.

But as this cone will naturally be smaller than the piece blown off, the new one will appear, for a time at least, encircled by the summit of what remains of the old one as if by a ring, between which and the new cone reared inside of it there is a vacant space. Many examples of this vol canic appearance are afforded by existing volcanoes. For instance, a good illustration of such a composite volcano is seen in A esu vius. We have already learned (p. 120) that the first recorded eruption of this mountain Since the year 79 the summit of Vesuvius has undergone several changes, sometimes after an eruption, a single crater, and some times two or three craters close to each other, making their appearance. The mountain itself, which rises from the sea at an angle of 10\u00b0, while the cone has a gradient of 30\u00b0 \u2014 35\u00b0, has not much altered, though its height has undergone some change after 9"], [146, "130 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. as the newer cones formed within the ring of the older ones, composed of Santorin and Therasia (Fig. 72). nearly every great outburst (p. 120).

Then a succession of eruptions took place during the night, and were scarcely noticed until it was seen that a little volcano"], [147, "RINGED VOLCANOES. 131 had developed on a miniature island, which was named after King George of Greece (Fig. 73). This George volcano became so defined that Nea Kaimeni, adjacent to it, grew into an island formed out of the debris vomited forth, and in time the lava and other erupted matter formed the tiny islet of Aphroessa. In the second half of February, 1866, the . activity of the volcano ceased, and was lying in the channel between Nea and Mikra Kaimeni, received on its fore-deck a glutinous lava-bomb, and was covered with dust : while a small vessel lying in the neigh bourhood was driven on Santorin, where the captain was killed, the timbers of the ship were destroyed, and the whole ship was en gulfed in the flames.

They7 were much louder than thunder, though the tone acted on the nerves like the shrieks of a shrill fife. This noise was produced by7 the emission of steam and gases through a small aperture. At a distance of 9,000 feet, the rubbish and ashes that were ejected from this miniature volcano were found to include many blocks of lava. The houses near Kaimeni were entirely destroyed, and a large block of lava damaged the Catholic church.

The new volcano showed itself as a rounded body, about 354 feet high, and with sides at an angle of 32\u00b0, covered with ashes and great blocks of rock. Near the peak, and half-way up, there were noticed yellow-green streaks of sublimed sulphur, which covered the ashes with a fine dust, indicating that the sulphurous smoke pressing through the crater walls was accom panied with free hydrogen, largely evolved by Santorin and other vol canoes, and probably the source of the lambent flames already noticed.

From day to day the stony crest of Santorin altered, and, according to the varying shapes of its crater, exhibited various changes of form.

Finally, though the island of St. Paul, in the Indian Ocean, is, in common with Santorin, a good example of the result of a submarine volcanic eruption, it also serves as a not inapt type of a volcanic cone with a parasitic cone and crater, and of a crater which has formed the bosom of a lake, in this case of salt water, though in the instances to be presently described the craters are filled with fresh water (Fig. 74). Crater Lakes. \u2014 A crater is, as the word means,t a cup, and every cup left long in the open air will sooner or later get filled with water derived from the rainfall. Accordingly, this has happened in the case of many old Santorin is believed to have been elevated at least 900 feet above the sea, since first it was disturbed by volcanic action, for in tufas of that height marine shells have been found. But there is also evidence that at the time it was blown up by that explosion \u2014 or \" He ph\u00e6stus \" as the islanders, using the old divine * Arch.

The sides of the crater being unbroken, and the basin itself extending to a considerable depth, the snow collects and melts in the hollow; the rain and springs also often contribute to the supply. The result is a deep lake in the cavity out of which fire and boilino rock at one time belched (Fig. 75). To render the crater fitted for holding the water and as some of them are now surrounded by vegetation, it requires a practised eye to detect their real character. They are, however, found in many parts of the world, though those most familiar to geologists are in Au vergne, Central Italy, and the Eifel, where they are known as maare. In all parts of the district last mentioned they are very well marked. Accordingly, a Fig. 75. \u2014 CRATER LAKE OF TAAL IN LUZON, ONE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. thus accumulated, the pipe leading down to the old internal reservoirs of volcanic matter must, of course, be stopped, and the walls of the basin composed of tolerably impervious matter; while a certain depth and internal shape are requisite, otherwise the water would escape, and, by7 breaking down the walls in the manner described (p. 126), not only prevent the formation of a permanent tarn, but soon render the crater unequal to the formation of a lake basin. Hence, as not a great many craters combine all of these conditions, the number of \" explosive lakes,\" as they are sometimes called, is comparatively few in proportion to the number of extinct volcanoes ; few remarks may be added on the most notable of these, derived from personal obser vation, supplemented with details selected from the ordinary sources of information on the topography and geology of the Rhineland. A few miles from Daun, a village surrounded by slag hills, lava streams, volcanic sand, \" lapilh,\" \u2014 i.e., small, round nodules of lava \u2014 and mineral springs, is the Fbrmerich crater, filled with ashes, from which runs a lava stream, on one branch of which, taking the columnar form, the castle of Daun is built. But the three Dauner Maare are more to our purpose. The Gemiindner Maar is 1,282 feet high, and about 200 feet deep. The Weinfelder Maar and the"], [150, "134 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. bonic acid gas arises. In the thirteenth cen tury an inundation of the Laacher See having threatened the abbey lands of Laach, the monks sunk a shaft in the south side of it by which the superfluous water was drained away, and another sunk in 1845 lowered the level of the lake twenty feet. These crater lakes of the Eifel are sometimes at the bottom of deep valleys, sometimes on the summit of hills, and frequently on an intervening platform, and the volcanoes to which they owe their existence seem, for the most part, to have burst into eruption after the present system of hills and valleys had been formed. Lyell, in noting this, remarks, as less scientific tourists must have done, on the suddenness with which one comes upon them in travelling through the district. No sign of volcanic action more than usual is observed when unexpectedly the pedestrian. finds himself on the very edge of a crater, and down below the deep, clear water gleaming, when it can catch a glimpse of the passing sun. Indeed, the comparatively small amount of true volcanic materials in so extremely volcanic a district, indicates that the force which tore up the strata was gaseous explosion, attended with a moderate discharge of lava,. but much glistening volcanic sand and pumice. This, with fragments of lava, pieces of burnt shale, slate, and sandstone, and numerous trunks and branches of trees, forms the basis of the tufaceous alluvium locally known as \" trass,\" which covers large areas in the Eifel, ani chokes up some valleys. It seems to have been. formed during the period of the eruptions. The Lonar Lake, half-way between Bombay and Nagpore, is another noteworthy crater basin. It is over a mile in circumference, and from 300 to 400 feet in depth, but the actual water in it is shallow, and of a saline bitter ness, though it is evident that at one time it was very much fuller. Schalkenmehrer are both larger ; but the latter being drained by the Alfbach is not more than one hundred feet in depth, though, like most of the lakes, it is full of crayfish and different species of fish. The Pulvermaar of Gillenfeld is about 300 feet in depth, and surrounded by banks of volcanic sand, tufa, and the loose form of lava known as scori\u00e6, though the immediate walls of the crater are chiefly the ejected matter and shale and sand stone through which the old volcano burst, the lake itself lying at a depth of about 150 feet below the surface. The Meerfelder Maar, though hollowed out of similar strata, and surrounded by heaps of pulverised shale, con taining few volcanic substances proper, is of much greater size and depth than those named. It is nearly a mile in diameter, and was at one time nearly 500 feet in depth, though now almost entirely drained. The scori\u00e6 and sand of the large lava mountain called the Mosen berg, with its four craters (the northernmost of which was formerly filled with water, but, after being drained in 1846, now yields peat), are also found in the heights around this maar. Passing from the Upper to the Lower Eifel, we come to the famous Laacher See, six miles in circumference and 173 feet deep in the centre. This lake, however, though generally classed among the crater water-basins, is now generally believed to have been formed by an eruption of the wooded Veitskopf, a volcanic peak with a double crater and a broad lava stream. Sir Charles Lyell, however, seemed to have regarded the Laacher See as a true \" maar,\" for he notices its resemblance to the Lago de Bolsena and others in Italy, in so far that it is surrounded by a ridge of gently sloping hills, composed of loose tuffs, scori\u00e6, and blocks of a variety of lavas.* Not far from the lake is a \" mofette,\" or hollow, whence a suffocating stream of car- * A fuller account of these lakes may be found, so far as their topography is concerned, in all the best guide books to the district \u2014 especially the familiar \" Baedeker \" and \" Murray.\" Their geology is, however, more exhaustively treated in the works already noted (p. 128). But for English students there is no better short description than that of Lyell in his \" Principles of Geology \" (4th Edit.), Vol. IV., pp. 49-61, which is practically the same as in his later works, though better illustrated. Recently another remarkable crater lake has been discovered on Kilimanjaro, a snow capped mountain in Central Africa, which is little short of 19,000 feet in height. This is Lake Chala, about three miles long by one wide, lying at from 400 to 800 feet below the level of the summit, and with banks so steep that"], [151, "CRATER LAKES. 135 a descent to the water is impossible, except at one place on the western side. But though the lake has no apparent inlet or outlet, being fed by rain and melted snow, the water is clear, cool, and perfectly sweet. It contains numerous fishes, and is frequented by flocks of water-fowl, the flapping of whose wings produces a noise, through confused rever beration in the deep, wen-like basins, like the rushing of a distant railway train. The cries of the birds had a peculiar sound, and Mr. Wray, who reached the edge, had no doubt that it was their noises which gave rise to the native myth, which tells how a Masai village formerly stood here, but was swal lowed up by the tarn, the people of Taveta believing that they hear voices, the lowing of cattle, the bleating of sheep, and so forth.* cup or hopper \" on its summit, and, though covered with timber, still very little eroded. Two streams of lava stretch out from its base towards the great wall, but do not reach it, so that the insulation of the cone and its lavas is still complete. The water is of an intense ultramarine, and reflects in the most perfect form every portion of the circling cliffs. But it is not so much the beauty of this picturesque spot which commands atten tion as the interesting geological features which it exhibits. The island in the centre is in all likelihood a cone, which at one time rose high above the encircling walls of the Somma-like old crater surrounding it (p. 129). But Captain Dutton does not venture this opinion. All that he suggests is that the crater is a \"caldera\" (p. 125), formed by the summit of the old cone having been removed, either as those of the volcanoes of Hawaii have been (by the lava draining oft' through openings miles away and thousands of feet below the summit, thus depriving the upper portion of the mountain of the liquid support which held it up, and compelling it to sink into the caldera), or by the top being bodily blown off (as, among other instances, in the truncated cones of the East Indian Archi pelago, more particularly Papandayang in 1772, and Tomboro in 1815). The outburst of the latter surpassed even the tremendous outbreak of Krakatau in 1883. Prior to this eruption Tomboro, on the island of Sumbawa, was a sharply-defined cone rising to the height of 9,000 feet. But in a single night the upper 5,000 feet were blown into frag ments, which were scattered over thousands of square miles of land and sea, while the volcanic dust darkened the air over a million square miles of island and ocean. When the scene could be visited in safety, several months later, Tomboro was \" a mere stump of a mountain, with a large crater, or cal dera, in the place of the cone which had been blown away.\" But the most remarkable of all the crater lakes is one in the Cascade Range, in Southern Oregon, of which the writer believes that he for the first time, some thirty years ago, in dicated the true character. The lake, accord ing to the latest and most accurate descrip tion \u2014 that of Captain Dutton, of the United States Geological Survey t \u2014 is about seven and a half miles long and five mdes wide, in shape nearly elliptical, without bays or promontories, and girt by a complete crescent of cliffs, varying in height from 900 to 2,200 feet, in which the only narrow spaces for lodgment are the gullies that the rains have scoured in the perpendicular walls. Visible outlet has not been discovered, and the only feeders of it, besides the snows and rains, are the little rills of water flowing from springs in the faces of the walls. But as the evaporation in this part of the world is less than the pre cipitation, there must, as in all of the crater lakes of Europe, be some underground mode of escape for the superfluous water. This crater is, moreover, a specimen of the ringed variety, for in the lake is a cinder cone 600 or 700 feet high, having \" the usual * Proceedings ofthe Royal Geographical Society, 1887, p. 47 ; Thomson: \" Through Masai Land \" (1885), pp. 217, 229.

Vast quantities of it have been gathered up by the rivers and streams (for it is lighter than cork), and swept eastward into the broad basin of the Klamath Marsh and Klamath Lake, or carried westward through the Rogue river into the Pacific. The finer lapilli and sand have been consolidated into beds which flank the eastern side of the Cascades, and are found on the western slope in the flatter spaces beyond the base of the truncated cone which holds the crater and its lake, while the tuff' has weathered into \" pleasing columnar forms.\" Most probably the mountain, before it met with its mishap, was not a sharp or lofty cone \u2014 like Mount Pitt and Mount Scott to the south, and Mount Thielson to the north \u2014 but like so many of the Cascade peaks \u2014 Union Peak, to the east of it, among others \u2014 of a dome shape or flatter form (p. 128). water in the world, unless, indeed, similar tarns may be discovered in some of the many unexplored volcanic ranges of the New World. Though this is, to some extent, anticipating the discussion of lakes proper, it may be well to give in this place a comparative list of the depth of other lakes, but it ought to be noted that some of those which appear shallow, compared with the one described, are in reality even more interesting, since they are not due to volcanic agency, but to erosion by glaciers, or to the other means which (we shall learn in time) have been at work in forming the spaces now occupied by sheets of fresh water :\u2014 The only difficulty in accepting this inge nious theory \u2014 and the difficulty is of Captain Button's own raising \u2014 is that, we do not find the corpus delicti, as we might expect to do when a cone of solid lavas, such as now line the Crater Lake, was \" blown into rubble,\" and the fragments hurled far and wide over the surrounding country. No fragments have been noted, except such as are usually found at the foot of steep spurs and ridges of volcanic rock. Yet it is hard to divest oneself of the conviction that this admirable observer is right, with or without the adden dum regarding the secondary cone forming the island which we have proposed. Some of these depths are, however, doubtfuL For instance, the maximum depth of Huron must be considerably higher if, as is said to be the case, soundings have been taken to 1,800 feet without finding bottom. As for Lake Baikal, a judicious geographer will main tain a discreet scepticism towards the depth given. * Nor are these lakes without their geo logical as well as their geographical interest Let us suppose that one of them was emptied by any internal disturbance, whether in the shape of an earthquake or a volcano. The The depth of Crater Lake is, on an average, 1,490 feet, though the soundings vary from 853 feet to 1,996 feet, with the probability that there are spots exceeding this in pro fundity7. But so abrupt are the walls of this tarn that at four or five hundred yards from the shore the lead sinks to fifteen, and even eighteen, hundred feet all round the margin. Crater Lake is thus the deepest body of fresh * Le Conte, in Science, Vol. VIIL, No. 200 (1886), p. 51\". Some Russian surveyors put the maximum depth of Lake Baikal at upwards of 300 fathoms, i.e., 1,800 feet\u2014 though likely enough there may be holes in the bottom stretching to almost any profundity.

Indeed, volcanic ashes and other debris, and fall in the shape of a peculiar deposit, which would cover the surrounding country, though its origin might puzzle the geologist. That such an event is quite possible is proved by several facts worthy of notice. In the first place, such a catastrophe seems to have happened at some former period in the history of the Eifel volcanoes. The \" trass,\" which covers large areas of the Eifel, is an"], [154, "138 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. much the same facts have been recorded of Cotopaxi, Tungaragua, and Sangay. In this particular instance the top of the cone is said to have fallen in, so that if, as is not unlikely, a lake had accumulated in the old crater, the mud must have been of very recent origin. At all events, when fishes are found, it is perfectly certain that they could not have been long in a reservoir of mud. The \" moya,\" though it sometimes escapes from the crater, and sometimes from openings on the side of the cone, is also of surface manu facture. This is shown at once by the fishes which it so often contains being the same as those found abundantly in the neighbouring streams above ground. The chances are, therefore, in favour of its being an accumulation of much the same character as those already indicated. Finally, there is no reason for supposing that the vast out pourings of mud by which the Java volcanoes are distinguished are essentially different in their nature. We know that crater lakes are found in those regions. For example, during the eruption of Idjen, in 1817, an accumulation of this kind, not and charged with volcanic acids, was emptied down the slope, and, after the eruption ended, re formed, though the water, instead of being hot, was of nearly the normal temperature. In 1800 Guntur discharged an acid torrent, and also rivers of mud. At times wide tracts of luxuriant vegetation have been buried under masses of \" dark-grey mud, sometimes 100 feet thick, with a rough, hillocky surface, from which the top of a submerged palm-tree occasionally protruded.\" t In the second place, what has once happened may at any moment happen again. Whenever a volcano is quiescent for any length of time and its crater suitable for the collection of water, and the country in which it is situated not too arid, then it is almost certain that a crater lake will, in one shape or another, make its appearance, though it is not often that the nearly every volcanic eruption is accompanied by more or less water. This in many cases comes from the crater lakes, or from reser voirs which have accumulated still deeper in the earth, and been disrupted by the explo sion, and, when mixed with volcanic dust and ashes, it forms the \" mud lava,\" so dreaded of the people in the vicinity. It was this \" lava d'acqua,\" as the modem Italians call it, not the true lava and melted rock, which in a.d. 79 enveloped Herculaneum in its \" tufa \" folds, and which in 1822 buried many of the streets and houses of Ottajano and Massa. The \" moya \" of the Andes may, no doubt, in some cases be of a similar origin. But in the majority of instances it is due to the melted snow and ice sweeping down the side of the mountain in eruption, tearing up great ruts in its course, and carrying before it the vege tation which has sprung up during the period of quiescence. During an eruption of Coto paxi, in June, 1877, villages miles away from the mountain were buried under the moya, mixed with lava, ashes, wood, and all the other debris which it had met with in its headlong rush. Indeed, so rapidly did it travel that great blocks of ice survived the voyage into the tropical lowlands. The mud discharged from so many of the Central and South American volcanoes may be traced to water gathering in places near the crater, and then getting thickened into mud by the loose volcanic dust and ashes which are so plentiful in such quarters. Then, when the outbreak comes, the accumulation is sent skyward. But in other instances the volcanic discharge may tap lakes or ponds of pure water. This must assuredly have been the case in 1691, when Imbaburu, an Ecuadorian volcano, emitted floods of mud, so plentifully charged with dead -fishes that the stench which arose from their decay gave origin to a pestilence in the town of Huera. Seven years later, Carguairazo, a lofty peak in the same range (17,500 ft.), sent torrents of mud out of the crater, this mud containing im mense quantities of a species of fish known as \" Preiiadilla \" (Pymelodus cyclopum)* and t Archibald Geikie : \"Text-Rook of Geology,\" pp. 21\u00ab, 217; De la Reche : \"Geological Observer,\" pp. 366-406; Daubeny : \" Description of Active and Extinct Volcanoes,\" p. 409. * It appears to frequent dark caverns."], [155, "A VOLCANIC OUTBREAK. 139 accumulation of water is on the surface, or in so picturesque a form as in the examples cited. More frequently the rain and melted snow find their way into some subterranean cavity, there to wait the time when they will be evicted by the forces from beneath. Most likely it was some such underground reservoir which, on the night of September 11th, 1541, gave way during an outbreak of the long dormant Volcan de Agua, in Guatemala, and swept the greater part of the ancient capital into ruins and drowned thousands of the inhabitants. Nor is there any ground for believing that some such catastrophe may not recur. Indeed, though the volcanoes of the Eifel are characterised as extinct, Yogelsang has given us reasons for suspecting that the volcanic energy beneath the \" maare \" is only slumbering, and may, when least expected, rouse itself out of its uneasy sleep. CHAPTER VII. Volcanoes: their Phenomena, History, and Products. General Phenomena of Volcanoes \u2014 Preliminaries of an Eruption\u2014 Etna as an Example \u2014 Products of Eruption\u2014 Steam and Gases \u2014 Reservoirs of Gases in the Earth \u2014 The Petroleum Region of the Caspian\u2014 Scori\u00e6 and Ashes\u2014 Volcanic Bombs \u2014 Lava \u2014 Eruption of Hawaiian Volcanoes \u2014 Some other remarkable Eruptions in Sicily and Java. The general phenomena (Fig 76) attending a volcanic eruption will have been inferred from the details given. The rumbling sounds mentioned are usually the first sign of some- thing going to happen, and not unfrequently earthquakes precede the first outburst. If the volcano does not act all the more pre- cipitately, subterranean water-courses and an irregular ebbing and flowing of the sea will sometimes indicate the disturbance going on underneath. But this is not always the case. Often the first intimation of the mischief to follow is a loud explosion, followed by an ejection of steam high into the air, and then falling in a few minutes in the shape of rain. About this period the scared dwellers in the vicinity think it prudent to flee from the wrath to come, for soon after, dust, ashes, and stones are ejected, followed by larger blocks, sometimes of old lava, or of the rock through which the volcano originally burst, and the so-called \" volcanic bombs,\" while flames appear to play round the summit. These flames are, no doubt, frequently lighted hy drogen or other gases, though in many instances they are simply the reflection of the molten lava rising up in the funnel of the crater, and giving a refulgent glow to the misty clouds and steam hanging over the summit. All the time explosions con tinue. But soon the lava begins to pom down the sides, out of the summit crater, or from some collateral openings in the side. After this pumice and black sand \u2014 like the \"augite sand\" of Stromboli \u2014 generally very finely comminuted, succeed ; but in not a few cases the first outburst of steam, and the dust, ashes, and stri\u00e6 which follow, constitute about all the phenomena of the eruption ; while in other cases, after the steam has heralded what is coming (the steam being really the boiled water in the crater, or that of some subterranean cavity), the lava begins to pour over the cup (or crater), into which it wells up. This is the' case in the Sandwich Islands (Fig. 76), where lava is the principal product ejected. In the Icelandic volcanoes there is also an immense discharge of lava ; while in the Italian ones the ashes and other minor ejections predominate. In Etna the course of an eruption is tolerably regular. Earthquakes generally pre sage them ; then come loud explosions ; rifts and bocche del fuoco (literally, \" mouths of"], [156, "140 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. other substances to follow, but the various gases continue to be ejected as long as it lasts. The steam forms the \"stone pine-\" like cloud which usually hangs over a cone, and, combined with the gases, greatly contri butes to the loud explosions and the other noises which are such marked features in every volcanic discharge. It may even happen that after a time, as in the case of the solfatara, near Naples, steam and gas \u2014 in the case in question sulphurous acid \u2014 will be discharged. The gases are mainly carbonic acid, hydrochloric (muriatic) acid, and the sulphurous acid gas which is so commonly associated with volcanoes, the evil-smelling sulphuretted hydrogen, and boracic acid; besides free hydrogen, which is believed to cause many of the explosions in the funnels of volcanoes, and the detonations and ejec tions of steam which follow; nitrogen, and ammonia. There are also secondary products springing from the combination of these gases with each other and with substances which they meet with in their way to the outer world. Thus, when sulphuretted hydrogen comes in contact with sulphurous acid, sulphu- ' ric acid (oil of vitriol) is formed and sulphur deposited. This sulphur is found in greater or less abundance in eveiy volcanic region; while sulphuric acid, by combining with soda, lime, etc., forms the various sulphates of those substances which have already been more or less passed under review (pp. 67, 68). The amount of steam discharged depends entirely upon the amount of water which the volcanic heat finds to convert into vapour. This may be greater or less, according to circumstances, though, as even the driest of rocks contains much (p. Ill), we need not be surprised at the steam ejected by one of the parasitic cones of Etna having been calculated to amount during an eruption of 100 days to 462,000,000 gallons of water. The source whence the gases are derived is not quite so obvious, though, as the earth con tains reservoirs of many of them, it is fair to conclude that they owe the fact of their being ejected during an eruption to the same me chanical causes which send the water with fire \") open on the sides of the mountain, and smoke, sand, scori\u00e6, and ashes are discharged. Then the action usually localises itself into one or two craters ; cinders are thrown out, .and accumulate round the crater in a conical form ; ultimately lava rises through the new -cone, frequently, Mr. Rodwell tells us, break ing down one side of it where there is least resistance, and flowing over the neighbouring country7, carries before it .great blocks of old lava, until to the casual observer it appears to consist simply of a river of debris borne down the slope. Then the eruption is at an end ; and of the eighty or more on record, very few have diverged from this routine, or have been of extreme violence. Indeed, most of the outbreaks of this volcano \u2014 \"famoso, im menso, terribile,\" as it has been termed \u2014 have been of a slight and comparatively harmless character (Fig. 77). Products of Eruptions. We are now in a position to discuss more fully7 the materials mentioned, and the con ditions under which they are ejected from the volcanoes. Some of them, we have seen, are merely the ordinary obstacles which the force causing the eruption meets with in its course, such as the rocks through which it bursts, or water, either as water or as water con verted into steam. In other cases they are the materials of the upper crust, or of the interior beyond our reach, which have been altogether transformed by the action of the heat which universally accompanies a vol canic outburst. Among these the various gases, the ashes, and, above all, the lava, may be mentioned. It may be added that though the amount of any one of the substances which will be briefly described in the follow ing paragraphs varies in every mountain, in very few are they entirely wanting, though in the sudden turmoil which accompanies and follows the phenomena which form the theme of these chapters, one of them, if not very prominently present, may escape notice. Steam and Gases. \u2014 Steam is invariably dis charged during an eruption, though generally, as we have seen, as the forerunner of the"], [157, "volcanic gases. 141 which the volcanic force comes in collision into the air.

And here, day and night, the oil-fountains pour forth their hideous black streams. The supply may well be deemed inexhaustible, inasmuch as 12,000 square miles in this region are found to be oleiferous, and of this vast sur face only six miles have as yet been deve loped. The oil-bearing stratum extends be neath the Caspian Sea, where it crops up in Tchelikan, a true Isle of Oil. Here the oil literally streams into the sea from hills and cliffs which may be said to be formed of ozokerite (p. 64) \u2014 in other words, of crude paraffin. In the Caspian, not far from Baku, there are a number of gas escapes which when lighted set the entire surface of the sea in a blaze. On the eastern shore of the Caspian petroleum reappears at various points \u2014 as, for instance, at the Nest or Naphtha Hill, where the deposits are officially valued at \u00a335,000,000 sterling. Then, again, as Baku lies at the eastern extremity of the Caucasus range, so at its western extremity lies an oil-field ex tending over about 250 miles. It terminates in the peninsula of Taman, between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azoff \u2014 a region abound ing in active \" mud-volcanoes \" and occasion ally shaken by earthquakes. Early in the year 1887 the fire-giant, this Asiatic Ence ladus, who tends the great laboratory beneath the Caspian, seemed disposed to emulate the example of his brethren in New Zea land, Tonga, and Hawaii. Hitherto he had been satisfied with such sport as turning on an oil-stream like that which gushed forth three years before from one of the Baku springs, spouting with such force as to break to pieces a three-inch cast-iron plate which had been fastened over the well in order to divert the flow to a different direction. A neighbouring oil-spring, on being tapped, threw up a column of petroleum to twice the height of the Great Geyser in Iceland, forming a huge black fountain 200 feet in height \u2014 a fountain, however, attributed solely to the removal of the pressure on the con fined gas, as there is no perceptible heat in these geysers. It was visible for many miles \" struck,\" and indeed they are not unfre quently found associated with coal-beds in England and elsewhere. In various parts of the United States they are employed to light mines and smelt iron, and for other economic purposes. When present in great quantity7, they will frequently force water and petroleum to the surface in the form of a geyser ; and, indeed, it is not uncommon to see such a boring alternately discharging gas and water or gas and petroleum. The petroleum region of the Caspian is well known, though it is not till within the last few years that it has become the scene of a great industry in this substance. The vicinity of Baku has from time immemorial been deemed sacred by the the Hindoos ; and for at least 2,000 y7ears the sacred earth-fed flame has burned un ceasingly, and the temple of Sarakhani been a centre of reverent pilgrimage to the adher ents of the ancient faith of India.* This native naphtha flows from the sod in so pure a form that it burns without rectification, and is, indeed, so inflammable that the naphtha gas occasionally ignites spontaneously, and plays in pale flames above the fissures in the rock. \u2022On stormy nights these flames have been seen to blaze up with an awful spirit-light which, in the eyes of the superstitious, invested the spot with special sanctity \u2014 a sanctity intensified by the fact that here, according to Arabian chroniclers, a great volcanic mountain was in full action till 800 years ago. Since then the thermal forces have expended their en ergies on spouting oil, and therewith saturat ing the desert plain of the Apsheron Penin- * By a curious, though not unaccountable, mistake, this temple has been generally described as that of the Zoro astrians, or Fire-Worshippers of Persia, who in India are known as Parsees. In reality it is a Hindoo idol temple, like the fire temple of Juwalla Mukhi in the Punjab. The Russians have extinguished the flame \u2014 the gas being too useful at their factories to be kept blazing \u2014 and now it is only lighted for the amusement of visitors. Colonel Stewart, from whom we derive this information, declares that he never heard of any Parsee visiting the temple, and the Zoroastrians in Persia take no interest in it. There was at one time an idol in it ; now the Persian Fire- Worshippers have nothing to do with idolatry. Moreover, the inscriptions on tha wall are not in Pehlevi or any form of Zend, but in the Sanscrit character."], [159, "VOLCANIC GASES. 143 around ; and on the first day it poured forth about 50,000 barrels, and, with gradually diminishing volume, continued to play for five months, when it finally subsided, leaving its unfortunate owners (an Armenian com pany) well-nigh ruined by the claims brought against them by neighbours whose lands were destroyed by7 the oil-flood. One house which stood near the spring now lies buried be neath a sand-hill (the cone of this \" mud volcano\"), which alone marks the site of this too prodigal fount. Quite recently a still mightier naphtha-flow suddenly commenced playing with such vigour that a number of buildings were swamped. For some days it -continued altogether uncontrollable, and fears were entertained for the safety of the town of Balm. Then a still more appalling terror appeared in this region, where there is so enormous an amount of inflammable matter that one might well dread the kindling of the most carefully guarded flame. On the night of the 5th of February, 1887, the inhabitants of Baku were awakened by a violent shock which caused all the windows to rattle, and .suddenly the darkness of the night was illumined by7 an intense light, as though the city were aflame. It proved, however, to be but the reflection on the heavens of a great fire at a distance, whose origin does not seem to have been comprehended till the following night, when the same awful glare became visible ; and shortly before midnight a terrific \u2022explosion was heard, immediately7 followed by -a vast column of flame, about 350 feet in height, which shot up from the summit of the Lok Batan, close to the Ponta railway station. It was a calm night, with scarcely a breath of wind ; so the flames continued to ascend quite vertically7, carding large masses of dark matter, which fell back into the crater. Con siderable heat was felt at the distance of fully a mile, and the whole country was lighted by a glare brighter than that of the ;sun at noonday. This lasted for about thirty hours, but not continuously, the column oc casionally subsiding. The volume of liquid mud ejected in this period has overspread a track of about a square mile to a depth vary- ing from 7 feet to 14 feet* On the 22nd of March there was another explosion exactly similar. In other words, this was a discharge of gas from one of the two \"mud- volcanoes\" from which it ordinarily escapes near Baku. This class of phenomena \u2014 entirely different from the mud-discharging craters already de scribed \u2014 may, however, conveniently be dis cussed in another chapter. Again, every volcanic region seems to be charged with carbonic acid gas (carbon dioxide). This we have seen to be the case in the Eifel (p. 128), and the story of the Upas Tree Valley in Java, out of which no man could escape, though for the most part an invention, in reality owes its origin, not to the known cir cumstance of the Antiaris being a poisonous plant, but to the fact that in a valley in that island carbonic acid oozes so plentifully out of the soil, that the ground is strewn with skeletons of animals which have incautiously ventured into it and been suffocated by the poisonous stratum of the heavy gas lying over the earth like the thin mist which gathers in a valley towards evening, though in this case the fog being transparent it is all the more dangerous. Even in Vesuvius, Sir William Hamilton has put cases on record in which pheasants, hares, and other small game, were killed by7 breathing the emanation oozing out of the cracks on that volcano, and, in 1730, all the cattle in the island of Lancerota, one of the Canaries, were destroyed by the deleterious emanations from the volcanic soil. But there are other gases connected with a volcanic eruption which are more directly dependent on it. As Bunsen, Leblanc, Sainte- Claire-De ville, Foque, and other chemists, have shown, the amount and the order in which these gases are given off follow in tolerably regular sequence. For instance, lava as it cools and hardens sends forth hydrochloric acid, chlo rides, and sulphurous acid ; next steam, and then carbonic acid and combustible gases. In other words, the nature of the discharged vapours depends on the activity of the volcanic vent * Miss Gordon-Cumming in St. James's Gazette, Feb. 15th, 1887 ; Col. Stewart, in Murray's Magazine, April, 1887."], [160, "144 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. so often heard around active volcanoes are no doubt due to the explosions or escapes through narrow passages of these pent-up gases. When the Crusaders passed Stromboli, on their way home from Palestine, they affected to have heard the cries of poor souls in Purgatory, proceeding out of the centre of this volcano, which is regarded as the entrance to that land of expiation, imploring the monks of Clugny to say masses on their behalf. It was this tale which induced Odilo of Clugny to institute the and the temperature of the underground scene of its activity, chlorine indicating the most violent stage, sulphurous acid a less active one, and carbonic acid the fact of the energy being reduced to its lcwest ebb.* It is found, more over, that volcanic discharges are attended with certain electrical phenomena, owing, it is believed, to the electricity developed by the friction of the uprushing current of steam against the walls of the crater funnel, and to the collision of the fragments of rock against each other. Lightning, for example, often plays round a volcanic crater in eruption (Fig. 70)> and in the earliest stage of the discharge loud claps of thunder are frequently heard. festival of All Souls. It may be added that the ancients regarded Strongyle \u2014 as they termed Stromboli \u2014 as the seat of jEolus, God of the Winds, since, according to Pliny, the weather could be foretold three days in advance from the smoke of the volcano. It is still often affirmed that both Stromboli and Vulcano smoke most vigorously during the Sirocco wind, but the islanders affirm that the smoke is most copious during the west wind, or \" Ponente.\" Regarding the source of these gases, there is still room for some speculation. Siemens believed that the free hydrogen which is dis charged by many volcanoes \u2014 and which when lighted is the origin of the true flames which it is now known really do exist in eruptions, in addition to the reflections sometimes mis taken for them (p. 139) \u2014 is plentifully dis solved in the \" magma\" (p. 85), from which the ejecta are supposed to come. Again, we know that lava and other volcanic rocks contain various compounds which, if decomposed under the action of intense heat, would evolve several of the gases mentioned; while car bonic acid (carbon dioxide) and sulphuretted hydrogen might, like the volatile hydro-car bons of gas springs in the petroleum and coal districts (p. 141), be due to the slow distil lation of organic substances, and be connected with volcanic outbursts only in so far that the eruption has broken up the reservoir in which they have accumulated, and allowed of their free discharge into the upper world. It also follows that the different gases which we have described, by entering into combination w-ith each other, and with other substances ready to unite, will form a long series of fresh chemical compounds, such as the many beautiful minerals found in the vicinity of every volcano, and the collection of which \u2014 as visitors are not long in learning \u2014 constitutes one of the chief industries of the people in the vicinity. The rumbling and shrieking sounds Scori\u00e6, Ashes, etc. \u2014 These form the vast portion of the ejecta of many volcanoes, and may consist of all or of any of the rocks through which the volcanic force has burst, or others which it has ground into fragments, burnt into ashes, or fused into the slag-like cinders found in the vicinity of almost every cone. Others are fragmental portions of the lava detached from the main mass, in a semi-glutinous condition, like the pieces described as falling during the Santorin eruption, or merely red-hot stones of all sorts blown out by the force of the explosions of steam and gas. During the eruption of' Vesuvius, in December, 1631, heavy stones: were thrown to a distance of fourteen or fifteen miles, one which fell at the village of Somma weighing 25 tons. Sometimes these masses of rock take the form of what Darwin called \" volcanic bombs.\" t These are fre quently lumps of the rock underlying the cone, coated thickly over with lava, or are masses of lava spongy in the interior, and. more or less smooth on the outside, their shape being due to the rotatory motion they take in rising to the surface (Fig. 78).

If a stiff breeze happens to be blow ing at the period of an eruption, it may happen that one side of a motmtain will be less thickly covered than another more pro tected ; and even in a comparative calm, the dense shower of ashes being shot up high into the air, often meets with a current which carries it far from the scene of volcanic disturbance. For example, in 1845 the dust from Hekla was, ten hours after it was propelled out of the crater, thickly deposited on the decks of vessels sailing along the Shetland and Orkney coasts. In 1835 the ashes from Coseguina, in Nicaragua, 700 miles distant, fell in the streets of Kingston, in Jamaica; and during the same eruption, the fine dust covered the ground 30 miles south of the volcano with a layer ten feet thick, destroying the woods and dwellings over a considerable area, and enveloping in its mass thousands of animals unable to escape before a fall so sudden. The ashes discharged out of Vesu vius in a.d. 512 dropped on the housetops of Constantinople and Tripoli ; in 1815 dust from Sumbawa, estimated to amount to fully 185 mountains of the bulk of Vesuvius, fell, in common with stones, over an area of nearly one million square miles ; and ashes from Sangay7, in Ecuador, which discharges them in such quantity that it has buried the country round its base under a covering 4,000 feet thick, have been borne almost equally far. During the Icelandic eruption of 1874-75 large tracts of the adjoining country were covered with a thick blanket of ashes, and distinct traces of the shower were noticed as far away as the east coast of Sweden. During the eruption of Skaptar-Jokull, in Iceland, now more than a century ago, the fine dust ejected was in the atmosphere for months afterwards, and it fell in such quantities ove-\" Caithness-shire, more than 600 miles south of the volcano, that the crops were destroyed, and the tradition of this event still lives in the popular memory. It was also observed in Norway and Holland, so that the mere descents. It necessarily follows that the distance which these products of eruption lie from the mouth of the volcano is inversely to their size. Thus the great blocks and volcanic bombs, when they do not drop back into the crater, are usually found not far from the mouth ; the lapilli, being lighter, are carried to a greater distance ; while the dust and ashes may be borne on the wind for almost incredible distances. Tufa, a pasty rock, which often sets hard, enough to be used for building purposes, is formed by the consolidation of the ashes, Tig. 78. \u2014 VOL- CANIC BOMBS. owing to the rain derived from the fall of the condensed steam, or the water Avhich so often pours out of a volcano mingling with the volcanic dust. Occasion ally, indeed (p. 137), it will form a brown coloured substance, which, pouring down the sides of the cone, causes more mischief than all the primary7 products of the eruption put together. Ashes are sometimes the only ejecta of a volcano which is constantly in action. The island of Vulcano, in the Medi terranean, sends out stones and ashes, and sometimes ashes alone, though at one time it discharged all the usual products of a burning mountain. It seems by long friction to have so polished the funnel that there is little more to break off; and the lava having been exhausted, the explosions of steam or gas can find nothing more than the old ejecta to toss into the air once more, until in time some fresh disturbance may tap another reservoir of volcanic force. * Or \" rapilli,\" as they are locally known by the people living near Vesuvius. 10"], [162, "146 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. fact of a layer of volcanic ashes, without more incontestable signs of the presence of an eruption close by, would not justify the geologist in saying that a volcano existed in the vicinity of such a stratum, for the facts mentioned would go far to prove that the materials of this layer might have been brought from a long distance. the luminary. No doubt, any substantial proof establishing the association of this Eastern catastrophe with those beautiful crim son sunsets and dawns, and the occasional blue suns and green moons, which were visible in London from the middle of No vember, 1883, was hard to be obtained, but an ingenious collection of statements and coincidences was brought together in the endeavour to prove the case. However, as tronomers of the eminence of Professor Langley did not hesitate to regard these sunrises and sunsets, and that dim reddish halo which coincidently made its appearance about the sun all the world over, as due to the dust and water vapour blown into the atmosphere. Most of the heavier particles of the showers of ashes and other dibris ejected from Krakatau fell into the sea within a few miles. But a certain portion \u2014 the lightest\u2014 was probably carried by the explosion far above the lower reaches of the atmosphere, to descend so slowly that some of it may have been afloat for several years. According to the estimates of the Dutch Commission employed to investigate the question, the amount which had yet, at the time of their inquiry, to descend from the atmosphere into which it had been projected, was enor mous. It would form a mountain in itself* These facts relate to volcanic dust. But from other data we know that fine powder can be wafted prodigious distances. Leav ing out of account, as a little too vague for the important inferences to be derived from it, the assertion of Ehrenberg that in the brick-red dust collected from the decks of ships sailing near the Cape Verd Islands, he discovered South American diatoms, species of microscopic plants, covered with a flinty casing differently marked in different species, it is better established that sand from the Sahara has been detected in the Canary Islands, on the coast of Italy, and even as far as Lyons ; while the Caspian steppes some times contribute part of their dusty soil to the snowy tracts in Southern Russia far to the west. But the most remarkable facts regard ing the enormous distances which dust can be blown were furnished by the great eruption of Krakatau, in the straits of Sunda, on the 27th of August, ,1883 ; and as the facts are especially connected with the theme of this section, they may be given at some length. This explosion was so violent that, according to official testimony, it was heard at a distance of 1,800 miles, and the puff of its air- wave injured dwellings two hundred miles distant. But it was affirmed with some confidence that the air- wave started by this almost un precedented eruption carried into the highest regions of the atmosphere and around the world matter which, for at least two y7ears afterwards, affected the aspect of the sun in London and New York. At all events, the extraordinary sunsets which were so marked a feature of the northern hemisphere for long after the date mentioned, were attributed \u2014 with some show of probability, it may be admitted \u2014 to the intervention of this invisible veil of Javanese volcanic dust between us and Lava. \u2014 This is one of the most familiar accompaniments of volcanic discharges. It is melted rock which, on solidifying, forms a mass, varying in texture according to the materials out of which it was originally formed, the mode in which it was ejected, the amount of steam or gas passing through it, the speed with which it pours down the side of the volcano, and the slowness with which it cools. But though there are many varieties of it, lava has universally the same characteristics, and these characteristics (as we have seen) are those of the igneous rocks, of which basalt and the traps generally are the type. It also varies in the degree with which it is liquefied, some forms being denser than others, and therefore not flowing so far from the mouth of the crater * \" Comets and Meteors : the New Astronomy,\" in Tlit Century, Jan., 1887, p. 342."], [163, "LAVA, 147 over which it pours. Frequently it goes only a short way before it solidifies. But in other instances it rolls in an ever-broadening stream down the mountain side, carrying everything before it, and scorching all vegetation with which it comes in contact. But in every in stance the surface begins to solidify long before the interior of the lava river has hardened. Accordingly, as the surface cracks in cooling, the crawling stream bears along on its surface hosts of black blocks, hard or glutinous, un til, as it nears the end of its course, it seems to the bystander no longer a liquid flow, but a confused stream of debris tumbling along by their own weight. Such an appearance was presented by the lava streams during the erup tion of Etna in May, 1886. In the lava stream is also embedded a variety of foreign objects, most of which soon lose their individuality, being either burnt or fused by the intense heat of the molten rock. feet. In other cases lakes have formed in the hollows caused by these depressions in the lava field \u2014 Thingvallavatn, for example, which is a sheet of w-ater about thirty miles in circumference, and in places more than 100 fathoms deep. In some instances w7e find heaps of slag w7hich have accumulated at places in the course of a lava stream, from ten to twenty -five feet in height (Fig. 79). Indeed, so slowly do All the time the lava is running it is dis charging steam and other gases, so that Vogt has likened it to a locomotive engine, which has within itself substances both liquid and sobd. The escape of this steam and the gases already noted (p. 140) gives the lava a more or less porous character, the density7 or porosity of the mass depending on the violence with which they' escape, or the pressure under which the lava may have as sumed the solid condition. The surface is also often slaggy or \"ropy,\" when the current moves slowly, and therefore admits of the stream solidifying while the lava is being dragged along, or where little vapour of any sort finds its way through the liquid. In any case, the lava crawls slowly, a fact which is shown by the crystals formed in its mass or in the air-holes so characteristic of the resultant rock, whether of modern or of ancient date. When the lava Fig. 79. \u2014 SLAG DEPOSIT FROM A LAVA STREAM DISCHARGED BY VESUVIUS IN 1652. lavas solidify that it is not uncommon for the surface to be firm enough to bear a man, while through the cracks the melted rock can be seen still glowing red, a few inches below the spot where the observer is standing. Eleven months after an eruption of Vesuvius the rock was so hot that a stick thrust into it caught fire, and though seven y7ears after an eruption of Vesuvius, in 1785, lichens w7ere growing on the surface of the lava streams, the interior was hot and steaming;. It is even affirmed that the lava which flowed out of Etna in 1787 was steaming in 1830, and that eighty-seven years after the great eruption of Jurillo, in Mexico (p. 124), vapour could still be seen rising out of the cracks in its lava streams. This volcano rose up and was formed during a single night \u2014 the 29th of September, 1759\u2014 and there are Indians still living in Mexico who can remember old men who described the time when the spot where the mountain now rises to a height of 1,640 feet above the plain (4,315 feet above the sea level) was covered with palm-trees, sugar-canes, stream is very broad and deep, what are called \" slag fosses \" are formed. These are seen to perfection at Thingvalla, or Allmannagja, in Iceland, where considerable valleys have been formed by the subsidence of the centre of each lava stream.

Eye-witnesses relate that from the summit of the mountain of Aguasarca, whither they had fled in terror at the first premonitory7 signs of internal throes, which con sisted of earthquakes and in the atmosphere being laden with sulphuretted hydrogen, they7 beheld the earth over a space of more than half a square league \" veritably7 take fire.\" Gigantic sheets of flame shot out of the ground, and immense numbers of red-hot stones were hurled to enormous heights, to fall earthward in showers of fiery hail. \" The pliant crust of the earth rose like a convulsed sea above the ancient level of the plain, whilst above all hovered a dense cloud of cinders and scori\u00e6, brightly illuminated by the fires of the volcano struggling in its birth throes. The river San Pedro was shaken out of its bed, its waters being precipitated into the fier)7 chasm, where they became decomposed into their original chemical elements.\" The activity of the volcano continued unabated until the follow ing February (1760), so that the present cone is entirely due to the debris ejected during the five months of its activity. Just before Le- clercq and Fink ascended it, in 1883, various subterraneous rumblings had been heard, which the inhabitants fancied might presage another eruption, although the mountain had been dormant ever since its birth. Sudden subsidences are common along the floor of the crater, and in September, 1883, the mountain called El Cirate, near Quiroga, on the margin of Lake Pazcuaro, subsided nearly 150 feet. The tremblings of the earth are wont to make themselves felt, particularly on the approach of the rainy season, and columns of hot steam are at this period of the year frequently seen rising from the depths of the crater. When Humboldt visited the mountain forty-four years after its formation, the temperature of the \" hornitos \" (literally ovens), or miniature volcanic cones, emitting incessant columns of smoke, which emboss the plain and the mountain, was found to be 203\u00b0 Fahr. The maximum heat at pre sent is 152-6\u00b0. The floor of the crater is covered with an accumulation of lava blocks, and at one of the chasms at the bottom, through which steam ascends, the tempera ture was 152\u00b0.* The temperature of the interior of a lava stream has never yet been accurately ascer tained, though a copper wire of an inch in diameter melted when thrust into a Vesu vian lava stream, so that the heat must have been at least 2,204\u00b0 Fahr., this being the point at which the metal in question fuses. Again, at places where it has overflowed houses in its path, the lava has been known to fuse the sharp edges of gun-flints and de compose brass into its components, while silver was not only melted, but sublimed into small eight-sided crystals. Limestone caught in the folds of a lava stream has been so com pletely metamorphosed that no trace of the original stratum has remained, while fresh minerals, such as wollastonite, augite, and black garnets, have been formed. The slow rate of cooling of lava has been used as an argument to prove that if the centre of the earth was originally a molten mass, there is no ground for doubt that, covered as it is with a comparatively thin crust, its rate of cooling may have been so slow as to leave a large portion of it still in its pristine condition. A lava stream, after it solidifies, is usually slaggy at the top and bottom, and more or less homogeneous in the middle, though no certain rule prevails owing to the structure varying according to the circumstances which may obtain during the course and cooling of the current. Sometimes, indeed, especially if the stream has been shallow, or has met with many obstacles in its course, it is more or less cindery throughout; and when the air bubbles contained in the mass are numerous, or the occluded steam has passed out rapidly, the surface will be so porous that a piece will float in water. This volcanic froth or scum is usually of a whitish-grey colour, and, under the name of pumice-stone, i is largely used as a polishing material. Very frequently the air-bubbles in lava show an elongated * Bulletin de la Societe de Geographie de Paris (3e Trimestre, 1886) ; Scottish Geographical Magazine (March, 1887). + From the Italian pom ice, froth."], [165, "LAVA. 149 form, the axis of the cavities being in the direction taken by the stream in which they Lava, when rising to the surface, often bursts through fissures in the cone other than Fig. 80. \u2014 CRATER OF VESUVIUS IN 18J4, are contained, or they run into each other so as to form what the anatomist would call a series of \" anastomosing \" veins (Fig. 81). the crater, and sometimes even, when unable to reach the surface, solidities in the form of those lava dykes seen in almost every"], [166, "OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. 150 appearance, and either get condensed on or about the lava streams, or, entering into com bination with solids or vaporous objects in their vicinity, form some of the numerous products extractable from lava. They also ignite, and add to the weirdness of a volcanic discharge (p. 139). If a lava stream goes no farther than the vicinity of the crater (Fig. 80), or the base of the cone, it will only add to the area of the mountain, and slightly alter its contour. Vineyards and trees are still stand ing on the flanks of Vesuvius completely surrounded by the lava flood, which has not been able to reach the elevated oasis on which they stood ; and in Hawaii clumps of forest are often seen in the middle of a lava-field. What is more, there is a dense layer of ice on Etna, which, having been overflowed by a sheet of lava, is thereby protected from the heat of the sun and evaporation, and so what the lava spared remains longer than it would have done, though, had the ice been thinner or situated in a less favourable position, or uncovered by a layer of earth, it would undoubtedly have been melted, and contri buted to the flood which so often accompanies a volcanic outburst. volcano, and which are identical with those which we have examined in the crust of the old earth (p. 100). The outbursts of lava appear to be due to the explosive force of- the gas mingled among the molten rock. Some- times, as in the Sand- wich Islands, the lava will be propelled for days at a time from independent foun- Fig. 81.-VERTICAL SECTION OF LAVA STREAM. t&LnS. which tlll'OW . . T -ii 1 it five hundred, and even a thousand, feet into the air; and in the same region \u2014Mauna Loa, for example (Fig. 66)\u2014the lava pours in a great river from various vents upwards of 10,000 feet below the top of that mountain, and 20 miles distant. Where the stream flows out of the crater \u2014which it usually does in the smaller cones \u2014it will sometimes by its force break down the sides of the basin (Fig. 64). When the stream first pours over the edge it is wdiite-hot; then, as it cools, a red hue appears; and finally, throughout the greater portion of its course, it is of a dull black, as it creeps along at a rate depending, first, on its liquidity7, secondly7, on the steepness of the slope down which it rolls, and, thirdly, on the obstacles which it may encounter. But even after the surface had got encrusted, the great lava stream from Mauna Loa, in 1852, did not cease its progress for months, while at first it coursed along at the rate of seven and seven and a half miles an hour. But if, as not unfrequently happens, the lava rolls far intp the settled lowlands, and even into the sea beyond, the consequences are more important. Dams are formed across rivers, stemming back the current and flooding the neighbouring lands, until in course of time the stream can eat its way through the oppos ing obstacle (Fig. 54) ; or by the embankment a more or less permanent lake may be formed, and the navigation of the stream across which the lava has thrown itself be interrupted by a waterfall or a cataract. It may even happen that a valley may in a few days or weeks be filled with lava, so that a physical feature which it had taken ages for a river to sculpture will be completely effaced. Haivaiian lava flows. \u2014 The size of some of these lava streams is enormous. Those which have so frequently flowed from the craters or calderas of Hawaii are shown in the map on p. 126. Lava is the chief eject of these island volcanoes, and is so thin \u2014 almost The size of these lava streams will, of course, vary according to the size of the volcano, or the amount of lava which it may7 discharge. Sometimes, the stream will solidify on the steep side of the cone, or even harden in the shape of a cascade, as it precipitates itself over a precipice, all the time expelling not only7 steam from its \" fumaroles,\" as the points where the discharge is most marked are called, but other substances, such as sodium chloride (common salt) and iron, the one forming crystals and encrustations on the surface, and the other the y7ellow coating noticed round the edge of these vent-holes. In addition, various other gases make their"], [167, "LAVA FLOWS. 151 like molten glass \u2014 that when the wind catches it up, it is drawn into slender filaments, which go by the name of '^Pele's Hair,\" Pele having been, in the old Hawaiian my thology, the goddess who presided over the action of these fire fountains, and had her seat? in the crater. Some of these are of prodigious extent ; for instance, that of 1852, which pro ceeded from an eruption of Mauna Loa, formed an unbroken fountain of lava 200 to 700 feet high and 1,000 feet broad, though it did not burst out of the crater, but from the base of the cone. The crater of Kilauea is situated on the flank of Mauna Loa, at a height of 4,200 feet, while that of Mokuaweoweo lies in a deep pit in the actual summit, 9,500 feet higher. Kilauea is always moderately active, but keeps so circumspectly within the limits of its own huge caldera (p. 125) that it rarely does any damage, and is one of the show-places of the island of Hawaii (Fig. 82). But Mokuaweoweo is a crater of a very different character. When the internal furnace is so thoroughly heated as to force a torrent of lava to that height, the molten current begins to overflow the walls of the basin, burns its way through the forests, and perhaps overwhelms cultivated sugar-fields and villages on the mountain slopes, or even in the valleys adjoining the sea. Then comes .a time of awful anxiety as to the probable force of the flood as it sweeps onward by devious paths, pouring in cascades of fiery red fluid rock, and travelling from thirty to sixty miles ere it ends its course in the sea, raising a wild commotion among the great waves, which break unceasingly on these lava-bound shores, the clouds of spray which scud from their crests being tossed skyward by the huge vol umes of steam which rise from the boiling waters. short intervals. Of the foremost company some were burnt to death by sand and cinders, thrown to an immense height, and overwhelm ing them. The third body escaped almost uninjured, but on coming up with the centre party they found only corpses of men, women, and children. Contrary to the rule, the erup tion seems to have consisted solely7 of sand and scori\u00e6, with volumes of steam and sulphurous vapour.* In 1823 the lava stream was thirty miles long. In 1840 the bed of the crater of Kilauea sank about 300 feet, and her fires vanished underground \"with roaring and much commotion, till they broke open a passage in the district of Puna, whence they rolled on ward, burning forests, villages, and plantations \u2014 a terrific flood, from one to three miles wide and from 12 to 200 feet in depth, varying with the extreme irregularity of the ground, and having travelled a distance of 30 miles in four days, it entered the sea 17 J miles from Hilo, leaping a basaltic precipice about 50 feet in height, and forming a magnificent fire cataract a mile in width.\" All the time the surface was so clouded in steam and smoke that those standing on one side of the lava river could not see to the other shore. Some times this \" Mississippi of molten material \" widened like a great lake, then narrowed as it \" rushed through deep valleys, finally leaping into the sea in a cataract like Niagara, in a raging blood-red torrent.\" For three weeks, we are told, the flow continued. The sea boiled and raged madly as the torrent mingled with its waters. For twenty miles along the coast the waves were warm, and myriads of dead fishes floated on tbe waves. So intense was the glare that at places forty miles distant a \" fine print could be read all night by its lurid glow, and ships a hundred miles at sea beheld the strange light.\" The first eruption of which we have a distinct record occurred in 1789. It was accompanied by fearful earthquakes, dense darkness, and terrific thunder and lightning. An island war was raging at the time, and a body of men marching from Hilo to Kau were encamped by the volcano when the outburst began. Terri fied, they halted for two days, and on the third divided into three companies and started at In 1843 Mauna Loa broke out near the * Miss Gordon-Cumming : \" Fire Fountains,\" 2 vols.

Dr. Coan describes the evening when the stream began to run as clear and quiet. \" But as the sun disappeared a strange light was noticed upon the summit of Mauna Loa. A clear, white flame, whiter than the moon, deeper and stronger than any star, rested upon that distant crest, and grew momentarily more vivid as we gazed upon it. The mountain was really aflame ; no fitful jets of fire or whiff's of heated stones, as in other volcanoes, but a steady column of white-hot lava, playing noise lessly in the still night, yet emitting a light so powerful that we could read by the fiery splen dour that caststrong shadows against the moon light.\" Again, in 1855, not to mention others of less note, though of sufficient grandeur to dwarf anything of the kind in Europe, there occurred the most awful eruption on record. It began near the summit of Mauna Loa, and flowed from nearly 14,000 feet in lineal height down the slopes of the mountain in a stream of such volume that the town and harbour of Hilo were threatened. In places it was three miles wide, and where more level ground was reached the flood widened into a lake of from five to eight miles in diameter. Then parting, it divided into a network df rivers, which burnt their way through the forest and leapt precipices in a succession of cataracts and rapids. The rivers became so impregnated with pyro-ligneous acid, draining from the vast tracts of burnt forest, that many of the streams, and even the Wailuku River, assumed a hue as black as that of ink, and so offensive a taste and smell that for a time the water could not be used for domestic purposes. For six months the lava flow continued, and at one time, when it approached within six miles of the town, it seemed that nothing could save the place from being overwhelmed. But though the eruption continued for twelve months more, the lava stream was diverted and the town saved. The course of this river was sixty miles in length, and covered nearly 300 square miles of land with millions of tons of lava. At one point the velocity of the cur rent was estimated at forty miles an hour, and so pasty was the lava that it flowed continuously at angles varying from one to ninety degrees, and in places clung to the inward curves of rock, until it formed a thin glaze over the sur face. In 1859 another eruption sent, in eight days, a lava river sixty miles long into the sea at Wainanali, leaping in its way precipices thirty feet in height, and shooting up jets and columns of ignited gas and fiery matter to the height of 30, 50, and 60 feet. Smaller eruptions occurred at intervals in the suc ceeding y7ears, Kilauea being generally in sym pathetic action with the summit crater, though it is extremely rare that the boiling lava sea in that lake-like crater ever overflows its ex tensive bounds, though jets of steam and spouting lava through fissures forty miles distant show in what direction the seemingly dormant volcano is working. Towards the end of March, 1868, over a thousand shocks of earthquake were felt in five day7s, and on the 2nd of April the entire country was convulsed by one the like of which has not since been known. On the day men tioned a torrent of mud, half a mile wide and about twenty feet deep, burst from the mountain side and rushed down Avith such velocity that in a few minutes it had overwhelmed ten houses, buried thirty-one men, women, and children, and many hundred head of cattle and flocks of goats, not one of which has ever been disinterred. Most probably the mud stream was, like some of those described in previous pages, due to the volcanic disturbances having broken open some interior reservoir of water and, giving access to the lava stream, gene rated so much steam as to blow open the side of the mountain from which the muddy river obtained exit. The lava stream seems, at all events, to have flowed under the soil, for it burst forth at intervals in the shape of spouts through fissures. One of these fissures, thirteen miles in length, continues steaming to this day. Finally, after \u2022 four days, it burst forth at a height of 3,800 feet above the sea, pouring forth four streams through a fissure nearly a"], [169, "LAVA FLOWS. 153 mile long.

As usual, it was preceded by a sharp jet of lava shooting up to an immense height from the Mokua weoweo caldera, at the summit of the moun tain, though the actual flow did not begin till the 18th, more than half-way down the south-western flank of the cone. It was ex tremely copious, rising in several large foun tains, from 100 to 200 feet high, and reached the sea in 26 hours in a current averaging about three-fourths of a mile in breadth, leaving behind it a hideous embankment of clinkers, through the fissures in which, for several days subsequently, the fiery interior was disclosed. No cinder cones (Fig. 79) have been formed by contact with the sea on this occasion, but Mr. Bishop, who visited the spot a fortnight after the flow had ceased, notes that six or seven- cones stood in the vicinity, one having risen out of the sea at the flow of 1868, and been immediately united by lava to the land. This new flow consists almost exclusively of the coarse lava known in Hawaii as a-a ; the neighbouring flow of 1868, equally sudden and captious,, being palioehoe, or the smooth variety, t The new flow seems also to abound in the mineral called olivine. Experienced observers at Hilo, however, are of opinion that this is only a temporary intermission, and that activity will speedily be resumed, with probably a \" pahoehoe \" flow, such having been the general history of great eruptions, like those of 1881 and 1855. On the 14th of February, 1877, there was an eruption of six hours, after which the lava stream flowed underground until it appeared at a distance of fifty miles, where it caused a sub marine eruption in Kealakeakua Bay, famous as the spot where Captain Cook was killed. In November, 1880, the fire fountains again played, some forming three cones, one of them 400 feet in height, and sending a lava stream downwards until, in the plateau between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, it formed a lake of tossing and raging fire, several miles in diameter, and varying in depth from 10 to 300 feet. From this reservoir three streams started in different directions towards the sea. These re-divided in the course of their flow, making, however, directly for Hilo. Many of the inhabitants removed everything, and waited with anxiety for the end. But though all danger was not over for more than nine months-, the oft threatened town again escaped the fate which seemed at one time inevitable.* In the early part of the year 1886 the fires of Kilauea suddenly subsided ; the great caldera, for the first time in the brief history of the Sandwich Islands, showed no sign of activity. People descended into the bed and peeped down the chimnej7s through which the lava used to well into the forsaken \" lake of fire,\" and when a new volcanic island rose in the Pacific not far from Tonga, and the dormant volcanoes of New Zealand broke out afresh, there were not lacking theorists to affirm that at last the volcanoes of the Hawaiian group had become extinct, or at least had begun to take a long holiday in favour of their less active brethren farther south (Fig. 76). Mr. Bishop notes that the course of the lava stream could be easily traced by a heavy, How idle were such surmises was proved by symptoms of activity again displaying them selves in Kilauea, and on the 16th of January, 1887, after violent earthquake shocks, which continued for several days almost without in terruption, Mauna Loa, which had been silent since the great outburst of 1881, just described, broke forth in a lava stream, which coursed f In the Sandwich Islands the different lavas are known under the native names of (l),a-\u00ab, spongy , coarse, and hard, which on account of its extreme roughness is avoided by pedestrians ; in the holes of this lava the Hawaiians plant banana shoots or sweet potato cuttings, and in spite of the \" soil \" being simply stones or fern leaves the plants flourish ; (2), pahoehoe, or velvety lava, is the form taken when the stream has passed over a gentle slope. The clinkers, or scoriaceous lava, are found where the stream has passed through woods, or met with other obstacles which have impeded its progress. * \" Fire Fountains,\" Vol. I., pp. 125-209, and Vol. II., pp. 235-78."], [171, "LAVA STREAMS, 155 stationary line of dark cloud hanging pre cisely over it. Although a little puffing of steam was rising out of tbe sea, nothing but dry heat ascended from any point inland, save two small columns of sulphurous smoke four miles up. In walking along the lava flow, currents of highly-heated air had to be avoided, but no steam was observed, nor smoke, nor fumes of any sort which could be detected by7 the senses. Yet a dense, massive, condensation of vapour was constantly going on directly7 overhead, which vapour was most probably due to the inflowing currents of air charged with their ordinary amount of moisture. \" They were drawn in and driven up from the immense heated surface, and on reaching the necessary height, precipitated their contents into the dark cloud-bank just as naturally as the sea breeze piles its clouds daily against the mountain flank all along that coast.\" This shows that the presence of clouds above a lava stream is no proof of steam rising from it. It may be added that the latest eruption of Mauna Loa was first announced to the Honolulu people by the pervading smoke continuing from the 20th to the 30th oi January. This smoke is evidently first dis charged into the upper current of the air, and transported far to the east-north-east before settling down into the trade-wind, which brings it back to the island of Oahu, on which the capital of the group is built, t CHAPTER VIIL Volcanoes : Amount of Ejecta ; Volcanic Islands ; the Unstable Earth.

It will be seen from the foregoing facts that the amount of lava which volcanoes like those of the Sandwich Islands \u2014 immense in bulk, vio lent in action, and copious in the discharge of what is almost their only product of eruption \u2014 emit must be prodigious. Mauna Loa, it is no exaggeration to say, is \"the king of vol canoes,\" for no other in the world approaches it either in bulk or in activity. As Captain Dutton very justly claims for the mountain, the scientific history of which he has done so much to elucidate, it is, if not so lofty as some of its kindred, actually more striking ; for while they usually stand on elevated plat forms, where they appear as cones of greater or less size, Mauna Loa is so near the sea level* as to gain little by any7 adventitious circumstances of the kind mentioned. Etna, with all its adjuncts, is inferior ; while Shasta, Hood, and Rainier (Tacoma), in North-West America, if they7 were melted down and run together, would fall much below the volume of the island volcano. The magnitude of Mauna Loa is due chiefly to the great area of its elliptical base, which has a major diameter of 75 miles, and a minor of 53, measured at sea leveL Amount of Ejecta. In its aggregate eruptions, Mauna Loa is also unequalled. No doubt some of the Ice land volcanoes have been known to disgorge of the Pacific, for there is evidence to show that its plat form, since it first rose out of the sea, has been \" hoisted \" to a considerable extent during the progress of its eruptions. f Bishop : Science, Vol. IX., No. 213.pp. 205-207 ; Hitch cock : Ibid., No. 212, pp. 180-85 ; St. James's Gazette, Feb. 22nd, 1887. * In reality, it is probably far below it, though, on the other hand, it may not be so low as the adjoining depths"], [172, "156 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. at a single outburst an amount of lava fully equal to them. For instance, in 1783 Skaptar-Jokull ejected successive lava streams of such magnitude that they filled up valleys and river gorges 600 feet deep and 200 feet broad, and covered with sheets of molten rock 100 feet thick, plains 12 to 15 miles wide. Two of the lava streams nearly7 equalled the greatest of those from Mauna Loa, for they were respectively 50 and 40 miles long and 100 feet deep. It has, indeed, been estimated that the total lava vomited forth during that eruption alone would exceed, if piled up in a solid mass, the bulk of Mont Blanc, while the flow covered altogether an area of 420 square miles. This eruption was the cause by which, directly and indirectly, 20 villages, one-sixth (over 9,000 people) of the inhabi tants of the island and one-half of the live stock were destroyed. The Icelandic vol canoes, however, are more noted in recent times for the ashes and sand they disgorge than for^heir lava flows. Hekla (Fig. 83), which, like most volcanoes (p. 120), varies in height after each eruption* gives forth so much ash that the earliest historical eruption, that of 1104, is celebrated as the \" sand-rain winter;\" the second, in 1158, as \"the great darkness,\" from the air being obscured by the dust floating about in it. In 1766 a column of ashes was seen to rise out of Hekla to the height of 16,000 feet ; and though the other volcanic vents are better known for their emissions of lava, they have also always been as locally noted for the ashes discharged, as those of the Sandwich Islands are for the lava which forms almost their only contribution to the upper world. But while in Iceland lava eruptions are unfrequent \u2014 more than a century having elapsed since any of much importance has occurred \u2014 those of Mauna Loa are all of great magnitude, and occur irregularly, with an average interval of about eight years. Taking the total quantity of material disgorged during the past century- no other volcano is comparable to it. Captain Dutton considers that a moderate eruption of Mauna Loa represents more material than Vesuvius has emitted since the days of Pompeii, and that the great flow of 1855 would have nearly built Vesuvius, while those of 1859 and 1881 were not greatly inferior. Yet both Mauna Loa and Kilauea are in many important respects abnormal. Their eruptions are singularly quiet. In only one or two instances within the historic period have they been heralded by7 any such portents as earthquakes _ or subterranean rumblings ; and the vast jets of steam blown miles high, hurling stones, cinders, and lapilli far and wide, filling the heavens with vapour and smoke, and hailing down fragments and ashes over the surrounding region, have never been observed here, or only in a very feeble way. People stand to windward of the welling lava, without feeling inconvenience save that their faces tingle with the heat. Ordinarily the outbreak takes place without warning, the first intimation the islanders have of the eruption being the sky aglow and the fire fountains playing in the darkness. As the news spreads, hundreds of people flock to witness the sublime spectacle, and display about as much eagerness to approach near the scene of action as the inhabitants of other countries show to get away from so dan gerous a neighbourhood. Hence, the debris which serves to build up the acute cones of most other volcanoes being absent, the Ha waiian mountains are without any summit cone, their tops being, as we have seen (p. 126), mainly \"broad flat tables with immense pits sunk in them.\" -j- Etna, how ever, has a tolerably vehement discharge of lava. In 1865, it has been computed by Von Waltershausen, J that over 92,000,000 cubic yards of lava flowed out of Etna ; and in 1852 the amount was fully four and a half times as much. In 1669 the most terrible flow on re cord occurred, in which, not including the mischief caused by the showers of ashes and * Before that of 1845 it was usually put down at 4.(151 feet, but in 1850 Kjerulf found it to be only 4,532 feet, though probably the difference may to some extent be due to errors on the part of the surveyors. t Dutton : Report of tr.S.

It fell on the country around to the depth of 50 feet, and buried under its load 40 villages and about 3,000 human beings. After the eruption the volcano was found to have shortened itself by 4,000 feet, and to have formed a vast crater, or more probably a caldera lake, whence the ejecta had been disgorged. In the island of Timor, a volcano, visible at a distance of 300 miles at sea, is said to have entirely disappeared. Galung-gung, on the 8th October, 1822, suddenly burst into eruption, and in a few moments the landscape, which had previously been suffused with the bright ness of a tropical sun, was shrouded in the darkness of night. Over a radius of nearly 20 miles everything was destroyed by the deluge of hot water and mud (p. 38) which poured down the mountain sides. Four days afterwards a second eruption, accompanied by an earthquake, broke down the summit of the mountain, and converted one side covered with forest into a semi-circular gulf. New hills and valleys are said to have been formed, and rivers had their courses changed. Up wards of 4,000 people were killed and 114 villages destroyed, though no previous erup tion of the mountain was on record. In 1843 Guntur, in the same island, flung out ashes and sand estimated to weigh 20,000,000 tons. During the still more tremendous eruption of Tomboro, in the island of Sumbawa, the sound of the explosion was heard as far away as Sumatra, 970 miles distant ; and in the Gresca district, 300 miles away, the fall of ashes caused utter darkness. A resident in the district entered in his diary on the 12th of April, 1815, these words : \u2014 \" 11 a.m. \u2014 Breakfasted by candle-light ; the birds began to chirrup as at the approach of day.\" Out of 12,000 people in the vicinity of the volcano only 100 escaped, while the survivors regarded the catastrophe as indicative of some great event pending or happening. \" It heralded the re-establishment of the former govern ment \" (the Dutch), or \" it was a retribution for the murder of a Rajah by his brother;\" stones, which covered the country for a dis tance of sixty miles from the mountain, the lava destroyed Belpasso, Mascalucia, San Pietro, Camporotondo, Misterbianco, and fourteen villages. The quantity of lava was reckoned at more than ten times the amount in 1865 ; while even that prodigious flow is believed to have been exceeded by the torrent of which the evidences exist near Randazzo. The history of this flow, however, is unknown to us. That of 1669 is better recorded, for, apart from the damage done to the towns and villages mentioned, it undermined a hill at Albanello, two miles from Catania, and carried it and its corn-fields and vineyards forwards for a considerable distance. A vineyard, it is said by Alfonso Borelli, professor of mathe matics in Catania, who, as an eye-witness, has left us so full an account of this great catastrophe, was seen floating on the surface of the burning river. Under the walls of Catania the lava current stayed its progress until it accumulated level with the summit \u2014 60 feet \u2014 and then, pouring over in a fiery cataract, overwhelmed several of the streets, and flowed on to the sea, which it entered in a stream 1,800 feet broad and 40 feet deep. The length of the river, which approaches in mag nitude closely to those of Hawaii, is given at 15 miles, with an average breadth of between 2 and 3 miles, so that it covered 40 square miles of surface. For the first twenty days of its flow it progressed at the rate of 13 miles a day7. But as the lava began to solidify, its current was so much slower that during the last three weeks of its course it did not move at one-sixth of that speed. The thin flowing lava which, in 1794, destroyed Torre del Greco extended for up wards of 16\u00a3 English miles, and was nearly 4 broad at the place where it fell into the sea. The eruption from Val de Bove, in 1852-53, lasted more than nine months, and produced a lava stream less than two English miles in breadth, and 6y miles long. In September, 1852, this sea of fire had filled an entire valley, though the eruption did not abate until May of the following year. During the terrible eruption of 1772, in Java, Papan-"], [175, "VOLCANIC DISCHARGES. 159 while others accounted for it by a reference to their legendary tales, saying that \" Nyai Loroh Kidal had been marrying one of her children,\" the ashes being the dregs of the ammunition she had used in firing salutes from her subter ranean artillery. of lava poured down the mountain sides into the valleys, sweeping everything before them. About two o'clock on Monday morning \u2014 we are drawing on the account of an eye-witness \u2014 the great cloud suddenly broke into small sections and vanished. When light came it was seen that an enormous tract of land, extending from Point Capucin, on the south, to Negery Passoerang, on the north and west, to the lowest point, covering about fifty square miles, had been temporarily submerged by the \" tidal wave.\" Here were situated the vil lages of Negery and Negery Babawang. Few of the inhabitants of these places escaped death. This section of the island was less densely populated than the other portions, and the loss of life was comparatively small, although it must have aggregated several thousands. The waters of Welcome Bay in the Sunda Strait, and Pepper Bay on the east, and the Indian Ocean on the south, had rushed in and formed a sea of turbulent Wave. On Monday night the volcano of Papandayang (p. 158) was in an active state of paroxysmal eruption, accompanied by detonations which are said to have been heard for many miles away. In Sumatra three distinct columns of flame were seen to rise from a mountain to a vast height, and its whole surface was soon covered with fiery7 lava streams, which spread to great distances on all sides. Stones fell for miles around, and black fragmentary matter carried into the air caused total darkness. A whirlwind accompanied the eruption, by which house roofs, trees, men, and horses were swept into the air. The quantity of ashes ejected was such as to cover the ground and the roofs of the houses at Denamo to the depth of several inches. Suddenly the scene changed. At first it was reported that Papandayang had been split into seven distinct peaks. This proved untrue : but in the open seams formed could be seen great balls of molten matter. From the fissures poured forth clouds of steam and black lava, which, flowing in steady streams, ran slowly down the mountain sides, forming beds 200 or 300 feet in extent. At the entrance to Batavia was a large group of Krakatau. \u2014 But of all the volcanic dis turbances of modern times, that of Kra katau, or Krakatoa, in the Strait of Sunda, between Sumatra and Java, was the most widespread. We have already more than once referred to it, since it forms a ty7pical example of almost every catastrophe which can follow the earthquake and the volcano. Its greatest activity began on the 27th of August, 1883, and apart from the destruc tion caused by the ashes and stones \u2014 some of which fell 250 miles east of their source \u2014 a great tidal wave, rushing in on the west and north-west coast of Java, choked up rivers, overflowed land, and swept away many vil lages and even considerable towns, besides lighthouses and other public works. The dis turbances originated on the island of Krakatau with eruptions of red-hot stones and ashes, and by noon next day Semeru, the largest of the Javanese volcanoes, was reported to be belching forth flames at an alarming rate. The eruption soon spread to Gunung Guntur and other mountains, until more than a third of the forty-five craters of Java were either in activity or seriously threatening it. Just before dusk a great cloud hung over Gunung Guntur, and the crater of the vol cano began to emit enormous streams of white sulphurous mud and lava, which were rapidly succeeded by explosions, followed by tremen dous showers of cinders and enormous frag ments of rock, which were hurled high into the air and scattered in all directions, carrying death and destruction with them. The over hanging clouds were, moreover, so charged with electricity (p. 144) that water-spouts added to the horror of the scene. The eruption con tinued for all the Saturday night, and next day a dense cloud shot with lurid red gathered over the Kendang range, intimating that an eruption had broken out there. This proved to be the case, for soon after streams"], [176, "160 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. was completely inundated and the floating dock totally destroyed. Baby and Cheribon islands lost a few houses and inhabitants upon them. In Batavia the roof of the governor's house was crushed in by a mass of mud, and three servants were killed. Midah Island, ten miles off, on the coast of Java, was almost wholly engulfed.\" The towns of Anjer, Tjirin giri, and Telokbetong, were either partly or wholly destroyed. Merak, three miles from Krakatau, was effaced ; and many of the lighthouses along the Sunda Strait either disappeared or were rendered useless. The aspect of the Strait was much changed, and the navigation for a time dangerous. Some 900 in habitants of the town of Waronge were known to have been killed, and at Talatoa, on the coast, 300 bodies were found. From all over the island came reports of loss of life and pro perty, and it was at one time thought that the estimate of 75,000 would not prove excessive. On the lowlands of Batavia, when the waters receded, hundreds of bruised and mangled bodies lay exposed. The graphic account from which these notes are condensed was transmitted immediately after the catastrophe, and though checked by more recent reports, may, perhaps, have been exaggerated in some particulars, especially as regards the loss of life. But in its essential details it is suffi ciently accurate to be of scientific value, while it notices almost every phenomenon attending a volcanic outburst and a great earthquake shock. houses extending along the shore, and occu pied by Chinamen. This portion of the city was entirely destroyed, and not many of the Chinese who lived on the swampy plains managed to save their lives. They stuck to their homes till the waves came and washed them away, fearing torrents of flame and lava more than torrents of water. Of the 3,500 Europeans and Americans in Batavia \u2014 which for several hours was in darkness owing to the fall of ashes^800 perished at Anjer. The European and American quarter was first overwhelmed by rocks, mud, and lava from the crater, and then the waters came up and swallowed the ruins, leaving nothing to mark the site, and causing the loss of about 200 lives of the inhabitants and those who sought refuge there. \" Bantam was entirely covered by water, and 1,200 to 1,500 are believed to have been drowned. The island of Serang was completely inundated, and not a soul survived. At Cheribon there was no great flood of water, but the loss of life and pro perty by falling rocks and lava must have been considerable. Buitenzorg suffered se riously, as did Samarang, Djokjo-Karta, Soura karta, and Sourabaya. The numerous temples at Brambanan were greatly damaged, and some of them destroyed. The dome of the noted temple of Borobodo was crushed in by falling rocks. The town of Tamerang was swept away by the flood, and fully half the popula tion, mostly Javanese, numbering about 1,800, perished. At Speezwydt red-hot stones set fire to the housss and swept away all the thickly settled portions of the town. About ten bazaars belonging to Europeans were de stroyed. The river Jacatra, on the banks of which Batavia is situated, was so com pletely dammed by lava and debris, that its course was changed, and from Franien Bastion it flowed down through Tjgers Street and joined the waters of the river Emerades, swelling that stream to such an extent that it rose high on the Castor batteries. Fige leking was almost totally destroyed, and a large number of lives lost. The island of Onius, five miles off, at the mouth of the Tan gerang river, and twenty miles east of Batavia, It will be seen that the eruptions began in the island of Krakatau, in the Sunda Strait, on which is a volcano which has been fre quently7 active, and several weeks before the great outburst exhibited symptoms of un easiness. At first it was reported that Krakatau had entirely vanished. But a considerable portion of it still remains, though, in places where land formerly existed, soundings of 160 fathoms have been taken without bottom being reached. A large portion of the erupted matter seems to have been deposited a few miles to the north of Krakatau, where, in addition to smaller land specks, two new islands, Steers and Calmeyer,"], [177, "161 EFFECTS OF A VOLCANIC ERUPTION. made their appearance, and formed the shoals to the north of Lang Island, which seems to have been about on the line between the upheaval and downfall, and has not materially changed in size. All of the islands were covered with ashes, as were the trees and hills in the vicinity of St. Nicholas way Island, clearing away the vegetation, and leaving the lowland bare, gave these breaks in the forest the appearance from a distance of five islands.

The plains were swept by the sea, and showed, after the hurly-burly was over, only uprooted palms and ghastly7 relics of the inhabitants.

A cone may take ages to grow, or it may appear like Monte Nuovo \u2014 a volcanic hill near Naples, 456 feet high \u2014 which was upheaved on the 30th of Sep tember, 1538. In 1872, when Vesuvius was in violent eruption, it discharged rocks nearly four miles into the air, and such an amount of lava poured through the great fissures on every side, that Palmieri describes the moun tain as \" sweating fire.\" The distance to which the ashes were car ried has already been noticed (p. 145). They showed much the same composition as those from the volcanoes of the Cascade Range in North- West America.* The pumice-stone reached the harbour of St. Paul on the 22nd of March, 1884, after having made a voyage of some two hundred and six days at a rate of six-tenths of a mile an hour. Immense quantities of pumice of a similar description, and believed to have been derived from the same source, reached Tamatave in Madagascar five months later, and no doubt much of it is still floating round the world. Another result of the eruption was the series of atmospheric waves, caused by the disturbance in the atmosphere, which affected the baro meter over the entire world. The velocity with which these waves travelled has been variously estimated at from 912'09 feet to 106629 feet per second.f This speed is of course very much inferior to that at which sound travels through the air. Yet, in three distinct cases, the noise of the Krakatau explosions was plainly heard at a distance of at least 2,200 miles, and in one instance \u2014 that recorded from Rodriguez \u2014 of nearly 3,000.

The Royal Society is preparing an ex haustive report on the subject, which will, no doubt, contain a carefully-sifted digest of all that is known regarding the eruptions, the earthquakes, and the tidal waves. * Iddings : \" Notes on the Volcanoes of Northern California, Oregon, and Washington Territory.\" (Ameri can Journal of Science, September, 1883.) || Le Conte : American Journal of Science, 3rd ser., Vol. VII.

These vast sheets cover the country like a flood, here and there taking the columnar form, like the older basalts (Fig. 86), albeit the origin of these lava beds is, geologically, compara tively recent.* Viewed a few miles from its edge this huge mass seems to stretch inimit ably. Yet no volcanic cone can be detected, and there is no reason for believing that, as in Auvergne, the action of the wind and the weather has effaced the volcano which disgorged this flood of molten rock. But from what we have seen of the Hawaiian and other volcanic vents, there need be little hesitation in accepting the suggestion (made first in print by Von Richthofen in 1868, though this idea had presented itself to more than one traveller over this tract long before the famous German geologist visited it) that a cone and a crater were not necessary, the lava having simply been spewed out through great fissures in the ground (Fig. 85). This explana tion may also apply to other basaltic plateaux and sheets, such as those in the West of Scot land, in Antrim in Ireland, in Abyssinia, Western India, and Victoria, in the vicinity of none of which has any cone or crater been discovered. (Fig. 86). there is no reason why there should not be volcanic eruptions under the sea, or indeed under any water. Indeed, in some respects there is Some ground for believing that they should be more active in such localities ; for if the water infiltrating through the cracks in the earth's crust, and coming in contact with the molten matter or internal fires, has a leading part in causing the explosions to which eruptions are due, the leaky bottom of the ocean and other places constantly covered by water may logically be regarded as more than usually liable to the disturbing agent mentioned. It may, therefore, be taken for granted \u2014 though in science the less we have to do with assumptions the better \u2014 that under the ocean the volcano discharges its debris quite as much and quite as frequently as on the land. Many facts support this view. Ships navi gating the Pacific and other oceans often pass through large patches covered with pumice stone and other volcanic substances capable of floating, and vast numbers of dead fishes. Occasionally the ocean is found to be boiling as from some disturbance beneath ; and boats passing along the shore of Hawaii have more than once been struck by pieces of lava forcibly ejected from the bottom of the sea. One lava flow overlies another almost like one stratified bed over those below it, so that on making a section of any deposit, the slightest flow may be detected, each stream having usually something to distinguish it from its predecessors.

Many islands, like St. Paul, Ascen sion, Reunion, Amsterdam (Fig. 84), and Barren Island, are mere heaps of cinders and lava, and doubtless originated by the materials of which they are composed being ejected from the bottom of the ocean. Reunion evidently owes its existence to the mountains of which the Piton des Neiges and Le Volcan are the chief points rising out of the sea.

Finally, there are plenty of instances in which what has been assumed by inference to have happened has actually been seen in operation. This, however, the seafaring men declared was not the case. About 189 miles west of Punta Ahrija, in northern Peru, they affirmed that they saw with their eyes a new island, about a mile long by a mile wide, and it is almost needless to say uninhabited by human beings.

For instance, in ad dition to two large ones described very recently, a third was discovered in 1886 by Captain Allison, of the Fee- Lung, whilst on a voyage from Sydney to Shanghai. The new island is situated less than 100 miles from the north ern coast of New Guinea, between the island of Durour and the Exchequer Archipelago. It has been named after its discoverer, and is officially described as about one and a half miles long, rising from 100 to 150 feet above the the New Guinea coast, and similar discoveries are made once in a while in various parts of the Pacific. Although the maps of the Pacific Ocean are studded with islands which appear to be lying close together, vessels may sail among these islands for weeks together without once coming in sight of land. So vast is the waste of waters that not long ago a crew which had been shipwrecked in the great island region of the Pacific rowed north for forty days before they reached Hawaii, the nearest land.

In any case, the island must have been a volcanic one, the offspring of some submarine eruption so common off that earthquake-riven coast. Otherwise it is impossible to believe that it could have escaped the notice of navigators. It is also comforting that the sea which vomited it forth swallowed it up, and thus saved all further diplomatic difficulties over its pro prietorship. For no one could have any yards. Then naval officers and Foreign Minis ters began to take an absorbing interest in it.

This insignificant slag-heap, over which so much ink was spilt, and gunpowder might have been burnt, arose in 1831, some thirty miles off the south-western shores of Sicily.

In 1422 high rocks of con siderable circumference appeared. In 1783, about a month before the eruption of Skaptar Jokull, Nyoe, a volcanic island, from which fire and smoke issued, was built up, and in due time vanished under the waves, all that remains of it now-a-days being a reef from 5 to 35 fathoms below the sea level ; and in 1830, after several long-continued eruptions of the usual character, another isle arose, and, at the same time, the skerries known as the Geirfuglaska disappeared, and with them the great auks, or gare-fowls \u2014 birds now extinct \u2014 which up to that time had bred on them. At all events, though the auks could not well have been drowned, no traces of them were seen after the date mentioned.* elsewhere ; and as late as the y7ear 1811 Captain Tillard, of His Britannic Majesty's ship Sabrina, was so fortunate as to be able to observe the birth of the isle to which he gave the name of his frigate. From the nearest cliff of St. Michael's, in the Azores, the volcanic bombs and debris were seen to break through the surface of the sea with a noise resembling a mixed discharge of cannon and musketry, until it had attained the height of 300 feet and a circumference of half a mile. A proud man was Captain Tillard as he told the Navy Board of his great discovery7, though there is a tradition in Whitehall to the effect that when, a few weeks later, he returned to survey his annexation, the English language was found insufficient to express his anguish at finding that the sea had again claimed its own. Not a trace of Sabrina Isle was visible. It had sunk in the Western Ocean, whether devoured by the insatiable breakers or by the subsidence of the general mass there is no material to enable us to decide. In July, 1884, an island again appeared about ten miles off Rej'kjanes ; but it is already beginning to diminish hi size, and may soon disappears Nor does it matter, since there are plenty of other instances of the influence of the sub marine forces in raising up and lowering land. The coast of Alaska is a region of intense vol canic action. In 1795, during a period of vol canic activity in the craters of Makushina, on Unalashka, and in others on Umnak Island, a volume of smoke was seen to rise out of the sea about 42 miles to the north of Unalashka, and next year was followed by a heap of cinders, from which some debris were ejected, m company with flames, which illumined the country over a radius of ten miles. In four years the island consisted of a large cone, 3,000 feet above the sea level, and two or three miles in circumference. Two years later it was still so hot that when some hunters landed on it they found the soil too warm for walking. It was named Ionna Bogoslova (St. John the Theologian) by the Russians, Agashagok by the Aleuts, and is now known to the whites of that region as Bogosloff. Mr. Dall believes that it has occupied This is not a solitary instance of a volcano throwing up a temporary islet in the same part of the ocean, for in the MS. Journals of the Royal Society we read that Sir H. Sheres informed a meeting of \"January 7th, 1690 91,\" that \"his father passing by the Western Islands, went on shore on an island that had been newly thrown up by a volcano, but that in a month or less it dissolved, and sank into the sea, and is now no more to be found.\" Off the coast of Iceland islands appear and disappear during the many volcanic eruptions to which that remote dependency of Denmark is subject, and at various periods in its history the sea has been covered with pumice and other debris, which tell their own tale of what has been going on, without the ejecta being bulky enough to reach the surface in the form of a continuous cone.

Marine shells far above the highest tidal mark are found plentifully along the shores of South America, commencing at Tierra del Fuego, and along the west coast for a distance of at least 2,000 miles, and in patches probably as far north as the Isthmus of Panama, these evidences of upheaval being deposited at elevations vary ing, according to Darwin, from 300 to 1,300 feet over the sea level. in the water-courses have oeen traced to an identical cause. Australia, on the north-east, if not on the whole of the east coast, is rising. Mr. Rattray describes water-worn waves well above high-water mark in the sandstone cliffs of Albany Island, and in those of the mainland opposite, while the drainage of the country is altering, and the country several miles inland is covered with recent shells. Until a very late period in the geological history of Tasmania, the site of Hobart Town was covered by the sea ; and in New Zealand, though there is an area of depression on the extreme north-Avestern point, the mass of the land is risings The raised sea beaches which are taken as proofs of the rising of the land, are found not only around the places already noticed, but along the outer coast of Norway, South America \u2014 at Coquimbo, for example \u2014 and along many parts of the shores of Great Britain. At Brighton, for instance, there is a marked specimen of this in the cliff's east of Kemp Town ; while Robert Chambers wrote an elaborate work, mainly descriptive of those to be traced along the Scottish coasts at all heights up to 100 feet above the present sea level.* Again, though belonging to the same class of proofs, the elevation of the coast here is indicated by caves, formed by the constant dash of the waves, being found along the coasts of Scotland, near Campbell town and Neill, in Cantire, for example, at places far above the reach of the sea, which laves the base of the cliffs in which they are excavated. Depression. \u2014 The sudden elevations and depressions caused by earthquakes will be considered at a later stage in our studies. Yet in plenty of regions, 'where there are nc marked signs of either earthquakes or vol canoes, there is a depression as well as an elevation going on. In various parts of South Greenland, the Eskimo can no longer build their huts in the places where their fathers did before them, owing to the sinking of the coast. The floors of houses on lowish lands are now submerged at every high tide, and the old poles to which the Moravian missionaries moored their boats lay under water at the time Dr. Pingel visited the country some fifty or sixty years ago. One of the streets of the town of Malmo, in Sweden, is flooded by the sea when the wind is high ; and at eight feet below the present road the remains of a still earlier one have been found, showing that at the extremity of a region now rising there has been, for several centuries at least, a subsidence going on. A rock at Trelleborg \u2014 nine miles from Malmo \u2014 Avhich in 1749 Linn\u00e6us measured the distance of from the sea, was found, in 1836, to be 100 feet nearer the shore. Submerged forests, such as are found round the shores of Devon, Cornwall, West Somerset, off\" the north coast of Norfolk from Hunstanton to Brancaster Bay, and among other places along In Natal upheaval is still going on, and the eastern coast of Africa is generally believed to be rising ; and, just as in North- Western India, the drying up of the rivers and springs has been attributed to the level of the country having changed, so in the country beyond the Orange River, in South Africa, remarkable changes * \" Ancient Sea Margins, or Memorials of Changes in the Relative Level of Sea and Land\" (1848). Some of Dr. Chambers 's sea margins are, however, rather problem atical, though there are plenty to prove the case without taking these doubtful ones into account. In Dr. Geikie's \" Scenery and Geology of Scotland \" (1865), pp. 193, 318, etc., these features are most lucidly described. f Howorth : Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Vol. XLIV., pp. 252-262."], [184, "OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. 172 parts of the Lincolnshire coast,* may again be cited in proof of submergence ; while the buried valleys and river channels, and the fjords or lochs of the west of Scotland, Norway, Greenland, British Columbia, and other countries enjoying, as most countries do, a damp climate on their westerly side, which were originally the beds of glaciers, are also evidence of the coast having sunk, other wise water could not occupy what were formerly glens. The southern shores of the Channel are slowly sinking, as is also the coast northward from France to Jutland. Finally7, not to multiply instances of the same character, there is no doubt that if we accept the current theory of the way coral reefs are formed \u2014 of which doctrine we cannot anticipate the discussion \u2014 the submerged lands on which they are built must be regularly sinking. therefore, have been under the sea so as to permit these molluscs to bore in its pillars. But, six feet below the flaor of the temple, a second pavement exists, showing that the temple had been sinking even at the time when it w7as a shrine of Jupiter Serapis, so that it had been necessary to construct a new floor at a higher level. This might have been in the time either of Marcus Aurelius or of Septimius Severus, both of whom helped to restore the building. When the ex cavations began, the temple area was filled, to the depth of 13 feet, with stratified ma rine deposits and volcanic debris, probably from Solfatara, a neighbouring crater, which beds seem to have protected the lower part of the columns from the shell-fish which bur rowed into them above that level. It is therefore certain that at one time Pozzuoli must have been at least 20 feet lower than it is at present. After that date, probably about three and a half centuries ago, the re-elevation began, and was expedited by the great eruption of Monte Nuovo (p. 162). Finally, since last century, the ground on which the temple stands has been gradually sinking, the lower part of the ruin being now under water, though, in order to prevent unhealthy exhalations, the level of the ground has been raised by7 artificial means. These interesting remains of pagandom, therefore, demonstrate repeated depressions, periods of rest, and elevations, alternating with each other. Alternate Elevation and Depression.\u2014 It must, however, have often happened that a region which has been for a long period rising has again sunk, or vice versa. For instance, a hut has been found in Sweden beneath layers of sea - sand and gravel, though the spot on which it exists is now high above tidal mark. It is therefore clear, that as the prehistoric fisherman did not erect his house at the bottom of the sea, it must first have been on dry land, and then, after being sunk with the soil on which it stood, untfl it got silted over, it was by another change slowly raised into the upper air. But the most noted instance of this alternate elevation and depression is afforded by the Temple of Jupiter Serapis, at Pozzuoli, on the Bay of Bai\u00e6, close to Naples. Its present appearance may be understood by a reference to Fig. 88. Cause of elevation and depression. \u2014 From what has been said in the preceding sections, it will be seen that secular rising and sinking of the land, though no doubt due to internal movements affecting the earth's crust, cannot strictly be assigned to the operation of the same causes which produce volcanoes and earthquakes. In the majority of cases, the regions affected are either far away from a vol canic vent or tract, or the connection between the two is not very apparent. Moreover, while an earthquake or a volcano is essentially sud den and violent, this sinking or rising of the land \u2014 which seems to have been going on ever since the world began \u2014 is so imperceptible The great marble pillars \u2014 three only of which remain \u2014 are, up to the height of 12 feet, smooth. But above this level they are, throughout a zone nine feet high, perforated by a burrowing shell-fish (Lithodomus dactylus), the valves of which still remain at the bottom of the holes. The temple must, * Jukes-Browne, in Geological Magazine, Vol. III., p. 491, Vol. VIL, p. 164, etc."], [185, "Fig. 88.\u2014 RUINS OF THE SERAPEUM, OR TEMPLE OF JUPITER SERAPIS, AT POZZUOLI, NEAR NAPLES (After a Photograph),"], [186, "174 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. and rise in the other one from the opposite cause. Still, though the facts given are plausible enough, they seem too local to be quite applicable to every district, and, in truth, these causes for a rise or diminution in the temperature of underlying rocks and a consequent elevation and depression of the surface, do not in every case appear to be apropos to the places in which the pheno mena of secular rise or fall are notoriously present. that it is only from a consideration of the facts mentioned we are able to know that it has occurred at all, and is still in progress. It is also clear that though the circumstances attending the phenomena are much the same throughout wide areas, there are always local peculiarities which compel us to seek for an explanation of the facts in causes to a certain extent of local operation. The explanations which have been offered are, however, so varied, and frequently so in consistent with each other, that we are com pelled to come to the- conclusion that though some of the causes suggested may7 border on the truth, science has as y7et failed to solve a problem the main facts of which have never been doubted. For example, (1) This secular rise and fall of the earth's crust* have been attributed to the swelling of rocks on one hand by heating, and their contraction in another direction by cooling. That this occurs may be taken for granted. In the vicinity of a volcano, or even in a marked volcanic district, it must indeed be of frequent occurrence. Lyell has calculated that a mass of sandstone would raise the rocks above it 10 feet if its temperature was raised by 200'-' above the normal heat \u2014 the elevation being, of course, proportionately greater as the temperature is higher and the beds affected thicker. This augmentation of temperature, however, may be produced by other means than mere local heat derived from a volcano, or the concomi tants of one. A heavy pressure caused by superincumbent beds of rock or other circum stances will raise the heat of those lying below them ; for (as we have already seen) the isogeo therms (p. 83) in the earth's crust follow pretty evenly the contour of the surface, so that when by the operation of denudation, or the causes which have been continually in operation tending to wear away the rocks, a mass of material is removed from one spot and deposited in another, the isogeotherms of the first-named locality will fall, owing to the diminished tem perature of the rocks far beneath the surface, (2). Mere mechanical principles have been called in to account for one part of the earth shifting upwards while another is just as slowly shifting downwards. For instance, the accumulation of vast masses of ice around the poles during comparatively recent periods in the earth's history would tend to depress them, while the melting of these loads would allow the crust to gradually relax from the tension under which it lay. Some of the American geologists will go so far as to declare that even smaller weights than those indicated will disturb the equilibrium of the earth \u2014 that, for instance, those parts of America which have been long out of water, and there fore not subject to heavy pressure, have risen, while others which have been loaded with heavy masses of superincumbent beds, show subsidences. But this contention cannot be seriously entertained since, as Dr. Geikie points out, to believe that the removal or deposit of a few thousand feet of rock could force the crust of the globe to sink and rise in proportion, takes for granted such a mobility in the earth as could not fail to manifest itself in a far more powerful way under the influence of the attraction of the sun and moon. In brief, terrestrial tides would be the result (p. 84). No doubt, if masses of ice accumulated at either pole, the land in the hemisphere affected would sink, or, in other words, the sea level would be higher, while the contrary would be the case in an opposite direction. Moreover, in consequence of the diminution of centri fugal force, owing to the retardation of the earth's rotation caused by the tidal wave, Dr. Croll considers that the sea level must have a tendency to subside at the equator and * \u25a0\u2022 Bradysismus,\" as Arthur Issel (\" Movimonti secol. del Suolo,\" 1885) has somewhat needlessly termed it, from the Greek bradys, slow, and seismos, an earthquake."], [187, "SECULAR RISE AND FALL. 175 rise at the poles,* though in truth so slow must be any change of level from this cause that the waste of land continually going on would most probably keep pace with it, and thus \" diminish the terrestrial area as much as the retreat of the ocean tended to increase it.\" This explanation does not therefore appear much more satisfactory than the one which we have already dismissed. (5). Finally7, without explaining the ingenious views of George Darwin regarding the in fluence which its rotation and the moon's attraction might have on the earth, which are barely compatible with known facts, it may be added that most geologists are now adays inclined to look to the slow cooling and consequent contraction of the earth for an approximate explanation of not only the wrinkles on its surface but of the phenomena under discussion (p. 36). The influence of this secular cooling on the formation of mountain ranges will be discussed in the next chapter. Meantime, it is enough to say that the earth appears to be a globe which has been slowly cooling by dissipating heat into space, and that the result of this continual though slow loss of its original heat must be to contract its dimensions, since rocks, like most other in organic bodies, swell by Avarmth and shrink by cold (p. 174). Mallet, whose name is prin cipally connected with the researches on this question, has come to the conclusion that since the almost incalculably remote period when the earth was a liquid sphere, it has diminished in diameter by at least 189 miles. But though a comparatively thick crust now covers the globe (and whatever hypothesis is accepted as to the structure of the interior, this is cer tain) the interior must still be parting with heat, through the crust, just \u2014 to use an apt simile \u2014 as a lava stream which, though liquid in the interior, may be hard enough on the surface to admit of a man's weight (p. 147).- But as this contraction of the interior goes on, the outside crust will slowly settle down upon the ever-shrinking liquid interior, be this a molten zone (p. 85) or a more con tinuous central mass of liquidity. This would, of course, cause a sinking of certain portions. But as the crust which thus falls by its own w-eight differs considerably in structure and in its power of conducting heat, it neces sarily7 follows that all parts of the interior will not shrink at the same rate, and conse quently- those parts which sink will not do so simu ltaneously. However, any mechanic knows that where a more or less stiff* arched envelope like the crust of the globe presses inwardly in (3). The \" shifting of the present distribution of density within the nucleus of the planet \" would no doubt affect the position of the oceans and the level at which they would stand re latively to the land arising out of them. In deed, it has already been suggested that the irregular distribution of land and water may be accounted for by this irregular distribution of materials in the interior beyond the limits to which our investigations have as yet been, and most probably always will be, confined. The fact of the Southern hemisphere contain ing more ocean than continent, and the exist ence, more particularly, of the Pacific Ocean, has been explained by the presence of some excess of matter in the solid parts of the earth between the Pacific Ocean and the earth's centre, which retains the water in its place. Otherwise the ocean would flow away to the other parts of the earth.f (4). The idea of Suess and others that the so called rising and sinking of the land arc due, not to any actual shifting of its level, but to changes of the sea level, resulting from oscilla tions of the oceanic envelope, may7 be dismissed, since this notion is held by almost no geo grapher or geologist of any eminence, and, indeed, is made reconcilable with known facts often only by affecting to deny the reality of those which stand in the way of this theory, or ignoring others which there is no getting over.

There is probably no spot on the earth's sur face Avhich has not been at one time under the Avater, and certainly none of Avhich the level has not changed more than once.

Hoav far this has aided in the for mation of mountain ranges Avill be best con sidered after the origin of volcanic action and the internal structure of volcanoes have been examined. The arguments AA'hich have been brought against it may also be more instruc tively discussed Avhen the theory of mountain elevation is before us. Meantime, it seems that though other influences may have been at work, the doctrine thus briefly stated is more fully in keeping with knoAvn Lws and ascertained facts than any other which has been placed in rivalry Avith it. Nature seldom does her work by one agency. Many factors are at her beck. Hence, leaving out of account various others, it is quite possible that rocks A\\7hen subjected to crushing, and therefore to friction, develop heat, and that the enormous crumpling and crushing of strata, miles in thickness, during the subsidence and lateral pressure resulting from it, would by developing a high degree of temperature so expand the strata that they might, independently of the mere mechanical action described, be by this means raised while it lasted, and loAvered Avhen they cooled. All this is, no doubt, mere speculation. But where inferences must be drawn from data Avhich are bey7ond our power to check, the theories formulated from such premises must necessarily be vague. But no greater mischief can be done in science than to affect knoAvledge Avhere it does not exist, since in the eyes of the ignorant the facts Avhich are well estab lished are apt to be doubted and, from the scepticism engendered, to share the fate which, sooner or later, overtakes the children of hypothesis. But if the causes of this steady7 rise and fall, this sIoav emergence of tracts of country out of the sea, and gradual subsidence into it again, cannot be explained Avith any degree of con fidence, there is no disputing the existence of the phenomena.

But all the other materials are dependent on heat. The lava is melted trap \u2014 if the term can properly be applied to a material which probably7 has never been solid \u2014 or, at all events, when cooled, solidities into the igneous rocks Avhich Ave have learned to know under that family name (p. 92). The lavas, therefore, as they harden when exposed to cold, must have been under the influence of extreme heat in the localities whence they are ejected. The ashes, etc., are also the pro ducts of a high temperature, being earth, stones, and other terrestrial materials, Avhich, instead of melting, have burnt into dust or been broken into fragments, or which, having been in a semi-glutinous condition, have hardened soon after they reached the upper world, so that the problem of their origin is identical with that of the origin of lava. We have seen that these liquid materials are of different kinds, and that in the course of their ejection from a volcano they are very regular in their sequence \u2014 that is, first one kind comes, and then another, though it seldom happens that all the different sorts are vomited out of the same crater (Fig. 89). One or tAvo may be present, or only one. But in every case where it is possible to follow the sequence, it is affirmed that they always follow a regular order, in which propylites and andesites (varieties of the diorite group) come first, and basalt last. It is, therefore, evident that the reservoirs from Avhich these various lavas are derived must, in some Avay, When Ave come to consider what are the causes of volcanic action, we are face to face with the same difficulties presented by any attempt to explain the kindred \u2014 if not identical \u2014 secular rise and fall. We are in the presence of forces the results of which are manifest, but the actuality of Avhich is hidden from us far in the depth of the earth.

In the pre ceding chapters many of the phenomena at tending volcanic eruptions Avcre so patent that their explanation required no great acuteness on the part of the observer. But in every case where the problem was so easily solved the phenomena were external, However, when we come to examine the forces which cause an eruption of volcanic matter we are at once compelled to account for \u2014 firstly, the materials discharged, and, secondly.the force which sends them to the surface. The ejecta of a volcano, as we have seen, are Avater, steam, gases, ashes, slag, and lava. The water is, in the majority of cases, a mere accidental discharge, one which has been ejected from the crater simply because it happened to accumulate there during a period of quiescence, or is the contents of some superficial reservoir which has been tapped during a volcanic outburst. The gases may also, in some instances at least, have been derived from terrestrial cavities not directly connected with the seat of disturbance, though in other instances they seem to be derived either from the decomposition of Avater, or"], [191, "CAUSES OF VOLCANIC ACTION. 179 be occupied by molten materials divided into superincumbent layers of different specific Gravity, just as in a basin we might have oil on the top, water below, tar in a third layer, and treacle or some heavier substance at the bottom. All four Avould be liquid. The mass of which they were the components would conform itself to the shape of any cavity ; but if, by the application of any force, the cavity were emptied after the manner of the hypothetical lava reservoir under considera tion, the contents would be ejected in the air, provided they Avere in layers of sufficient depth, in the order Avhich they occupied. Yet, though the lavas may be different from each other in minor characteristics, they have so many leading characteristics in common that the conclusion is forced upon us that they all come from a common source, and are due to conditions essentially the same. What is more, the order of superposition mentioned, and the other features described, hold true not only of one country, or of one hemisphere, but of every part of the world. extensive with the globe. In many parts of the world \u2014 in the \" lava beds \" of Oregon and Idaho, for example (p. 163) \u2014 the molten matter/ seemed to have been spewed out of the earth simultaneously over several thousand square miles. In HaAvaii, outbursts of lava often occur at distances of many miles from the place Avhere it first appears, the rivers, to use the local expression, having \" run under ground\" (p. 151). But in Hawaii, also, Ave see \u2014 as in Mauna Loa and Kilauea \u2014 ejections from tAvo craters comparatively near each other, and yet at different times. What is more, though the first-named crater is at a higher level than the latter, it will often happen that Avhile the one is playdng the other is idle, or that both craters will be full of lava at the same time \u2014 an impossibility if the reservoir from Avhich both drew their supplies Avas the same. Moreover, two craters, close together, Avill often yield, though in eruption simultaneously, different kinds of lava, and it is knoAvn that the same volcano does not ahvays discharge the same liquid ejecta, one eruption being mainly of basic, while its successor will spout silicic, these two kinds forming the tAvo great divisions of lavas, corresponding, it is thought by some, to the tAvo great magmas in the hypo thetical liquid zone of the globe (p. 85). Finally, from observations made on different eruptions, it has been asserted by sound physicists that the source Avhence the lavas and other materials come cannot be situated at any great depth in the earth (Fig. 90). Here, then, are certain facts from which we are free to infer what we please. If Ave Avere at liberty to accept the old theory7 of a liquid interior covered by a comparatively thin crust, or even a liquid zone intermediate between the hard nucleus and the external rind of the globe (p. 84), our difficulties would be less. For the source of .the internal lava Avould be provided at once, and, as we shall presently see, the means whereby it is ejected less puzzling to find. But the molten centre covered Avith the thin but ever-thickening shell is a doctrine not so universally in favour as it once Avas, Avhile the newer hy pothesis of the external crust reposing on a molten zone with different \"magmas,\" and itself external to a hardened kernel, is a view still on its good behaviour. It is a \" Avorking hypothesis,\" the sole recommendation of which is that it helps us out of one set of difficulties at the cost of plunging us into a morass of others. Moreover, it is evident that though the cavities \u2014 of Avhatever description \u2014 in which this lava is contained prior to its ejection are very extensive, they are not co- if we accept either the hypothesis of a central liquid mass or a liquid zone, it is not difficult to imagine that as the liquid matter is cooling so it must contract, and conse quently the superincumbent crust contract Avith it, and thus squeeze out in the form of a volcanic discharge the lava and other ejecta of a crater. This doctrine has been ingeniously advocated by Mr. Robert Mallet, who has devoted a lifetime to a study of subterranean disturbances. He considers that this crushing must constantly be going on, and that as volcanoes are usually7 found in lines along the crest of mountain ranges, these ranges form"], [192, "180 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. Another predicament Avhich faces us is this. If cooling and contraction, folloAved by crush ing and squeezing, Avere the sole agents in causing volcanic discharges, Ave could scarcely conceive them to be so intermittent as they notoriously are. Nor need the minor, though sufficiently awkward, difficulty of explaining how, if crushing originates the heat Avhich melts the rocks, all the lavas ejected all over the line of the AA7eakest point of the earth's crust, which was broken and elevated by the contraction and consequent crumpling which ensued. This theory, it will be seen, is a purely mechanical one. But Mr. Mallet, by invoking the laws of phy7sics, endeavours to show that in this enormous crushing conse quent on the earth's crust accommodating itself to the contraction of the mould upon Fig. 90. \u2014 IDEAL SECTION OF VOLCANO IN ACTION. which it reposes, heat enough will be evolved to melt the rocks, and thus provide the lava squeezed to the surface. the world\u2014 though on this hypothesis derived from all kinds of rocks \u2014 are so extremely alike, be suggested, since it must at once pre sent itself to any one who judges Mr. Mallet's ingenious ideas from the standpoint of ascer tained facts. If once we could get over these primary obstacles to its acceptance the secondary ones might be kept in abeyance. We must, therefore, turn to the other theories which have been offered in explanation of vol canic disturbances. A lava reservoir is essen tial. This,' according to the vieAv we are about to state, may be found in the presence of de tached reservoirs in the crust of the earth, which are constantly filling and emptying. But how these cavities come to be in the centre No doubt, if we accept this doctrine, it is not difficult to prove, from the results of ex periments, that in the manner described the initial heat might be provided. But it is evidently invoked to avoid the difficulty of providing the ejected matter in any other way, since, on this hypothesis, the central molten nucleus cannot produce the lava ; for, as it cools, the nucleus must harden, and the solid crust, as it sinks doAvn to accommodate itself to the ever-contractina mould on which it floats, Avould not find anything molten enough to force to the surface."], [193, "CAUSES OF VOLCANIC ACTION. 181 of the solid rind has not been explained. It is, hoAvever^ more than possible that the con traction of the central molten interior of the earth is not uniform. The crust is at places thicker than at other spots, and the superin cumbent beds may be worse or better con ductors of heat; or other circumstances, of the nature of Avhich we are still ignorant, may have interfered Avith the regular secular cooling of the interior mass, so that large cavities communicating with the central nucleus are still unhardened, and after being emptied by a volcanic discharge, fill again by the welling up of the molten matter deeper doAvn. To cause the initial discharge, it is quite possible to accept Mr. Mallet's agency of crumpling up of rocks, and it Avould be wasting the utilisa tion of possibilities to reject his contention that heat is generated during this operation. But there is nothing incompatible in thinking that after a volcano has been established other causes may operate in determining the erup tions. Let us suppose the existence of such a cavity as that described above. Into it Avells lava from the source indicated, and over the lava intensely-heated steam must form from the infiltration of water in that form out of the surrounding rocks, until a time comes when the cavity can contain no more and an explosion ensues, Avhich bloAvs off the cover of the cauldron, and forms the \"pine tree-\" like cloud of steam which is almost invariably the first product of a volcanic eruption. Then into the vacant space the laAra Avells up, and pours skyward through the funnel formed or cleared by the discharge of steam. After a time the cavity is exhausted and the equili brium restored, until the feeder filling it more sloAvly than it was emptied by the volcanic vio lence, a second eruption is the consequence. It may sometimes happen that by some move ment in the interior of the earth, by some such derangement of the crust as might be caused by the contracting and crumbling which unquestionably exist, the connection between the reservoir and its fountain-head is cut off only to be re-established after a long period of quiescence such as is so fre quently noted in volcanoes, or possibly to be destroyed for ever when the volcano be comes Avhat Ave knoAv by the qualified term, \" extinct.\" All volcanoes, we have seen, discharge cer tain gases, and as the lava after its ejection con tinues to emit them, there is just reason to infer that at least some of these have been originally mixed with the molten rock. Some Avriters, indeed \u2014 among others, Tschermak * and Reyer t \u2014 will not hesitate to affirm that the activity of volcanoes is in no small degree due to the continual explosion and effervescence of these contained gases, just as Avater boils over a vessel by the expansion of the bubbles of steam in the Avater. This may possibly be true, for as Nature never does her Avork by one agent alone Avhen she has tAvo at her disposal, the earth in labour Avith a volcanic discharge calls unto its aid many forces. HoAvever, it seems to us that the theory here formulated, if not Avithout its draAvbacks, is more consonant with known laAvs and facts than any other. It enables us to correlate the physical as Avell as the physico-chemical hypotheses, and even to explain the curious discrepancies in the temperature of the earth at different places and at different depths (p. 83). Nor perhaps is it the less acceptable for the reason that while it does not reject altogether the old and still very generally received idea of a molten interior, it modifies this doctrine so far as to reconcile it with the vieAvs of all save the most extreme of the astronomers, who, Avithout being geologists, insist on regarding the earth as \" rigid as a ball of steel or cry/stal,\" Avhich we knoAv that it is not, J Avhile it enables us to dispense with Mr. Fisher's intermediate zone of molten material, which is rather harder * \" Ueber den Vulcanismus als kosmische Erscheinung \" sSitzungsberichten der K. Akademie der Wissenscliaften in Wien, 1877), p. 151. \u25a0)\u25a0 \"Eeitrag zur physik der Eruptionen\" (1877). \\ For some pertinent remarks on this subject, and on the unadvisability generally of shoemakers, no matter how skilful, going much beyond their lasts, the reader is re ferred to a letter of Professor Newberry in Science, Jan. 28th. 1887. This distinguished geologist advocates the old theory of the centre of the globe being liquid. At the same time the question of volcanic action is one so essen tially dependent on thermal laws that the physicist is quite as much concerned in its discussion as the geologist."], [194, "OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. 182 to hold with than the old doctrine Avhich it is intended to displace. is no reason for believing that the old volcanic discharges Avere more violent than the modern ones, or in any Avay different in action \u2014 do not bear out the dogma ; for many of them were 500 to 1,000 miles away from any body of Avater, and those of Central France and Ger many Avere almost as far from the ocean as the configuration of Europe would permit. Again, taking New Zealand, though Egmont and White Island are near or in the sea, Tuapu and Tongariro are in the centre of North Island. Captain Dutton, Avho has made these apt comments on the view under consideration, is scarcely less sceptical regard ing the equally Avidely-received and, as we have shown, more substantial doctrine of volcanoes taking a linear arrangement. It has a large amount of truth in it, but \" it has been enormously overloaded and ovenvorked by writers of general treatises.\" The occur rence of half-a-dozen to a dozen small cones upon a single line of fracture, fifteen to fifty miles in length, is frequent in districts where the volcanic action has been very diffuse. In South America the linear arrangement is very marked in the Andean cones, though there is no evidence to bear out the assertion that any six, or even any three, of them have been built up over the same line of fracture, as would be the case supposing Mallet's theory to be uni versally Avell founded; and if the same rule were to apply to the other volcanic belts it might possibly be found that the generalisa tion Avas not less faulty.* Having said this much, it is, perhaps, unne cessary to explain any of the many other theories which have been put forward to account for volcanic action, since we believe no one of any7 Aveight thinks of invoking them now-a-days. Nor will one of them keep together Avhen subjected to criticism. For instance, Sir Humphry Davy suggested that if immense quantities of the metallic bases of the earth and alkalies were pre sent in the interior of the earth, their oxi disation from contact Avith air and water Avould produce all the phenomena described. This theory, Avhich is absurd in spite of the force of its authority \u2014 since there is absolutely nothing to support it \u2014 Avas abandoned by Davy long before his death, though since then it has been taken up and advocated by Daubney and others. Like Bischof, Avho assumed that steam \u2014 derived from water acting on the assumed molten interior \u2014 was the agent Avhich in itiated volcanic action, these theorists placed great stress on the supposed fact that the large majority of volcanoes are situated near the sea coast. Darwin, on the other hand, con tended that volcanoes are almost solely found in those areas of the earth where subter ranean motive force is elevating, or has lately elevated, the crust of the globe, and are absent in those where the crust has sub sided, or is still subsiding. As for volcanoes being chiefly in the vicinity of the ocean, this very generally accepted generalisation is open to question. At all events, it has been over strained. For nearness, all depends upon what is meant by that term. If ten miles is re garded as near, then very feAv volcanoes are Avithin that distance of the ocean. If, on the other hand, we say two hundred and fifty, the statement holds good, but is shorn of a large part of its meaning. The great vol canoes of South America are distant, on an average, about one hundred and tAventy miles from the Pacific ; while the volcanoes active in America during the middle and late Ter tiary time \u2014 and here we may add that there * Dutton, in Science, Vol. VL, No. 137, pp. 255, 256: His remarks on the volcanic problem (\" Hawaiian Vol canoes,\" pp. 183-198) may also be profitably studied, though he occupies himself with the depressing task of bringing destructive criticism to bear against every hypothesis of volcanic action as yet advanced, without replacing them by one better fitted to bear examination. In fact, he is driven in despair to accept, as tiie only pos sibility in sight out of the perplexity, the hypothesis that, as the result of causes hitherto undiscovered, heat is generated in some localities within the earth, and that such local increments of heat produce all the phenomena of Vulcanism. Apart from the circumstance that the necessity for finding lava cavities and heat is not the most urgent factor in the solution of the problem, this is cutting the Gordian knot instead of untying it. It is, he admits, an arbitrary postulate \u2014 a simple appeal to a mystery. \" It is a chain with the primary links missing \u2014 an arch"], [195, "183 STRUCTURE OF VOLCANOES. Structure of Volcanoes. the ground being subsequently raised bodily into the cone-like position in AA-hich AA'e noAv find it. Consequently Von Buch, Avho A\\7as the author of this hypothesis, called such cones \" elevation craters.\" A volcano is, therefore \u2014 to condense the lessons Ave have learned in the preceding chapters \u2014 \" a more or less perfectly conical hill or mountain formed by the successive ac cumulation of ejected matter in a state of incandescence or high heat, and having one or more channels of communication Avith the interior of the earth, by which the ejections are effected.\" This definition, Avhich is Lyell's, is sufficiently comprehensive for all practical purposes, though, as we have seen, there may be volcanic eruption in which the discharge consists of lava only, without the existence of a cone or even of a crater (p. 163). These cases are, hoAvever, exceptional, and for our purposes may be regarded as non-existent. A typical volcano would, therefore, if cut down the middle, shoAv a funnel going up the centre of the cone and ending in a crater at one end and in the lava reservoir at the other (Figs. 55, 90, 91, 92). When the volcano becomes quiescent, or decreases in poAver, the chimney is apt to get filled up Avith ashes and other debris, Avhich fall out of it from the sides, and if the volcano has formed under the sea \u2014 as many of the old volcanoes did \u2014 then the structure of the mountain is complicated in various Avays, oAving to the Avater having taken charge of the lighter materials Avhen they were ejected, and rearranged them at its OAvn will. EA7en the Aveightier laAras, Avhen suddenly cooled under the pressure of a heavy mass of Avater, must differ widely from the same material, permitted to roll down the mountain side and consolidate sloAvly7, while bubbles of gas are being given off freely. At one time it Avas believed that firm lava, like what is found on the sides of so many volcanoes, could not possibly lie there, the slope being too steep for it, and that therefore when such an outpour Avas found in such a situation it must have originally fallen and cooled on flattish land, Such a doctrine is iioav knoAvn to be entirely erroneous, for it is found that not only will scoriaceous or vesicular lava consolidate on steep slopes, but from observations made in HaAvaii and on Etna it has been found that continuous beds of compact stone have formed on slopes of 15, 36, 38,and eA7en of 40 degrees, to a thickness of many feet, and that the different layers of the different outpourings overlie and underlie the beds of scori\u00e6 Avhich formed part of the same currents* Apart, therefore, from numerous proof's derived from the contour of the country, there is nothing in the nature of lava to support the soundness of the once popular but iioav exploded doctrine of cones having been elevated, or that they are not formed, as Ave have more than once indicated, by the materials thrown out by the crater, as, on a smaller scale and, of course, in a primarily different manner, the cone of a mole-hill is composed of the earth throAvn to the surface by the hving force be neath. In other words, volcanoes are Avhat the geographer knoAvs as \" Mountains of Ac cumulation,\" Avhether they are on a level plain or on the crest of mountains, crushed and squeezed into lofty ridges before the volcano came into existence. Some of the salient facts regarding volcanic discharges are Avell shoAvn in Mount Wellington (Figs. 93, 94), a long ex tinct volcano in the Auckland Isthmus, in New Zealand, which shoAvs an instructive series of craters and cones. The oldest bed is a layer of tufa (c), Avhich is cut through by a road (e-f), and in the northern section of the road the layers of this tufa are very perfectly shoAvn ; these beds have a slope of from eight to ten degrees. In the crater from Avhich the tufa was discharged stands a cone of slag Avith two small crater-like holloAvs. The streams of lava Avhich proceeded from these old points of eruption shoAv here and there in the without a keystone.\" It undoubtedly sweeps away the difficulties which encounter all other hypotheses, but it substitutes a perplexity as great as all the others put together. But probably the missing link may yet be found, and the unquarried keystone put in its proper place ! * Lyell: Philosophical Transactions, 1858."], [196, "184 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. the entire structure is a mass of tufa divided into beds, and rising in a gentle slope from the level ground (a). The formation of this sec tion of the volcano indicates that at the outset the early discharges were under the sea \u2014 the shape of stony sheets in the bottom of the tufa crater (g). After what appears to have been approximately a long period of quiescence, a new eruption seems to have poured over the southern edge of the crater.

Every considerable volcanic mass which owes its existence to a long-continued course of eruptions, becomes in this way a more or less complicated collection of these simple outfloAvs and discharges, which we have briefly described as composing the cones of Mount Wellington.

The tendency of the volcanic force to seek neAv channels is, indeed, so marked that it is rash to say7 that any volcano is extinct, for some seat of volcanic force, Avhich for ages has remained quiescent, may, Avhen least expected, be suddenly tapped or subjected to the still unknown conditions which precipitate an eruption.

Such cupola-like remains of ancient volcanoes have been described by Von Seebach as \" ho mogeneous.\" * And though possibly enough some of these bosses of trachyte or phonolite may have been mere outpourings of lava on the surface \u2014 as in Fig. 55, Avhere the surplus is floAving off in a sheet \u2014 in the greater number of instances they are too regular not to have been cast in some such mould as that indi cated, and even when a sheet-like prolong ation is noticed, this may be merely a lava flow through the side of the cone of loose ashes and debris, which has long ago disap peared. developed by the rising lava will melt part of the interior of the mountain, Avhich has been burst through and broken into frag ments, so that in time a vast hollow must form immediately beneath the point Avhere the debris are discharged through the funnel, albeit this funnel may be a very short one. In this Avay the cone may not be so much a conical accumulation of volcanic ejecta, cut through by a narroAV shaft-like chimney, as a holloAv hill. Looking at it in this Avay, the outer walls of an active volcano rich in lava represent a mantle of layers of debris cover ing a hollow interior, Avhich, before an erup tion, is filled up of lava Avelling up from below, and after the eruption again becoming empty, the lava still undischarged sinking back into the reservoir from Avhence it came. This holloAv may be called the lavaraum, or lava space (Fig. 92). The presumed existence of this interior structure explains the frequency of eruptions bursting forth from the fissures on the side of the cone (p. 185). This theory again enables us to understand two peculiarities Avhich are commonly found, though in some respects the two are fundamentally the opposite of each other. In the first place it is frequently noticed that rounded bosses \u2014 the \"vulkanische kup pen \" of the Germans \u2014 composed of masses of lava, seem to have poured out on the surface, and there remained in the shape of a dome-like hilL On the other hand, Ave have seen that in ringed volcanoes, when the top of the cone is bloAvn off' it leaves an extensive kettle or caldera, inside of which very often a second cone will form, and if the head of this meets the like fate, a third cone. HoAvever, we can imagine one of tAvo things happening to a volcano Avhen the eruption ceases. In the first case the crater of a volcano closes gradually, Avhile the pressure from beloAv is still sufficient to fill the interior holloAv with liquid lava, Avithout, hoAve ver, causing any eruption through the crater or the fissures in the sides. In this case a kernel of stony lava will form inside the \" mantle \" which covers this cone, this ker nel, on account of its sIoav cooling, having a much more crystalline structure than the older In the second case, when the activity of a volcano has stopped suddenly, either on account of an earthquake interfering with the direction of the subterranean forces, or on account of an eruption through a neighbouring crater, then the lava inside the crater will as suddenly sink out of sight and the cone will remain holloAv, Avith an open or slightly covered crater. After a time, either by one of those immense subsidences by which the shell of huge volcanoes falls in, or by the top being bodily bloAvn off by a sudden blast of steam, heralding a fresh eruption, all that remains of the original cone is the base, with an enormous caldera \u2014 the remnants of the pristine hollow (p. 129). Then if a fresh eruption occurs, a second cone will form inside the ringed volcano, as in Vesuvius, with an \" atrio,\" or valley-like space, between them. For this kind of volcano \u2014 unlike the other or \" homogeneous \" one \u2014 cannot, as a rule, be extinguished for ever; the activity may begin again after a shorter or longer period of repose, the funnel being nearly choked up with loose debris, or even * Zeitsch rift der Beutsch Geologische Gesellschaft, Vol. XVIIL, p. 643 ; Von Hochstetter : \" Ueber den innern bau der vulkane \" (Neiics Ja.hrbucli), &c, 1871, p. 469 ; and the works of Verbeek on Sumatra and Krakatau (p. 162)."], [199, "MOUNTAINS OF ELEVATION. 187 open for the continuous discharge of steam and gases. elements.

It is thus evident that all volcanic mountains are mountains of accumulation ; that is to say, they build up themselves, and, though the creatures of subterranean violence, do not Fig. 95.\u2014 PROFILE OF THE ALLEGHANT MOUNTAINS, NORTH AMERICA. m, Miocene beds ; e, Eocene beds; k, Cretaceous formation ; n, Permian (New Red Sandstone) ; c, Carboniferous formation ; d, Devonian ; si, Silurian ; krs, Crystalline schists. necessarily infer the prior existence of those prodigious upheavals and disturbances of the strata Avhich have given birth to the mountains Avhich form the subject of this section.

But it is more to our purpose to note that mountain ranges enclose \"basins or trough-like areas\" \u2014 concavities betAveen the convexities of the folds. It is also noticed that the crumpling of the rocks increases as Ave approach the axis of the range, those on the slopes being less disturbed than those which form the ridge ; and that in every case the axis of their long folds is parallel to the length of the chain. This shoAvs that the forces acting on the rocks must have been from the sides. Nor, in studying this subject, must we omit to notice that the rocks thus crumpled are, in the central part of the chain, frequently metamorphosed, as if they had been subjected to the combined action of heat and pressure, which, as we have already seen, are important metamorphic agents, heat likewise resulting from the crushing of great rock masses (p. 180). It is also in evidence (p. 46) that there have been repeated upheaval and subsidence of some mountain chains \u2014 of the Alps, for example, before the range took its final elevation \u2014 facts which we ascertain chiefly by the uncon formability of the beds of different ages. This, it is needless to point out, complicates the structure of those oft-disturbed alpine masses. Mountains are, however, sometimes of great age, though it does not always folloAv that These facts, Avhatever may be their explana tion, are unquestionable. In trying to account for them we must examine the lie and the position of the chief ranges which OAve their elevation to plications of this character. Most ranges we find are composed of rocks which have been subjected to this lateral compres sion, so that the phenomenon is not of local, but of universal occurrence, and must, there fore, be explained by a cause of equally wide application. We also see that these ranges are of Avidely different ages, so that they must have been elevated at widely different periods in the Avorld's history ; and, what is more, there are good evidences for showing that they have been elevated to their present position by several successive upheavals. It has also been pointed out by Dana and other writers, that mountain ranges are chiefly developed along the borders of continents, and that the highest mountain ranges face the largest and deepest continents. But even admitting this generalisation to be true in the majority of instances \u2014 though the exceptions are neither feAv nor unimportant, \u2014 the distribution of sea and land has so considerably altered since the Fig. 97. \u2014 SECTION THROUGH THE CHAIN OF MONT BLANC.

On the other hand, the Alps are among the youngest of the family of mountains, so that the phrase, as \"old as the hills,\" is to the geologist a very relative term. The neAvest rocks are old compared with man and his organic surroundings. But the Alps, for instance, are of yesterday Avhen their remoteness is put into comparison commodate itself to the diminished size of the mould on Avhich it rests or floats, is the most probable means whereby this crushing, lateral squeezing and folding of rocks could haA7e been accomplished (pp. 36, 85). This contraction we have already invoked as the cause of secular rise and fall (p. 175), and we haA7e seen that, hypothesis though it is, it has been considered by Mallet as the chief cause of volcanic action (p. 180). To accept this theory it is necessary to hold by the old idea of the molten nucleus, covered by a hardened rind, in which the Fig. 98. \u2014 PROFILE OF THE CENTRAL CHAIN OF THE EASTERN ALPS. Avith the still more incalculable antiquity of others which may be found at a feAv miles' distance from them. In like manner, it is not consonant Avith geological knowledge to say that \" the hills endure for aye.\" On the contrary, it is perfectly certain that they are Avearing away every minute, and that since they were first called into being vast masses of rock have been removed from them by the influence of agents still busy at Avork \u2014 to Avit, water in its various forms. In truth, stratified rocks are superimposed ; and perhaps for all practical purposes it is as safe a vieAv to cling to as any other, more especially since, by the observations of Hennessy and Delauney, considerable doubts have been throAvn on the soundness of a theory7 which depends on the supposed influence of the moon in producing tides on a thin crust. If so, Ave can hardly doubt that such a central nucleus might be cooling, though slowly7, for if the fountain-head of internal heat is not constantly7 being re newed, the prodigious amount of Avarmth given off by volcanoes alone \u2014 leaving out of account the constant loss by radiation \u2014 must sensibly decrease its external temperature, and, of course, as cooling causes contraction, its bulk. The rest is a natural sequence. It might at first sight be imagined that a rigid rock is incapable of bending in the manner shoAvn in Figs. 95 \u2014 98, or in Fig. 99. But it is clear that they must have yielded to strain, since there is nothing more certain than that they Avere not laid doAvn in this shape, nor crumpled while they Avere soft, and certain facts tend to sIioav that even the most rigid \" The hills are shadows, and they flow From form to form, and nothing stands They melt like mist, the solid lauds, Like clouds they shape themselves and go.

We have, hoAvever, seen enough of the difficulties Avhich face any one Avhen dealing with the possibilities depending on the action of an internal force, the very existence of Avhich is only hypothetical, to be prepared for the doctrine of mountains of elevation being due to secular contraction not receiving universal acceptance. Naturally, the advo cates of a solid terrestrial nucleus cannot hold Avith it; nor is it in accordance with human nature for the physicists Avho find the solution of so many problems in a liquid zone between the external crust and the supposed solid nucleus to acquiesce in a hypothesis which dispenses Avith both. Other theorists Avill admit that though it may be equal to the production of folds like what Ave find in many strata (p. 74), it is asking more than contraction, and the consequent subsi dence folloAved by crumpling into ridges, can supply. Mr. Fisher, for example, Avhile ad mitting that the wrinkles on the face of the globe have been produced by lateral pressure, denies that secular cooling is adequate to their bodies may under certain conditions be bent in a manner quite as remarkable as anything seen in the earth's crust. Lateral pressure also produces such folds. The experiment of Sir James Hall, Avhich consisted in subjecting layers of cloth under heavy weights to lateral pressure, is Avell knoAvn. It resulted in the mass shoAving folds in appearance very much the same as those in rocks believed to have been exposed to similar treatment on a larger scale. Again, even better results Avere obtained in an experiment of M. Favre's Avith layers of plastic clay and india-rubber, placed under con ditions much the same as Hall's layers of cloth (Fig. 99). This crumpling demands the ac ceptance of some such hypothesis as that mentioned, for it is clear that if the earth's crust only just serves to envelop the interior in its crumpled form, it must when smoothed out have covered a much larger area. In other Avords, the earth if \" ironed out \" would be a great deal larger than it is, Avith so many of the plaits on its surface, in the shape of moun tain ranges. It also follows \u2014 though this is Fig. 99. \u2014 SHOWING THE ARTIFICIAL FOLDS PRODUCED IN A SERIES OF LAYERS OF CLAY AND INDIA- RUBBER, ACCORDING TO AN EXPERIMENT OF ALPHONSE FAVRE, (The arrows show the direction of the contraction.) not theory, but fact \u2014 that in a wrinkled district, Avith the strata folded in the manner portrayed, the synclines, or troughs (p. 74) Avould form the valleys and the anticlines, or saddles, the ridges. In a few cases this really happens, though again the influence of the elements so acts upon the plaited beds that, as in Fig. 35, a valley may often be found on the crest of an anticline, and it is quite possible to imagine that by the continuous action of the same process of degradation, a syncline of hard beds would remain in the shape of a hill, Avhile the anti cline had left nothing save a hollow behind it. production \u2014 a contention which he endeavours to support by various ingenious arguments of a very technical character. Captain Dutton will even go farther, and declare that mountain ridges could not possibly be pro duced by any such hypothetical secular con traction ; for the strains set up in the crust by a shrinking nucleus would be such that for any given amount of corrugation Avith the axis of the folds in one direction, there must be an equal amount with the axis at right angles to that direction. Hence, instead of having lofty mountain ridges, in long"], [203, "CAUSES OF UPHEAVAL. 191 narrow belts, with the axis of the folds all approximately parallel, and with no corre sponding plication at right angles to them, the earth Avould be covered with a netAvork of Avrinkles, the ridges of Avhich would not equal any but the lowest ranges of mountains. Ac cordingly, this ruthless iconoclast declares that the great interior of the earth has not as j7et imdergone any sensible amount of cooling, and therefore, that being the case, it is calculating Avithout one's host to infer such Aveighty consequences from the hypo thesis of a shrinking nucleus, with an out ward shell following it doAvnward, and crushing, and crumpling, and localising its collapse at the weakest points in its peri phery* All of which (it seems to us) is doing Avhat the critic stigmatises in his opponents \u2014 assuming something, and then arguing on the assumption. The only substitute for the hypothesis described which it is necessary to notices is that which \u2014 accepting George Dar win's conclusion that geologic time has wit nessed a notable shortening of the equatorial diameter of the earth, with a corresponding lengthening of its polar diameter (an ex tremely questionable inference) \u2014 finds in this change of figure a \" surplusage,\" and conse quent shrinkage of the crust. The readjust ment of the crust to the less flattened spheroid involves not only a diminution of its area, but the institution of a system of shearing and other strains calculated to Avrinkle the surface in all parts except the Polar regions, and to produce Avhat is actually observed \u2014 a maxi mum effect within the zone of the equatorial bulge. In the lunar tidal influence, the authors of this hypothesis find an independent reason for the prevailing meridional trend of the corrugations on the earth's surface. They see in the lagging of the tide a force tend ing to slip the tidal crust westAvards ; and this Avould result, during the ages of crust forma tion, in an ingrained meridional structure, Avhich Avould in turn determine the trend of subsequent folds consequent on surplusage. % This ingenious \" explanation \" is, hoAvever, still subjudice. But it may serve to shoAv how diffi cult it is to find a fitting solution of problems the terms of which have been stated in the daAvn of creation, and to a large extent in a region which it is vain for any one less for tunate than the voyageurs of Jules Verne ever to reach. The facts are, hoAvever, indisputable. The folding, crushing, and elevation of strata at one time lying flat at the bottom of the sea being visible and tangible, afford some solid material for the consolation of the geologist amid the perplexity of the themes Avhich they have evoked. \u00a7 J AVinchell and Taylor : Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1885.

Few of them play more than five or six minutes at a time, and the intervals between their periods of repose and of ac- tivity vary so much that it has been stated at all times \u2014 from thirty hours down to eleven times daily for those of Iceland, and from twenty-flve or more hours down to fifty minutes in those of the Yellowstone country in North America. The \"Old Faithful\" geyser in this region is so regular in its operations, and they occur so frequently, that they afford unusual opportunities for ob- servation. It is in the centre of a mound or table, nearly twelve feet above the surround- ing level, and formed of the geyserite, or loose, porous silica deposited from the water thrown up, this deposit being arranged in a succession of small steps which constitute a series of little basins. Near the top of these basins are beautiful broad, shallow pools, with pink, cream -white, brown, and grey bottoms, in which the deep azure-tinted water stands after an eruption. The crater through which the water is discharged forms a basin, at the bottom of which is an irregular orifice, the head of the geyser tube. The eruption begins with some preliminary splashes or spurts, from three to a dozen or more, like abortive attempts at eruption. These con- tinue for about four minutes, becoming more and more powerful, when they are followed by a rapid succession of jets, which escape with a roar and soon attain the maximum height that is, about 130 feet.

Water, we know, is discharged out of craters ; but this water is, in all likelihood, only surface accumulations, or derived from reservoirs at no great depth. The steam we have already discussed, and the muddy- stream Avhich so often accompanies a volcanic outburst has been accounted for. But boiling Avater, mud, and various gases may be discharged from the earth under conditions almost identical Avith those which attend the discharge of lava. These emanations form some of the most interesting of displays, and, apart from their scientific importance, deserve consideration merely from a picturesque point of view.

When the geyser is not in action, the Avater in the basin over the tube is in constant motion. Paijkull, by throwing bits of paper into the basin, shoAved that the hot Avater rising from the tube is draAvn sloAvly tOAvards the edges, Avhen it sinks and ffoAvs back along the bottom ofthe basin, so that the temperature of the basin is a constantly shifting one. The steam from the geyser has an odour of sulphuretted hydrogen, and the Avater has also a slight, though only passing, taste of the same gas. The Great Geyser has tAvo kinds of eruptions \u2014 in this respect resem bling some of the YelloAvstone spouters, especially the Union in the Shoshone Basin, and the Castle, and Giant in the Upper Basin of Fire Hole River. After the minor eruptions the Avater does not sink, although their pre cursors are the same rumbling subterranean noises Avhich herald the greater discharges. The former occur every hour and a half to two hours, and become stronger and more frequent as the period for a great upburst is approached. These minor upheavals \u2014 or that by throAving a great quantity of large stones into the pipe of the geyser an erup tion can be hastened, tourists have begun to adopt the practice of choking the throats of these fountains Avith stones \u2014 \" an indi gestible bolus,\" Avhich, according to Professor Barrett, \" often proves a fatal dose to a geyser.\" Then, as if the projecting force had been pent up, the stones and turf, as well as the boiling Avater, are throAvn to a greater height than usual, though it has been noticed that the gey/ser, seemingly exhausted by the effort, does not achieve a fresh eruption after the lapse of the ordinary interval of rest. All of the Avater ejected by geysers contains more or less silica in some form, and, in the case of those in NeAv Zealand, much common salt and other mineral and even metallic matter, Avhich, Avhen the Avater evaporates, remains behind in the form of flinty \" sinter,\" or in sheets covering the adjacent country for several mdes, and deposits itself along the margins of the basins in the shape of beauti fully fretted rims, surrounding pools, Avhich, Avhen the hot springs issue on the side of a slope, give them the appearance of a terrace (see Fig. 6 and Fig. 101) ; for though the term \"gey/ser\" is confined to spouting springs, it will be seen that the distinction between these and the unintermittent ones is not very Avell marked. \" conical water hills,\" as Bunsen calls them \u2014 consist of a succession of jets, each jet attain ing a greater and greater height, until the maximum is attained. After the eruption is over the column disappears from the basin and sinks about ten feet in the tube, only resuming its old level in the basin after an interval of from tAvo to seven hours. The most common interval betAveen the end of one and the beginning of another eruption is thirty hours \u2014 though eruptions sometimes occur every six hours, \u2014 the duration of the discharge varying from five to twenty minutes, the height reached by the column of water being stated at all elevations from forty7 to 360 feet ; the mean may perhaps be taken at something over one hundred feet, Avhile the temperature runs from 180\u00b0 to 219\u00b0.

We Avere singularly fortunate, as, from Avhat Ave Avere told, feAV eruptions of late (1861) haA7e lasted more than four or fiA-e minutes, or attained half the height ofthis Avhich Ave had just witnessed.\" Before 1789, the Strokhr \u2014 or churner \u2014 Avas an inconsiderable spring, the name being at that date applied to another geyser, which has since then become a quiet spring. Unlike the Great Geyser, from which it is distant 120 yards, the Strokhr has no regular basin : the tube gradually narrows from a diameter of 9 feet at the surface to 10 inches at 27 feet beloAv the surface. In this' funnel-shaped tube the Avater is usually from 9 to 10 feet beloAv the surface, and is generally- at or near the boiling-point all the time, being in a state of constant ebullition except just before an eruption, Avhich begins Avithout any7 pre monitory detonations, as is the case of the Great Gey7ser. There is an interval of from six to tAvelve hours betAveen the eruptions, which can be hastened by choking up the tube with turf and stones, this plug preventing the dis engagement of the steam, and increasing the pressure which finally removes the impedi ment Avith a sudden force. The height to Avhich the column rises has been estimated at from 40 to 162 feet, Avhile the duration of an eruption is rarely over one hour. Tho Little Geyser spouts only from 10 to 20 feet about eveiy tAvo hours, and the Roarer, Avhich, previous to 1789, even rivalled the Great Geyser, gradually diminished after the earth quake of that year, and finally ceased to spout, a fact of some importance in consider ing the cause of these eruptiA7e fountains of hot Avater. Yellowstone Region. \u2014 A geyser country even more remarkable for the size and the number of its spouting fountains is the YelloAv stone region in the north-Avest part of the Territory of AVyoming in the United States, Avhich, by a special Act of Congress, has been reserved as a National Park, exempt from settlement, purchase, or pre-emption. Here nearly every form of geyser and uninter mittent hot spring occurs, with all the silicious and other deposits from them. Of the latter, Dr. Peale \u2014 to whom Ave are in debted for nearly all of the facts relating to this section of our subject \u2014 enumerates 2,195, and considers that Avithin the limits of the park \u2014 which is 55 miles by 65 miles. and includes 2,288,000 acres \u2014 as many as 3,000 actually- exist. The same geologist"], [208, "196 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. notes the existence of 71 geysers in the area mentioned, though some of the number are only inferred to be spouting springs because of the form of their basins, and the character of the surrounding deposits. Of this vast collection of still and eruptive springs, betAveen Avhich there seems every gradation, those Avhich do not send water into the air are, OAving to the magnificent cascades Avhich they7 form (Fig. 101), often quite as remarkable as those Avhich take the shape of geysers. A few of the latter may, hoAvever, be briefly noticed. escape of water during an eruption. It plays several times in the course of the tAventy-four hours, and sends a column of Avater 60 feet high, the eruption lasting an hour. As yet, hoAvever, the force of the Avater has not been sufficient, or of sufficiently long duration, to break through the arches covering the basin or crater. The Excelsior \u2014 noAv claimed to be the largest of its order, which sends Avater 300 feet into the air at intervals of about five hours, and of such volume as to Avash away bridges over small streams beloAv \u2014 Avas not, until comparatively recent years, knoAvn to be the poAverful geyser it is. But if it had for a time Avaned in importance, its immense crater, 330 feet in length, and 200 feet at the Avidest part, shoAvs that at a still earlier date it was a gigantic fountain. In this deep pit, Avhen the breeze wafts aside the clouds of steam con stantly rising from its surface, the Avater can be seen seething 15 or 20 feet beloAv the surrounding level. Yet into the cauldron of boiling water a little stream of cold Avater, from the melting snow of the uplands, runs unceasingly. In the Gibbon Geyser Basin is one Avhich has broken out Avithin a short period. In 1878 this gey7ser consisted of tAvo steam holes, roaring on the side of a hill, that looked just as if they had burst through the surface ; and the gully leading tOAvards the ravine Avas at that date filled Avith sand, Avhich appeared to have been poured out during an eruption. Dead trees stood on the line of this sand floor, and others Avith their bark still remaining, and even Avith their foliage not lost, Avere uprooted hard by, everything pointing to the \" steam boat vent,\" as it was called, having been of recent formation. In 1875 it had no ex istence, but in 1879 this geyser, Avhich first opened, it is believed, on the 11th of August in the preceding year, had \"settled doAvn to business as a very poAverful floAving geyser\" with a double period, one eruption occurring every half hour, and projecting Avater to the height of 30 feet, the main eruption occurring every six or seven dayrs, Avith long-continued action, and a column of nearly 100 feet. The Castle Geyser is so named on account of the fancied resemblance Avhich its mound of. Avhite and grey deposit presents to the ruins of a feudal keep, the crater itself being placed on a cone or turret, which has a someAvhat imposing appearance compared Avith the other geysers in the neighbourhood. It throAVS a column usually about fifty or sixty feet high, at intervals of two or three hours, but some times the discharge shoots up much higher. Lord Dunraven, indeed, reckoned the column Avhich he saw to measure fully 250 feet, though as the eruption is accompanied with a voluminous discharge of steam Avhich reaches much higher than the Avater, it is possible that this observer 'over-estimates the height to Avhich it attained. The NeAv Geyser in the same basin is also of very recent origin. It consists of tAvo fissures in the rock, in Avhich the water is boiling vigorously. But there is no mound, and the rocks of the fissure are just beginning to get a coating of the silicious geyserite de posited from the Avater, so that it cannot have long been spouting.

Mr. Stanley saw one eruption Avhich he calculated to have shot a column of Avater to the height of more than 200 feet. At first it seemed as if the geyser Avas only making a feint, the discharge which preceded the great one being merely repeated several times, folloAved by a cessation both of the rumbling noises and of the ejec tion of Avater. But soon, after a premonitory7 cloud of steam, the geyser began Avork in earnest, the column discharged, rising higher and higher, until it reached the altitude men tioned. \" At first it appeared to labour in raising the immense volume, Avhich seemed loath to start on its heavemvard tour ; but it Avas Avith perfect ease that the stupendous column Avas held to its place, the water break ing into jets and returning in glittering showers to the basin.

The waving to and fro of such a gigantic fountain Avhen the column is at its highest, The only other geysers in this remarkable geyserland Avhich Ave can spare room to notice are those knoAvn as the Giantess, the Beehive, and the Grand. The Giantess sends a column of Avater to the height of 250 feet. An erup tion is usually divided into three periods \u2014 tAvo preliminary efforts and a final one, divided from each other by intervals of betAveen one and tAvo hours, Avhile the intervals betAveen the periods of discharge are very long. Some times it does not play for several Aveeks. The Beehive, which is 400 feet from the Giantess, gets its name from the peculiar beehive-like cone Avhich it has formed. The eruption is also almost unique. It is heralded by a slight escape of steam, which is folloAved by a column of steam and Avater, shooting to the height of over 200 feet. The column is'some- Avhat fan-shaped, but it does not fall in rain, the spray7 being evaporated and carried off as steam, if, indeed, there is not more steam than Avater in the column.

In the basin of the Mississippi River, and on the plains east of the Rocky Mountains, there are no thermal springs \u2014 a fact Avhich has not been lost sight of by those theorists Avho attribute the heat to Avhich they owe their origin to mountain corrugation. Outside of the National Park the greatest development of hot springs is in California and Nevada, though they are not Avanting in the region north of those States, several being found in British Columbia, at Banff, in the North-West Territory, Avhere a Canadian National Park is to be formed, and, it is said, in Alaska, though Ave are not aware of any existing in Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands, or in the coast region of British Columbia and the country immediately south of that province. Spouting springs are, hoAv ever, less frequent. In California the gey7sers are chiefly7 in Napa Valley, north of San Francisco, Avhere, in a canon or defile, covered Avith deposits of extinct fountains, there are numerous steam jets and hot springs, some clear, some turbid, some chalybeate, some sulphurous, and some impregnated Avith alum. This ravine is always thick Avith the steam rising from these jets, or from basins like the \" Witches' Cauldron,\" which is in a constant state of ebullition. The Steamboat Geyser discharges steam to a height of from 50 to 100 feet, Avith a roar like the escape from a steamer. But feAV of the fountains in this canon are regular geysers \u2014 most of them only discharging steam, or in exceptional cases throwing up Avater to the height of tAvo feet, or even as high as fifteen or tAventy feet. The Steamboat springs in Washpe Valley, east of the Virginian range in Nevada State, are more of the nature of the YelloAvstone Park geysers, the deposit from their waters being true geyserite, though in no case is water or steam ejected higher than from ten to tAventy feet. The Grand is one of the most important in the Upper Geyser basin. Yet, unlike the Grotto, the Giant, or the Old Faithful (p. 192), it has no raised cone or crater, and a much less cavern-like boAvl than the Giantess and other geysers. The column discharged ascends to the height of from 80 to 200 feet, and the eruptions last from fifteen minutes to three quarters of an hour, with intervals on an average of from seven to tAventy hours. This fountain is evidently very irregular in its action, though it is just possible that Avhen the Yellowstone geysers have been more consecutively studied, it Avill be found that these seeming irregularities depend on the vaiying supplies of Avater at different times of the year. The YelloAvstone National Park is, indeed, a region of thermal Avaters of every descrip- tion. Scarcely7 a foot of the 3,575 square miles of the area is not honeycombed by active, passive, or extinct fountains of this description, or covered by the fantastic and often loA7elj7 concretions formed by the silicious and calcareous deposits from these boiling waters which rise to the surface. Steam rises out of the soil in the most unexpected places, and the pedestrian has to tread Avarily lest, Avhen he least expects it, the ground may subside under his feet, and, by the crushing of the thin crust, he be precipitated into a boiling pool or bubbling cauldron of mud. It is truly a \" Avonderland.\" Yet in all this region there is not one volcano, either active or extinct, since the arguments for believing that Mount Washburne is an old crater are very fragile. The National Park, therefore, differs from Iceland, where the geysers are in near proximity to actiVe volcanoes, and New Zealand. Avhere, as Ave shall presently see, the geyser region is also one of busy volcanic energy. Other Parts of America. \u2014 The Yellowstone country is, however, not the only gey7ser land of America.

At one period it must have been a volcano of the usual order, but in the course of time it has become exhausted, and is now in what is knoAvn as the \" Solfatara \" stag. In its vicinity are geysers and boiling springs, Avhich at all times evolve volumes of steam and sulphurous gas, to the latter of Avhich are due the sulphur beds noAV Avorked on the island. Its entire area is covered Avith silicious sinter, and Lake Hope, occupying an area of fifteen acres, is an acid geyser lake of the temperature of 110\u00b0. From one part of this lake, Sir James Hector describes water spouting to the height of 100 feet. This island lies in the line of active thermal action, Avhich stretches across the North island to Mount Tongariro, a distance of about 150 miles, the average breadth of the volcanic belt being about 40 miles. About 80 miles inland the hot lakes country is reached. Here Ave find a region elevated 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the level of the sea, and in its physical features embracing far-stretching pumice plains, \" intersected in every direction by high ranges of igneous formation, Avhich are relieved here and there by enormous volcanic cones,\" varying in height from 1,000 to 9,000 feet. \" Extensive forests of extra ordinary luxuriance and beauty clothe the mountains and border the extensive plateaux, Avhile hot lakes, boiling geysers, and thermal springs are dotted far and wide over the country.\" The lovely Lake Rotorua is everywhere bordered by distinct traces of fire and Avater combined, in the shape of silicious and sulphurous deposits, the result of the hydro thermal action of the all-abounding geysers, hot springs, mud-holes, solfataras, and fuma roles \u2014 or points at which volcanic vapours an copiously discharged \u2014 Avith Avhich the country is riddled. Lake Rotoiti is of much the same character, while the Avaters of the Avarm lakes, knoAvn as Rotoma and Rotoehu, are rendered of a greyish opaque colour by the action of fifty feet, Avith a noise so great that during the discharge they droAvn the voices of men. Similar jets issue from the middle of the adjacent RiA7er Lakii chu, and most probably many7 other geysers exist in this high plateau of Central Asia. Thermal springs are nume rous in Japan, Formosa, the Malay Islands and Peninsula, Australasia, and Polynesia. Japan is said to have veritable geysers, though those hitherto described scarcely deserve that name, and pseudo-geysers are also found in the island of Formosa. In Celebes, hoAvever, geysers of the ordinary character exist on the Peninsula of Minhassa, though not of a character so remarkable as to deserve a lengthened description. Indeed, the eruptions of the one at Nolok are not periodical, the ejection of water occurring only at certain seasons and under peculiar circumstances. There are, hoAvever, various mud volcanoes Avhich, as we shall see presently7, may be regarded as geysers, from which mud, instead of Avater, is ejected (Fig. 103). Near Dempo Volcano, in Sumatra, there is in a crater a lake of seething mud, which Mr. Forbes describes as being \" SAvalloAved up and vomited forth once in every fifteen to twenty minutes',\" the contents being quietly ejected to the height of \" some hundreds of feet.\" New Zealand. \u2014 The Northern island of New Zealand is a geyserland only second to that of the YelloAvstone ; for though its spouting fountains are not so remarkable as those of Iceland, the beauty of their sinter-lined basins and of the terraces similar to those on Gar diner's River (Fig. 101), which, until recently7, Avere the great sights of the colony, gave that part of the Avorld a claim to distinction Avhich Iceland does not possess. All of the \" Lake region,\" as it is called, from the presence Avithin this area of Taupo, TaraAvera, Rotorua, Mokoia, Rotomahana, and other sheets of water, is a region of even more intense vol canic action than those described. For not only are geysers, hot springs, mud pools, etc., present, but earthquakes are not unfrequent, and the entire country is studded Avith active and extinct volcanoes.

Lake TaraAvera, Avith its cluster of minor lakes, is right in the centre of this zone of volcanic activity. On its southern shores Mount TaraAvera \u2014 a truncated volcanic cone 1,964 feet high \u2014 is situated, its summit, until the outburst of 1886, being a sort of tableland, divided by crater-like ravines, showing that it must have long been quiescent. On the western side of Tarawera a range of conical volcanic hills stretches to the shores of Lake Rotomahana, surrounded by hot springs, and, until 1886, by the Avonder ful Pink and White terraces (p. 16), formed by the silica-laden Avater of the neighbouring geysers.

The rivers taking their rise in this mountain are Avhite Avith sulphur and other deposits, Avhich they cut through in their swift course to the loAvlands.* Of the numerous spouting fountains thus briefly noticed, one of the most remark able was Ngahapu, at the back of what Avas until lately- known as Te Tarata, or the White Terrace, close to Rotomahana, or the Warm Lake (Figs. 106, 107),t Avhich, after boiling up in huge hot Avaves that \" lashed themselves into fury against the rugged sides of the * Kerry-Nicholls, in the Times, Aug. 5th and 11th, 188fi ; and \" The King Country \" (1884). t In the Maori language the word \" roto \" means \" lake.\" Hence Roto-rua, \" lake number two : \" Roto-ma, \" white lake ; \" Roto-punamu. \" green lake ; \" Roto-eha, \" muddy lake ;\" Roto-makariri, \" cold lake ; \" etc. The term \" ngawha ' ' is employed to designate non-intermittent springs and sol fataras. \" Picca \" is a geyser or geyser-like fountain ; while, according to Mr. Kerry-Nicholls, '\u2022 waiariki\" means a spring suitable for bathir.;;."], [219, "GEYSERS OF NEW ZEALAND. 207 Immense clouds of steam played over the basin which supplied the material out of Avhich this terrace Avas composed. These clouds of steam, AA-hile reflecting the beautiful blue of the basin generally, so obscured the Avater that it Avas only at intervals that it could be seen. But the loveliest portion of Te Tarata Avas what resulted from the deposi tion of the silica from the Avaste Avater of the geyser as it floAved doAvn the slope to the lake. These incrustations formed on the face of the hill a system of terraces which \u2014 as Dr. Ferdinand v. Hochstetter, writing in 1863, put it \u2014 looked as white as if cut from marble. They presented the appearance of a \" cataract plunging over natural shelves, Avhich, as it falls, is suddenly turned into stone. The flat spreading foot of the terraces extends far into the lake. There the terraces commence with low shelves, containing shalloAv Avater basins. The farther up, the higher groAv the terraces ing fall. After reaching the highest terrace there is an extensive platform, AA-ith a number of basins five to six feet deep, their waters shoAving a temperature of 90\u00b0 to 110\u00b0. In the middle of this platform there arises, close to the brink of the main basin, a kind of rock island, about twelve feet high, decked AA-ith ' manuka,' * mosses, lycopodium, and fern. It may be visited Avithout danger, and from it the traveller has a fair and full view into the blue, boiling, and steaming caldron.\" Those who have seen these terraces \u2014 they no longer exist \u2014 vie Avith each other in praise of their beauty. Some of these descrip tions, indeed, partake of the rhapsodical. The chaste design ; the unique, delicate beauty ; the sublime detail of construction ; the fairy like scene \u2014 are all enlarged upon ; Avhile the sparkling Avater, glittering in the sun as it rippled over the marble-like terraces formed by itself, gave the entire slope the appearance of some enchanted palace decked with diamonds and myriads of other precious stones. At Orakeikorako, on the Waikato River, geysers are so numerous that Hoch stetter counted seA7enty-six jets of steam or Avater from one point of vieAv, the principal fountain spouting every tAvo hours to a height of tAventy or thirty7 feet, the eruption lasting two minutes, and the basin refilling ten minutes after the eruption is over. In the \" Alum Cave \" there is a beautiful blue pool of Avarm water. Near Rotorua, which has near its centre a volcanic island, and is probably one of those crater lakes on Avhich Ave have had so much to say (pp. 132 \u2014 139), the Wakiti geyser, Avhich discharges through the centre of the usual cone built up of silicious deposits, is said to throAv a column of Avater to the height of eighty7 or one hundred feet. Ordinarily, it spouts every eight minutes, though its great eruptions are reserved for special occasions, regulated, it would seem, by the condition of the atmosphere or the direc tion of the Avind. Sometimes it Avill sud denly become active, and continue so for several Aveeks, each eruption excelling its \u2014 two, three, also some four and six feet high. They are formed by a number of semi circular stages, of Avhich no two are of the same height. Each of these stages has a small raised margin, from which slender stalac tites are hanging down upon the loAver stage, and Avhich encircles on its platform one or more basins resplendent Avith the most beau tiful blue Avater. These small water basins represent as many natural bathing-basins, Avhich the most refined luxury could not have prepared in a more splendid and commodious style. The basins can be chosen, shallow or deep, large or small, and of every variety of temperature, as the basins upon the higher stages, nearer to the main basin, contain warmer Avater than those upon the lower ones. Some of the basins are so large and so deep that one can easily7 sAvim in them. In ascending the steps, it is, of course, neces sary to Avade in the tepid Avater, Avhich spreads beside the lower basins upon the platforms of the stages, but rarely reaching above the ankle. During violent Avater-eruptions from the main basin steaming cascades may occur ; at ordinary times but very little water ripples over the terraces, and only7 the principal dis charge on the south side forms a hot, steam- * The Maori name for Leptospermvmi scoparium, the New Zealand \" tea-tree.\""], [220, "208 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. predecessor, and then just as suddenly sub siding.

This, hoAvever, Avas no extraordinary occurrence, for every noAv and then throughout this district a human being is SAvalloAyed up, or a child falls into a boiling spring. But even the Maoris had an idea that something uncommon was about to happen. A ghostly war canoe of the ancient type Avas reported to have been seen sailing up Tarawera, and new steam holes and pools appeared near the White Terraces, while others so rapidly increased in violence that the native guides began to lose themselves amid the constant change of the ground Avith Avhich they were so familiar. A little later Rotokakahi \u2014 a lake the water of Avhich had been always clear and cold \u2014 suddenly rose almost to boiling, throbbed convulsively, and assumed a disagreeable smell, as if sulphuretted hydrogen had been discharged into its waters. White Island, seventy miles distant, shoAved signs of redoubled activity; the sulphur miners had to leave it; clouds of red dust enveloped it ; stones Avere ejected a thousand feet into the air, and the sea birds, Avhich usually abound on its shores, Avere compelled to forsake them. Tongariro was several times in the spring of 1886 shrouded in smoke, though whether flames actually proceeded from its crater is not established, except by doubtful native testimony. The Avaters of Lake Taupo Avere not only affected by \"tidal Avaves,\" but various minor shocks of earthquakes were felt around its shores. There are several other geysers, but as they partake of much the same character, though of less moment from a scenic point of vieAv, it is unnecessary to describe them. Indeed, the Avhole hot lake district of New Zealand is riddled with geysers in their varieties of mud holes, boiling springs, solfataras, and fumaroles, and in places it is dangerous to tread the hot soil incautiously, lest the pedestrian be suddenly plunged into some seething mud hole, or other evidence of the all-abounding volcanic force beneath (Fig. 106) Dr. a7. Hoch stetter, the Austrian geologist Avho surveyed the district in 1863, as Ave have already said, Avarned the people of the country that some day the shell might give Avay, though even he considered the volcanoes of the region to have expended themselves, and to be rapidly reverting to the extinct condition of so many others in that part of the Avorld. In those clays, hoAvever, there Avas almost no one, except Maoris, in the Lake District. But of late years it had been a favourite tourist haunt, and, still later, a sanatorium had been es tablished for the benefit of those Avho Avished to avail themselves of the healing virtues of the hot baths. Certainly7 in June, 1886, little apprehension of any coming disaster was entertained. Tongariro is always uneasy, but there had been no eruption since July 6, 1871, Avhen flames and the noise of explosions issued from its crater ; Avhile Ruapehu, covered with a snow cap of dazzling Avhiteness, had never, so far as Maori tradition extends \u2014 and it reaches back for at least 1,000 years \u2014 been in actual eruption. But in 1881 it Avas noticed that the Avaters of TaraAA7era Lake became offensive, and for upAvards of a year continued unfit for use ; after Avhich they7 resumed their accustomed purity7. At Rotoiti, Rotoma, and Rotoehu lakes, distant sixteen miles from the principal point of the volcanic disturbance A\\-hich was impending, the Avater was dis turbed, and many neAv springs came into existence, Avhile others disappeared about the same period. One boiling spring burst up in the native church during service, and in the On the night of June 10-1 Ith, 1886, these premonitory symptoms ended in a catastrophe, the like of Avhich NeAv Zealand has not seen since the islands were settled by European colonists. The inhabitants Avere awakened by a \" horrible roar \" and the tumult of violent earthquakes. Simultaneously they beheld TaraAvera crowned with flames, after which came \" a deafening, continuous explosive roar, and another pillar of black cloud uprose enfolding the fiery pillar in dense darkness, only relieved by appallingly vivid flashes and"], [221, "Fig. 107.

There Avas no sign of lava. Indeed, the NeAv Zealand volcanoes, in recent times at least, have contented themselves Avith ejecting nothing more serious than ashes and mud. But there were evidences that the convulsion of Tarawera consisted not solely in a dis placement of the original constituents of the mountain, but in the ejection of rock in an incandescent condition. Scori\u00e6 and volcanic bombs Avere plentiful. The force of the eruption must have been enormous, for the volcanic explosions opened not simply two or three small craters, but forcibly \" expelled the Avhole centre of the massive three-peaked mountain or range for a length of two and a half miles to a depth varying from 400 feet to 1,400 feet,\" sheets of lightning, but of a blood-red tint, resulting from the intervening dust clouds.\" This was accompanied by a terrific thunder storm, and the sky Avas for hours lighted up by the lurid glare of lightning, Avhile the atmosphere was poisoned by a suffocating sulphurous stench, accompanied by heavy shoAvers of ashes, some of Avhich fell on the sea-board forty miles aAvay. Earthquake shocks, in the meantime, continued Avithout intermission. In the course of a feAV hours seventy distinct tremors Avere counted, and until noon of the 11th the darkness continued. Then, Avhen a gleam of light came, it was seen that the face of the country was covered with \" white or grey ash, and that hundreds of neAv boiling springs had burst out in every direc tion, some throwing up blue boiling mud, and many Avere actually along the roads, rendering all travel a matter of serious danger.\" Panic naturally seized many of the inhabitants. They fled, not knoAving in Avhat direction to take refuge. Nor was the terror moderated by the tidings Avhich gradually came dropping in. The flourishing settlement of Wairoa Avas destroyed and several bves Avere lost, man)7 houses being throAvn doAvn by the earthquakes, or overAvhelmed by the shoAvers of ashes and mud, Avhile others caught fire, and Avere con sumed in the confusion. Mokoia, the island in the centre of Lake Rotorua burst into an eruption of steam, and hideous mud and sulphur banks appeared at Tikitere on the shores of Rotoiti, which is separated from Rotorua by a narrow isthmus, Avhile tracts of country were covered Avith the pumice and ashes Avhich formed the first portion of the discharge from TaraAvera, or with the shoAvers of mud Avhich followed. The volcano itself was rent by two huge fissures, into one of which the drainage of the mountain has emptied, forming a new lake, absorbing and extending the little Lake Rotomakariri, Avhile another little green-coloured lake filled a crater 75 yards in diameter. The borders of the fissures were coloured with ferrochlorides, and from the bottom of the great gorge, 200 yards in width, and 250 feet, formed in a single day, steam fumes of hydrochloric acid, ar.d occa- Rotomahana had almost disappeared. The bed of the lake is iioav 500 feet beloAv the old level, and is considerably lower than Tara wera, into which its surplus water formerly floAved. Indeed, with the exception of about an area 750 feet by 300 feet still covered with Avater, Rotomahana is now entirely com posed of steam holes, several of them 150 feet across, and mud volcanoes, one or two of them 600 feet high and 300 feet across, belching forth mud and stones to a height of 100 feet or more. New geyser craters have broken out all around the lake, some of which, during the preliminary eruption to which they owe their existence, discharged blocks of stone fully 100 tons in Aveight. * But to the sightseer the most lamentable result of the dismal Avork done on that fatal 10th of June was the destruction of the White and Pink Terraces.

An artist Avas so eager to obtain a sketch of the scene that he narroAvly escaped adding one more to the list of victims ; for, a moment after he had left the brink, the whole ground where he had stood slid doAvn bodily into the crater. The roaring of the steam rising from the chasm betAveen the Pink and White Terraces was appalling, and the sulphurous stench suffocating. Every noAv and then a more deafening booming ac companied a violent explosion, shooting up liquid mud. One such shower, starting from a base about tAvo hundred y7ards long, Avas shot up perpendicularly to a height of several hun dred feet, falling in seven separate tapering columns.\" the banks of the lake are so perforated with springs that every native hut has its own natural boiler, Avhich is used as a kitchen. The Kuirua spring is strongly alkaline, and, on account of its saponaceous qualities, is utilised as a general wash-tub. In Iceland to cook food in the geysers is a regular portion of the tourist programme. Tea is infused Avith Avater from the Great Geyser, and trout are boiled in the Blesi, or hot water pond, Avhich suddenly ceased to erupt after the Skaptar-JokuU convulsion of 1784. They require to be immersed for about tAventy minutes to be cooked to a turn. In the YelloAvstone country a story is told of a fisherman, Avho having hooked a fine trout, merely turned on his heel and, Avithout taking his captiVe off the line, plunged it into a pool of hot Avater, from Avhich in a short time he dreAv it ready for his meal, reminding us of Lord Lovat, the Jacobite rebel, Avho, Avhen lun cheon time approached, betook himself to a fall on his estate famous for its leaping salmon, and placed a caldron of boiling Avater in such a position that a fish missing its spring would tumble into the pot. Neither story may be true, though there is nothing improbable in either. M. Leclercq narrates how two Irishmen tried to cook their dinner at the Strokr, in Iceland. A shoulder of mutton Avas Avrapped in the body of a flannel shirt, and in each sleeve a plover Avas placed, and the load dropped into the geyser. After Avaiting for half an hour the shirt (Avith its contents) Avas hurled up high into the air, and landed on the brink of the basin. The mutton Avas \" cooked as in Eng land \" \u2014 the French Avriter discreetly observes. But nothing was left of the birds except skin and bones ; all colour had fled from the shirt, though the fabric remained uninjured. The hot Avater basins both in the YelloAvstone country and in New Zealand are in great demand as bathing -places. Towards the close of the fourteenth century Nicolo Zeno saAv Icelandic monks heating their rooms with the thermal springs in Julianeshaab District, in South Greenland. To make a Avashing-tub of a crater is to utilise the forces of Nature to the utmost limits of prosaicism. Serious as was the loss of life, it might easily have been more. A rash speculator had actually made all arrangements for building a hotel on the brink of the Pink Terrace. The licence Avas taken, and the ground for the site prepared. Had the eruption been de layed \u2014 or the building been expedited \u2014 by a feAV months the hotel would have been croAvded with travellers. In the YelloAvstone country a large hotel is erected upon a great geyser terrace, and a dormant water-crater is the re ceptacle for all the house drainage ; and in the same romantic region the Chinese laundry man attached to one of the hotels gets through his labours by throwing the clothes into a bubbling, frothy pool, and fishing them out when they have been tossed about enough.

Indeed, it may be asserted in general terms that the discharge by Avhich the Pink and White Terraces Avere destroyed was really a geyser eruption on a large and complicated scale. Maori stronghold was submerged in Lake Rotorua, which about that neriod had com menced boiling. \" The posts and part of the carved wood of the old pah [stockaded post] still lie on the brink of the lake, no one venturing to touch Avhat is esteemed a sacred ruin. It remains as a solemn Avarning to the settlers in the neAv city of Rotorua that Avhat has once occurred may happen again. Meanwhile, the dead are laid to rest beneath the green turf beside these posts, which is constantly veiled by the steam of innumerable boiling springs.\" * The cause of this sudden outburst is not very far to seek. NeAv Zealand is a land of dying volcanic action. The volcanoes are getting into the solfatara stage, Avhich, though geologically of much less importance than the lava period, can be sufficiently uncomfortable for those concerned. Even the old lion, toothless and decrepit, can, Avhen roused, show something of its native strength. In the course of ages the endless boiling springs have dissolved all the materials beneath the crust, until it is in places quite cavernous. This was the opinion of Hochstetter in 1859. Some day, this geologist prophesied, \" the whole of the mountain, up to the Te Kopiha fountain, being, as it seems, thoroughly de composed by hot vapours, wdl cause a sudden catastrophe by falling in and covering the Rotoreka Plain Avith a flood of hot mud.\" The eruption Avhich created such havoc in June, 1886, was, therefore, due to the enor mous accumulation of superheated steam from the water supplying the geysers and boiling springs beneath the cavernous crust, expanding and sending the sodden soil over head into the air in the shape of an erup tion of mud. This theory is in accordance with all the facts so far as yet ascertained, and is stated as follows by Sir James Hector, Director of the Geological Survey : \u2014 \" The TaraAvera mountain, which was for merly a volcano, had been for ages heavily capped with obsidian, forming, as it were, an enormous glass dome hermetically sealing it. The pent forces have now blown this dome away. The tremendous explosion has shattered the tubes, or the piping of the Pink and White Terraces, which probably led thousands of feet into the superheated regions of the earth. This let doAvn the Avhole of Lake Rotomahana, Mishaps of this character were not unknown in the history of New Zealand previous to the year 1886. In 1846 Mount Kakaremea, sod dened by the constant steaming Avhich it had received from the numerous hot springs in its vicinity, fell in an avalanche of scald ing mud, overwhelming the Maori village of Te Rapa, and SAvalloAving up its inhabitants.

What Avas for merly the lake is noAv occupied by numer ous mud volcanoes (Fig. 103). If this vol canic activity continues unabated, the dis trict Avill, perhaps, afford in the future greater attractions to the tourist than even the vanished terraces, Avith all their match less beauty.\" Cause of Geysers. It is clear from the data supplied in the preceding pages that steam is the propelling agent of the water Avhich is shot out of geysers. Of this there is no doubt. But Avhen AA7e come to speculate as to the source Avhence this steam is derived, Ave are face to face Avith a difficulty almost identical Avith that Avhich met us when the origin of the lava and the agent AA-hich ejected volcanic products Avere considered. In the meantime, in the district about Lake Okaro, range beyond range of smooth hills is streAvn Avith finely-poAvdered dust Avhich has been discharged directly7 from the regions of central fire ; Avhile the opposite direction, near Wairoa and Rotorua \u2014 a tract twenty mdes by tAvelve \u2014 is for the most part smothered beneath the grey mud, believed to have been discharged from Lake Rotomahana. At present this mud has hardened bke cement. But in time it Avill crumble doAvn under the action of the weather, and, like most volcanic soils, will become more productive than the old earth which it has overlaid (p. 16) \u2014 especially as this Avas for the most part of a light pumice character, and almost valueless for agricultural or pastoral purposes. Alto gether it has been estimated that more than 100 million tons of volcanic dust, pul verised scori\u00e6, or mud, have been spread very unequally over about one hundred square miles of country7.

Cavern Theories. \u2014 Sir George Mackenzie's theory7 Avas for many years the most generally accepted one, and e\\7en yet forms the basis of several others formulated to overcome some of the difficulties AA7hich it presented. He inferred (Fig. 108) that the gey7ser pipe corn- Fig. 108. \u2014 DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING MACKENZIE'S THEORY OF GETSER ERUPTIONS.

Then being heated by Avarmth conducted through the strata from the rocks beloAA7, or by steam percolating into it from cracks in the bottom, it Avill soon be partially filled Avith boiling con tents. The steam generated will be sufficient to sustain the column of water in the tube. But if, by a sudden addition of heat, a quantity of steam is produced in starts, the expansive force will be so great that the water will 0A7er flow into the crater, at the top of the gey7ser cone.

With a tube, the long arm of which measured two feet, and the bore of Avhich Avas three eighths of an inch, he sent a jet to the height of eighteen feet. Steam is generated in the short arm, and presses doAvn the water, causing an overflow, until the steam-bubble turns the angle, Avhen it forces out the column in the long arm Avith incredible violence.\" HoAvever, though no doubt this apparatus is in some respects an approximation to the one em ployed by Nature, experiments Avith it do not altogether confirm this ingenious Avriter's conclusion that Avhat happens is really analogous to a geyser eruption. be forced into the pipe, and the steam will rush through it Avith great violence, and an eruption Avill take place. Mackenzie regarded the shaking of the ground and the noises like the discharge of artillery which usually pre cede an eruption, as due to the evolution of steam in starts, due to this sudden accession of heat. Or if the Avater did not escape in the manner described, the steam \" escaping round the neck of the cavern by pushing the water before it, Avould condense in the cooler Avater of the tube, and thus cause merely a rising and falling of the Avater Avithin the basin above,\"* as is seen in many geysers (pp. 192, 194). Mackenzie's theory, hoAvever, while it takes cognisance of the action of the Little Geyser, does not explain the eruption of the Great Geyser, in Iceland, and does not account for the frequent and periodical production of the phenomena. But his merit is in having recog nised the fact that sudden evolution of heat is the proximate cause of the eruption, and that to heat and the laAvs regulating its action we must in future confine our inquiries. Tube Theory.\u2014 The theories noticed \u2014 and they are only a few out of many formulated \u2014 demand the admittance of a hypothetical sub terranean cavity. But the explanation offered by Bunsen t claims to dispense Avith any such fountain-head of eruptive force. From obser vations made on the Great Geyser of Iceland, he concluded that its various eruptions were due to circumstances depending upon the different rates at Avhich Avater boils at dif ferent depths. We know, for instance, that at the level of the sea it boils at 212\u00b0 Fahr, and, the higher one ascends, the degree at Avhich it boils is loAver ; Avhile if Ave descend below the level of the sea \u2014 into the Jordan Yalley, or into a mine, for example \u2014 the Avater Avill take proportionately long to attain the boiling-point. Hence, heights are conve niently measured by noting the exact tem perature at Avhich water boils at various elevations. These variations in the boiling point are due to the influence of the pressure of the column of air overhead, this pressure being, of course, less at high elevations, and greater at lower ones. At the bottom of a deep pipe of water, it Avill necessarily 1'oUoav that the pressure Avould be even greater than in the atmosphere, the entire superincumbent column of liquid keeping the water at the bottom of Bischof and Von Nidda formulated a theory almost exactlythe same, and explained theerup tions ofthe Great Geyser and Strokhr by taking for granted that a smaller cavity fills quicker, and therefore empties itself more frequently, Avhde a larger cavity fills slower, and empties itself seldomer, but Avith greater violence. Comstock also adopts the idea of the fountain head of a geyser being a cavern contain ing Avater ; but he tries to account for in termittent geyser action by supposing that after the tube leaves the first cavity it bends and forms a second one, from which the tube through Avhich the discharge takes place rises to the surface. Baring-Gould also adopted Mackenzie's theory. \" He took an iron tube,\" Dr. Peale tells us in his synopsis of geyser doctrines, \" and bent it at an angle of 110\u00b0, keeping one arm half the length of the other. He filled the tube with Avater, and placed the short arm in the fire. For a moment the surface of the liquid remained quiet, and then the pipe began to quiver; a t He was assisted by Descloizeaux, and their conclusions have been largely confirmed by Miiller of Freiburg, Wiede mann, Rryson, Douay, Tyndall, and Walker. * Darrett on \" Geysers \" in Science for All, Vol. I., pp. 225\u2014227."], [227, "TUBE THEORY OF GEYSERS. 215 the tube from attaining the boiling-point, until it is far over 212\u00b0, Avhile the water at a point considerably nearer the surface Avould be in a condition of steam from the heat derived from the water loAver doAvn. These Avell-knoAvn principles of physics \u2014 stated here in only the merest outline* \u2014 lie at the base of Bunsen's theory. In the Great Geyser of Iceland the geyser tube is a vertical pipe (Fig. 109). After each eruption the level of the Avater is about three to six feet doAvn in the pipe (say about the line a in Fig. 109), and rises sloAvly from this level until it overfloAvs. But it does not on the surface (p. 194). Observation has also shoAvn not only that the temperature of the column of water decreases from below up wards (that is, it is always hotter lower down than farther up), but also that betAveen one eruption and the next one the temperature is constantly rising at every point, so that whilp, for example, at a depth of from nineteen to tAventy-two feet the temperature after an eruption is 194\u00b0, an hour later it is close on 196\u00b0 ; and, lastly, that during the Avhole time betAveen the tAvo eruptions the temperature of any point of the Avater column is loAver than the boiling-point corresponding to the pressure on this point. In the middle of the geyser pipe the temperature comes nearest to the boiling point. At the bottom the temperature is higher than the ordinary boiling-point of Avater, but the Avater is prevented from boiling by the pressure of the Avater column above it. When, through the constant rise of the temperature caused by the overheated Avater steaming upAvards, the boiling-point corres ponding to the height of the pressure in the central region is reached, a layer of water will immediately7 transform itself into steam, and cause an upheaval of the surface. HoAvever, the next layer above it Avill also be affected, and transformed into steam, and so force up a larger or smaller amount of the lower part of the water column, until the upper portion of the column is projected with great force into the air.

Part of it is cooled at the edge of the basin (Fig. 109, b b), and returns along the side of the pipe to the bottom, Avhere it is again heated, and lifted up again by the cur rent Avhich the ascending steam forms in the middle. If we throAv bits of paper into the Avater after an eruption, Ave are able to satisfy ourselves regarding these currents of the water Here it becomes cooled, and falling back into the basin temporarily checks the formation of steam, until enough water of a very high temperature has risen to again raise the superincumbent portion to the boiling-point, Avhen the eruption begins de novo. This lasts just as long as the conditions described are in force. When the cooled w-ater, falling again into the basin, restores the equilibrium doAvn below, and the hot Avater from the bottom of the tube has not poAver to heat the super incumbent layer sufficiently to form the ejecting steam, the eruption ceases. During an eruption a great deal of water falls outside the crater. This is the reason Avhy the level * The reader may again be referred to Professor Barrett's admirable paper for a full exposition of these doctrines, though probably Bunsen's theory is accepted there with too few reservations, recent observations throwing some doubt on the conclusion that it is applicable to every geyser. f Iu the text of this work the temperatures, when the contrary is not stated, are all given in degrees Fahrenheit. But the English-speaking peoples and the Russians are almost alone iu using this scale, the Centigrade (or Celsius) or Reaumur being used by other nations.

The length of the period of quiescence is, of course, dependent upon the quantity and the temperature of the water from beloAv, and also on the depth and1 width of the pipe. It must also be to some extent influenced by the AA7eather, Avhether it is Avet or dry, since the Avater, AA7hich is the chief factor in a geyser display, must necessarily be derived from the atmosphere, and find its w7ay into the tube either from above or from below as in Figs. 108, 109, or possibly from both quarters. On this account the interval betAveen tAvo eruptions differs not only in different geysers, but also in the same foun tains at different times. Most of our data regarding the conditions Avhich prevail in the tube are necessarily inferential. Still, it is tolerably certain that the lower strata of water are not disturbed by an eruption. Bunsen hung stones by strings to the pipe, and found that only those in the higher levels were ejected by the rush of water, while those at or near the bottom were undisturbed, and a thermometer sunk at the bottom of the geyser remained quiet and unbroken during an eruption. same or on different levels, but hard by, are perfectly placid. This prov7es to demonstra tion that these geysers at least do not all proceed from the same reservoir, though, at the same time, the facts mentioned do not quite preclude the acceptance of the old idea of a subterranean reservoir being the fountain head of a geyser, as originally suggested by Mac kenzie. Indeed, the phenomena presented by some geysers \u2014 especially those in the YelloAv stone country \u2014 are better explained by some modification of the \"cavern theory\" than by that of Bunsen, Avhich is framed solely upon obser vations made on the Great Geyser of Iceland. The difference betAveen the two theories lies in this. Suppose a tube filled with water, and heated rapidly at the bottom ; the water will, Avhen the boiling-point is reached, be violently expelled from the top. This, in part at least, is a simple illustration of Bunsen's theory. But if the Avater is put in a tea-kettle and boiled into steam, then either the hd will be bloAvn off, or the steam, with or without Avater, will escape through the spout. This is an exemplification of the theory which presup poses a subterranean cavern, with an opening to the surface. But the gulf betAveen the two theories is not so broad as might be supposed from this crude statement of their elements. Both admit steam to be the agent which ex pels the geyser column, and both presuppose that at a certain depth in the earth the rocks must be so warm that the heat imparted by them can boil the water \u2014 be it in cavern or Difficxdties in Geyser Theories. \u2014 None of these theories, however, explain quite satis factorily all the phenomena of every class of geyser, though, possibly, Bunsen's is on the whole the one which is most generally ac cepted. The variations noticed in different geysers may depend on variations of the form of the tube, or subterranean Avater passages, even should we be content to dismiss the idea of subterranean cavities. Gey7sers close to gether have evidently no connection with each other, otherwise the level of the Avater in their pipes and basins would not be different ; while if they were impelled by the same motive power it is certain that they Avould be more sympathetic in their action, instead of being capricious in the extreme, two geysers within a few feet of each other having' eruptions of Avidely different duration and interval. Indeed, it is quite common to see a geyser in the Yellowstone country in violent eruption, while the caldrons of others on the in closed tube \u2014 so as to generate the requisite amount of steam demanded for the expulsion of the water. Or, if not, then the water must be heated by steam, which penetrates the tube or the cavern from quarters where there is heat enough to generate this vaporous form of water. Where the heat comes from is immaterial; the main point is, that it must be there. In the Great Geyser, it is believed, from some observations made, that it does actually enter at the side at a depth of about forty-five feet in the tube ; and in the Strokhr there are openings on opposite sides of its tube through which, when the tube is empty, water and steam can be seen"], [229, "Fig. 110. -THE GRAND GEYSER OF THE YELLOAA'STONE PARK."], [230, "218 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. pouring. This steam must come from some other region, and in all likelihood is evolved in caverns. That such must exist is rendered probable from the Avay in Avhich geysers are first formed, namely, by violent outbursts of steam and Avater, conditions Avhich render \" irregular cavities and passages \" more \"likely to be formed than regular tubes, Avhich are a subsequent groAvth from the deposition of silica deposits around the opening through which the column of steam and water is dis charged by the geyser.\" periods, as in the third class : but these are folloAved by a marked steam period. Various irregularities in the shape of the geyser tube may be regarded as the principal factor in causing the peculiarities described, though the methods in Avhich the heat is supplied to the tube, or to the cavern \u2014 since both may exist in various combinations \u2014 is certain to have an even greater influence. The effect of the atmosphere on geysers has long been noticed (pp. 206, 207). One of the NeAv Zealand spouting springs Avas knoAvn to the Maoris as \" Tapui,\" the wind-pointer, from the fact that it only discharged Avhen there Avere north and east Avinds. Again, the springs at AVhakareAvareAva are most active Avhen the Avind is in the south-Avest and Avest ; Avhile that behind Te Tarata used to recede from its basin Avhen the south Avind bleAv. Others Avere quiescent during certain months in the year, facts Avhich are interesting Avhen Ave compare them Avith the ideas of the people of Strom boli regarding the eruptions being most fre quent during certain directions of the wind (p. 144), or the better-ascertained fact that the paroxysms are most violent during the Avinter* How the weather influences these eruptions Ave cannot say. No doubt, however, the supply of Avater, Avhich must, of course, proceed from the surface, has its effect on the greater or smaller amount of discharge, or upon the greater or less frequency of the eruptions. The source of the heat Avhich boils the Avater into steam, or warms hot springs generally need not be discussed after Avhat has already been said regarding the origin of volcanic action (pp. 179 \u2014 182)., Both must be identical in origin. Dr. Peale, who suggests this very reason able explanation, is therefore inclined to regard Bunsen's theory as a mere modifica tion and expansion of Mackenzie's, and at best explanatory of only a part of gey7ser phenomena, since it seems to require sub terranean cavities in Avhich the Avater must be heated. Whether these are caverns, en largement of tubes, or tributary channels, is of the smallest importance, except in so far as the interval betAveen tAvo eruptions might be affected by the form of the reservoir holding the Avater. These variations may be affected by- the size or shape of the geyser tubes, and many other circumstances at the nature of which Ave can only guess. In Iceland the geysers are much simpler than those in the YelloAv stone country and in NeAv Zealand. In the YelloAvstone Park there are, according to Dr. Peale, four classes of spouting springs, if they are grouped according to the characteristics of their eruptions, but Avithout regard to the length of their intervals. (1), There are those in Avhich, like Old Faithful and the Beehive, the action is confined to one eruption, and is not followed by a marked steam period. (2), Those, like the Castle, in Avhich the eruption consists of a single water period, but folloAved by a marked steam period of considerable length. (3), Those' Avhich have several water eruptions, separated by an interval of several minutes or hours, Avhile the regular interval is from a day to several Aveeks ; the Grand (Fig. 110) and the Giantess are examples of this kind. (4), The Giant and the Union are types of geysers in which there are Avater A geyser is, in truth, only another form of volcano \u2014 one which discharges water instead of ashes and lava. Both depend on Avater for their active phenomena ; in both there is a periodicity, though the volcano requires as many years as the geyser demands hours for the reneAval of its expended force ; and though the volcano may rive for more cen turies than the geyser years, both alike have * Mair : Transactions of the New Zealand Institute, Vol. IX.. pp. 22\u201429."], [231, "UNINTERMITTENT HOT SPRINGS. 219 their limit of duration. They gradually de cline, and then, after a feeble old age, become extinct, the geyser in its various forms being mainly found in regions Avhere volcanic ac tion is dead or dormant, so that the Avater volcano may \u2014 like the gas-volcano \u2014 be regarded as the expiring effort of the sub terranean giant. Minor, knoAvn to the Turks as Panbouk Kalessi, or the \" Cotton Castle.\" Mr. Abram describes this terrace Avhen viewed from the opposite mountains, some twenty miles aAA7ay, as looking like a breastplate of silver on a giant's body.

On the high plateau from whence these springs descend are the ruins of a temple, once appropriately dedicated to Pluto. The holy hot bath Avhich stood in the temple courtyard, surrounded by a colonnade, is still in fine preservation, and beneath its deep clear blue Avaters can be seen many a fluted column and finely-carved cor nice. Sulphurous gas is continually bubbling up from the bottom of the bath. The chief source of the springs is a cave \u2014 the ancient Plutoneum \u2014 from Avhich issues a gas described as \" fatal to animal life.\" This is most pro bably carbonic acid.

Unintermittent Hot Springs.\u2014 A true geyser\u2014 that is, one dependent on steam for its motive poAver \u2014 -must necessarily discharge hot water. But the finest features of the geyser districts we have described are not necessarily due to intermittent springs, but to the silicious, or calcareous, deposits from those which floAv out of the ground more or less unintermittently, though the origin of the tAvo is unquestionably the same. They must both derive their heat from some deep subterranean source, though rocks have such different conducting poAver that it is idle, from a consideration of the rate at Avhich temperature increases as Ave descend into the earth, to calculate the depth at Avhich the temperature of any particular spring must have been attained. It is enough for us to knoAv that Avhen we see \u2014 as we frequently do \u2014 tAvo springs floAving side by side, the one cold and the other Avarm, the first must come from a considerable depth, Avhile the other is more of surface origin. Nor, though volcanic districts are most markedly7 distinguished by the presence of hot springs, does it necessarily folloAv that they are confined to such regions. Those of Bath and Buxton, in England, for example, are in a part of the Avorld far re moved from any active volcanoes. In their course through the earth they dissolve out of the rocks the various soluble materials Avith Avhich they come in contact. The chief sub stances thus held in solution Avhen they come to the surface are silica and carbonate of lime. To the deposition of the silica, when the Avater evaporated, Avere due the famous Pink and White Terraces ; but the almost equally remarkable terraces, at the Mammoth Hot Springs (Fig. 101), are composed of calcareous material. The same kind of terrace may be seen near the ruins of Hierapolis, in Asia Other materials beside silica and lime enter into the'se hot springs ; indeed, almost any soluble substance may be taken up. In Iceland, for example, there is much copper, and in NeAv Zealand common salt, dissolved in the geyser and other hot springs. The amount of solid matter deposited from them is shoAvn by the vast heaps of silicious and calcareous matter Avhich have been piled around the crater of geysers and along the course of hot springs. The springs of Huanca velica, in Peru, have deposited so much stony material that, like travertine (p. 66), it is quarried for building purposes. The hot springs of Carlsbad have deposited pisolite (Strudelstein) in masses sufficiently large to fill up the Avhole bottom of the valley, and upon these deposits the toAvn itself is mainly built ; and it has been calculated that if the deposits from the hot springs at Bath Avere"], [232, "OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. 220 rates, the rate of deposition may depend on a variety of circumstances. Much less, is it safe to reckon the age of any deposit from ob servations made on another only a short dis tance aAvay. Springs laden Avith calcareous matter part with it simply by cooling and losing carbonic acid, while the silicious Avaters, so far as we at present knoAv, deposit the silica or geyserite on evaporation, \" as it Aoavs from the springs or falls from the geyser,\" though Avhere there is a superfluity of silica some may be precipitated Avhen the Avater cools. collected, it Avould be found that in 2,000 years they would form a solid cone equal in height to Monte Nuovo, in Italy;* and Strabo, speaking of the springs of Hierapolis, declares that Avhen the people of the city wanted a Avail, they simply conducted the lime-laden waters into ditches : then the de posit formed a solid dyke! These examples are altogether taken from calcareous deposits, tufa, or travertine, OAving to the greater ease Avith which it is devolved out and laid doAvn, accumulating much faster than silica sinter. Under favourable circumstances about one sixteenth of an inch of calcareous matter is deposited by the Mammoth Hot Springs Birth and Death of Geysers. \u2014 BetAveen a geyser and an ordinary hot spring \u2014 in other words, betAveen an intermittent and a non- Fig. 111. \u2014 SECTION THROUGH THE CRATER AND THE SINTER TERRACE OP TE TARATA (THE WHITE TERRACE), OF NEW ZEALAND, BEFORE ITS DESTRUCTION IN 1886. a a, The crater os the geyser ; bbb, The basins on the terrace ; c, The surface of Rotomahana ; d, the accumulations of silicious sinter ot geyserite ; e c, Underlying rock of Rhyolite (liparite, or quartz-trachyte). intermittent one \u2014 the difference is one of de gree rather than of kind. Between the two there is every gradation, and the one may turn into the other, or vice versa. If Bunsen's theory is Avell founded, a hot spring forming a tube Avill in time become a geyser, and by still further raising this tube, make the pressure of the contained column of Avater so great that it Avill cease to Avork. A spring, let us suppose, flows hot out of the ground, and then, Avhen its waters dry up, leaves a deposit of silica or tufa behind. This in time forms an embank ment around the opening of the spring, Avhich by-and-by grows into a basin from which a tube leads the Avater to the surface. \" But if the tube groAvs higher and higher, and the column of Avater Avithin deeper, and the pressure beloAv greater, a more exalted in four days, while it takes fully tAventy four hours for the Great Geyser in Iceland to leave behind it a layer equal to the thickness of a very thin sheet of paper, and so sloAvly was the silica deposited by the springs form ing the Pink Terrace, in NeAv Zealand, that the names of tourists, Avritten in pencil thirty years before, could easily7 be read through the thin film Avhich had in the interval covered the pencil marks. On the other hand, Avhat ever lay upon the Te Tarata terrace became encrusted in a short time (Fig. 111). It is, therefore, impossible to calculate Avith much approach to accuracy the age of any geyser or hot spring deposit, from the thickness of the material Avhich it lays doAvn ; for as the mate rial is deposited only Avhen the water evapo- * Judd : \" Volcanoes,\" pp. 184, 219."], [233, "LIFE HISTORY OF GEYSERS. 221 temperature is necessary to reach the boiling point, and hence longer and more uncertain periods should intervene betAveen each erup tion. At length, if the previous accretion be continued, Ave should expect to find an eruption at rare intervals ; and ultimately the great depth of the column of water would create so enormous a pressure, that the temperature of the boiling-point Avould never be reached by the source of heat beloAv, and the geyser Avould then cease to erupt at all.\" country. In Iceland Ave have seen that the Strokhr Avas before 1789 an inconsiderable spring, and that the \" Soaring Geyser \" of that date has noAv become a quiet spring (p. 195),, and in the neighbourhood of still actiA-e fountains may frequently be seen mounds of silica, on the top of Avhich are quiet pools or \"laugs\" of great depth, which bear every appearance of having been extinct geysers. The pipe still communicates Avith the sub terranean Avorld, but no motion is ever seen in the crater ; Avhile in other places a further stage of decadence is displayed in craters noAv altogether dry, and the pipe, Avhich at one time Avas the outlet for spouting columns, altogether choked up Avith stones and other rubbish. In the YelloAvstone country geysers have come into life since it Avas first explored (p. 196). This concise theoretical statement of Pro fessor Barrett is confirmed by actual facts. In the earliest accounts of Iceland \u2014 Avhich extend back for 1,000 years, and are so cir cumstantial on less important matters that it is almost certain the historians Avould not omit to mention phenomena so remarkable as spouting springs \u2014 there is no mention what ever of the geysers. But as Saxo Gram maticus notices the Great Geyser in his history of Denmark, written toAvards the close of the thirteenth century, it must have been known before that date. Possibly, the volcanic eruption of 1294 caused the dis appearance of many thermal springs, and produced those now existing. Tavo hundred and fifty years ago, the Geyser spouted regularly once in twenty-four hours. In 1770 its eruption had increased to eleven times a day; by 1814 it erupted only once every six hours ; in 1872, once or twice a Aveek ; and noAvadays travellers Avill sometimes Avait a week, and even a fortnight, before the Avaning geyser can recover sufficient force to play. Thus a geyser begins by being a hot spring ; by-and-by it becomes a geyser ; then, as it destroys its poAver by its oavii energy in de positing silica, or AvhateA-er other material its Avaters may hold in solution, it sinks into the: condition of a \" laug,\" Avhich for a Avhile steams occasionally, until in time even this last remnant of former greatness deserts it, and the geyser can be traced only by its. round shaft and sepulchral mound* The converse of this destruction of geyser action by relieving the superincumbent pressure to some extent Avas exemplified in an experiment by Mr. Baring-Gould, which is Avorthy of mention. \" We raised,\" he tells us, \" the depth of the Avell south of the blue ponds tAventy feet, by turning the stream from these ponds into it, and completely altered its character, converting it from a Avell of furiously boiling Avater to a pool steaming tranquilly. Not satisfied with this experi ment, Ave tried another, and dug into a small puddle of hot mud. It Avas at once converted into a bubbling pool of five jets.\" The height of the column discharged seems also to have decreased in the same ratio, thus confirming the theory that as the tube groAvs higher by accretions round its mouth, and the column of Avater within deeper, and the pressure below greater, a higher tempera ture is necessary to reach the boiling-point. Hence, also, \"longer and more uncertain periods should intervene between each erup tion,\" until, if this process of deepening goes on, the geyser Avill in time \" cease to erupt at all.\" Indeed, this rise and decline of geysers are a common observation in any geyser * Forbes : \" Iceland : Its Volcanoes, Geysers, and Glaciers\" (1860); Eurton : \"Ultima Thule \" (1S7.V) ; Pajkull : \" A Summer in Iceland \" (1868) ; Coles : ''Summer Travelling in Iceland\" (1S82) ; etc. A full bibliography of geysers and other thermal springs is given by Peale."], [234, "222 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. Avarning; and the steam is so dense and the sulphurous fumes so suffocating that one becomes beAvildered and can hardly pick one's Avay among them.\"* This graphic de scription applies with equal aptitude to the mud springs of similar origin elseAvhore. In the YelloAvstone country the mud is in some pits as stiff' as mortar, in others it is like paint, the thickness or thinness of their con tents being greatly influenced by the wetness or dryness of the season. They are also of all colours \u2014 red, white, lavender, grey, or blue \u2014 and nearly all give off the evil-smelling gas knoAvn as sulphuretted hydrogen. Sometimes in pools, Avhen the mud is more than usually stiff and the steam meets Avith unusual resist ance, the liquid mud oozing up from beloAv through the neAvly -formed vents forms regular cones sometimes a foot or more in height, and occasionally Avith crater-like openings on their summits. Such cones are often seen in NeAv Zealand and the YelloAvstone Park, and in Southern California there are from three to fifteen such cones in a space 500 by 350 yards \u2014 some sharp, some dome-shaped. Steam rushes constantly from many, and is inter mittent in some. One throws a stream of Avater from fifteen to thirty feet into the air.t Again, in North- Western Nevada, near Granite Creek Station, there are mud springs \u2014 as they ought properly to be called, unless, indeed, mud Avells would not be more appropriate \u2014 the contents of Avhich are thrown up and violently agitated at regular intervals, accompanied by puff's of steam, Avhich sIioav a close approximation to geyser action. Several of these springs have built up cones of hardened mud, all Avith one exception closed at the top. In this one the aperture emits sulphuretted hydrogen, and occasionally throAvs out mud and water in all directions.\"]: In Sumatra there is something even more pronounced, though of exactly the same character (p. 202). The \" Mud Geyser\" of Hayden's Valley, in the Yellowstone Park, Mud Volcanoes. These must be carefully distinguished from true volcanoes, Avhich at the beginning of their outbreak discharge copious floods of mud (p. 138). In reality, the phenomena Avhich form the subject of this paragraph are not volcanoes at all, but are more nearly akin to, if not in some respects identical Avith, those of geysers. Even then, one and perhaps the most common form of \" mud volcanoes,\" so called, are actually only boiling mud wells, caused by the steam con tinually ascending through the porous soil, so soddening it at places that the crust falls in and the spot becomes a pit or pond Avhere the re sultant mud is continually seething. This form of \" mud volcano \" is common in most volcanic or geyser districts. In NeAv Zealand, Ave haA7e seen, it exists almost everyAvhere ; and both in Iceland and theYelloAvstone, among other localities, excellent examples of these mud holes may7 be found both in an active and an extinct condition. The holes are only vents in what is probably a great caldron of mud beloAv, covered Avith a thin crust, through Avhich, at spots like these, the imprisoned steam has burst. The consistence of this mud varies from that of thick treacle to a liquid Avhich is simply ink-black Avater. \" The thundering and throbbing of these boilers,\" a visitor to those of Iceland has remarked, \" the thud-thud of the hot Avaves chafing their barriers, the hissing and spluttering of the smaller fumaroles, ' the plop-plop ' of the little mud pools, and above all the scream of a steam-Avhistle at the edge of a blue slime pool, produce an effect truly horrible. In some of the caldrons the mud is boiling furiously, sending sundry squirts into the air ; in others, balls of black tilth rise and explode into scalding sprinklings ; in one a foaming curd forms on the fluid, and the whole mass palpitates gently for a moment, then throbs violently, surges up the Avell, and bursts into a frenzied, roaring pool of slush, squirting, reeling, Avhirling in paroxysms against the crumbling sides, Avhich melt like butter before its fury. One or tAvo of the springs have heaped themselves mounds around their orifices ; others gape in the surface Avithout * Baring-Gould: \"Iceland,\" p. 141. f Veatch : Proceedings of the Californian Academy us Sciences, 1857, p. 104.

There is thus every gradation betAveen the clear and the muddy well, just as there is between the un intermittent and the intermittent springs. After a time a mud hole may get choked by the \" cavins in \" of its banks. Then the steam or the hot spray, Avhich Avorks the earth up into mud, Avill seek an easier outlet, and the once seething mud hole Avill remain a dead pit among its still active kindred. ones. If washed away by7 rain, the soil is spread out on the neighbouring country. But by-and-by the tiny eruptions begin afresh, and the hillocks form either there or in some other spot in the vicinity of the old vents. When naphtha or petroleum enters into the composition of such mud volcanoes they are knoAvn as Salinellas. The macalubas of Sicily \u2014 so called from Macaluba, near Girgenti, Avhere numbers of them are found \u2014 throAV out mud and bituminous matter. Dr. Daubeny attributed their activity to the combustion of beds of sulphur, in that quarter associated Avith the blue clays, amid Avhich these mud eruptions take place. The gases given off consist of carbonic acid and carburetted hy7drogen,Avhich, Avhen the macaluba is at rest, bubble up through the mud and bitumen, Avhich is usually at a temperature of from 68\u00b0 to 72\u00b0. The Salinellas of Paterno, at the foot of Etna, which have a temperature of from 55A-\u00b0 to 98.\u00a3\u00b0, and the mud volcanoes of the shores of the Caspian, Avhich shoAv a temperature of from 89\u00b0 to 98\u00a3\u00b0, are of much the same nature. We see an apt specimen of these salses in the Arsena of the Caspian region \u2014 a hill 984 feet high, Avith an elliptical crater less than two-thirds the size of that of Vesuvius, the entire cone having been formed by7 the erup tions of mud on a larger scale than usual. There is, however, another form of mud volcano common in Sicily, Kertch, the Baku district of the Caspian, and elseAvhere, which goes by the name of Salses or air volcanoes, and, in Sicily, of Macalubas, Avhich consist of coni cal hillocks of mud, chalk, gypsum, and various saline ingredients, including common salt (hence the name Salses), Avhich are formed of materials continually ejected from orifices in the soil by the agency of various gases, such as carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, and nitrogen, with petroleum \\7apours, as in the cases already7 cited from the Baku district (pp. 142, 143). The source of these salses is not quite the same as in those just described, for the mud being generally cold Ave are not per mitted to infer that steam has had much to do Avith such eruptions. In the Taman and Kertch districts large stones, different from those forming the surface strata of the im mediate neighbourhood, are also sometimes ejected* and as flames in some instances issue from the vent it is reasonable to suppose that the source of disturbance is often deep-seated. The flames are, howeA7er, only gases, or pe troleum vapours ignited, and these OAve their origin to the same distilling processes which have originated the gases accompanying them. Sometimes \u2014 as in the case described \u2014 the forces causing the formation of the cones dis play unusual violence. As a rule, hoAA7ever, the hillocks (Fig. 103) vary from a foot or two to betAveen six and seven hundred feet, and even higher, though these comparatively7 lofty eleA7ations are much rarer than the loAver A mud volcano is thus the earliest stage of a volcano.

Some of these humble representatives of volcanoes ,7e have already noticed while discussing the origin of the vapours Avhich accompany or folloAv an eruption (pp. 128, 140\u2014143). condition of decrepitude. The \" Softioni \" of the old volcanic tracts of Italy may also be regarded as dying volcanic vents, which have gradually passed into the solfatara phase. The gases Avhich they give off are carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, etc., which form combinations Avith each other or with the substances they come into contact with on the surface. In Tuscany the \" Softioni \" discharge into lagoons, Avhere they form >a precipitate of boracic acid, sulphur, gypsum, and other substances. A good specimen of the solfatara is afforded by the crater of Tang kuban Prahu, in Java. This is also an example of a tAvin crater ; the Western, or KaAva Upas, (the Poison Crater), is filled with mud, sulphu rous materials, etc., Avhile the Eastern, known as Kawa Ratu, or the King's crater, dis charges steam and sometimes mud. The last eruption was in 1846, Avhen there Avere emitted large quantities of hot Avater, mud, stones, and sand, and the surrounding forest be came charred by the outfloAv. Since then only steam and gas have been discharged, so that the volcano may be regarded as having noAv reached the solfatara stage on the road to decay. Moffettes are especially found in districts subjected to volcanic disturbances, or Avhich have at a comparatively late date been the scene of eruptions \u2014 such as the Eifel, Auvergne (Watterau), and Java. In Southern Italy they are very frequent. The Grotta del Cane \u2014 the Dog's Cave \u2014 near Naples, is an example of a cavity in Avhich carbonic acid (a heavy vapour) accumulates in such quantity that a clog if im mersed in it for a few seconds is rendered insen sible. It is affirmed that this grotto was used as a place of execution for Turkish captives, Avho, when shut up in the atmosphere of this \" breathing-place of Pluto,\" as Pliny called it, soon met Avith that easy death Avhich is so often the fate of those Avho fall asleep in a closed room heated with charcoal in an open brazier. The grotto is to the south-east of the Lago d'Agnano, an ancient crater lake, two miles in circumference, but noAv entirely drained of its former contents. All this region is cavernous. Near the Solfatara, for example, a large stone thrown violently 5n the holloAv ground makes a report like distant artillery7, and it is affirmed that at some points Avater can be heard boiling beneath the surface, f Around the Lake of Avernus were of old erected temples to appease the infernal gods, from whose abodes the pestilential vapours oozed through the soil. Here Ulysses is fabled to have descended to the Shades, and it Avas believed that no bird could fly across its poisoned waters and live, a belief not improbably founde*d on fact, though no longer the case, for Augustus cut a canal, first to admit the waters of the Lucrine Lake, and then those of the sea, into the stagnant Aver nus, so that he might form the Portus Julius. Fumaroles and Moffettes. \u2014 A vapour vent, not necessarily a crater from Avhich fumes are emitted, is knoAvn as a \"fumarole.\"* They are often seen in lava streams in the process of cooling (p. 147). A \" moffette,\" again, marks a still more advanced stage in the decrepitude of a volcano. The name is deriA7ed from the \" Moffette,\" a pool not far from Benevento, in Southern Italy, Avhich is always overhung by a dense layer of carbonic acid. It is iden tified Avith the Lake of Amsanatus described by Virgil (\u00c6n. VIL, 560-568), on the shores of which Avas once a temple to Mephitis, hence the modern name. In summer the pool is often a mere bed of sun-dried sulphurous mud, out of the cracks in Avhich the evil vapours rise in such quantity that birds die when they fly across it, though when the deadly effect of carbonic acid on animal life is knoAvn this cir cumstance is not at all \" una curiosa maladetta,\" * Italian, literally a smoker : plural fumaroli, though generally Anglicised into fumaroles, just as solfatare are t Hare: \"Southern Italy and Sicily\" (1883), pp. 156-158, into solfataras. 163,164."], [237, "GAS SPRINGS. 225 The amount of carbonic acid Avhich is dis charged by these moft'ettes must be enormous. 196,370 and 261,705 pounds of the gas, mingled with some oxygen and nitrogen.

This serves to impregnate the baths of Marienquelle, Avhich are so rich in carbonic acid, that over this and the numerous other springs of the same character, the atmosphere is for the height of tAvo feet so dense that a burning candle loAvered to the surface of the Avater is immediately extinguished. This car bonic acid is, hoAvever, not derived from the decomposition of organic remains, but from the action of acidulated Avater on the under lying limestones, etc. At Burgbrohl, it may be added, the springs charged Avith carbonic acid deposit huge masses of calcareous tufa, like that Avhich, Ave have seen, has accumulated from the hot springs of Carlsbad (p. 55). In this the amount of solid matter is so great that the openings in the \" Sprudelschale \" or hard rock, through Avhich the imprisoned Avaters of the vast subterranean reservoir, or \" Sprudelkessel \" escape, have to be cleared and enlarged every three months. If the Avater and gas are prevented from emerging at any one particular spot, they Avill either burst through the obstruction or force a neAv passage for themselves, to the imminent risk of the buildings overhead being subjected to a geyser like eruption. At the time of the Lisbon earthquake the \" Sprudel \" ceased to Aoav for three days. This shoAvs, as Ave shall have occasion to demonstrate more fully at a later stage (pp. 250, 251), the influence of earth tremors on the drainage. During the same catastrophe at Lisbon the springs of Teplitz became muddy, then disappeared, and, finally, floAved more copiously than before. Those of Clifton, in England, and of Baden near Vienna, also became turbid, and at Luchon, in France, the \" Source de la Reine,\" a merely tepid spring, suddenly attained the temperature of 122\u00b0, Avhich it has retained. The thermal springs of St. Eufemia, in Terra di Amato, were unknoAvn until the earthquake of 1638, and after the Calabrian one of 1783 they became hotter and more copious. After the Lisbon earthquake, all the Baden springs became richer in carbonic acid than before, and the one supplying the \"Angel's Bath\" appeared at that date. In 1770 hot springs broke out in San Domingo after an earthquake, but soon ceased to Aoav ; Avhile, on the other hand, the hot springs of Bagneres de Bigorre became cold after the shocks of 1660. Finally7, it may be added that springs con taining a large amount of gas may simulate geysers. Dr. Peale, for example, mentions that the Kane Geyser Well in Pennsylvania spouts regularly, the eruption being due to gas. An artesian well at Rank Herlany, in Hungary (1,457 feet deep, and of a temperature as high as 75\u00b0), spouts to the height of 100 feet at regular intervals, oAving to the fact that it con tains more carbonic acid than Avater in its volume. The spouting of petroleum Avells is often due to a similar cause. It is thus clear that betAveen a volcano vomiting forth lava and fiery ashes and an effervescing (\" soda\") spring, the Avater of Avhich forms a pleasant drink or an agreeable bath, there are all manner of gradations. They be long, in brief, to the same category of sub terranean phenomena ; though probably be tAveen the tAvo extremes it is not always possible to find the exact links. Not unlikely the deeper sources of the more violent and the shalloAver origin of the milder of these various phenomena may account for much Avhich is otherwise difficult to understand. From the volcano to the geyser the leap is not great, and, as Ave have seen, the hot spring may turn into a geyser, and the geyser return to the unintermittent hot spring stage. Again, betAveen the boiling and the moderately hot spring it is not difficult to find gradations \u2014 Avhile the effervescing and the still ones are in like manner separated by no violent breaks. Indeed, from those Avhich have formed the theme of the last chapter to those Avhich Avill come to be considered under the subject of springs and rivers, the passage is very easy. Before, hoAvever, entering upon the subject of the agents that Avear doAvn the surface Avhich the volcano and the \" secular rise \" have ele- vatcd, it is necessary to consider the character of earthquakes ; but as much of Avhat has been already said has led up to this subject Ave shall not require to discuss these tremblings of the unstable land at such length as would other- Avise have been demanded of us."], [239, "227 CHAPTER XII.

No matter Avhat theory is advocated as to the cause of volcanic disturbances, all agree in regarding these violent outbursts as due to something of the nature of an explosion in or beloAv the solid crust of the earth, the only difference of opinion being as to what the explosion, or commotion, is caused by. It must, hoAvever, sometimes happen that these subterranean disturbances do not result in a volcanic eruption. Either they are not severe enough to burst through the superincumbent strata, or they are of such a character that the force, instead of acting in an upAvard direction, is propagated through the crust in a lateral direction by a series of Avaves. In this case, an earthquake is the result. connection betAA'een the two sets of phenomena there are plenty of earthquakes in quarters of the Avorld Avhere A7olcanoes are unknown. Spain and Portugal, for example, have been the scene of some of the most tremendous of modern earthquakes. Yet there are no active craters in the Peninsula. Great Britain is also a region of mild, though steady7 \" seismic \"* action ; there have been Avithin the period over which history extends several tolerably7 seA-ere shocks in these islands, though, Avith feAV ex ceptions, most of them have done no more damage than causing a sensible tremor, a breakage of crockery, or, at worst \u2014 like that of Essex in 1884 \u2014 a Avreckage of church spires and old houses. Yet, though the Britain of the past Avas a land of oft-repeated volcanic action, at present the nearest actiA-e A7olcanoes are those of Iceland. Indeed, the instruments set up in the tower of Connie Church, in Perthshire, sIioav that the earth is seldom absolutely- still, faint tremors being of continual occurrence, though the bulk of them are so mild as to be unperceived by the human senses. Connection with Volcanoes. \u2014 That earth quakes are closely7 allied to volcanoes is proved by the folloAving facts: \u2014 (1), that volcanic districts are also those frequently affected by earthquakes ; (2), that a volcanic outburst is generally preceded by a greater or less number of earth tremors ; and (3) that a vol canic outburst is often the signal for earth shakings in another or the same region to suddenly cease. The crater seems to act like a safety-valve for the labouring earth. For instance, AA'hen the volcano of St. Vincent, which had been dormant for the better part of a century, burst into reneAved action, the earthquakes in South America, Avhich for many months previously7 had been more than usually lively, ceased. In California, also, it is often remarked that earthquakes are rare while the Hawaiian volcanoes are at Avork. At the same time, thotioh there is thus a close i o Frequency. \u2014 At some time or other there is \u2014 AA7e may7 take it \u2014 an earthquake shock in progress almost eA'eiywhere ; but in ad dition to the thousands recorded, tens of thou sands more haA7e been experienced, though not considered Avorthy/ of their incidents being preserved in Avriting or in popular tradition. * Seism os, Greek for earthquake : seismology is the science of earthquakes. A seismometer is an instrument for recording such movements and measuring their in tensity."], [240, "228 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. BetAveen the years 1865\u20141885, Dr. Fuchs* notes nearly 8,000. Yet Avith the exception of the Peruvian one of 1868, Avhich led to the loss of over 100,000 lives (Fig. 112), that of Granada in 1875, those of Peru in May7, 1877, and January and February, 1878, and those of Chios (1881) and Andalusia (1884), not a great number could be described as being in the first order of such catastrophes. It has, moreover, been noticed that earthquakes, like volcanoes, have a certain periodicity. These periods may occur in regions where earthquakes are rare, as Avell as in those Avhere they are frequent, and, after remaining undisturbed for many decades, a district may be suddenly convulsed by the most violent shocks. of motion varies irregularly during the dis turbance, so much so that, in a protracted shock, the horizontal movements at a single station occur in all possible azimuths.\"): The duration \u2014 that is to say, the time during Avhich the shaking lasts at any one point \u2014 is rarely less than one minute, often tAvo or three, and in one case in the Avriter's experience Avas also as much as tAvelve minutes.\"\u00a7 These observa tions specially apply to the Japanese earth quakes ; but, Avith modifications, they hold true of terrestrial tremors everywhere else. It is thus clear that, contrary to the belief on the subject, the earthquake motion is not always in a determinate direction. In one felt at Tokio on the 8th of March, 1881, the horizontal path was almost circular, though the time occupied from the beginning to the end of the vibration was only three seconds, and it did no damage except to crack a feAV Avails. The wave passing through the crust displaces a certain portion of the ground ; to this the cracks in the earth, and the damage to the buildings on it, are due. But just as observers often differ Avidely amongst them selves as to the direction of the prevailing oscillation, so they do regarding the magnitude of the displacement of the ground. This is generally much exaggerated. In the great Neapolitan earthquake of 1857 (Fig. 113) it is said to have amounted to a foot ; and in the Manila earthquake of 1881, Abella assigns six feet as the amplitude. But such displace ments must be rare, for when the motion is as much as a quarter of an inch, brick and stone chimneys are generally shattered. At the same time the automatic seismographs have never yet recorded any great shocks ; and, as the apparatus Avould most likely be thiwvn out of gear by a disaster of any magnitude, it is not probable that in future Ave shall be able to dispense Avith guesses founded on the misconception of observers, Avho in the tur moil of an earthquake are not very Avell fitted to weigh facts calmly. Seismic Waves. \u2014 The accurate instruments Avhich have been invented of late years enable us to notice and record features of earthquake disturbances which Avere formerly missed. The result of the activity of the last few years \u2014 especially in Japan, Avhere the labours of Professors Milne, EAving, Gray, Skida, and Chaplin, have almost revolutionised former ideas on the subject \u2014 has been to prove that during an earthquake there is a number of successive vibrations. In some cases as many as three hundred have been distinctly registered. These vibrations are irregular, both in period and amplitude \u2014 or deviation from the normal \u2014 and the amplitude does not exceed a few millimetres,\"!- even Avhen the earthquake is of sufficient severity to throw doAvn chimneys and crack walls, Avhile in many instances the greatest motion is no more than the fraction of a millimetre. \" The periods of the principal motions are usually from half a second to a second, but the early part of the disturbance often contains vibra tions of much greater frequency. The earth quake generally begins and always ends very gradually-, and it is a noteAvorthy fact that there is in general no one motion standing out from the rest, or greatly larger than those which precede and folloAv it.

Every railway traveller knoAvs that it is not the steady speed, but the starting and stop ping, Avhich jar him. That is to say, it is the change of velocity by Avhich he is shaken. In as in Calabria in 1783 and Missouri in 1811, the trees are often so much depressed that the boughs, Avhen they reach the ground, break off, and forests or groves are noticed to wave to and fro like a field of corn before a breeze. Professor Milne, by explosions of gun cotton in holes in the ground and by the fall of heavy Aveights, produced small artificial earth- Fig. 113. \u2014 STEEET VIEW IN POLLA (THE ANCIENT FORUM POPILIl), AFTEE THE EAETHQUAKE OF 1857, (From an Engraving in \" The Great Neapolitan Earthquake of IS57,\" by Robert Mallet.) like manner, as Professor George Darwin points out, the misconception of an observer in an earthquake arises from the fact that the sensation of being \" tossed about \" comes from the change of velocity to Avhich he is subjected, rather than from the extent of his displace ment. \" The greatest change per second of velocity may be considerable in a vibration whilst the amplitude is small.\" This delusion is assisted by the appearance of the scene around the observer. Spires are SAvaying, and, quakes. From these experiments, and actual facts observed during the many earthquakes Avith Avhich Japan is shaken, he has come to the conclusion that earthquake Avaves consist of tAvo kinds of oscillations, namely: \u2014 (1), waves or vibrations of compression ; (2), Avaves or vibrations of distortion. In the first kind the motion of each particle of the ground is to and fro in the direction in AA-hich the wave is travelling; and in the second kind, the \"ex cursions are at right angles to the direction of"], [242, "230 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. wave propagation. As the former vibrations travel more rapidly than the latter, all the compressional waves may have passed a given station before the arrival of the distortional waves, and thus the shock may be apparently duplicated. Or, nearer to the origin, the two series Avill overlap, and a complex movement ensues.\" Reflections and refractions as the Avaves pass from one geological stratum to another further complicate the phenomena. But \" the rate at Avhich these waves travel depends on the nature of the rock through which the movement passes.\" Mallet found that in solid granite the rate was about 1,666 feet per second, Avhile in Avet sand it was as sIoav as 825 feet per second. breadth. Within these bands the seismic in fluence is felt for a distance varying from 5 to 15 degrees of longitude, Avhile outside these areas, shocks are rare and of attenuated character. These seismic bands very fre quently folloAv the lines of elevation Avhich mark and divide the great oceanic or terr oceanic basins of the earth's surface, and if these happen to be mountain chains, then the seismic bands folloAv these likeAvise, especially if (as is frequently the case) such chains con tain volcanic vents. Finally, though seismic energy thus becomes sensible at any point of the earth's surface, its efforts become greater as the chief lines of volcanic activity are ap proached, Avhile the width of these seismic bands depends upon \" the energy developed, and on the accidental geological and topo graphical conditions along its length.\" The initial point of the Avave or succession of Avaves traversing the earth's crust which con stitute a shock is at some depth in the sub terranean Avorld (Fig. 114). This \"centre of impulse \" is often beneath the sea, but in In hard rocks the fissures are narroAver, and they close more quickly than in soft ones. Hence less displacement is caused, and natu rally less destruction. It is also noted that Avhen a Avave passes from compact into loose rocks, the complexity caused by \"reflection and reverberation of shocks \" tends to a more destructive shattering of the surface than Fig. 114.\u2014 DIAGEAM ILLUSTEATING MALLET'S THEOKY OF THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT FBOM EAETHQUAKE FOCUS.

Mallet considered that the Galabrian shock of 1857, Avhich destroyed so many toAvns, originated betAveen three and seven miles beloAv the surface (Fig. 116).

The underground noises Avhich immediately precede a shock have been variously likened to chains pulled about, to the rumbling of carriages, the roll of thunder, the discharge of a park of artillery, heavy Avaggons running in a road, the hissing produced by the quenching of red-hot iron in Avater, the rush of Avind underground, \" the rumble made by heavy ore teams in passing ;\"f and in the Charleston earthquake of September 2nd, 1886 \u2014 the origin of which Avas calculated to be at about tAvelve miles beneath the sur face, and the Avave of transmission to be pro pagated at the rate of over three miles a seconds \u2014 most observers noted merely a \" rumbling sound,\" as either preceding, ac companying, or succeeding the shocks which occurred on that day7, or folloAved on subse quent days (Figs. 126, 127, 128).

The Yokohama earthquake of 1880 seems to haA7e had its centre at a depth of from one and a half to five miles, and in one case it is believed that the initial point of the earthquake was fully fifty miles beneath the surface, though, as a rule, the centre of most shocks is not more than a feAV miles in the crust Avhich they shake. Seismologists are, moreover, beginning to hold the opinion that the shocks do not \" usually originate in a single point, but rather along a line of a mile or two in length.\" Hence the vagueness with Avhich the position of the centre of disturb ance \u2014 or \" centre of impulse,\" to use Mallet's expression \u2014 of particular earthquakes has been assigned. On the other hand, many earthquakes are not accompanied by any underground sounds. Of this character Avas that Avhich on the 23rd of February, 1887, shook the coast district of France and Italy knoAvn as the Riviera (Fig. 117), and extended across the Atlantic with sufficient intensity to disturb the instruments in the Washington Observatory, the rate of travel being about 500 miles an hour. Again, in South America and elsewhere underground sounds are often heard Avithout earthquakes folloAving in their immediate train. These facts, therefore, tend to show that the force which generates the earthquake must, in some instances, be so sudden that it gives But be the focus where it may, the Avaves proceed thence Avith equal velocity in every direction.

Nearly all theories regarding the cause of earthquakes, however, agree in considering generated, and therefore no impulse is imparted to the crust greater than what is sufficient to generate the tremblings Avhich so generally precede the main shocks. But Avhen the heated surfaces cool, the Avater being able to come into closer contact with them evolves vast volumes of steam, Avhich, bloAving off' into the deep cold water of the sea, gets condensed, Fig. 11C\u2014 CATHEDRAL OF TITO, SHATTERED BY THE EARTHQUAKE OF 1857. (Aster Robert Mallet.) them due to some such hypothetical ex plosions \u2014 closely akin in their nature to those which generate volcanic eruptions. Among the many hypotheses Avhich have been pro posed, that of Mallet for long received very general support. (1), He assumes the internal molten centre of the earth for granted. Then when water enters through the fissures in the crust, made when there is a volcanic discharge under the sea, it first assumes the spheroidal condition, in which state little steam is and thus imparts a violent blow at the vol canic focus, Avhich being transferred outAvardly in all directions is transmitted through the crust in the form of the familiar earthquake tremors. The gentler tremblings after a shock are regarded as due to the feebler discharges of steam from the comparatively cool surfaces. But when the surfaces again become heated from the molten mass, the phases described may begin afresh. At the same time, Avhile regarding the circumstances mentioned as the"], [245, "CAUSES OF EARTHQUAKES. 233 principal causes of earthquakes, Mallet is willing to grant that some of them may be densation under pressure of sea-Avater ; or to great fissures and dislocations in the rocky due to \" the evolution of steam through fissures and its irregular and per saltum con- crust, suddenly produced by pressure acting on it from beneath, or in any other direction.\""], [246, "234 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. (2), This, to some extent, accords Avith the theory AA-hich regards earthquakes as move ments \" caused by a shrinking from loss of heat of the heated interior of the earth and the crushing together and displacement of the rigid exterior as it accommodates itself to the contracting nucleus,\"* Avhich Ave have seen has been invoked to account for more than one phenomenon in the earth's history (pp. 85, 175, 189). many of the earthquakes of Central Europe may, as Ave shall see (pp. 252-5) when Ave discuss the effects of shocks, be due to this cause, j and it is likely that many of those of India and other mountainous regions may be traced to a similar uneasiness in the earth's crust, due to this sinking doAvn Avith the object of accommodating itself to the con tracting nucleus. But in Japan and most other extremely volcanic centres, the ex plosions of steam from Avater which has found its way into the earth from the rainfall or from the sea must be regarded as the prin cipal agents in the many convulsions to Avhich volcanic tracts are specially subjected. (3), It is also more than probable that some earthquakes are mere local collapses of the crust from the underlying rocks being dis solved out by Avater, or other causes. This seems to have been the real origin of the \" earthquake \" \u2014 if it can so be designated \u2014 which destroyed so many buildings and caused so much loss of life on the Island of Ischia in the y7ear 1883,t and of those minor tremors which are of constant occurrence in the honey-combed limestone district of the Karst, north of Trieste. In the Visp Valley in Can ton Valais (SAvitzerland), continued rumblings and sharp shocks lasted for upwards of a month in 1855 ; but these earth movements, though of sufficient intensity to fissure build ings and cause many of the ordinary results of earthquakes, are believed to have been due solely to the subsidence of the crust over lying strata rendered unsubstantial by the numerous springs Avhich dissolve out the gypsum Avith which they are permeated. This cause can, hoAvever, have only a local bearing, unless indeed AA7e believe that the earth is like a Gruy7ere cheese, full of cavities, constantly falling in, or Avith their gaseous contents often exploding. (5), In addition to the causes here enume rated, there may, doubtless, as Professor Shaler seems to think, be earthquakes due to the rush of imprisoned lava through the earth's crust in filling up the rifts Avhich Ave knoAv as dykes \u2014 this action being at Avork noAv as Avell as in the past, \u2014 though this cause may be properly bracketed under the head of volcanoes and their connection Avith earth quakes. Minor or local earthquakes may also possibly be produced in cold countries Avhen the frozen ground rives asunder OAving to the expansii n of the contained Avater in freezing. The crevice may be but a fraction of an inch Avide and a foot or tAvo deep, yet the ground is often so violently jarred that a sensible earth quake is produced, Avhich may be felt hun dreds of feet aAvay from the source of distur bance. Indeed, a comparatively slight shock vibrates through the earth's crust for very great distances. The mines used for the blasting of the reefs at Hell Gate, near New York, in 1886, though trifling compared Avith the great steam explosions in the earth's in terior, generated a shock Avhich Avas distinctly perceptible 100 miles from the point Avhere the bloAv was struck, and faintly at nearly double that distance. (4), Professor Milne seems to incline to the belief of the Continental geologists, that earth quakes may be due to the breaking of strata while mountains are being tilted up OAving to the secular cooling of the earth, as Avell as by underground explosions of steam. Possibly (6), Lastly, Ave may notice the theory pro posed by the brothers Rogers. They regard the actual pulsation in the fluid matter beneath * Newberry: \"Earthquakes\" (1886); Homes, in Jahr buch der E.K. Geol.

The main difficulty in this hypothesis is, that no such \" pulsation \" has ever y7et been even remotely shown to be probable, any more than the tidal Avaves in the earth's crust (Avhich also have been suggested) can be shown by anything like proof to exist. More over, these theories demand the admission of a liquid interior \u2014 a demand Avhich at once rules it out of court in the eyes of those Avho insist on the non-existence of such a con dition of the subterranean world. Indeed, the fact of our old ideas on this subject having been unsettled by the promulgation of a doctrine so absolutely the antipodes of the one Avhich it is intended to displace, has not improved the facility Avith Avhich theorists explain volcanoes and earthquakes. The probabilities, hoAveA7er, are that they may be due to a variety of causes, and that, in spite of all that has been said against it, shrinking due to contraction may be one potent factor in precipitating some, Avhile the explosion of steam, in one of the various Avays suggested, may be the cause to Avhich Ave must look for the explanation of others Avhich cannot Avell come under the former head. already seen (p. 227), all earthquaking regions are not volcanic. Spain and Portugal, for example, are not the seats of active volcanoes ; and the United States are, in the region most recently affected, equally clear of volcanic vents. Britain is also a region of mild earth quakes ; so is Hungary ; yet neither is a land of active volcanic action. Even in Japan \u2014 a land of extreme volcanic energy * \u2014 volcanoes cannot be described as the direct causes of the earthquakes, for 80 per cent, of them come from the sea-board \u2014 many of them from the sea itself \u2014 Avhile the shocks are generally felt on one side of a volcano only-. Quasi-scientific Theories. \u2014 This being the case, it is not necessary7 to more than refer to many other quasi-scientific theories Avhich have been put foi'Avard Avith the object of solving the problem. Not to mention the mythical demons and not less fabulous deities moving uneasily7 under the surface \u2014 a doctrine held to this day by many savage and semi barbarous peoples \u2014 the notion of subterranean Avinds \u2014 an idea not improbably suggested by the rushing sound of the premonitory noises (p. 231) \u2014 being the primary causes of earth quakes Avas held by7 Aristotle, Pliny, and other ancient Avriters, and obtained a classical sanc tion from Shakespeare.-f Indeed, it main tained its ground in England Avell up to the middle of last century, AA-hen it Avas displaced by the electrical theory. EA-en yet this ex tremely hypothetical notion is entertained by people Avho might be supposed to knoAv better. Stukely, Percival, and Priestley, advocated the idea of earthquakes being in some way, not very clearly explained, caused by electrical currents, and in California to this day it is quite common to hear that since the State has It thus appears that, in the present state of our knoAvledge Ave can no more attribute earthquakes to one cause than we can vol canoes. Indeed, as the reader must already have been led to see, all speculation on the subject is, and must be, purely conjectural, and the man Avho insists that any particular dogma affords the key to the solution is simply deceiving himself and his readers. That there is some connection \u2014 a very close connection, indeed \u2014 between earth quakes and volcanoes cannot, hoAvever, admit of any doubt; yet Avhat this exactly is Ave cannot affirm Avith confidence. All volcanic countries are also earthquaking ; but, Ave have * In the Japanese Islands there are 48 active volcanoes, and 83 regarding which records of eruptions exist, or which have evidently been active in recent times, as shown by their solfataras. In the five years between 1876 and 1S81 Tokio experienced 377 earthquake shocks. f \" Diseased Nature oftentimes breaks forth In strange eruptions : oft the teeming earth Is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed By the imprisoning of unruly wind Within her womb ; which, for enlargement striving, Shakes the old beldam earth, and topples down Steeples and moss-grown towei-s.\" \u2014 1 Hen.

In March, 1881, Casa micciola Avas almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake, and a month later the island of Chios Avas nearly ruined by a similar mis fortune. The same year saAV Agram con vulsed with serious earthquakes, and then the south of Spain suffered even more severely. The Alps, various parts of Italy, and the Greek Islands Avere the next to be attacked, and the tremors Avhich shook so many hundred square miles of Greece seem to have crossed the Atlantic and laid the city of Charleston in ruins. In 1887 Ave had the Riviera shocks, and a few months later many districts of Northern Mexico, Arizona, and a large area of Central Asia, were shaken. Altogether, Avithout going into de tails, it is certain that of late there has been an unusual period of subterranean activity over a very wide region of the world, even if we do not always grasp the relation betAveen such circumstances as the eruption of some of the Kamtchatka volcanoes, about three months before the great Krakatau ex plosion, f They may be coincidences, or they may have the connection of cause and effect. Still, it is possible to mark out several broad bands Avhich may be considered the proper home of earthquakes. These bands (Fig. 118) have a tendency to pull \" end to end,\" so that, as Professor George Darwin puts it, they may be regarded as a single ribbon embracing half the earth, and which it may be suspected really meets itself and forms a closed curve. This, however, cannot as yet be proved. If Ave begin to trace its course at Cape Horn, it Avill be found that it folloAvs the Andes along the whole Avestern side of South America\u2014 and this comprises some of the most noto riously earthquake-shaken regions ofthe Avorld. It then broadens out, and passing along the line of the West Indies from Trinidad to Cuba, been intersected by railways, the \" dangerous electrical accumulations \" being diverted from the soil, earthquakes have been largely re duced; and theorists haA7e not been lacking Avho, Avithout producing any proof in support of their assertion, have predicted that the same vviU hold true of Japan Avhen iron-Avays spread o\\7er the islands. Nevertheless, it is Avell known that electrical phenomena do accompany earthquakes, affecting telegraphic cables and lines, and that in Mauritius earth currents have been found to precede the shocks so frequent in that volcanic part of the world. In Japan also, there are cases on record in which earthquakes Avere either accompanied or preceded by abnormal earth currents. But all evidence and reasoning thus far adduced tend to show that such currents are a consequence, rather than a cause, of conditions producing earthquakes.* Hoav far, if at all, particular atmospheric states influence or precipitate earthquakes may be best discussed Avhen Ave come to consider the possibility of forecasting the occurrence of these phenomena (p. 256). Distribution of Earthquakes. While it may be taken for granted that no large area of the earth's surface is ever entirely free from tremblings, there are grounds for believing that not only are certain regions more subject to earthquakes than others, but that there are certain periods of time Avhen these phenomena are more marked than at others. For example, to go no farther back than the last feAV years, the globe has shown that it is losing little of the Titanic vigour of her youth, or, at all events, that, in Avhat some philosophers have described as her feeble senility, the earth is quite capable of efforts equal to anything which we have reason to believe Avas Avitnessed in the past. Volcanic disturbances have followed each other in rapid succession. First came the gigantic explosion of Krakatau, the greatest Avithin the memory of history, and before long both Etna and Vesuvius Avere in eruption ; Avhile the neigh bouring region was more or less disturbed by t Guillemard: \" Cruise of the Marchesa\" (1887).

From Java another branch takes its Avay through NeAv Guinea to NeAv Zealand, and it is quite possible that the closed curve may be completed by the Antarctic regions, which Ave have seen are volcanic. But this it is still impossible to assert for certain, as these lands are almost entirely unexplored. regarded as an extension from the West Indian area of seismic activity7, and though a recurrence of slight shocks may be expected for a year or tAvo, it is likely to remain a unique occurrence. Prior to the great Lisbon earthquake of November 1st, 1755, that toAvn had been visited by shocks of greater or less intensity7. But these Avere almost forgotten Avhen in a feAV minutes the city Avas laid in ruins, and betAveen fifty and sixty thousand people lost their lives by this sudden catas trophe, the like of Avhich has never been paralleled in modern times. The city of Fez in Northern Morocco Avas so violently affected that, it is affirmed by the Moorish historians, 12,000 people perished. Setubal was almost entirely destroyed, a large part of Malaga Avas ruined, and Coimbra, Oporto, and Baya, all suffered to a greater or less extent, Avhile the island of Madeira was laid Avaste, and in the Greek Island of Mytilene more than 2,000 houses Avere overthroAvn. This shock Avas felt as far north as the Scandinavian Peninsula, and as far east as North America. Yet, Avhile Loch Lomond in Scotland Avas so influenced by the seismic Avave that its Avaters rose and fell convulsively, the earthquake does not seem to have been noticeably felt in England* most probably OAving to the fact that the Avave travelling through hard rocks at a great depth beloAv the ground, \" the slight shook communicated to the thicker mass of softer rocks Avhich form the greater part of England died aAvay before it reached the surface.\" Much the same fact holds true regarding other earthquakes, and it is believed that the one Avhich did such damage to Charleston Avould have been infinitely more disastrous had not the city been underlaid by quick sands, Avhich being an imperfectly elastic material, rapidly extinguished the energy of the shocks Avhich, moreover, though reaching nearly a thousand miles aAvay from their centre of origin, Avere at their point of greatest intensity more than ten miles distant from Charleston. Yet from 1755 to the present hour Lisbon has been rarely affected by a To the Avest of Java the seismic region is less continuous, though the ribbon may be traced through India, Persia, Syria, the Eastern Mediterranean, Greece, and Italy. In other Avords, the Old World region of earthquakes is mainly betAveen the Alps and the mountains of Northern Africa, its eastern limits taking in the Mediterranean, and the inland seas to the east, on to the mountains of Central Asia ; while the NeAv World area increases in in tensity from the Atlantic States, Avhich are occasionally affected, to the Pacific, the entire area of Avhich and its land borders are, either inferentially or actually-, the seat of severe seismic disturbance. We might therefore say, in general terms, that the range of earthquakes is practically the same as that of volcanoes, though, of course, there are mild shocks in lands Avhere there are no craters either dormant or active. All that is meant by the \" seismic bands \" is that they mark out the \" one great principal line of cracking of the earth's surface.\" Professor Dainvin, hoAvever, while thus contending for a continuous band of seismic action, admits that the disturbed areas are not absolutely constant in their limits, and cases are knoAvn where regions previously almost quiescent have become dis turbed. Charleston is a case in point, the previous tremors in South Carolina having been rare and comparatively mild. In reality, the earthquake Avhich Avrought such damage to the South Carolinian city (Figs. 126, 127, 128) may more appropriately be * Peerless Pond, near the City Road, London, is said to have been agitated."], [251, "INTENSITY OF EARTHQUAKES. 239 seismic Avave. Several shocks, mostly of no great severity, have occurred. In 1847 the royal family fled from the palace, in the vicinity of Avhich fissures from one inch to several feet Avide opened. But very little damage has been done. (2), Partial or entire destruction of build ings, or in which all except the strongest edifices are overthroAvn, \" great pinnacles of rock overturned, and the soil rent by occa sional fissures.\" To this group the Charles ton earthquake, and those of Greece, Agram, and Spain, already referred to, belong. The only other point Avhich has been ascertained Avith anything like certainty re o-arding the connection of earthquakes Avith geological structure is, that they generally folloAV fines of faulting (p. 252), and that there fore the \" seismic ribbons \" may not unlikely be \" lines of weakness along Avhich cracking habitually takes place.\" For this, or for some reason which has not yet been hit upon, certain regions are more liable to disturbance than others, and in Japan, Avhere there is on au average at least one earthquake every tAventy-four hours, some spots are notoriously subject to shocks. Mr. Milne mentions a princely mansion at Tokio \" Avhich has so great a reputation for the severity of the shakings it receives, that its marketable value has been considerably depreciated, and it is iioav untenanted.\"* (3), Falling of chimneys, splits in Avails or buildings, when the latter are of an old or Aveak character, but Avith \" the natural fea tures of the surface not much disturbed.\" In this group Professor Shaler places the Massachusetts earthquake of 1755. Those of Essex in April, 1884 ; of the Riviera in 1887 (Figs. 119, 121, 122); of Visp, in Valais, Switzer land, in July, 1855, also felt in Paris ; Gross gerau, in Hesse, in 1869 ; and of Klana or of the Karst, Avhich lasted from the 27th of February to the 8th of July, 1870, may also be placed under this head, though it is not ahvays possible to exactly allocate each earth quake to the classes thus systematised. (4), Falling doAvn of movable objects, breakage of plaster from the Avails, ring ing of church bells, and general terror; but no damage to buildings, and no distinct in fluence upon the natural features of the earth's surface. Intensity of Earthquakes. The violence of a shock, or series of shocks, Avhich, combined, Ave knoAv as an earthquake, varies from the faintest tremor barely per ceptible by the seismograph, Avhich automati cally records the oscillation of the ground, to the most violent of Avhich history has pre served any record. The Saviss Commission appointed to investigate the subject has draAvn up a scale Avhich is useful for recording, approximately at least, the degree of intensity exhibited by any earthquake. It is as folloAvs, the graduation, hoAvever, being inverted : \u2014 (1), A great calamity: ruins of buildings, faffing of rocks, upheaval and gashing of the earth, and fall of cliffs and even of parts of mountains, Avhile the soil covering of the earth is \"shaken as in a sieve.\" Of this group, the great earthquakes of Peru, and of Lisbon and Calabria, and those of NeAv Madrid, in Missouri, may be taken as examples. (5), Universal aAvakening of sleepers, general stoppage of clocks, ringing of house bells, smashing of candelabra, glass, and crockery, and visible oscillation of trees, bushes, and spires, Avhen A-ery narroAV and high. It may be added that Avhen the earthquake is of this degree of intensity there is a general rush from the houses, camping out in the squares and fields and Avhat the Americans know as \" de moralisation \" of the population. In Charleston the negroes Avere especially subject to panic ; and in Spain \u2014 though the churches Avere not croAvded, OAving to dread of the roofs falling \u2014 the images of saints and all open-air shrines Avere surrounded by devotees.

OAving to the enthusiasm of Bertelli, Rossi, Malvasia, Monte, Cecchi, Palmieri, Egidi, Galli, and others \u2014 great attention has been paid to this curious branch of seismology. By calling in the help of the microphone, the commotion made by these movements can be heard. When this instrument Avas placed in a cavern sixty feet below the surface of Rocca di Papa, an extinct volcano not far from Rome, Rossi heard the most extraordinary sounds \u2014 \" roar ings, explosions, occurring isolated or in volleys, and metallic or bell-like sounds \" \u2014 all mixed together, and rising and falling in in tensity at irregular intervals. Microseismic motions and seismic storms have also been observed by the brothers Danvin in Eng land.* (7), Slight movements affecting persons in the near neighbourhood of the centre of origin, and shaking of various objects, such as AvindoAvs, doors, loose or split boards, etc. (8), Slight motion folloAved by a period of silence, the direction and duration of the Avave being unascertained. (9), Shock only ascertainable by means of the seismograph, folloAved by a subsequent period of quietude. (10), Minute motions that can only be re gistered by the best-constructed instruments. Yet even these numerous gradations of earthquake intensity do not exhaust the mo bility to Avhich the unstable globe is subject. Recent observations, indeed, go far to demon strate not only that the earth is in some place or other being continually shaken by more or less perceptible tremors, but that at almost any spot, even in regions Avhich are not knoAvn to be liable to such commotions, the soil is in a continual tremor, like a mass of jelly on a table Avhen heavy footsteps are passing across the floor. Not only is the ground subject to Avhat Mr. Milne has called \" earth pulsations \" \u2014 or temporary SAvayings of the earth so sIoav that, though occupying from a feAV seconds to a feAV hours, they do not give any sense of shock, and can best be observed by means of delicate spirit-levels, the bubbles of Avhich move Avith very slight changes of level at either end of the instru ment \u2014 but to rapid motion in almost every second of time. There are also \" seismic storms,\" or periods Avhen the terrestrial agita tion is more intense than usual, the storm sometimes culminating in a shock Avhich can be perceived Avithout instruments. Then a period of relative quiescence ensues. The vi bration of the instruments devised to record these movements is, in general, parallel to neighbouring valleys or chains of mountains, and, though seemingly independent of Avind, rain, and temperature, is especially apt to be intense Avhen the barometer is Ioav. These \"microseismic\" storms, Professor Darwin notes, are not strictly simultaneous at different places, though there is a close agreement betAveen those Avhich occur in Italy, where \u2014 Hoav these \"microscopic earthquakes\" are caused has still to be ascertained. It is possible that they are due to movements in the immediate neighbourhood, or more pro bably they are the reverberations of very distinct shocks. In the vicinity of a dormant or extinct volcano they may be simply the uneasy movements of the imprisoned forces, labouring to reneAv their quondam activity. One hour and fourteen minutes subsequent to a very seA7ere shock at Iquique, in Peru, the instruments in the St. Petersburg Obser vatory Avere agitated. Astronomers are also Avell aAvare that the piers of their instruments undergo slight changes of level, or \" displace ments of the vertical,\" though they are still, in spite of the many observations Avhich have been made on the subject, unable to satis factorily explain it. When, hoAvever, we know the almost continuous series of earthquake shocks, perfectly noticeable to the senses, Avhich are going on, and that many regions of the Avorld are sloAvly rising and falling, we need not be surprised that \"microseismic\" tremors are observable in the earth's crust. The Avonder Avould be Avere they not present. The Aveight of the sea \u2014 Avhich, according to Professor Danvin's calculations, is, on every square foot of the bottom, 620 lbs.

As the \" microseismic \" movements often precede the greater ones, in time they may be utilised as warnings of what is to come. 16"], [254, "2i2 CHAPTER XIII.

The course Avhich an earthquake runs is usually very rapid. From the moment Avhen the first shock Avas felt at Lisbon to the period when all was over, and nearly 30,000 people were killed,* not more than four minutes elapsed. A feAV seconds are usually a more frequent time for the shock or shocks to last. Yet, Avhile Caracas in Venezuela Avas almost destroyed, and 12,000 of its inhabitants killed by the earthquake of 1812, Avithin the limits of half a minute, there are cases in which constantly -recurring shocks last for Aveeks, months, and even years, as if the labouring earth Avas still trying to relieve itself of some of its superabundant energy. For ex ample, the Calabrian earthquake of February, 1783, Avas not quite finished before December, 1786, and it is a common observation that the preliminary shock is usually folloAved by one of greater severity, and this in its turn by others less intense, like the distant claps of thunder which herald the passing storm. But in this brief span the most frightful havoc can be wrought, and the wave of de struction propagated from the most distant regions. The rumbling earth sound travels, for instance, at the rate of 10,000 or 11,000 feet per second, and the earth Avave, on an average, about 1,200 feet in the same space of time, though in Charleston, as Ave have seen, a much higher rate was attained (p. 231). But if the terror inspired by earthquakes and the sickness produced by the SAvaying motion are sufficiently alarming, the after effects, of even the slightest of these tremors, are sufficiently terrible to cause all the dread Avhich their recurrence inspires in the minds of even those familiar from childhood Avith their results. The Earthquake Wave.\u2014 In earthquakes originating under the sea, the Avave of water propagated outwards, and SAveeping far inland Avith relentless force, is, to the regions lying near the shore, perhaps the most destructive of all the after effects of a shock. It is gene rally knoAvn as the \" tidal wave,\" but in truth it has nothing Avhatever to do Avith tides, and is really a Avave of displacement. ' When the shock occurs the sea is, as it Avere, sucked back from the shore, and then returns in a wall of water Avhich rushes inland, sweeping before it men and cattle, trees and houses, to be folloAved at intervals by smaller Avaves. The velocity Avith Avhich it travels depends, first, on the force of the propelling shock, and secondly, on the depth of the sea, the Avave being propagated much more quickly through deep than through shallow water. An earth quake wave surged across the North Pacific from Japan to California at the rate of more than six miles a minute, and from the time at Avhich the sea .wave from the Lisbon earth quake was noticed at the mouth of the Thames, its speed must have been a little over tAvo miles a minute, though, on the other hand, it crossed the Atlantic to Barbadoes at a speed more than twice as swift. In Lisbon probably more people Avere destroyed by the \"tidal Avave\" than from any other cause; * This number of people was destroyed in the first few minutes. But there were in all twenty-two shocks, with a loss of nearly 60,000 lives ; in the city prison 800 were killed, and 1,200 in the general hospital."], [255, "THE EARTHQUAKE WAVE. 243 while along the Pacific coast of South America, the coming Avave is always more dreaded than the more immediate results of the shocks. In Peru especially has the Avave been dreadfully destructive. On the 28th of October, 1746, Callao was so com pletely destroyed by one which folloAved the great earthquake of that date, that, to quote a contemporary Spanish account of the catas trophe, vast heaps of sand and gravel oc cupied the spot Avhere it formerly stood, and, instead of a busy port, only a \" spacious strand \" extending along the coast remained. Towers and toAvn \u2014 though the latter Avas on an elevation \u2014 fell before the prodigious force of the wave, Avhich, after reaching a height of 80 feet, swept on towards Lima, carrying before it the ships in port and stranding them on dry ground far beyond the harbour. Only two great gates, and here and there some fragments of Avails, remained to attest the extent of the calamity. In this flood Avere droAvned all the inhabitants of the place, numbering upAvards of 5,000, except some two hundred Avho managed to cling to pieces of floating Avreck. Happily, the wave abated its force before it reached the capital, seven miles distant. HaAvaii commenced to advance at 5 a.m. on the 10th of May, 1877, and continued till the folloAving morning, alternately rushing in and receding once in ten minutes. About fifty houses Avere destroyed, and the little church Avas moved bodily for a distance of about 200 feet. \" It travelled,\" one of the most accomplished historians of the island tells us, \" Avith much dignity, tolling its bell as it Avent, and was scarcely injured at all.\" This, it has been suggested, was the same wave Avhich ovenvhelmed Iquique in Peru, 8,000 miles aAvay. If so, it must have travelled at the improbable rate of 450 miles an hour. In 1811 the water suddenly receded from Honolulu, leaving the harbour partially dry and the reef bare. \" It quickly returned, but rushed out. This little freak occupied about forty minutes, after Avhich the sea Avas as calm as before. At the same moment the tide suddenly rose at Lahaina or Maui, at a distance of 100 miles. It rose and fell repeatedly at intervals of four minutes, rushing over the reefs Avith furious noise. It was aftenvards reported that a similar phenomenon occurred on the coast of Kamtchatka at the same time.\" * On the 7th of November, 1837, an earthquake Avave even more remarkable Avas felt throughout the entire group, but most seriously in Maui and HaAvaii, Avhere it destroyed much pro perty and many lives. At five in the after noon, Avhen everything seemed peaceful, and the islands Avere bathed in their wonted sun shine, the sea began rapidly to retreat from the shore, leaving the reefs entirely- dry7. Then suddenly, as the light-hearted natives were busy catching the stranded fishes, the Avater rapidly returned, and in half an hour rose to the highest tide mark. On a second recur rence the sea fell six feet, and then returned, and this \" it continued to do with gradually decreasing force till noon on the folloAving day.\" This Avas the general character of the wave at Honolulu. But on Maui it assumed much more serious proportions, the AA7a\\7e, on its first return, rushing in like a great wall of water, sweeping all before it, and overwhelm in\"' in a common destruction houses, canoes. This great earthquake Avas preceded for some days by subterranean noises, and after the first shock, on the 28th of October, there were, in twenty-four hours, 220, the disturb ance not finishing until the folloAving Feb ruary. On the 13th of August, 1868, an earthquake Avhich nearly destroyed Arequipa was succeeded by a wave Avhich overwhelmed Arica and Iquique ; and on the 9th of May, 1877, nearly all of the southern ports had to bear the brunt of another. Some of the most remarkable results of the Krakatau eruption, so far as its human interest Avas concerned, were due to the earthquake wave which fol loAved, Anjer (Ave have seen) being Avashed away, and Telokbetong, in Sumatra, being, among other places, almost entirely destroyed (p. 160). The Sandwich Islands are equally subject to these after effects of earthquakes.

Not even a canoe escaped ; and though the amphibious natives of the SandAvich Islands can generally hold their OAvn in sAvimming, several Avere killed by being dashed against the floating Avreck, or, unable to make head- Avay against the violent suction of the ad vancing or retreating Avave, sank exhausted in the Avater. Yet, curiously enough, it is especially noted by the HaAvaiian chroniclers that except from the fact of the caldera of Kilauea having been in violent action on the previous night, there had been nothing un usual felt. An earthquake shock had not been experienced, so that the disturbance Avhich had set in motion this vast mass of Avater \u2014 sufficient to sweep many isles at the same time \u2014 must have originated at a great distance in the least land-dotted expanse of the Pacific. In concluding these remarks upon earth quake Avaves, it may be useful to note the simple illustration of their formation Avhich Professor Shaler, of Harvard, has devised. \" Take a flat-bottomed Avide pan of any sheet metal partly filled Avith water ; let us strike it a sharp upward bloAV upon its base. We see that the Avater rises in the centre, and rolls oft in a broad circular Avave toAvards the margin. In the sea this Avave may have a diameter of some scores of miles, though its height pro bably never exceeds a feAV feet. It is so Avide and low, that as long as it is in deep water it may slip unnoticed beneath a ship ; but Avhen the front edge of the wave comes into the shallows near the shore, its advance is some- Avhat retarded by the friction of t*he bottom, Avhile the part which is farther out to sea retains its swift motion. The wave is thus croAvded into a less space, and so becomes constantly higher until, when it rushes on the shore, it may have attained a height of 50 feet or more.\" Yet though an earthquake Avave thus does little or no injury to a ship out at sea, the crew of a vessel floating over or near the point Avhere the \" seismic vertical \" reaches the surface \u2014 or the \" epicentrum,\" as it has been termed \u2014 feel a sensation usually de scribed as if their craft had struck a rock. Instances are knoAvn in Avhich the ship has been dismasted or her seams opened by the Uoav. It is therefore not improbable that some vessels which have mysteriously7 dis appeared have been overAvhelmed by such calamities, what we knoAv of the effect of submarine earthquakes being sufficient to show that escape from this final disaster must in not a few cases have been impossibles These facts regarding earthquake waves hold generally true regarding most parts of the world in Avhich they have been experi enced. In the Mediterranean Avaves have been felt Avith a force not quite so great as on the shores of countries bordering the At lantic or Pacific, though, OAving to the denser population of these regions, Avith a loss of life and property even greater.

During the Quito earth quake of February 4th, 1797 \u2014 the centre of Avhich seems to have been the Tunguragua Volcano \u2014 Riobamba, and all towns within an area of 120 miles north and south and 60 miles east and Avest of the mountain Avere destroyed ; while at Tunguragua and in the immediate vicinity Humboldt tells us that enormous rifts were formed, from which issued volumes of Avater and evil-smelling mud, Avhich in places formed lakes of con siderable magnitude. During the South American earthquake of February 20th, 1835, Avhich more especially affected Chili, though it Avas felt as far as Mendoza, on the eastern side of the Andes, and the Island of Juan Fernandez in the west, the ground in the Island of Quiriquina was in many parts fissured in north and south lines, some of the fissures being a yard in Avidth. Mr. Dar win, who examined the scene of this earth quake soon after it had occurred, describes the effect of the vibration on the hard primary slate which composes the foundation of the island, as shiA7ering some of the narroAv ridges as completely as if their surfaces had been blasted by gunpowder. But this effect, he thinks, must be confined to near the surface, since otherwise there would not exist a block of solid rock throughout Chili. \" Nor is this improbable, as it is knoAvn that the surface of a vibrating body is affected differently from the central part. It is, perhaps, OAving to this same reason that earthquakes do not cause quite such terrific havoc within deep mines as Avould be expected. I believe this convulsion has been more effectual in lessening the size of the island of Quiriquina than the ordinary wear and tear of the sea and weather during the course of a whole century.\" In Chios and Ischia, as Avell as in Andalusia, various places were riven in this manner ; and during the Charleston earthquake of 1886 many gashes were formed, and in spots Avhere the soil Avas very deep, \" spring-holes \" filled Avith Avater appeared. In places Avhere the fissures run across the beds of rivers, the current will naturally tumble into, and either Aoav for a time underground, or, beginning by Avidening the gap, gradually Avear aAvay one wall of it until a lake is formed, and then possibly a waterfall like that of Niagara or the less famous one of the Zambesi will appear. This actually happened in the Mississippi valley, when the rents caused by the earthquake of 1811-12 were so enlarged by torrents as to become a regular valley or ravine ; and in New Zealand there are cracks formed by modern earth quakes extending in one case sixty and in another ninety miles, Avhile in India there is a fissure, or rather a series of fissurings, Avhich have been traced for an even greater distance. Levelling of Cliffs, etc. \u2014 The toppling over of chimneys and the collapse of houses, cala mitous though they are to the owners and occupants, are, of course, geologically of no importance. In a few years the buildings are erected better and more substantial than before, until it requires accurate local knoAV ledge to point to any trace of the destruction Avhich occupied so large a space in the con temporary accounts of the shocks. But Avhen the earthquake throws down cliffs and the pinnacles formed by the erosion of soft rocks by the weather, the result is different. Hence, when the geologist comes upon rocks deli cately poised upon each other (p. 91), or upon \"natural bridges,\" like that of Virginia, or on pinnacles like that in the Canon of the Kentucky River (Kentucky), the Pinnacle Rock in Cumberland Gap, and the \" Navaho * \"A Full Account of the late Dreadful Earthquake at Port Royal, in Jamaica,\" etc. (1692)."], [259, "CHANGES CAUSED BY EARTHQUAKES. 247 Church\" Pinnacled Rocks,* he may safely infer that this particular region at least has never been shaken by any earthquakes of great violence. In this way we can presage something regarding the seismic history of regions even Avhere Avritten chronicles and oral traditions are silent on the subject. It is also quite within the limits of cautious observation to deduce certain facts regard ing the course of earthquakes from the cracks, etc., Avhich they have formed in the soil, in the superficial rocks, or in substantial buildings. During the Agram earthquake of November 9th, 1880, such facts Avere very carefully noted. In Styria, Herr Ra dinsky von Wies, the \" Berg-Director,\" relates, in confirmation of a fact already on record, that Avhile no signs of the seismic wave were noticeable in the mines of Brunn and Schonegg at a depth of 100 feet below the surface, higher up the strata were so affected that the Avorkmen Avho were in the shaft at a depth of from 200 to 400 feet Avere in danger from the fall of the Upper Tertiary rocks above them. This, like so many other earthquakes, seems to have had a more or less rotatory motion. Near the toAvn of Agram are \u2014 as the inscription relates \u2014 the graves of George and Peter Friedhofen. But, after the earthquake, the foundation of the tombs was found to have been upheaved, and the grave stones violently broken across and dislocated, so that the stones, Avhich were originally in a direct line from north to west, had been turned round from 10\u00b0 to 25\u00b0. The staircase of the Cathedral ToAver also was twisted in an arc on its axis, so that the deviation amounted to about tAvo inches. Landslips are common during earthquakes. In 1885 one village in Granada Avas moved bodily some sixty feet in a northAvard direction, a deep semi-circular fis sure \u2014 or \" crevasse \" \u2014 appearing on its former site, and at Periana a landslip on a mountain in the neighbourhood destroyed a church and 750 houses. to, an earthquake, is only what might be inferred from Avhat Ave already know regard ing the action of forces evidently more or less identical with those Avhich cause earthquake shocks For example, the sIoav secular rise and fall of regions cannot but be regarded as of much the same nature as an earth quake, though the agents engaged in this elevation and depression are of a far less sudden character, and do their Avork after a less violent manner. Again, a volcano fre quently causes a change of level in the part of the country immediately affected by it, though volcanic cones are not due to any direct elevating poAver of the outburst. During the eruption of Vesuvius in 1861, the shore in the vicinity of Torre del Greco was elevated over 3\u00a3 feet. After an earth quake also the ground is frequently loAvered below its old level, or considerably raised above Avhat it was before that event. The most familiar instance of this is the oft quoted one of the Ullah Bund, a tract of country in the Delta of the Indus, which, after the convulsion of 1819, Avas raised throughout an area 50 miles, and in some places 16 miles broad, to a maximum height of 10 feet, while- the Runn of Cutch, an area of 2,000 square miles, became at the same time an inland sea, so deep that the fort and village of Sindree sank till only the tops of the houses appeared above the Avater. After the earthquake of 1855 a tract of country in NeAv Zealand Avas seen to have been elevated nine feet for a distance of 90 miles. At the same time the north side of Cook's Strait \u2014 betAveen the North and Southern Islands \u2014 was elevated five feet, AA-hile the southern shore of the same passage Avas depressed to a corresponding degree. During the Calabrian earthquake of 1783 the tOAA-n of Terranuova Avas violently dis turbed. Houses Avere raised above their former levels : others were depressed below the line of the street; while, as not unfre quently happens during earthquakes, buddings above ground displayed \"faults\" in their walls \u2014 that is, one portion of the wall was shifted up, Avhile another was lowered, as Changes of Level.\u2014 That the ground would be elevated or depressed during, or subsequent * These are all figured in Professor Shaler's paper already quoted."], [260, "248 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. we see in the rocks on the two sides of the dislocations, which we have already learned to knoAv under that name (p. SO). An area, 60 miles square, Avas depressed near Chittagong during the Bengal earthquake of 1762, so that the sea invaded the country, leaving only the highest eminence visible above the flood ; and in the Basin of the Mississippi, particularly in 1822, 1835, and 1837, has of late, along witb other phenomena of a kindred character, been questioned.* But, though not improbably some of the data so frequently cited may have been erroneously interpreted, it is idle to deny the many facts in support of the old assertions. After the earthquake of November 19th, 1882, shore.shell fish, still adhering to the rocks, along Fig. 121.\u2014 THE RUE PARTONO, MENTONE, DAMAGED BY THE RIVIERA EARTHQUAKE (1S87). the State of Missouri, in the earthquakes of 1811-12, there was depression of the ground in many places to such an extent that the river formed lakes, where a fe\\v days before dry land \u2014 farms and forest \u2014 had been seen. About five thousand square miles Avere more or less lowered, and such an area of cultivated or settled ground Avas converted into morass that the Government Avas compelled to fur nish hundreds of thousands of acres of new lands in higher grounds to those Avhose farms had become untenable. The sudden elevation of the Chilian coast after the earthquakes of with multitudes of other dead marine animals, were found at a height of from three to four feet above the sea level for a long distance along the Chilian coast. After the shocks of the 20th February, 1835, parts of the coast were raised from four to five feet, but in a few hours it sank till it Avas only two feet above its normal level. Admiral Fitzroy, who was on the spot at the time, found an even more remarkable state of matters on the neighbour ing island of Santa Maria. \" It appears,\" he tells us, \" that the southern extremity of the * Suess : \" Das antlitz der erde.\" Abteilung I. (1883>"], [261, "CHANGES CAUSED BY EARTHQUAKES. 249 island had been raised 8 feet, the middle 9, and the northern extremity upAvards of 10 feet. On steep rocks, where vertical measures could be correctly taken, beds of dead mussels were found ten feet above high Avater mark. An extensive rocky flat lies around the northern parts of Santa Maria. Before the earthquake this flat Avas covered by the sea, about forty miles north of Rome, the church of Jenne, which a century ago Avas invisible from Subiaco, is noAv plainly seen over the summit of the intervening mountains. But though it is clear that there must have been a rise in that interval of the ground on Avhich the church is built, it is, like the corresponding facts regarding the Temple of Serapis, an Fig. 122. \u2014 THE RUE DEBRAY, NICE. DAMAGED BY THE RIVIERA EARTHQUAKE (1SS7). some projecting rocks only showing themselves. Now the whole flat is exposed, and square acres of it are covered with dead shell fish, the stench arising from Avhich is abominable.\" Many facts of a like nature could be cited. The classical ones connected Avith the Temple of Jupiter Serapis have been already fully gone into when discussing secular rise and fall, though the elevation and depression of that monument of pagan superstition and geo logical history are usually regarded as due to convulsions more sudden than those to Avhich we attributed them (p. 172). At Subiaco, open question whether the elevation ln'.s been due to a sIoav oscillatory movement or to a sudden start, such as Ave have so often seen folloAvs or accompanies earthquakes. In Ni apu, one of the Tonga Islands in the Pacific, there are frequent and violent earthquakes, during one of which \u2014 in 1861 \u2014 a consider able part of the island, Avith a populous vil lage, disappeared. In 1878, during a volcanic eruption, a small island was upheaved off the coast of NeAv Britain \u2014 a case Avhich is quite paralleled by an event of a later date (p. 167).* * Romilly : \" The Western Pacific \" (13S6), p. 145."], [262, "250 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. Finally, not to multiply such instances of upheaval and depression, the Moors declare that all the ports of Morocco have been changed for the worse since the Lisbon earth quake, the bars of rivers like those on the banks of Avhich Larache, Azimoor, Sallee, and Rabat are built being shoaler ; and it is certain that the docks of the Roman station at \" Old tion and depression of strata, besides origi nating cracks, dislocations, and the fissures of various forms and dimensions already de scribed.

During the earthquake of 1747 the velocity of the shock \u2014 the \" moto suc cusorio\" of the Italian geologists \u2014 was so great that at Riobamba, at the foot of Chim borazo, corpses Avere thrown out of their graves ; and at Quito, in the same region, Humboldt tells us that on the 4th of Feb ruary, 1797, the \" explosive movement was such as is produced by the firing of a mine, and the bodies of several of the inhabitants were throAvn upon the hill of La Cullca, which rises on the other side of the Lican torrent \" \u2014 or 100 feet of vertical projection, which would, according to the calculations of Mallet, give a velocity of shock equal to 80 feet per second. At Port Royal, in Jamaica, on the 7th June, 1692, the people in the market-place Avere tossed into the air, falling in the water of the neighbouring harbour. In the north of Jamaica, during the same catastrophe, above 1,000 acres of land sunk and thirteen people with it, and hard by the earth \"gaped pro digiously,\" so that the planters' houses, people, and trees, Avith much of their plantations, Avere SAvalloAved up \"all in one gape,\" the place being soon occupied by a lake. This in its turn dried up, nothing being seen except loose sand and gravel, \" Avithout any the least mark or sign left whereby one may judge that either a tree, house, or anything else had ever stood there.\"* On the 28th of March, 1783, some of the attendants of Sir William Hamilton noticed the granite rocks of Calabria dancing up and doAvn, so that the highest points seemed to be in a state of commotion; and it is well ascer tained that the most violent earthquakes have been those Avhich produced the eleva- Disturbance of Drainage. \u2014 It is, indeed, a natural sequence to what has been said re garding the disturbance of the strata that there should be a corresponding interference Avith the drainage. Accordingly, Ave find that almost every earthquake of any severity is folloAved by the drying up of old springs and the bursting forth of new ones, by the damming up of rivers and the formation of lakes, and, it is affirmed in more than one case, by the eruption of geysers long silent ; Avhile it is well established that in Iceland several of the spouting fountains noAv active appeared after a volcanic convulsion accompanied by an earthquake, and that several have disappeared in such close sequence to the like events, that Ave are justified in classing them as cause and effect. In any case, it is rare that streams are not temporarily affected by the passage of an earthquake wave. Sometimes their volume decreases, or their current altogether ceases for a time to flow, or, as Ave have already seen (p. 226), the Avater is discoloured by mud, or even rises in temperature. In 1885 many of the sulphur springs Avith which Granada abounds suddenly ceased flowing, and reappeared a day or two after the earth quake in a state of unusual heat. In Cali fornia, during a shock in 1887, some of the hot springs stopped, and cases are on record in Avhich the first symptoms of anything being wrong Avith the under-world were the wells and springs becoming dry. Lakes, we have * Philosophical Transactions, No. 209, p. 89."], [263, "CHANGES CAUSED BY EARTHQUAKES. 251 learned (pp. 248, 250), may occasionally be formed by the loAvering of the level adjacent to a river or the sea ; and Avhen fissures are made in the bed of a lake or the level of its outlet is altered, the basin may be suddenly emptied of its contents. During the Cala brian earthquake of 1783 a new lake, the Lago del Tolfilo, Avas formed by the opening of a great chasm near Seminara ; and, as happened at Charleston and other places, more than one pond arose as the after effects of the shocks. During the Mississippi earth quake of 1812, not only were seA7eral large lakes made, but the inhabitants relate that the ground beloAv New Madrid \" SAvelled so as \u00b0 i to arrest the Mississippi in its course, and to cause a temporary reflux of its waves.\" spots, in addition to the sand and water, \" an unfamiliar substance of an oily pasty cha racter, like the juice from a squeezed orange,\" was expelled. After these ejections ceased, mounds, like the cones of mud vulcanoes, remained, so that not improbably they Avere really of this nature. The waters in the wells rose and fell. A raihvay train approaching Charleston at the moment of the shock pitched like a ship at sea ; then, by a change in the direction of the wave, the cars were throAvn against the opposite sides of the track. The roadAvay Avas upheaved, and the rails Avere bent into reverse curves. The tales of shoAvers of pebbles falling in different localities Avith intervals of three or four hours betAveen them, have been repeated Avith so much circumstantiality that Ave are compelled to give some degree of credence to the reports. The size of the stones is said to have varied from that of a grape to that of a hen's egg, and to have fallen perpendicularly, Avith force enough to fracture the hard pave ments upon which they struck. These stones had polished surfaces, and felt warm Avhen handled directly after falling ; but though it is quite possible, from Avhat has been said on p. 250, that such stones Avere ejected into the air and fell, it does not necessarily folloAv that they Avere discharged out of the ground. Nor are the stories of flames having been seen to issue from the cracks Avell authenticated,* and in the same category Avas thought to come the tale of a volcano having broken out on the slope of the Sierra Madre Mountains, fourteen miles south-east of Bavispe, in Sonora, during the earthquake shocks Avhich lasted for the most of May, 1887. At first this supposed volcano was affirmed to be only a mountain fire. But later intelligence affirms its exist ence, and that streams of lava Aoav down the sides of the mountain. During the Mississippi valley earthquakes of 1811-12, the inhabitants During the Arizona earthquake of 1887 the ground near Benson opened to a Avidth of six inches, and Avater rose in hitherto dry places. At a distance of ten miles from Tombstone, a lake covering an acre Avas completely dried up in ten minutes, and in the Santa Catalina mountains the \" canons \" (deep defiles) were reported to be full of Avater, OAving to the streams being dammed up. During the Calabrian earthquake of 1783 about fifty new lakes are said to have been formed by the temporary obstruction of the rivers and brooks, and in Chili, as in other countries, the current of streams is often altered, owing to the slope of their beds being increased or diminished, while, OAving to the same cause, neAv channels are sometimes formed, and the fertility of the country affected by this inter ference Avith the drainage, Avhich has been changed either tor the Avorse or the better. During the Charleston earthquake, it Avas reported in the contemporary accounts that from the fissures formed sulphurous fumes arose, and that, as at Lisbon (p. 246), in some places \u2014 several miles from the city \u2014 these ex uded sand, white in some places, and red in others. From other openings, brackish tepid water spouted to the height of from fifteen to tAventy feet, a fact Avhich accords Avith the eruption of sulphur-water, sand, and mud, to the height of 30 feet during the earthquake of 1766 at Cumana, in Venezuela.

The enormous pressure from different sides, and the strain of the moving rock masses, the forming of new and the enlargement of already existing cracks and fissures in the strata \u2014 in a word, any sudden disturbance in the ar rangement of the beds of rock \u2014 is, of course, sufficient to produce these dislocations or tectonic earthquakes. They occur very frequently, stretch very far, and are bound to folloAv certain lines (the seismic hnes), which might be indicated as the lines of shock. Such earthquakes might be called linear ones, in contrast to those which pro ceed from or are due to volcanic disturbance, or to some internal explosion, from which the tremor waves spread outward. All moun tainous localities, but especially mountain ranges, and particularly the side of their range Avhich is turned towards the sea, are more or less liable to this kind of earthquake. Such a locality is called a District of Shocks \u2014 or, as the Germans say, an \" Erschiitterungs gebiete,\" or, more shortly, a \" Schtittergebiete.\" Some of these we have already described in considering the geographical distribution oi the seismic zones. Of all these earthquake harassed regions the slope of the Cordilleras facing the Pacific is one of the most cha racteristic. Scarcely a year passes Avithout a catastrophe. Lima, the capital of Peru, has been eleven times shattered since the beginning of the sixteenth century. In Asia it is Syria, Asia Minor, Persia, the slope of the Himalayas, and the valley of the Indus, Avhich are es pecially exposed. In Europe Ave have seen that it is the Spanish Peninsula, Italy, Avith the Apennines and the region of the Alps, which are chiefly disturbed. From 1850 to 1857, 1,086 earthquakes have been noted in the Alps alone ; but of these only 81 Avere in the Eastern Alps. That so large a proportion falls to the Western Alps is, however, possibly due to the fact that the shocks have been more carefully noted in the Eastern ranges. No part of the Alps is quite free from them. But the most intense disturbances are in the relate that the \" earth rose in great undula tions, and when these reached a certain fearful height the soil burst, and vast volumes of water, sand, and pit coal, were discharged as high as the tops of the trees.\"* Dislocation of Strata. \u2014 It is equally cer tain, no matter how earthquakes are pro duced, that whenever there is either an elevation or a depression of the surface fault ing must result, since a bed or series of beds could not possibly be raised or loAvered Avith out suffering dislocation of the character we have afready fully described (pp. 79-82).

But apart from theory, Avhich in this case is founded on so firm a basis as scarcely to be distinguished from absolute fact, more than one modern earthquake have furnished data amply suffi cient to confirm what has been thus inferred. During a severe earthquake in New Zealand in 1855, an area of country, comprising 4,600 square miles, Avas permanently elevated to a maximum height of 9 feet, while the adjoining plain of Wairaraka Avas not raised at all, the result being a line of fault or dislocation traceable along the base of the Rimutaka Range for a distance of 90 miles, t It is, indeed, considered by many Conti nental geologists \u2014 whose experience is derived from a study of Swiss and South German earthquakes \u2014 that the most destructive shocks are those Avhich are closely connected with the formation of mountain chains.

The Belluno earthquake of June 29th, 1873, Avhich did so much damage to the town and neighbourhood, afforded several good examples of this kind of disturbance. It Avas very care fully studied by Vom Rath, Bittner, and Homes, and it Avould appear from a diagram prepared by the latter geologist (Fig. 125) that the line of shock coincides Avith the transverse dislocation of St. Croce, Avhich latter is at the same time plainly the division betAveen two mountain masses moving horizontally from each other. southern part of the Cadoric, Carnic, and Dinaric Alps, bordering the Adriatic. This district is generally called the earthquake zone of the Southern and South-eastern Alps. The latest researches of the Austrian geolo gists (Suess, Stur, Bittner, Hofer, and Homes) upon the seismology of the Alps and Apen nines tend to shoAv that the lines of shock in these earthquakes are indicated by the lines of disturbance in the formation of the moun tain ranges, as these coincide, in part at least, with the earthquakes across the ranges, and partly Avith those in a longitudinal direction. * We find a district of frequent and severe dis turbances along the inside of the Eastern Alps on the north-east coast of the Adriatic. To this district belong the frequent earth quakes of Northern Italy, and the edge of the Southern Alps tOAvards the Lombardo- Venetian Plain, and also the earthquakes in the Plateau of the Karst. These disturbances can be recognised as extending from the Lago di Garda over the region in Avhich are situated Ala, Schio, Bassano, Asolo, Belluno, and Maniago to Tagliamento. ' At Udine, Avhich in 1384 Avas the scene of one of the greatest earthquakes knoAvn to history, the line of disturbance turns tOAvards the south-east. Noav come the earthquake regions of Gormons, Gorz, Gradisca, Adelsberg, and then that of Klana in the coast country, Avhich in 1870 was disturbed by a series of shocks ; and at last Ave reach that of Fiume. After this Ave can folloAv the region of disturbances into the Istrio-Dalmatian Karst, as shoAvn on the annexed map (Fig. 123). As transverse lines of shock there may also be pointed out the line running from Trient, Botzen, Brixen ; that from Venice, Raibl, Villach (the ceurse of the earthquake of 1384t); that from Trieste, Laibach, Cilli, and others (Fig. 123), from all of Avhich the shock has often been felt far into the recesses of the Alps, as well as in the outlying branches. These data are of course intended to illus trate only one theory of the cause of earth quakes, or the way in Avhich one particular class of them is caused, namely, by the sinking and crushing of strata. Suess will, hoAvever, maintain that in other regions of the Avorld besides that which he has studied, the con nection of the earth Avith these tectonic lines can be recognised. The terrible Calabrian catastrophe of 1783 is a case in point. It moved along the inner fault line of Aspro monte, Avhich coincides Avith the periphery of the Calabrian mountains. In studying the earthquakes of Central Germany, Von Seebach came to the conclusion that the seat of these Avas most likely a fault, Avhich ran nearly from north-north-Avest to south-south-east but had only a very slight horizontal expanse, and in the east-north-east penetrated far into the crust of the earth.

Besides these peripheral or circum-montane lines of disturbance, there are numerous radial or transverse lines of shock coinciding with similar lines of dislocation.

As this is the beginning of the new year, it has become an article of belief among many of the natives that the year cannot really begin until an earthquake has been felt, and it is said that some Sarts even stick a knife slightly into the ground, and do not celebrate the neAv year's feast until the knife has been stricken doAvn* Fig. 125. \u2014 FAULT AND LINE OF THE EARTHQUAKE OF ST.

This notion is, however, held by theorists more scientific than the excited people Avho fill the newspapers with their vain imaginings regard ing the causes which led to the catastrophe. There are, indeed, writers as Avorthy of re spect as Mr. Proctor Avho hold that \" the changes of atmosphere and oceanic pressure are potent factors in the production of earth quakes, and are probably, in the greater number of cases, their direct occasion ; \" while, on the other hand, the observations of numerous students in Europe and America go far to shoAv that the state of the AA7eather has no more to do Avith a shock in the earth's crust than a \" fall in Eries \" or the price of consols the day before. Between these extremes there is room for every variety of opinion to be held. she is on the meridian than at the times and seasons Avhen she is not in those positions relatively to the earth.\" The inference drawn from this is, that the same cause Avhich pro duces tides acts on the solid crust of the earth, and therefore induces a strain on the rocks composing it. But, unfortunately for the soundness of these views and the deduc tion from them, neither they nor the ideas of Schmidt* \u2014 that shocks occur most frequently in January, when the earth is nearest the sun, and least frequently in July, when it is farthest from that luminary \u2014 are quite borne out by observations in other parts of the Avorld. In Japan, for example, the seasons of maxima and minima are entirely different, and in Cali fornia the autumn months are believed to be the ones most often disturbed by these dis agreeable visitors, while the summer months are those Avhich are least seldom disturbed; though in California, as in Europe, January bas always proved a month of maximum fre quency. In Japan also, though the periods of maxima and minima do not coincide with those of Europe, Dr. Knott admits that earth quakes are in those islands relatively more frequent in winter than in summer, and con nects this Avith the fact that during Avinter the average barometric gradient across Japan is much steeper than in summer, which. coupled Avith the piling up of snow in the northern regions, may possibly \" give rise to long-continued stresses, tending to produce movements of the earth's crust.\" This sug gestion has some support in knoAvn facts. * \" Studen iiber Erdbeben \" (1879), pp. 18-20.

The mythology of almost every nation has been busy with devising tales to account for these movements of the subterranean world. In Mongolia they are attributed to the heavings of a huge frog in the interior of the earth ; in China a great dragon is blamed ; in India there is a world-bearing elephant in voked to explain them ; in Celebes a hog takes the place of the elephant ; and among some of the South American tribes a tortoise is credited with producing the tremors. A Avorld-supporting bull is in other regions pressed into service. In Siberia earthquakes are set doAvn to the trampling of mammoths that five underground, and in Kamtchatka they are regarded as the scratchings of certain flea-pestered dogs, Avhich attend the god Tuil on his walks. On the western shores of Van couver Island \u2014 a part of America in which mild earthquakes are frequent*\u2014 the Indians regard earthquakes with peculiar dread. During one which some friends of the writer experienced, the savages who belonged to the expedition set up a fearful yell, which they con tinued until all the white men of the party had come out of their tent. They then begged them to fire their guns in order to frighten away the spirit of evil, who, according to their mythology, comes upon the earth, at this particular time, Avith all the Indians who have ever died, to slay the living for the evil they have com mitted. The rumbling noise they attribute to the tramp of the imaginary host. And here I may add that the close connection which the aborigines trace between the earthquakes of this region and the eruption of the volcanoes in the Cascade Range, is borne out by certain facts within my OAvn knowledge. After a The Japanese, also, have their seismic my thology. One of their oldest legends ascribes them tc the movements of a creature called Jishin-mushni \u2014 \" the earthquake insect \"\u2014 having an oblong, scaly body, ten legs, feet like spiders', and the head of a dragon. On this, however, at a place called Kashima, rests the Kaname rock, with Avhich it is the duty of the Kami, or deity of the district, to keep the creature as quiet as possible. Hence the old earthquake couplet : \u2014 \" No monster can move the Kaname rock, Though he tug at it never so hard, For over it stands, resisting the shock, The Kashima-Kami on guard.\" A legend of later origin makes the Jishin mushni a monstrous cat-fish, t These, and a score of similar myths, more or less unrelated to anything in the phenomena themselves, have invested earthquakes with a horror even greater than their actual calamity is capable of inspiring.

This continual, ever-present, never ending dread of the earthquake, has coloured the lives of the races subject to it, and, it may be, has so imprinted itself on the minds of primitive man as to generate many of those \" Nature myths \" over which so much ink has been shed. It must also have tinged his poetry and his religion, and imprinted itself on his art and his mode of life. How far the classic faith of the Greeks and Romans was influenced by it, Vulcan, Pluto, and Enceladus, are in proof, but it may also be found that the bizarre art of Japan OAves as much to the earthquake legends of her people, as the happy-go-lucky disposition of the Neapolitans does to the fact that with the sight of Vesuvius ever before their eyes, and the legends of buried cities never absent from their memories, they find it hard to spend thoughts over the morrow, since providence availed not the citizens of Herculaneum and Pompeii. quakes Avere regarded as the means adopted by Providence for punishing a sinful Avorld, there Avas never any great difficulty in playing the prophet ; for the world is always ready enough for the divine rod * and if one is only patient the rod is sure to arrive. For instance, the earthquake Avhich in 1682 almost entirely demolished Lima, was said to have been fore told by a friar of the Order of La Merced, who several days before ran along the streets, bke another Jonah, crying, \" Repent ! Repent ! for the end of all things is at hand.\" Again, that of 1746 was affirmed \u2014 after it was over \u2014 to have been prophesied by \" our Mother Teresa\" of Jesus, in the convent of the Bare footed Sisters of St. Joseph ; and one which began in Canada on the 5th of February, 1663, and continued till July 12th of the same year, \"occasioning incredible alterations on the surface of the land for above 400 leagues,\" seemed \u2014 if Ave are to credit certain hints in the memoirs of an Ursuline nun of NeAv France, published in 1677 \u2014 to have been, months before it happened, in the knoAvledge of certain good people, who, however, do not appear \u2014 like Parthenios, the monk of Chios, who loudly proclaimed an earthquake on a definite day in 1881 \u2014 to have benefited themselves by their exclusive information At the same time, while not for a moment admitting that these amateur \" haruspices \" had any basis for the prophetic superstructures which they reared.t it Avould be unfair to affirm that they were attempting to deceive.

In Peru and Prophecies.\u2014 But of all the outcomes of the superstition engendered by earthquakes, the eagerness for prophesying their arrival is the most remarkable. That men Avould like to be able to forecast such calamities is only natural. But how any one can imagine that in the present state of our knowledge this is possible, is not so easily to be understood or ac counted for. Yet it seldom happens, after a more than usually violent shock, that some one does not claim the distinction of having foretold it, or that some more or less vague allusion to the coming event is not disinterred from the pages of an astrological almanac ; though in no case can these soothsayers explain hoAv this, among their many other prophecies, became true, when ninety-nine of a hundred similar attempts to peer into futurity proved entirely futile.

Indeed, most people Avho have lived in a seismic region, even when scoffing at all pretensions of this nature, admit that often before a shock they have had forebodings, in spite of themselves, that a calamity was at hand. A sensation of lassitude and depression is the most common feeling experienced, and even Mr. Milne \u2014 who is one of the last men to encourage any ab surdity in the shape of \" prophecies \" \u2014 admits that he has on several occasions been so im pressed by7 these premonitory symptoms in his own person, as to have his instruments in readiness to observe the shock. This, Iioav ever, he attributes to \"nervous expectancy,\" due to the knowledge that, as there had been no earthquake for several weeks, one was due at any7 moment. In Caracas, hoAvever, dogs, cats, and jerboas are affirmed to become restless prior to an earthquake, and before the first shock in the Riviera in February, 1887, a groom observed the strange uneasiness of his horses, Avhich laid their ears back and refused to be comforted. In Chili immense flocks of sea-birds have been observed to fly inland just before a severe shock, and in 1835, all the dogs escaped from the city of Talcahuano in anticipation of the earthquake of that date.* These may have been coincidences. Birds fly inland and cats are uneasy when there are no earthquakes to justify their movements, though, on the other hand, the loAver animals are singularly sensitive to any change of Aveather, to pressure of the air, and may eA7en be conscious of subterranean move ments Avhich do not come within human ken, or are even not detectable by the most delicate instruments. Especially after a great shock the panic* stricken population are always ready to listen to any quack, no matter Iioav silly or how knavish. In 1750, after the London tremors in the spring of that year, when, according to Horace Walpole, \"the earth had a shivering fit,\" pills Avere sold \" as good against an earth quake,\" and a crazy lifeguardsman predicted a third and more fatal shock with such influ ence, that, as the time fixed for the catas trophe drew nigh, the roads leading out of London were blocked with the carriages of panic-stricken people clearing out of town- Many of the nobility sat in their coaches all night in Hyde Park. \" Earthquake gOAvns \"\u2014 warm garments to wear while sitting out of doors \u2014 Avere greatly in request, and certain aristocratic ladies went ten miles out of Lon don on the fatal night, returning in the morning someAvhat disappointed that the 5th of April had passed without the soldier's prophecy having been fulfilled. Seers of this order are never wanting, and after the Riviera earthquake some people made clamorous pretensions to public esteem from having \" foretold \" what they could not possibly have had any knowledge of and never tried to guard against. But the quasi-scientific prophets are barely preferable. The theorists who connect almost every human misfortune, from an Indian famine to the potato disease, with the greater or less spottedness of the sun, have not failed to point out that some relation might be traced between the convul sions under the soil and those dark spaces in the orb of day, though, it is perhaps needless to say, in every case altogether without success. M. Delauney, finding that in Perrey's cata logue \u2014 a very incomplete one at best \u2014 there Avere certain terms of years marked by a comparative absence of earthquakes, tried to find an explanation for this real or fancied periodicity in the movements of other celestial bodies. This, he believed, he had discovered in the fact that the epochs of maximum seismic energy coincided with cer tain phases of Jupiter and Saturn, and that these periods of earthquake frequency are identical with the passage of the Earth and The success of the earthquake prophet is generally out of all proportion to his merits. * Murray's Magazine, June, 1887, pp. 813\u2014822, where Mr. Westwood Oliver discusses in a most satisfactory manner the various earthquake prophecies which come Avithin the range of reason."], [273, "PLANETARY INFLUENCE ON EARTHQUAKES 261 the planets in question through the meteoric streams Avhich are known as the Perseids and Leonids (August and November shoAvers).

Moreover, the data upon Avhich the theory is formulated relate to only a small portion of the globe, while, if there is any thing in it, its application would be Avorld wide. Altogether, M.

He \" foretold \" the Belluno earthquake of June 28th, 187.3, and, though his failures have been numerous and notorious, he once more rose into esteem by prophesying the Riviera disaster, though, it may be added, his vaticinations as to shocks Avhich were to folloAv this calamity, founded on a perfect parity of reasoning Avith the former one, Avere con spicuously7 unsuccessful. Falb's theory is that the interior of the earth being bquid, the attraction of the sun and moon, which, as is knoAvn, causes tides in the ocean, compels this liquid mass to ebb and floAv up the rifts Avhich he supposes exist in the interior surface of the covering crust, \"just like the sea in our bays and estuaries. When the hot matter enters the solid and comparatively cold channels in the earth's crust it is rapidly cooled, and ex plosions of gas and subterranean A7olcanic disturbances result. The violence of these phenomena Avhich this best-reputed of the earthquake prophets regards as essential to the success of his vaticinations would not exist. And, above all, though the pull of the sun and moon may cause a certain strain on . the earth's crust or substance, it is entirely unproved that anything like tides is formed ; and, if these tides did exist, then they must be regular like the oceanic tides, and, of course, the earthquake phenomena Avould share in this steady periodicity \u2014 a circum stance Avhich, it is perhaps unnecessary to remark, does \"not hold true regarding them. Nor does the often-repeated argument that, though the theories of MM. Delauney and Falb may be scientifically unsound, their re sults have been remarkably correct, help them much. Earthquakes are so frequent in many parts of the earth \u2014 and, taking the Avorld at large, so continuous \u2014 that it is no merit to be able to foretell their occurrence in any one year. The only claim to distinc tion arises from the ability of the seer to say that those of any particular year will be more or less severe, or that one may be ex pected to occur at some fixed date. All that M. Delauney affects to have been able to ac complish was to foretell those of 1883 and 1886. But even this shadoAvy lustre is dulled by the fact that, while he predicted 1883 to be an ordinary year, he confidently declared that 1886 would be one of great intensity as re gards its seismic commotion, Avhile the very reverse turned out to be the case. Falb's theory is more sound \u2014 taking prophetic soundness as the standard \u2014 though it also must, from the circumstances stated, be largely helped out by one or tAvo happy coincidences in a field where such coinci dences are likely to be frequent. Tidal strain as the cause of earthquakes is out of the question. \" As the facts stand,\" and I quote the words of Professor Milne because they express in a single sentence the only con clusions tenable, \" it appears that the maxi mum pulls exerted by the moon and the sun are only sufficient to cause a slight pre ponderance in the number of earthquakes felt at particular seasons, and, therefore, that phenomena depends on the height of the internal tides, and as that, in its turn, de pends upon the relative position and distance at any time of the sun and moon, the Avhole thing may be reduced to calculation, and the earthquakes, Avhich are the external mani festation of the internal phenomena, be fore told Avith the exactitude of an eclipse.\" This hypothesis, it will be seen, is based on a very unstable foundation, for it takes for granted ascertained facts Avhat are only as sumptions by no means universally accepted. For instance, though the probabilities are in favour of the earth having a molten interior, this is not in any degree proved, and, as we have seen (p. 84), is by many physicists stoutly contested. As for the fissures in the crust into Avhich the fluid matter ebbs and Aoavs, these are mere inventions. Nothing in the history of the earth justifies Dr. Falb in evolving them from \" the depths of his inner consciousness.\" Moreover, as Mr. Oliver very properly points out, if the supposed molten matter Avas constantly floAving into and harden ing in these supposed fissures, they Avould soon fill up and disappear.

This, to some extent, so far as the avoidance of valleys is concerned, holds good of the volcanic region of the Rhine and Moselle. Stromboli, we haA7e seen, is almost a baro meter to the seafaring men of the Eastern Mediterranean, and Etna and Vesuvius haA7e been more frequently in eruption during spring and Avinter than at any other season. Finally-, HaAvaiian residents are inclined to think that great eruptions of the A-olcanoes with the ac companying earthquakes of these islands are sometimes preceded by Avet weather. But this supposed fact has never been confirmed. Nor is. there any ground for believing that few sun spots and diminished magnetic disturbances, or the occurrence of the August meteors, have the slightest connection with the greater or less degree of volcanic intensity. Earthquake warnings, are therefore not pos sible in the present state of our knoAvledge. At best, they are only fortunate guesses and accidental coincidences, and the most pre tentiously scientific of the order are not better based than the weird warnings of Zadkiel's Almanac, or of the professional astrologer whom the city of Lima used to maintain, and who \u2014 after the event \u2014 shoAved to the satis faction of himself, if not of his patrons, that the great catastrophe of October 28th, 1746, Avas due at the time it happened.

A time may come Avhen we may predict the weather underground with not much more error than that Avith which the Aveather overhead is forecast ; though even when this period arrives it will be no more possible to say months or years in advance whether an earthquake is to occur, than it is to prophesy at a longer interval than twenty-four hours Avhether the sky is to be overcast, the barometer low, or the thermometer high. It has even been attempted to foretell vol canic eruptions. This is, if possible, an idler task than predicting earthquakes. We knoAA7, Precautions against Earthquakes.\u2014 But if we cannot guard against earthquakes by knoAv ing the hour and the manner in Avhich they come, AA7e can at least so put our houses in order that Avhen the inevitable overtakes us the mischief may be reduced to a minimum. The building site should be selected Avith some regard to Avhat experience relates respecting its greater or less immunity from vibrations, since we know that within the limits of a single toAvn one place is often more shaken than another (p. 239). If in any particular region the earth quake shock originates from a single important centre \u2014 as very generally is the case \u2014 then the site should, as far as possible, be selected on the limits of the range of the usual vibra tions, for, as Professor Darwin tells us, just as a high wall, a hill, or a raiLvay cutting often cuts off sounds by forming a \" sound-shadow,\" so a ravine or some arrangement of the geo logical formation may7 afford an \" earthquake"], [276, "264 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. shadow \" for particular spots.

In building, the same admirable investigator con siders that the openings in a Avail ought to be Avere old ones, in bad repair, or still marked by the effect of previous earthquakes. The prehistoric races of Central America and Yucatan seemed to have clearly understood the Avisdom of rearing their houses in such a manner that they might bear the shock of an Fig. 128.

Well-built houses are less liable to destruction than flimsy ones. During the Riviera shocks in 1887 the buildings which suffered most earthquake Avith the minimum of risk. In Uxmal or Palenque, for example, the buildings are enormously massive at the base, sloping gradually from the ground to the eaves on the outside, giving to each structure the appear ance of an abbreviated pyramid.

As a whole, Mr. Milne's observations demon strate that, after experiments at any proposed site, it ought to be possible to arrive at tolerably safe conclusions whether buildings having isolated foundation-Avails or piers, carried up from ascertained depths, as in the case of astronomical instrument piers, may not be rendered safe from earthquake shocks of ordinary intensity, or at least from such of them as have their origin at distances sufficient to render the vibrations practically horizontal. It is interesting to note in connection Avith protection from the numerous canons or defiles in its neighbourhood. In another series of experiments, Mr. Milne sought the besc means of employing the inertia of a building to neutralise earthquake effects. With this object he set to work on a principle first applied by the late Mr. DaA-id Stevenson, in connection Avith the lighthouses of Japan.

Hitherto, in tracing the story of the Earth, we have mainly considered the forces by which it is violently tossed about. But if the volcano and the earthquake, or even the slow secular rise, had all their OAvn Avay, the world would be a world of ruins, of disjecta membra, of jagged rocks, and black lava fields, of deserts instead of fertile valleys and rich corn lands, and forests stretching as far as the eye can see. However, no sooner does the volcano vomit forth the entrails of the earth, or the earthquake rive its skin asunder, than another force, which does its work through many agents, sets to work and clears away the debris, smooths doAvn tbe rough places, covers with a kindly soil the bare lava, and, in brief, \" tidies up things \" so completely, that in a few years all traces of the rude work of the upheaving forces hav7e nearly disappeared. Rounded hills appear in place of angular rocks, the valleys are clothed with turf, vine yards are groAving on the crumbling lava, and com on the soil which was raised out of the sea. This force is that of denudation, or un covering, though in reality it strips the surface simply to enable it to convey the material to the places where it is most needed. It acts through the aerial elements, through rain, through springs, through rivers, through frost and frozen Avater, through the agency of animals and plants, and, when we lea\\7e the surface of the fresh-Avater Avorld, through the sea which thunders on the shores Avhich attempt to defy its inroads. The ocean sends up vapour which falls in the shape of rain. The rain SAveeps over the ground carrying the soil with it, or sinks into the ground, to burst forth again in the form of springs, Avhich bear with them whatever soluble material they have dissolved out of the rocks through Avhich they have passed. In the end, both unite to form rivers which, descending to the lowest levels, join their forces and form floods, which roll to the sea through valleys which they are ever scooping out deeper and deeper. Into the river run mountain torrents laden with mud, which they have conveyed from the uplands as their contribution to the Avork of denudation, or the debris, which, by under mining the rocks so as to form landslips, they * For these recent data we are indebted to a learned Tokio correspondent of the Times, January 7th, 1887."], [279, "GEOLOGICAL WEAR AND TEAR. 267 have dislodged from the hills which to them are mere mounds of dirt to be duly returned to their pristine form of mud and sand. The sea then gains its OAvn again, and stores up in the recesses of its depths the materials Avhich are to be consolidated into rocks and, in the fulness of time, to be raised into the upper air again, to be in their turn attacked and duly demolished by \"the elements,\" whose fives are spent in devouring their children. But the rain in the uplands and in the far north falls in snoAV, and the snoAV forms glaciers, which, grinding their way to the lowlands, bear Avith them the rocks and earth \u2022which they have torn from the side of the valleys through Avhich they have journeyed, and deposit them far from their quondam home ; or borne on the surface of an ic.eberg \u2014 the broken-off end of a glacier which reaches the ocean \u2014 the rock floats to distant regions, until, by the melting of the raft, it is dropped in the bottom of the sea, to be in time ex- posed as a \"travelled block\" perched on a Highland hill, or among the quiet pastures of a New England valley. Or the glacier, grinding like some vast sinuous file over the rocks, erodes into powder the ground over Avhich it passes, which \u2014 washed out from under it in the shape of a Avhite mud \u2014 is deposited at the bottom of the inlet into which the seaward end of the glacier protrudes, or into the Alpine valley, where, the warmth being too much for it, it ends its progress. The wind weathers eA7ery rock it comes in contact with, especially if the Avind is laden with moisture, and still more if it is aided by rain. The plants in search of food devour the soil and split the rocks in their eager search after it, and the coral polyp, ever intent in building up its wondrous reefs, seizes the lime which the rivers have sent into the sea, as the molluscs and other marine animals utilise this material for their shells and bones, in their turn Avhen dead to send it back again to the waters, or to convert it in another form into solid rocks. The sea, ever voracious, is never at rest. Into its hungry maw it sAveeps whatever has been rescued from its depths in the shape of the islands which the coral polyp rears, or the rocks which line its coasts ; or in the North its waters freeze, and in spring do not bid a reluctant fareAvell to the Arctic cliffs Avithout bearing off as their tribute the boulders of earth and stones Avhich the frost has dislodged and landed on the \" ice foot \" below. Thus the world is constantly being sculptured by the hand of Nature. To this Aveathering, added to the volcano and the earthquake, and the secular oscillation, the circulation of matter is due. The remainder of this volume will, therefore, be occupied in considering, as fully as our space will permit, or the necessities of the case demand, the geological agencies thus briefly alluded to, and which, as Ave have shown in the Introduction to this work, play7 so important a part in the ceaseless unrest of the living earth. Compared with the havoc wrought by the volcano and the earthquake, the sIoav, gentle, almost imperceptible wear of \" wind and weather,\" rain and running Avater, may seem insignificant. But, as Ave shall presently learn, in the aggregate they accom plish even more than the forces which strike the eye and impress the imagination more vividly (Fig. 130). Rain and Springs : Formation. When a shower of rain falls on the earth, what is not absorbed by vegetation runs either wholly or in part off\" the surface ; or if the soil is porous and the fall very gentle, it is for the most part absorbed by the thirsty ground. But in neither case is it lost as a geological agent. If the earth is not protected by a dense carpet of vegetation, and, above all, by forest growth, which not only breaks the mechanical action of the heavy tropical doAvn pours, but by forming a spongy carpet of fallen leaves and twigs, allows the water to ooze down as through a sponge, the ground is scored by the rushing rivulets of rain, and the earth and gravel often washed away. On the other hand, if the rain is permitted to quietly sink into the soil, it percolates through the strata, dissolving out in its course whatever is soluble, running doAvn the slope of more im pervious inclined beds, and eventually finding"], [280, "Fig. 130.\u2014 EARTH PILLARS, NEAR KIOTO, SPITI VALLEY, HIMALAYA MOUNTAINS.

Springs. \u2014 This is the simplest form of these familiar accumulations of subterranean Avater.' But it is evident that a spring of this nature must soon run dry. It does not run out quite so rapidly as the rain runs in, and in any case appears long after the surface drought has set in. But it cannot long survive the stoppage of the rainfall Avhich feeds it. If, however, the rain sinks until it reaches a hollow in a rock, it will fill this holloAv before overfloAving, and if the outlet happens to be a crack, the spring continues to flow for a very long period. Such holloAvs are generally the source from whence a pump derives its supply, or into Avhich the in near neighbourhood to each other. But simple though this inference is, it was long held that springs originated from the vapo rised water of the sea, condensed in caverns, or, as Aristotle taught, that their source was due to air condensed into water in subter ranean chambers; it being left to Mariotte and Halley to demonstrate that the fall of Avater in the form of snoAV, rain, and deAv, was sufficient to account for all the water of rivers and springs. Hoav deep Avater penetrates Ave do not know. Probably it sinks until the internal heat of the earth A7aporises it, for the varying tempera ture of springs is evidently due to the fact Avhether in their course to the surface they Fig. 131. \u2014 THE WELLS OF VIENNA. a, Alluvium ; b, Diluvial terraces ; i\u2014f, Infiltration water from the Danube ; t, Calcareous clays (Miocene) \u2014 The \" tegel \" of the Viennese : s, Water bearing sand and gravel ; g, Water accumulating in the hollowed rock. sinker of a draAv-Avell drops after boring doAvn to a varying depth.

In Misnia, in Saxony, w7ater drops from the roof of a mine 1,600 feet deep, and, after prolonged droughts, numerous springs, knoAvn to be deep-seated, either become attenuated or cease to Aoav, but speedily7 revive after heaA7y rain. It is also a fact that where springs exist there is usually higher ground someAvhere in the neighbour hood, from which the water may and probably does Aoav. During the dry season of August and September, 1881, the anthracite miners of Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, had to depend largely7 upon the supply of water found in the mines* The water Avhich passes into the earth finds its way through grooves, clefts, and crevices. But much also works downward by means of capillary attraction. No rock is quite imper vious to Avater, and Avhen the strata or even the unstratified mass in the heart of a moun tain are broken, it is usually found that they are more or less damp, or that moisture can be extracted from them (p. 111). Thus, though some of the materials composing the earth's crust are more pervious to water than others, all eventually give passage to it ; hence the varying capacity of rocks for holding liquid, and the seemingly whimsical nature of springs Amount of Water Discharged. \u2014 The amount of water discharged from springs varies, of * United States Geological Surrey of the Territories, Part IL, 1S7S, p. 357."], [282, "270 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. rocks at a considerable depth which can be reasonably relied upon. Their Avarmth depends on the depth at Avhich they are found. It coincides with the temperature of the rocks which hold the Avater. This permeability of strata by moisture renders shallow wells and springs liable to pollution from sewage, or other impurities which work doAvmvard through the same channels through Avhich the water is conducted, or which the Avater meets Avith in its course through the soil. Cholera, for ex ample, is almost invariably propagated through polluted water. On the other hand, some strata \u25a0 \u2014 such as sand \u2014 filter liquid of any mechanical impurities, though it is impossible for or ganic foulness, such as the germs of disease, to be taken out of the Avater by this means. course, in accordance with the rain supply, the feeders of the reservoir, its capacity, and the size of the outlet. Tavo hundred thousand gallons are no unusual quantity of water to be poured from a spring, and in Central France, 231 springs have been gauged, and yield 2,628,000 gallons every tAventy-four hours, while 180,000 gallons are poured daily from the Bath spring, though this supply has been yielded Avithout any diminution for a time as far back as history extends. The Avarm springs of Georgia discharge 1,400 gallons per minute, and those of Bath County, in Virginia, yield not less than 6,000 in the same space of time;* Avhile the upper springs at Banff, in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, have been calcu lated to discharge fully half a million gallons per minute. It is thus clear that the endless gey7sers and other hot springs must deprive the earth of an immense amount of warmth, and that when, as happens Avith many both cold and thermal springs, they are laden with silica and carbonate of lime, their agency in dissolving out and depositing elseAvhere the materials of the earth's crust must be consider able. Added to this fact, many springs \u2014 \"mineral waters\" \u2014 are charged with iron and other materials Avhich they have taken up in their course to the surface, and which ex traneous materials constitute their value for medicinal purposes. Indeed, it is scarcely necessary to add that the varying composition of all springs and wells is due to the matters Avhich they dissolve out of the earth or out of the rocks, for rain-water is perfectly pure. Various Forms. \u2014 Again, it often happens \u2014 as, for instance, with most of the springs in the chalk region of the Eastern Alps \u2014 that the rain(Fig 132,B)sinks doAvn through the porous chalk until it reaches an impervious clay,-f when it accumulates and rises up until it saturates the chalk to the line u Q., when the overplus of water is discharged in springs at both sides of the valley. This, indeed, will sometimes happen even when the impervious water-stopping bed slopes, but in that case the spring at the upper end of the line of satura tion Avill run dry more quickly than the one at the loAver end of it, and the upper surface of the saturated bed will be in a curve. If there is a break in the spongy overlying stratum, then the springs will (Fig. 132, c) burst out whenever the line of saturation reaches this crack. Surface wells vary Avith the varying supply of moisture to the surface, and the streams fed by them are equally subject to the influ ence of the passing shoAvers. They are too shalloAv to store any great reserve of water; their, chief value is simply in gathering the drip into hollows and keeping it of a more uniform temperature than the rivulets exposed to the sky. Wells at a greater depth are less capricious, both as to supply and to tempera ture. But it is only those Avhich derive their supply from the reservoirs accumulated in Springs sometimes rise on the surface in a place where they could scarcely have been looked for. In these cases Ave may shreAvdly infer that the Avater in Avorking doAvn through gravity has met with a fault or some other dislocation or irregularity of the beds not suspected, Avhich has turned it out of its course. In other cases, we knoAv that water in t The adjective impervious, the reader will understand, is employed in a comparative sense only. No rock is really impervious to water, though many clays are so practi cally impenetrable by liquid, that they are used for pud dling purposes, i.e., to make basins, etc., \" water-tight. * Walton : \" The Mineral Springs of the United States and Canada \" (1873)."], [283, "VARIOUS FORMS OF SPRINGS. 271 sinking doAvn through a crack will in time be prevented by the gradually narroAving diameter of the fissure from proceeding farther in that direction. But it may happen that almost continuous Avith the original crack another will be found into which the Avater will run, and thus, finding no passage downward, it will rise to the surface by the hydrostatic pressure of the Avater above and behind it, even though the course described is in the form of an irregular curve, or, it may be, of a siphon. If the crack through Avhich the Avater descends intervals of inaction \u2014 are due to various causes. The most common cause of a spring ceasing for a time to discharge, and then, after an interval, going on as before, is that its source is some holloAv in the rock Avhich only discharges Avhen it overflows in the shape of Avaste water. The moisture, Avorking its Avay sloAvly through the soil, is often longer in reaching this reservoir than at other times. Hence the irregularity of its overflow.* No doubt, also, some springs Avhich owe to gas** the motive-poAver by which their water Fig. 132. \u2014 DIAGRAMS ILLUSTRATING THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH SPRINGS ISSUE FROM THE SOIL.

In this case, the water would most likely be warm when it issued through the other leg of the siphon \u2014 or, rather, through the second leg of the V \u2014 in a copious peren nial spring, the Avarmth being due to the heat of the deep-seated rocks, and the copiousness and continuity of the Aoav to the great reservoir which so extensive a fissure must form. To this class belong many of the best knoAvn thermal springs, which are not due to the presence of volcanoes, such as that of Bath (117\u00b0 to 120\u00b0). To this category also belong those of Baden (84-20\u00b0), and Voslau (66-20\u00b0), as well as many of the still warmer \" baths,\" such as Carlsbad (165-2\u00b0), Ofen (111\u00b0 to 147\u00b0), Mehadia (104\u00b0 to 147\u00b0), Wiesbaden (158\u00b0), Baden-Baden (111-20\u00b0 to 154-4\u00b0), etc., from the temperature of which might, according to the rule usually adopted (p. 83), be approximately calculated the depth to which they extend. Intermittent Springs. \u2014 Intermittent springs \u2014 that is, springs Avhich alternately flow and get dry, or flow with more or less regular sent out from the reservoirs in which it ac cumulates will be intermittent. The water will, in such cases, only Aoav after a supply of gas has accumulated, folloAved by an interval proportioned to the time it takes for the motive-poAver to re-gather its force. Such springs are thus, in some respects, like geysers. It is more than likely that the \"English Well\" in the Canton of Berne, Avhich flows for a feAV hours in the morning and a feAV hours in the evening, is of this character. The \" May springs,\" Avhich begin to Aoav in that month and continue until August, are due to the infiltration of Avater from the melting of the snoAV and ice in the comparatively low levels. In the same way, as I have shown elsewhere,? there are intermittent brooks in Eastern Ore- gon, due to the melting of the snoAvs on the Cascade Mountains during the heat of the * The \" nailbournes \" and \" winterbournes\" of the South of England are springs which flow from the satu rated chalk after periods of heavy rainfall (p. 270).

Some times, when travelling in the arid region at the eastern foot of the range mentioned, we would encamp in the forenoon by the side of a stream Avith barely sufficient water for camp purposes, but, on returning in the evening, would find it roaring and crashing along, so full of water as to render the fording of it a matter of difficulty, and again in the morning it Avould be almost dry, with the marks of last night's flood visible on the wet sand. The same phenomenon is to be seen in other parts of America,* as Avell as in various other regions of the Avorld. I have seen muleteers near the basin of Mount Shasta (14,400 feet), in Northern California, waiting for the \" rising of the creek \" like the children of Israel for the smiting of the rock, and it Avas sometimes long after dark before the stream Avould be beard rushing doAvn its former dry bed. So familiar Avas this phenomenon, that sufficient water for breakfast would be saved over night, knowing that the \"creek\" would be almost dry before morning. It is extremely probable that springs Avhich look for their supply to similar sources will share in this intermittent floAV. At Fontestorbe, in the Pyrenees, there is a spring which, during the summer months, alternately flows for 36 minutes 35 seconds, and then ceases for 32i minutes. In Avet Aveather, however, it ceases to be irregular or even intermittent. Near Brest is a Avell Avhich sinks with the Aoav and rises Avith the ebbing of the sea. But now and then intermittent springs are perfectly regular, but change Avith the Aveather ; and some have in course of time entirely or partially lost their peculiarities, flowing with little or no intermission, evidently OAving to the wearing of the passages by the flow ing water, or to some other alteration of the beds, to which they OAve their special features.t ground supplies of water must be of enormous extent. This applies in an especial degree to those from which artesian wells (p. 273) derive their supply. London stands over one vast lake in the chalk, and in an artesian Avell sunk at Tours, leaves, stems of plants, and ears of grain tolerably fresh, came up Avith the Avater, Avhich terrestrial relics Avere traced to the de partment of Ardeche, about 255 miles distant. It must also follow that springs will occa sionally discharge under the sea. This occurs in the Persian Gulf, off the arid coast, near Bahrein. The boatmen take advantage of the fresh Avater bubbling up under the sea to dive doAvn, and then speedily filling their goat-skin sacks, rise Avith the ascending current. These springs are probably from the same source as those Avhich rise a little way inland, namely, the green hills of Oman, 500 miles distant. Both are tepid, and from their temperature are believed to rise from a depth of 800 feet. The Arabs imagine that this fresh water at the bottom of the sea is the material out of which the oysters make their pearls, and, Mr. Grattan Geary tells us, it is an ascertained fact that the best pearls are found after a season of heavy rains. Similar springs exist in the Gulf of Spezia and various points off the shores of Greece, though in the latter case they are cold, and, therefore, of shalloAver origin than those of the Persian Gulf. Though the sea can never be considered as the source of springs, there are circumstances which may cause them to rise and fall Avith the tide. For example, the tide may check the Aoav of a spring Avith an outlet near the sea-shore by ascending for a long distance up its channel. Thus, according to Mr. Cooley, in the military hospital at Lille, about 35 miles from the sea shore, there is a copious Avell Avhich has a daily and also a monthly variation. Its maximum discharge during the day, Avhich is nearly double its minimum, occurs always about eight hours after high tide on the coast be tAveen Calais and Dunkirk. Finally, Ave may add, that springs in granitic regions \u2014 being, as a rule, derived from isolated reservoirs \u2014 are numerous, but not very copious, while those Avhich permeate more porous rocks \u2014 being Submarine Springs. \u2014 Some of the under- * General Marcy narrates a similar observation when exploring the Red River of the South, but fails to account for the phenomenon. t Cooley : \"Physical Geography,\" pp. 250, 251, 253."], [285, "ARTESIAN WELLS. 273 frequently in more or less continuous commu nication \u2014 are more abundant inches, and when the depth of 181 feet had been reached in boring, a volume of water rose, and rushed up Avith such impetus that it formed a jet d'eau several hundred feet high.

They are usually found in plains or basin-shaped valleys, tOAvards Avhich the strata dip on one or more sides, and get their name from having been long in use in the province of Artois (the ancient Artesium), in France, where one is known to have been in existence as early as the year a.d. 1126.

The dotted line shows the level, of the sea. The principle on Avhich they act is that the water, percolating through the upturned edges of the strata, finds its Avay down, AA-hen it ac cumulates in greater or less quantity, accord ing to the greater or less permeability of the beds. But when a shaft or Avell is bored per pendicularly through the beds, the subter ranean Avaters Avill immediately7 force themselves up through the opening, until, according to a Avell-knoAvn hydrostatic law \u2014 that water rises always to its own level \u2014 it attains the highest point of the water-containing strata. It also follows that the loAver the surface of the were instantly7 bloAvn out and forced high in the air.

For several day7s the flow continued unabated, and then gradually subsided to the more moderate discharge now characteristic of the Avell* There is, of course, only a limited amount of water in any water holding bed, and though artesian Avells Aoav seemingly without any abatement, then dis charge is entirely regulated by7 the supply7 which floAvs in from the surface.

The force with which the Avater ascends is often very great. For instance, during the autumn of 1886 an artesian Avell in Belleplaine, Iowa, by the violence and copiousness with AA-hich it spouted, threatened, for a time, to do serious damage to the toAvn. Its diameter was four * St. James's Gazette (London). September 13th, 1886. There is a useful summary of all the essential facts re garding artesian wells, especially those of the London basin, in a paper by Mr. Hayward in The Journal qr Microscopy and Xatural Science, July, 1887, pp. 117 \u2014 162. 18"], [286, "274 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. has so far sunk below it, that the water re quires to be pumped up. One great well will even exhaust several smaller ones at a less depth in its vicinity. For example, when an artesian well was sunk in the London Clay at Streatham (in 1885), the pumps at Tooting, two miles distant, ceased to draAv, the shallower beds from which they obtained their supplies having been tapped. Water, however, percolates so slowly through some rocks, that cases are known of rivers fed almost entirely by springs floAving with undiminished volume after eighteen months of drought, the supply being derived from the intensely saturated beds of Chalk. 2,900 feet. As for wells of 500 feet and 600 feet, they are numerous all over the Paris Basin. The Tertiary strata upon Avhich London and its suburbs are built is riddled with ar- tesian wells. Here it often happens that a porous bed \u2014 sand, sandstone, or generally chalk \u2014 is included betAveen two impenetrable layers of clay so as to form \"a flat, porous U-tube, continuous from side to side of the valley, the outcrop on the surrounding hills forming the mouths of the tube.\" The water which has oozed in through the porous layer accumulates at the bottom in the shape of a subterranean pool, while \" the bquid or semi- liquid column, pressing upon it, constitutes a sort of natural hydrostatic bellows,\" which causes so severe a strain on the superincum- bent strata, that the upheaval or disturb- ance of the valley occasionally caused is so sensible, that some earthquake tremors may be due to this source. Naturally when this accumulation is tapped by the artesian borer, a rush of water to the surface is the result. Hence the ease with which ex cellent water is obtained out of the Chalk which lies beneath the London Clay. The source of the NeAv River is a chalk spring near Ware, which yields 4\u00a3 million gallons a day ; and many of the breweries, prisons, and public fountains (like those in Trafalgar Square) are supplied by these \" blow- wells,\" as they are known to the people in the dis- trict between the Chalk wolds near Louth and the Wash. Two artesian wells at Croydon, in Surrey, yield a million gallons a day ; and at Bourn, in Lincolnshire, the water rises to the tops of the highest houses. In China there are some which reach to a depth of over 2,800 feet, and of late years whole dis- tricts in the deserts of Tunis and Algeria have become green fruitful oases by the sinking of artesian wells for the purpose of supplying irrigation during the most parched season of the year and during exceptionally dry seasons. Some artesian wells are of great depth. That sunk in the Grenelle Basin, near the Hotel des Invalides, Paris (Fig. 133), is about 1,800 feet deep ; its bore is 10 inches, its dis charge at the rate of 517 gallons per minute, and its temperature 82\u00b0. At St. Louis, in Missouri, there is one 3,843| feet deep ; but, owing to its having tapped salt-bearing strata, the water is saline. At Kissingen, in Bavaria, the salt spring throAvs up a column of water to the height of 58 feet from a depth of over 1,878 feet ; but this is not properly an artesian well, for the projecting force is not hydrostatic pressure, but carbonic acid gene rated at the junction of the gypsum with the magnesian limestone at a depth of about 1,680 feet. But the deepest Avell in the Avorld is that of Sperenberg (p. 84), near Berlin, (4,194 feet), which, sinking through immense beds of rock-salt, produces nothing but brine. An artesian well may be sunk whenever the conditions described are present. However, as these are chiefly in the Secondary and Ter tiary formations, the London and Paris Basins, Avhich are of these geological ages, are more penetrated with them than any other sections of the world. The Grenelle well we have already noticed. That of Passy, 1,700 feet deep, throws up 5,582,000 gallons per day to the height of 54 feet above the surface of the ground ; and at La Chapelle there is one to be sunk to the depth of 2,950 feet ; while another at Butte aux Cailles is intended to be bored to the depth of from 2,600 feet to It does not, of course, follow that if two impermeable strata with a porous one between them crop out around a basin, all the essen tials for an artesian well are present. On"], [287, "CHEMICAL ACTION OF RAIN. 275 the contrary, if the permeable bed is either broken or interrupted, the water will not accumulate ; and if the confining strata are in any way dislocated, they Avill not keep the Avater imprisoned. In boring, the lower con fining layer must not be pierced, otherwise the Avater will escape and the Avell be de stroyed, unless, of course, the conditions be repeated lower doAvn, Avhich they frequently are. Hence the necessity of a thorough sur vey of the geological conditions of the locality before a bore is attempted. already have seen for himself, if springs are derived from rain, or from the infiltration of rivers and lakes (Avhich, in some cases, they may be, Fig. 131), they must in every instance have obtained their extraneous materials, their various salts, arid other active substances, after they descended into the soil. In other words, they dissolved them out of the earth or the rocks through Avhich they passed. All water, when it comes down from the sky \u25a0 \u2014 unless, indeed, it gets impure through the smoke of large cities \u2014 is absolutely tasteless. The colour of water, hoAvever, varies, though these tints are due either to the play of light or to foreign substances. When Padre de Acosta tells us that in Mexico he had seen \" a spring as it Avere ink, someAvhat bleAv ; in Peru another of colour red like blood, Avhere upon they called it the Red River,\" the hue must have been owing either to the colour of the bottom or to various impurities, unless, indeed, the \" bleAv \" was due to reflection from the blue sky, and the red to trans mission of light. Blue may be produced in Avater by exceedingly minute particles of any kind of matter. The blue colour of the Lake of Geneva has been proved to be due to sus pended solid particles, so that, in all likeli hood, pure water has no colour by diffusive refraction* It folloAvs from what has already been said regarding the gradual increase of temperature as Ave descend into the earth's crust, that the deeper the well the hotter the Avater. This, accordingly7, is what we find. The tempera ture of some of these artesian bores has already been noticed (pp. 83, 84, 274). That of Kissingen is 66\u00b0, that of St. Louis 73-4\u00b0, that of Louisville 76|\u00b0, and one at Charleston rises to the temperature of 87\u00b0. Accordingly, the Avater from these wells has been utilised for the purpose of keeping up a uniform Avarmth in fish-ponds and cress-plots, and in heating hospitals and conservatories, Avhile that derived from the one at Wiirtemberg is employed in maintaining a constant temperature of 47\u00b0 in manufactories, even when the air out side is beloAv the freezing-point. But, natur ally, the principal purpose to which the water is applied is drinking, irrigation, driving machinery, or generating steam. But rain-water, in circulating through the soil to form springs or wells, and springs, again, in circulating through the earth in order to reach the surface, exercise an im portant action on the materials of the crust with which they come into contact. Rain and Springs: Erosion. Rain, in falling on the surface or in sinking into it to form springs, or springs in travers ing the under world in order to find an outlet, act in two ways. Firstly, they have a chemical action ; and secondly, they act mechanically, simply by the friction Avhich they cause, though it is not ahvays easy to exactly define the limits of these tAvo provinces. In reality, they generally act more or less in conjunc tion. HoAvever, for convenience' sake, let us examine the two separately. The action of the rain which sinks into the soil is, in the first place, chemical. In itself it would not dissolve much except rock-salt and other salts (Figs. 134-136). But carbonic acid gas being freely absorbed by the Avater, in its course through the air or through the soil, it exerts a poAverfully disintegrating action on the rocks, by rendering many substances soluble in it which would othenvise only be * Tyndall : \" Fragments of Science,\" p. 258 ; \" Hours of Exercise in the Alps,\" pp. 463-470.

Then, if the rock is on a slope, \" spates,\" or the mechanical action of the rainfall, SAveep away the loosened materials, depositing the silicate of alumina river, the Avindings of Avhich have never been fully traced. In like manner the River Poik runs through the famous Adelsberg Grotto (Figs. 28, 29). Sometimes part of the roof falls in, disclosing the stream braAvling under ground, and by-and-by, when the roof is not very thick and tbe rainfall has slowly disin tegrated what the solvent poAver of the stream has left behind, it entirely falls in, leaving a valley or basin; and, in not a few instances, many of the curious \" punch - boAvl \" like hollows one meets among limestone hills may be due to this cause. The amount of material dissolved out by some of the hot springs Ave have already referred to (p. 220). But many of the cold ones are not much behind them in this form of eroding activity. Volger, fcr example, has reckoned that the Lorenzquelle of the Leuk Baths (93\u00b0\u2014 123\u00b0), in Switzerland, washes out of the mountain enough gypsum in 600 years to make a cavern one foot deep over one square mile ; but this is nothing to the hot springs of Warasdin-Teplitz, in Croatia, Avhich discharge 462,000 gallons of Avater daily \u2014 at a temperature of 132\u00b0 Fahr. \u2014 containing various soluble substances ; or the Carlsbad springs, Avhich, as Ave have seen, are even more poAverful geological agents. It is therefore not astonishing to find ex tensive caverns formed in this manner, or that many os' them \u2014 those of Carniola, for example \u2014 have extensive ramifications over a large extent of country. What are called \" Pipes \" and \" SAvalloAV Holes \" are other instances of the chemical action of rain on limestone rock. If the rain collects in any little holloAv it will gradually deepen it, or if it works in through the joints or through a crack the same re sult Avill folloAv. A funnel-shaped cavity, or \" swalloAv hole,\" will be formed, to get tilled up in time Avith the roots of plants, which Avill end in disrupting and widening the gap, or with earth and gravel from the surface. Good examples of these pipes are seen in the chalk quarries by the side of the Great Northern Railway at Hitchin* If, on the other hand, there is no soil on the surface, these SAvallets, or pot holes \u2014 as they are called in Yorkshire \u2014 Fig. 136. \u2014 CAVERN IN THE SALT MINES OF AVIELICZKA. {Kaolin or China Clay) here, the quartz in the shape of sand there, and so forth. Caverns, Pipe Holes, etc. \u2014 But when the rain Aoavs under ground in the form of a running spring, its effect on the soil is even more marked from a chemical point of vieAV. It dissolves out the limestone until it forms great channels and caverns like those already described (p. 66), and uniting into consider able streams \u2014 like those which traverse the Peak Caverns in Derbyshire \u2014 flows in the shape of a river underground. Sometimes these caverns, holloAved out by springs, engulf livers, like the Manifold in Staffordshire, Avhich floAvs for nearly three miles under the \u25a0earth, or the Aire in Yorkshire, Avhich, in a portion of its course, runs through the under ground cavity Avhich ends at the foot of Malham Cove. In the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky there is an extensive underground * Jukes-Browne : \" Physical Geology,\" pp. 86\u201492,"], [290, "278 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. way, though, of course, on a larger scale (Fig. 137). remain open, and not infrequently afford an opening through Avhich the surface streams find their AA'ay7 into the ground. Many caverns begin with SAvallo w holes ; the Avater entering them, charged Avith carbonic acid derived from the air and the decay of vegetation, gradu ally works doAvnAvards, and excavates as it goes. Mechanical Action. \u2014 The mechanical action of rain is easily observed in the crumbling of the stones of Avhich buildings are composed, and in the constant \" Aveathering \" which the sharpest mountain peaks undergo. The in fluence of this weathering in the formation of desert sands has already been noticed (p. 8). When a heavy shoAver falls we see Iioav soon it sAveeps the surface of any loose matter, the roadAvays being, after a sharp thunder \"plump \" Avashed almost clean. If this pour falls on a slope the result is still more marked, for the soil is Avorn into deep channels by the temporary streamlets, and, where it is not protected by dense vegetation, is often so completely sAvept into the valley beloAv \u2014 Avhere the stream carries it aAvay and deposits it in another form elseAvhere \u2014 that in tropical and semi tropical countries it is by no means uncommon to see a hillside bare doAvn to the \" bed rocks,\" and what was not long before a fertile dale covered with a mass of debris. But the mechanical action of the rainfall is more marked in the sIoav Avearing away Avhich it causes, than in any such sudden violent action as that described. \" Gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed s\u00e6pe cadendo\" Avas a Avise maxim of Ovid. \" The rain-drop erodes the stone not by force, but by often dropping.\" In the Karst (Carniola) these pipe holes (which give a markedly honeycombed charac- Fig. 137. \u2014 PERPENDICULAR SECTION SHOWING \"KARREN\" EROSION IN THE LIMESTONE PLATEAUX (KARREN- FELDER) OF THE ALPS. ter to this plain) are knoAvn as \" dolinien \" or \" dolinas.\" They vary in size from some so small that they can scarcely be noticed to others as large as that of St. Kanzian, near Divazza, AA'hich is 525 feet deep. At the bottom of most of them is found a red earth \u2014 the terra rossa of that region \u2014 Avhich seems to be the ferruginous residue of the limestone undissolved AA7hen the soluble portions of the rock Avere carried aAvay by the rain and other eroding materials. In Northern Bohemia and Saxonj7 another interesting example of rain corrosion is exhibited by what is locally known as \" Karren,\" or \" Schratten,\" in the limestone plateaux of the Alps, and in the \" quader sandstone \" (Cretaceous) of Northern Bohemia and Saxony7, both mechanical and chemical action having been long at Avork in forming them, the material which causes the erosion being, for the most part, the melting snoAV. Sometimes in this \" Schrattenkalk \" we find hollows which bear tbe appearance of having been caA7ems the roofs of Avhich have fallen in. The \" Karren \" are often from 3 to 7 feet in depth, and occasionally they reach a depth varying from 13 feet to as many as 30, sometimes rounded, sometimes irresru lar, sometimes surrounded by rills, so that they form a glacier-like labyrinth. In all likelihood the Silbernalp and the Karrenalp of Switzerland have been formed in this Earth Pillars. \u2014 This is seen in the curious earth pillars of Tyrol (Fig. 138), where all that is left of a valley once composed of hard clay and earth is a number of columns from 26 to 100 feet in height, each usually capped by a stone. The rain, Avorking into the cracks in the indurated clay, gradually eroded the mass into the shapes it noAv possesses. The Avhole Avould long ago have crumbled into the mountain torrent that runs through the valley, had not the stones, which are thickly scattered through the clay7, protected the places in which they lie, until the rivulets trickling round them have left these stones capping the pyramids which in this way they have helped to form.

The \"Eppelings\" of Guiana (p. 43) are even more to the point, and Sir A. Geikie has figured pillars in the old Red Con glomerate of Fochabers in Scot- \\a like blocks of every fantastic shape, sometimes 60 feet in height, by the action of the rain and by the streamlets due to the rain, the shoAvers often finishing off the outline of the rough forms thus blocked out.

Landslips. \u2014 Rain, however, acts mechanic ally in another Avay. By oozing in between two strata lying in a slope, it Avashes out the material which holds them together; or by working in, let us say, between a mass of sandstone lying on calcareous clay, it will speedily so loosen the beds, that on the first impetus being given to them, the Avhole will lose cohesion and tumble into the valley beloAv. This is called a landslip, and is well knoAvn in the Alps and other lofty regions, especially in the spring or after long rains and the thawing of the winter's snoAV. After a long spell of dry weather, followed by con tinuous rains, a landslip is particularly apt to occur. For the rain pours into the cracks in the soil, and thus more readily than other- Avise separates the beds. But the ordinary cause is that Avhich we have briefly indicated. It is daily at Avork on all the Swiss mountain slopes, and the history of the Alpine Republic is studded Avith tales of such catastrophes. As early as 563, Taurentum, a flourishing Roman town on the southern bank of the Lake of Geneva, was overwhelmed by a landslip from the moun tain in the shadow of Avhich it is built ; and near Flims there is a confused mass of stone and earth 2,000 feet high, Avhich seems to be the remains of a landslip before the Glacial period. Many of the Swiss villages exist al-' most on sufferance. The avalanche of siioav or the avalanche of earth may at any moment SAveep them away, or, what is equally7 ruin ous, overwhelm them Avith the debris of the mountain at the foot of or on Avhich they are built. In not a feAV instances the land slip is so sIoav in its progress that it is only a question of time Avhen the final catastrophe Avill be precipitated. At Bee Rouge in the Tarantaise, for example, tbe side of the moun tain is gradually .overwhelming the village of Mirior. In most cases, hoAvever, the calamity is sudden and unexpected. Such an instance is supplied by the fall of the Rufi or Ross berg, a well-known mountain, 5,141 feet high, situated just behind the better-known and loftier Rigi. In September, 1806, after a very rainy season, a large portion of the moun tain, consisting of beds of hard sandstone and pudding-stone resting on soft sandy layers, suddenly swept across the valley of Goldau, burying four villages, comprising over 300 houses, nearly 500 inhabitants, and more A landslip is thus in many respects like an avalanche. In its simplest form, it consists in the superincumbent layers of earth and rock sliding over those beneath them, Avhen, by the percolation of water, the junction betAveen the different beds has been loosened. After the long Alpine winter the melting snow oozes into the beds, washing out the loose sand or ill-compacted limestone, and then the strata, nothing holding them to gether, slide doAvn by mere force of gravity, -arrying Avith them vast quantities of ma terial resting on their upper ends, and bearing before them trees, rocks, and houses, which stand in their course. In August, 1826, after two dry seasons, there Avas such a landslip on the banks of the River Saco, in New Hamp shire. Immense masses of rocks were de tached, which swept doAvn the steep slopes"], [293, "MECHANICAL ACTION OF RAIN. 281 than 85 square miles of fertile land. It filled up about one-fourth of the Lake of LoAverz, the sudden rise of Avhich occasioned disasters in parts of the valley which had escaped with comparatively little injury from the landslip itself. In September, 1880, by a landslip at Naini Tal in the Himalayas, a large portion of the station was carried away, and thirty-eight Europeans were buried beneath the rubbish. In 1248 part of Mont Grenier, south of Cham bery, in Savoy, fell and buried five parishes ; Avhile in 1772 a portion of the mountain of Piz, in the then State of Venice, slid doAvn into the valley beloAv and overwhelmed three villages Avith their entire population. The Lakes of Derborence were formed by the barrier throAvn across the River Liserne by falls from the Diablerets, three of the five rocky peaks of Avhich have given way. But though an attempt has been made to regard rock avalanches of this kind as different from those due to landslips,* this is impossible, for in both the loosening power of water is the chief cause Avhich leads to the debacle. It may, however, happen that when the thick debris on a mountain side gets saturated Avith water, after heavy rains, it will slide doAvn a slope, OAving to the increased weight of the mass overcoming the friction Avhich has hitherto kept it in position. But, even then, the infiltrating rain has helped to weaken the retaining poAver of the beds. A case of this character may be cited from the village of Fetan, in the LoAver Engadine. According to Heim, houses are tilted, or split asunder, and the detached granite rock on which the church stands is said to be sloAvly sliding doAvmvards Avith the loAver material in which it is em bedded. The \" Muren,\" \" Murbriiche,\" or \" Schlamstrome,\" of the Tyrolese, are land slips of another, though an exceedingly in teresting character. They are caused by In 1855 a mass of rock and earth slid into the valley of the Tiber, Avhich, dammed back by the obstruction, overfloAved the village of San Stefano to the depth of 50 feet, until the droAvned village was relieved by means of a hastily-constructed canal. Another example of a disastrous landslip is that in Avhich, by the sliding of a portion of Monte Conto, the entire village of Plurs, with 2,430 inhabitants, Avas in 1618 OA7erwhelmed. For several days before the catastrophe masses of rock had become detached from the mountain, and numerous fissures Avere observed to form or widen on its sides. But the villagers dis regarded the warnings, and Avere in a few minutes buried with all their possessions beneath 60 feet of rock and earth. All attempts to penetrate the mass proved fruit less, and no trace of the town has since been seen. The earth Avhich entombed it is now clothed Avith a luxuriant forest of chest nuts, but the original name still survives in the little village of Plurs or Piuro, which tourists know as the site of a manufactory of little articles in soapstone, which Pliny speaks of as the \" Lapis comensis.\" In 1512 a mass of rock fell from Monte Crenone, above Biasca, Avhich destroyed 4,000 houses and killed 600 people.

Altogether, though the Elm catas trophe was, in the loss to life and property, of less magnitude than those Avhich overtook Plurs and Goldau, it is doubtful Avhether it did not, in the amount of rubbish shot from the mountain side, surpass both of these gigantic landslides. Professor Heim, who visited the spot immediately after the disaster, calculated that at the loAvest estimate the contents of the slip measured ten million cubic metres.* What a vast amount of material this pile contains may be grasped by a simple illustration. Zurich is a city of 76,000 inhabitants. Yet in the debris shot from the side of the Tschingel Alp there Avas stone enough to build two Zurichs. Some of the blocks are heaped 300 or 400 feet higher than the village of Elm. One is estimated to weigh 3,000 tons, and as were buried in or about Spiringen. The dark ness caused by the black dust resembled that of a London fog, and a peculiar smell filled the air, the result evidently of the enormous fric tion of the falling mass of rock. An eyewitness, on Avhose account we have draAvn, describes the noise of the tumbling stones as, at times, deafening. The Avhole black slope seemed alive from top to bottom, Avith rocks flying about in all directions. Sometimes a number of large blocks Avould detach themselves from the top, shoot horizontally into the air, tumble against each other, and disappear again in the dark clouds of dust beloAv. During the day the noise never ceased, and frequently during the night the din began again. Next day the result Avas evident in the lake Avhich had formed from the temporary embankment of the River Schachen by the materials Avhich had tumbled athwart it, and in the ruggedness of the landscape in the immediate vicinity. The rocky masses fell from such a height that it was found they had acquired so great a * A cubic metre is equal to about 35'28 cubic feet."], [295, "I MECHANICAL ACTION OF RAIN. 283 after a long spell of wet weather on the Dorset shire coast, a mass of limestone \u2014 1? mile long and 600 y7ards broad \u2014 slipped over a bed of clay into the sea, bearing Avith it houses, roads, and fields, though the mischief done was, in this instance, less than in any of the SAviss slides noticed.

Similar occurrences might be quoted from the records of many other parts of the coast, and here and there Ave come upon geological evidence Avhich entitles us to infer that long before History7 kept any7 chronicle of these disasters, they were going on in that steady7 systematically unsystematic Avay Avhich Nature loves. The saddest feature about these disasters is that there is no preventing them. A rebellious stream may be embanked, a treacherous sea may be dyked : but Avhat bulwark can an Alpine village erect Avhich could for a moment bear the brunt of such artillery as 360,000,000 cubic feet of stone and earth, Avith bolts weighing 3,000 tons, shot from a height of 2,000 feet ?

The villagers \u2014 as Ave have seen \u2014 sometimes get an inkling of Avhat is coming, though, as a rule, the slide is so sudden that until the roar of the fatal crash sounds in the ears of the doomed people they are scarcely conscious of the fate which awaits them. But even when they are foreAvarned, they generally hesitate to leave their homes, their farms, and their little all, on the mere chance of a calamity which, perhaps, may never arrive. In England there are plenty of landslips, but they rarely do more damage than destroy ing a railway embankment or tumbling doAvn a sea cliff.

HoAvever, it is unnecessary to define running, as distinguished from standing, water. Every one has an idea sufficiently correct for common purposes as to what is meant by a spring, a brook \u2014 the Scotch \"burn\" \u2014 the Avestern American\" creek \" \u2014 a name applied by nautical surveyors to an, inlet of the sea, \u2014 a river, and a lake. height which determines the direction Avhich any particular set of rivers will take. Hence it is ahvays over relatively, though not neces sarily absolutely, high ground. The \"Great Divide\" in Central North America is, for example, the saddle, on one side of Avhich the rivers ending in the Pacific begin \u2022their course, and on the other those Avhich terminate in the Atlantic. This water shed is, hoAvever, often not the highest point in any particular region. Rivers usually have their principal source in lofty mountains. But such mountains rarely form the Avater shed, for the simple reason that in chains of mountains, as Mr. Cooley aptly points out, the loftiest peaks are frequently in ad vance of the general range, and rivers which flow off in front rise in the rear. Theh sources are among mountains from which they escape by winding round the greatest elevations. Thus, the Brahmapootra and the Indus rise in the lofty plateaux north of the Himalayas, and break through the mountains to reach the plain. Again, in the Carpa thians, the source of the Vistula \u2014 which flows nortliAvard \u2014 is on the south, and that of the Theiss \u2014 Avhich takes an opposite course \u2014 is on the northern side of the Tatra, the central granite range Avhich rises from the tablelands of Liptau and Zips, which in their turn form the valleys of the Waag and Popper* Source. \u2014 It is always difficult to define the exact source of a, river (Fig. 146). Water invariably running down hill, it folloAvs that a river must rise in comparatively high ground. But a stream rarely owes its origin to a single spring, or rivulet from that spring, or other individual source. Its volume is contributed to by a great number of feeders, Avhich are SAvollen by the rain falling Avithin a particular \" catchment basin.\" Into this catchment basin, or area, runs the drainage of a par ticular section of country, this drainage as a rule ending by many tributaries in one great river, Avhich flows along the lowest level of the region which it drains. This basin is determined by a line drawn so as to take in all the sources of the tributaries, the waters of which end eventually in this main river, while the Avatershed, or divide of land, is the * The Carpathians divide the vast steppes of Eussia and the broad Hungarian plains.

Tributaries. \u2014 It is still more difficult to define Avhich particular stream is the main and Avhich the tributary river. The broadest is usually taken as the head stream, though sometimes it is more convenient to accept the longest one for this distinction. This decision is, hoAvever, frequently very arbitrary. For instance, the Missouri is really a more im- 19"], [302, "290 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. the united stream takes the name of the latter. In like manner, the Moldau, though really a greater river than the Elbe, has been robbed of the glory of being regarded as such.

Lake Sources. \u2014 It may even happen that a head stream originates in marshy ground soaked by oozing springs either from the bottom or from the higher ground, and that therefore it becomes difficult to fix upon any one as the source of the rivulet. Again, a river is erroneously said to originate in a lake when, in reality7, the river merely Aoavs through it \u2014 in at one end and out at the other \u2014 without its volume being much in creased, except Avhen the lake is surrounded by high banks, from which the melting snoAV in early summer contributes to the contents, or Avhen other tributaries fall in. In such a case the lake basin is deep, and the outfioAv ing river is merely the overpouring of the vessel. But Avhen several streams of about equal volume feed a lake, the most considerable one by Avhiah the surplus is discharged may be said to originate in the lake, as not one of the tributary streams has a right to be recognised as the upper waters of the river. The lake in Avhich the Scottish Spey arises is one of this description. So are Loch Maree the source of the EAve, the little lake (Itasca)f in Avhich the Upper Mississippi arises, and possibly Lake Lauricocha, the conventional source of the Amazon. Spring Sources. \u2014 These riverine tributaries originate in springs, in streams which Aoav from under glaciers (the Rhone, for example), or in lakes. But a lake is, generally speak ing, merely a reservoir formed by a temporary accumulation of the Avaters of springs and rivulets, or a simple enlargement in a IioIIoav in the course of a river. A stream may also originate in the melting of snoAVS. But such a source cannot Avell be permanent, though, as Ave shall presently see, streams fed by melt ing suoavs are subject to periodical SAvellings and overfloAvs Avhen the banks are Ioav. One of the most copious spring sources in Britain Avas St. Winifred's Well, in Flint shire, Avhich at one time* discharged 21 tuns (5,292 gallons) of Avater per minute. Of late years, OAving to some of its sources of supply having been cut off, the discharge has declined to less than 12 tuns, so that steam-poAver is required for the Avork Avhich previously was perfoi-med by the Avater-poAver supplied by the Avell, and by a brooklet Avhich joins the Avell stream about fifty yards from the Avell itself.

On the Siberian rivers, most of which Aoav into the Arctic Ocean, the north Avind, as might be expected, often prevails. When this is the case, the boat men utilise the aid of the current by tying a large bundle of sticks loaded Avith stones in such a Avay that it is inclined to sink. This bundle, thrown into tbe water and carried doAvn by the current, is prevented from sinking to the bottom by the rope which connects it Avith the boat's head. But suspended in the strong current it overcomes the resistance of the wind, and permits the vessel to drift seaAvard Avith the stream.

This is, in the first instance, OAving to some important tribu tary being swollen by rains far east or Avest, north or south, of the main current ; and in the second, to tributaries SAvelling in consequence of the melting of the snoAvs in the uplands, or in the northern regions in which they rise. We see this in the case of the Nile, the Mississippi, and other rivers. The Nile, swollen by the spring rains of Abyssinia, inundates the plain of Egypt every summer at or about the same period. The height to Avhich it rises in Upper Egypt is from 30 to 40 feet ; at Cairo, loAver doAvn, the river is from seven to nine feet less, while in the Delta it is not more than four feet. In like manner, the Ganges, SAvollen by the melt ing snows of the Himalayas, begins to rise in April and continues to do sc until the over flow floods the plains to the depth of some 30 feet.

Then the Ioav country- on either side is entirely submerged, and the river itself is marked out only by the clear broad band of Avater in the midst of the inundated forests. it. Hence, a flood being too rare and of too brief duration, it cannot scour out a channel sufficiently broad and deep for its accom modation in the comparatively short period during which it lasts. There are, however, other causes of floods. For instance, as Mr. Vernon - Harcourt has pointed out, a river deposits in the channel, whenever the current is checked, a large amount of the solid matter which it either Avasbed from its banks, and Avhich has been ground from the mountain rocks by glaciers, and SAvept into the river by the sub-glacial stream, or which its tributaries have eroded before they AA-ere lost in the main current they contribute to. This material conse quently raises the river-bed and impedes the floAv of the stream. Moreover, a river flowing Freshets or \" spates \" also produce tem porary overfloAvs of much shorter duration, but, OAving to their suddenness, of greater destructiveness. In Western Europe, for ex ample, the Rhone sometimes rises 23 feet at Avignon, the Saone 24 h feet, and at Paris the Seine has been known to rise 20 feet above its average level, while during the inunda tions of 1827 the Ardeche at Gournier rose more than 69 feet. Floods are more frequent during the Avinter than the summer months, since, OAving to the absence of eA-aporation, a greater amount of the rainfall finds its way into the river at that period than during the summer, when the thirsty soil and the abun dant vegetation retain a large portion. All floods are, physically7, due to the inadequacy of the riArer channel to carry off the unwonted supply of Avater within a given period. A river bed is formed and maintained by its stream, and is therefore only equal to dis charging the ordinary amount Avhich reaches Fig. 149. \u2014 DIAGRAMS SHOWING HOW THE C 1URSE OF A BROOK GRADUALLY BECOMES ALTERED. through a plain has a tendency to increase its serpentine cours 3 by excaA7ating concavities on one bank and depositing part of the ma terial thus eaten out on the opposite shore, which, by diminishing its fall, reduces its velocity. These facts\u2014 which will be again referred to when the erosive power of rivers is under discussion (p. 298)\u2014 are well shoAvn in the diagram (Fig. 149) prepared to ex plain the gradual alteration in the course of a brook.

These deposits then encroach on the Avater, and the Avater encroaches on the opposite shore. The bend thus produced increases in magnitude, and becomes a cause of similar action in the opposite direction (Fig. 149 b, b, 149 c, b), so that it must inevitably follow that the meanderings of the brook will steadily increase in number and magnitude (Fig. 149 c, a, b, c), Avhilst an interrupted series of sand deposits (Fig. 149 c, a, d, e) Avould be found behind each of its tiny sheltering head lands* sarily make a country fruitful. On the con trary, by draining away the rainfall, it may increase its aridity7. In dry regions, like Northern Africa, the Cape Colon}7, and Southern Europe generally, the course of a river may be traced by the green vegetation Avhich groAvs on either side of it, though this ribbon extends no farther than where the soil is moistened by the water oozing out from the river by means of capillary attrac tion. All beyond this narrow boundary is arid, except where it is irrigated : then its native fertility is at once apparent. The Plain of Shinar Avas at one time a fruitful garden ; but, though the Euphrates and the Tigris floAv Avhere they aBvays did, the irri gating works no longer existing, the land has reverted into its original condition of desert. When the Mormons first came into Salt Lake Valley, they found a trapper, Avell known to the writer, encamped on the spot Avhere Salt Lake City is built. He laughed incredulously at the idea of the immigrants ever raising an ear of Avheat out of the parched soil of that forbidding-looking region. But, by irriga tion, it is iioav a fertile land ; though outside the limits refreshed by the streams of water, the sage-brush (Artemisia), an unfailing sign of a parched region in that part of North America, may be seen close to the fence of a peach orchard or a field of grain. Hence rivers, if left to themselves, tend to \" deteriorate,\" from the engineer's point of vieAv ; the discharging capacity of their chan nels becomes less. The gradual silting up of the River Theiss near Szegedin, in Hungary, produced a rise in its flood-level, Avhich led to the disastrous inundations of 1879 and 1SS7 ; and so extensively hav7e some of the rivers of Japan been silted up, and the embankments protecting the adjoining country propor tionately raised, that \" some of these em banked rivers have their beds as much as 40 feet above the level of the plains over which they7 Aoav.\" In like manner, the bed of the Po has become higher than the ad jacent land, so that, by simply opening sluices, the fat meadoAvs of Lombardy and the rice fields of Venetia and Emilia are inundated. At the same time, it is certain that the in crease of subsoil drainage, by SAveeping the rainfall more rapidly off the soil, not only precipitates these floods, but, by stopping the supply to springs, renders summer droughts more frequent than they were Avhen the country Avas left to the unaided efforts of Nature. When a river naturally overfloAvs \u2014 i.e., Avhen it is not contained within embankments \u2014 the heavier sediment being first deposited, and the lighter carried farther off' to be spread over a Avider area, the banks close to the river aro raised more rapidly than the country farther back, so that a sort of natural embankment is the result. The same laAV holds good regarding the silt deposited in its course. The finest materials are borne farthest; the coarsest are soon left behind ; though tho deposition does not usually begin until the speed of the river slackens, Avhich is always the case Avhen it arrives at the flattest country through Avhich it Aoavs before falling into the sea, this \" champaign \" being, in many in stances, the offspring of the silt brought down by the river in former ages. (Fig. 150). Periodical floods, however, as in the well knoAvn case of the Nile, to which the fertility of Egypt is due, may be regarded as a part of tbe plan of Creation for utilising the surplus rain of the Avorld.

This is OAving to the fact that soil sinking down, to be stored up for the supply of Avater in the shape of springs. The Nile (Fig. 151) is an example of a riA-er which diminishes tOAvards its mouth. Its last con siderable tributary- is the Atbara, Avhich joins it 1200 miles from the Mediterranean, and during the months from March to June is little more than a chain of pools, the Fig. 150. \u2014 THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA, FORMED BY THE MUD BROUGHT DOWN BT THE RIVER, only a certain amount of the rainfall is dis- charged in this manner. Much of it is evaporated, and this evaporation of course holds good as to streams, as Avell as to other water supplies. The Thames* at Staines discharges 3240 cubic inches per minute per square mile, or equal to less than a third of the rainfall, Avhich is also the case of the Seine at Paris. But in the Mississippi (Fig. 150) basin only one-fourth is thus dis- charged into the sea. The same ratio of drainage to rainfall holds true regarding the Till . Libe in Bohemia. Much, hoAvever, depends on the nature of the soil\u2014 the rain Avhich falls en hard impervious slate or clay running oft the surface, that Avhich drops on porous haunt of crocodiles, hippopotami, and turtles. Hence, OAving to this cause, as Avell as to the Avater withdrawn for irrigating purposes, the Nile diminishes beloAv this point. From the confluence of the Panjnad doA\\mAvard the Indus gets smaller. In the interior of Aus tralia and India some streams only Aoav after rains, or have \u2014 as in the former country7 \u2014 no regular channel, but in place of this there is a succession of flats liable to inundation. What are known in Western America as \"sinks,\" are exemplified by more than one of the streams which lose themselves in the interior of Australia, and on the Avestem slope of the Rocky Mountains are shoAvn in the \" sinks \" in the dry desert country- AA'here the Carson and the Humboldt disappear. * Beardniore : \" Hydrology,\" p. 201."], [308, "296 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. Alternating Flow. \u2014 A curious feature, Avhich Dr. Clyde has described as \" alternating Aoav,\" is exhibited by Lake Ngami, a shalloAV lake in the southern part of Central Africa. \" Its chief influents, Zouga from the south east, and Tonke from the north-AA-est, are in Aood at different seasons. Zouga in Aood avails to make the lake overAoAV into and up Tonke, Avhich is then very Ioav; Tonke in Aood aA'ails to make the lake overflow into and up Zouga, Avhich is low in its turn. When Lake Ngami contains more water than to 4 feet deep, but in the wet season it serves as a backwater to the Mekong, until it attains a depth of from 40 feet to 50 feet, and, stem ming the current of its OAvn feeders, overflows the entire country for miles in every7 direc tion, and even shalloAV valleys not belonging to its own drainage. The infloAv of the tide, as Ave knoAv from familiar observation, stems the doAA'n Aoav of most rivers. But the immense Aood of the Amazon seems an exception to this rule. Yet at Santarem, 500 miles from the mouth, the Fig. 151. \u2014 THE NILE DELTA, FORMED BT THE MUD BROUGHT DOWN RY THE RIVER. can be disposed of by the alternating Aoav, the excess escapes northwards by7 an offset from Zouga called Malabe, which branches out so as to meet the Chobe, a tributary to the Zambesi, at five points.

The belief, therefore, is, that Avhile the main current on the surface goes on uninter ruptedly to the Atlantic, the tide creeps up along the bottom. When the main river \u2014 far beyond the reach of the tide \u2014 rises OAving to a rainfall which has not reached the basins of its tributaries, there is a back Aoav of much the same kind as that described, though, of course, OAving to a different cause. The Tali-Sap Lake, on the confines of Cam bodia and Siam, is normally only- from 3 feet One of the most remarkable instances of these back Aoavs of rivers was afforded by the"], [309, "BACK FLOW AND MEANDERINGS OF A RIVER. 297 Indus in 1858. In that year, OAving to an obstruction similar to the one Avhich occurred in 1841 (p. 306), the river did not rise so fast as usual. But on the Sth of August the pent up Avaters burst their barriers and, and in the Alps there are many circumstances Avhich prove that torrents have existed in places Avhere their deposits are noAv the prin cipal evidence of their former ravages, t Finally, it may be added that there is every reason to believe that many rivers have, at some former period in their history7, been much fuller of Avater than they are at pre sent. Dana, indeed, in vieAv of the many terraces or benches Avhich exist on the banks of the American rivers \u2014 on a far grander scale than Ave knoAv them in Europe (on the Fraser in British Columbia,:]: on the Mac kenzie, and on the left bank of the YeUow stone in Montana, for example) \u2014 considers that they point to the gradual shoaling of the rivers during the elevation of the axis of that continent. In Morocco these benches \" Like as a wator-streanie whose swelling sourse Breaks forth, and makes his way more A'iolent,\" rushed doAvn Avith irresistible fury. At Attock the river rose to 80 feet above its low-Avater level. The Cabul River, which joins the Indus at right angles above Attock, Avas, at the time of the Aood, coming doAvn Avith a very uniform slope of tAvo feet per mile. But on meeting Avith the Indus Aood it Avas driven up stream at the rate of ten miles an hour. This back current, meeting the river coming doAvn, caused the Cabul to overflow both banks with great force, and inundate the mibtary station of Naoshera, which Avas almost destroyed. The people first got the alarm by seeing the river running the wrong Avay Avith a velocity greater than its downward current, but no exertion could avert the damage Avhich fol loAved. These floods are of frequent occurrence, though it is seldom that any of such severity as those of 1826, 1833, 1841, and 1858, have to be recorded. The obstruction AA-hich caused the flood of 1833 Avas due to the slipping of a glacier on the upper course of the Shayok River \u2014 the chief hill tributary7 Avhich joins the Indus after a course of 350 miles. The other floods Avere caused in a similar Avay, though at different places. Mr. HayAvard, in his explora tions in Gilgit during 1870, noticed a tem porary obstruction of this kind forming a lake in the Gilgit valley, in which valley7 also he believed the flood of 1858 to haA-e originated, though it has been attributed Avith more pro bability to a landslip near the sharp southward bend of the Indus, 70 miles beloAv Iskardo. A flood of a similar kind is said to have occurred on the Sutlej in 1872.* are also to be found, pointing to many of the rivers of the Avestern side of the Atlas having at one time been very- much larger than at present. Meanderings of a River. \u2014 The tendency7 of any riA'er is to run straight doAvn to the loAvest level, and in the first portion of its course, Avhere the stream is SAviftest, and its force greatest, it is less frequently meandering than Avhen it reaches fiatter ground, and has less poAver to overcome the obstacles Avhich deAect its current. This feature may be seen in all rivers, from a brook to the largest current. The current pressing against one of the banks undermines it and forms a concavity by the \" caving in\" of the bank thus excavated, round which the upper layers of the river play freely7, Avhile the under currents cany the sediment to the opposite bank, thus protecting it, for a time at least, against attack. If the sediment thus tossed from one side to another is thrown against a ridge of rock it will accumulate in the form of what is knoAvn in the rivers of North Western America as a Many rivers have permanently7 decreased from the causes already indicated (p. 8) \u2014 viz., the stripping of the country of timber \u2014 t Croumbie Brown: \"Reboisement in France\" (1876); '\u2022 Forests and Moisture \" (1S77) ; etc., etc. X Robert Brown, in Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Vol. XXXIX., pp. 121-131. and Vol. XLI., pp. 348-360; Begbie, in Proceedings Royal Geographical Society, Vol. XV., pp. 133-116. * Maclagan, in Proceedings ofthe Royal Geographical Society, 18S5, pp. 716-717."], [310, "298 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. \" bar,\" projecting into the current ; these bars \u2014 to be distinguished from similar accumula lations at the mouth of rivers \u2014 being favourite spots for the lodgment of the gold dust SAvept doAATi the river Avith the disintegrated rock in Avhich it has been contained (p. 106).

(After B. B. Woodward.) Cut-offs. \u2014 These conditions are seen to great perfection and on a huge scale in the Mississippi River, From the mouth of the"], [311, "THE '-CUT-OFFS IN A RIVER. 299 Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico it is 1,097 miles lone, though the distance in a straight line is about 600 miles less, its numerous flexures also reducing the rate of its descent to less than haft the inclination of the plain doAvn Avhich it floAvs. The immense curA-es of this stream in its course through the soft alluvial plain are such that, after traversing tAventy five or thirty miles, the voyager is brought within a mile or tAvo of the place he had before passed. During heav-y floods the Avater sometimes bursts through these \" tongues of land,\" or peninsulas, forming Avhat are called \" cut-offs,\" Avhich may become neAv and permanent channels, though the height of the banks and the great depth of the river check the frequent formation of these cut-offs. They have, hoAvever, been produced by artificial means, though the attempts at Bayou Sara in 1S45, and at Vicksburg in 1862-63, failed. Semi-circular lakes, Avhich are deserted river bends, are scattered all OA7er the alluvial tract of the lower Mississippi. They are haunted by alligators, Avikl-foAvl, and garfish, driven into the secluded places by the steam-boats on the main river. At high water the river Aoavs into these lakes \u2014 the Aigues-Mortes or Dead Waters of the French geologists \u2014 Avhen the Ioav country around is entirely7 submerged and looks like some A-ast lake with Avooded islands rising out of the flood. In other cases these \" aigues-mortes \" get gradually silted up, choked with vegetation, and in time become SAvamps, or marshy land. The river has more than once by bursting through one of these cut-offs shortened its course by 30 miles, and, by piling up sand-bars and forests in front of them, forced several toAA-ns Avhich were formerly on the banks into tbe country. The village of Delta, built three miles beloAv Vicksburg, is iioav, by a comparatiA-ely recent cut-off, tAvo miles above Vicksburg \u2014 a change in the reverse course, Avhich has also shut off both of these places \u2014 like Osceola, St. GenevieA-e, and others \u2014 from communication with the river. The boundaries of parishes, counties, and even of States, have in this manner been altered. In the morning a man might go to bed in the State of Mississippi and by dawn find himself and his farm in Louisiana ; Avhile, as a well-known American writer facetiously \u2014 though not less truthfully \u2014 remarks, such a thing happening in the Upper River in former days could (without either the serfs or their master having any voice in the matter), by transferring an estate from Missouri into Illinois, have manumitted the human chattels of a slave-holder. The Missouri, though not quite so wayward, is also rapidly wearing down the bank on its southern mouth, and altering its course accordingly7. The rivers of the Punjab act in an almost iden tical fashion. Not one of them is at any time exactly Avhere it was the y7ear before. The town of Mittan Kot, just before the com mon confluence of all the rivers, has tAvice (according to the ordinary Avay of speaking of it j been \" carried aAvay.\" In reality, though many buildings and much property on the banks of all these rivers are annually sAvept into the river, this is seldom done AA'ithout Avarning. When the people see what is inevitable they move farther back, or to some part of the river side that seems more secure. General Maclagan tells us tbat when survey ing in Upper Sind, and engaged in recover ing positions be bad mapped the year before, he missed a village that was on his books, and on inquiry it Avas pointed out to him on the other side of the river. The people, warned of Avhat Avas coming, had migrated over the Avater. The river had cut in more than half a mile from its bank of the year before.* Even in the comparatively small rivers of Europe this constant changing of the cha racter of the bed is seen, as the accompany ing- chart of the Danube at different dates sIioavs (Fig. 155). Something similar, though on a much smaller scale, has more than once happened with the Tweed, which, by altering its course, has transferred portions of a farm from Northumberland into Berwickshire, or, in other Avords, from England into Scotland.

Deflection of Rivers by Rotation of the Earth. \u2014 Like the Avinds, rivers, though more strictly bound to the soil than the atmospheric currents (Avater being heavier than air, and more sensibly affected by acquired momentum), exhibit a tendency, AA-hen flowing in a me ridional direction \u2014 from northward to south ward, or vice versa \u2014 at some distance from tbe Equator, to be deflected from their course by the rotation of the earth on its axis. This phenomenon is, hoAvever, much less marked than in winds, which, when they move from polar latitudes \u2014 where the velocity due to rotation is small\u2014 to more southerly zones \u2014 where it is greater \u2014 lag behind and get bent more and more to the AvestAvard, so that a Avind Avhich bleAv out of the north becomes, as it gets southward, a north-east one, and vice versa on the other side of the Equator, or from the opposite direction. Accordingly, Von Baer maintained that the Siberian rivers Avhich flow PoleAA-ard press upon their eastern instead of upon their western banks ; the con trary being the case Avith those whose course is in the opposite direction. Tivin and Inosculating Rivers, etc. \u2014 Some rivers, like the Obi and Yenessei, the Yang-tse- Kiang and the Hoang-ho \u2014 i.e., the Hoang-ho as it reached the sea prior to the floods of 1851-3 \u2014 the Euphrates, the Tigris, the Ganges, and the Brahmapootra, all rise close to each other, and fall into the sea in near vicinity, though in the interval they give each other a wide berth \u2014 a fact due chiefly to \" accidental\" circumstances connected with the contour of the country through which they Aoav. On the other band, it is quite common for rivers which rise in close proximity to each other to inosculate \u2014 or, as the anatomist terms it Avhen describing this condition of veins, anastomose \u2014 before they reach the sea. The Amazon and the Orinoco inosculate by means of the Kio Negro and the Cassiquiare. The very opposite arrangement is found in some of the rivers of North America. The Columbia and the Mackenzie, for example, arise so close together, that they receive tributaries from the opposite ends of the same lake in Athabasca Pass in the Rocky Mountains ; yet they flow in such diametrically opposite directions, that they look on the map like a line roughly drawn from the Arctic Ocean to the Pacific. The TAveed and the Cly7de, Avhich, during great floods, haA7e been knoAvn to inosculate by the inundation of the boggy ground at the Head of Biggar Water, also he nearly in the same straight line. The Irtisch is an example of the one phe nomenon, the Volga of the other. The first named river is said to have so cut into its right bank, that in 240 years one village has been shifted a mile to the eastAvard, and others driven back by the inroads of the current to an almost equal extent. The bank Avhich these rivers desert is Ioav ground having all the characteristics of an abandoned river-bed, while that upon Avhich they press is compara tively steep and high. To take an example from the American continent, the Mississippi River is sloAvly moAlng A\\-estward (p. 299). At Hard Times, a village in Louisiana, it is two miles AvestAvard of the line it used to take, so that the spot where this settlement formerly stood is not in Louisiana at all, but on the other side of the river in the State of Mississippi. Indeed, it has been affirmed, not Avithout scientific basis for the statement, that the course of the riA7er doAvn A\\-hich La Salle sailed more than two centuries ago is now dry land. In recent years, among minor incidents of the kind\u2014 though the fact has Rivers, in the course of the Avorld's history, have entirely altered their course. The Grande Coulee of the Columbia River is its old bed, and there has been much discussion over the question AA-hether, during the historical period, the Amii-darya (the Oxus) of Central Asia did not floAv to the Caspian instead of to Lake Aral, in an old channel into AAliich the Rus sian Government intend to divert it.

There is, on the other hand, some ground for believing that the tendency- of the Mackenzie, Avhich floAvs north into the Arctic Ocean, is to abrade its east more than its Avest bank, though the data on the question are too fragmentary and vague to admit of any thing like safe generalisation. The Nile in Egypt also encroaches on its eastern bank and deserts its left ; and many7 geologists belieA-e that at one time the Thames floAved nortliAvard from the Hope through Essex, but that, pressing continually on its right bank, it gradually Avorked its Avay through the clay ridge Avhich extends to the Stour, leaving extensive marshes on the left. Again, Professor Finger has pointed out that the Danube betAveen Vienna and Belsn-ad is act ing in a fashion very similar to the Volga. At the same time, it requires some faith to believe that the rotation of the earth has much to do with the deflection of riA-er currents and abrasion of river banks. It may influence them, no doubt ; though to the more apparent mechanical operations already described, or to be described in the next chapter, the phenomena noted may be more properly ascribed.* be regarded as a river which springs full gro-tvn out of the ground ; and no doubt the fable of \" Divine Alpheus, who by secret sluice, Stole under seas to meet his Arethuse,\" was founded on the mythologist's knoAvledge of some of these underground passages exist ing in the limestone regions of Greece; and possibly7 Coleridge's myth of \" Alph the sacred RiA-er\" in Xanadu, which ran \"through caA7ems measureless to man,\" Avas suggested by the same classic tale.

Dr. Clyde, avIio seems to hold this opinion, notes that Ercgli Lake, on the Anatolian table-land north of Taurus, not improbably finds an outlet for its surplus Avater in the Cydnus, south of Taurus. Another underground stream is the brook A\\-hicb, rising near Hebron, Aoavs by Gerar to the sea, and describes so deter minate an underground course that it is tapped at many7 places for the supply of the villages overhead. Again, the Guadiana, after floAving for thirty miles overhead, vanishes underground, and for the next thirty re appears only7 at intervals in the shape of lakelets \u2014 the \" oyos \" or eyes of the Guadiana, as they are called. Another good example of underground Avaters is afforded by the sub terranean streams AArhich drain from Lough Mask, in County Gabvay (Ireland), into Lough Corrib, and are exposed to vieAv at various places in their four-mile course, OAving to the subsidence of the limestone through which they have eaten their Avay (p. 277). An underground riA-er has, hoAvever, all the Underground Rivers. \u2014 From what has already been said regarding the poAver of subterranean Avater to erode rocks into caverns, it is clear that in many places rivers must flow for a considerable distance under ground. Springs do so, and between rivers and springs there is really no distinction in kind ; there is only one of degree. Some of these large springs or small rivers have already been noted (p. 277).

The Orange River, in South Africa \u2014 Avhich gives its name to the Republic through which it floAvs \u2014 contains cuprous matter, which renders it poisonous to fishes in part of its course, though its name is in honour of the House of Orange. In Algeria there is a stream inky black, and, indeed, only7 diluted ink, OAving to one of its tAvo tributaries being strongly impregnated with the iron which it imbibes from a ferruginous soil, and tbe other from meandering through a peat marsh, being equally rich in gallic acid, the tAvo principal ingredients of ink. The ancient Greeks ap plied the name black to several of their rivers, while the Homeric term \u2014 upyvpoSi'vrjs, \" silver eddying \" \u2014 applied to the Peneius, Avas due to the dirty-white earth of its OAvn banks, and for a similar reason the Achelous is called by the modern Greeks, \" Aspropotamo,\" the White RiA-er. f The many Rio Negros and Rio Blancos derive their names from their colour \u2014 the hue in the one case being frequently due to the decomposition of A-egetable matter, and in the other to earthy sediment in suspen sion. The Rio Colorado \u2014 the Red River \u2014 the Hoang-ho, or Yellow River \u2014 the White Nile \u2014 and the flaws Tiberis \u2014 the Yellow Tiber \u2014 g-et their designations from a similar reason, though the Niger is not so called because it is black : it is only a corruption of its native name, N-eg-hirreu, which means \" the river.\" The apparent colour of most rivers is, hoAv ever, generally- due to the bottom or to the banks reflected in its waters, when its current has not, as in so many of the Swiss streams, been rendered turbid from the glacier streams laden Avith the sediment of the ground-doAvn rocks OA-er Avhich the glacier crawls, or broAAm, as in the case of the Blackadder in Scotland, from the peat which may have been washed into it. For example, the Guaso N'Erok \u2014 i.e., the Black River of Masai Land \u2014 OAves its name merely to the black volcanic rocks over Avhich it Aoavs. % On the other hand, the so-called \" blue \" and \" green \" rivers are usually7 clear waters. Taste and Colour of Rivers. \u2014 As all water is naturally pure, anything which gives colour to a river must be of extraneous origin, derived from tbe soil, from tbe air, or from its tributaries, which again must have obtained the impurity from one or other of these sources. Hence the Salt RiA7er of Australia, or the Rio Salado and numerous saltish streams of the Argentine Pampas, must have imbibed their flavour by the feeders washing into them the saline efflorescence found so plentiful on the soil in these regions. The Athabasca receives a saline feeder a little beloAv its confluence Avith the clear Avater. It rises in a natural salt spring or lakelet of considerable size, and beloAv Lake Athabasca is a second saline feeder rising in the Cariboo Mountains, Avhich contain vast deposits of rock salt, and, according to the Abbe Petitot, a cavern remarkable for its crystalline concre tions.* A \"salt river\" is also one of the tributaries of the Great Slave River. In like manner the alkali (p. 42), which characterises some of the streams and lakes of Eastern Oregon \u2014 the Klamath Lake and its defluents, for example, \u2014 is washed out of the earth of the neighbouring country7. Water Avhich comes in contact Avith metallic ores undergoes a total change by7 admixture Avith acids, just as mineral and other medicinal springs, for exactly the same reason, are distinguished by various properties, due entirely to the sub stances Avhich have been dissolved during their passage through the soil or the rocks. The Rio de Vinagre \u2014 the \" Vinegar River \" \u2014 of NeAv Granada, in Central America, is sour * Sir John Richardson (\" Searching Expedition,\" Vol. I., p. 183) describes a thermal saline spring on the banks of the Mackenzie, with the fissure from which it flows encrusted with crystallised gypsum.

But it is evident, Avithout almost any geological knoAvledge, that the beds which they occupy, often far beloAv tbe level of their banks, have been excavated by themselves. The summit of the banks may, for practical purposes, be regarded as the level of the country through which the stream runs, and the distance between this and the bottom of the river the extent to which the current has scooped out the rocks and soil. However, rivers having a tendency not only to dig downwards, but to erode in a lateral direction, it is not always easy to fix upon the original banks of a river, or therefore to reckon in the rough-and-ready way described the extent of its denuding powers ; for, as Ave have seen, the holms and haughs between which it may at present Aoav have been actually formed of the detritus it has scooped from banks at spots in its upper reaches (p. 298), and not unfrequently the river has gouged out the broad valley, through the bottom of Avhich it floAvs. the gathering rills, Avhich soon broaden them into runnels and channels, and, undermining the sides of the furroAvs thus Avidened, play their part in denudation more actively than would otherAvise have been possible. Sometimes torrents work an enormous amount of destruction in a feAV minutes. In Abyssinia, for example, M. d'Abadie de scribes a valley as peaceful, and with no sign of trouble brewing in the serene sky, when suddenly \"a native, hearing a strange noise at a distance, which quickly increased, would cry out with all his might, ' The tor rent ! ' and, with all haste, clamber up upon the nearest height. Thirty seconds would not have elapsed when the bottom of the valley totally disappeared under a sheet of water, which sAvept aAvay with it trees, blocks of rocks, and ev7en Avild beasts. These tor rents, formed in a moment, exhaust them selves in the course of the same day, and leave no trace of their passage but cUbris of all sorts, and pools of muddy Avater retained here and there in the clefts and holloAvs.\" In the Himalayas, the torrents cut gorges through that lofty chain so deep that they admit the passage of currents of warm air from the south, and thereby modify the climate of countries lying to the north of the moun tains.

Larger bodies are naturally less easily moA'ed, since their Aveight, in the language of the geometrician, \"increases as the cube of any single dimension, while their surface, which gives a hold to the water, in creases only as the square.\" Hence, making exceptions for rounded bodies, which move more easily than square ones of smaller size, it has been calculated that a speed of 3 inches per second can move river mud, of 7^ per second small gravel, of 1 foot per second common sand, of 2 feet coarse ballast, of 3 feet large shingle, of 4 feet broken stones, and of 6 feet stratified rocks ; while a current floAving at the rate of 10 feet per second Avill dislodge and carry forward pieces of rock as hard and heavy as the igneous ones.

Niagara (Figs. 157, 158) is always cited as a good example of this erosion, the spot Avhere the Falls noAv are being seA'en miles from the spot above Queenstown where, it is evident, the water formerly7 tumbled over the cliff. The rate at Avhich this retrograde ex cavation is going on has been variously esti mated at from one foot to one yard per annum. At the former speed, five thousand years Avill carry the Horseshoe Fall far higher than Goat Island ; and, if this wearing away goes on Avithout stopping, it has been calcu lated that in time the chasm -will reach Lake Erie and loAver its level, or that the bed of the Niagara River Avill be worn into an in clined plane, thus changing the perpendicular fall into a tumultuous rapid. Mr. Wood- Avard, of \"Washington, is, indeed, inclined to consider that in 2,200 years the Falls Avill be practically at an end. This is probably a false conclusion, for, as the contour of the Falls, in their present position, is much greater than it could have been at any point beloAv, a much smaller body7 of water, less effective in force, is consequently7 passed over any given portion of the precipice, the current being also divided by Goat and Luna Islands. The river bed also increases in width above the Fall until it reaches Grand Island, which divides it into tAvo broad channels, thus greatly diminishing the weight and force of the falling water. From Lewiston upwards the average width of the channel is 1,000 feet. The present curve formed by the Falls and islands is 4,200 feet. Hence the water con centrated in mass and force beloAv the present Falls must have proved vastly more effective in disintegrating ana breaking doAvn the shale and limestone than it possibly can be at any point aboA-e. After receding half a mile farther, the curve will be more than a mile in It is easy to see that some rivers are con stantly engaged in this work. The Missis sippi, for example, is muddy7, as are also many of its tributaries ; and so turbid Avith mud are many rivers, like the famous Seboo of Morocco, which has shoaled up the old port of Mehdia, that a glass of it, if left standing for a few hours, Avill deposit a thick layer of broAvn sand and clay, leaving the Avater quite clear. But even the clearest of rivers is engaged in this wearing-away process.

Ev7en in temperate countries the extent to Avhich rivers wear away the soil is evident to any one Avho has watched a clear river, like the TAveed, roll seaward during a flood, its waters brown with the sand and clay Avashed from its banks ; though in tropical countries, Avhere sudden floods are the rule, this is much more marked. In reality7, the rivers on these occasions are often more mud than water ; and in Africa Livingstone speaks of the Zingesi \u2014 60 or 70 y-ards Avide and waist-deep \u2014 Avhich was made up of as much sand as water. \" In most rivers AA-here much wearing is going on, a person diving to the bottom may hear literally- thousands of stones knock ing against each other.\" The depth of a A7alley also affords in almost every case proof of the extraordinary erosiA-e poAver of rivers. But, though the result is in these instances evident, it is not often that Ave have an oppor tunity of seeing for ourselves the extent of this excavating power of running water. There is, hoAvever, a Avell-knoAvn case which illustrates this. \"We refer to the River Simeto, Avhich has cut for itself a passage 50 feet to 60 feet wide, and in some parts 40 feet to 50 feet deep, in a lava dam Avhich, during the eruption of Etna in 1803, was throAvn across the channel of the stream. The same form of the erosive poAver of riA7ers can be studied in the volcanic region of Auvergne (p. 119), Avhere numerous valleys have been excavated in the outpourings of lava so characteristic of that region ; and in the Eifel country (p. 133) the Moselle and its tributary streams have eaten deeply7 into the ground since they first began to take the courses in Avhich they at present flow. Lateral Erosion. \u2014 Rivers, however, Ave have seen, do not always run in a straight course, but Avhenever the fall is less than about 10 feet in a mile, begin to meander from side to side in the manner and with the results already noted (p. 297), the curve Avhich they make being proportioned to the size of the river. But much will depend upon the hard ness and other conditions of the strata through Avhich the river cuts its Avay, soft beds \u2014 as in the Mississippi Valley \u2014 giving Avay more readily before the current than hard ones. Hence, as in the case in question, the A7alley is very broad, while if the beds are hard, the lateral erosion is much less marked than the vertical. Mr. Tyler considers that the swift ness of a stream increases as the cube root of the volume of Avater, so long as the slope re mains the same, Avhile the wearing - away7 power of the river increases as the fourth power of its SAviftness. Hence, during a flood, Avhich increases the volume of a river twenty seven times its ordinary amount, the river * This account of the erosion of the Niagara Gorge is that held by nearly every geologist. However, of late. Dr. Julius Pohlman, Director of the Buffalo Museum, has ventured to doubt the received opinions, and, instead of accepting the hitherto universally-admitted view that the Niagara River originally fell over a hypothetical barrier, stretching from Lewiston Ridge to Queenstown Heights, from which the Falls have, in some 200,000 years, eaten their way back to their present position, contends that the gorge between the present Falls and the Whirlpool is older than the Ice Age. The only part of it he admits to have been excavated by the modern river is the three miles between the Whirlpool and Lewiston. Indeed, it is affirmed that the Falls, instead of cutting their way up the gorge from Lewiston, began as one cataract, not more than a mile or so from their present position. This thesis, though fortified by many facts and much ingenious reasoning, is. however, not sufficiently demonstrated to render the old one. and the data by which it is backed, so obsolete as its learned author would persuade us that it is. Another effect of the erosive power of rivers is that not only during their lateral erosion \u2014 that is, Avhen they7 attack the banks \u2014 they toss material from side to side (p. 299), but in time they eat through this very material, leaving it in the shape of terraces f Jukes-Browne : \" Physical Geology,\" p. 102."], [322, "310 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. on the sides of the valley, which they have formed. In Fig. 159 this is illustrated. At first the river floAved ' at the level indicated by the dotted line, a; then it Avorked its Avay doAvn to the level, b, cutting in its course through its old gravel beds, leaving only the patches av av' on either side of the valley. Still continuing its doAViiAvard erosion, the levels c and d Avere successively reached, and the river cuts its path through hard rocks it is not often that it has all its own Avay, the river crumbling down the banks, and thus tending to Aviden the gorge through which tho current runs. In a region where little or no rain falls, and Avhich is intersected by large rivers Avith a SAvift current, the contrary is the case.

These terraces are, however, not continuous all along the river valley7, being thus different from the benches or terraces to Avhich Ave have already alluded as marking ancient levels during a period when the physical geography of the country was someAvhat different (p. 297). Occasionally, too, some of these gravel and sand terraces will merge into each other, and form a continuous layer (av', x', y').* In the flat portions of the Rhine Valley these terraces of clay and gravel are very Avell marked. But they are also found at a height of from 400 to 800 feet above the present bed of the river, markedly distinguished by their long hori zontal ridges from the peaks formed by the Silurian clay slates through Avhich the river cuts, its Avay betAveen Bingen and Bonn.

Hence it is only at the depth of a foot or more that the seed finds the moisture fur nished by the melting of the snows \u2014 a cir cumstance Avhich compels the Moqui Indians to deposit the seeds of the maize at that depth beloAv the surface. In this region also are found the deep-riA-er cuttings, or \" canons,\" Avhich have of late years attracted so much attention (Figs. 3, 156). The rivers have steadily worn their Avay through horizontal beds of shale, sandstone, and limestone, the eroded edges of which can be seen on the side of the ravines, until, as in the case of the Great Cafion of the Colorado River (Fig. 3), there is a cutting some 300 miles long and about 10 Avide, Avith precipitous sides from 4,000 to 5,000 feet high, and at the bottom of the valley, or glen, another gorge 1,000 feet deeper, through which the river Avinds like a silver thread. All the endless tributaries of this river have minor canons, not so deep, but in several instances not less admirable specimens of the peculiar rocky cutting to Avhich this Spanish-American term of canon has been Canons. \u2014 River erosion is greatly aided by rain-fall.

If Ave do not accept some such explanation as that hazarded above, Ave are driven to conclude \u2014 Avhich is of course impossible \u2014 that these rivers at one time ran over land of much greater elevation at their mouths than tOAvards In carrying doAvn the load of sand, gravel, and other stones, the river not only grinds the rocks over Avhich it runs, but Avhen a pebble or other stone gets into an eddy, formed behind a ridge of rock stretching into the stream, it often forms a vertical \" pot-hole,\" or cavity, in the rock (p. 307). These pot-holes are similar to the \" moulins,\" \" Strudellbcher,\" or \" Riesentopfe,\" of the German, the \" Riessen kessel,\" or \" Giant caldrons,\" of the Scandi navians, Avhich are formed in the rocks over Avhich glaciers move, by7 the combined action ofthe Avater Avhich tumbles through the cracks, or \" crevasses,\" and the tAvirling of the stones \u2014 after the matter of a \" quern \" or hand-mill \u25a0 \u2014 Avith Avhich it meets.

Some of the estimates made as to the extent of this sedimentation have been incident ally noticed (p. 7). The great mud deposits Avhich have been left by the Rhine betAA7een Bale and Bingen shoAv that in one hundred years nearly six feet of deposit have been formed \u2014 a measurement Avhich corresponds very fairly with the estimate made, regard ing the amount of silt brought dcwn by the river. The Thames has been calculated to cast into the sea 1,865,903 cubic feet of sedi ment every tAA7elve months \u2014 a fact which accounts for the constant change Avhich its mouth undergoes, and the formation of fresh mud and sand-banks, rendering charts a year old as obsolete as if they were of the Georgian era. The Obi, Yenessei, and Lena \u2014 tbe three largest rivers of Northern Asia \u2014 carry in five hundred y-ears sediment enough to re-constitute 112 cubic miles of land in the Arctic Ocean ; while every year the Mississippi tosses into the Gulf of Mexico 3,702,758,400 cubic feet of mud, or, if heaped up in solid form, a mass one square statute mile 268 feet deep. This deposit is washed out of twenty-eight States and Territories \u2014 a drain age basin as great as the combined area of France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Turkey, witb the British Islands throAvn in. The Ganges deposits in the Gulf of Bengal 6,368,000,000 cubic feet of silt per annum ; and tbe muddy Irawaddy \u2014 which, after draining Burmah, falls into the sea by many outlets \u2014 cannot be far behind in the amount which it deposits to form the Ioav feverish islands which characterise the mouths of these great Asiatic rivers. The amount of sedi ment daily carried doAvn by the Danube varies much : on an average it is 67,760,000 cubic feet per annum. The Rhone deposits 38,890,464 tons, or 600,381,800 cubic feet;t and the Elbe, near its point of exit from the proportion to its size ; for there comes a time Avhen the power of vertical erosion is greatly lessened, if not entirely lost. This will happen when tbe bed of tbe stream gets ground doAvn so flat that the current has not sufficient impetus, or, as a sailor would say, \" purchase,\" to erode it to any extent. Then it will apply itself to lateral erosion, and, by this means, give itself that meandering course charac teristic of the loAver stretches of a stream. If, how-ever, the country- through AA'hicb the river flows is elevated in the manner which Ave have seen is so characteristic of some parts of tbe world (p. 168), the river will immediately re cover its erosive power \u2014 the difference betAveen the sea-level and its outfall being altered, the amount of rock and soil to be eroded being proportioned to the elevation of the country through which the eroding river flows. Such an elevation, it is believed, has been at work in the region characterised by the deep canons already described, this rise being one of the factors which has enabled tbe rivers to perform such an extraordinary amount of erosion. On the other hand, if the country7 sinks after the river has ceased to be a A7erti cally erosive power, or, as Major PoAvell * puts it, has attained its \" level of erosion,\" then the deposition of silt, and so forth, Avhich we shall presently see is among the most important of the geological functions of rivers, will com mence long before the stream reaches the sea.

For it may be taken as a rule tbat, Avhen a river is not utilising the gravel, sand, and mud Avhich it bears down for the erosion of the bottom, it is depositing it in the adjoining region Avhich it floods \u2014 as in the inundations of the Nile and the Missis sippi\u2014along the banks (p. 298), in the slack water near the mouth, where the current has not poAver to carry heaA-y material along, or in the sea, often at a considerable distance from land.

In this manner the Rhone is rapidly filling the Lake of Geneva (p. 7), and in the course ofthe riA7er and its tributaries many such obbterated lakes may be found. Filled-up lakes are met Avith abundantly in all mountainous coun tries, and, among others of the same kiud in Great Britain, that Avhich Mr. Browne notices at RosstliAvaite, above BorroAvdale, may be cited as a good example. A section through one of these riverine deposits (Fig. 161) explains the mode in which the strata are laid doAvn, and bears us out in inferring that false-bedded strata (p. 79) Avere formed in much the same manner ; these beds, if deposited in the sea or within the influence of the tide, being alternately fresh water and marine. It must also be re membered, in considering tbe poAver of rivers Fig. 161. \u2014 SECTION THROUGH A FLOVIATILE DEPOSIT. to transport debris, tbat all stones when sus pended in water lose one-third of their Aveight, and that the poAver of a stream to carry along material increases as the sixth poAver of the velocity of the current.

When two mud-laden rivers enter a lake from opposite sides, by their alluvia* joining, the lake may be divided into two. The lakes of Thun and Brienz, near Interlaken, are cases in point. These sheets are separated by a Ioav barrier, tAvo miles Avide, known as the \" bodeli,\" which is belieA7ed to have been formed in comparatiA7ely7 recent periods by the Liitschine floAving into Brienz, and the Lombach, Avhich noAv falls into Thun Lake. On the flat oround thus formed, Interlaken (\" betAveen the lakes \") and several villages are built. Finally, to take an example from North America \u2014 the Abbe Petitot tells us that the original mouth of the Athabasca is Deltas. \u2014 Such an enormous shifting of material from one part of a catchment basin to another must, of course, have a marked influence on the physical aspects of the regions affected. In that making and re-making of the Avorld Avhich are continually going on, rain and rivers are so constantly grinding doAvn the land, that were not the upheaving forces as regularly at Avork, the land Avould in time disappear into the sea. Meantime, the level ling-doAvn process is continuously in opera tion. If the upper Avaters of the river loAver the upper lands through Avhich it flows, the loAver portion of the flood will, by dropping these filched materials in its doAvnward course, raise the bottom of the river nearer its mouth, * Alluvium (Latin, lucre, to wash, and ad, together) is a term applied to material brought together by the action of water. Hence the operation of rivers is described as alluvial, and the soil so formed \u2014 that, for example, of the river-plains, known in the North as \" straths \" and \" carses,\" and in the South as \" dales \" and \" holms \" \u2014 is called alluvium.

Hence, for this, among other reasons, bars and deltas arc formed near the mouths of rivers. noAv distant a good day's navigation from the Athabasca Lake, into which it falls. Indeed, the river has actually filled up its oavii ancient estuary Avith the material it has carried along, just as tbe Volga detritus is advancing into tbe Caspian. The deposits, Avhen they fall into a lake or sea, spread out in a some- Avhat fan-shaped, or rather triangular, form An estuary, to use the definition of Dr. Ricketts* is a bay situated in Avhat has once been \" a narroAv valley7 or gorge, and, like a bay, is the result of a subsidence of the land by Fig. 102.\u2014 DIAGRAMS SHOWING RIVER DEPOSITS IN A LAKE. a, River ; b, Deposits c, Level of the Lake. (Fig. 162), Avhich, bearing a certain rough resemblance to the Greek letter A (delta), has received the name of Delta. Such deltas are seen in lakes, as the examples given shoAv (p. 313). But they are still more markedly seen in the comparatively tranquil seas into Avhich the great mud-laden rivers enter, for this, among other reasons, that the largest riA-ers of the Avorld enter the sea, and lakes soon get filled up by the deltas Avhich form in them. In rougher seas SAvept by currents, the detritus which the rivers bring doAvn is apt to be SAArept aAvay before it can form a delta. Avhich the river bed has been depressed beloAv the sea level, so that the Avaters till it up, in a similar manner to Avhat occurs if an embank ment is constructed across a similar narroAv portion of a valley, Avith the addition of the changes Avhich occur in the level of the Avater according to the state of the tide.\" \" Lochs,\" or fjords, Ave shall see are to a large extent of much the same nature as these firths, and, indeed, betAveen them and the first-named breaks in the coast-line there is really no definable difference, except that the upper portion of a firth usually narroAvs into an estuary, while a fjord is a narroAv glen, at the top of Avhich a stream takes the place of the glacier which once occupied the valley, or Avhich, in some cases \u2014 in the Far North \u2014 still forms the barrier at its upper extremity. An estuary is kept open by the combined in fluence of tidal currents and rivers. \" During the ascent of the tide a body of fresh Avater floAving seaAvard from the higher country is arrested in its course for several hours, and thus a large body of fresh and brackish Avater is accumulated. Then Avhen the sea ebbs, this is let loose, as in the removal of an artificial sluice or dam. By the force of the returning Avater, the alluvial sediment, both of the river and the sea, is swept aAvay, and transported to such a distance from the mouth of the estuary Bars, Estuaries, etc.\u2014 And here a feAV Avords of preliminary observation regarding tbe out fall of rivers are necessary. Some rivers, like the TAveed, for example, fall directly into the sea ; others, like the Severn, the Mersey, the Sohvay, the Clyde, or the Thames, form estu aries or ever-broadening mouths, Avhich gradu ally form inlets of the sea, as in the case of the Forth and the Clyde. When a river falls -directly into the sea \u2014 the Columbia is an apt American example \u2014 the doAvmvard current being opposed by the Avaves of the sea and the upAvard rush of the tide, the place Avhere these contending elements meet is marked by a barrier or bar of sand, mud, and gravel stretch ing across the river's mouth. Indeed, from numerous observations made by Durham and others, it is found that Avhenever fresh water laden Avith sediment meets salt Avater it tends * \"On Valleys, Deltas, Bays, and Estuaries\" (Pro* ceed ings of the Liverpool Geological Society, 1871 \u2014 72)."], [327, "BACKWATERS ; EXTENT OF DELTAS. 315 that a small part only can return Avith the next tide.\" * Asia, the Mississippi (Fig. 150) from America, the Nile (Fig. 151) from Africa, and the Rhine from Europe, all of which riA-ers find their way seaAvard through many7 comparatively narrow \" passes \" in the vast delta Avhich have formed around their mouths. The Mississippi \u2014 and it is a typical river \u2014 narroAvs as it approaches the sea. At the junction of the Ohio, and for a considerable distance downward, it averages a mile in Avidth. Then its breadth steadily diminishes, until at the \" passes \" it is little over half that Avidth. Sometimes the delta will take the form of an embankment, betAveen which the river Aoavs in a single stream. In this Avay the Shat-el-Arab mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates has since the daAvn of history- added 100 miles to its course. Deltas may even form in rivers far from their mouth by the deposits from their muddy tributaries, as, for example, at the confluence of the Rio Branco with the Rio Negro, in South America. The great plain of Lombardy has been formed by the Po, the united delta of which river and the Adig-e is 70 miles from Ostiglia to the Adriatic, where it extends for a breadth of 50 miles \u2014 the deposits, with those of the Brenta, the Piave, the Tagliamento, and the Isonzo, forming a marshy tract, extending from the Gulf of Trieste nearly to Ravenna. The changes which have been caused by this vast amount of sediment are shown by the fact that the once famous port of Adria \u2014 hence the Adri atic \u2014 has in less than 1,900 years been silted 20 miles inland, owing to that amount of delta bavins' been formed between it and the sea, where it was situated in tbe time of Augustus. As for RaA7enna, it is now four miles from the sea. The still more famous \u2014indeed the typical \u2014 delta of the Nile, the river which, even in the time of Herodotus, was regarded as the bountiful parent of Egypt, has made Memphis \u2014 where the sea once reached\u2014 a tOAvn 100 miles inland, all this great stretch of land being formed for the most part, as Sir Samuel Baker has proved, by the fertilising mud which has been derived from tbe disintegration of the rocks forming the mountains of Abyssinia, and has been brought down by the Blue Nile and the Atbara during the periodical inundations, Backwaters. \u2014 A bar Avill sometimes, Avhen much material is brought doAvn into a stormy sea, spread far from the original mouth of the river, and form a barrier along the coast, inside of Avhich the river may Aoav for several miles, or may form an extensive lake \u2014 like the Italian and Baltic lagoons \u2014 before breaking through and entering the open sea. A glance at the map of the American coast from DelaAvare Bay soutlnvard Avill shoAv Iioav the coast is, as it Avere, protected by a series of barriers of this character. The \" backAvaters \" of the Malabar \u25a0coast and other parts of Western India are also eases in point, and the curious breastAvork of Ioav islands Avhich are strung along the Dutch, German, and Danish coasts of the German Ocean may, in part at least, be regarded as of the same character, though some of them are remnants of a broken-up piece of the main land, and others are formed of old deltas. Extent of Deltas. \u2014 Whenever a river is per mitted to drop its load of suspended or dis solved sediment, it begins to form a delta, and continues adding to it until the accumulation rises above the Avater, and the river Avhich forms it Aoavs over the deposits Avhich it has itself laid doAvn. That of the Mississippi is estimated to be about 1,500 feet in depth ; a Avell has been sunk as high up as at NeAv Orleans to a depth of 620 feet Avithout reach ing the bottom of the alluvial deposits laid down by the river. The united delta of the Ganges and the Brahmapootra \u2014 Avhich covers an area of betAveen 50,000 and 60,000 miles \u2014 has been bored through to a depth of 481 feet Avithout the bottom being reached ; that of the Po is quite as thick ; and the surface of Upper Egypt has been calculated to have been raised by the Nile sediment 6 feet 6 inches since the Christian era. The deposition of a delta actually blocks up the mouth of a river, so that feAV of the rivers having great deposits of this kind find their Avay to the sea through one mouth. The Ganges and the Brahmapootra are examples from * See also Lyell's \" Principles,\" chap. xxi. ; and Green wood's '\u2022 Rain and Rivers,\" p. 107."], [328, "316 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. and spread over the alluvial plain of the delta. This delta is now 180 miles wide ; but, owing to the poAverful current which sweeps it, not a great deal has been added to it in the course ofthe last twenty centuries, though the material which is earned along the coast has helped to obstruct the mouths of Lakes Mariotis, Burlos, and Mensaleh, lagoons formed by some of the Nile mouths in the manner already de scribed (p. 315). the result that it is rapidly eating away its banks, and in time will cause a still greater disaster than that of Avhich it was the cause in the years mentioned.! The deltas of the Yukon, the Mackenzie, the Orinoco, and other great American rivers, might also be noted, as well as that of the Amazon, which, from shore to shore, including the Para mouth and the island of Joannes, is nearly 200 miles broad, while the vast extent of the deltas formed by the Siberian rivers has already been indicated. The delta of the Indus covers an area of\" about 3,000 square miles, and can be dis tinctly7 traced for a distance of 125 miles along the coast \u2014 a dead level throughout its entire extent. The Mississippi delta has an area of 12,000 square miles, which now forms a vast deposit, filling up AA-hat must at one time have been a deep estuary stretching up the Mississippi valley some 50 or 60 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, through which the river at present Aoavs, though beyond the edge of this dry or swampy bed there is still forming a great submarine delta, which will in time appear above the surface of the gulf in the shape of swampy7 islands, like those bordering each side of the \" passes \" (Fig. 150).* Compared Avith these gigantic land de stroyers and land builders, the little Euro pean rivers cannot sIioav any very extensive deltas. Yet some of them are sufficiently in teresting. The dreary flats through which the Rhine, so wildly picturesque in its upper reaches, creeps into the German Ocean bj7 a host of bifurcating channels, in which its waters mingle with those of the Sambre, the Meuse, and other Dutch and Belgian rivers, are, hoAvever, only a part of its delta : all the \" Loav Countries \" are, more or less, its offspring (p. 7), or the offspring of the Meuse, the Sambre, the Scheldt, and the other streams Avhich now \"Avander\" through it in the manner Avhich Goldsmith's lines so graphically picture. The \" Yellow Tiber \" is still as yelloAv Avith sediment as it was in the days Avhen the Roman poets so designated it, and has been steadily adding to the coast-line near Civita Vecchia some tAvelve or more feet of silt every year, so that the ancient Ostia, \u2014 the \" mouth,\" literally \u2014 is now no longer de serving of that name, for it is three miles inland. The great delta of the Danube \u2014 the joy of engineers and the soitoav of diplomatists, Avith whom rests the framing of regulations for the navigation of its intricate channels \u2014 has advanced into the Black Sea nine or ten miles during the Christian era. The Medi terranean is also affected by the many muddy Tbe great delta plain of the north-east of China varies in breadth from 150 to 500 miles, and extends for about 700 miles in a southerly direction ; yet it is as much the delta of the YelloAV River, and to some extent of the Yang tse-Kiang, as Egypt is the daughter, or, as Herodotus has it, \" the gift of the Nile.\" In this case, however, owing to the absence of currents and to the great quantity of mud brought doAvn by the YelloAV RiA7er, the delta is rapidly increasing, and the adjoining sea shoaling. The best proof of this is that the town of Pootai, which in the year 220 B.C. was one-third of an English mile west of the sea-shore, was in 1730 43i miles inland, thus giving a yearly encroachment of about 100 feet. Again, the town of Seen-shAvay, in the Peiho, was in a.d. 500 on the sea-shore ; it is now about eighteen miles inland. In 2,000 years the Yang-tse-Kiang has altered its course nine times, floAving into the sea by as many dif ferent beds. In 1851, 1852, and 1853, \" the Sorrow of Han,\" as the Chinese call it, over floAved its banks, submerging a country tAvelve miles AAlde, and forcing its waters into the narroAv channel of the Ta-tsing River, with * '\u25a0 Countries of the World,\" Vol. II. , p. 103. f \" Countries of the World,\" Vol. V., p. 26."], [329, "317 RATE OF RIVER DENUDATION. rivers Avhich discharge into it, and the Adriatic is filling up Avith the detritus of the Po and the Adige. The Rhine, in spite of its drop ping part of its load in Lake Constance, is every year bringing doAvn much material, though, OAving to the strength of tbe German Ocean, a great deal of this material is SAvept away and scattered over the ocean, instead of being deposited in a regular delta. Indeed, OAving to tbe embankment of Hol land, the real delta is in places below the level of the sea. At Leyden the unim portant arm of the river Avhich retains that name* creeps through the toAvn in a form practically undistinguishable from a canal, and destitute of any current except at Ioav tide, Avhen the sluices at Katwyk are opened. In consequence of a hurricane in a.d. 893, the mouth of the river at Katwyk (the \" old Rhine \") was so obliterated by sand, that from that period doAvn to 1817 its waters formed a vast SAvamp, now almost entirely7 drained. DoAvn to 1840 its overflow waters constituted the Haarlemmer Meer, a lake eighteen miles long and nine in breadth. It may be added that betAveen the Rhine and the Meuse the Avatershed consists of a low range of sand-hills. The delta at the mouth of the Rhone \u2014 though that river clears itself in passing through the Lake of Geneva \u2014 has in 800 years been in creasing at the rate of more than 9i feet per annum, so that since the Roman period from 77 to 116 English square miles have been formed. Tbe Po delta advances at the rate of 230 feet a year, and Professor Simony has shoAvn that the Traun is forming a delta in the Lake of Hallstadt, in the Salzkammergut, Avhich in seventy years has increased by 246 feet \u2014 a comparison of small things Avith great Avhich is sufficiently instructive.f A lake will sometimes fill Avith singular rapidity7. Take, for example, the Lake of Thun, already7 instanced. In 173 years the Kander delta is affirmed to have encroached on the lake to the extent of 203 acres, now in part covered with trees, though much of it is still in the condition of marshy meadows. The Aar has deposited a fan-shaped delta in the Lake of Brienz nearly 4,000 feet broad. It may be added that the accumulations forming the \" bodeli \" first descending from the south out of Lauterbrunnen Thai, and then from the north out of the Habkern Thai, are generally cited to account for the curve which the Aar has been compelled to describe. In tAventy-seven years the Reuss, on which Lucerne is situated, deposited in the Lake of Lucerne a delta containing, according to Heim, upwards of 141,000,000 cubic feet of sedi ment, Avhich indicates a deposition at the rate of nearly 19,350 cubic feet per diem. And yet tbe Reuss is, so far as mere size is con cerned, an insignificant river. The Amazon and La Plata, though forming deltas more or less marked, are so powerful in volume that, like the Rhine, they send a great quantity of the mud Avith Avhich they are charged far out to sea. Sabine fancied that he could detect the discoloured waters of the Amazon 300 miles from its mouth, and it is certain that its current can be felt in the sea at a third of that distance. The fact that the Challenger brought up land-derived de posits from 1,500 fathoms several hunJreds of miles from the nearest land shoAvs that rivers carry mud far out to sea Avhen the marine currents scatter it OA-er the bottom. On a smaller scale the same feature of rivers is exhibited in many other parts of the Avorld ; indeed, AA-herever a muddy stream Aoavs with considerable force into a moderately placid sea. Take, for example, the Achelous, Avhich w7e have already (p. 303) referred to as a river turbid Avith AA-hite mud. It is, as Homer aptly called it, the \" king \" of the Greek * The other arm (the Vecht) empties into the Zuider- Zee near Muiden. \u2022(\u25a0 Credner : \"Die Deltas\" (Petermann's Geographische Ali ft he ilungen, ~Ergiinzungsh.es t, No. 56, 1878). Anattempt has been made to divide deltas into those which, like the deltas of the Nile, the Orinoco, the Zambesi, the Niger, etc., fall into comparatively deep water (Ausfiillungs deltas), and those which, like the deltas of the Missis sippi, the Ebro, the Lena, the Yang-tse-Kiang, the Hoang ho, etc., form in shallowish water (Vorgefschobene-deltas), so that the river must find its way through them by many mouths. This classification will, however, not bear analysis. Peat, it is interesting to note, forms in many deltas by the decay of the vegetation on which the river has encroached during its floods."], [330, "318 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. Rate of River Denudation.\u2014 The rate at rivers. Rising more than 90 miles from the sea, aAvay on the confines of Macedonia, the \" Aspropotamo \" Aoavs in a SAvift course through some of the wildest, most mountain ous, and rainiest parts of Albania, draining, among other classic spots, the western declivi ties of the Pindus chain before it falls into the Ionian Sea, often a mile and a quarter Avide, during tbe wet season. All along its wild career the river demands its tithe of mud from its banks and bottom, and every runlet formed by the rains, and every tributary turbid Avith the tribute Avhich is exacted from the moun tain side, add to the AA-hiteness of the Achelous, until by the time its course is ended the river is in a position to drop a heavy load into the Mediterranean. This is evidenced by the exten sive flat about its mouth, partly pasture land, but chiefly7 morass and lagoon. EA-ery year the delta is growing, and in historical times has increased so much that, owing to the miles of now land formed, Sir Robert Playfair notes that the Avhole topography has been altered to such an extent as to make the identifica tion of some important ancient sites a very perplexing task. The turbid water can be seen far from the land, and the Echinades, a group of rocky isles, which rise out of the water, as the name expresses, like the spines on a sea-urchin or echinus, are already more than half surrounded by the deposit. Tho legend of the contest between Hercules and Achelous refers most likely to attempts made to restrain the inundations of the river within due bounds. In like manner the Wad-el-Kus of Morocco (the Lixus of the ancients) has so altered its estuary in modern times that it is difficult to trace historical spots, far less the garden of Hesperides which Pliny placed here* which the denudation is going on can only be estimated vaguely. Dr. Arch. Geikie has en deavoured to do it Avith more success than any one else. He calculates, for instance, that if a large river like the Mississippi carries off from its basin a mass of sediment Avhich, if uniformly spread out, would amount to of a foot every y7ear, that is, 1 foot in 6,000 years, Europe (supposing it Avas Avorn doAvn uniformly at this rate) would in 3\\ millions of years bo level Avith the sea. In valleys and mountain regions denudation is, hoAvever, much more rapid than this.

HoAvever, before touching on the influence of the sea in the formation of scenery, and the remarkable part Avhich Avater in the form of ice plays in sculpturing the earth, it is necessary7 to dwell for a little longer on one or two other features of rivers, more especially as they are of importance from a picturesque point of vieAV. Beds of rock, avc knoAv already, wear away under the action of the Aveather or other eroding agents with a ra- pidity proportioned to their relative hardness. Hence Avhen Ave find a series of strata of different degrees of hardness sloping in such a direction that they tend to reach the surface, their outcrop will in time develop a series of cliff's or \" escarpments,\" OAving to the softer beds mouldering into their component elements long before the harder ones are affected, though, of course, these escarpments will in turn re- cede, the rocks which give rise to them being in time acted upon by rain, river, and Avind, by frost and sun. For a time, hoAvever, a river floAving down such a slope Avill be broken by a succession of Avaterfalls or cataracts as its current passes from the hard to the soft rocks in its bed, the interval betAveen tAvo cataracts being occupied by a deep pool which the stream has worn in the soft bed. At the same time the main river would receive tributaries, Avhich floAved along the strike of the beds. This illustrates in a broad Avay the manner in Avhich many Avaterfalls are formed. But such falls are usually more of the nature of a suc cession of cataracts or rapids, broken by trans verse ridges, than true Avaterfalls of the striking character of Niagara (Fig. 158) ; of the Sno qualami, in Washington Territory7 ; or of the three of scarcely less magnitude Avhich \u2014 1<> keep to the United States \u2014 break the course of the Snake River in Idaho. Waterfalls. From change of Formation.\u2014 In a general Avay7, therefore, a Avaterfall \u2014 not a mere moun tain torrent \u2014 is caused by an abrupt change in the geological structure of the bed over Avhich a river runs. This may happen, as in the in stance already given, Avhen the beds are all on edge, or it may be effected almost as rapidly AA7hen the stream floAvs over the flat beds. Suddenly it changes from a hard to a soft stratum, which it will, of course, erode more rapidly-, and every year the erosive poAver of the stream will increase, OAving to the greater impetus Avhich the current derives from falling from a higher and higher elevation from the harder on to the softer rock. It therefore folloAvs, as Mr. Chisholm has pointed out,* that as granite and other hard rocks are found near the surface in those parts of the Avorld in which the deeper layers of the earth's crust haA-e been upheaved in the process of * \" Rapids and AA'aterf alls.\" in the Scott ish Geographical Magazine, Vol. I., pp. 101 \u2014 122.

Laufen and Bale occur Avhere the gneisses the Black Forest reaches to the SAviss shore of the river. Again, the Danube is constricted within the defile called the Iron Gate, just Avhere the river leaves the Hungarian plain, and passes the crystalline rocks and limestones of the Car pathians, a fact Avhich, though it does not bear directly on the occurrence of Avaterfalls, is of interest in studying the lateral erosion of streams.

In British Guiana the great Kaieteur Fall is caused by the Potaro River passing from a Sandstone Conglomerate to a softer Sandstone, the cataract being at present 822 feet high. mountain building, independently of the fact that this process is one which tends to harden rocks that are naturally soft, Avaterfalls are mostly, though by no means solely, met Avith in mountainous countries, since here those alter nations of hard and soft rock to which they OAve their origin are likely to be most frequent. Especially is this true of mountainous re gions in which the rivers cut right across the mountains \u2014 of those, for example, which inter sect the ranges of the Rocky Mountains, and of those Avhich traverse the Alleghanies. This fact again is in South America true of those tributary streams which cross the highlands on the north, east, and west, to join the great rivers of the plains \u2014 the Amazon and the Paraguay \u2014 and in Africa of the rivers which, in making their way from the interior plateaux to the ocean, have to pierce a barrier of moun tains. At the same time, rivers may flow for long distances unimpeded by rapids or falls when they follow the general trend of the mountains. The Amoor, which is navigable for half its length, and the Yang-tse-Kiang and other waterAvays are even more important cases in point ; Avhile the rivers of Southern China, such as the Si-Kiang and the Song-Ka, which have to cross the axis ofthe mountains, are fre quently interrupted by rapids and Avaterfalls. On the other hand, the tributaries of the east and Avest rivers, folloAving as they do the trend of the mountains, are unobstructed and often important channels of communication. It also folloAvs that the rivers running across the plains and prairies of America, Asia, and Europe, are seldom, if at all, impeded by the obstacles Avhich are the theme of this section, unless where, as in South America, granite veins cut across their course, or in Europe, where many of the Avaterfalls are over lime stone, gneiss, or granite. The Falls of the Rhine beloAv Schaffhausen, Avhich are the greatest in Europe, are over masses of lime stone (the so-called lacken), just where the river touches the Jura limestone before re entering on rocks of Post-Pliocene date, Avhich it had before quitted* and the rapids betAveen From Faults. \u2014 At the same time, though most falls are due to the causes of Avhich Ave have supplied some examples, they may, in exceptional instances, be traced to other reasons. For instance, the Glen Falls, near Saratoga on the Hudson, are due to a fault Avhich has raised three sandstone rocks above the level of the three next beloAv them in the bed of the river, though it may be noted tbat just here the river passes from the Tren ton Limestone to the Hudson River group of Shales and thinly-bedded shaly sandstones.

Examples of this kind of waterfall may be seen in Eng land in the LoAA'er Red Sandstone at Armath- Avaite above Carlisle. round this A-ast cataract columns of steam like spray rise to such a height as to be visible at a distance of more than tAventy miles. This Livingstone attributes to the large volume of air forced into the cleft, OAving to the manner in Avhich the water descends, and thus re bounding and rushing up loaded Avith vapour. It may be added that the loAvering of temperature, amounting to as much as 4^\u00b0, by the side of the Staubbach \u2014 \" The Dust Stream\" \u2014 in SAvitzerland, is ascribed to the loss of heat by the evaporation Avhich is pro moted by the finely-divided state of the water Avhen dissipated in the shape of spray. Rapids from Islands. \u2014 A rapid \u2014 that is, a part of the river where the current is much accelerated \u2014 may, in some cases, as in the St. LaAvrence, betAveen Kingston and Montreal, and in the Yenessei betAveen Yorogovo and Osinovka, be due to the current being inter rupted by numerous islands producing a great many channels Avith conflicting channels. Or a rapid may be caused by the river in passing through a region of hard rock, contracting its bed and \"making up for its reduced Avidth by increased depth and velocity.\" In travers ing the Ozark Mountains, the Mississippi passes through such a defile, though there is reason for believing that this defile occupies the site of a Avaterfall Avhich by the process of recession has been entirely obliterated (p. 307). Lakes. Barrier Lakes, etc.\u2014 If an embankment is thrown across the valley through Avhich a stream Aoavs, the dammed-up Avaters must, if they can find no other outlet, accumulate behind the barrier until a lake forms up to the level of the barrier, Avhen, of course, the surplus Aoavs aAvay in the form of a discharging stream. Thus, a lake of this kind is merely a temporary enlargement of the river's course, the defluent at one end being the continuation of the affluent at the other ; the lake between is only a portion of the river enlarged, OAving to accidental circumstances. In this Avay \u2014 the lakes of the Columbia, for example \u2014 a river may form a chain of lakes united in a series of links by short rivers floAving out of the one into the other. This is the simplest form of these natural features, though perhaps Ave are not justified in adding, the most frequent. We have seen (p. 281) that landslips and earthquakes (p. 247) very often form more or less temporary lakes of this description. More lasting ones are due to old moraines, that is to say, the earth, stones, and other rubbish Avhich a glacier bears along, and de posits at its terminal end, acting as the dam across the valley through which, in early times, it craAvled. These moraine lakes are usually found in the loftier elevations, e.g., in the Innethal above the outfloAv of the Inn, in the Northern Limestone Alps, at Kusstein, in the Middle Ennsthal, at the outfall near the Gesause, in the Pongau where the Salzach From Fissures.\u2014 Lastly, the Victoria Falls in the Zambesi (Fig. 164), which fall into a chasm across the river bottom, are due to none of the causes described, but to some volcanic or other terrestrial convulsion by which a rift has been made in the hard basaltic rock which there forms the bed of the Zambesi. The tAvo parts of the bed thus riv-en asunder shoAv no difference of level. The water simply vanishes doAvn the chasm, and on the opposite side of it grow grass and trees where once the river ran, as Livingstone tells us, on the same level as that part of its bed above the falls. The depth of the chasm is about 360 feet and the breadth betAveen eighty and ninety, and into this gulf the river, a full mile Avide, rolls with a deafening roar to escape through an opening situated at right angles to the fissure of the falls not more than twenty or thirty yards wide, from whence it continues its course through a succession of similar narrow chasms, which take the form of a sharply angular zigzag line.* All * Livingstone : \" Zambesi,\" pp. 252-5.

Beavers also, by forming dams, Avill often cause lakes to accumulate. outfall of the Zirknitzer See in the Karst, a subterranean channel is so rapidly enlarging that in time the lake -will be drained faster than it can fill, and its bed be traversed by7 a stream running through a deep A-alley. It may also happen that there are transitions betAveen the one and the other (p. 333). Glacier Lakes. \u2014 The lakes described in the preceding paragraphs, though no doubt the most easily explained, form by no means the most striking of their order, nor, in Northern countries at least, the most common accumulations of Avater. A more frequent kind are those enclosed in rock basins \u2014 holloAvs surrounded on every7 side (except when they are broken to admit of the surplus water draining aAvay) by7 solid rocks, lying in regular beds, as they Avere originally laid doAvn, and not held back by dams of loose and more or less foreign material. The Cumberland lakes are, for example, lying in holloAvs of this description. It is therefore clear, unless we can proA-e that the Avater is kept in a basin formed by tbe folding of the strata, that the cavity must have been holloAved out by some other agent than the rivers Avhich have scooped out so many valleys. What then has gouged out the basins of so many of the lakes in the hilly parts of England, Ireland, Scotland, Scandinavia, and North America ? The sur face has not sunk unequally, for the beds are not parallel to the bottom of the lake, but at all possible angles to it. Accordingly, after ex hausting all other methods of explaining their formation, and shoAving that none could apply, Sir AndreAv Ramsay has invoked the aid of ancient glaciers. Ice, Avhen it has entered a holloAv, will grind on by the pressure of the mass in its rear until it creeps up hill, and may even, if the slope is not too steep, be forced out again. During the Glacial Period, Avhen the country Avas covered Avith ice, this agent must have played an important part in the formation of such cavities. Glaciers cut out the basins they entered into, till, Avhen the great sheets cleared away, such lakes as those of Maggiore, Lugano, Como, Iseo, and Garda, bounded by7 mountains on the north, west, and east, and by Ioav rock barriers on On the other hand, Ave have seen that old volcanic craters afford space for the accu mulation of lakes Avithout any visible outlets (p. 133), and little lakes, or \" tarns,\" are some times accumulated in the holloAvs of the \" drift \" left from the last Glacial Period. In great lava fields, like those of Iceland, hol- Ioavs sufficient for the accumulation of con siderable sheets of Avater form (p. 147), and Mr. Green ventures the belief that the re markable lakes in the Jordan A'alley (Merom, Galilee, and the Dead Sea) AA-hich lie far beloAv the present level of the Mediterranean, have originated in an \" unequal elevation of the earth's surface,\" the land at the loAver end of the gorge, through Avhich the riA-er floAvs, being elevated until a barrier Avas formed, Avhile higher up the movement gradually changed into one of depression until a considerable part of the valley Avas sunk deep beloAv the sea-level. But the depression being greater at some spots than at others, profound hollows were formed along the course of the stream noAv occupied by the lakes in question. In Cheshire, the same excellent geologist notes that lakes have been formed by the dissolving aAvay of the beds of rock-salt Avhich are con tained in the NeAv Red Marl. Into the cavities thus formed the OA-erlylng rocks sink, and so depressions, soon filled Avith Avater, are made on the surface. The lakes Avhich accumulate in the old channels of the Mississippi may7 also be noted (p. 299), though, as they receive no regular supplies, nor possess any regular outlets, they soon get choked up with herbage, and through the intermediate stage of sAvamp become moderately dry land. We thus see that valleys become lakes, and lakes may in time return to valleys.

Brienz and Thun, Lucerne, Zug, the Wallen-See, Zurich, Constance, and Neuchatel, all lie in rock basins of the ice-eroded order; Avhile the Todten-See, Sarnen, Lungern, and many other minor sheets of Avater, are visibly bordered by glaciated rocks. Most of tbe Scandinavian lakes are of the same type, Avhile in nearly every part of the Northern Hemisphere where glacial action is evident these ice-scooped lake basins are found. Sir AndreAV Ramsay will even class the lakes of Finland among the number, though Baron v. Nordenskjold avers that they keeping with all the broad facts of the case had better be accepted.! Even those who deny the influence of glaciers admit that lakes, like rivers (Fig. 177), often originate from Ramsay, Quarterly Journal ofthe Gi Society, 1862, p. 189. f Professor Heim, who denied that the Swiss or any other large lakes could have such an origin, whilst Pro fessor Penck held the contrary, now admits that tho Bavarian lakes are most probably glacial excavations in gravel deposits. On the other hand. Dr. Penck is of opinion that dislocation, in the process of mountain build ing, had an essential share in the formation of the Lake of Zurich, although ice may have given it the finishing touches. Forel affirms that the Lake of Geneva is nearly divided in two by a great moraine."], [338, "326 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. streams floAving from under glaciers. But with out placing too much weight on this, it must necessarily7 be true that the causes which ope rate in the formation of valleys Avere at work before the process by which the lake basins Avere holloAved out began. For the movement of a glacier is like that of a river through a A-alley. It is therefore possible to alloAv that a valley Avas formed by dislocation of the strata, and that subsequently the glacier, preceded possibly by a stream, completed its holloAving. at one tim3 fresh, but by subterranean move ments the drainage of a large area of country has been altered until at present the supplies of fresh Avater Avhich reach it and the evapora tion from its surface being about equal, the Avater has been gradually getting salter. At one time it is thought to have occupied \u2014 not the 2,000 square miles of its present area, but a much more extended track, the outlines of which can be traced by the terraces marking its gradually decreasing circumference. This hyjj-othetical lake, to Avhich Mr. Gilbert has applied the name of Bonneville, is thought to have been fully 200 miles long, and about 180 in breadth, to have been fresh and to haAre drained into the Pacific by the Snake and Columbia Rivers. This period Avas immediately after an interior basin had been formed by the elevation of the Cascade Range. Lake La hontan of King Avas another hypothetical sheet of Avater dating from the same period. It lay to the AvestAvard,-): and Avas not much inferior in area to Bonneville. After the meteorological revolution which caused the Avaters to shrink beloAv the level of their outlet, their salinity began and has increased up to this day, Avhen chloride of sodium forms the chief solid in gredient in tbe Avaters of the Great Salt Lake. Lake Lahontan, hoAvever, seems to have de siccated entirely before its disappearance : the present lakes of the Great Basin, Pyramid, Winnemucca, &c, are of comparatively recent date, and are nearly fresh, for the reason that the salts deposited when the old lake evapo rated Avere buried or absorbed by the clays and marls that occupy tbe bottom of the basin. Even noAv the region occupied by these ancient lakes and their successors is repulsive enough to justify the geological story which attaches to them. The Great Basin stands, in nearly all its scenic features, in marked con trast Avith the remaining portion of the United States. The open grassy parks and heavily-timbered mountains of the Pacific slope, or the rounded, floAving outlines of the Salt Lakes. \u2014 Whether a lake is salt or fresh depends entirely on circumstances. If the amount of Avater floAving in is equalled by tbe evaporation from the surface, a lake may receive continual supplies of fresh Avater and yet maintain its average level Avithout finding any outlet. But in this case it -will be salt, or, at least, not fresh, since the river Avhich feeds it carries into its basin the saline materials which they have dissolved out of the soil ; and as these solid materials do not disappear in evaporation, they must accumulate in a lake Avithout an affluent. This Ave see very aptly in the tAvo great lakes fed by the Jordan, in Palestine. The Lake of Tiberias (the Sea of Galilee)* is fresh, because the Avater Avhich the Jordan pours in at one end is poured out by the same river at the other extremity. On the other hand, the Dead Sea (Figs. 2, 165),t at the farther extremity of the same valley, is naturally salt, because it has no outlet, re quiring none since it has no surplus Avater, the amount Avhich the Jordan pours in being more than draAvn off by evaporation. Indeed, the lake is gradually getting smaller, OAving to the fact that the supply from the earth is not quite equal to the demands of the sun upon its sur face. Hence, also, it must be getting salter, though already the Avater is intensely bitter and salt, the chlorides of sodium, magnesium, and calcium, being the chief ingredients in it, and its density so great that the human body Avill not sink in it. This, also, is the cause of the intense salinity of the Great Salt Lake of Utah in North America. Like so many other salt lakes, this sheet Avas, no doubt, | It was situated mostly within the area now forming the State of Nevada, while Lake Bonneville embraced almost entirely the present territory of Utah. \u2014 Russell's \" Geological History of Lake Lahontan.\" (United States Geological Survey Monograph, xi.) * 682 feet below the Mediterranean. f 1,292 feet below the Mediterranean."], [339, "SALT AND ELEVATED LAKES. 327 forest-croAvned Appalachians disappear, and the scenery suggests nothing of the boundless plains immediately cast of the Rocky Moun tains, or of the rich Savannahs of the Gulf States. It is more like the parched and desert areas of Arabia and the shore of the Dead Sea or the Caspian. It is a region of interior drainage. No stream that runs within it carries its contribution to the ocean ; and the climate is so dry that the yearly pre cipitation does not exceed an average of twelve or fifteen inches. The area thus isolated from oceanic Avater systems is 800 miles in length from north to south, and nearly 500 miles broad, and contains about 208,500 miles. At the south the valleys of the Great Basin are loAv-lying, Death Valley and the Colorado Desert being beloAv the level of the sea. But at the north Mr. Russell describes the valleys as having a general elevation of from 4,000 to 5,000 feet, Avhile the intervening mountain ranges rise from 5,000 to 7,000 feet above them, rugged and angular, usually unclothed Avith vegetation, and marvellously rich in colour OAving to the purple trachytes, deep-hued rhyolites, and many-shaded volcanic tuffs, Avhich often rival the brilliant tints of tho Ncav England hills in autumn. The valleys or plains separating these mountains are often deserts, totally destitute of Avater and trees for many day7s' journey ; the grey-green sage brush (Artemisia) alone giving character to the landscape. Many of them have at their loAvest depression \" playas,\" or simple mud plains, left by the evaporation of former lakes, that must have been in some cases of A7ast extent, the places Avhich they occupied being noAv often for hundreds of square miles destitute of anything Avorthy the name of vegetation. In Avinter, portions of this area are occupied by shalloAV lakes, but during the summer months they become so baked and hardened as scarcely to receive the imprint of a horse's hoof, and so sun-cracked as to resemble tesselated pav-e ments of cream-coloured marble. Other por tions of the valleys become encrusted to the depth of several inches with \" alkali \" (p. 42), Avhich rises to the surface as an inflorescence, and takes the appearance of drifting siioav. This dry surface material of the desert is some times bloAvn about by the Avind, saturating the air Avith alkaline particles, or is caught up by7 whirlwinds and carried to a great height, form ing holloAv columns of dust. These swaying and bending columns, sometimes tAvo or three thousand feet high, rising from the plains like pillars of smoke, form a characteristic feature in the desert of the Great Basin.* Elevated Lakes. \u2014 It is therefore evident that the mere fact of a lake being salt is no proof Avhatever of its having, according to a widespread popular idea, been at any period of its history a portion of the sea. At the same time, there is just as little doubt but that at one time some saline sheets of Avater in the interior of continents have been part of the ocean This, Ave have indicated, does not hold true regarding any portion of the Sahara, and it is more than doubtful Avbetber the Chotts \u2014 those marshy lakes in the interior of Tunisia, which lie beloAv the lev-el of the Medi terranean, and Avhich M. de Lesseps proposed to flood \u2014 Avere ever part of that sea. They are rather lakes Avhich, haA'ing no outlet, have become salt, and are gradually decreasing or drying up. But if many7 parts of tbe Medi terranean, German Ocean, or Baltic, Avere elevated a few fathoms they Avould become hill and dale, the dale being, in A-arious cases, closed basins filled Avith salt lakes. That this has, in more than one instance, been the origin not only of salt- but of fresh-Avater lakes is rendered probable by a variety7 of circum stances. The great Russian lakes Ladoga and Onega are, to all intents and purposes, mere prolongations of the Gulf of Finland, leading northward to the White Sea, the intervening land having been converted from a Avater channel by a very slight elevation of the region in question. Again, many of the Scan dinavian lakes could have been portions of the Baltic when tbe coast Avas lower than at present, and eA-en noAv a comparatiA-ely slight rise of the land Avould convert the Baltic into a lake. But in the Northern Hemisphere no sheet of salt Avater thus enclosed could long remain salt. It must, OAving to the wet * Science, Vol. X., Aug. 12, 1SS7."], [340, "328 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. character of the climate, be amply fed by streams, and as tbe evaporation in these very damp parts of the world is comparatively small, the surplus Avater would find an outlet by means of overfloAving riArers. Hence a circulation of fresh Avater being established through the lake it Avould speedily lose its original salinity. What is more, in some fresh- Avater lakes \u2014 in North America, for example \u2014 marine Crustacea still live, having been gradually- able to adapt themselves to the altered conditions of life caused by the slow change of the medium in which they exist from salt to fresh water. The same facts hold true regarding some of the SAvedish lakes tp. 169). Again, Lake Baikal, a fresh-water sheet, contains a large number of salt-Avater types of animals, just as Lake Superior does. In the latter case Ave are justified in conclud ing that at one time the great North American lakes were portions of the Atlantic, and that in the former instance Baikal was a deep pool of the Caspian. Indeed, the species of animals in the two sheets \u2014 the one salt and the other fresh \u2014 are identical. Among these animals is, hoAvever, a peculiar species of seal (Phoca sibirica), which is different from that in the Caspian (Phoca caspiaca) \u2014 though the con trary is sometimes affirmed \u2014 and many salt- Avater types of fishes. All over the plains between the Caspian and the Sea of Aral, and betAveen tbe latter sheet and Lakes Balkash and Baikal, there are deposits of shells, many of which are recent and identical with the mollusca liA'ing in the Caspian. Apart there fore from the proofs Avhich Ave have of eleva tion and desiccation in that region, these data go far to prove that at one time Central Asia was dotted by sheets of salt water of far greater extent than any of those dwindling marine representatives Avhich remain to this day. plorations on the borders of Tibet, found that the western part of the Lob Nor, Avhich has no outlet, Avas fresh, from which he concluded that it Avas a reedy sheet of no great depth ; but the eastern part of it is salt, all the matter contained and dissolved in the Avaters of the Tarim being carried into it ; and all through this region saline marshes are found, such as those dreary and desolate ones on the plateau of Tsaidanx* Here also the drifting sand and dust accumulate around the shrubs and bushes, and thus in process of time a small hill is formed, on the top of which a new shrub begins to groAv. Von Richthofen has shoAvn that these masses formed by the Avind are distributed over a wide area in Central and Western Asia, and that the form of the sur face of this region is principally due to the action of the wind, rain, and rivers being to a great extent absent, Avhile glaciers could not, except in very high lands, play a very im portant part in the sculpture of the land. Desiccation is, hoAvever, still going on. Accord ing to Nikolsky, Lake Balkash is drying up at the rate of over three feet in fourteen or fifteen years. Its evidently detached southern portion called Ala Kul \u2014 iioav separated from it by sand \u2014 is being transformed into a salt pan similar to Kara-Bugaz, the Avell-knoAvn bay on the east side of the Caspian. As the evaporation is very rapid in these regions, and the bays have no tributaries, the loss of Avater is replaced by the salt Avater of the lake rushing through the narrow entrance into the bay, the Avater of Avhich having become concentrated, the salt is continually being precipitated to its bottom. Its north or north-Avest shore is raised above the lake in a series of terraces covered with a sandy steppe, through which no river runs into the lake, the largest one flowing in this direction, the Tokran or Aitek, being absorbed by the sands before it can reach the beach. The Ayaguz only reaches the lake Avhen flooded. The southern shore has an entirely opposite character, for in many places the change from dry land to Avater is so Oscillations of Lake Level. \u2014 Desiccation. \u2014Vast tracts of Central Asia are covered Avith drifting sands. In some cases, these sands may be due to causes similar to those which produced the Sahara Desert (p. 8). But in other instances, they are almost certainly the arenaceous bottoms of dried-up salt AA-ater lakes (Fig. 166). Prejevalsky, during ex- * Salt lakes also abound.

Some other lakes of Western Siberia and the Aralo-Caspian region are also drying. In the Aral itself the rate of diminution is about 1*3 inch per annum. But JadrienzeAV, by comparing Lakes Sunny, Abyshkan, Molokoi, and Chany, in the governments of Tobolsk and Tomsk, as represented in the maps of 1748, 1813\u201420, 1850\u201460, and 1880, proves that they are drying up at a much more rapid rate. Lake Abyshkan measured 530 square miles at the beginning of this century : noAv only three small ponds of one and a half miles in width remain. The same process is going on throughout Western Siberia. * Seiches. \u2014 This local SAviss term has been employed to designate those vibratory oscilla tions of level which have been noticed in several Saviss and other lakes. In the Lake of Geneva their range is from three to as much as seven feet. Sometimes the Avaters will re main for twenty-five minutes or more above their normal level, then descend, and again rise, this vibration being continued for some time. Subterranean movements have been said to be one of the causes of these oscil lations ; though the general belief seems to be that they are due to atmospheric disturbances, particularly local storms \" Avith a vertical descending movement.\" The seiches in the Lake of Geneva, as in that of Constance, usually occur at particular spots where the bed of the lake contracts, and arc more frequent at night than during the day, and in spring and autumn oftener than in summer, and are most marked Avhen the sun \"suddenly begins to shine from amidst heavy clouds.\" These oscil lations are in no Avay connected Avith the vary ing levels of lakes at different periods of the year, those in the Lake of Geneva being con nected Avith the supply of water from melting snoAV, Avhile the currents, or \" ardyres,\" are due to the rising of subterranean springs. The seiches have been observed in every Swiss lake in Avhich they have been looked for, and in all probability they are to be found in all lakes, and must be ascribed to a variety of causes, though for the present it is idle to affirm that any particular explanation Avill account for every phenomenon connected Avith them. Very recently, Mr. Russell has noticed them in Lake George in Ncav South Wales. This sheet is about eighteen miles long, five Avide, and fifteen or tAventy feet deep. Its oscillations rise from tAvo to six inches, and are of tAvo periods \u2014 the longer being two hours and eleven minutes ; the shorter one hour and tAvelve minutes. In most cases the motion is connected Avith the passage of The mollusca of the Caspian and the Black Sea are in most cases identical, as are also the species in shell banks stranded on the isthmus between the tAvo seas; though the surface ofthe Caspian is Sol- feet beloAv tbat of the Black Sea. The slightly saline Sea of Aral \u2014 242'7 feet above the Caspian \u2014 seems also to have been at one time part of it ; its disassociation of this, like the other sheets of Avater in question, being due to terrestrial movements Avhich have changed the level of the country ; though to some degree also OAving te the general desicca tion. Even the rivers which once fed Lake Balkash have dried up or lose themselA7es in the sand before reaching its basin, so that its only feeders are from the mountains on its southern aspect. Salt Avater lakes sIioav, hoAveA-er, an oscilla tion of level, AvheneA7er the exact balance betAveen evaporation and supply is disturbed. The Great Salt Lake of Utah exhibits this. In 1849, its leA7el Avas eleven feet loAver than in 1877, the rise being attributed to the in creased rainfall caused by tree planting, and the greater amount of rain. This, hoAvever, was probably a mistake, for from 1866 to the present date the level of the lake has been gradually falling, the Avater receding from broad flats formerly covered, but noAv * Boas, in Science, Vol. IX., No. 210, Feb., 1S87, p. 129 ; Wood, Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, 1875, p. 367 ; and \"The Shores of Lake Aral\" (1876). pp. 102 116, where the whole questions connected with the Aralo- Caspian basin are fully discussed. \\ Jackson : \"Les Variations du Grand Lac Sale,\" Bul letin de la Soc. de Geographic de Paris, Maj-, 1880, pp. i 1 7-25."], [343, "TEMPERATURE OF LAKES. 331 thunder storms ; but at other times it seems to arise from repeated and Avell-timed im pulses of a less apparent form. For example, on one occasion Avhen the lake Avas very7 quiet, the Avater suddenly rose an inch and fell again within thirty minutes, then it arose an inch and a half and fell tAvo inches in three-quarters of an hour ; next it rose two inches and fell three and a haft inches in one hour ; finally it rose three and three-quarter inches in forty minutes, and so started a series of pulsations which settled doAvn to two-hour intervals and lasted twenty hours. the Lake of Geneva is in autumn 78c at the surface and 41 -7\u00b0 at 950 fret ; in February it Avas 42 1\u00b0 at the surface and 41 3\u00b0 at a little over 1,013 feet ; Avhile in a host of other lakes the summer temperature at depths varying from 174 to 600 feet runs all the way from 40'8\u00b0 to 42'0\u00b0. In brief, permanent masses of cold Avater, out of reach of' the influence of the sun's ray7s, seem to lie at the bottom of all, save the shalloAvest sheets. Hence, lakes equalise the temperature ; the mean annual tempera ture of the Lake of Geneva being at its surface nearly 4\u00b0 higher than that of the air, and Hildbrandson shows that the great lakes of SAveden exercise an equally important in fluence on the climate of Scandinavia. OtherAvise, large fresh-Avater lakes are sub ject to small variations of level. The supposed exception to the rule is supplied by Lake Tanganyika, in Central Africa, Avhich Avill often fall tAvo feet in two months, and has been knoAvn to fall ten feet in seven months. This is due, however, to the fact that the lake is fed by streams Avhich gather the rainfall of a com paratively small catchment basin, so that in dry seasons the lake, receiving little Avater from its almost dried-up tributaries, its out let gets choked by rapid growth of vegetation, so tbat it is not until the waters of the lake have risen to a considerable level that this dam gets broken doAvn, and the surplus water obtains free course* Finally7, it may be added, that lakes, from their tendency to get filled up by the rivers feeding them, cannot Avell be of great geological age. But they7 are, nevertheless, a true part of the river system, for if they do get obliterated by the agents on Avhich they depend, the river itself tends to disappear, by7 its bed being choked or altered in the various Avays avc have already studied. It may also be noticed that in very hot and dry countries lakes cannot easily7 exist at a very Ioav lev7el, since the evaporation is so great that in a hot valley, say7 in Peru or in Nevada, it would soon disappear. But when a high elevation is reached, the climate partakes someAvhat of the Northern characteristics. Hence we find Titicaca at 12,500 feet and Koko Nor at 10,500 feet above the sea, while in the Northern Hemisphere many of the princi pal sheets of fresh Avater are not elevated more than a few feet above the sea or separated from it by more than a narrow isthmus, t Temperature of Lakes. \u2014 Observations made in the SAviss lakes shoAv that after 400 feet have been reached the temperature does not Arary much \u2014 the bottom, even AA-hen it is at 1,000 feet, being only one- or tAvo-tenths of a degree different from Avhat it is 600 feet higher up.

What has already been said on the subject of lake and river erosion renders any lengthened account of valleys and their mode of formation superfluous. For, Avith feAV exceptions, all valleys have been eroded by rivers, and most of them are still being bolloAved out or rendered broader by the streams Avhich Aoav through them. Yet this fact, noAv almost universally recognised, Avas for a long period not very self-evident to the many Avriters who have discussed the origin of valleys. It was Avith them a question whether the rivers had scooped out the holloAvs in Avhich they run, or Avhether the drainage of the country had taken advantage of pre-existing IioIIoavs. Those Avho advo cated the latter idea contended that in some Avay the sea had gouged out the valleys, though, as Ave shall see in the course of the next chapter, the Avaves can act in no such Avay, Avhile the ocean beloAv loAv-Avater mark has a very slight erosive poAver. Again, from the fact of valleys often lying betAveen moun tains or separating ridges, it Avas thought that they Avere due to the convulsions Avhich had led to the upheaval of mountain chasms, or to the contortions Avhich the strata had undergone. On this vieAV the anticlines (p. 74) would be mountains, and the synclines valleys ; though when it Avas evident, as in Wales, that thousands of feet of rock had been removed by denudation since the contortion of the strata took place, the idea that many of the existing systems of minor valleys had been formed either by fractures or by unbroken curvatures of the strata Avas untenable. * Exceptional Causes of Valleys. \u2014 In reality, though running Avater, aided by rain and glaciers, has been the prime agent at Avork in holloAving out valleys, it Avould be en tirely beside the truth to insist that some of the other causes mentioned have not had some part in the business. We knoAv, for example, that valleys may be formed by the depression of the surface by earthquakes ; and it is perfectly certain that many of the IioIIoavs in the great lava-fields of Iceland and Etna have no connection with rivers or Avith erosion of any sort. They Avere formed by the sub sidence of the lava streams. Again, there are many round valleys, like the \" Parks\" and \" Holes \" of Western America (p. 40), which seem to be the dried-up beds of ancient lakes, and there are plenty of lakes of the present day7 (p. 323) Avhich, Avere they emptied by any subterranean movement, or by the outfloAving river deepening its OAvn channel to the level of the lake bottom, would become round valley7s, which it could not be argued were due to the erosive poAver of Avater in any direct form. Take, for example, the Lake of Liisch, situated on the Heinzenberg, at an elevation of 6,398 feet above the sea. Though fresh, it has no visible outlet, the surplus water oozing aAvay by some hidden channels. But its Avater softens the porous shale of its banks to the consistency of mud, and large masses of this material are periodically sliding doAvn to the Nolla, Avhich at flood Aoavs into the Rhine in a vast torrent of mud. The lake is therefore actually enlarging by this form of erosion; and the village of Tschappina, Avhich is in part built on a shifting foundation, is known, from some of the buildings having changed their * Ramsay : Memoirs ofthe Geological Survey, Vol. III., p. 237 ; Riitimeyer : \" Thai und Seebildung \" (1882)."], [345, "ORIGIN OF VALLEYS. 333 position, to be in danger from the lake which lies above it. Many valleys also have been the sites of old glaciers, which have been the prime instruments in their excavation, though here, again, the stream Avhich flows under the glacier and washes out the dibris which the ice has Avorn off the rock, plays an even more important part in the scooping out operations than the glacier itself. Indeed, easily attacked by the weather at the point Avhere it is fissured, the rain sweeping over the surface Avould make the first impression on it along such a crack, and thus form the gentle holloAv Avhich determined the future bed of the stream, and consequently of the valley. A valley may also, for a similar reason, take the line of a fault \u2014 not, however, because a Fig. 167. \u2014 VALLEY OF THE GREEN RIVER, A TRIBUTARY OF THE COLORADO. it quite depends on circumstances Avhether a valley of this sort will remain a valley7, or, by the nver AoAving through it filling up its deepened centre, become a lake. The tAvo are interchangeable (p. 323). Determining Origin of Valleys. \u2014 While feAV existing A7alley7s can be altogether attri buted to fissures formed in some terrestrial convulsion, it is quite certain that in many cases the cracks which penetrate the strata have had an important share in determining the course which the stream should take, and thereby fixing the line doAvn which the gathering water of the catchment basin should floAv. Joints have also had an infiuence in deciding the line Avhich the river originally adopted, since, naturally, the rock being more fault leaves a gaping fissure into Avhich the drainage Aoavs, for it is extremely rare that a dislocation of the strata leaves any opening on the surface, and even Avhen the uplifted beds rise above the level of the country, the Aveather and other denuding agents generally efiace any signs of the shifting Avhich has gone on beloAv. But there is often along the line of a fault a difierence in the mineralogical structure of the disturbed strata, so tbat erosion has a tendency to take advantage of this fact, as in the small stream AoAving south- Avard parallel to the Bala fault, from near the head of Bala Lake to Dolgelly. * Again, it Avould be contending in the face * Ricketts : Proceedings of the Liverpool Geological Society, 1872, p. 10."], [346, "334 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. of the most glaringfacts to thecontrary to affirm that the initiatory process in the formation of a valley has never been due to a fissure in the earth. Such fissures are among the most frequent concomitants of earthquakes, and when, as in tbe cases so often cited (pp. 246, 274), the country has been loAvered and the drainage disturbed, it can scarcely fail that in some instances at least, the streams Avill take the direction thus indicated for them. the Andes through soft alluvial plains to the Atlantic.

Finally, it is equally true that the folding and bending of strata have, in some cases, been instrumental in causing hill and dale. But, as Ave shall presently see, this arrange ment of the beds is favourable mainly in so far that it enables the Aveather and the streams to remoA'e the beds, or not to remoA7e them. In the one case there is a A7alley, in the other a hill is the result. plateaux, -will characterise it (Fig. 167). As for the occasional gorges in the course of a river where the current forces itself through hard rocks, these will often be found to have been caused by a Avaterfall gradually cutting its Avay back, as the Niagara and the Minnesota, at Minneapolis (pp. 308, 309), are doing. We see this recession of Avaterfalls in nearly every place Avhere they are found. In addition to the examples just quoted, the insatiable appe tite of the river is exhibited in the numerous falls of the Giessbach and at other places in Switzerland, such as at the Falls of Schaff hausen, Avhere the same action is hard at Avork. The gorge of the Rhine, between Bingen and Rolandseck, is considered to have been cut by an ancient Avaterfall, Avhich dis appeared long before the daAvn of history. But it has left behind it traces of its existence in the gorge in question, and in the little places Avhich, before the river and its tributaries Avere loAvered and the sheets of Avater in its course drained, Avere the beds of lakes like those of the Upper Columbia.* Some of these facts connected with the gradual deepening and Avidening of river valleys by erosion, as shoAvn in the annexed diagrams (Figs. 168-170), might No doubt also \u2014 indeed, the postulate is self evident \u2014 the contour of the country, Avhen it emerged from under the Avater, had a primary inAuence in determining the great Avatersheds and the course which the drainage of tbe catchment basins should take. But the secondary A-alleys, and valleys as they at present exist, are, ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the outcome of the erosive action of running Avater ; and the various shapes of the valley7, and its ditt'erent appearance in difl'erent parts of its course \u2014 upper, middle, and loAver \u2014 depend first on the force of the current in these reaches, and, secondly, on the hardness or softness of the strata through Avhich it cuts its way (Fig. 170).

Example of such a valley is afforded by Holmedale, which is scooped out of the soft Gault, Avhich lies betAveen the chalk range of the North Downs and the parallel ridge of Lower Greensand, which stretches from Guildford East close by Leith Hill. Another such valley is excav-ated in the Weald Clay, Avhich lies betAveen the LoAver Greensand and the parallel range of the Tun bridge Wells Sand, while a third valley is excavated parallel to the others betAveen the Tunbridge Wells Sand and the AshdoAvn Sand, which forms the central boss or saddle of the AVeald anticlinal fold. This series of \\-alleys is repeated Avith a repetition of the strata southward betAveen the AshdoAvn Sand and the English Channel ; so that in the little area of the Weald of Kent, Surrey7, and Sussex, there is a system of six parallel valleys which run eastward to the sea.

This Avidenino- of the banks is there fore not quite identical with the landslips Avhich go on, though, in the end, the result is much the same.

In the Alps, for example, the valle3-s which \u2014 like the great depressions along which the Rhone, Aar, Khine, and Inn run \u2014 take the line of the central axis, are described as longitudinal. On the other hand the valleys of the Reuss, Ticino, Toceia, Adda, and Adige, which run at right angles to it, are termed transverse. But as happens in the upper and lower valle3's of the Adige and other rivers, the same valley may in one part of its course be longitudinal and in another transverse, or actually become confluent or un distinguishable, so that the terms primary and secondary, also applied to them, are not strictly definable. t Seeley's edition of Phillips' \" \"Manual,\" p. 139."], [348, "336 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. the imposing Limestone and Dolomite cliffs of the \" Gesause \" betAveen Admont and HieAau, a comparatively young breach of the Enns, which at a former period had, after passing Admont, made use of the Buch auer saddle and the valley of St. Gallen to reach the north-Avestern direction at Alten markt, its present transverse valley, may be cited as another example of the same phe nomenon in valley formation. If we follow merely buried valleys, of Avhich we shall pre sently have to speak (p. 343), Avhich in no Avay correspond Avith the present ones.

This valley is indicated by the structure of the Eastern Alps, from the Pinzgau into the Pon gau, and the Wagrein district. The stream Avhich fiowed through it emptied itself into the high Enns Valley, and then ran through the Avide Rottenmann glen into the Mur district. In some of the tributary valleys the eroding action of their streams has not been able to keep pace Avith the same action in the principal one, for they open up high aboAre the latter and send their Avater doAvn as Avaterfalls into its bed. This holds true of and in another section still younger, this valley system having been formed at the expense of pre-existing ones. A good example of this is afi'orded by a Avell-knoAvn region of the Aus trian Alps (Fig. 171). Among valleys com paratively young and unfinished is that of the Salzach betAveen Taxenbach and Sclrwar zach, or, in other Avords, betAveen the Pinzgau and the Pongau.

It also sometimes happens that Ave do not find the principal rivers of a country AoAving in the broad valleys betAveen parallel ranges of hills, though it Avould be natural to expect them to do so, after the rule Avhich it has abeady been seen holds true in many other cases. On the contrary, they cut right across the ridges in narroAv gorge-like valleys, into which the tributary streams Avhich drain through the broader valleys empty. In other words, as Professor Green puts it, the principal drainage is transverse, and the tributary stream longitudinal. Such a case is afforded by the Witham, the Wetland, the Nen, and the Great Ouse. They arise in the plain to the west of the Oolite range (hard limestones) Avhich extends from Gloucestershire to Lincolnshire, and, cutting in succession across the ridge, discharge into the Wash. Again, not to For example, it is not uncommon to see a vaUey Avhich, for a certain portion of its course, is longitudinal, suddenly turn on itself at right angles and become a transverse one, running across the outcrop of the beds.

It may even be possible that in some instances the river Avhich trenches a mountain range may in the upper part of its course be older than the ridge which it cuts across, having taken its origin in dry land before the rocks of which the ridge is com posed were deposited in the sea or other sheet of water.

The only explana tion, therefore, is to suppose that when these rivers began to run the contour of the country Avas difi'erent from what it is at present, othei-Avise its course must necessarily have been deAected when it reached the ridge it iioav cuts across. At the time Avhen the rivers first began to Aow, the country through Avhich they ran Avas \"a plain as high or someAvhat higher than the top of the ridge.\" But as the river began to cut its trench across the plain, \" atmospheric denudation was at Avork wearing doAvn the country on either side, the stream carrying away the Avaste as fast as it Avas washed in.\" This explan ation, Avhich is given in the Avords of the eminent geologist just quoted, is quite in ac cordance Avith all the facts of the case, and is confirmed by other data which might be cited from many parts of the Avorld. Scotland furnishes numerous examples of mountains heAvn out of plateaux, and of valleys formed in their vicinity by the action of denudation ,* and in Ireland many rivers, like the Black- was synchronous with the elevation of the ridge. In this way Dr. Tietze accounts for the transverse valleys which cut across some of the highest spurs of the Elburz moun tains in Persia, and would go so far as to attri bute the valleys through Avhich the Indus and the Brahmapootra cross the Himalayas to a similar course of action on the part of those great rivers. This would, however, infer such a prodigiously long life for a river, and its life moreover in exactly the same course during a period when the contour of the country must have altered considerably, and many causes calculated to defiect its drainage have been at work, that one hesitates to at once accept a theory so SAveeping. Yet it must be remembered that the Karakoram and Kuenlun ranges, on the slopes of Avhich these rivers rise, are both older than the Himalayas, and therefore must have given rise to a vast drainage before the latter had appeared above the waste of waters. And here it is not irrelevant to remark that the height of any hill is no criterion of its age. The case just quoted is an ample proof of this, and the Scottish mountains, low though they are, Avere shaved by denudation long before the Alps arose, while the hills of Brazil are much older than the Andes, Avhich in their *Arch.

Where they do exist, as in the case of the Ochils, it is because the rocks of Avhich they are composed are of a more enduring character than those of adjacent strata.

SnoAvdon and Moel Hebog are, for instance, the stable remnants of synclinal folds in ancient strata, Avhile the Bristol Channel, and most likely both ends of the English Channel, lie in valleys excavated out of anticlines. But it is more than doubtful whether any of the Western Scottish lakes have been due to folding of the strata which have formed valleys and closed them by tilting, so that the outlet for their drainage Avas stopped ;* though it is possible that some of the Alpine lakes \u2014 especially those of the Italian Alps, like Maggiore and Como \u2014 might have been ancient fjords, pro jecting in the Lombardy Sea, and closed by the upheaval of the country. Many of the rivers, valleys, and lakes of the Scottish High lands trend north-east and south-Avest, or in the direction taken by the anticlines and synclines into Avhich the rocks have been folded. But several of the most marked IioIIoavs run along the anticlinal axes, or saddle backs, Avhile most of the conspicuous moun tains are built up of synclinal or saucer-shaped strata. Loch Tay is a good example of the one, Ben Lawers of the other. \" Thus,\" Avrites Professor Geikie, \" in the geological history of the Scottish Highlands Ave may trace the successive phases through Avhich many other tracts have passed. The Scandinavian plateau, and many of the mountains of Middle Germany shattered anticlines, and makes its Avay by joints, gaping cracks, and dislocations to the Ioav grounds. As time goes on, the varying character of the rocks and the mode of their arrangement begin to tell ; the Aveaker struc tures are broken up ; rockfalls and landslips ever and anon take place ; anticlinal ridges are gradually demolished ; Avhile synclines tend to endure, and thus groAV, as it Avere, into hills, by the gradual removal of the more Aveakly constructed rock masses that surround them. Valleys continue to be deepened and Avidened, Avhile the intervening mountains, eaten into by rivers and their countless feeders, and shattered and pulverised by springs and frosts, are gradually narroAved, interrupted, and reduced, until eventually, Avhat Avas formerly a great mountain chain becomes converted into a Ioav lying, undulating plain. Should the region now experience a movement of depression and sink under the sea, new sedimentary deposits Avill gather over its surface to a depth, it may be, of many hundreds, or even thousands, of feet. Should this sunken area be once more elevated en masse \u2014 pushed up bodily until it attains a height of several thousand feet \u2014 it Avill then form a plateau, composed of a series of horizontal strata resting upon the contracted and convoluted rocks of the ancient denuded mountain chain. The surface of the plateau will noAv be traversed by streams and rivers, and in course of time it must have become deeply cleft and furroAved, the ground betAveen the various valleys rising into mountain masses. Should the land remain stationary, its former fate shall again overtake it ; it will inevitably be degraded and worn down by the sub-aerial agents of erosion, until once more it assumes the character of a Ioav -lying, undulating plain.\" \u2014 such, for example, as the Harz, the Erzge birge, the Thuringerwald, etc. \u2014 show by their structure that they have undergone similar changes. First Ave have an epoch of mountain elevation, Avhen the strata are squeezed and crushed laterally, fractured, and shattered \u2014 the result being the production of a series of more or less parallel anticlines and synclines, or, in other Avords, a true mountain range.

Fjoeds. Intersecting the sea coasts of various parts of the world, more particularly in northern latitudes, are deep, narrow, more or less parallel, inlets, surrounded generally by precipitous cliff's, and varying in length from tAvo or three miles to one hundred or more, Avhich are Avidely known as \"fjords,\" \" inlets,\" \" Arths\" (though the true Arth is the continuation of an estuary), \"canals,\" (in British Columbia) and (on the western shores of Scotland) \" lochs.\" The nature of these inlets is every- Avhere identical, even though existing in Avidely differing parts of the Avorld, so that they at once suggest a common origin. In the Arst place true fjords are either confined to the western shores of continents, or are found there more frequently and in a more pronounced form than on the eastern sides. Those of Norway, Greenland, Ireland, Scot land, and America, are apt instances. Age of Valleys. \u2014 In every age ofthe Avorld's history there must have been valleys ; for at no period since the land appeared above the water has its contour been uniform, or its rainfall been free from the necessity of finding a channel for the discharge of its surplus, or the river deprived of the poAver of eroding, and therefore of deepening and widening its bed. But it does not necessarily folloAv that all of the present valleys are of great age. In the changes Avhich the surface has undergone old valleys have been filled up and neAv ones excavated. It is quite common to find old river channels buried under loads of strata. These are frequently met Avith by the Cahfornian gold digger in \" drifting \" after gold, and not uncommonly are rich in the precious metal ; t and in the coal mines of Scotland the miner often sinks into channels entirely filled Avith sand, clay, and gravel, which indicates that they have been old river beds occupied to a comparatively recent period, and subsequently hidden under loads of accumu lations dating from the Glacial Period. In the North of England we find old valleys in the mountain limestone filled up by the Trias, but again being gradually excavated by modern streams. At Gosau, in the Salzkammergut, and near Salzburg, there are old valleys in Again, they are found only Avithin certain latitudes. In Europe, for example, they do not extend south of Scandinavia, or in North America south of Vancouver Island. From the latter point the whole coast of the continent to Chiloe is an immense stretch of nearly straight line. But Avhen the point mentioned is reached, the fjord-indented shore begins again, and ap pears in New Zealand also, the west coast of the South Island being, in many respects, an exact counterpart of the shores of British Columbia. In other words, we find the tran sition from a straight to an indented coast line coincides pretty equally with that from a dry to a moist climate, and the change from the dry climate of Chili to the moist one of Western Patagonia is accompanied, as we might expect, by a depression of the suoav line on the Andes. To put these facts in another Avay, fjords are only found either Avhere glaciers have existed at some former period of the world's history (see Coloured Plate, shoAving the ancient and modern *Jas.

West coasts in high latitudes are particularly exposed to west -winds \u2014 Maury 's \" counter trades \" \u2014 which deposit on the high lands the moisture they have taken up from the sea* It is therefore to be expected that in such regions glacier action would be most marked. We are therefore justified in con cluding that these fjords Avere the valleys doAvn which glaciers crept when the coast line was higher than it is at present. The glaciers might not have actually gouged them out. They were originally valleys formed by streams draining down to the sea, or primeval hollows in the contour of the country. But the glaciers which afterwards took possession of these valleys scooped them out deeper. Indeed, at the present day glaciers are found at tbe head of many of them, in Greenland, for example, where they form the outlet for the icebergs, by which the glaciers which reach the coast relieve themselves. The western shores of this region are most markedly indented by fjords ; but the eastern side has some of a sufficiently remarkable character, that of Franz Josef, which ex tends far into the interior and has tributary valleys, being one of the most interesting examples. In Norway, however, as well as in British Columbia, and Alaska, and in New Zealand, there are not wanting instances of glaciers creeping down through the valleys at the head of the fjords, and, though they do not occupy the fjords of the West of Scotland, the glaciated sides and bottoms of these inlets are ample proofs of the purpose which they played Avhen Scotland was, like Greenland of the present day, occupied by a vast \" inland ice,\" and discharged icebergs from the seaward ends of its glaciers. Indeed, Avere the bottom of the Scottish \"lochs\" raised a little, they Avould form natural continuations of the land valleys at their head, and Sir Andrew Ramsay is inclined to attribute the fact of the Scottish lochs being in places deeper than the neigh bouring sea to the grinding power of the ice that of old fiowed down the valleys,! just as in like manner lake-basins have been gouged out by the same agent, t \u25a0f- For the literature of this subject the reader may refer to \" Arctic Papers of the Royal Geographical Society,\", pp. 58-70 ; and for the latest views to \" Med delelser om Gronland,\" Vol. I., p. 184. | Karl Pettersen considers, from observations made at Balsf jord in Norway, that this inlet \" is not of glacial origin, but formed an incision or depression in the moun tain of older origin than the Glacial age.\" I do not see sufficient grounds for accepting this generalisation, the leading facts all tending in the opposite direction.

At the same time the coast scenery, so far as indentations not produced, as in the case of fjords, by agencies proceeding from the land are concerned, is mainly due to the ceaseless dash of the waves, or to the unwonted rush of Avater during the wild storms, against which the cliffs serve as barriers. The deep bays at one place, the jagged rocks at another, the tall \" stacks \" or \" needles \" which form so prominent a feature in the scenery of some of the more Northern regions, the \" drongs \" of Shetland, the caves and arches, nowhere more noticeable than in the little island of Heligo land, and also well seen on the Devon and Cornish coast, against which the sea has been so long unrelentlessly warring, are all due to the action of the sea. they are soft, easily eroded, or permeated by joints, fissures, or faults, which permit of the water entering and gradually removing great blocks, into the place left by which the tide or waves enter and hollo av caves (Fig. 178).

Then it is that its poAver is demonstrated. At the Eddystone the engineer had to calculate that the force of the breakers during a storm was equal to 3,013 lbs. on the square foot. In the Pentland Firth the waves have been known to dash to a height of 70 feet and dislodge blocks be tween seven and ten tons in Aveight, and to heap rocks quite as heavy to the height of over sixty feet. Sir Henry De la Beche tells us that during gales masses of lime stone and granite from two to five tons in weight were washed about at Plymouth BreakAvater as if they had been pebbles. About 300 tons of such blocks were borne a distance of 300 feet, and up the inclined plane of the breakAvater. In one place a piece of limestone, seven tons in weight, Avas washed a distance of 150 feet \u2014 though it must be remembered that a rock in Avater is much lighter than on land. Again and again, during the Avinter storms, the vast blocks of concrete Avhich formed the founda tion of the Wick Bay BreakAvater Avere torn from the places Avhere they had been lowered during summer and tossed about as if they had been corks. One of these, weighing about a thousand tons, was laid at the sea- Avard end of the structure, and so secured that it Avas believed it Avould be able to resist any force Avhich could be brought against it. But no sooner did the first winter storm try conclusions Avith the breakAvater than the ponderous block Avas hurled from its place, followed in shoals by the smaller but still weighty pieces to which it formed the first line of defence. The strong iron bars, measuring about 8 inches by 3, by which the masonry Avas secured, Avere twisted into all shapes and broken, while masses of concrete weighing hundreds of tons were tossed about as if they had been small boulders. The result was, that after a vast sum had been expended in the vain endeavour to build a barrier against the sea, the effort was abandoned, and Wick Bay noAv holds in its capacious maAv the monuments of man's futile efforts to war against it. The Frisian Isles, and Holland. \u2014 During various storms the Frisian islets lying nearest the Holstein coast were formed out of the Nordstrand Peninsula, the Avaves breaking through the dykes Avhich had been con structed to keep them out, and in a few hours disrupting it into a number of Ioav sandy isles. The Sand Island Avhich lies off' Heligo land is gradually wearing aAvay. It was separated from the Rock one (Fig. 9, p. 28) last century, and traditions still remain of a time when the island stretched over to the adjoining mainland. As for Sylt and the other isles to the northAvard, they are, and have ahvays been, on the decrease, by means of the action of the waves ; * and during the storms of 1872 many of the Danish islands were overwhelmed by the Baltic. The con stant Avar Avhich the sea wages against the Dutch coast is so familiar as to scarcely require more than a passing remark. Of late years, by7 raising barriers in its Avay, Man has been the victor, and is not only content with a passive resistance to the ocean, but is actually regaining some of his old acquisitions. However, the Zuider-Zee remains as a memory of the time (600 years ago) when the sea burst into Lake Flevo. Even now it is gradually silting up : most of its once famous harbours are half useless.

The British Coast. \u2014 Along the British shores, though the contest betAveen land and Avater is not Avaged Avith such frightful results so far as life and property are concerned, the influence of the Avaves, as might naturally be expected, is very strikingly exhibited, though the destruction is not going on throughout their entire extent. The hard rocks stand out defiantly in the shape of capes, headlands, and coast-lying islets, while the softer beds arc indented by bay7s and inlets. Dingle, Kenmare, Ban try, and Dunmanus Bays are, for instance, eroded out of Shales and Limestones ; Avhile, according to Mr. BroAvne's description, the pro montories separating them are composed of beds of indurated Sandstone. On the shores of Devon and Cornwall the creeks and coves are all scooped out of the shaly slate locally knoAvn as \" Kfllas,\" Avhile the Granite and Dolerite remain as headlands and capes. Polventon Cove, at one time notorious as a smuggling station, is, for instance, formed in this Avay ; while the Merope Rocks, which afford it a shelter from the north-Avest Avinds, form a natural pier of hard Greenstone, * and on many parts of the Dorsetshire coast co\\-e alternates Avith cape, or AA-ith bold range of cliff's in exact ac cordance Avith the softer or harder character of the rocks (see Coloured Geological Map of the British Islands).

Kent furnishes many remarkable examples of the same erosive action of the sea. Sheppey Isle is rapidly- diminishing, Recul ver Church, which, in Henry VIIL's time, was nearly a mile from the sea, being iioav upon a Ioav cliff' of clay and sand. Tradition insists that the Goodwin Sands cover Earl Goodwin's lands, and the poets are never Aveary of dwelling on the legend that off the Cornish coast there existed in the days of Good King Arthur a fertile region known as Lyonnesse : \u2014 \"A land, of old upheaven from the abyss; By fire, to sink into the abyss again ; Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt.\" Antiquaries wrangle over the exact spot where C\u00e6sar landed : most likely the sea has long ago claimed the ground on which he first set foot. All along the Sussex coast we hear the same tale.

In Western Australia the sand hills are often 200 feet or 300 feet high ; on the German and Dutch coasts they are, if not so lofty, a good deal broader ; and even on the north-eastern shores of Scotland the dunes have attained considerable proportions (p. 10). They, hoAvever, act as barriers to the encroach ment of the sea, especially when they get bound together by carices, bent grass, and other plants ; and cases are not lacking in Avhich, by forming a great bar across the mouth of a river, the silt brought down by the stream accumulates until it becomes dry land. This has occurred in the Yare, Avhich must have formerly entered the sea close to Yar mouth, but, by the accumulation of sand dunes on its northern banks, its course has been altered until its present mouth is situated four miles farther south. Again, we may fittingly call attention to the fact that the ancient mouth of the Aide was originally at Aldborough ; but it noAv passes for a distance of ten miles within a bank of shingle before it empties itself into the German Ocean (p. 315). In connection with this subject it is also Avorth noticing that most of the firths along the north-eastern seaboard of Scotland \u2014 Loch Fleet, Dornoch, Cromarty, Beauly, Inverness, and Moray \u2014 are conspicuous for the sand bars at their mouth, which have been thrown up by the tide above high water-mark, and run out from either banks Sand Dunes. \u2014 Sand dunes have also an important influence in protecting the coast line from the sea Avhich formed them. These hillocks of blown sand are the sandstone rocks of the coast disintegrated into their original elements by the Avaves. For in stance, the dreary sand hills which for miles border the city of Mogador, and are found, more or less, on different parts of the coast of Morocco, are the pounded-doAvn gritty sandstone Avhich appears along that portion of the African shore. These sand dunes are markedly seen on the Dutch coast and along the \" landes \" of the shores of the Bay of Biscay7, where, until their farther progress Avas checked by the planting of pine forests, they AA-ere advancing at the rate of sixty or seventy7 feet per annum. On the northern coast of Cornwall the sands, \" ever shifting \" noAv, as Avhen Arthur fought Avith Modred by \" the phantom circle of a moaning sea,\" have in vaded large tracts of cultivated land. They iioav form considerable hills, Avhich are gradu ally being consolidated by the infiltration of And here it is Avell to remark that all bays are not necessarily the creations of the Avaves. The Bay7 of Bengal cannot scarcely have been due to erosion. More probably, like the Gulf of Mexico, it is the remnant of some greater mass of submerged land. We, hoAvever, already knoAv that all drift ing sand is not of marine origin (p. 8), much of that in Africa and Asia being due to the disintegration by the ordinary sub-aerial agencies of sandstone and sandy limestones. * The chief facts regarding the wasting of the English coast may be found in Sir Charles Lyell's \" Principles \" and Mr. Jukes-Browne's work already cited so frequently.

Rather, he is inclined to regard them as upheaved sea banks, Avhich have been moulded to their pre sent form by the action of the Avind. The land in this region has risen in recent times (p. 71).* turn suffer from the denudation just described. For as the bottom is elevated (p. 168), it will form a coast line, and then the Avaves and the tide will plane it into a more or less level slope. This has been termed a \" Plain of Marine Denudation.\" We see these slopes in most parts of the Avorld, though naturally more marked in dry than in Avet countries. For no sooner are they elevated than sub-aerial de nudation begins to act upon them, and cuts the plain into gorges and watercourses. But still the original contour can be detected. For example, they are Avell marked, and on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar \u2014 in An dalusia and Morocco. I have noticed these marine plateaux in travelling from Tangier, across the mountains to Fez, and Mr. MaAv has described Avhat appear to be uplands of the same character in various parts of Algeria, the coast of Avhich has risen at least 600 feet in times geologically recent, for at that height shells of living species are found. % Banks. \u2014 Sea \" banks,\" like the Dogger and the banks of Newfoundland, are usually the result of a meeting of currents. In the latter instance they are caused by the debris dropped by icebergs borne down from Davis Strait by the current meeting here the Gulf Stream on its way across the Atlantic. Tbe Avind, it may be added, is, when aided by sand, often an \" \u00c6olian agent \" in rough heAving the Avorld Avhich, though small, is not to be despised. For, as we often see even in Great Britain, and more notably in countries Avhere little rain falls, it acts, when driven before the Avinds, much as a \" sand-blast \" does. The rocks \u2014 as the writer has frequently noticed in California, and quite as remarkably on many parts of the British coast, at Burntis land, in Fife, for example \u2014 are polished by the friction of the flinty particles. In the Egyptian Delta, many of the ancient monu ments, the Sphinx, for instance, are not only buried by the drifting sand (Avhich protects them), but eroded by the same agency. Some times erect rocks will be \" undercut \" by the sand-laden breezes until they look like huge fungi, as do many of the upright blocks in Western America,f a land of extreme sub aerial erosion. If the beds are in an anticlinal ridge, their slope and their top Avould be sliced off and shaved across by the Avaves, while if the strata lie in a syncline the tendency will be to form a plane sloping slightly, as folloAvs from the retreat of the tide, but bounded by a more or less precipitous escarpment on the seaAvard side. On the other hand, if the land sinks, the action of the sea will have a still greater play ; for then more land Avill be brought Avithin its reach, and Avhen the elevation takes place a greater plain of marine denudation Avill be exposed ; this alternating elevation and de pression aiding in producing those series of platforms and range of inland cliff's, rising one above another, as in the Morea, each range pierced by caves and Avith an old shell beach at its base. The Isle of Wight is regarded by geologists as the remnant of a much larger land, the shores of Avhich have been eaten into by the sea, and the Yare and Sand ham branch of the Brading river as the shattered remnants of much larger streams, which flowed north Avard into the Solent before Plains of Marine Denudation.\u2014 But though the sea is practically poAverless to erode its bottom, except at a very moderate depth, every part of it Avhich becomes dry land must in its * Petermann's Geographisehe Mittheilungen, July, 1887. t Gilbert, in Report of the United States Geological Surrey West of the 100th Meridian, Vol. III., p. 82.

If the coast Avere raised sixty feet the Isle of Wight Avould be united Avith the neigh bouring coast of Hampshire.

For long distances round the shores the sea is not over 600 feet deep, Avhile outside this comparatively shalloAV limit the the land sinks, then the sea gets a fresh s'ur- face to act upon, Avhile it sweeps into the depth beyond the sandy slope formed by its previous efforts. In like manner, Avhen the land rises, it can begin again with a fresh \" purchase \" on the old shore, though in this case it filches nothing from the land, but by removing the shingle, which acted as a protection to the cliffs beyond, it paves the Avay for an onslaught against them at a future period. In brief, Avhile sub-aerial denudation works vertically cutting doAvn, marine denudation acts hori zontally, cutting inAvards in conjunction Avith the secular rise or fall of the coast-line. Sea Deposits. \u2014 The combined influence of the forces described, acting now as in the past, are resulting in the formation of a certain amount of marine deposits. Along the Euro pean shores Edward Forbes recognised three zones, the littoral, Avhich just marks the limit of the tide ; the laminarian, which extends from seven to fifteen fathoms, marked by the presence of the great tangles which are seen floating beyond the limits of low water ; and, still deeper, in the Mediterranean, a coralline zone, extending from 50 to 100 fathoms. These zones are, however, mainly distinguished by the shore vegetation. Fig. 182. \u2014 MICROSCOPIC SECTION OP THE CHALK OF MEUDON (MAGNIFIED 300 TIMES).

On the whole, however, taking all the facts of the case into consideration, the sea does not erode the land to anything bke the same extent which the subaerial agents do. Its power is limited, unless the coast is either rising or sinking, for, as the rise of the tide is limited, and the action of the sea is only poAverful Avhen the waves beat against the cliffs, a time must come when they will have to expend their force on a sloping sandy or shingly beach.

This is the reason why, after a thaAv, some rocks appear almost as if pulverised, Avhile others are forced out of the ground as if some internal move ment had burst the soil. Hence in Alpine countries a concomitant of winter is usually the tumbling down of great masses of rock ; Avhile in the Arctic regions no sound is more familiar during the long, lonely, silent night than the loud reports caused by cliff's being torn asunder by the Avater expanding in the crevices, cavities, or other fissures in their mass. Indeed, the waste Avhich rain causes farther south, is in the north paralleled by this continual action of the frost during some eight or nine months in the year, though the principal destruction takes place during the first few days of every winter. When its temperature fall:: to 32\u00b0, fresh water, under ordinary conditions, solidifies into the form of ice. In freezing it expands, so that, as Ave see familiarly in the case of Avater-pipes, it Avill burst any vessel which it filled Avhen in the bquid condition. If under pressure, water takes a greater amount of cold to solidify, though the moment the pressure is removed, it will congeal, expanding, of course, in the process. This it does with prodigious power. If, for example, it does not freeze until the tem perature falls two degrees beloAv the ordinary freezing-point, the force exerted on the cavity in Avhich it is confined has been calculated to amount to 138 tons on the square inch, and so on in proportion. Hence it need not be a cause for surprise that a bombshell filled Avith Avater and hermetically sealed bursts when subjected to cold sufficiently great. Disruption by Frost. \u2014 Water, when it lodges in fissures, can usually expand in freezing without doing very much damage, freezing generally occurring at 32\u00b0. But Avhen it is contained in cavities in rocks, the con ditions necessary for this enormous pressure, namely, congelation below the ordinary freez ing-point, are sometimes attained with the Fresh- water Ice.\u2014 The rivers in high lati tudes or in the interior of northern conti nents also freeze over during winter, and Avhen the ice breaks up during spring, the great sheets roaring and rushing seaAvard abrade the banks, and carry far from their original site the earth, rocks, and other waste which has fallen on them from the crumbling cliff's"], [367, "FRESH-WATER AND SEA ICE. 355 disrupted by the frost or eroded by the freshets of those sudden thaws, which are not uncom mon in Northern America, Europe, and Asia. Sometimes in narroAv channels the disrupted sheets of ice join and form a \" raft \" which for a time dams back the stream, and Avhen the barrier gives Avay, bursts with tremendous force, carrying all before it. In this way, by the force of the rush of Avater bearing the pile of ice against the shore, earthen banks have been undermined and Ioav islands in time worn away. In the St. Lawrence, for example, Crab Island, which at the beginning of tbis century was an acre and a half in extent, is now only marked by shalloAV Avater over the spot Avhere it existed. In the Siberian rivers, which Aoav from south to north, the ice in their upper portion is thaAved, while that in the lower reaches still remains firm from bank to bank.* Hence by the floating ice piling itself aboAre the fixed, great dams are formed, causing much damage, and in some respects resembling the lakes accumulated by a glacier sliding athwart a stream, as has happened more than once, in the Himalayas, for ex ample (p. 297), and in Switzerland, where, in 1818, a tunnel had to be cut through one which extended across the Dranse Valley in order to permit the accumulated waters of the stream to drain aAvay.f by some observers \u2014 Sterry Hunt, Bell, and Arago \u2014 considered to be due to terrestrial radiation. But this does not explain all the phenomena, and the idea of Zschokke that the anchor ice is formed on the surface and carried to the bottom by the current, seems to agree better Avith the facts (Weber and Rae), since it is doubtful whether water is so penetrable for dark rays that the radiation can haA7e any effect on the formation of the \"fraziL\" In the Baltic harbours, where the water is only brackish, large stones, ropes, chains, and even anchors, are knoAvn to have been raised to the surface by the large masses of ground ice formed around them. In ponds which freeze to the bottom boulders are incorporated in the ice. As the ice is evaporating at its surface, Avhde accessions of Avater lift the ice, the boulders are raised, and gradually carried towards the periphery. On large lakes the drifting ice is pressed against the shores, and thus forms dykes of boulders. \u00a7 Sea Ice. Much more important, however, than the ice formed in rivers and lakes, is that Avhich covers the surface of the sea in very high northern latitudes during the coldest months in the year. The temperature at Avhich salt Avater freezes varies from 26\u00b0-7|| to as high as 31\u00b0, the degree depending entirely upon the saltness of the water. This relative amount of salt, Ave know from numerous observa tions, varies considerably in different parts of the ocean, and in the Arctic region depends upon the amount of fresh Avater Avhich may be pouring into any of the numerous land-locked Anchor Ice. \u2014 When a stream is shallow, ice will adhere to the bottom ; but even in deep rivers and lakes, when the bottom is rocky or stony, if the water is shallow compared with what it is higher up the stream, or the current is swifter and the water rougher compared with what it is immediately above, \" anchor \" or \"ground ice\" forms on the bottom and rises to the surfaces carrying Avith it in some cases gravel, sand, and other materials. This -will happen Avhen the surface of the water is quite unfrozen. As a rule, hoAvever, it is spongy, slushy kind of ice, arranged in vertical flakes.

The first thin ice formed is really fresh : it is often nothing more than the melted siioav of the surface. The effect of the cold seems to be to precipitate the salt, since, except for the brine included among the crys tals, the ice itself is frequently little more than brackish, this brackishness being mainly due, first, to the cause mentioned, and, secondly, to Fig. 185. \u2014 ICEBERG, AND PART OF A POLAR ICE FIELD. the infiltration of salt Avater from the sea below by means of capillary attraction.* The ice thus formed is of an azure blue colour, and of great density. Compared with the sea Avater of Avhich it is composed, it is as 0922 to 1000, and in floating one part is above the water bne and fourteen and eight-tenths beloAv it. By and-by, as the winter advances, the sea, as at or the Avind, have forced it into \" torroses,\" to use the Russian word, or \" hummocks,\" as the Scottish whalers call them, so that the \" pack ice \" is often as if the ruins of a toAvn had been tumbled on the surface of an ice sheet, and then covered with a coating of snow (Fig. 200). Polynia. \u2014 It is, hoAvever, rare to find the ice quite continuous during winter. \" Polynia,\" or open spaces, are quite common, and out of them the ice smoke, or the evaporation in the shape of little spicul\u00e6 of ice, often rises during the Avinter, while herds of Avhite whales and other cetaceans crowd the narroAv area of these breathing-holes. In Hudson Bay and other places there are long fissures in the ice which remain open throughout the winter. * In this place I have given only such particulars as are necessary for the understanding of what follows. In \"The Countries of the World,\" Vol. I, pp. 18-71, will be found many details which it has not been thought expe dient to go over again. So far as sea ice is concerned, the reader may be referred to Weyprecht's \" Die Metamor phosen des Polareises \" (1879), which, in spite of much to which exception might be taken, is the only full treatise on the subject."], [369, "357 SEA ICE FIELDS. <i Temperature, Dr. Bell thinks, has no influence upon their breadth. They form every Avinter in the same situations, and generally between the extremity of points on opposite sides of the water. He considers it probable that the progressive lowering of the water going on during the winter produces a tension on such places sufficient to keep the fissures snoAvs of years. The neve-hke stratification, the embedded atmospheric dust, and the chemical character of these polar floes indicate that they are the accumulated snoAvfall of ages rendered brackish by infiltration and efflorescence. This was the opinion of the late Dr. Moss \u2014 an opinion to which General Greely gives the force of his acquiescence. If Polar floes, from a hundred to a thousand feet in thickness, are formed by direct freezing, as Nares imagined, the Polar lakes, Avhich are subjected to greater cold than the sea, Avould be frozen to the bottom. This, hoAvever, is not the case. In Lake Hazen, for example, Greely noticed that the main ice was moA7able by the wind, as shoAvn by the fact of the ex tensive ridges of small stones formed by its pressure on the shores open. Thickness. \u2014 The thickness of an ice field depends, of course, mainly on the temperature, though, as the \" Pal\u00e6ocrystic ice \" proves, the amount of siioav and other circumstances enter largely into the causes to which it is due. About eight feet is, hoAvever, the average thick ness Avhich a sheet of sea ice will attain in the \u25a0course of Avinter if it is not disturbed, though in Smith's Sound, Hayes will have it that an ice table bas been formed by \" direct freezing \" to the depth of 18 feet.* But though the thickness Avhich ice attains in free formation is comparatively small, fields of ice are met Avith 30, 40, 100, and even 1,000 feet thick. But these are the result of the forcing of ice sheets over one another by pressure, and are known as old ice, which differs from young ice by its greater density. Or it is formed after the manner of the \" Pal\u00e6ocrystic \" ice. Tbis term, though devised to express an altogether mistaken theory, which has since been abandoned by its author, may still be con veniently used to describe the vast thickness of old-packed ice Avhich is found in the upper reaches of Smith's Sound. But these fields are not eternal or immovable, and the Pal\u00e6ocrystic Sea differs in no respect from many other portions of tbe Arctic ocean, except that it is of greater area and covered Avith a greater extent of old ice, Avhich seldom breaks up, and is therefore not melted every summer, or, indeed, except when it drives south \u2014 Avhich it has a difficulty in doing through the narroAv gut of Smith's Sound\u2014 neA-er melts in its entirety. In brief, the Pal\u00e6ocrystic ice is formed as any other ice field is. But the great thickness of the ice is due to the accumulated The terms \" patch,\" \" floe,\" \" field,\" and so forth, are used to express the relative magni tudes of the ice, though the Avord \" floe \" is very generally applied to every kind of sea ice Avith out reference to its size.

Indeed, the hummocks Avhich relieve the continuity of its original flat surface, and give it the appearance of a rugged country, are the result of the unrest, which is the characteristic ofa sea coursed over by currents and disturbed by Avinds, tides, or by the SAvell which reaches it from the ocean. The effect of this is seen in the broken ice on either side of a \" lead,\" this rubble being caused by tbe crushing of the edges of tAvo floes against one another. As spring and summer advance the great fields part, until black road -like \"leads \" of open Avater shoAv themselves throughout their extent.

This is knoAvn as the \" ice foot.\" In high latitudes or in places where the tide has little influence, this ice foot may be considered as the remains of the land floe. But Avhen the tide rises and falls Avith some force it admits of another explanation. As Dr. Boas puts it \u2014 and his experience Avas entirely of the most southern part of Davis Strait \u2014 it reaches from high-water to low-Avater mark, gradually decreasing in thickness, and having a vertical edge. The process of its formation \" begins before the sea is frozen over, and as the Avater is still agitated by Avinds the thickness of the layer formed during a single tide is consider able. This process is going on during the winter, and then the ice foot continues to in crease in Avidth. At spring tide its level is. overfloAvn by Avater, Avhich adds to its height. It is characteristic of this ice foot that the unbroken land floe extends to its foot, a single crack separating the two masses.\" incase his vessel before the floes move tOAvards each other, is caught betAveen tbe treacherous portions of the disrupting ice, and is crushed as if his vessel had been a toy boat. All summer the Arctic sea is cumbered with these floating fragments of tbe Avinter's ice, the pieces being of all sizes, Avhile outside the larger sheets is an oozy, broken-up mass, gene rally knoAvn as \" brash ice.\" These broken or breaking up fields are \"rotten.\" The snoAV that had fallen during the winter is melting, and the heat of the summer rapidly evaporates the surface of the ice, Avhile the dash of the liberated sea against their edges sounds Avith a peculiar crackling noise as the Avater penetrates the increasingly oozy mass. The colour of the ice is by this time of a delicate azure blue, Avith yelloAvish spots, due to the presence of innumerable diatoms, which also appear in broAvn slimy masses from the under surface of the floes Avhen the iron-shod proAV of the vessel crashes through their decayed mass.* After a very cold night or a sudden fall of temperature it is noticed that the ice fields break up much more rapidly. This is no doubt due to the expansion of the re-frozen thaAved water in their interstices, or of the sea Avater, Avhich in spring is permitted to Avork its Avay in through the opening pores betAveen the crystals, as Avell as to the sudden contraction and splitting due to a very similar cause. At this season the northern navigators are able to detect the presence of great unbroken ice fields from a long distance, by the \" ice blink \"f or light reflected from the snoAV just under the stratum of air in Avhich the phenomenon is seen. In like manner the \" loom \" of open places is shoAvn by the \" Avater sky \" or the dark spots on the horizon produced by the formation of clouds from the ascending mist due to evaporation. Geological Influence of Sea Ics. \u2014 During Avinter and spring, loads of earth and rock tumble from the cliff's overhead, and either lie on or become embedded in the ice foot. Then Avhen the ice gets free, this mass is either deposited in the sea, or is carried on the ice raft to a distance, or is driven against the shore by the force of the tide, currents, and Avind, grinding the softer rocks Avith Avhich it comes in contact, or undermining the high shores. against Avhich ft is driven. In the Baltic, ice fields are sometimes stranded high and dry on the shore, with their load oi debris, and Keyser ling tells us of a granite block being landed 30 feet above the ordinary sea level by the ice sheet in Avhich it Avas lying being forced to that height by the Avind and Avaves. In the shalloAV Avaters of the Baltic the rocks are often scratched and ground by these ice sheets Avith their embedded stones, in much the same Avay as the moving mass of glacier ice scratches and grinds rocks.

It also varies according to the exposure of a mountain range. It will even be at different levels on the tAvo sides of the same peak. For instance, in the Hohentauern, in the Eastern Alps, the snoAV-line is at 9,000 feet on the north side and at 9,350 on the south side, and ascends still higher on those parts of the as it is knoAvn among the Germans.

For example, to cite Forbes's classical observations, the mean daily rate of the Mer de Glace is, in summer and autumn, from twenty to twenty-seven inches in the centre, and from thirteen to nineteen and a half inches near the sides, so that a lump of rock which fell on its upper part in the year when \\Yilliam of Orange landed at Torbay, would only now be in the Valley of Chamonix. It has, how ever, been noticed that in the Arctic regions \u2014 in Greenland for example \u2014 the discharge of ice from the interior ice-fields is much more rapid. Take Jakobshavn ice fjord in lat. 69\u00b0 13' N. as an instance. Here the vast inland ice (Fig. 190) is constantly relieving itself in the shape of icebergs, some of which are close on 400 feet high, and occasionally even higher. The breadth of the fjord, or rather of the glacier occupying it, is about 14,760 feet, and the dip of the glacier is less than half a degree. Its central part, at a distance of 3,280 feet from the sides, advanced during the summer when it was studied by Helland at the rate of 65J feet per diem, while at the distance of between 1,312 and 1,476 feet its velocity was reduced to 49 feet per day. Finally, close to the sides, the mass moved at no greater speed than a little over half a foot a day. The \" inland \" ice which projects into the southern branches of the Jakobshavn Fjord, fifteen miles from the main glacier, moves at a speed not exceed ing a foot and a third, or a foot and a half, a day.* Bay. The water is deep up to the very edge of the ice, which Mr. Seton-Karr de scribes as rising like a broken wall, from which a shower of icebergs of various size is constantly falling into the ocean which laves its foot and undermines its green and glassy features. Glacier Bay is thirty miles long and eight to ten miles wide. At its mouth is a cluster of thirty islands named Beardslee, composed of glacial de'brw. The width of the ice where the glacier breaks through the mountains is 10,644 feet, and of the water front one \u25a0 mile, being in places as much as 400 feet high. Nine large and seventeen smaller branches unite to form the main ice stream, Avhich to the extent of a current 5,000 feet Avide and 700 feet deep, enters the sea during the month of August at the rate of seventy feet a day in the centre, and ten feet in the margin, t On the other hand, many glaciers do not advance more than 10, 12, or a few inches a day (those of the Aar progress no faster than 55 feet in a year), the speed of an ice river being, to a large extent, dependent on the angle of its slope and the mass of material which is pressing from behind, the enormous speed of the glaciers of Alaska and Greenland being due to the latter fact, though the former is not without its influence on them. If the slope is only about 3\u00b0, then the motion of the glacier must be quick, above 8\u00b0 or 9\u00b0 the motion is hardly that of an ordinary glacier, while if the gradient is as high as 25\u00b0 or 30\u00b0 the Aoav is simply, as an eminent authority has said, \" a mere silent cataract of fragments.\" The cause of the motion has been the subject of many works, and is still the theme of much hot discussion among the adherents of the rival theories put forward.

This is the \" Gravitation theory.\" Charpentier and, aftei-Avards, Agassiz, looked to the alternate freezing and melting of the rain and siioav that enter the fissures, as the motive poAver Avhich propels the glacier forward. This is the \" Dilatation theory.\" Lastly, not to mention several other vieAvs, Forbes re garded a glacier as a sluggish ice stream, Avhich, though brittle, just as Avax is brittle, bas the poAver of accommodating itself to the irregularity of the bed along Avhich it Aoavs, this plasticity being of much the same charac ter as that Avhich enables a stick of sealing- Avax to bend if laid across a beam until it is in a curve, though not broken. His doctrine has been termed the \" Viscous \" or \" Plastic theory.\" as an apparently unbroken mass* Even when the upper portion of the glacier tumbles over an escarpment in a cascade of detached blocks, forming a regular ice cascade of an irregular kind, the stream heals its scars, and rolls on in as solid a mass as before, t Crevasses. \u2014 In floAving through a v7alley the glacier is subjected to stress, Avhich causes it to fracture and form fissures, AA-hich often gape for great distances, and Avhen covered over with a slender bridge of snoAV consti tute in spring-time one of the chief dangers attending glacier travelling. These \"cre \\7asses\":|: are usually transA7erse (Fig. 192) to the direction of the floAv Avhen the glacier passes over an inequality in its bed. But they may take other courses, the course of Avhich depends on the nature of the obstruc tion, the change of slope, &c. Marginal crevasses may also result from the friction of the ice stream against its banks. These fissures hoAveA'er, OAving to this fact, and the consequent more rapid flow of the central position, will usually leav-e the side at a moderate angle and tend to run up stream. CreA-asses are, hoAvever, no sooner formed than, by the motion of the glacier and the action of regelation, they begin to close, and To a certain extent there is some truth in all of these theories, though none of them are exclusively true. Without entering into this vexed question, Avhich is still far from settled, Ave may state briefly the vieAv most generally espoused. Glacier ice, it is knoAvn, is plastic under pressure, such as that Avhich enables the snoAV of the neve \u2014 or end of tbe glacier above the snow- line \u2014 to be squeezed into ice, but it is not plastic under tension, it will not bear draAving out into filaments like wax, borax, or bitumen. But if two fragments of ice are put together they Avill Fig. 102. \u2014 CREVASSES IN GLACIERS. a, Transverse crevasses ; b, longitudinal crevasses. immediately freeze into one, even though brought into contact in water as hot as the hand can bear. \" Plasticity \" and \" regelation \" are thus the factors in glacier motion. The ice moves doAvn a slope partly impelled by the masses in the rear. But the continuity of the stream is maintained by the broken fragments immediately freezing together AA'hen they are pushed against each other. So much is this the case, that Avhen a glacier is squeezed into a narroAv gorge and is compelled to take a leap over a precipice, the broken ends re-unite in the valley below, and continue their course other rifts to form in the mass as it passes OA-er tbe same or similar obstructions, the noise caused by the tearing asunder of the great ice river echoing like thunder claps far and Avide among the lonely Alpine valleys.

Or those materials loosened by the winter's frost, the spring thaws, or the summer rain, tumble doAvn on the glacier beneath, and are carried on with it. In this way the sides of glaciers are littered Avith a more or less continuous line of such debris, Avhich are known as the lateral (or side) moraines* But when tAvo glaciers from different valleys meet and coalesce, then (Fig. 193) the con- some rude rampart atliAvart the valley, at the point reached by the vanished ice river on the surface of which they Avere carried. In addition to these moraines (Fig. 194) there is also a considerable quantity of earth, sand, and even stones, carried along by the under surface of the glacier.

The Waste of Glaciers. \u2014 This is continually going on, not only at the end Avhere the pro gress of tbe ice riv-er is arrested by the heat of the loAvlands into Avhich it has protruded, but on the surface also. During the height of summer, streams of Avater from the melting ice and snoAV are continually coursing over its surface, forming on the great glaciers of the north little lakes, and on the smaller ones of the south, cascades, by falling Avith a sullen roar into the crevasses Avhich run atliAvart their course. Sometimes they fill up the fissures, and thus form Avhat are called baignoirs, or baths. But in many instances they penetrate through the Avhole thickness of the glacier, and appear at the loAver end of it in the shape of that milky stream which escapes from under the ice, and forms the head Avaters of so many rivers, the Rhone and Ganges (Fig. 177) among the number. In this case, from its likeness to the stream of Avater Avhich drives a miU-Avheel,. the water tumbling doAvn a crevasse is called &moulin.\\\\ A glacier, accordingly, OAving to the waste which goes on, decreases in thick ness every year, so that its loAver portion is thinner than its upper \u2014 in other Avords, it is Avedge - shaped, this thaAving off being in creased by the fact that the loAver doAvn a glacier reaches the greater must be its waste,. since the heat increases every yard it advances.

There is also a certain waste going on at greater depths : the soil wears away the ice by friction, and the streams which course under it being warmer than the ice, also help in the work of ablation. Finally, the springs, often much higher in temperature than the surface water, aid in the work of what Forbes called \" glacier subsi dence.\" In most parts of Switzerland, during the height of summer, the daily average abla tion is 362 inches ; the daily subsidence 163 inch. But during winter, whilst the glacier is covered with snow, the subsidence is sus pended, and some portion of the summer waste is recouped. At this season the baignoirs and moulins are closed, and the whole mass of ice becomes more consolidated, so that ablation is reduced to a minimum. These facts, thus stated in their barest outline, explain several features seen on the surface of glaciers to which Ave have not yet referred. These are ice tables and gravel cones. protecting the ice, by getting heated, forms a hole into which it sinks. The share Avhich moulins have in making \" pot-holes \" has already been noticed (Fig. 160), and those in the glacier gardens of Lucerne have been described (p. 311). Gravel Cones. \u2014 Though these features are by no means so common as glacier tables, they may be seen in many places, particularly on the Aar Glaciers, where their character has been carefully studied. Externally they appear bke mounds of earth and gravel, but internally they are composed of ordinary glacier ice. Their origin is not far to seek. When the glacial streams begin to course over the surface, they carry Avith them a good deal of the detritus washed out ofthe moraines, and deposit it either in the inequalities of the ice or at the bottom of the crevasses into which they tumble. By-and-by, owing to the superficial waste of the glacier, these heaps are exposed, on account of the general surface of the ice being depressed to their level. The cone is due to exactly the same cause as that which forms the pillar of the glacier table. The earth on the outside of the ice protects it from melting, and from the waste which would ensue were it exposed to the dash of the summer rains. Cones are also sometimes due, as glacier tables are, to a mass of moraine falling bodily into a crevasse, or some times even to rocks which have got embedded Glacier Tables. \u2014 There are often seen lying on the surface of a glacier slabs of stone sup ported by pillars of ice. These \"glacier tables\" (Figs. 189, 195)* are due simply to the protection which the stone affords against the heat of the sun. The ice on every side melts away, but that portion Fig. 195. \u2014 GLACIER TABLE. under the slab remains until it forms a pillar, capped by the stone, just as we have seen that earth pillars are produced in a similar manner by the capping stones protecting the pillar from the erosive action of rain (Figs. 138, 139). These ice pillars vary from a few inches to a height of 12 feet when the capping stone is very broad. Tiny tables may even be produced by leaves and other materials accumulating in sufficient quantity, though these are usually blo-wn or Avashed away, so that a fallen leaf, a dead insect, or a little stone, so far from Fig. 196. \u2014 DIRT BANDS OP GLACIER, SHOWING THEIR SUPERFICIAL FORM AND THE COURSE OF THE STRUC- TURAL LAMIN\u00c6. in the under surface of the glacier ; though on this subject, as well as on the means by which they are forced to the surface, there is * German, Glettchertisch. 24"], [382, "370 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY. considerable difference of opinion. In this way also knapsacks, hammers, and other objects Avhich have fallen into crevasses have, after the lapse of a number of years, been disgorged.

This laminated, ribboned, or banded structure, produced by the alternation of thin plates or strata of ice different in colour from that of Structure of Glacier Ice. \u2014 The ice of a Fig. 19 PIERRE DES JIARMETTES,\" AN ERRATIC GRANITE BLOCK OR \" FOUNDLING \" AT MONTHEY IN THE LOWER VALAIS. glacier proper differs considerably in struc ture from tbe stratification of the neve in which it originated. Examined in the wall of a crevasse, it is seen to be streaked Avith beautiful vertical veins, like the \"cipollino\" marble of Italy, the lamin\u00e6 varying in hue from bluish-green through green to Avhite. They are usually parallel to the sides of the glacier, though rather inclining from the shore to the centre of the ice stream. On the sur face of the glacier\u2014 at intervals of some hundreds of feet\u2014 there are superficial dis colourations in the form of excessively elon gated hyperbolas. These are due, according to the observations of Forbes, to portions of the ice in which the veined structure is the rest of the glacier \u2014 Avhich is whiter, owing to its being more porous \u2014 is due, as Tyndah's experiments proved, to pressure. It may therefore be regarded as analogous to slaty cleavage (p. 112). Erosive Power of Glaciers. \u2014 The power of glaciers to grind, like their poAver to bore or gouge, has been the theme of not a little hot discussion. Some observers will have it that though they scrape and polish to a great extent, they do not dig deeply. \" They are,\" accord ing to Mr. Freshfield, \"not so much the sculptor's workman as the sculptor himself. Their share in hill structure is to give it artistic merit : to round a corner and polish a boss.\" In proof of this, the fact is adduced that"], [383, "371 GLACIERS: THEIR RETREAT AND ADVANCE. in Alaska, Muir's Glacier passes over a forest buried in sand Avithout having disturbed it. In this instance, however, the ice had been partially supported by a spur of rock, and therefore its whole Aveight had not pressed on the sand* though cases might be cited which could not be explained aAvay by a fact like the one mentioned. On the other hand, Avhen ever a glacier has passed for any length of time, we find the rocks Avorn and grooved ; and when bosses of hard rock have lain in their way, these roches moutonnees,t or sheep like rocks, peep above the pastures in Avhich they noAv lie as monuments of a former age. in the under surface of the glacier, tbe amount of erosion Avhich it accomplishes must be in finitely greater.

When the ice stream has been obstructed by an outlying crag, like that on which Edin burgh Castle stands, it grinds in front of the cliff, and then sweeps behind it the debris it has worn out ; just as a stream which finds a boulder in its course washes out everything in front of the obstacle, and sends a tail of sand and gravel from the other side where there is quiet water.

For instance, the glacier of La Brenva, on the south side of Mont Blanc, continued to shrink from 1818 to 1878, and in the interval from 1854 to 1865 the Glacier des Bossons, also in Mont Blanc, retreated 1,089 feet, and that of Four 1,706 feet. Since 1855 the glaciers of the Pyrenees and the Caucasus have also been observed to shrink. But a shrinkage is generally folloAved after a time betAveen 1871-75 in all the chains of the Alps there Avas not a single known glacier Avhich had not decreased in size. Nearly all of . these have, hoAvever, again begun to advance. But the glaciers of the Rhine and the Aar are still at the stage of shrinkage, and so are most of the glaciers of Glarus and the Grisons, as well as those of the Austrian Alps.* This advance is due to a greater Fig. 199.\u2014 NEWLT-FORMED \" FLOEBERGS \" IN ROBESON'S CHANNEL DURING THE WINTER OP 1875-76. (After Nares.) by an advance. The Pasterzen glacier, which was yearly on the retreat, began, in 1883, to slightly advance, and a similar forward move ment is said to be observable in those of Mont Blanc. For example, the loAver extremity of the Glacier des Bossons is steadily keeping tOAvards loAver and lower levels, its inferior extremity having for the past three years ad vanced at the rate of over 160 feet a year. A grotto cut out of the ice in May, 1866, a quarter of a mile from its termination, has moved doAvn more than 180 feet. The loAver Grindehvald glacier is the lowest in the Alps. Until recently it terminated at 3,409 feet above the sea. But after a period of re treat it has again begun to advance. Indeed, amount of snoAvfall in its upper regions ; its retreat to the opposite cause, combined with an increase of temperature in the region into which it advances. In the Alps the glaciers keep more than 3,000 feet above the sea ; in the Arctic regions they reach the sea \u2014 as, indeed, they do in one place in Norway, and in several places in Alaska. But at some former period in the world's history, which we shall have occasion to speak of at a later stage in our studies, glaciers existed where none are now found, their existence being traced by the grooved and polished rocks, the old moraines and * Forel : \" Les Variations Periodiques des Glaciers des Alpes\" (1885)."], [385, "373 GLACIERS: THEIR RETREAT AND ADVANCE. the erratic rocks \u2014 Avhat the SavIss call \" foundlings\" \u2014the remains of ancient mo- vanished glaciers ground, or, as in Scotland and other parts of the world, dropped by Fig. 200.\u2014 CAPE FLIGELY (PAYEE'S MOST NOETHEELY POINT IN PSANZ JOSEF'S LAND.) raines which have been left perched on the sides of the valleys through which the icebergs Avhich had floated o\\7er the surface, at that time under the sea (Figs. 197, 198, and"], [386, "374 OUR EARTH AND ITS STORY.

Polar Glaciers.\u2014 These in their geological relations may, perhaps, be better studied when the Glacial Period is under consideration, since during that age of the Avorld's history, the regions subjected to it Avere, in many re spects, the counterpart of those from Avhich in the Polar regions icebergs take their origin. In every other respect the Polar glacier is tbe same as the Southern one, only that Avhile the latter rarely reaches the sea the other invariably does, and relieves itself not by melting, but by breaking off in the shape of an iceberg (Fig. 185). These icebergs are the seaAvard ends of glaciers, Avhich are the overpourings of a vast inland expanse of ice (Fig. 190). This ice, so far as Ave knoAv, covers the entire interior of Greenland, and is seen in caps over other Arctic islands. On the Avhole face of the earth there is perhaps no drearier region than this inland ice of Greenland. EastAvard the vision is bounded by a misty horizon terminating in ice and unobstructed by any sight or sound, Avhich reminds one of the land which is fading behind the explorer as the land fades behind the v7oyager who sets sail on the ocean. North and south the same dismal landscape meets the eye. Here and there in holes in the ice a few specks may be detected. These are found to consist of kryokonite (p. 68) \u2014 a minute mineral, Avhose origin it is hard to trace, \u2014 of a feAV specks of meteoric dust, and some exceed ingly minute beaded plants of the Conferva order, such as not unfrequently occur on snoAV-. But there is no trace of moraine, Avhich, one Avould imagine, Avould be found if the ice in its course across the country had ever come in contact with mountains or exposed land. In many respects the inland ice is the most remarkable feature of the Arctic regions. In South Greenland it does not approach within a hundred miles or thereabouts of the coast ; but in North Greenland its borders can fre quently be seen from the sea. But Avherever found its general features are the same. In South Greenland there are one or two \" Nunataks \" (Fig. 190), or islet-peaks, pro jecting above the surface of the ice. These are evidently remnants of the old land surface, Avhich have not as yet been overwhelmed by the garnered snoAvs of unnumbered ages. But Avherever the country has been penetrated else where, after the ice-free stripe of land along the coast has been passed, nothing except one vast expanse of glacier ice has been seen. In early summer this is of course covered with snoAV. But as the long Arctic day advances, the surface is coursed by streams of water, which in the hollows of the ice form lakes often of considerable extent, or thunder with a sullen roar through the vast crevasses which intersect it in every direction, though as the We are therefore led to the conclusion that the inland ice of Greenland is due to the immense accumulations of snoAV during fully three-fourths of the year not being melted during the brief summer (during Avhich, on the coast at least, little or none falls), Avithout the intervention of a mountain range, as in the case of more southern glaciers. In brief, the snow acts like the grain emptied out on the floor of a bam : the surplus slides in the shape of glacier ice to the east coast on one side, and the Avest coast on the other, from the elevated plateau of the far interior. At one time, perhaps, a range did exist, as, no doubt, hill and valley did ; but long ago they have been overAvhelmed, as there is every reason for believing Scotland, among other countries, Avas during the last Glacial Period. As Ave advance from the coast to the in terior the elevation gradually increases. Hoav high the plateau is Ave cannot say, for, though Greenland is fully 1,400 miles long and 900 broad at its widest, no one has as yet penetrated more than 130 miles from the coast on the west side, Avhere the ice is nearer the sea than on the east.

Several attempts have been made to investigate this Arctic mystery \u2014 in one of which the writer shared* \u2014 but those expeditions which were fortunate to reach farthest are to be credited to Baron Nordenskjold and bis companions. The first of these was in 1870, when, after a journey of almost thirty miles, they reached a point in lat. 68\u00b0 22' N., about 2,200 feet above the sea. In 1883 he succeeded in reaching a spot eighty miles from the edge of the ice,-f and his Laps pushed on until they stopped at a point computed \u2014 too liberally, I believe \u2014 to he 130 miles from the sea. The ice was then 6,000 feet high, and still rose gradually to the east, but no peaks were visible. The con tinent has thus been crossed for so consider able a distance, that, if there Avere any peaks of much magnitude \u2014 such as Payer's and Petermann's Peaks on the east coast \u2014 they could hardly fail to have been visible. But \" the inland ice,\" writes this famous explorer, \" continued to rise towards the interior, so that the horizon to the east, north, and south, was terminated by an ice border almost as smooth as that of the ocean.\" This inland ice is of unknoAvn thickness ; but, from ob servations niade at places where it reaches the coast,J it has been estimated to be fre quently from 1,000 feet to 3,000 feet deep. There is, therefore, in Greenland no neve in the sense Ave understand by this term in the Alps. At the extreme limit of Nordenskj old's second excursion he found a tract of slushy snow and water, which was manifestly the neutral border between the zones of waste and groAvth, for that season at least. Through out his journey, except in the last few miles, he encountered a surface covered Avith kryo konite and pitted by superficial melting, which had manifestly removed not only the last season's snoAvs but was Avorking into tbe old ice. On the other hand, the Laps, who advanced into the interior for over fifty miles farther, found unmelted snoAV prevailing, and were driven back from want of water, indi cating that they had reached the true neve. We may, therefore, take it for granted that in mid-Greenland the neutral zone lies approxi mately one hundred miles distant from the edge of the mer de glace.\u00a7 Yet in spite of these very patent facts, Baron Nordenskjold formulated the theory that beyond this dreary expanse the country is entirely free from ice, and probably Avooded, being Avarmed by the southerly Avind Avhich reaches the interior as a dry breeze. To confirm this theory his expedition of 1883 was undertaken, though its main result \u2014 it is perhaps unnecessary to say \u2014 was simply to confirm the view it was intended to dis prove. Curiously enough, General Greely has also taken up this notion, from finding ice-bare spots in the interior of Grinnell Land. But this gallant officer never saAv the inland ice of Greenland, or he could never have confounded it Avith the totally different feature of the Avestern shores of Smith's Sound. In the South Polar region (Fig. 8) the icebergs are flat-topped, and, it is affirmed, sometimes 800 feet high, the ice evidently sliding off flat islands ; in the upper reaches of Smith's Sound similar \"floebergs\" (Fig. 199) have been seen, due, no doubt, to similar causes. The Arctic iceberg is the seaAvard end of the glacier which has protruded under the sea, buoyed up by the water until it detaches itself. But it has been virtually detached long before it reaches the sea, the great crevasses being the means by which the size of icebergs is fixed. The sea only serves to float away what has already been separated from tbe parent glacier. The size of bergs therefore varies infinitely. The loftiest of which Ave have any accurate measurement is one mentioned by Hayes, which Avas 315 feet above the Avater, || * Brown : \"Das Innere von Gronland\" (Petermann's Geographische Mittheilungen, October, 1870) ; and \" Arctic Papers of the Royal Geographical Society,\" pp. 1-71. t In about lat. 69\u00b0 30' N., long. 10\" W.

But as the size of a berg is dependent on the height of the glacier end from which it \" calves,\" and as this may \u2014 as in the case of the Humboldt Glacier\u2014 be sixty miles broad, it does not often happen that they can be the whole height and breadth of the \"sermik soak \" or great ice Avail of the Eskimo.* As these Arctic glaciers are rarely more than short tongues from the inland ice, it also seldom happens that they carry loads of moraine. Moraine is, indeed, rarely seen on the Greenland glaciers, and Avhen there is any, it is usually capsized in the terrible turmoil Avhich accompanies the birth of an iceberg. More over, by the Avaves constantly Avearing away their base, bergs so frequently capsize after they are free that the end uppermost is rarely the end which formed the upper surface of the glacier. The fantastic figures which appear in books have seldom any counter part in Nature, for it is the fashion of artists to take liberties with Nature and to group the exceptional bergs as if they were commonly seen together. Yet among the vast fleets Avhich are constantly seen sailing out of Jakobshavn Fjord, hard by which the writer lived for a summer, may be wit nessed ice mountains of shapes quite as fantastic as any which the imagination of the draughtsman has grouped together. Finally, it may be added, that the mud-laden sub glacial rivers are filling up the Greenland Fjords, as they have filled up many of the Norwegian ones, with a fine laminated clay \u2014 in which shellfish burroAv \u2014 undistinguishable in its character from the brick clays of Scot land and other parts of the Northern Hemi sphere. This adds one more proof that the laws of Nature have never altered, that the old order changeth not, and that to understand the Past Ave must look to the Present, instead of inventing hypothetical cataclysms and catastrophes, which both in kind and in de gree are exceptional in the World's history.f f In addition to the works already mentioned, the reader may be referred for further particulars regarding Polar ice to three papers by the late Dr. Moss, R.N., of the Arctic Expedition of 1875-76, and the author in Science for All, Vol. I., p. 33, Vol. IL, p. 356, and Vol. V., p. 328. Professor James Geikie's \" Great Ice Age \" also contains an admirable account of most glacial phenomena, though that of the Greenland ice is more imperfect ; while the works of Baron v. Nordenskjold, especially in their English translations, must be read with much caution, as his theories are open to question, and his statements are not always as accurate as he seems to consider those opposed to his views erroneous. Greely's volumes are valuable, though he is in error regarding the inland ice of Green land, which he never saw, and appears to entirely mis apprehend. Payer is good, so far as he goes, but Nares and De Long are rather meagre, and not always right. * An iceberg described by Ross and Parry was 2\\ .miles broad and 153 feet high ; so that, assuming the form to have been approximately that of a cone reared on an elliptical base, it has been calculated that the ice above water would be something like 150 million tons, and that the entire mass weighed not far from 1,500 million tons. Even after allowing that the dimensions given for some of the Antarctic icebergs \u2014 800 to 1,000 feet high, and nearly 3 miles long \u2014 are exaggerated, it is impossible to assign to them exactly the same origin as those of the Arctic regions ; though, as we have indicated (p. 375), this is a difference more nominal than real. Northern icebergs have been known to float as far South as lat. 36\u00b0 N.. while those of the South Polar Region have been seen off the Cape of Good Hope in lat. 34\u00b0 S."], [389, "(To be comvleted in 18 Parts.)
