S I R, T A HE author of the following Eclogue, having requcfted my aflift- ance to introduce it to the world ; it was with more indignation than furprize I was informed of your having ufed your extenfive influence over the prefs to prevent its being advertifed in the News-papers. How are you, Sir, concerned in the Lamentation of Rofcius for his Nyky ? Does your modefty think no man entitled to the appellation of Rofcius but yourfelf? Does Nyky refemble any nick-named fa- vourite of yours ? Or does it follow, that if you have cherifhed an un- worthy favourite, you muft bear too near a refemblance to him ? \u00a3>ui capit Ule facit ; beware of felf-accufation, where others bring no charge ! Or, granting vou right in thefe particulars, by what right or privilege do you, Sir, fet up for a licenfer of the prefs ? That you have long fuccefsfully ufurped that privilege, to fwell both your fame and fortune, is well known. Not the puffs of the quacks of Bayf- water and Chelfea are fo numerous and notorious : but by what au- thority do you take upon you to fhut up the general channel, in which writers ufhpr their performances to the public ? If they at- tack either your talents or your character, in utrumque paratus, you are armed to defend yourlelf. You have, befides your ingenuous countenance and confeious innocence ; Nil confeire fibi, nulla pal- lefcere culpa ; Befides this brazen bulwark, I fay, you have a ready pen and a long purfe. The prefs is open to the one, and the bar is ever ready to open with the other. For a poor author, not a printer will publifh a paragraph, not a pleader will utter a quib- ble. You have then every advantage in the conteft : It is need\" lefs, therefore, to endeavour to intimidate your antagonifts by countenancing your retainers to threaten their lives ! Thefe in- timidations, let me tell you Sir, have an ugly, fufpicious look. They are befides needlefs ; the genus trrhabile vatum want no fuch perfonal provocations ; Heaven knows, the life ofaplay-wright, like that of a fpider, is in a ftate of the moft {lender dependency. It is well for my rhiming friend that his hangs not on fo flight a thread. He thinks, neverthelefs, that he has reafon to complain, as well as the publick, of your having long preferred the flimzy, tranflated, patch'd-up and mif-altered pieces of your favourite com pilers, to the arduous attempts at originality of writers, who have no perfonal intereft with the manager. In particular, he thinks r A 2 the"], [8, "[ iii ] the two pieces, you are proje&ing to get up next winter, for the emolument of your favorite in difgrace, or to reimhurfe yourfelf the money, you may have advanced him, might, for the prefent at leaft, be laid afide. \\ But you will afk me, perhaps, in turn, Sir, what right 1 have to interfere with the bufinefs of other people, or with yours r I will ahfwer vou. It 'is becaufe I think your bufinefs, as patentee of a theatre-royal, is not fo entirely yours, but that the publick alfo have fome concern in it.

But nemo me ivipune Paceffit. Not that I nifjan now to enter, into particulars which may be thought to relate too nuich to myfelf and too, little to the pubfick.
