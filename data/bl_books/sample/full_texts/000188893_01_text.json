In the history of Utah we come upon a new series of social phenomena, whose multiformity and uncon ventionality awaken the liveliest interest. We find ourselves at ooce outside the beaten track of conquest for gold and glory ; of wholesale robberies and human slaughters for the love of Christ; of encomiendas, re partimientos, serfdoms, or other species of civilized imposition; of missionary invasion resulting in cer tain death to the aborigines, but in broad acres and well filled storehouses for the men of practical piety; of emigration for rich and cheap lands, or for coloni zation and empire alone; nor have we here a hurried scramble for wealth, or a corporation for the manage ment of a game preserve. There is the charm of novelty about the present subject, if no other; for in our analyses of human progress we never tire of watch ing the behavior of various elements under various conditions. There is only one example in the annals of Amer ica of the organization of a commonwealth upon prin ciples of pure theocracy. There is here one example only where the founding of a state grew out of the founding of a new religion. Other instances there have been of the occupation of wild tracts on this con- tinent by people flying before persecution, or desirouB (V)"], [12, "PREFACE. VI of greater religious liberty; there were the quakers, the huguenots, and the pilgrim fathers, though their spiritual interests were so soon subordinated to politi cal necessities; religion has often played a conspicu ous part in the settlement of the New World, and there has at times been present in some degree the theocratic, if not indeed the hierarchal, idea; but it has been long since the world, the old continent or the new, has witnessed anything like a new religion suc cessfully established and set in prosperous running or der upon the fullest and combined principles of theoc racy, hierarchy, and patriarchy. With this new series of phenomena, a new series of difficulties arises in attempting their elucidation: not alone the perplexities always attending unexplored fields, but formidable embarrassments which render the task at once delicate and dangerous. If the writer is fortunate enough to escape the many pitfalls of fallacy and illusion which beset his wajr; if he is wise and successful enough to find and follow the exact line of equity which should be drawn between the hotly contending factions ; in a word, if he is honest and capable, and speaks honestly and openly in the treatment of such a subject, he is pretty sure to offend, and bring upon himself condemnation from all parties. But where there are palpable faults on both sides of a case, the judge who unites equity with due discrimination may be sure he is not in the main far from right if he succeeds in offending both sides. Therefore, amidst the multiformity of conflicting ideas and evidence, having abandoned all hope of satisfying others, I fall back upon the next most reasonable prop osition left \u2014 that of satisfying myself."], [13, "PREFACE. VII in regard to the quality of evidence I here encoun ter, I will say that never before has it been my lot to meet with such a mass of mendacity. The attempts of almost all who have written upon the subject seem to have been to make out a case rather than to state the facts. Of course, by any religious sect dealing largely in the supernatural, fancying itself under the direct guidance of God, its daily doings a standing miracle, commingling in all the ordinary affairs of life prophecies, special interpositions, and revelations with agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, we must ex pect to find much written which none but that sect can accept as true. And in relation to opposing evidence, almost every book that has been put forth respecting the people of Utah by one not a Mormon is full of calumny, each author apparently endeavoring to surpass his predecessor in the libertinism of abuse. Most of these are written in a sensational style, and for the purpose of deriving profit by pandering to a vitiated public taste, and are wholly unreliable as to facts. Some few, more especially among those first appear ing, whose data were gathered by men upon the spot, and for the purpose of destroying what they regarded as a sacrilegious and pernicious fanaticism, though as vehement in their opposition as any, make some pretensions to honesty and sincerity, and are more worthy of credit. There is much in govern ment reports, and in the writings of the later resi dents in Utah, dictated by honest patriotism, and to which the historian should give careful attention. In using my authorities, I distinguish between these classes, as it is not profitable either to pass by any thing illustrating principles or affecting progress, or"], [14, "VIII PREFACE. to print pages of pure invention, palpable lies, even for the purpose of proving them such. Every work upon the subject, however, receives proper bibliograph ical notice. The materials for Mormon church history are exceptionally full. Early in his career the first presi dent appointed a historiographer, whose office has been continuous ever since. To his people he himself gave their early history, both the inner and intangi ble and the outer and material portions of it. Then missionaries to different posts were instructed to make a record of all pertinent doings, and lodge the same in the church archives. A sacred obligation seems to have been implied in this respect from the beginning, the Booh of Mormon itself being largely descriptive of such migrations and actions as usually constitute the history of a people. And save in the matters of spir itual manifestations, which the merely secular histo rian cannot follow, and in speaking of their enemies, whose treatment we must admit in too many instances has been severe, the church records are truthful and reliable. In addition to this, concerning the settle ment of the country, I have here, as in other sections of my historical field, visited the people in person, and gathered from them no inconsiderable stores of orig inal and interesting information. Upon due consideration, and with the problem fairly before me, three methods of treatment pre sented themselves from which to choose: first, to follow the beaten track of calumny and vituperation, heaping upon the Mormons every species of abuse, from the lofty sarcasm employed by some to the vul gar scurrility applied by others; second, to espouse"], [15, "PREFACE. IX the cause of the Mormons as the weaker party, and defend them from the seeming inj ustice to which from the first they have been subjected; third, in a spirit of equity to present both sides, leaving the reader to draw his own conclusions. The first course, however popular, would be beyond my power to follow; the second method, likewise, is not to be considered; I therefore adopt the third course, and while giving the new sect a full and respectful hearing, withhold nothing that their most violent opposers have to say against them. Anything written at the present day which may properly be called a history of Utah must be largely a history of the Mormons, these being the first white people to settle in the country, and at present largely occupying it. As others with opposing interests and influences appear, they and the great principles thereby brought to an issue receive the most careful considera tion. And I have deemed it but fair, in presenting the early history of the church, to give respectful consid eration to and a sober recital of Mormon faith and experiences, common and miraculous. The story of Mormonism, therefore, beginning with chapter iii., as told in the text, is from the Mormon standpoint, and based entirely on Mormon authorities; while in 'the notes, and running side by side with the subject matter in the text, I give in full all anti-Mormon arguments and counter-statements, thus enabling the reader to carry along both sides at once, instead of having to consider first all that is to be said on one side, and then all that is to be said on the other. In following this plan, I only apply to the history of Utah the same principles employed in all my his torical efforts, namely, to give all the facts on every"], [16, "PREFACE. side pertinent to the subject. In giving the history of the invasion and occupation of the several sections of the Pacific States from Panama to Alaska, I have been obliged to treat of the idiosyncrasies, motives, and actions of Roman catholics, methodists, presby terians, episcopalians, and members of the Greek church: not of the nature or validity of their re spective creeds, but of their doings, praising or blam ing as praise or blame were due, judged purely from a standpoint of morals and humanity according to the highest standards of the foremost civilization of the world. It was not necessary \u2014 it was wholly outside the province of the historian, and contrary to my method as practised elsewhere \u2014 to discuss the truth or falsity of their convictions, any more than when writing the history of Mexico, California, or Oregon to advance my opinions regarding the in spiration of the scriptures, the divinity of Christ, prophecies, miracles, or the immaculate conception. On all these questions, as on the doctrines of the Mormons and of other sects, I have of course my opinions, which it were not only out of place but odious to be constantly thrusting upon the attention of the reader, who is seeking for facts only. In one respect only I deem it necessary to go a little further here: inasmuch as doctrines and beliefs enter more influentially than elsewhere into the origin and evolution of this society, I give the history of the rise and progress of those doctrines. Theirs was not an old faith, the tenets of which have been fought for and discussed for centuries, but professedly a new reve lation, whose principles are for the most part unknown to the outside world, where their purity is severely questioned. The settlement of this section sprung"], [17, "PREFACE. XI primarily from the evolution of a new religion, with all its attendant trials and persecutions. To give their actions without their motives would leave the work obviously imperfect; to give their motives with out the origin and nature of their belief would be impossible. In conclusion, I will say that those who desire a knowledge of people and events impartially viewed, a statement of facts fairly and dispassionately pre sented, I am confident will find them here as else where in my writings."], [18, ""], [19, "PASS CONTENTS OF THIS VOLUME.

As Francisco Vazquez de Coronado was journeying from Culiacan to the north and east in 1540, he rested at Cibola, that is to say Zuhi, and while waiting for the main army to come forward, expeditions were sent out in various directions. One of these, consisting of twenty men under Pedro de Tobar, and attended by Father Juan de Padilla, proceeded north-westward, and after five days reached Tusayan, or the Moqui villages, which were quickly captured. Among other matters of interest, information was here given of a large river yet farther north, the people who lived upon its banks being likewise very large. Returning to Cibola, Tobar reported what had been said concerning this river ; whereupon Captain Garcia Lopez de Cardenas was sent with twelve men to explore it, Pedro de Sotomayor accompanying to id"], [56, "2 DISCOVERIES OF THE SPANIARDS. chronicle the expedition. Obtaining at Tusayan, where he was well received, guides and carriers, with an ample supply of provisions, Cardenas marched for twenty days, probably in a north-westerly direction,1 1 1 say probably, though in my own mind there is little doubt. The Span- iards were exploring northward. They had lately traversed the region to their south-west, and instead of wishing to retrace their steps they would be likely to keep up well away from their former track. It is true that one nar- rative gives the direction as west; but then the same writer places Tusan, or Tusayan, west of Cibola, which if the latter be Zuni, and the former Moqui, is incorrect. Then, if their direction from the Moqui towns was the same as this writer declares it to have been in travelling to that place, the Spaniards at this time certainly struck the Colorado within the limits of the present Utah. Escalante, Carta de 28 Oct. 1775, MS., placed Moqui west of Zufii, but a little north of west, with the Yutas their neighbor on the north. It is sufficiently plain that Cibola was Zuui, and Tusayan Moqui, and as a matter of fact the latter is in a north-westerly direction from the former. That they went due west and crossed the Little Colorado without any mention of that stream is not likely; because, first, it is not twenty days distant from the Moquis, and the stream when reached does not answer to their description. It was the great river they wished to find, and a north- west course would be the most direct. Further than this, it is stated plainly that the point at which they discovered the river was much nearer its source than where the Spaniards had previously seen it. Upon the direction then taken hangs the question as to the first Europeans to enter Utah. I deem the matter of sufficient importance to give both the originals and the translations of two of the most complete and reUable narratives of the expedition. The first and fullest we find in the Relation de Castaiieda of Coronado's expedi- tion, Ternaux-Compans, serie i. torn. ix. 61-5, which reads as follows: 'Comme don Pedro de Tobar avait rempli sa mission, il revint surges pas et rendit compte au general de ce qu'il avait vu. Celui-ci fit partir sur-le- champ don Garci-Lopez de Cardenas et douze autres personnes pour aUer visiter cette riviere ; cet officier fut tres-bien recu et parfaitement traite par les indiens de Tusayan, qui lui donnerent des guides pour continuer sa route. Nos soldats partnent charges de vivres, les indiens les ayant avertis qu'il fallait traverser un desert de vingt journees de long avant d'entrer dans un pays habito. Apres ces vingt journees de marche ils arriverent en effet a cette riviere, dont les bords sont tellement eleves qu'ils croyaient etre a trois ou quatre lieues en l'air. Le pays est couvert de pins bas et rabougris; il est expose au nord, et le froid y est si violent, que, quoique Ton fut en ete, ou pouvait a peme le supporter. Les Espagnols marcherent pendant trois jours le long de ces montagnes, esperant toujours trouver une descente pour arriver a la riviere qui, d'en haut, ne paraissait pas avoir plus d'une brasse de large, et qui, selon les Indiens, avait plus d'une demi-lieue; mais il fut impossible de s y rendre. Etant parvenus deux ou trois jours apres dans un endroit ou la descente leur parut plus facile, le capitaine Melgosa, Juan Galeras et un soldat qui etaient les plus legers de la bande, resolurent de faire une tenta- tive. 11s descendirent jusqu'a ce que ceux qui etaient restes en haut les eussent perdus de ven. Hs revinrent vers les quatre heures du soir, disant quils avaient trouvetant de difficulty, qu'ils n'avaient pu arriver jusqu'en bas; car ce qui d'en haut semblait facile, ne l'etait pas du tout quand <m approchait. Ils ajoutorent qu'ils etaient parvenus a environ un tiers de la descente, et que de 14, la riviere paraissait deja tres grande, ce qui confirmait ce que les indiens avaient dit. Us assurerent que quelques rochers que Ton voyait d en haut, et qui paraissait a peine de la hauteur d'un homme etaient plus hauts que la tour de la cathedrale de Seville. Les Espagnols cesserent"], [57, "EXPEDITION OF CARDENAS. through a desert country until he discovered the river, but from such high banks that he could not reach it. It was the river called the Tizon, and it flowed from the north-east toward the south-west. It seemed to the Spaniards when they first descried it that they were on mountains through which the river had cut de suivre les rochers qui bordent la riviere, parce qu'on y manquait d'eau. Jusque-la ils avaient etc obliges chaque soir de s'avancer une lieue ou deux dans l'interieur pour en trouver. Quand ils eurent marchc pendant trois ou quatre jours, les guides lour declarerent qu'il etait impossible d'aller plus loin, qu'on ne trouverait pas d'eau de quatre jours ; que quand les Indiens passaient cette route, ils cmmenaient avec eux des femmes chargees de cale basses remplies d'eau, et qu'ils en enterraient une partie pour les retrouvei au retour; que d'ailleurs ils parcouraient en un jour autant de chemin que les Espagnols en deux. Cette riviere etait celle del Tizon. On arriva beau coup plus pres de sa source que de l'endroit ou Melchior Diaz et ses gens l'avaient traversee, et Ton sut plus tard que les Indiens dont on avait parle etaient de la meme nation que ceux que Diaz avait vus. Les Espagnols revinrent done sur leurs pas, et cette expedition n'eut pas d'autre resultat. Pendant la marche, ils arriverent & une cascade qui tombait d'un rocher. Les guides dirent que les cristaux blancs qui pendaient a l'entour etaient du sel. On en recueillit une quantity que Ton emporta, et qu'on distribua a Cibola, oil Ton rendit compte par ecrit au general de tout ce que l'on avai> vu. Garci-Lopez avait eminent avec lui un certain Pedro de Sotomayor, qui etait chroniqueur de l'expedition. Tous les villages de cette province sont restes nos allies, mais on ne les a pas visites depuis, et l'on n'a tente aucune decouverte de ce c6te. ' As soon as Don Pedro de Tobar had fulfilled his mission, he returned and gave the general an account of what he had seen. The latter immediately ordered Don Garci-Lopez de Cardenas, and 12 other persons, to go and visit that river; this oflicer was well received and politely treated by the Indians of Tusayan, who furnished him with guides to continue his journey. Out soldiers departed loaded with provisions, the Indians having notified them that it was necessary to travel 20 days through a desert before entering any inhabited country. After this 20 days' march, they arrived at that river whose banks are of such a height that it seemed to them that they were three or four leagues up in the air. The country is covered with low and stunted pines, exposed to the north, and the cold is so violent that, although it was summer, cne could hardly endure it. The Spaniards during three days skirted those mountains, always in the hope of finding a descent to reach the river, which from above appeared to be no more than a fathom in width, and which, according to the Indians, was more than half a league wide; but all their efforts were vain. Two or three days later, they arrived at a place where the descent seemed easier; Captain Melgosa Juan Galeras and a soldier who were the lightest men of the band, resolved to make an attempt. They descended until those who bad remained on the top had lost sight of them. They returned at about four o'clock in the afternoon, saying they had found so many difficulties that they could not reach the bottom ; for, what seemed easy from above was not at all so when approaching the water. They added that they caine down about one third of the descent, and that even from there the river seemed very large. This statement confirmed what the Indians had said. The three men affirmed that some rocks seen from above and which appeared to be of the height of a man, were higher than the tower of the cathedral of Seville. The Spaniards stopped following the rocks that bordered the river on account of the lack of water. Until then, they had been obliged to advance one or two leagues in the interior to find"], [58, "DISCOVERIES OF THE SPANIARDS. 4 a chasm only a few feet 'wide, but which if they might believe the natives was half a league across. In vain for several days, with their faces toward the south and west, they sought to escape from the mountains that environed them, and descend to the river, for they were suffering from thirst. At length some. When they had marched during three or four days, the guides declared to them that it was impossible to go further, that water would not be found before four clays; that when the Indians travelled on this road, they took with them women who carried calabashes filled with water, and they buried a certain part, so that they might find it when returning; and besides they made in one day as many miles as the Spaniards would in two. This was the river del Tizon. They arrived much nearer to its source than the place where Melchor Diaz and his people had crossed, and it was known later that the Indians spoken of belonged to the same nation as those seen by Diaz. The Spaniards therefore came back, and the expedition had no other result. While marching, they arrived at a cascade falling from a rock. The guides affirmed that the white crystals hanging around were salt. A quantity of it was gathered, carried away, and distributed at Cibola, where a written account of all that had been seen was sent to the general.

He was given 80 days in which to make the journey, from his departure until his return. He went on b-syond Tuzan, accompanied by Indian guides, who told him that farther on there was a settlement. Having gone 50 leagues to the westward of Tuzan, and 60 from Cibola, he came to the canon of a river adown the side of which there was no descent practicable for horse, nor even for those on foot, except"], [59, "ATTEMPT TO REACH THE RTVER. 5 one morning three of the lightest and most active of the party crept over the brink and descended until they were out of sight.

The side of the cauon was of rock so steep that the river was uarely discernible, although, according to report, it is as great as the river of Seville, or greater; and from above appeared a brook. During many days, and in many places, a way by which to pass the river was sought in vain. During this time there was much suffering from a lack of water, for although that of the river was in view, it was unattainable. For this reason Don Garcia Lopez was forced to return. This river conies from the north-east, and makes a bend to the south-south-eastward; hence, beyond a doubt, it must be that reached by Melchor Diaz.

New Mexico had now been known nearly two and a half centuries; the city of Santa Fe had been founded over a century and a half, Monterey had been occu pied since 1770, and yet there had been opened no direct route westward with the sea, communication between Mexico and Santa Fe\" being by land, the road following the Rio Grande. In his memorial of March 1773, while in Mexico, Father Junipero Serra had urged that two expeditions be made, one from Sonora to California, which was carried out the fol lowing year by Captain Anza, and one from New Mexico to the sea, which Dominguez and Escalante now proposed to undertake. Again in 1775 Anza made a similar journey, this time leaving at the junc tion of the Colorado and Gila Father Garce\"s who ascended the former stream to the Mojave country, whence crossing to Mission San Gabriel he proceeded to the Tulare Valley. There he heard from the na tives of a great river coming in from the east or north east.2 Indeed it was long the prevailing opinion that there existed such a stream in that vicinity. From the Tulare country Garcds returned to San Gabriel and Mojave, and thence proceeded to the villages of the Moquis. From this place he probably wrote to Santa Fe concerning the rumor of this river; for all through the journey of Dominguez and Escalante they were in search of it.8 2 On Father Font's map, 1777, are laid down two rivers entering the region of the Tulare lakes from the north-east, one the Rio de San Phelipe, and the other called the Rio de que se Viene Noticia por el P.

And last of all it may be that the rumor of Pueblo villages in this quarter car ried the explorers further north than otherwise they would have gone. However this may have been, they were now of opinion that they had penetrated far enough in a northerly direction, and from this point must take a southerly course.

The valley which surrounds this lake extends from south-east to north-west sixteen Spanish leagues ; it is quite level, and has a width of ten or twelve leagues. Except the marshes on the lake borders the land is good for agriculture. Of the four rivers which water the valley the southernmost, which they call Aguas Calientes, passes through rich meadows capable of supporting two large towns. The second, three leagues from the first, flowing northerly, and which they call the San Nicolas, fer tilizes enough good land to support one large town or two smaller ones.

They might cap ture some buffaloes in the north-north-west but for the troublesome Comanches.19 They dwell in huts of osier, of which, likewise, many of their utensils are made; some of them wear clothes, the best of which are of the skins of rabbits and antelopes. There are in this region many people, of whom he who would know more may consult the Native Races. The Spaniards are further told by the Yutas of a large and wonderful body of water toward the north west, and this is what Father Escalante reports of it. \"The other lake, with which this communicates,\" he says, \"occupies, as they told us, many leagues, and its waters are injurious and extremely salt; because the Timpanois20 assure us that he who wets any part of his body with this water, immediately feels an itch ing in the wet part. We were told that in the circuit of this lake there live a numerous and quiet nation, called Puaguampe, which means in our language Sor cerers; they speak the Comanche language, feed on herbs, and drink from various fountains or springs of good water which are about the lake; and they have their little houses of grass and earth, which latter forms the roof. They are not, so they intimated, enemies of those living on this lake, but since a certain time when the people there approached and killed a man, they do not consider them as neutral as before. 19 This is directly opposite the direction in which we would expect to find the Comanches of to-day; but the Utes applied the term comanche to all hostile Indians.

Half a century passes, and we find United States fur hunters standing on the border of the Great Salt Lake, tasting its brackish waters, and wondering if it is an arm of the sea.1 1 There are those who soberly refer to the Baron la Hontan and his prodi gious falsehoods of 16S9 for the lirst information of Great Salt Lake. Because among the many fabulous wonders reported he somewhere on the western side of the continent placed a body of bad-tasting water, Stansbury, Expect, 151, does not hesitate to affirm 'that the existence of a large lake of salt water somewhere amid the wilds west of the Rocky Mountains seems to have been known vaguely as long as 150 years since.' Perhaps it was salt, and not silver that the Wiunebagoes reported to Carver, Travels, 33-6, as coming down in caravans from 'the mountains lying near the heads of the Colorado River.' Warren, in Pacific Railroad Report, xi. 34, repeats and refutes the La Hon tan myth. He says, ' the story of La Hontan excited much speculation, and received various additions in his day; and the lake finally became represented on the published English maps.' Long before this date, however, reliable in formation had been received by the Spaniards, and the same may have come to English trappers; so that by 1826 reports of the existence of such a sheet may have reached civilization. It is needless to say that neither La Hontan nor Carver ever received information from the natives, or elsewhere, sufficient to justify map-makers in placing a large lake in that vicinity.

It happened in this wise. During the winter of 1824-5 a party of trappers, who had ascended the Missouri with Henry and Ashley, found we have no certain account. Two have been noticed in the western parts, a salt lake about the thirty-ninth degree of latitude, the western limits of which are unknown, and the lake of Timpanogos, about the forty -first degree, of great but unascertained extent. ' Map of Utah, 1826. In a report submitted to congress May 15, 1826, by Mr BayUes it is stated that ' many geographies have placed the Lake Timpanogos in latitude 40 but they have obviously confounded it with the Lake Iheguayo, which extends from 39\u00b0 40' to 41\u00b0, and from which it appears separated by a neck or penin sula; the two lakes approaching iu one direction as near as 20 miles. 19th Con, 1st Sess., House Rept.

A discussion arose as to the probable course of Bear River, which flowed on both sides of them. A wager was made, and Bridger sent to ascertain the truth. Following the river through the mountains the first view of the great lake fell upon him, and when he went to the margin and tasted the water he found that it was salt. Then he returned and re ported to his companions. All were interested to know if there emptied into this sheet other streams on which they might find beavers, and if there was an outlet; hence in the spring of 1826 four men ex plored the lake in skin boats.2 During this memorable year of 1825, when Peter sional report, by one Samuel Adams Ruddock, that in the year 1821 he journeyed from Council Bluff to Santa Fe, and thence with a trading party proceeded by way of Great Salt Lake to Oregon. The report says : ' On the 9th of June this party crossed the Rio del Norte, and pursuing a north-west direction on the north bank of the river Chamas, and over the mountains, reached Lake Trinidad; and then pursuing the same direction across the upper branches of the Rio Colorado of California, reached Lake Timpanagos, which is intersected by the 42d parallel of latitude, the boundary between the United States of America and the United States of Mexico. This lake is the principal source of the river Timpanagos, and the Multnomah of Lewis and Clarke. They then followed the course of this river to its junction with the Columbia, and reached the mouth of the Columbia on the first day of August, completing the journey from the Council Bluffs in seventy-nine days. ' 2 This, upon the testimony of Robert Campbell, Pac. R. Rept., xi. 35, who was there'at the time 'and found the party just returned from the exploration of the lake, and recollect their report that it was without any outlet. ' Bridger's story of his discovery was corrroborated by Samuel Tullock in Campbell's counting-room in St Louis at a later date. Campbell pronounces them both 'men of the strictest integrity and truthfulness.' Likewise Ogden 's trappers met Bridger's party m the summer of 1825 and were told of the discovery See Hist. Nevada, this series. Irving, BonnevUle's Adv., 186, says it was probably Sublette who sent out the four men in the skin canoe in 1826 Bonne- ville professes to doubt this exploration because the men reported that thev suffered severely from thirst, when in fact several fine streams flow into the lake; but Bonneville desired to attach to his name the honor of an early sur- vey, and detract from those entitled to it. The trappers in their canoes did not pretend to make a thorough survey, and as for scarcity of fresh water in places Stansbury says Exped 103, that during his explorations he frequently was obliged to send fifty miles for water. Other claimants appear prior to Bridger s discovery. W M Anderson writing to the National Intelligencer under date of Feb 26, 1860 says that Provost trapped in this vicinity in 1820 and that Ashley was there before Bridger. Then it was said by Seth Grant that his partner, Vazquez, discovered the great inland sea, calling it an Tumr ,bef\"se the water was salt.

Beckwourth was pursuing his daring adventures, and the region round the great lakes of Utah first became familiar to American trappers, William H. Ashley, of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, at the head of one hundred and twenty men and a train of well packed horses, came out from St Louis, through the South Pass and down by Great Salt Lake to Lake Utah. There he built a fort, and two years later brought from St Louis a six-pounder which thereafter graced its court. Ashley was a brave man, shrewd and honest; he was prosperous and commanded the respect of his men. Nor may we impute to him lack of intelligence, or of common geographical knowledge, when we find him seriously considering the project of descending the Colorado in boats, by means of which he would eventually reach St Louis. Mr Green, who gave his name to Green River, had been with Ashley the previous year; and now for three years after the establishing of Fort Ashley at Utah Lake, Green with his trappers occupied the country to the west and north.3 'See Hist. Northwest Coast, ii. 447-8, this series. T. D. Bonner in his Life and Adventures of James P. Beckwourth, 71-3, gives what purports to be an account of Ashley's descent of Green River to Great Salt Lake on a certain occasion in Ashley's own language. There may be some truth in it all, though Beckwourth is far astray in his dates, as he places the occurrence in 1822. Beckwourth goes on to say that one day in June a beautiful Indian girl offered him a pair of moccasins if he would shoot for her an antelope and bring her the brains, that with them she might dress a deer-skin. Beckwourth started out, but failing to secure an antelope, and seeing as he supposed an Indian coming, he thought he would shoot the Indian and take his brains to the girl, who would not know the difference. Just as he was about to fire he discovered the supposed Indian to be Ashley, who thereupon told him of his adventures down Green Biver and through the canon to Great Salt Lake. I have no doubt it is three fourths fiction, and what there is of fact must be placed forward four years. 'We had a very dangerous passage down the river,' said Ashley to Beckwourth, 'and suffered more than I ever wish to see men suffer again. You are aware that we took but little provision with us, not expecting that the canon extended so far. In passing over the rapids, where we lost two boats and three guns, we made use of ropes in letting down our boats over the most dangerous places. Our provisions soon gave out. We found plenty of beaver in the canon for some miles, and, expectmg to find them in as great plenty all the way, we saved none of their carcasses, which constituted our food. As we proceeded, however, they became more and more scarce, until there were none to be seen, and we were entirely out of provisions.

Our only alternative was to go ahead. After passing six days without food, the men were weak and disheartened. I listened to all their murmurings and heart-rending complaints. They often spoke of home and friends, declaring they would never see them more. Some spoke of wives and children whom they dearly loved, and who must shortly become widows and orphans. They had toiled, they said, through every difficulty; had risked their lives among wild beasts and hostile Indians in the wilderness, all of which they were will- ing to undergo; but who could bear up against actual starvation? I en- couraged them all in my power, telling them that I bore an equal part in their sufferings; that I too was toiling for those I loved, and whom I yet hoped to see again; that we should all endeavor to keep up our courage, and not add to our misfortunes by giving way to despondency. Another night was passed amid the barren rocks. Tho next morning the fearful proposition was made by some of the party for the company to cast lots, to see which should be sacrificed to afford food for the others, without which they must inevitably perish. My feelings at such a proposition cannot be described. I begged of them to wait one day more, and make all the way they could meanwhile. By doing so, I said, we must come to a break in the canon, whsre we could escape. They consented, and moving down the river as fast as the current would carry us, to our inexpressible joy we found a break, and a camp of trappers therein. All now rejoiced that they had not carried their fearful proposition into effect. We had fallen into good hands, and slowly recruited ourselves with the party, which was under the charge of one Provo, a man with whom I was well acquainted. By his advice we left the river and pro- ceeded in a north-westerly direction. Provo was well provided with pro- visions and horses, and he supplied us with both. We remained with his party until we arrived at the Great Salt Lake. Here I fell in with a large company of trappers, composed of Canadians and Iroquois Indians, under the command of Peter Ogden, in the service of the Northwest Fur Company. With this party I made a very good bargain, as you will see when they arrive at our camp, havmg purchased all their peltry on very reasonable terms.'

Then he reaches a fertile wooded valley which belongs to the Amajabes, or Mojaves, where the party rests fifteen days, meeting with the kindest treatment from the natives, who provide food and horses. Thence they are guided by two neo phytes westward through a desert country, and reach the mission of San Gabriel in December, their ap pearance causing no small commotion in California. After many strange adventures, fully narrated in my History of California, Smith works his way north ward up the San Joaquin Valley, and in May 1827 crosses the Sierra Nevada and returns eastward to Great Salt Lake.

He did not possess a very estimable charac ter, as, I am sorry to say, few of his class did in those days. The leaders of American fur companies, how ever, were exceptions, and in points of intelligence, integrity, and daring were in no wise behind their British brethren.7 From south-east to north-west a portion of Utah was traversed in the autumn of 1830 by a trapping party under William Wolfskill.

Nidever had suffered severely from the cold during the previous winter, and had come to the Green River rendezvous that season for the express purpose of joining some party for California or of forming such a party himself, having been informed that the climate there was milder than in the mountains where he had been.10 If the intention was, as Bonneville asserts, that this party should pass round the great lake, in their endeavor they presently found themselves in the midst of desolation, between wide sandy wastes and broad brackish waters; and to quench their thirst they hastened westward where bright snowy moun tains promised cooling streams.

A brief glance at the later visits of white men to Utah is all that is necessary in this place. The early emigrants to Oregon did not touch this territory, and those to California via Fort Bridger for the most part merely passed through leaving no mark.

Of the latter party were J. Bar tleson, C. M. Weber, Talbot H. Green, John Bid well, Josiah Belden, and twenty-seven others. Their adventures while in Utah were not startling. Little was known of the Salt Lake region,13 particularly of the country to the west of it. Mr Belden in his Historical Statement, which I number among my most valuable manuscripts, says: \" We struck Bear River some distance below where the town of Evanston now is, where the coal mines are, and the railroad passes, and followed the river down. It makes a long bend to the north there, and comes down to Salt Lake. We arrived at Soda Springs, on Bear River, and there we separated from the company of missionaries, who were going off towards Snake River or Columbia. There we lost the services of the guide Fitzpatrick. Several of our party who had started to go with us to California also left us there, having decided to go with the mis sionaries. Fitzpatrick advised us to give up our expedition and go with them to Fort Hall, one of the Hudson's Bay stations, as there was no road for us to follow, nothing was known of the country, and we had nothing to guide us, and so he advised us to give up the California project. He thought it was doubtful if we ever got there, we might get caught in the snow of the mountains and perish there, and he con sidered it very hazardous to attempt it.

No guide could be found, and Grant was not able greatly to enlighten them. The fur-trader could have told them much concerning the route to Oregon, but this way to California as an emigrant road had hardly yet been thought of. \"As we approached Salt Lake,\" writes Bid well,\" \"we were misled quite often by the mirage. The country too was obscured by smoke. The water in Bear River became too salt for use. The sage brush on the small hillocks of the almost level plain became so magnified as to look like trees. Hoping to find water, and supposing these imaginary trees to be growing on some stream, and knowing nothing about the distance to Salt Lake, we kept pushing ahead mile after mile. Our animals almost perished for want of water while we were travelling over this salt plain, which grew softer and softer till our wagons cut into the ground five or six inches, and it became impossible to haul them.

We had some knowledge of the lake from some of the trappers who had been there. We turned off more to the west and went round the northerly end of Salt Lake.

We had to make it into strong coffee to drink it.\" On the 20th of August the company rested while two of their number went out to explore. They found themselves encamped ten miles from the mouth of the river. Thence next day, Sunday, they took a north-west course, crossing their track of the Thursday previous; on the 23d they were in full view of Salt Lake.

Fremont likens himself to Bal boa discovering the Pacific; but no one else would think of doing so.

Next morning they were out on the lake, fearful every moment lest their air-blown boat should collapse and let them into the saline but beautiful transparent liquid. At noon they reached one of the low near islands and landed. They found there, washed up by the waves, a dark brown bank, ten or twenty feet in breadth, composed of the skins of worms, about the size of oats, while the rocky cliffs were whitened by incrustations of salt. Ascending to the highest point attainable they took a surround ing view, and called the place Disappointment Island,18 because they had failed to find the fertile lands and game hoped for. Then they descended to the edge of the water, constructed lodges of drift-wood, built fires, and spent the night there, returning next day in a rough sea to their mainland camp. Thence they proceeded north to Bear River, and Fort Hall, and on to Oregon.17 On his return by way of Klamath and Pyramid lakes, Fremont crossed the Sierra to Sutter Fort, proceeded up the San Joaquin into Southern California, and taking the old Spanish trail to the Rio Virgen followed the Wahsatch Mountains to Utah Lake.

But even these it is not necessary to follow in this connection, Utah along the emigrant road being by this time well known to travellers and others. With some it was a question while on the way whether they should go to Or egon or California.

Let us turn now to the east, where have been evolv ing these several years a new phase of society and a new religion, destined presently to enter in and take possession of this far-away primeval wilderness. For it is not alone by the power of things material that the land of the Yutas is to be subdued; that mysteri ous agency, working under pressure of high enthusi asm in the souls of men, defying exposure, cold, and hunger, defying ignominy, death, and the destruction of aii corporeal things in the hope of heaven's favors and a happy immortality, a puissance whose very breath of life is persecution, and whose highest glory is martyrdom \u2014 it is through this subtile and incom prehensible spiritual instrumentality, rather than from a desire for riches or any tangible advantage that the new Israel is to arise, the new exodus to be conducted, the new Canaan to be attained. Sixty years ago western New York was essentially a new country, Ohio and Illinois were for the most"], [91, "QUALITY OF MATERIAL. 37 part a wilderness, and Missouri was the United States limit, the lands beyond being held by the aborigines. There were some settlements between Lake Erie and the Mississippi River, but they were recent and rude, and the region was less civilized than savage. The people, though practically shrewd and of bright intel lect, were ignorant; though having within them the elements of wealth, they were poor. There was among them much true religion, whatever that may be, yet they were all superstitious \u2014 baptists, methodists, and presbyterians; there was little to choose between them. Each sect was an abomination to the others; the others were of the devil, doomed to eternal tor ments, and deservedly so. The bible was accepted literally by all, every word of it, prophecies, miracles, and revelations; the same God and the same Christ satisfied all; an infidel was a thing woful and unclean. All the people reasoned. How they racked their brains in secret, and poured forth loud logic in public, not over problems involving intellectual liberty, human rights and reason, and other like insignificant matters appertaining to this world, but concerning the world to come, and more particularly such momentous ques tions as election, justification, baptism, and infant damnation. Then of signs and seasons, God's ways and Satan's ways; likewise concerning promises and prayer, and all the rest, there was a credulity most re freshing. In the old time there were prophets and apostles, there were visions and miracles; why should it not be so during these latter days? It was time for Christ to come again, time for the millennial season, and should the power of the almighty be limited? There, was the arch-fanatic Miller, and his followers, predicting the end and planning accordingly. \"The idea that revelation from God was unattainable in this age, or that the ancient gifts of the gospel had ceased forever, never entered my head,\" writes a young quaker; and a methodist of that epoch says: \"We be lieved in the gathering of Israel, and in the restoration"], [92, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 38 of the ten tribes; we believed that Jesus would come to reign personally on the earth; we believed that there ought to be apostles, prophets, evangelists, pas tors, and teachers, as in former days, and that the gifts of healing and the power of God ought to be as sociated with the church.\" These ideas, of course, were not held by all; in many respects the strictly orthodox evangelical churches taught the contrary; but there was enough of this literal interpretation and license of thought among the people to enable them to accept in all honesty and sincerity any doctrine in harmony with these views. Such were the people and the place, such the at mosphere and conditions under which was to spring up the germ of a new theocracy, destined in its develop ment to accomplish the first settlement of Utah \u2014 a people and an atmosphere already sufficiently charged, one would think, with doctrines and dogmas, with vul gar folly and stupid fanaticism, with unchristian hate and disputation over the commands of God and the charity of Christ. All this must be taken into ac count in estimating character, and in passing judg ment on credulity; men of one time and place cannot with justice be measured by the standard of other times and places. Before entering upon the history of Mormonism, I would here remark, as I have before said in the pref ace to this volume, that it is my purpose to treat the subject historically, not as a social, political, or relig ious partisan, but historically to deal with the sect organized under the name of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as I would deal with any other body of people, thus carrying over Utah the^ same quality of work which I have applied to my entire field, whether in Alaska, California, or Central America. Whatever they may be, howsoever right eous or wicked, they are entitled at the hand of those desirous of knowing the truth to a dispassionate and"], [93, "METHOD OF TREATMENT. 39 respectful hearing, which they have never had. As a matter of course, where there is such warmth of feeling, such bitterness and animosity as is here dis played on both sides, we must expect to encounter in our evidence much exaggeration, and many untruth ful statements. Most that has been written on either side is partisan \u2014 bitterly so ; many of the books that have been published are full of vile and licentious abuse \u2014 disgustingly so. Some of the more palpable lies, some of the grosser scurrility and more blas phemous vulgarity, I shall omit altogether. Again, the history of the Mormons, which is the early history of Utah, is entitled in its treatment to this consideration, as differing from that of other sec tions of my work, and to this only \u2014 that whereas in speaking of other and older sects, as of the catholics in Mexico and California, and of the methodists and presbyterians in Oregon, whose tenets having long been established, are well known, and have no imme diate bearing aside from the general influence of re ligion upon the subjugation of the country, any anal ysis of doctrines would be out of place, such analysis in the present instance is of primary importance. Or dinarily, I say, as I have said before, that with the religious beliefs of the settlers on new lands, or of the builders of empire in any of its several phases, social and political, the historian has nothing to do, except in so far as belief influences actions and events. As to attempting to determine the truth or falsity of any creed, it is wholly outside of his province. Since the settlement of Utah grew immediately out of the persecution of the* Mormons, and since their persecutions grew out of the doctrines which they pro mulgated, it seems to me essential that the origin and nature of their religion should be given. And as they are supposed to know better than others what they believe and how they came so to believe, I shall let them tell their own story of the rise and progress of their religion, carrying along with it the commenta-"], [94, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 40 ries of their opponents; that is, giving in the text the narrative proper, and in the notes further informa tion, elucidation, and counter-statements, according to my custom. All this by no means implies, here or elsewhere in my work, that when a Mormon elder, a catholic priest, or a baptist preacher says he had a vision, felt within him some supernatural influence, or said a prayer which produced a certain result, it is proper or relevant for me to stop and dispute with him whether he really did see, feel, or experience as alleged. As to the material facts connected with the story of Mormonism, there is but little difference between the Mormons and their opposers; but in the reception and interpretation of acts and incidents, particularly in the acceptation of miraculous assertions and spirit ual manifestations, they are as widely apart as the two poles, as my text and notes clearly demonstrate. And finally, I would have it clearly understood that it is my purpose, here as elsewhere in all my historical efforts, to impart information rather than attempt to solve problems. In Sharon, Windsor county, Vermont, on the 23d of December, 1805, was born Joseph Smith junior, presently to be called translator, revelator, seer, prophet, and founder of a latter-day dispensation. When the boy was ten years old, his father, who was a farmer, moved with his family to Palmyra, Wayne county, New York, and four years afterward took up his abode some six miles south, at Manchester, On tario county. Six sons and three daughters com prised the family of Joseph and Lucy Smith, namely, Alvin, Hyrum, Joseph junior, Samuel Harrison, Will iam, Don Carlos, Sophronia, Catharine, and Lucy.1 _ Much has been said by the enemies of Mormonism against the Smith lamily. 'All who became intimate with them during this period [1820 to 1830] unite in representing the general character of old Joseph and wife the parents of the pretended prophet, as lazy, indolent, ignorant, and super-"], [95, "THE VISION. 41 There was much excitement over the subject of re ligion in this section at the time, with no small dis cussion of doctrines, methodist, baptist, and the rest; and about a year later, the mother and four of the children joined the presbyterians. But young Joseph was not satisfied with any of the current theologies, and he was greatly troubled what to do. Reading his bille one day, he came upon the passage, \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.\" He retired to the woods and threw himself upon his knees. It was his first attempt at prayer. While thus engaged a vision fell upon him. Sud denly he was seized by some supernatural power of evil import, which bound him body and soul. He could not think; he could not speak; thick darkness gathered round. Presently there appeared above his head a pillar of light, which slowly descended and enveloped him. Immediately he was delivered from the enemy; and in the sky he saw two bright person ages, one of whom said, pointing to the other, \" This is my beloved son; hear him.\" Then he asked what he should do; to which sect he should unite himself. stitious, having a firm belief in ghosts and witches; the telling of fortunes; pretending to believe that the earth was filled with hidden treasures, buried there by Kid or the Spaniards. Being miserably poor, and not much dis posed to obtain an honest livelihood by labor, the energies of their minds seemed to be mostly directed toward finding where these treasures were con cealed, and the best mode of acquiring their possession.' Howe's Mormonism Unveiled, 11. In the towns of Palmyra and Manchester, in 1833, documents defamatory to the family were circulated for signature, one receiving 11 and another 51 names. Given with signatures in Howe's Mormonism Unveiled, 261-2, and in Kidder's Mormonism, 20-1. See also Olshausen, Gesch. d. Morm., 9-14, 103-10, 200-1; Gazette of Utah, 1874, 17; Tucker's Origin and Prog. Mor., 11-20. In one of these documents, signed and sworn to by Peter Ingersoll, he said that the Smith family employed most of their time in gold digging. At one time Joseph Smith senior told Ingersoll to hold a mineral rod in his hand, a piece of witch-hazel, and selected a place to stand where he was to whisper directions to the rod; Smith stood apart, throwing himself into various shapes, but was unable to produce the desired effect. Again he took a stone that Ingersoll had picked up and exclaimed that it was invalu able; looking at it earnestly, he said it revealed to him chests of gold and silver at the back of his house; and putting it into his hat, threw himself into various attitudes, and soon appeared exhausted; then in a faint voice, said, 'If you only knew what I had seen you would believe.' Some time be fore Joseph's discovery of the gold plates, the elder Smith told Ingersoll that a book had been found in Canada in a hollow tree which treated of the discovery of this continent:"], [96, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 42 And he was told to join none of them, that all were corrupt, all were abomination in the eyes of the Lord. When he came to himself he was still gazing earnestly up into heaven. This was in the spring of L820, and Joseph was yet scarcely fifteen. When the young prophet began to proclaim his vision, the wise men and preachers of the several sects laughed at him; called him a silly boy, and told him that if his mind had really been disturbed, it was the devil's doing. \" Signs and revelations,\" said they, \"are of by-gone times; it ill befits one so young to lie before God and in the presence of his people.\" \"Nevertheless,\" replied Joseph, \"I have hadavision.\" Then they reviled him, and the boy became disheart ened and was entangled again in the vanities of the world, under the heavy hand of their oppression. But the spirit of the Lord could not thus be quenched. The young man repented, and sought and found forgiveness. Retiring to his bed, midst prayer and supplication, on the night of September 21, 1823, presently the room grew light, and a figure robed in exceeding whiteness stood by the bedside, the feet not touching the floor. And a voice was heard, say ing, \" I am Moroni, and am come to you, Joseph, as a messenger from God.\" Then the angel told the youth that the Lord had for him a great work to do, that his name should be known to all people, and of him should be spoken both good and evil. He told him of a book written on plates of gold, and containing an account of the early inhabitants of this continent, and the gospel as delivered to them by Christ. He said that deposited with those plates were two stones in silver bows, which, fastened to a breastplate, constituted the Urim and Thummim ; and that now as in ancient times the possession and use of the stones constituted a seer, and that through them the book might be translated. After offering many scriptural quotations from both the old and the new testament, and charging the young man that when the book and the breastplate were de-"], [97, "THE PLATES. 43 livered to him he should show them to no one, under pain of death and destruction \u2014 the place where the plates were deposited meanwhile being clearly re vealed to his mental vision \u2014 the light in the room grew dim, as Moroni ascended along a pathway of glory into heaven, and finally darkness was there as before. The visit was made three times, the last ending with the dawn, when Joseph arose greatly ex hausted and went into the field to work. His father, observing his condition, sent him home ; but on the way Joseph fell in a state of unconscious ness to the ground. Soon, however, the voice of Moroni was heard, commanding him to return to his father, and tell him all that he had seen and heard. The young man obeyed. The father answered that it was of God; the son should do as the messenger had said. Then Joseph, knowing from the vision where the plates were hidden, went to the west side of a hill, called the hill Cumorah, near the town of Manchester, and beneath a large stone, part of whose top appeared above the ground, in a stone box,2 he found the plates,3 the urim and thum- 2 Oliver Cowdery stated that he visited the spot, and that 'at the bottom of this [hole] lay a stone of suitable size, the upper surface being smooth. At each edge was placed a large quantity of cement, and into this cement at the four edges of this stone were placed erect four others, their lower edges resting in the cement at the outer edges of the first stone. The four last named when placed erect formed a box, the corners, or where the edges of the four came in contact, were also cemented so firmly that the moisture from without was prevented from entering. It is to be observed also that the inner surfaces of the four erect or side stones were smooth. The box was sufficiently large to admit a breastplate. From the bottom of the box or from the breastplate arose three small pillars, composed of the same de scription of cement as that used on the edges; and upon these three pillars were placed the records. The box containing the records was covered with another stone, the lower surface being fiat and the upper crowning. Mackay s The Mormons, 20. _, , 'Orson Pratt thus describes the plates, Visions, 14: 'These records were engraved on plates, which had the appearance of gold. Each plate was not far from seven by eight inches in width and length, being not quite as thick as common tin. They were silled on both sides with engravings in Egyptian characters, and bound together iu a volume, as the leaves ot a book, and fast ened at one edge with three rings running through the whole This volume was about six inches in thickness, and a part of it vyas scaled she char acters or letters upon the unsealed part were small and beautifully engraved The whole book exhibited many marks of antiquity in its construction, as well"], [98, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 44 mim,4 and the breastplate.5 But when he was about to take them out Moroni stood beside him and said, \"Not yet; meet me here at this time eacli year for four years, and I will tell you what to do.\" Joseph obeyed. The elder Smith was poor, and the boys were some- times obliged to hire themselves out as laborers. It was on the 22d of September, 1823, that the plates were found. The following year Alvin died, and in October 1825 Joseph went to work for Josiah Stoal, in Chenango county. This man had what he sup posed to be a silver mine at Harmony, Pennsylvania, said to have been once worked by Spaniards. Thither Joseph went with the other men to dig for silver,6 as much skill in the art of engraving. ' In the introduction to the Book of Mor- mon (New York ed.), viii., is given essentially the same description.

And yet the ten commandments are to-day accepted. 4 'With the book were found the urim and thummim, two transparent crystals set in the rims of a bow. These pebbles were the seer's instru- ment whereby the mystery of hidden things was to be revealed!' Intro- duction to Book of Mormon (New York ed.), viii. 'The best attainable defi- nition of the ancient urim and thummim is quite vague and indistinct. An accepted biblical lexicographer gives the meaning as \"light and perfection,\" or the \"shining mid the perfect.\" The following is quotedfrom Bulterworth's Concordance: \"There are various conjectures about the urim and thummim, whether they were the stones in the high-priest's breastplate, or something distinct from them; which it is not worth our while to inquire iuto, since God has left it a secret. It is evident that the urim and thummim were appointed to inquire of God by, on momentous occasions, and continued in use as some think, only till the building of Solomon's temple, and all con- clude that this was never restored after its destruction.'\" Tucker's Oriain and Prog. Mor., 32. 3 'A breastplate such as was used by the ancients to defend the chest from the arrows and weapons of their enemy.' Mackay's The Mormons, 20. 6 ' Hence arose the very prevalent story of my having been a money digger ' Hist. Joseph Smith, in Times and Seasons, May 2, 1842. It seems from this or some other cause, that the followers of Smith have never regarded mining with favor although some of them at times have engaged in that occupation. Upon the discovery of gold in California, the Mormons were among the first in the field, at Coloma, at Mormon Bar, and elsewhere. Left there a little longer, they would soon have gathered barrels of the precious dust- but promptly upon the call they dropped their tools, abandoned their brilliant prospects, and crossing the Sierra, began to build homes among their peonle in the untenanted desert."], [99, "JOSEPH'S MARRIAGE. 45 boarding at the house of Isaac Hale. After a month's fruitless effort Stoal was induced by Joseph to aban don the undertaking; but meanwhile the youth had fallen in love with Hale's pretty daughter, Emma, and wished to marry her. Hale objected, owing to his continued assertions that he had seen visions, and the resulting persecutions; so Joseph took Emma to the house of Squire Tarbill, at South Bainbridge, where they were married the 18th of January, 1827, and thence returned to his father's farm, where he worked during the following season.7 Every year went Joseph to the hill Cumorah to hold communion with the heavenly messenger, and on the 22d of September, 1827, Moroni delivered to him the plates,8 and the urim and thummim with which to translate them, charging him on pain of dire dis- 7 Among the many charges of wrong-doing ascribed to Smith from first to last, was that of having stolen Hale's daughter. In answer it is said that the young woman was of age, and had the right to marry whom and as she chose. 8 'When the appointed hour came, the prophet, assuming his practised air of mystery, took in hand his money-digging spade and a large napkin, and went off iu silence and alone in the solitude of the forest, and after an absence of some three hours, returned, apparently with his sacred charge con cealed within the folds of the napkin. Reminding the (Smith) family of the original \"command\" as revealed to him, strict injunction of non-intervention and non-inspection was given to them, under the same terrible penalty as be fore denounced for its violation. Conflicting stories were afterwards told in regard to the manner of keeping the book in concealment and\" safety, which are not worth repeating, further than to mention that the first place of secre tion was said to be under a heavy hearthstone in the Smith family mansion. Smith told a frightful story of the display of celestial pyrotechnics on the ex posure to his view of the sacred book \u2014 the angel who had led him to the dis covery again appearing as his guide and protector, and confronting ten thou sand devils gathered there, with their menacing sulphurous flame and smoke, to deter him from his purpose ! This story was repeated and magnified by the believers, and no doubt aided the experiment upon superstitious minds which eventuated so successfully.' Tucker's Orig. and Prog. Mor., 30-31. 'A great variety of contradictory stories were related by the Smith family before they had any fixed plan of operation, respecting the finding of the plates from which their book was translated. One is, that after the plates were taken from their hiding-place by Jo, he again laid them down, looked into the hole, where he saw a toad, which immediately transformed itself into a spirit and gave him a tremendous blow. Another is, that after he had got the plates, a spirit assaulted him with the intention of getting them from his possession, and actually jerked them out of his hands. Jo, nothing daunted, seized them again, and started to run, when his Satanic majesty, or the spirit applied his foot to the prophet's seat of honor which raised three or four feet from the ground.'

Persecutions increased when it was known that Joseph had in his possession the plates of gold, and every art that Satan could devise or put in force through the agency of wicked men was employed to aggeration. It had a substantial door of two-inch plank, and a secure lock. Lapse of time and other causes have almost effaced its existence. Tucker's Origin and Prog. Mor., 48. 'In 1843, near Kinderhook, Illinois, in exca- vating a large mound, six brass plates were discovered of a bell-shape four inches in length and covered with ancient characters. They were fastened together with two iron wires almost entirely corroded, and were found along with charcoal, ashes, and human bones, more than twelve feet below the surface of a mound of the sugar-loaf form, common in the Mississippi Valley. Large trees growing upon these artificial mounds attest their great antiquity ... No key has yet been discovered for the interpretation of the engravings upon these brass plates, or of the strange gylphs upon the ruins of Otolum iu Mexico.'

On the authority of Kidder, Mormonism, 23-6, Willard Chase, a carpenter, said: 'In the fore part of September (I believe) 1827, the prophet requested me to make him a chest, informing me that he designed to move back to Pennsylvania, and ex- pecting soon to get his gold book, he wanted a chest to lock it up, giving me to understand, at the same time, that if I would make the chest he would give me a share in the book. I told him my business was such that I could not make it; but if he would bring the book to me, I would lock it up for him. He said that would not do, as he was commanded to keep it two years without letting it come to the eye of any one but himself. This command- ment, however, he did not keep, for in less than two years twelve men said they had seen it. I told him to get it and convince me of its existence, and I would make him a chest; but be said that would not do; as he must have a chest to lock the book in as soon as he took it out of the ground. I saw him a sews days after, when he told me I must make the chest. I told him plainly that I could not, upon which he told me that I could have no share in the book. A few weeks after this conversation he came to my house and related the following story: That on the 22d of September he arose early in the morning and took a one-horse wagon of some one that had stayed over night at their house without leave or license; and, together with his wife, repaired to the hill which contained the book. He left his wife iu the wagon, by the road and went alone to the hill, a distance of thirty or forty rods from the road- he said he then took the book out of the ground and hid it in a tree-top and returned home. He then went to the town of Macedon to work After about ten days, it having been suggested that some one-had got his book, his wile went after him; he hired a horse, and went home in the afternoon stayed long enough to drink one cup of tea, and then went for his book, found it safe, took off his frock, wrapt it round it, put it under his arm, and ran all the way home, a distance of about two miles. He said he should think it would weigh sixty pounds, and was sure it would weigh forty. On his return home he said he was attacked by two men in the woods, and knocked them both down and made his escape, arrived safe, and secured his treasure He then observed that it it had not been for that stone (which he acknowledged belonged to me) he would not have obtained the book. A few days after ward he told one of my neighbors that he had not got any such book, and never had; but that he told the story to deceive the damned fool (meaning me), to get him to make a chest.'

He had not gone far before he was overtaken by an officer with a search-war rant, who flattered himself with the idea that he should surely obtain the plates; after searching very diligently, he was sadly disappointed at not find ing them. Mr Smith then drove on, but before he got to his journey's end he was again overtaken by an officer on the same business, and after ransack ing the wagon very carefully, he went his way as much chagrined as the first at not being able to discover the object of his research. Without any fur ther molestation, he pursued his journey until he came to the northern part of Pennsylvania, near the Susquehanna River, in which part his father-in law resided. ' Pratt 's Visions, 15. 10 ' In the neighborhood (of Smith's old home) there lived a farmer possessed of some money and more credulity. Every wind of doctrine affected him. He had been in turn a quaker, a Wesleyan, a baptist, a presbyterian. His heterogeneous and unsettled views admirably qualified him for discipleship where novelty was paramount, and concrete things were invested with the enchantment of mystery. He was enraptured with the young prophet, and offered him fifty dollars to aid in the publication of his new bible.' Taylder's Mormons, xxviii.-ix. 11 'Soon after Smith's arrival at Harmony, Isaac Hale (Smith's father-in law) heard he had brought a wonderful box of plates with him. Hale \"was shown a box in which it is said they were contained, which had to all ap pearances been used as a glass box of the common window-glass. I was allowed to feel the weight of the box, and they gave me to understand that the book of plates was then in the box\u2014 into which, however, I was not al lowed to look. I inquired of Joseph Smith, Jr., who was to be the first who would be allowed to see the book of plates. He said it was a young child. After this I became dissatisfied, and informed him that if there was any thing in my house of that description, which I could not be allowed to see he must take it away; if he did not, I was determined to see it.

Harris' wife is ex ceedingly curious about the matter, and finally obtains possession through her husband of a portion of the manuscript.13 About this time Harris takes a copy n Martin Harris 'says he wrote a considerable part of the book as Smith dictated; and at one time the presence of the Lord was so great that a screen was hung up between him and the prophet; at other times the prophet would sit in a different room, or up stairs, while the Lord was communicating to him the contents of the plates. He does not pretend that he ever saw the won- derful plates but once, although he and Smith were engaged for months in deciphering their contents.' Mormonism Unveiled, 14. 'Harris rendered Smith valuable assistance by transcribing for him, since he could not write himself. Poor Martin was unfortunately gifted with a troublesome wife. Her inquisitive and domineering nature made him dread unpleasant results from his present engagement. His manuscript had reached 116 pages, and he therefore begged permission to read it to her ' ' with the hope that it might have a salutary effect upon her feelings. \" His request was at length granted; but through carelessness or perfidy, while in his house, the precious docu- ment was irrecoverably lost. Joseph suffered greatly in consequence of this hinderance, but more from the anger of heaven which was manifested against him. As soon as possible, he resumed his task, having secured the services of another scribe, Oliver Cowdery, a school-master in the neighborhood. Martin Harris, earnest as he was, had never yet been favored with a si<*ht of the golden plates. He had not attained to sufficient purity of mind; but a copy of a small portion of their contents was placed in his hands, and this he was told he might show to any scholar in the world, if he wished to be sat- isfied. Accordingly he started for New York, sought Professor Anthon (Charles Anthon, LL.D., then adjunct professor of ancient languages in Colum- bia College), and requested his opinion.' Taylder's Mormons, xxxviii.-ix. 'She (Harris's wife) contrived in her husband's sleep to steal from him the particular source of her disturbance, and burned the manuscript to ashes. lor years she kept this incendiarism a profound secret to herself, even until after the book was published. Smith and Harris held her accountable for the theft, but supposed she had handed the manuscript to some \"evil-desicmin\" persons, ' to be used somehow in injuring their cause. A feud was thus pro\u00b0 duced between husband and wife which was never reconciled. Great con- sternation now pervaded the Mormon circles. The reappearance of the myste- rious stranger (who had before visited the Smiths) was again the subject of \"W?1? an<l conjecture by observers, from whom was withheld all explanation ot his identity or purpose. It was not at first an easy task to convince the prophet of the entire innoeency of his trusted friend Harris in the matter of this calamitous event, though mutual confidence and friendship were ultimately restored.

Of this lost manuscript Smith afterward wrote: 'Some tune after Mr Harris had begun to write for me he began to tease me to give him liberty to carry the writings home and show them and desired of me that I would inquire of the Lord through the urim and tnummim if he might not do so. ' To two inquiries the reply was no, but a third application resulted in permission being granted under certain re- strictions which were, that Harris might show the papers to his brother his wife, her sister, his father and mother, and to no one else. Accordingly Smith required Harris to bind himself in a covenant to him iu the most solemn manner that he would not do otherwise than had been directed ' He"], [103, "WORK OF TRANSLATION. 49 of some of the characters to New York city, where he submits them to the examination of Professor Anthon and Dr Mitchell, who pronounce them to be Egyptian, Syriac, Chaldaic, and Arabic.13 Then did so,' says Smith. 'He bound himself as I required ol him, took the writings, and went his way. Notwithstanding. . .he did show them to others, and by stratagem they got them away from him. ' Smith, in Times and Sea sons, iii. 785-6. 13 In a letter to E. D. Howe, printed in his book, and in the introduction to the New York edition of the Book of Mormon, Prof. Anthon, among other statements, denies that he ever gave a certificate. The letter reads as follows: 'New York, February 17, 1834. ' Deak Sir: I received your letter of the 9th, and lose no time in making a reply. The whole story about my pronouncing the Mormon inscription to be reformed Egyptian hierogylphics is perfectly false. Some years ago, a plain, apparently simple-hearted farmer called on- me with a note from Dr Mitchell, of our city, now dead, requesting me to decipher, if possible, the paper which the farmer would hand me. Upon examining the paper in ques tion, I soon came to the conclusion that it was all a trick \u2014 perhaps a hoax. When I asked the person who brought it how he obtained the writing, he gave me the following account: A gold book consisting of a number of plates, fast ened together by wires of the same material, had been dug up in the northern part of the state of New York, and along with it an enormous pair of specta cles. These spectacles were so large that if any person attempted to look through them, his two eyes would look through one glass only, the spectacles iu question being altogether too large for the human face. \"Whoever,\" he said, \" examined the plates through the glasses was enabled not only to read them, but fully to understand their meaning.\" All this knowledge, however was confined to a young man, who had the trunk containing the book and specta cles in his sole possession. This young man was placed behind a curtain in a garret in a farm-house, and being thus concealed from view, he put on the spectacles occasionally, or rather looked through one of the glasses, deciphered the characters in the book, and having committed some. of them to paper, handed copies from behind the curtain to those who stood outside. Not a word was said about their beiug deciphered by tho gift of God. Everything in this way was effected by the large pair of spectacles. The farmer added that he had been requested to contribute a sum of money toward the publica tion of the golden book, the contents of which would, as he was told, produce an entire change in the world, aud save it from ruin. So urgent had been these solicitations, that he intended selling his farm and giving the amount to those who wished to publish the plates. As a last precautionary step, he had resolved to come to New York, aud obtain the opinion of the learned about the meaning of the paper which he brought with him, and which had been given him as part of the contents of the book, although no translation had at that time beeu made by the young man with spectacles. On hearing this odd story, I changed my opinion about the paper, and instead of viewing it any longer as a hoax, I began to regard it as part of a scheme to cheat the farmer of his money, and I communicated my suspicions to him, warning him to be ware of rogues. He requested an opinion from me in writing, which, of course, I declined to give, and he then took his leave, taking his paper with him This paper in question was, in fact, a singular scroll. It consisted ot all kinds of singular characters disposed in columns, and had evidently been menared by some person who had before him at the time a book containing various alphabets, Greek and Hebrew letters, crosses and flourishes; Roman letters inverted or placed sideways were arranged and placed in perpendicular columns and the whole ended in a rude delineation of a circle, divided into Hist.

In February 1829 he receives a visit from his own father, at which time a revelation comds to Joseph Smith senior, through the son, calling him to faith and good works. The month following Mar tin Harris asks for and receives a revelation, by the mouth of the latter, regarding the plates, wherein the said Harris is told that Joseph has in his possession the plates which he claims to have, that they were delivered to him by the Lord God, who likewise gave him power to translate them, and that he, Harris, should bear witness of the same. Three months later, Harris having meanwhile acted as his scribe, Joseph is commanded to rest for a season in his work of translating until directed to take it up again. various compartments, arched with various strange marks, and evidently copied after the Mexican calendar given by Humboldt, but copied in such a way as not to betray the source whence it was derived. I am thus particular as to the contents of the paper, inasmuch as I have frequently conversed with friends on the subject since the Mormon excitement began, and well remem- ber that the paper contained anything else but Egyptian hieroglyphics. Some time after, the farmer paid me a second visit. He brought with him the gold book in print, and offered it to me for sale. I declined purchasing. He then asked permission to leave the book with me for examination. I declined re- ceiving it, although his manner was strangely urgent. I adverted once more to the roguery which, in my opinion, had been practised upon him, and asked him what had become of the gold plates. He informed me they were in a trunk with the spectacles. I advised him to go to a magistrate and have the trunk examined. He said the curse of God would come upon him if he did. On my pressing him, however, to go to a magistrate, he told me he would open the trunk if I would take the curse of God upon myself. I replied I would do so with the greatest willingness, and would incur every risk of that nature, provided I could only extricate him from the grasp of the rogues. He then left me. I have given you a full statement of all that I know respecting the origin i.l Mormonism, and must beg of you, as a personal favor, to publish this letter immediately, should you find my name mentioned again by these wretched fanatics. Yours respectfully, 'Charles Anthon.' It is but fair to state that Smith never claimed that the characters were the ordinary Greek or Hebrew, but were what he called Reformed Egyptian. Harris says: ' He gave me a certificate which I took and put into my pocket, and was just leaving the house when Mr Anthon called me back, and asked me how the young man found out that there were gold plates in the place where he found them. I answered that an angel of God had revealed it unto him. He then said unto me, Let me see that certificate. I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him, when he took it aud tore it to pieces, saying that there was no such thing now as ministering of angels, and that if I would bring the plates to him he would translate them. I informed him that part of the plates were sealed, and that I was forbidden to bring them; he replied, \"I cannot read a sealed book.\" I left him and went to Dr Mit chell, who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting beth the characters aud the translation.'

Fifteen hundred years after, or six hundred years before Christ, they were destroyed for their wickedness. Of the original number was Jared, among whose descendants was the prophet Ether, who was their historian. Ether lived to witness the extinction of his nation, and under divine direction he deposited his history in a locality where it was found by a second colony, Israelites of the tribe of Joseph, who came from Jerusalem about the time of the de struction of the first colony, namely, six hundred years before Christ. Thus was America repeopled; the second colony occupied the site of the first, mul tiplied and became rich, and in time divided into two nations, the Nephites and the Lamanites, so called from their respective founders, Nephi and Laman. The former advanced in civilization, but the Laman ites lapsed into barbarism, and were the immediate progenitors of the American aboriginals. The Nephites were the beloved of the Lord. To them were given visions and angels' visits; to them the Christ appeared with gifts of gospel and prophecy. It was, indeed, the golden age of a favored people; but in a time of temptation, some three or four cen turies after Christ, they fell, and were destroyed by u ' The word \" Mormon,\" the name given to his book, is the English termi nation of the Greek word morinoo, which we find defined in an old, obsolete dictionary to mean bugbear, hobgoblin, raw head, and bloody bones.'

The greatest prophet of the Nephites, in the period of their declension, was Mor mon, their historian, who after having completed his abridgment of the records of his nation, committed it to his son Moroni, and he, that they might not fall into the hands of the Lamanites, deposited them in the hill of Cumorah, where they were found by Joseph Smith. On the 5th of April, 1829, there comes to Joseph Smith a school-teacher, Oliver Cowdery by name, to whom the Lord had revealed himself at the house of the elder Smith, where the teacher had been boarding. Inquiring of the Lord, Joseph is told that to Oliver shall be given the same power to translate the book of Mormon,15 by which term the writing on 15 The Book of Mormon; an account written by The Hand of Mormon, upon plates taken from the plates of Nephi.

Richards, en titled The Book of Mormon, I epitomize as follows: Several families retain ing similar forms of speech were directed by God to America, where they became numerous and prosperous. They lived righteously at first, but after ward became sinful, and about 600 B. c. broke up as a nation, leaving records by their most eminent historian Ether. During the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, two men, Lehi and Mulek, were warned of God of the approaching destruction of Jerusalem, and were directed how they and their families could make their escape, and were led to this land where they found the records of the former people. Lehi landed at Chili. His people spread to North America, became numerous and wealthy, lived under the law of Moses which they had brought with them, and had their judges, kings, prophets, and temples. Looking confidently for the coming of Christ in the flesh, in due time he came, and after his crucifixion organized the church in America as he had done in Judea, an account of which, together with their general history, was preserved on metallic plates in the language of the times. An abridgment was made on gold plates about A. d. 400 by a prophet named Mormon, from all the historical plates that had come down to him. Thus were given not only the histories of the Nephites and Lamanites \u2014 his own people \u2014 but of the Jaredites, who had occupied the land before them, and his book was called the Book of Mormon. Destruction coming upon the people, Mormon's son, Moroni, was directed of God where to deposit the plates, the urim and thummim being deposited with them so that the finder might be able to read them. And as Moroni had left them so were they found by Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon was translated in 1851 into Italian, under the auspices of Lorenzo Snow, and into Danish under the direction of Erastus Snow; in 1852 John Taylor directed its translation into French and German, and Franklin D. Richards into Welsh. In 1855 George Q. Cannon brought out an edition in the Hawaiian language at San Francisco; in 1878 N. C. Flygare supervised its publication in the Swedish, and Moses Thatcher in 1884 in the Spanish language. In December 1874, Orson Pratt, at that time church historian, prepared an article for insertion in the Universal Cyclopedia, a portion of which is as follows: 'The first edition of this wonderful book was published early in 1830. It has since been translated and published in the Welsh, Danish, German, French, and Italian languages of the east, and in the language of the Sandwich Islands of the west. It is a volume about one third as large as the bible, consisting of sixteen sacred books . . . One of the founders of the Jaredite nation, a great prophet, saw in vision all things from the foundation of the world to the end thereof, which were written, a copy of which was en graved by Moroni on the plates of Mormon, and then sealed up. It was this portion which the prophet, Joseph Smith, was forbidden to translate or to unloose the seal. In due time this also will be revealed, together with all the sacred records kept by the ancient nations of this continent, preparatory to the time when the knowledge of God shall cover the earth as the waters cover the great deep.'

He was one of the many in the world who always find time to study out ways and means to live without work. He accordingly quit the blacksmithing business, and is now the editor of a small monthly publication issued under the directions of the prophet, and principally filled with accounts of the spread of Mormonism, their persecutions, and the fabled visions and commands of Smith.' He was 'chief scribe to the prophet, while transcribing, after Martin had lost 116 pages of the precious document by interference of the devil. An angel also has shown him the plates from which the book of Mormon proceeded, as he says.' Howe's Mormonism Unveiled, 15, 265; see also Pearl of Great Price, xiii. 54; Smucker's Hist.

This he placed in a hat, or box, into which he also thrust. his face. . .Another account they give of the transaction is, that it was per formed with the big spectacles,' which enabled ' Smith to translate the plates without looking at them.'

In relation to the peep-stone al luded to, Williard Chase says in his sworn testimony that he discovered a singular stone while digging a well in the year 1822. Joseph Smith was as sisting him, and borrowed the stone from him, alleging that he could see into it. After he obtained the stone Smith published abroad the wonders that he could see in the stone, and made much disturbance among the credulous members of the community. See Howe's Mormonism Unveiled, 241. 'This stoue attracted particular notice on account of its peculiar shape, resembling that of a child's foot. It was of a whitish, glassy appearance, though opaque, resembling quartz ... He (Joseph Jr) manifested a special fancy for this geo logical curiosity; and he carried it home with him, though this act of plunder was against the strenuous protestations of Mr Chase's children, who claimed to be its rightful owners. Joseph kept this stone, and ever afterward refused its restoration to the claimants. Very soon the pretension transpired that he could see wonderful things by its aid. The idea was rapidly enlarged upon from day to day, and in a short time his spiritual endowment was so devel oped that he asserted the gift and power (with the stone at his eyes) of re vealing both things existing and things to come.'

Continuing thus, on the 15th of May the two men go into the woods to ask God concerning baptism, found mentioned in the plates. Presently a messenger-de scends from heaven in a cloud of light. It is John the Baptist. And he ordains them, saying, \"Upon yoti, my fellow-servants, in the name of messiah, I confer the priesthood of Aaron.\" Baptism by immersion is directed; the power of laying-on of hands for the gift of the holy ghost is promised, but not now bestowed; then they are commanded to be baptized, each one baptizing the other, which is done, each in turn lay ing his hands upon the head of the other, and ordain ing him to the Aaronic priesthood. As they come up out of the water the holy ghost falls upon them, and they prophesy. Persecutions continue; brethren of Christ threaten to mob them, but Joseph's wife's father promises protection. Samuel Smith comes, and is converted, receiving baptism and obtaining revelations ; and later Joseph's father and mother, Martin Harris, and others. Food is several times charitably brought to the translators by Joseph Knight, senior, of Coles ville, New York, concerning whom is given a revela tion. In June comes David Whitmer with a request from his father, Peter Whitmer, of Fayette, New York, that the translators should occupy his house thenceforth until the completion of their work, and brings with him a two-horse wagon to carry them and their effects. Not only is their board to be free, but one of the brothers Whitmer, of whom there are David, John, and Peter junior, will assist in the writ ing.

Three special witnesses are provided by Christ, namely, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris,18 to whom the plates are shown by an angel after much prayer and meditation in the woods. These are the three witnesses. And there are further eight wit nesses, namely, Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer junior, John Whitmer, Hiram Page, Joseph Smith senior, Hyrum Smith, and Samuel H. Smith, who testify that the plates were shown to them by Joseph Smith junior, that they handled them with their hands, and saw the characters engraven thereon.19 18 The objections raised against this testimony are, first, there is no date nor place; second, there arc not three separate affidavits, but one testimony signed by three men; third, compare with Smith's revelation Doctrine and Covenants, p. 173, and it appears that this testimony is drawn up by Smith himself. But who are these witnesses ? Sidney Rigdon, at Independence, Missouri, in 1838, charged Cowdery and Whitmer with 'being connected with a gang of counterfeiters, thieves, liars, blacklegs of the deepest dye, to de- ceive and defraud the saints.' Joseph Smith (Times and Seasons, vol. i. pp. 81, 83-4) charges Cowdery and Whitmer with being busy in stirring up strife and turmoil among the brethren in 1838 in Missouri; and he demands, 'Are they not murderers then at the heart ? Are not their consciences seared as with a hot iron?' These men were consequently cut off from the church. In 1837 Smith prints this language about his coadjutor and witness: 'There are negroes who have white skins as well as black ones \u2014 Granny Parish and others, who acted as lackeys, such as Martin Harris ! But they are so far beneath my contempt that to notice any of them would be too great a sacrifice for a gentleman to make.' Hyde's Mormonism, 252-5. Of David Whitmer, Mr Howe says: 'He is one of five of the same name and family who have been used as witnesses to establish the imposition, and who are now head men and loaders in the Mormonite camp. They were noted in their neighborhood for credulity and a general belief in witches, and perhaps were fit subjects for the juggling arts of Smith. David relates that he was led by Smith into an open field, on his father's farm, where they found the book of plates lying upon the ground. Smith Jook it up and requested him to examine it, which he did for the space of half an hour or more, when he returned it to Smith, who placed it in its former position, alleging that it was in the custody of an angel. He describes the plates as being about eight inches square, the leaves being metal of a whitish yellow color, and of the thickness of tin plates.' Mormonism Unveiled, 16.

The Smiths were the father and broth ers of Joseph. Who the Whitmers were is not clear, and all clew to their character and proceedings since this date, though probably known to the Mormons themselves, is undiscoverable by the profane vulgar. ' Mackay's The Mormons, 23. mormons, The theory commonly accepted at present by those not of the Mormon faith, in regard to the origin of the book of Mormon, is thus given in the in-"], [114, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 60 troduction to the New York edition of the Book of Mormon, essentially the same as that advanced previously by E. D. Howe, and subsequently elabo rated by others: 'About the year 1809, the Rev. Solomon Spaulding, a clergy man who had graduated from Dartmouth college, and settled in the town of Cherry Valley, in the State of New York, removed from that place to New Salem (Conneaut), Ashtabula county, Ohio. Mr Spaulding was an enthu siastic arch\u00e6ologist. The region to which he removed was rich in American antiquities. The mounds and fortifications which have puzzled the brains of many patient explorers attracted his attention, and he accepted the theory that the American continent was peopled by a colony of the ancient Israelites. The ample material by which he was surrounded, full of mythical interest and legendary suggestiveness, led him to the conception of a curious literary pro ject. He set himself the task of writing a fictitious history of the race which had built the mounds. The work was commenced and progressed slowly for some time. Portions of it were read by Mr Spaulding's friends, as its dif ferent sections were completed, and after three years' labor, the volume was sent to the press, bearing the title of The Manuscript Found. Mr Spauldirig had removed to Pittsburgh, Pa., before his book received the final revision, and it was in the hands of a printer named Patterson, in that city, that the manuscript was placed with a view to publication. This was in the year 1812. The printing, however, was delayed in consequence of a difficulty about the contract, until Mr Spaulding left Pittsburgh, and went to Amity, Washington county, New York, where in 1810 he died. The manuscript seems to have lain unused during this interval. But in the employ of the printer Patterson was a versatile genius, one Sidney Rigdon, to whom no trade came amiss, and who happened at the time to be a journeyman at work with Patterson. Disputations on questions of theology were the peculiar de light of Rigdon, and the probable solution of the mystery of the book of Mor mon is found in the fact that, by this man's agency, information of the exist ence of the fictitious record was first communicated to Joseph Smith. Smith's family settled in Palmyra, New York, about the year 1815, and re moved subsequently to Ontario county, where Joseph became noted for su preme cunning and general shiftlessness. Chance threw him in the company of Rigdon soon after Spaulding's manuscript fell under the eye of the erratic journeyman, and it is probable that the plan of founding a new system of re ligious imposture was concocted by these two shrewd and unscrupulous par ties. The fact that the style of the book of Mormon so closely imitates that of the received version of the bible \u2014 a point which seems to have been con stantly kept in view by Mr Spaulding, probably in order to invest the fiction with a stronger character of reality \u2014 answered admirably for the purposes of Rigdon and Smith.' Mr Howe testifies that 'an opinion has prevailed to a considerable extent that Rigdon has been the Iago, the prime mover of the whole conspiracy. Of this, however, we have no positive proof.' Mor monism Unveiled, 100. To prove the foregoing, witnesses are brought forward. John Spaulding, brother of Solomon, testifies: 'He then told me that he had been writing a book, which he intended to have printed, the avails of which he thought would enable him to pay all his debts. The book was entitled The Manuscript Found, of which he read to me many passages. It was an historical romance of the first settlers of America,' etc. He goes on to speak of Nephi and Lehi as names familiar, as does also Martha Spaulding, John's wife. Hemy Lake, formerly Solomon's partner, testifies to the same effect; also John N. Miller, who worked for Lake and Spaulding in building their forge; also Aaron Wright, Oliver Smith, and Nahuin Howard, neighbors; also Artemas Cunning ham, to whom Spaulding owed money. To these men Solomon spaulding used to talk about and read from his Manuscript Found, which was an ac count of the ten lost tribes in America, which lie wanted to publish and with the profits pay his debts. After the book of Mormon was printed, and they saw it, or heard it read, they were sure it was the same as Spaulding's Manu script Found. Id., 278-87."], [115, "THE SPAULDING THEORY. 61 Who Wrote the Book of Mormon? is the title of a 4to pamphlet of 16 pages by Robert Patterson of Pittsburgh. Reprinted from the illustrated history of Washington county, Philadelphia, 1882. This Patterson is the son of printer Patterson, to whose office the Spaulding MS. is said to have I ieeii sent. Little new information is brought out by this inquisition. First he extracts passages from Howe's Mormonism Unveiled, quoting at second hand from Kidder's Mormonism ai.d the Mormons, in the absence of the orig inal, stating erroneously that Howe's book was first printed in 1835. I give elsewhere an epitome of the contents of Howe's work. Ballantyne in his Reply to a Tract, by T. Richards, What is Mormonism? wherein is advanced the Spaulding theory, asserts in answer that Spaulding's manuscript was not known to Smith or Rigdon until after the publication of the Book of Mor mon, and that the two were not the same, the latter being about three times larger than the former. 'Dr Hurlburt,' he says, 'and certain other noted enemies of this cause, having heard that such a manuscript existed, deter mined to publish it to the world in order to destroy the book of Mormon, but after examining it, found that it did not read as they expected, consequently declined its publication.' The Spaulding theory is advanced and supported by the following, in addition to the eight witnesses whose testimony was given by Howe in his Mormonism Unveiled. Mrs Matilda Spaulding Davidson, once wife of Solomon Spaulding, said to Eev. D. R. Austin, who had the statement printed in the Boston Recorder, May 1839, that Spaulding was in the habit of reading portions of his romance to his friends and neighbors. When John Spaulding heard read for the first time passages from the book of Mormon he 'recognized perfectly the work of his brother. He was amazed and af flicted that it should have been perverted to so wicked a purpose. His grief found vent in a flood of tears, and he arose on the spot and expressed to the meeting his sorrow and regret that the writings of his deceased brother should be used for a purpose so vile and shocking.' Statements to the same effect are given as coming from Mrs McKinstry, daughter of Spaulding, printed in Scribner's Monthly, August 1S80; W. H. Sabine, brother of Mrs Spaulding; Joseph Miller, whose statements were printed in the Pittsburgh Telegraph, Feb. 6, 1879; Redick McKee in the Washington Reporter, April 21, 1869; Rev. Abner Jackson in a communication to the Washington County Histori cal Society, printed in the Washington Reporter, Jan. 7, 1881, and others.

Robert Patterson, in his pamphlet entitled Who Wrote the Book of Mor mon? thus discusses the case of Sidney Rigdon: 'It was satisfactorily proven that Spaulding was the author of the book of Mormon; but how did Joseph Smith obtain a copy of it ? The theory hitherto most widely published,' says Patterson, 'and perhaps generally accepted, has been that Rigdon was a printer in Patterson's printing-office when the Spaulding manuscript was brought there in 1812-14, and that he either copied or purloined it. Having it thus in his possession, the use made of it was an after thought suggested by circumstances many years later. More recently another theory has been advanced, that Rigdon obtained possession cf the Spaulding manuscript dur ing his pastorate of the first baptist church or soon thereafter, 1822-4, with out any necessary impropriety on his part, but rather through the courtesy of some friend, in whose possession it remained unclaimed, and who regarded it as a literary curiosity. The friends of Rigdon, in response to the first charge, deny that he ever resided in Pittsburgh previous to 1822, or that he ever was a printer, and in general answer to both charges affirm that he never at any time had access to Spaulding's manuscript. ' Rigdon denies em phatically that he ever worked in Patterson's printing-office or knew of such an establishment; and the testimony, produced by Patterson, of Carvil Rig don, Sidney's brother, Peter Boyer, his brother-in-law, Isaac King, Samuel Cooper, Robert Dubois, and Mrs Lambdin points in the same direction. On"], [116, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 62 the other hand, Mrs Davidson, Joseph Miller, Redick McKee, Rev. Cephas Dodd, and Mrs Eichbaum are quite positive that either Rigdon worked in the printing-office, or had access to the manuscript. ' These witnesses, continues Patterson, 'arc all whom we ca-n find, after inquires extending through some three years, who can testify at all to Rigdon's r.,sidence in Pittsburgh before 1816, and to his possible employment in Patterson's printing-office or bindery. Of this employment none of them speak from personal knowledge, in mak ing inquiries among two or three score of the oldest residents of Pittsburgh and vicinity, those who had any opinion on the subject invariably, so tar as now remembered, repeated the story of Rigdon's employment in Pattersons office as if it were a well known and admitted fact; they could tell all about it but when pressed as to their personal knowledge of it or their authority for the conviction, they had none.' Nevertheless he concludes, 'after an im partial consideration of the preceding testimony, that Rigdon as early as 1823 certainly had possession of Spaulding's manuscript; how he obtained it is unimportant for the present purpose; that during his career as a minister of the Disciples church in Ohio, he carefully preserved under lock and key this document, and devoted an absorbed attention to it; that he was aware of the forthcoming book of Mormon and of its contents long before its appearance; that the said contents were largely Spaulding's romance, and partly such modifications as Rigdon had introduced; and that, during the preparation of the book of Mormon, Rigdon had repeated and long interviews with Smith, thus easily supplying him with fresh instalments of the pretended revelation.' In a letter to the editors of the Boston Journal, dated May 27, 1S39, Rigdon says: ' There was no man by the name of Patterson during my residence at Pittsburgh who had a printing-office; what might have been before I lived there I know not. Mr Robert Patterson, I was told, had owned a printing office before I lived in that city, but had been unfortunate in business, and failed before my residence there. This Mr Patterson, who was a presbyterian preacher, I had a very slight acquaintance with during my residence in Pitts burgh. He was then acting under an agency in the book and stationery business, and was the owner of no property of any kind, printing-office or anything else, during the time I resided in the city.

Hut bert, the originator of the same; and some testimony adduced, showing it to be a sheer fabrication so far as its connection with the Book of Mormon is concerned. By B. Winchester, minister .of the. Gospel. The author goes on to say that Hulbert, a methodist preacher at Jamestown, N. Y., joined the Mormons in 1833, and was expelled for immoral conduct, whereupon he swore vengeance and concocted the Spaulding story. Hearing of a work written by Solomon Spaulding entitled The Manuscript Found, he sought to prove to those about him that the book of Mormon was derived from it, ' not that any of these persons had the most distant idea that this novel had ever been converted into the book of Mormon, or that there was any connection between them. Indeed, Mr Jackson, who had read both the book of Mormon and Spaulding's manuscript, told Mr H. when he came to get his signature to a writing testi fying to the probability that Mr S.'s manuscript had been converted into the book of Mormon, that there was no agreement between them; for, said he, Mr S.'s manuscript was a very small work, in the form of a novel, saying not one word about the children of Israel, but professed to give an account of a race of people who originated from the Romans, which Mr S. said he had translated from a Latin parchment that he had found.

Rigdon's connection, or rather lack of connection with the manu script is next discussed. Then is answered an article in Scribner's Magazine by Mrs Dickenson, grand niece of Mr Spaulding, and probably the most shal low treatment of the subject yet presented on either side. Further discus sions on the book are followed by an analysis of the life of Joseph, and finally internal evidences and prophecies are considered. 'It is evident,' Mr Rey nolds concludes, ' that if Mr Spaulding's story was what its friends claim, then it never could have formed the ground-work of the book of Mormon; for the 'whole historical narrative is different from beginning to end. And further, the story that certain old inhabitants of New Salem, who, it is said, recognized the book of Mormon, either never made such a statement, or they let their imagination run away with their memory into the endorsement of a falsehood and an impossibility.' 20 Speaking of Martin Harris, E. D. Howe says: 'Before his acquaintance with the Smith family he was considered an honest, industrious citizen by bis neighbors. His residence was in the town of Palmyra, where he had accumulated a handsome property. He was naturally of a very visionary turn of mind on the subject of religion, holding one sentiment but a short time.' Mortgaged his farm for $3,000, and printed the Book of Mormon, as he said, to make money. The price first was $1.75, then $1.25, afterward whatever they could get. ' Since that time the frequent demands on Mar tin's purse have reduced it to a very low state. He seems to have been the soul and body of the whole imposition, and now carries the most incon testable proofs of a religious maniac . . . Martin is an exceedingly fast talker. He frequently gathers a crowd around in bar-rooms and in the streets. Here he appears to be in his element, answering and explaining all manner of dark and abstruse theological questions . . . He is the source of much trouble and perplexity to the honest portion of his brethren, and would un doubtedly long since have been cast off by Smith were it not for his money, and the fact that he is one of the main pillars of the Mormon fabric. ' Mormonism Unveiled, 13-15. 'The wife of Martin Harris instituted a lawsuit against him [Joseph Smith, Jr], and stated in her affidavit that she believed the chief object he had in view was to defraud her husband of all his property. The trial took place at New York, and the facts, as related even by the mother of the prophet, are strongly condemnatory of his conduct. . .Harris denied in solemn terms that Smith had ever, in any manner, attempted to get pos session of his money, and ended by assuring the gentlemen of the court that, if they did not believe in the existence of the plates, and continued to resist the truth, it would one day be the means of damning their souls.'

'In the beginning of the printing the Mormons pro fessed to hold their manuscripts as sacred, and insisted upon maintaining con stant vigilance for their safety during the progress of the work, each morn ing carrying to the printing-office the instalment required for the day, and withdrawing the same at evening.

And now in a chamber of Whitmer's house Smith, Cowdery, and David Whitmer meet, and earnestly ask God to make good his promise, and confer on them the Melchisedec priesthood, which authorizes the lay ing-on of hands for the gift of the holy ghost. Their prayer is answered; for presently the word of the Lord comes to them, commanding that Joseph Smith should ordain Oliver Cowdery to be an elder in the church of Jesus Christ, and Oliver in like manner should so ordain Joseph, and the two should ordain others as from time to time the will of the Lord should be made known to them.21 But this ordination must not take place until the baptized brethren assemble and give to this act their sanction, and accept the ordained as spiritual teachers, and then only after the blessing and partaking of bread and wine. It is next revealed that twelve shall be called to be the disciples of Christ, the twelve apostles of these last days, who shall go into all the world preaching and baptizing. John H. Gilbert, as printer, had the chief operative trust of the type-setting and press-work of the job. After the first day's trial he found the manu scripts in so very imperfect a condition, especially in regard to grammar, that he became unwilling further to obey the \"command,\" and so announced to Smith and his party; when finally, upon much friendly expostulation, he was given a limited discretion in correcting, which was exercised in the par ticulars of syntax, orthography, punctuation, capitalizing, paragraphing, etc. Many errors under these heads, nevertheless, escaped correction, as appear in the first edition of tlie printed book. Very soon, too\u2014 after some ten days \u2014 the constant vigilance by the Mormons over the manuscripts was re laxed by reason of the confidence they came to repose in the printers. Mr Gilbert has now (1S67) in his possession a complete copy of the book in the original sheets, as laid off by him from the press in working. . .Meanwhile, Harris and his wife had separated by mutual arrangement, on account of her persistent unbelief in Mormonism and refusal to be a party to the mort gage.

The rise of the church of Jesus Christ in these last days is on the 6th of April, 1830, at which date the church was organized under the provisions of the statutes of the state of New York by Joseph Smith junior, Hyrum Smith, Oliver Cowdery, David Whit- mer, Samuel H. Smith, and Peter Whitmer. Joseph Smith, ordained an apostle of Jesus Christ, is made by the commandment of God the first elder of this church, and Oliver Cowdery, likewise an apostle, is made the second elder. Again the first elder falls into worldly entanglements, but upon repentance and self-humbling he is delivered by an angel. The duties of elders, priests, teachers, deacons, and members are as follow: All who desire it, with hon- esty and humility, may be baptized into the church; old covenants are at an end, all must be baptized anew. An apostle is an elder; he shall baptize, ordain other elders, priests, teachers, and deacons, administer bread and wine, emblems of the flesh and blood of Christ; he shall confirm, teach, expound, exhort, taking the lead at meetings, and conducting them as he is taught by the holy ghost. The priest's duty is to preach, teach, expound, exhort, baptize, administer the sacrament, and visit and pray with members ; he may also ordain other priests, teachers, and deacons, giving a certifi cate of ordination, and lead in meetings when no elder is present. The teacher's duty is to watch over and strengthen the members, preventing evil speak ing and all iniquity, to see that the meetings are regu larly held, and to take the lead in them in the absence of elder or priest. The deacon's duty is to assist the teacher; teacher and deacon may warn, expound, ex hort, but neither of them shall baptize, administer the sacrament, or lay on hands. The elders are to meet in council for the transaction of church business every three months, or oftener should meetings be called.

There shall be presidents, bishops, high counsellors, and high priests; the pre siding elder shall be president of the high priesthood, and he, as well as bishops, high counsellors, and high priests, will be ordained by high council or general conference. The duty of members is to walk in holi ness before the Lord according to the scriptures, to bring their children to the elders, who will lay their hands on them and bless them in the name of Jesus Christ. The bible, that is to say, the scriptures of the old and new testaments, is accepted wholly, save such corruptions as have crept in through the great and abominable church; the book of Mormon is a later revelation, supplementary thereto.

The first miracle likewise occurred during the same month, Joseph Smith casting out a devil from Newel Knight, son of Joseph Knight, who with his family had been universalists. Newel had been a constant attendant at the meetings, and was much interested; but when he attempted to pray the devil prevented him, writhing his limbs into divers distortions, and hurling him about the room. \"I know that you can deliver me from this evil spirit,\" cried Newel. Whereupon Joseph rebuked the devil in the name of Jesus Christ, and the evil spirit departed from the young man. Seeing this, others came forward and expressed their belief in the new faith, and a church was established at Coles ville. On the 1st of June the first conference as an or ganized church was held, there being thirty members. The meeting was opened by singing and prayer, after which they partook of the sacrament, which was fol lowed by confirmations and further ordinations to the several offices of the priesthood. The exercises were attended by the outpouring of the holy ghost, and many prophesied, to the infinite joy and gratification of the elders. Some time after, on a Saturday previous to an appointed sabbath on which baptism was to be performed, the brethren constructed, across a stream of water, a dam, which was torn away by a mob during the night. The meeting was held, however, though amid the sneers and insults of the rabble, Oliver preach ing. Present among others was Emily Coburn, Newel Knight's wife's sister, formerly a presbyterian. Her pastor, the Rev. Mr Shearer, arrived, and tried to persuade her to return to her father.

The same night Joseph was arrested by a constable on a charge of disorderly conduct, and for preaching the book of Mormon. It was the purpose of the populace to capture Joseph from the constable and use him roughly, but by hard driving he escaped. At the trial which followed, an attempt was made to prove certain charges, namely, that he obtained a horse from Josiah Stoal, and a yoke of oxen from Jonathan Thompson, by saying that in a revelation he was told that he was to have them; also as touching his conduct toward two daughters of Mr Stoal ; but all testified in his favor, and he was acquitted. As he was leaving the court-room, he was again arrested on a warrant from Broome county, and taken midst insults and buffetings to Colesville for trial. The old charges were renewed, and new ones preferred. Newel Knight was made to testify regarding the miracle wrought in his behalf, and a story that the prisoner had been a money digger was advanced by the prosecu tion. Again he was acquitted, and again escaped from the crowd outside the court-house, whose purpose it was to tar and feather him, and ride him on a rail. These persecutions were instigated, it was said, chiefly by presbyterians. While Joseph rested at his home at Harmony fur ther stories were circulated, damaging to his character, this time by the methodists. One went to his father in-law with falsehoods, and so turned him and his family against Joseph and his friends that he would no longer afford them protection or receive their doc trine. This was a heavy blow; but proceeding in August to Colesville, Joseph and Hyrum Smith and John and David Whitmer continued the work of prayer and confirmation. Fearing their old enemies, who lay in wait to attack them on their way back, they prayed that their eyes might be blinded; and so it came to pass.

Removing his family to Fayette, Joseph encountered further persecutions, to which was added a fresh grief. Hiram Page was going astray over a stone which he had found, and by means of which he had obtained revelations at va- riance with Joseph's revelations and the rules of the new testament. It was thought best not to agitate the subject unnecessarily, before the meeting of the conference to be held on the 1st of September; but the Whitmer family and Oliver Cowdery seeming to be too greatly impressed over the things set forth by the rival stone, it was resolved to inquire of the Lord concerning the matter; whereupon a revelation came to Oliver Cowdery, forbidding such practice; and he was to say privately to Hiram Page that Satan had deceived him, and that the things which he had written from the stone were not of God. Oliver was further commanded to go and preach the gospel to the Lamanites,23 the remnants of the house of Joseph living in the west,24 where he was to estab- 23 'The Lamanites originally were a remnant of Joseph, and in the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, King of Judah, were led in a miraculous man ner from Jerusalem to the eastern borders of the Red Sea, thence for some time along its borders in a nearly south-east direction, after which they altered their course nearly eastward, until they came to the great waters, where by the command of God they built a vessel in which they were safely brought across the great Pacific Ocean, and landed upon the western coast of South America. The original party included also the Nephites, their leader being a prophet called Nephi; but soon after landing they separated, because the Lamanites, whose leader was a wicked man called Laman, persecuted the others. After the partition the Nephites, who had brought with them the old testament down to the time of Jeremiah, engraved on plates of brass, in the Egyptain language, prospered and built large cities. But the bold, bad Lamanites, originally white, became dark and dirty, though still retaining a national existence. They became wild, savage, and ferocious, seeking by every means the destruction of the prosperous Nephites, against whom they many times arrayed their hosts in battle; but were repulsed aud driven back to their own territories, generally with great loss to both sides.

Hyrum gazed at him in amazement; for converts of this quality, and after this fashion, were not com mon in those days of poverty and sore trial. He was little more than a boy, being but twenty-three, 171)"], [126, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 72 and of that fresh, fair innocence which sits only on a youthful face beaming with high enthusiasm. But it was more than a boy's\" soul that was seen through those eyes of deep and solemn earnestness; it was more than a boy's strength of endurance that was in dicated by the broad chest and comely, compact limbs; and more than a boy's intelligence and powers of reasoning that the massive brow betokened. Hyrum took the stranger to the house, and they passed the night in discourse, sleeping little. The convert's name was Parley P. Pratt. He was a na tive of Burlington, New York, and born April 12, 1807. His father was a farmer of limited means and education, and though not a member of any religious society, had a respect for all. The boy had a passion for books; the bible especially he read over and over again with deep interest and enthusiasm. He early manifested strong religious feeling; mind and soul seemed all on fire as he read of the patriarchs and kings of the old testament, and of Christ and his apostles of the new. In winter at school, and in summer at work, his life passed until he was sixteen, when he went west with his father William, some two hundred miles on foot, to Oswego, two miles from which town they bargained for a thickly wooded tract of seventy acres, at four dollars an acre, paying some seventy dollars in cash. After a summer's work for wages back near the old home, and a winter's work clearing the forest farm, the place was lost through failure to meet the remaining payments. Another attempt to make a forest home, this time in Ohio, thirty miles west of Cleveland, was more suc cessful; and after much toil and many hardships, he found himself, in 1827, comfortably established there, with Thankful Halsey as his wife. Meanwhile religion ran riot through his brain. His mind, however, was of a reasoning, logical caste. \"Why this difference,\" he argued, \"between the an cient and modern Christians, their doctrines and their"], [127, "PARLEY PRATT. 73 practice? Had I lived and believed in the days of the apostles, and had so desired, they would have said, 'Repent, be baptized, and receive the holy ghost.' The scriptures are the same now as then; why should not results be the same ? \" In the absence of anything better, he joined the baptists, and was immersed; but he was not satisfied. In 1829 Sidney Rigdon, of whom more hereafter, preached in his neighborhood; he heard him and was refreshed. It was the ancient gospel revived \u2014 repentance, baptism, the gift of the holy ghost. And yet there was something lacking \u2014 the authority to minister; the power which should accompany the form of apostleship. At length he and others, who had heard Rigdon, organized a society on the basis of his teachings, and Parley began to preach. The spirit working in him finally compelled him to abandon his farm and go forth to meet his destiny, he knew not whither. In this frame of mind he wan- dered eastward, and while his family were visiting friends, he came upon the book of Mormon and Hy rum Smith. Now did his soul find rest. Here was inspiration and revelation as of old; here was a new dispensation with attendant signs and miracles. As he left Smith's house the following morning, having an appointment to preach some thirty miles distant, Hyrum gave him a copy of the sacred book. Travelling on foot, and stopping now and then to rest, he read at intervals, and found to his great joy that soon after his ascension Christ had appeared in his glorified body to the remnant of the tribe of Joseph in America, that he had administered in person to the ten lost tribes, that the gospel had been revealed and written among nations unknown to the apostles, and that thus preserved it had escaped the corruptions of the great and abominable church. Returning to Smith's house, Parley demanded of Hyrum baptism. They went to Whitmer's, where they were warmly welcomed by a little branch of the church there assembled. The new convert was bap-"], [128, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 74 tized by Cowdery, and was ordained an elder. He continued to preach in those parts with great power. Congregations were moved to tears, and many heads of families came forward and accepted the faith. Then he went to his old home. His father, mother, and some of the neighbors believed only in part ; but his brother Orson, nineteen years of age, embraced with eagerness the new religion, and preached it from that time forth. Returning to Manchester, Parley for the first time met Joseph Smith, who received him warmly, and asked him to preach on Sunday, which he did, Joseph following with a discourse. Revelations continued, now in the way of command, and now in the spirit of prophecy. In Harmony, to the first elder it was spoken: \"Magnify thine office; and after thou hast sowed thy fields and secured them, go speedily unto the churches which are in Colesville, Fayette, and Manchester, and they shall support thee; and I will bless them, both spiritually and temporally; but if they receive thee not, I will send on them a cursing instead of a blessing, and thou shalt shake the dust off thy feet against them as a testimony, and wipe thy feet by the wayside.\" And to Cowdery, thus: \"Oliver shall continue in bearing my name before the world, and also to the church; and he shall take neither purse nor scrip, neither staves nor even two coats.\" To Emma, wife of Jo seph: \"Thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou art an elect lady, whom I have called; and thou shalt com fort thy husband, my servant Joseph, and shalt go with him, and be unto him as a scribe in the absence of my servant Oliver, and he shall support thee.\" Emma was also further directed to make a selection of hymns to be used in church.1 1 The hymn-book of Emma Smith does not appear to have been published, but a little book containing hymns selected by Brigham Young passed through eight editions up to 1849, the eighth being published in Liverpool in that year.

Pratt, and John"], [129, "SIDNEY RIGDON. 75 In the presence of six elders, at Fayette, in Septem ber 1830, came the voice of Jesus Christ, promising them every blessing, while the wicked should be de stroyed. The millennium should come; but first dire destruction should fall upon the earth, and the great and abominable church should be cast down. Hiram Page renounced his stone. David Whitmer was or dered to his father's house, there to await further in structions. Peter Whitmer junior, Parley P. Pratt, and Ziba Peterson were directed to go with Oliver and assist him in preaching the gospel to the Laman ites, that is to say, to the Indians in the west, the remnant of the tribe of Joseph. Thomas B. Marsh was promised that he should begin to preach. Miracles were limited to casting out devils and healing the sick. Wine for sacramental purposes must not be bought, but made at home.2 Taking with them a copy of the revelation assign ing to them this work, these first appointed mission aries set out, and continued their journey, preaching in the villages through which they passed, and stop ping at Buffalo to instruct the Indians as to their an cestry, until they came to Kirtland, Ohio. There they remained some time, as many came forward and embraced their faith, among others Sidney Rigdon, a preaching elder in the reformed baptist church, who presided over a congregation there, a large portion of whom likewise became interested in the latter-day church.3 Taylor. The preface to the ninth edition, published at Liverpool and Lon don in 1851, is by Franklin D. Richards, who states that 54,000 copies of the several editions have been sold in the European missions alone within eleven years. Several editions have since been published in Europe and America. 2 Smith says: 'In order to preparo for this (conlirmation) I set out to go to procure some wine for the occasion, but had goue only a short distance when I was met by a heavenly messenger, and received the revelation.

To these people the missionaries re paired and preached with some success, gathering in seventeen on the first occasion.

He worked on his father's farm until he was twenty-six, when he went to live with the Rev. Andrew Clark, and the same year, 1819, was licensed to preach. Thence he went to Warren, Ohio, and married; and after preaching for a time he was called to take charge of a church at Pittsburgh, where he met with success, and soon became very popular. But his mind was perplexed over the doc trines he was required to promulgate, and in 1824 he retired from his ministry. There were two friends who had likewise withdrawn from their respective churches, and with whom he conferred freely, Alex ander Campbell, of his own congregation, and one Walter Scott, of the Scandinavian church of that city. Campbell had formerly lived at Bethany, Virginia, where was issued under his auspices a monthly jour nal called the Christian Baptist. Out of this friend ship and association arose a new church, called the Campbellites, its doctrines having been published by Campbell in his paper. During the next two years Rigdon was obliged to work in a tannery to support his family; then he removed to Bainbridge, Ohio, where he again began to preach, confining him self to no creed, but leaning toward that of the Camp bellites. Crowds flocked to hear him, and a church was established in a neighboring town through his in strumentality. After a year of this work he accepted a call to Mentor, thirty miles distant. Slanderous reports followed him, and a storm of persecution set in against him; but by his surpassing eloquence and deep reasoning it was not only soon allayed, but greater multitudes than ever waited on his ministra tions. mon concluded to accept its doctrines, and together with his wife was bap tized into the church, which now numbered about twenty in this section.

As a man, however, his charac ter seems to have had a tinge of insincerity. He was fickle, now and then petulant, irascible, and sometimes domineering. Later, Joseph Smith took occasion more than once to rebuke him sharply, fearing that he might assume the supremacy. Upon hearing the arguments of Pratt and Cow dery, and investigating the book of Mormon, Rigdon was convinced that he had not been legally ordained, and that his present ministry was without the divine authority. In regard to the revival of the old dis pensation, he argued thus: \"If we have not familiar ity enough with our creator to ask of him a sign, we are no Christians; if God will not give his creatures one, he is no better than Juggernaut.\" The result was, that he and others accepted the book and its teach ings,4 received baptism and the gift of the holy ghost, and were ordained to preach. On one occasion Cowdery preached, followed by Rigdon. After service they went to the Chagrin River to baptize. Rigdon stood in the stream and poured forth his exhortations with eloquent fervor. One after another stepped forward until thirty had been baptized. Present upon the bank was a hard headed lawyer, Varnem J. Card, who as he listened grew pale with emotion. Suddenly he seized the arm of a friend and whispered, \"Quick, take me away, or in a moment more I shall be in that water I\" One hundred and twenty-seven converts at once, the num- ' Howe intimates that Rigdon knew more of the book and the people than he pretended.

Their minds had become fully prepared to embrace Mormonism, or any other mysterious ism that should first present itself. Seventeen in number of these persons readily believed the whole story of Cowdery about the finding of the golden plates and the spectacles. They were all reimmersed in one night by Cowdery.

Will iams, the missionaries continued on their way, arriving first at Sandusky, where they gave instructions to the Indians in regard to their forefathers, as they had done at Buffalo, and thence proceeded to Cincinnati and St Louis. In passing by his old forest home, Pratt was arrested on some trivial charge, but made his escape. The winter was very severe, and it was some time before they could continue their journey. At length they set out again, wading in snow knee deep, carrying their few effects on their backs, and having to eat corn bread and frozen raw pork; and after travelling in all fifteen hundred miles, most of the way on foot, preaching to tens of thousands by the way, and organizing hundreds into churches, they reached Independence, Missouri, in the early part of 1831. There Whitmer and Peterson went to work as tailors, while Pratt and Cowdery passed over the 6 Speaking of the doings at Kirtland after the departure of the Lainanite mission, Mr Howe says: 'Scenes of the most wild, frantic, and horrible fanat icism ensued. They pretended that the power of miracles was about to be given to all those who embraced the new faith, and commenced communicat ing the holy spirit by laying their hands upon the heads of the converts, which operation at first produced an instantaneous prostration of body and mind. Many would fall upon the floor, where they would lie for a long time apparently lifeless. They thus continued these enthusiastic exhibitions for several weeks. The fits usually came on during or after their prayer meetings, which were held nearly every evening. The young men and wo men were more particularly subject to this delirium. They would exhibit all the apish actions imaginable, making the most ridiculous grimaces, creeping upon their hands and feet, rolling upon the frozen ground, go through with all the Indian modes of warfare, such as knocking down, scalping, ripping open and tearing out the bowels. At other times they would run through the fields, get upon stumps, preach to imaginary congregations, enter the water and perform all the ceremony of baptizing, etc. Many would have fits of speaking all the different Indian dialects, which none could understand. Again, at the dead hour of uight the young men might be seen running over the fields and hills in pursuit, as they said, of the balls of fire, light, etc., which they saw moving through the atmosphere. . .On the arrival of Smith in Kirtland he appeared astonished at the wild enthusiasm and scalping per formances of his proselytes there. He told them that he had inquired of the Lord concerning the matter, and had been informed that it was all the work of the devil, as heretofore related.

The chief of the Delawares was sachem of ten tribes. He received the missionaries with courtesy, and set food before them. When they asked him to call a council before which they might expound their doctrines, he at first declined, then assented; where upon Cowdery gave them an account of their ances tors, as contained in the wonderful book, a copy of which he left with the chief on taking his depart ure, which soon occurred; for when it was known upon the border settlements what the missionaries were doing, they were ordered out of the Indian coun try as disturbers of the peace.6 After preaching a short time in Missouri, the five brethren thought it best that one of their number should return east and report. The choice fell on Pratt. Starting out on foot, he reached St Louis, three hundred miles dis tant, in nine days. Thence he proceeded by steamer to Cincinnati, and from that point journeyed on foot to Strongville, forty miles from Kirtland. Overcome by fatigue and illness, he was forced to remain at this place some ten days, when he continued his journey on horseback. He was welcomed at Kirtland by hundreds of the saints, Joseph Smith himself being present.

On the 2d of January a conference is held at Fayette, attended by revelations and prophecy. James Col ville, a baptist minister, accepts the faith, but shortly recants, being tempted of Satan, and in fear of per secution.8 Smith and his wife go with Rigdon and white appear black and black white as any other man; and at all times pre- pared to establish, to the satisfaction of great numbers of people, the negative or affirmative of any and every question from scripture, he was forthwith appointed to promulgate all the absurdities and ridiculous pretensions of Mormonism, and call on the holy prophets to prove all the words of Smith. But the miraculous powers conferred upon him we do not learn have yet been put iu requisition. It seems that the spirit had not, before the arrival of Rigdon, told Smith anything about the promised land, or his removal to Ohio. It is therefore very questionable what manner of spirit it was which dic- tated most of the after movements of the prophet. The spirit of Rigdon, it must be presumed, however, generally held sway; for a revelation was soon had that Kirtland, the residence of Rigdon and his brethren, was to be the eastern border of the promised land, and from thence to the Pacific Ocean. On this land the New Jerusalem, the city of refuge, was to be built. Upon it all true Mormons were to assemble, to escape the destruction of the world which was so soon to take place.' Howe's Mormonism Unveiled, 109-10. Tucker, Origin and Prog.

After going through with a ceremonious form of prayer, in which he expressed his grateful sense of the blessings of the glorious gospel dispensation now opening to the world, and the miraculous light from heaven to be displayed through the instrumentality of the chosen revelator, Joseph Smith Jr, ...he announced his text as fol- lows : First book of Nephi, chapter iv.\u2014 \" And the angel spake unto me, say- ing, These last records which thou hast seen among the gentiles shall estab- lish the truth of the first, which is of the twelve apostles of the lamb, and shall make known the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people that the lamb of God is the son of the eternal father and saviour of the world; and that all men must come unto him or they cannot be saved. \" The preacher assumed to establish the theory that the book of Mormon and the old bible were one in inspiration and importance, and that the precious things now re- vealed had for wise purposes been withheld from the book first promulgated to the world, and were necessary to establish its truth. In the course of his argument he applied various quotations from the two books to prove his posi- l ?f V a i 1D? the b\u00b0\u00b0k \u00b0f Mormo'1 in his right hand, and the bible in his lett hand he brought them together iu a manner corresponding to the em- phatic declaration made by him, that they were both equally the word of God- that neither was perfect without the other; and that they were inseparably necessary to complete the everlasting gospel of the saviour Jesus Christ.' It is said that Rigdon, after his return to Kirtland from his visit to Smith in oneofliiscloiiiieiit discourses on the new faith, 'gave a challenge to the w\"\u00b0\u00abd to disprove the new bible, and the pretensions of its authors.' Rigdon's old triend, lhomas Campbell, hearing of it, wrote him from Mentor accept ing, at the same time enclosing an outline of what his line of argument would be.

At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to a hatter. His was an earnest, thoughtful nature, and his mind much troubled about religion. In 1828 he entered Sidney Rigdon's Qamp bellite church, and in that faith remained until met by the missionaries Pratt, Cowdery, and the others, when he accepted the new revelation, and was subse quently baptized by Joseph in the Seneca River. He had a profitable business at the time; but when it was revealed that he should leave his merchandise and de vote his whole time to the church, he obeyed without a murmur. Joseph and Sidney were much together now in their revelations and rulings. A woman attempted prophe sying and was rebuked. Sarcasm was employed, and scurrilous stories were printed in the newspapers ; an ac count of a great Asiatic earthquake was headed \"Mor monism in China.\" Revelations during March were frequent.

In March 1831 John Whitmer was appointed to keep the church record and history continually, Oliver having been appointed to other labors. Whitmer was assisted, temporarily, on occasions of absence or illness by Warren Parrish. At a meeting of high council at Kirtland, Sept. 14, 1835, it was decided that \"Oliver Cowdery be appointed, and that he act hereafter as recorder for the church,\" Whitmer having just been called to be editor of the Messenger and Advocate.

Whether the prophet himself ever declared that these things had been revealed to him, or that he had seen them through his magic stone or silver spectacles, we will not say; but that such stories and hundreds of others equally absurd were told by those who were in daily intercourse with him, as being events which would probably take place, are susceptible of proof.'

It was or dered that if any had more than they required, let them give to the church; if any had less, let the church relieve their necessities. The 6th of June a confer ence of elders was held at Kirtland, and several re ceived the authority of the Melchisedec priesthood. The next conference should be held in Missouri, whither Joseph and Sidney should proceed at once, and there it would be told them what to do.

Many travelled fifty and a hundred miles to the throne of the prophet in Kirtland, to hear from his own mouth the certainty of his excavating a bible and spectacles. Many, even in the New England states, after hearing the frantic story of some of these elders, would forthwith place their all into a wagon, and wend their way to the promised land, in order, as they supposed, to escape the judgments of heaven, which were soon to be poured out upon the land. The state of New York, they were privately told, would most probably be sunk, unless the people thereof believed in the pretensions of Smith. ' Mormonism Unveiled, 115-16. \"Howe writes thus of Phelps: 'Before the rise of Mormonism he was an avowed infidel; having a remarkable propensity for fame and eminence, be was supercilious, haughty, and egotistical. His great ambition was to em bark in some speculation where he could shine preeminent. He took an active part for several years in the political contests of New York, and made no little display as an editor of a partisan newspaper, and after being foiled in his desires to become a candidate for lieutenant-governor of that state, his attention was suddenly diverted by the prospects which were held out to him in the gold-bible speculation. In this he was sure of becoming a great man, and made the dupes believe he was master of fourteen dif ferent languages, of which they frequently boasted. But he soon found that the prophet would suffer no growing rivalships, whose sagacity he had not well calculated, until he was met by a revelation which informed him that he could rise no higher than a printer.'

And thus saith the Lord your God, if you wdll receive wisdom here is wisdom. Behold the place which is now called Inde pendence is the centre place, and the spot for the temple is lying westward upon a lot which is not far from the court-house: wherefore it is wisdom that the land should be purchased by the saints; and also every tract lying westward, even unto the line run ning directly between jew and gentile; and also every tract bordering by the prairies, inasmuch as my disci ples are enabled to buy lands.\" Further, Sidney Gilbert was made church agent, to receive money and buy lands; he was also directed to establish a store. Partridge was to partition the lands purchased among the people; Phelps was made church printer. But the last two becoming a little headstrong on entering upon their new duties, Joseph found it necessary to reprimand and warn them. Harris was held up as an example to emulate, for he had given much to the church. It was or dered that an agent be appointed to raise money in Ohio to buy lands in Missouri, and Rigdon was com missioned to write a description of the new land of Zion for the same purpose. Ziba Peterson was dis possessed of his lands, and made to work for others, in punishment for his misdemeanors. Thus the latter-day saints had come to the border line of civilization, and looking over it into the west they thought here to establish themselves forever.

Next day the ground for the temple, situated a little west of Independence,15 was dedicated, and the day fol lowing was held the first conference in the land of Zion.16 It was now commanded that Smith, Rigdon, Cow dery, and others should return east, and make more proselytes, money for the purpose to be furnished them out of the general fund.17 Accordingly on the 16 Of Independence one of them says: 'It is a new town, containing a court house built of brick, two or three merchants' stores, and 15 or 20 dwelling houses built mostly of logs hewed on both sides; and is situated on a handsome rise of ground about three miles south of Missouri River, and about 12 miles east of the dividing line between the United States and the Indian reserve, and is the county seat of Jackson county.

On the south side of the Missouri, Parley Pratt says, Auto biography, 78, 'some families were entirely dressed in skins, without any other clothing, including ladies young and old. Buildings were generally without glass windows, and the door open in winter for a light.' 10 Booth, in Howe's Mormonism Unveiled, 196-9, says: 'The designation of the site where the city of Zion was to begin was attended with considerable parade and an ostentatious display of talents, both by Rigdon and Cowdery. And the next day the ground for the temple was consecrated, Smith claiming the honor of laying the corner-stone himself. The location of the stone was marked by a sapling from which the bark was removed on the north and east sides: on the south side a letter T was cut, which stood for temple, and on the east sideZom., for Zomas; which Smith said is the original word for Zion. This stone was placed near the foot of the sapling and covered with bushes cut for the purpose; the spot being on an elevation half a mile from Inde pendence.' 'The Colesville branch was among the first organized by Joseph Smith, and constituted the first settlers of the members of the church in Missouri. They had arrived late in the summer and cut some hay for their cattle, sowed a little grain, prepared some ground for cultivation, and were engaged during the fall and winter in building log cabins, etc. The winter was cold, and for some time about 10 families lived in one cabin, which was open and unfinished, while the frozen ground served for a floor. Our food consisted of beef, and a little bread made of corn which had been grated into coarse meal by rubbing the ears on a tin grater.' Pratt's Autobiogra phy, 76. See also Millennial Star, v. 131.

It was provided that those wishing to buy land in Zion could do so by forwarding the purchase money. The account of the new country written by Sidney Rigdon did not please Joseph, and he was or dered to write another; if that should not prove satis factory, he was to be deprived of office.19 On the 12th of September Joseph removed to the town of Hiram, thirty miles away, and prepared to begin again the translation of the bible, with Rigdon as scribe.

They are nine in number, and are full of general denunciation and sorrow over his past blindness, and an account of the hardships and disappointments attending his journey to and from Missouri. I quote the more pertinent points. 'When I embraced Mormonism I conscientiously believed it to be of God.' ' The relation in which Smith stands to the church is that of a prophet, seer, revealer, and translator; and when he speaks by the spirit, or says he knows a thing by the communication of the spirit, it is received as coming directly from the mouth of the Lord.' 'This system, to some, carries the force of plausibility, and appears under an imposing form. It claims the bible for its patron, and proffers the restoration of the apostolic church, with all the gifts and graces with which the primitive saints were endowed.' 'Many of them have been ordained to the high priesthood, or the order of Melchisedec, and profess to be endowed with the same power as the ancient apostles were. But they have been hitherto unsuccessful iu finding the lame, the halt, and the blind who had the faith sufficient to become the subjects of their miracles, and it is now concluded that this work must be postponed until they get to Missouri; for the Lord will not show those signs to this wicked and adulterous generation. In the commandment given to the churches in the state of New York to remove to the state of Ohio, they were assured that these miracles should be wrought in the state of Ohio; but now they must be deferred until they are settled in Missouri.' 'Everything in the church is done by com mandment; and yet it is said to be done by the voice of the church. For instance, Smith gets a commandment that he shall be the head of the church, or that he shall rule the conference, or that the church shall build him an elegant house and give him 1,000 dollars. For this the members of the church must vote, or they will be cast off for rebelling against the commandments of the Lord. ' 'Smith describes an angel as having the appearance of a tall, slim, well built, handsome man, with a bright pillar upon his head. ' The bishop's 'business is to superintend the secular concerns of the church. He holds a deed of the lands; and the members receive a writing from him signifying that they are to possess the land as their own so long as they are obedient to Smith's commandments.' 'The Lord's storehouse is to be furnished with good3 suited to the Indian trade, and persons are to obtain license from the government to dispose of them to the Indians in their own territory; at the same time they are to disseminate the principles of Mormonism among them.'"], [144, "90 THE STORY OF MORMONISM. was appointed bishop, to receive and account for church funds collected by the various elders. Many of the elders who went to Missouri were by this time at work in different parts of the east and the west.21 On the 16th of February, 1832, while Smith and Rigdon were translating the gospel of St John, they were favored by a glorious vision from the Lord,22 which gave them great comfort and encouragement. The revelations about this time were frequent and lengthy, their purport being in great part to direct the move ments of missionaries. Simonds Rider and Eli, Ed ward, and John Johnson now apostatized. On the night of the 25th of March, Smith and Rigdon were seized by a mob, composed partly of the Campbellites, methodists, and baptists of Hiram, twelve or fifteen being apostate Mormons. The cap tives were roughly treated, and expected to be killed; but after they had been stripped, beaten, and well covered with tar and feathers, they were released. Smith preached and baptized as usual the next day, Sunday, but Rigdon was delirious for some time after ward.23 This broke up for the present the translation 21 'Thirty or forty elders were sent off in various directions in pursuit of proselytes, and the yearpassed off with a gradual increase.'

Smith and some of the elders attended a conference at Amherst, Loraine Co., after returning from which both himself and Rigdon were shown the devil in a vision, and had the revelation of St John explained to them. In March it was revealed that steps should be taken to regulate and establish storehouses for the benefit of the poor, both at Kirtland and at Zion.

The spirit of mobocracy was aroused throughout the entire country. Joseph even feared to go to Kirtland, and escaped by way of Warren, where he was joined by Rigdon, whence the two proceeded to Cincinnati and St Louis by way of Wheeling, Virginia, a mob following them a good part of the way.

Smith merely says that Rigdon was mad; but his mother asserts that he counterfeited the madness in order to mislead the saints into the belief that the keys of the kingdom had been taken from the church, and would not be restored, as he said, until they had built him a new house. This, she says, gave rise to great scandal, which Joseph however succeeded in silencing. Rigdon repented and was forgiven. He stated that as a punishment for his fault, the devil had three times thrown him out of his bed in one night. Remy's Journey to Great Salt Lake, i. 283 (note). \"The 26th of April Smith called a general council, which acknowledged him as president of the high priesthood, to which he had been ordained at the Amherst conference in January, and Bishop Partridge and Rigdon, who had quarrelled, were reconciled, probably by Smith, as Rigdon was supposed to be at Kirtland at the time.

The first consists of seven lectures on faith, delivered by Sidney Rigdon before a class of elders at Kirtland; the second is called Covenants and Commandments, and consists chiefly of revela tions given 1830-42, to Joseph Smith, the same for the most part that are also printed in Times and Seasons, under title of History of Joseph Smith. There are also rules, minutes of council, visions, and expositions. The appendix contains rules on marriage, a dissertation on government and laws, and a brief account of Joseph and Hyrum Smith.

Smith was poisoned, and that so badly that he dislocated his jaw in vomiting, and the hair upon his head became loosened; Whitney, however, laid his hands on him, and administered in the name of the Lord, and he was healed in an instant.27 Some three or four hundred saints being now gath ered in Missouri, most of them settled on their own inheritances in this land of Zion, besides many others scattered abroad throughout the land, who were yet to come hither, it was deemed best to give the matter of schools some attention.

On April 27th considerable business was transacted 'for the salvation of the saints who were settling among a fero cious set of mobbers, like lambs among wolves.' On the 28th and 29th Smith visited the settlement above Big Blue River in Kaw township, 12 miles west of Independence, including the Colesville branch, and returned on the 30th, when it was revealed that all minors should be supported by their parents, but after becoming of age ' they had claims upon the church, or in other words, the Lord's storehouse,' as was also the case with widows left destitute.

Each elder washes his own feet first, after which Joseph girds himself with a towel and washes the feet of them all. \"Be- hold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, in conse quence of evils and designs, which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarned you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation, that inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good, nor meet in the sight of your father. And again, tobacco is not for the body, nei ther for the belly, and it is not good for man. And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly.\" 28 Hardly had President Smith turned his back upon Zion, when dissensions broke out among the saints there. He corresponded regularly with the Star, giving advice and warning, but matters apparently grew worse, for in Janu - ary 1833 a conference of twelve high priests was held at Kirtland, or Kirt land Mills, as they now called their settlement, at which Orson Hyde and Hyrum Smith were appointed to write an epistle to the brotherhood of Zion. The document was dated Jan. 14th, and began: ' From a conference of 12 high priests to the bishop, his council, and the inhabitants of Zion.' After pre mising that Smith and certain others had written on this all-important sub ject, and that the replies received had not given satisfactory assurances oi confession and repentance, charges were made that old grievances, supposed to be settled, had been again brought up in a censorious spirit, and that they had accused Brother Smith of seeking after monarchical power and authority. This complaint was made by Carroll in a letter dated June 2d. Again, Brother Gilbert, on Dec. 10th, wrote a letter which contained 'low, dark, and blind insinuations, which they declined to entertain, though the writer's claims and pretensions to holiness were great.' Brother Phelps, Dec. 15th, wrote a letter betraying 'a lightness of spirit that ill becomes a man placed in the important and responsible station that he is placed in.' To a request that Smith should come to Zion, made by Phelps in a previous letter, it was answered that ' Brother Smith will not settle in Zion until she repent and purify herself. . .and remember the commandments that have been given her to do them as well as say them.' Finally, it was threatened that unless these disturbances should cease, they should all be cutoff, and the Lord would seek another place.

Painesville is situated but a short distance from Kirtland, then the headquarters of Mormonism, where about that time was ordained the first quorum of the twelve apostles, and Sidney Rigdon was delivering Joseph Smith's famous lectures on faith, subsequently printed in Doctrine and Cove nants, already noticed. Here also, shortly afterward, the first Mormon temple was dedicated. Great excitement prevailed throughout that section regasdiny religion, and the book was widely circulated. It was a powerful weapon, and promptly and skillfully handled; yet itseems to have been no serious bar rier to the dissemination of the new doctrines. The work is well written: and while not vehement in its denunciations, it brings forward a large mass of evidence to prove, as he says, 'the depths of folly, degradation, and super stition to which human nature can be carried.' He observes that 'the diffi culty of procuring, or arriving at the whole truth, in relation to a religious imposition which has from its birth been so studiously veiled in secrecy, and generally under a belief that the judgments of God would follow any dis closures of what its votaries had seen or heard, will be readily discovered.' The author begins with some account of the Smith family. Their thoughts turned greatly toward gaining possession of hidden treasures. Young Joseph 'had become very expert in the arts of necromancy, juggliug, the use of the divining rod, and looking into what they termed a peep-stone, by which means he soon collected about him a gang of idle, credulous young men, to perform the labor of digging into the hills and mountains, and other lonely places in that vicinity in search of gold.' After comments on Cowdery, Har ris, and Whitmer, Mr Howe gives a commentary on the golden bible. Some 63 pages are devoted to this, and to observations on the credibility of the threo and the eight witnesses. Sarcasm is the weapon employed, and gen erally with effect; the exposition in regard to contradictions and historical inaccuries might apply with equal force to the bible, the koran, or any other sacred book. Mention is next made of Pratt's conversion, which, he intimates, was not accidental, followed by an account of the expedition to the Lam anites. Thus the line of events is followed by Mr Howe to the time of the publication of his book, at the end of which are given letters and testimonials to disprove the statements and doctrines of the Mormons, and also to prove that the book of Mormon was the work of Spaulding.

Each square was to contain ten acres, or 660 feet fronts. Lots were to be laid out alternately in the squares; in one, fronting north or south; in the next east or west; each lot extending to the centre line of its square, with a frontage of 66 feet and a depth of 330 feet, or half an acre. By this ar rangement in one square the houses would stand on one street, and in the square opposite on another street. Through the middle of the plot ran a range of blocks 660 feet by 990 feet set apart for the public buildings, and in these the lots were all laid off north and south, the greatest length of the blocks being from east to w-est: thus making all the lots equal in size. The whole plot was supposed to be sufficient for the accommodation of from 15,000 to 20,000 people. All stables, barns, etc., were to be built north or south of the plot, none being permitted in the city among the houses. Sufficient ad joining ground on all sides was to be reserved for supplying the city with vegetables, etc. All streets were to be 132 feet (8 perches) wide, and a like width was to be laid off between the temple and its surrounding streets. But one house was to be built on a lot, and that must front on a line 25 feet from the street, the space iu front to be set out with trees, shrubs, etc., according to the builder's taste. All houses to be of either brick or stone. The house of the Lord for the presidency was to be 61 feet by 87 feet, 10 feet of the length for a stairway. The interior was so arranged as to permit its division into 4 parts by curtains. At the east and west ends were to be pulpits arranged for the several grades of president and council, bishop and council, high priests and elders, at the west; and the lesser priesthood, comprising presidency, priests, teachers, and deacons, at the east. Provision was also made to seat visiting officers according to their grades. The pews were fitted with sliding seats, so that the audience could face either pulpit as required. There was to be no gallery, but the house was to be divided into 2 stories of 14 feet each. A bell of very large size was also ordered. Finally, on each public building must be written, Holiness to the Lord. When this plot was settled, another was to be laid out, and so on. Times and Seasons, vi. 785-7, 800.

A declaration, in substance as follows, was drawn up and signed by nearly all present. The citizens of Jack son county fear the effect upon society of a pretended religious sect, fanatics or knaves, settling among them, and mean to get rid of them at any hazard, and for the following reasons: They blasphemously pretend to personal intercourse with the deity, to revelations, miracles, healing the sick, casting out devils, and other delusions ; they are the dregs of society, held together by the acts .of designing leaders, and are idle and vicious. They are poor. They tamper with the slaves and free negroes. They declare the Indian re gion to be theirs by heavenly inheritance. In answer, Parley P. Pratt asks if their supernatural pretensions are more extravagant than those of the old and new testament; if it is anywhere written that there shall be no more spiritual manifestations as of old; does the word of God or the law of man make poverty a crime? and have they not paid for all the land they occupy? They are no more dregs than their neighbors, and the charge of fraternizing with the blacks is not true; neither is that of vice or crime, as secular power into their hands, everything will be performed by immediate revelations from God.

The anti-Mormon press contained at the same time an article entitled \"Beware of false prophets,\" written by a person whom Joseph called a black rod in the hand of Satan. This article was distributed from house to house in Independence and its neighbor hood, and contained many false charges against Smith and his associates, reiterating the calumny about the community of goods and wives.

It is composed largely of revelations, which, save in the one point of commandment which it was the purpose specially to give, are all quite similar.

Then the spirit of mobocracy again appeared. The Jackson-county boys had served themselves well; why should they not help their neighbors? So they crossed the river, in small squads at first, and began to stir up enmity, often insulting and plundering their victims, until the people of Clay county, fearing actions yet worse, held a meeting, and advised the saints to seek another home.7 For their unrelenting hostility toward the latter day saints, for the services rendered to their country in defying its laws and encouraging the outrages upon citizens at Independence and elsewhere during the first Mormon troubles in Missouri, Boo-ors was made governor of that state, Lucas major-general, and Wilson brigadier-general.8 After his election, as be fore, Boggs did not hesitate to let it be known that held at P.

It was well understood that war on the Mormons, Avar on their civil, political, and religious rights, nay, on their presence as members of the commonwealth, or if need be on their lives, was part of the policy of the admin istration. Thereupon the Mormons petitioned the legislature to assign them a place of residence, and the thinly populated region afterward known as Caldwell county was designated. Moving there, they bought the claims of most of the inhabitants, and entered several sections of government lands. Almost every member of the society thus became a landholder, some having eighty acres, and some forty. A town was laid out, called Far West, which was made the county seat ; they were allowed to organize the government of the county, and to appoint from among their own people the officers.9 Again they found peace for a season, during which their, numbers increased, while settlements were made in Daviess county and elsewhere.10 Those in Daviess county were on terms of amity with their gentile neigh bors.

Adam constructed an altar there, and it was there that he bestowed his final blessings upon his descendants.' The place was also called Adam-On-Diahman, Adam-ou-di-ahman, and again Diahman. The second of these names appears to have been the one in use among the saints.

Some ridicule was made at these bearded and bloody daughters, and the name did not sit easily.

Besides the Mormons living there, were a num ber of emigrants awaiting the cessation of hostilities before proceeding on their journey. It had been agreed between the Mormons and Missourians of that locality that they would not molest each other, but live together in peace. But the men of Caldwell and Daviess counties would not have it so. Suddenly and without warning, on the day above mentioned, mounted and to the number of two hundred and forty, they fell upon the fated settlement. While the men were at their work out of doors, the women in the house, and the children playing about the yards, the crack of a hundred rifles was heard, and before the firing ceased, eighteen of these unoffending people were stretched dead upon the ground, while many more were wounded. I will not enter upon the sick ening details, which are copious and fully proven; suffice it to say, that never in savage or other war fare was there perpetrated an act more dastardly and brutal.30 Indeed, it was openly avowed by the men of Missouri that it was no worse to shoot a Mormon than to shoot an Indian, and killing Indians was no worse than killing wild beasts.

This will not do. There is bad blun dering somewhere. It is the Mormons only that are to be killed and driven off, and not the free and loyal American Boggs voters. Ho, there! Let the state arms be turned against these damned saints! On what pretext? Any. Say that they are robbing, and burning, and killing right and left, and that they swear they will never stop until they have the country. Easy enough. No doubt they do kill and burn; the men of Missouri are killing them and burning; why should they not retaliate? No doubt there are thieves and bad men among them, who take advan tage of the time to practise their vile calling. No doubt there are violent men among them, who swear roundly at those who are hunting them to death, who swear that they will drive them off their lands and kill them if they can. But this does not make insur rectionists and traitors of the whole society. No matter; down with the Mormons! And so Boggs, the governor, seats himself and coolly writes off' to his generals to drive out or exterminate the vermin.31 31 Several of them write to Boggs: 'There is no crime, from treason down to petit larceny, but these people, or a majority of them, have been guilty of; all, too, under the counsel of Joseph Smith, Jr, the prophet. They have com mitted treason, murder, arson, burglary, robbery, larceny, and perjury.

Your orders are therefore to hasten your operations, and endeavor to reach Richmond in Ray county, with all possible speed. The Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the state if necessary, for the public good. Their outrages are beyond all description.

In none of their acts had the saints placed themselves in an attitude of un lawful opposition to the state authorities; on the other hand, they were doing all in their power to defend themselves and support law and order, save in the matter of retaliation. The first the saints of Caldwell county know of the new tactics is the appearance, within half a mile of Far West,32 of three thousand armed men, under Gen eral Lucas, generals Wilson and Doniphan being pres ent, and General Clark with another army being a few days' march distant. General Lucas states that the main business there is to obtain possession of three in dividuals, whom he names, two of them not Mormons; and for the rest he has only to inform the saints that it is his painful duty either wholly to drive them from the state or to exterminate them.33 Gilliam and his comrades, who as disguised Indians and white men had been fighting the Mormons, now that the state es pouses their cause, join Lucas.31 General Atchison was at Richmond, in Ray county, when the gover nor's exterminating order was issued. \"I will have nothing to do with so infamous a proceeding,\" he said, and immediately resigned. ceed immediately to Richmond and there operate against the Mormons.

We say we know of no language sufficiently strong for the expression of our shame aud abhorrence of her recent conduct.

It will be observed that an organized mob, aided by many of the civil and military officers of Missouri, with Gov. Boggs at their head, have been the prominent actors in this business, incited, too, it appears, against the Mormons by polit ical hatred, and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge. They have but too well put in execution their threats of extermination and expul sion, and fully wreaked their vengeance on a body of industrious and enter prising men who had never wronged nor wished to wrong them, but on the contrary had ever comported themselves as good and honest citizens, living under the same laws, and having the same right with themselves to the sacred immunities of life, liberty, and property.'

They extend equal privileges and protection to all; each must rest ujjon its own merits and will prosper in proportion to 'the purity of its prin ciples, and the fruit of holiness and piety produced thereby. With regard to the peculiar people mentioned in your letter, I know but little. They had a community in the northern part of Ohio for several years, and I have no rec ollection of ever having heard in that state of any complaint against them of violating the laws of the country. Their religious opinions I conceive have nothing to do with our political transactions. They are citizens of the United States, and are entitled to the same political rights and legal protection that other citizens are entitled to. The foregoing are briefly my views on the sub ject of your inquiries.' In a 'memorial sent to Washington in the autumn of 1839, it was claimed by the Mormons that their property destroyed in Jackson co. was worth \u00a7120,000; that 12,000 souls were banished; that they purchased and improved lands in Clay co., and in three years were obliged to leave there with heavy loss; that they then purchased and improved lands in Daviess and Carroll counties; that for the most part these counties were wild and uncultivated; that they had converted them into large and well improved farms, well' stocked, which were rapidly advancing in cultivation and wealth; and that they were finally compelled to fly from these counties. In a petition pre sented by Sidney Rigdon to the state of Pennsylvania, it is stated that 'Lil burn Boggs, governor of the state, used his executive influence to have us all massacred or driven into exile; and all this because we were not lawless and disobedient. For if the laws had given them a sufficient guaranty against the evils complained of. . .then would they have had recourse to the laws. If we had been transgressors of laws, our houses would not have been rifled our women ravished, our farms desolated, and our goods and chattels destroyed our men killed, our wives and children driven into the prairies, and made to suffer all the indignities that the most brutal barbarity could inflict- but would only have had to suffer that which the laws would inflict which were founded m 3ustice, framed in righteousness, and administered in humanity i yA ' al , thlS C,ruelty ?

A few days later they were taken to Richmond and put in irons, and later to Liberty jail in Clay county, where they were kept confined for four months. Habeas corpus was tried, and many petitions were forwarded to the authorities on their be half, but all to no purpose. At length they obtained a hearing in the courts, with a change of venue to Boone county where they were still to be incarcerated. Rigdon had been previously released on habeas corpus, and one night, when the guard was asleep, Smith and the others escaped and made their way to Quincy. \"I was in their hauds as a prisoner,\" says Smith, \"about six months; but notwithstanding their deter mination to destroy me, with the rest of my brethren who were with me, and although at three different times we were sentenced to be shot without the least shadow of law, and had the time and place appointed for that purpose, yet through the mercy of God, in answer to the prayers of the saints, I have been preserved, and delivered out of their hands.\"47 '\"' In 1839 Carlin was governor of Illinois, and on him the governor of Missouri made a formal demand for the surrender to the authorities of Smith and Rigdon, but little attention was paid to it. One of the most complete documents extant covering this period is, Facts Relative to the Expulsion oj the Mormons, or Latter-day Saints, from the State of Missouri under the Ex terminating Order.

The work consists of 43 8vo pages, aud was written for the purpose of showing to what wrongs the Mormons had been subjected at the hands of the people and politicians of Missouri, and also to obtain contributions for the destitute. The contents are hugely documen tary, and if we allow for some intensity of feeling, bear the impress of truth.

Bishop Knight bought for the church part of the town of Keokuk, Iowa, situated on the west bank of the Mississippi, forty miles above Quincy, Illinois. He also purchased the whole of another town-site called Nashville, six miles above Keokuk.

This was purchased by the saints, with the lands sur rounding, and a town laid out which was named Nauvoo, \"from the Hebrew, which signifies fair, very beautiful, and it actually fills the definition of the word; for nature has not formed a parallel on the banks of the Mississippi from New Orleans to Ga lena.\" The post-office there was first called Com merce, after the Mormons had purchased the village, but the name was changed to that of Nauvoo in May, 1840.40 The place was started by a company from New York, but it was so sickly that when the agent for the Mormons came they were glad to sell. The Mormons drained it and made the place comparatively healthy. On his escape from prison, Smith visited Commerce among other places, and seeing at once the advan tages of its site, determined to establish there the headquarters of the church. For so great had his power now become, so extensive his following, that he might choose any spot whereon to call into existence a city, had but to point his finger and say the word to transform a wilderness into a garden. During the winter of 1840 the church leaders applied to the leg islature of Illinois for several charters, one for the city of Nauvoo, one for agricultural and manufactur ing purposes, one for a university, and one for a mili tary body called the Nauvoo Legion. The privileges asked were very extensive, but were readily granted; for the two great political parties were pretty equal in numbers in Illinois at this time, and the leaders of the party in office, perceiving what a political power these people were, determined to secure them. 19 ' Nauvoo was one of the names of one of .the numerous petty chiefs in British India.' Ferris' The Mor., 97. 'Nauvoo isa Hebrew word, and sig nifies a beautiful habitation for man, carrying with it the idea of rest; it is not, however, considered by the Mormons their final home, but a resting place only; for they only intend to remain there until they have gathered force sufficient to enable them to conquer Independence in Jackson co., Mis souri, which is one of the most fertile, pleasant, and desirable countries on the face of tho earth, possessing a soil unsurpassed in any region.

There were also many travelling preachers, men full of the holy ghost, or believing themselves so, who travelled without purse or scrip, whom no buffetings, insults, hunger, or blows could daunt, who feared nothing that man could do, heaven's door being always open to them. See now the effects of these persecutions in Missouri. Twelve thousand were driven from their homes and set moving by Boggs and his gen erals; three fourths of them found new homes at Quincy, Nauvoo, and elsewhere; but three thousand, who, but for the persecutions, would have remained at home and tilled their lands, were preaching and proselyting, making new converts and astablishing new churches wherever they went. One of their number, William Smith, was a member of the Illi nois legislature. In the very midst of the war they were preaching in Jackson county, among their old enemies and spoilers, striving with all their souls to win back their Zion, their New Jerusalem. From New York, February 19, 1840, Brigham Young, H. C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, and Parley P. Pratt indited a letter to the saints at Commerce, speaking of the wonderful progress of the faith, and of their own in tended departure for England.60 Thus, despite persecution, the saints increased in number year by year. Before the end of 1840 there were fifteen thousand souls at Nauvoo, men, women, and children, not all of them exiles from Missouri, but from every quarter, old believers and new con verts from different parts of the United States, from Canada, and from Europe; hither came they to the city of their God, to the mountain of his holiness. ering place for all the saints, and in that delightful country they expect to find their Eden, and build the New Jerusalem.

Times and Sea- sons, iii. 936. A correspondent of the New York Herald is a little wild wher he writes about this time: 'The Mormons number in Europe and America about 150,000, and are constantly pouring into Nauvoo and the neighboring country. There are probably in and about this city and adjacent territories not far from 30,000.' Fifteen thousand in 1840 is the number given in Mackay's The Mormons, 115, as I mentioned in the last chapter. A corre- spondent's estimate in the Times and Seasons, in 1842, was for the city 7,000, and for the immediate surroundings 3,000. Phelps, in T/te Prophet, estimates the population during the height of the city's prosperity in 1844 at 14,000, of whom nine tenths were Mormons. Some 2000 houses were built the first year. Joseph Smith in Times and Seasons, March 1842, says: 'We number from six to eight thousand here, besides vast numbers in the county around, and in almost every county in the state.' 4 The structure was 83 by 128 feet, and 60 feet high. The stone was quar- ried within city limits. There was an upper story and basement; and in the latter a baptismal font wrought after the manner of King Solomon's brazen sea. A huge tank, upon whose panels were painted various scenes, and ascent to which was made by stairs, was upborne by twelve oxen, beautifully carved Qnd overlaid with gold. 'The two great stories,' says a Mormon eye- witness, 'each have two pulpits, one at each end, to accommodate the Mcl- chizedek and Aaronic priesthoods, graded into four rising seats, the first for the president of the elders and his two counsellors, the second for the president of the high priesthood and his two counsellors, and the third for the Melchizedek president and his two counsellors, and the fourth for the presi dent of the whole church and his two counsellors. There are thirty hewn stone pilasters which cost about $3,000 apiece. The base is a crescent new moon; the capitals, near 50 feet high; the sun, with a human face in bold re- lief, about two and a half feet broad, ornamented with rays of light and waves, surmounted by two hands holding two trumpets.'

Their relig ion is a peculiar one; that is, neither Buddhism, nor Mahometanism, nor Judaism, nor Christianity, but it is a faith which they say encourages no vice nor immorality, nor departure from established laws and usages; neither polygamy, nor promiscuous intercourse, nor community of property ... Ar dent spirits as a drink are not in use among them. . .Tobacco, also, is a weed which they seem almost universally to despise. We don't know but that the Mormons ought to be expatriated for refusing to drink whiskey and chew tobacco; but we hope the question will not be decided hastily, nor until their judges have slept off the fumes of their own liquor and cigars.' 'They have enclosed large farms on the prairie ground, on which they have raised corn, wheat, hemp, etc., and all this they have accomplished within the short space of four years. I do not believe there is another people in existence who could have made such improvements in the same length of time under the same circumstances. And here allow me to remark, that there are some here who have lately emigrated to this place, who have built themselves large and convenient homes in the town; others on their farms on the prairie, who, if they had remained at home, might have continued to live in rented houses all their days, and never once have entertained the idea of building one for themselves at their own expense.' Smucker's Mormonism, 159. 9 Gentiles were not excluded from the holy city. In Bennett's Hist. Saints, 158, is given an ordinance, dated March 1, 1841, running as follows: 'Be it ordained by the city council of the city of Nauvoo, that the catholics, pres byterians, methodists, baptists, latter-day saints, quakers, episcopalians, universahsts, Unitarians, mohammedans, and all other religious sects and de nominations whatever, shall have toleration and equal privileges in this oity;"], [203, "THEY CATCH AN EEL. 149 enjoy our society, as they say.\" \"They are a wonder fully enterprising people,\" writes a gentile. \"Peace and harmony reign in the city. The drunkard is scarcely ever seen, as in other cities, neither does the awful imprecation or profane oath strike upon your ear; but while all is storm and tempest and confusion abroad respecting the Mormons, all is peace and har mony at home.\"10 About this time there comes to Joseph Smith a somewhat singular individual making somewhat singu lar advances. He is a yankee huckster of the first class, only for his merchandise, instead of patent clocks and wooden nutmegs, he offers for sale theol ogy, medicine, and a general assortment of political and military wares. The thing is a fraud, and be fore long he openly announces himself as such. As his manhood is far inferior to his duplicity, so his name \u2014 the Reverend General John C. Bennett, M. D., U. S. A., president, chancellor, and master in chancery \u2014 as we may observe, is subordinate to his titles. He has ability, he has brains and fingers ; but and should any person be guilty of ridiculing, abusing, or otherwise depre ciating another in consequence of his religion, etc., he shall be fined and imprisoned.' On the 17th of March, 1842, the Female Relief Society of Nau voo was organized. 10 In the Salem Advertiser was published an account of the visit to Nauvoo in 1843 of one Newhall, a lecturer, who says: 'I sought in vain for anything that bore the marks of immorality, but was both astonished and highly pleased at my ill success. I could see no loungers about the streets nor any drunk ards about the taverns. I did not meet with those distorted features of ruf fians, or with the ill-bred and impudent. I heard not an oath in the place, I saw not a gloomy countenance; all were cheerful, polite, and industrious.' Smucker's Mormons, 154-5. 'The mayor of Nauvoo deserves praise for the stand he has taken in favor of temperance. The retailing of ardent spirits is not permitted within the bounds of the corporation.' Kidder's Mormons, 189. For city ordinance prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors in less quantity than a quart except as a physician's prescription, see Bennett's Hist. Saints, 27. On the 12th of Nov. 1841, B. Winchester writes from Nauvoo: 'You would be astonished, if you were here, at the vast improvement made in so short a space of time. . .You will see nothing like idleness, but will hear the hum of industry, nay, may I not say more, the voice of merriment. ..Now as to the morality of the people here: . . .you know if you should throw cold water into melted iron tke scene would be terrific, because the contrast would be so great; so it is with the saints: if a small portion of wickedness happens among them, the contrast between the spirit of Christ and that of darkness is so great that it makes a great upstir and tremendous excitement ; this is the case here; but in other communities the same amount of crime would hardly be noticed.

He professes all that the Mormons profess, and more; he does all that the Mormons do, and more. So the prophet makes him general of his legion, mayor of the city, chancellor of the university, not to mention his func tions as attorney, doctor, and privy counsellor. All this is done with quick despatch; and tho result is that the great man soon tires of his greatness, or thinks to become yet greater by turning rene gade, and writing a book against his late friends and associates.11 11 Representative of a class of anti-Mormon literature, not altogether creditable to either its authors or supporters, are the following: The History of the Saints; or, An Expose: of Joe Smith and Mormonism.

(St Louis. 1S77.) The role of traitor is not one which in any wise brings credit to the performer, either from one side or the other. However great the service he may render us, we cannot but feel that he is false-hearted and vile. Many of the apostates, though they may not have written books, declare that they joined the sect only to learn their secrets and then expose them. These are the most contemptible of all. There may be cases where a young or inex perienced person, through ignorance or susceptibility, has been carried away for a time contrary to the dictates of cooler judgment; but the statements of such persons are justly regarded with more or less suspicion. Far better is it, far more honest and praiseworthy, for him who, having unwittingly made a mistake, seeks to rectify it, to go his way and say nothing about it; for if he talks of writing a book for the good of others, as a warning, and that they may avoid his errors, few will believe him. ' If he has proved traitor once,' they say, 'he will deceive again; and if he is sincere, we cannot more than half believe him, for such an individual is never sure of himself.' John C Bennett, general, doctor, methodist preacher, and quack, is from his own showing a bad man. He devotes some fifty pages to the vindication of his character, which would not be necessary were he honest; other fifty are given to defaming his late worshipful patron Joseph Smith, which would never have been written were he true. When a man thrusts in your face three-score certificates of his good character, each signed by from one to a dozen persons, you may know that he is a very great rascal. Nor are we disappointed here This author is a charlatan, pure and simple; such was he when he joined the Mormons, and before and after. We may credit him fully when he says, ' I never believed in them or their doctrines;' although m a letter to Dr Dyer, dated Nauvoo, Jan. 20, 1842, he declares: ' My heart is"], [205, "SPECIMENS OF LITERATURE. 151 There is another individual of similar name, and yet more similar character, James Arlington Ben- filled with indignation, and my blood boils within me, when I contemplate the vast injustice and cruelty which Missouri has meted out to the great philanthropist and devout Christian, General Joseph Smith, and hi3 honest and faithful adherents. ' When, however, he affects patriotism and lofty devo tion to the welfare of his fellow-men, pretending to have joined the society in order to frustrate 'a daring and colossal scheme of rebellion and usurpa tion throughout the north-western states, ... a despotic military and religious empire, the head of which, as emperor and pope, was to be Joseph Smith,' we know that the writer is well aware that it is all nonsense. Nor do we be lieve that he was induced to print his book ' by a desire to expose the enor mous iniquities which have been perpetrated by one of tho grossest and most infamous impostors that ever appeared upon the face of the earth.' We have heard and are still hearing so much of that kind of talk from some of the worst men in the community that it is becoming somewhat stale, and if the general really does not know better than, this why he wrote his book, perhaps he will excuse me for telling him that it was, first, for notoriety; sec ond, for money; and third, in order to make people think him a better and greater man than he is. When a man's ambition is pitched so low, it is a pity that he should not have the gratification of success. Bravely, then, the general proceeded to offer himself on the altar of his country, 'to overthrow the impostor and expose his iniquity ' by ' professing himself a convert to his doctrines;' for 'the fruition of his hopeful project would, of course, have been preceded by plunder, devastation, and bloodshed, and by all the count less horrors which in variably accompany civil war. ' We are still more im pressed when we read: 'I was quite aware of the danger I ran'\u2014 that of being kicked out of some back door \u2014 'but none of these things deterred me.' Without wasting more time and space upon the man, we are well enough pre pared to place a proper estimate upon his statements, particularly when we take into account that, in May of the very year in which his book was pub lished, he went before Alderman Wells and made affidavit that Joseph Smith was an honest, virtuous, sincere, high-minded, and patriotic man. He says himself that he solemnly swore to be true to the Mormons and not reveal their secrets, and now in breaking that oath he has the audacity to ask us to regard him as an honest and truthful man! In some measure, at least, the statements of such men as this, taken up by the press and people, and reiter ated throughout the land, have given the latter-day saints a worse name than they deserve. Some of his charges are too coarse and filthy for repe tition. I will cite a few specimens, however, to show how far mendacity is sometimes carried in this direction. Joseph Smith is a 'monster who is using the power he possesses to gratily a brutal lust;' 'a Giovanni of some dozens of mistresses;' 'must bo branded as a consummate knave;' one 'of the most heaven-daring liars the world ever saw;' 'notoriously profane;' 'gets most gloriously drunk,' etc. In toe most vulgar and licentious language, -he goes on to describe what he calls the Mor mon seraglio,' 'the female inquisition,' 'Joe's cloistered, chambered, and cy priau maids.' He revels in all the wickedness of this kind during past ages which he can make up, rolling it as a sweet morsel under his tongue, finally affirming that ' the holy Joe outdoes them all 1' He says that any woman be longing to the society who lapses from virtue is condemned to a life ot se cret prostitution, the most trustworthy members of the church having knowl edge of it; another class indulge in illicit intercourse by special permission ot the prophet; another class are the spiritual wives. All this is said, be it re membered, within two or three months of the time he made oath that Smith was one of the best and purest of men. Next comes an expose of several se cret societies, the Danites, Destroying Angel, etc., and finally a list ot mur ders and robberies perpetrated in that section during a certain time, all ol"], [206, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 152 nett, also called general, whom Mackay, Smucker, a reviewer in the Edinburgh, and others have tnis- which are charged to these agencies. Sidney Rigdon is praised by Bennett: so much the worse for Sidney. Doubtless this book played its part in bring- ing about the assassination of Joseph Smith. Says John Taylor of John C. Bennett: 'At one time he was a good man, but fell into adultery, and was cut off from the church for his iniquity;. . .lie was also expelled from the mu- nicipal court, of which he was a member. ' Public Discussion, 5-6. William Hall was an old gentleman of simple mind and manners when he wrote lii3 book; he appears to be earnest and truthful. As he says of the saints, so I should say of him: he meant well, but he should beware of bad leaders. Hall was not a great man in the church, like Bennett; nevertheless, like Bennett he wrote a book, but unlike Bennett's, his book reads like that of an honest man, although it is full of bitter accusations against the Mor- mons. All such works should be taken with some degrees of allowance; for when a person begins to rail against any people or individual, he is apt to be carried away and misrepresent, intentionally or unintentionally. The period that Hall's experiences cover is.quitean important one, including as it does the Illinois expulsion and the exodus to Great Salt Lake. Quite different from any of his brother apostates is John Hyde, Jr, who cannot by right be placed in the category of vulgar ranter or hypocritical re- former. I regard him as an able and honest man, sober and sincere. He does not denounce the sect as hypocrites. ' I know your sincerity; I know also your delusion,' he writes. He does not even denounce all tho leaders; even to Brigham Young, whom he mercilessly scourges, he gives credit for ability and sincerity. 'That you are sincere in your confidence in Joseph Smith, and in your own pretensions,' he writes to him, 'I believe and ac- knowledge; but at the same time, that you are leading confiding thousands to misery and ruin is evident. . I admire your genius, but I deplore its exercise. ... I admire the industry of your people, their notable labors, and their general sincerity; but I deplore their delusion, and I denounce their deceivers.' Hi? book is dedicated 'To the honest believers in Mormonism, ' and he says to them: 'In writing the following work I was not actuated by the base design of helping to malign an unpopular people, nor by the unworthy one of ad- ministering to a mere idle curiosity.' John Hyde was born in England, in 1833, and joined the Mormons there when fifteen years of age. He was al- most immediately ordained a priest and began to preach. In 1851 he was ordained oue of the seventies, an office of equal power but inferior jurisdic- tion to that ot one of the twelve, and joined John Taylor iu France. With about 400 Mormon converts he sailed from Liverpool in Feb. 1S53, visited Nau- voo, and thence crossed the plains in company with 2,500 brethren to Salt Lake City, where he married and began teaching school. In Feb. 1854 he was 'in- itiated into the mysteries of the Mormon endowment, ' became shaken in the faith, and the following year, having accepted a mission to the Hawaiian Isl- ands, he threw off Mormonism and preached and wrote against it instead of for it. In his book he gives a description of Salt Lake City in lS53^t, a chap- ter entitled 'Practical Polygamy, ' and others on Mormon Mysteries, Educa- tion, Brigham Young, Book of Mormon, Theoretical Polygamy, and Sup- pression of Mormonism. Hyde's book would be quite useful were he not so loose about his dates; it would appear from the way he throws statements together that in the absence of a date he guessed at it. Still another style of book is that of John D. Lee, purporting to have wnwVrt^ten by hlm' bufc as a matter of fact written for the most part by VV . W. Bishop while Lee was in prison condemned to death. The work, there fore, though the story of a Mormon, and of one who under the circumstances could not be expected to be very friendly, is not by a Mormon. The book is not essentially different from the matter published in the newspapers about the time of Lee s execution, under the title of ' Confessions.' Lee gives the"], [207, "SOCIAL CONDITIONS. 153 taken for the original. The quality of impudence appears as fully in the second Bennett as in the first.12 As I have before observed, the misfortunes of the saints by no means dampened their ardor, or impov erished them as a society. Some lost their all; in that case the others helped them. Old scores were story of his life, simply and honestly enough; to this is added an account of the Mountain Meadow massacre, and of the arrest, trial, and exeoution of Lee. He was a native of Illinois, born in 1812, worked hard and with suc cess while a young man, became an enthusiastic Mormon in 1837, and went to Missouri. With everything there he was highly delighted; he attended devoutly all the services of the church, and was duly promoted. He was with his people at Nauvoo, migrated with them to Utah, and was adopted by Brigham Young. In 1877 he was executed for participation in the Moun tain Meadow massacre, excusing himself while cursing others. Mormonism and the Mormons; A Historical View of the rise and progress of the sect self-styled Latter-day Saints; by Daniel P. Kidder, is the title of a 16mo vol. of 342 pages, published in New York, and bearing no date, though entered for copyright in tho year 1842. Mr Kidder certainly wrote a book on short acquaintance with the subject; as he says up to Nov. 1840, he knew little about it. On the 13th of that month he found himself on board a Mormon steamboat called the Fulton City, on the Mississippi River, bound for Nauvoo. Nearly all the passengers and crew were Mormons. Desirous of knowing more of them, and holding to the maxim that by teach ing most i3 to be learned, he procured copies of the Book of Mormon, Doc trine and Covenants, Howe's Mormonism Unveiled, and Corrill' s Brief His tory, and seating himself before them made his book, which consists chiefly of extracts from the above sources tied together with occasional remarks neither startling nor original. In Nauvoo, without date, but probably about 1 84 1 , were published two chapters of nonsense about women and their relations and duties to men, entitled, An Extract from a Manuscript entitled The Peace-maker, or the Doctrines of the Millennium, being a Treatise on Religion and Jurisprudence, or a New System of Religion and Politics. For God, my Country, and my Rights. By Adney Hay Jacob, an Israelite, and a Shepherd of Israel. Nauvoo, III. J. Smith, Printer. In a preface the reader is told: ' The author of this work is not a Mormon, although it is printed by their press. ' \"In a letter to the prophet dated October 24, 1843, which has become quite famous, James A. Bennett pretends to have been baptized by Brigham Young, a ceremony that he alludes to as 'a glorious frolic in the clear blue ocean' with 'your most excellent and worthy friend, President B. Young.' 'Nothing of this kind,' he goes on to say, 'would in the least_ attach me to your person or cause. I am capable of being a most undeviating friend, without being governed by the smallest religious influence . . .1 say, therefore go ahead you have my good wishes. You know Mahomet had his right-hand man.'etc. Smith replied at length in a religio-philosophic stram. More has been made of this correspondence than it deserves.

See also Edinburgh Review, April 1854, 334. Mackay observes: 'Joseph s re ply to this singular and too candid epistle was quite as singular and infinitely more amusing. Joseph was too cunning a man to accept, in plain terms, the rude but serviceable offer; and he rebuked the vanity and presumption of Mr Bennett, while dexterously retaining him for future use.

Head over all, temporal and spiritual, was Joseph Smith, not only prophet and president, but general and mayor.14 He had now approached the summit of his career, and for a brief space was permitted to enjoy his fame, wealth, and power in some degree of quiet. They were salutary lessons that the prophet and his people had received in Missouri, and for a time their speech and manner were less arrogant than of old. But soon prosperity was far greater here than ever before, and as with Israel of old the chastise ments of the Lord were soon forgotten. From the moment they crossed the river from Missouri into Illinois their position as men and members of the commonwealth was changed. In the one state they were regarded as fanatics, dangerous to the govern ment and to the people, having associated assassins to do their bidding, and holding to a doctrine of divine inheritance with regard to all that country; in the \" 'At the conference in April 1840, the prophet delivered a lengthy ad dress upon the history and condition of the saints. He reminded the breth ren that all had suffered alike for the sake of the gospel. The rich and the poor had been brought to a common level by persecution; that many of the brethren were owing debts that they had been forced to contract in order to get out of Missouri alive. He considered it was unchristian-like for the brethren to demand the payment of such debts; that he did not wish to screen any one from the just payment of his debts, but he did think that it would be for the glory of the kingdom if the people would, of their own will, freely forgive each other for all their existing indebtedness, one to the other, then renew their covenants with almighty God and with each other; refrain from evil, and live their religion; by this means, God's holy spirit would sup port and bless the people. The people were then asked if they were in favor of thus bringing about the year of jubilee. All that felt so inclined were asked to make it known by raising their hands; every hand in the audience was raised.' The prophet then declared all debts of the saints, to and from each other, forgiven and cancelled. He then gave the following words of advice to the people: 'I wish you all to know that because you were justified in taking property from your enemies while engaged in war in Missouri, which was needed to support you, there is now a diiferent condition of things existing. We are no longer at war, and you must stop stealing. When the right time comes we will go in force and take the whole state of Missouri. It belongs to us as an inheritance; but I want no more petty stealing.' Lee's Mormonism, 110-11. \"Smith was first mayor.

Such was their past and present status in the com munity. They were now treated, politically and socially, with consideration, especially by politicians. Thomas Carlin, governor of Illinois, was their friend, and granted them all the privileges they asked; Rob ert Lucas, governor of Iowa, was their friend, and promised them the protection due to every citizen of the United States, of whatsoever religion, creed, superstition, fanaticism, craze, or whatever people might choose to call it. But soon there came a governor, named Thomas Ford, who knew not Joseph. He was a well meaning man enough, not blood-thirsty like Boggs, nor strong and cool-headed like Carlin, nor yet a man of positive action and opinion like Lucas; still, Ford was not a bad man, and if the saints had conducted themselves according to the wisdom of the world, they might in time, perhaps, have overcome the prejudices of the people. But prosperity seemed as fatal to them as adversity was profitable. All the best of heaven and earth was now theirs, and again Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked, revelations becoming less frequent as the cares of this world, the lusts of the flesh, and the pride of life crept in among the people.

The counties surrounding Hancock, in which was Nau voo, were fearful of the prosperity of the saints, and of their political influence; there were angry words and bickerings between the opposing societies, and then blows. The old Missouri feud was kept alive by suits instituted against Smith and others.16 An attempt made to assassinate Governor Boggs was, of course, charged to the Mormons, and probably with truth. In fact, if we may believe their enemies, they did not deny it. Boggs had unlawfully ordered all the Mor mons in Missouri killed if they did not leave the state: why had not they the same right, they argued, to break the law and kill him?17 Among the reports circulated, besides those of assassination and attempted assassination, the follow ing will serve as specimens: That the plan of Smith 16 When on his return from Quincy, to which place he had accompanied Hyrum Smith and William Law, who were on a mission to the east, Joseph was arrested the 5th of June, 1S41, on a warrant from Gov. Carlin to deliver him to the Missouri state authorities. In return, Joseph Smith brought suit against J. H. Reynolds and H. G. Wilson for false imprisonment. This as well as other affairs of the kind kept up a bitter excitement. \"On the 6th of May, 1S42, Gov. Boggs was fired at through a window, and narrowly escaped being killed. The crime was charged to O. P. Rock well, ' with the connivance and under the instructions of Joseph Smith. ' Hyde's Mormonism, 105, 206. Boggs swore he believed Smith a party to the at tempted assassination, and instituted legal proceedings. Mackay's The Mor mons, 139. Bennett, Hist. Saints, 2S1-2, labors hard to prove that Smith wanted Boggs killed, and said as much, which it seems to me few would deny. Bennett states that in 1841 Smith prophesied that Boggs would die by violent hands within a year. ' In the spring of the year 1 842 Smith offered a reward of $500 to any man who would secretly assassinate Gov. Boggs. ' Joseph O. Boggs, brother of the governor, writes Bennett, Sept. 12, 1842, 'We have now no doubt of the guilt of Smith and Rockwell. ' Id. , 286. Rockwell was arrested, discharged, and went to Utah.

In an address to the saints at Nauvoo, September 1, 1842, Joseph stated that on account of the enemies in pursuit of him, both in Missouri and in Illinois, he deemed it best to retire for a time, and seek safety.16 He ordered his debts paid as they fell due, his prop erty to be sold if necessary to meet requirements, and exhorted all officers to be faithful to their trust. \"When the storm is past I will return,\" he said; \"and as for perils, they seem small things to me, for the envy and wrath of man have been my common lot all the days of my life.\" And again: \"Verily thus saith the Lord, let the work of my temple, and all the works which I have appointed unto you, be continued and not cease. Let all the records be had in order, that they may be put in the archives of my holy temple. I will write the word of the Lord from time to time and send it to you by mail. I now close my letter for the present, for the want of more time, for the enemy is on the alert; and as the savior said, the prince of this world cometh, but he hath nothing in me.\" Five days later the prophet sent an address to the saints, mainly touching the baptism for the dead, of which more hereafter. \"Now what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A voice of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven ; and a voice of truth out of the earth, glad tidings for the dead ; a voice of gladness for the living and dead ; glad tidings of great joy.

Twenty years had passed since the plates of Mor mon had been revealed to Joseph, during which time he had suffered divers and continued persecution. He and his followers had been reviled and spit upon from the beginning; some of them had been robbed, and beaten, hunted down, imprisoned, and slain. Yet they had prospered; the church had rapidly increased, and its members were blessed with plenty. Their neighbors spoke much evil of them and com mitted many violent acts. The saints were exceed ingly annoying; they voted solid and claimed the whole world as theirs, including Jackson county, Missouri ; they were wild in their thoughts, extrava gant in their pretensions, and by no means temperate in the use of their tongues; they were not always prudent; they were not always without reproach.

The evidence comes to us in the form of rumors, general assertions, and bold statements from the mouths 'of men filled with deadly hate, and cannot be altogether trusted. Some of these have said that the leaders of the church, finding their power over the minds and bodies of their female associ ates so greatly increased, so rapidly becoming abso lute, could not resist temptation, but fell into grievous sins like Jeroboam and David, and were thereby obliged to adopt some plan either to cover or make right their conduct. It was easy for the gentiles to make such a charge appear plausible, in view of the fact that about this time the doctrine of plurality of wives as prac tised and promulgated in the scriptures attracted much attention. Most of the other acts, customs, and ordinances ff the old and new testaments had been adopted in common with those contained in the book of Mormon by the latter-day church; why should not this? Wives and concubines without re striction had been permitted to the worthy men of old; the holy scriptures had nowhere condemned the custom; God had at no time ordered otherwise. On the contrary, it seemed in the line of example anil duty; it seemed necessary to make the holy fabric symmetrical and complete. True, it was not now in vogue with either Jews or Christians; but neither were miracles nor special revelations. Surely, if God disapproved, he would have so declared; his com mands he makes clear; particularly acts heinous in his sight he denounces loudly and with many repetitions. Thus argued the elders. They did not consider, nor indeed care for, the fact that, viewed from the stand point of intellectual progress, the revival of polygamy, or concubinage, in common with other practices of the half-savage Hebrews, was a retrogression, a turn ing back toward savagism. They found it sanctioned in the holy book in use by the most civilized nations of the earth, and they felt themselves able to make"], [214, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 160 it appear plausible. If any had the right to adopt part of the bible as their rule of conduct, accepting it all as true, they claimed the right to adopt the whole of it for their rule of conduct if they chose. It was civil ization, and not the holy scriptures, that forbade polygamy, and they cared very little comparative!} for civilization. Finally, on the 12th of July, 1843, while the chief men of the church were thinking the matter over, though saying little even among themselves, it is stated that there came to Joseph a revelation, the last of the prophet's revelations of which there is any record. \"Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you have inquired of my hand to know and understand wherein I, the Lord, justified my servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; as also Moses, David, and Solomon, my servants, as touch ing the principles and doctrine of their having many wives and concubines: Behold! and lo, I am the Lord thy God, and will answer thee, as touching this matter. \"Abraham received concubines, and they bare him children, and it was accounted unto him for righteous ness, because they were given unto him, and he abode in my law; as Isaac also, and Jacob, did none other things than that which they were commanded. David also received many wives and concubines, as also Solomon, and Moses, my servant, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time, and in nothing did they sin, save in those things which they received not of me. \"David's wives and concubines were given unto him of me by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me, save in the case of Uriah and his wife : and, therefore, he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord."], [215, "EMMA EXHORTED. 161 \"Verily, I say unto you, a commandment I give unto mine handmaid, Emma Smith, your wife, whom I have given unto you, that she stay herself, and par take not of that which I commanded you to offer unto her; for I did it, saith the Lord, to prove you all, as I did Abraham, and that I might require an offer ing at your hand by convenant and sacrifice; and let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me. \"And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. And again, verily, I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses, and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she hath trespassed against me; and I, the Lord thy God, will bless her and multiply her, and make her heart to re- joice. \"And again, as pertaining to the law of the priest- hood: if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent; and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then he is justified; he can- not commit adultery, for they are given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that belonging unto him, and to none else; and if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law he cannot commit adultery, for they belong to him, and they are given unto him ; therefore he is justified.\" It is said that as early as 1831 the will of the Lord in this respect had been revealed to Joseph. In translating the bible he had come upon the passages relating to plural wives and concubines, and had in- quired of the Lord what he should do. He was told to wait, and not make the matter public then, the peo- ple not yet having faith to receive it. It was one of the severest trials the church had yet been called upon to undergo, and the wisest circumspection was neces sary lest Joseph should be repudiated by his followers Hibt.

In 1841 Joseph began to take to himself plural wives, and his example was followed by some of the others. Finally, in order that all might know that he was not acting on his own responsibility alone, the revelation came, sanctioning and enforcing the system. This, as I have given it, is the orthodox and authorized ex planation of the matter. Thus came to the saints the doctrine of polygamy, first to the leaders and for a time kept secret, and finally to the whole church, as one of its most prom inent tenets.18 For years it was known only to a few, and it was not formally promulgated until after the great exodus, when the church had become well es tablished in the valleys of the Yutas.19 There were several reasons for adopting this course. First, the hate and obloquy which would be engendered by its publication, and the wide-spread and bitter oppo sition it would meet. The work of missionaries in the field would greatly suffer. Many in the church would oppose it; women would rebel, while their sisters throughout Christendom would hold them in derision. It was all so new and strange. Even in theory it was startling enough; but put it in practice, and who could foretell the result? The very foundations of 16 John Hyde mentions a previous revelation. He says that about the year 1838 'Smith pretended to obtain a revelation from God authorizing him to practise polygamy, and began to practise it accordingly.' Mormonism, 203. See also Slater's Mormonism, 84, and Deseret News, Oct. 22, 1879. There is no truth whatever in this assertion. And yet John Hyde is regarded as pretty good authority; but in this loose way thousands of false statements have been made regarding the secrets of the saints. \"This revelation was first published in the Deseret News in 1852, and next in the Millennial Star at Liverpool, England, in 1853. It is given entire else where in this volume. The Edinburgh Review of April 1854,335, says, 'Not many months have yet passed since the Mormon leaders have decided on a bolder policy and have publicly avowed this portion of the system,' which shows that the fact of publication was not generally known to the gentile Euro pean world until two years after the official notice in Salt Lake City appeared.

If it must needs be, then let discretion be used. Let the mat ter be broken to the church as it is able to receive it; let the system be introduced gradually, and practised secretly; by the chief men at first, and later by all.20 It was indeed a heavy load that the saints thus took upon themselves, willingly or unwillingly, in the ser vice of God or in the service of Satan. Up to this 20 It is denied by some that polygamy was practised by the Mormons at this date. In the Deseret News of Oct. 22, 1879, are several statements under oath to the effect that between 1S40 and 1843 Joseph taught the doctrine of celestial or plural marriage, that several women were sealed to him according to this doctrine, and this with the consent of Joseph's wife, Emma Smith. On the other hand, it is stated in the Salt Lake City Tribune, Oct. 3, 1879, that Emma denied that her husband was ever married to another, or that, so far as she knew, he ever had improper relations with any woman. Elder Pratt reported at Piano, 111., in the summer of 1878, several instances of Joseph's having had wives sealed to him, oneat least asearlyas April 5, 1841. 'Smith introduced (at Nauvoo) the system of spiritual wifeism, and had largely in- creased his household by celestial ensealment. This was the preliminary step of polygamy, or its practical adoption, though it had not yet been revealed as a tenet in the Mormon creed. ' Tucker's Mormonism, 170. The revelation was written after he had taken other wives. Slenhouse's Exposed of Poli/gamy, 70. Jos. Smith adopts it and is sealed to Eliza Snow. Tullidge's Life of Young, Suppl. 22. In a letter to the Deseret News, Oct. 22, 1879, Eliza R. Snow signs her name as 'a wife of Joseph Smith the prophet.' 'Brigham Young delivered over to Jo Smith all his wives except one, and soon after Smith had a revelation that Young should be his successor as head of the church.' Slater's Mormonism, 84. John D. Lee says: 'I understood that Brig. Young's wife was sealed to Joseph. After his death Brig. Young told me that Joseph's time on earth was short, and that the Lord allowed him privileges that we could not have.' Mormonism, 147. Jos. Smith had taken some more wives, but the revelation required that he should do it without publicity (for fear of the mob). Richards' Reminiscences, MS., 18. 'Joseph Smith lost his life entirely through attempting to persuade a Mrs Dr Foster, at Nauvoo, that it was the will of God she should become his spiritual wife; not to the exclusion of her husband, Dr Foster, but only to become his in time for eternity. This nefarious offer she confessed to her husband. Some others of a similar nature were discovered, and Dr Foster, William Law, and others began to expose Smith. Their paper was burned, typo and press de- molished, for which Smith was arrested, and afterward shot by Missourians, at Carthage, 111. ' Hyde's Mormonism, 85. ' Smith and Noble repaired by night to the banks of the Mississippi, where Noble's sister was sealed to Smith by Noble, and the latter to another woman by Smith.

' That polyg amy existed at Nauvoo, and is now a matter scarcely attempted to be con cealed among the Mormons, is certain.' Gunnison's Mormons, 120. On the other side, in Times and Seasons, iv. 143 (March 15, 1843), we read, 'The charge of advocating a plurality of wives is as false as the many other ridicu lous charges brought against us.' In Id., v. 474 (March 15, 1844), Hyrum Smith declares that no such doctrine is taught or practised; and on p. 715 it is declared that 'the law of tho land and the rules of tho church do not allow one man to have more than one wife alive at once.'

They were stronger than their immediate neighbors \u2014 stronger socially, politically, and indus trially ; and the people about them felt this, and while hating, feared them. It is true, that on their first arrival in Zion they were not wealthy ; neither were their neighbors. They were not highly educated or refined or cultured; neither were their neighbors. They were sometimes loud and vulgar of speech ; so were their neighbors. Immorality cropped out in certain quarters; so it did among the ancient Corinthians and the men of mod ern Missouri; there was some thieving among them; but they were no more immoral or dishonest than their persecutors who made war on them, and as they thought without a shadow of right. There is no doubt that among the Mormons as among the gentiles, perhaps among the Mormon leaders as among the gentile leaders, fornication and adultery were practised. It has been so in other ages and nations, in every age and nation; it is so now, and is likely to be so till the end of the world. But when the testimony on both sides is carefully weighed, it must be admitted that the Mormons in Missouri and Illinois were, as a class, a more moral, honest, temperate, hard-working, self-denying, and thrifty people than the gentiles by whom they were sur rounded. Says John D. Lee on entering the Mis souri fraternity and, at the time of this remarking, by no means friendly to the saints, \"The motives of the people who composed my neighborhood were pure; th,ey were all sincere in their devotions, and tried to square their actions through life by the golden rule . . ."], [219, "POLYGAMY A BURDEN AND A BOND. 165 The word of a Mormon was then good for all it was pledged to or for. I was proud to be an associate with such honorable people.\" And thus Colonel Kane, a disinterested observer, and not a Mormon : As compared with the other \"border inhabitants of Missouri, the vile scum which our society, like the great ocean, washes upon its frontier shores,\" the saints were \"persons of refined and cleanly habits and decent language.\" Nevertheless the sins of the entire section must be visited on them. Were there any robberies for miles around, they were charged by their enemies upon the Mormons; were there any house-burnings or assas sinations anywhere among the gentiles, it was the Danites who did it. Of all that has been laid at their door I find little proved against them. The charges are general, and preferred for the most part by irre sponsible men; in answer to them they refer us to the records. On the other hand, the outrages of their enemies are easily followed; for they are not denied, but are rather gloried in by the perpetrators. To shoot a Mormon was indeed a distinction coveted by the average gentile citizen of Illinois and Missouri, and was no more regarded as a crime than the shoot ing of a Blackfoot or Pawnee. Of course the Mor mons retaliated. Polygamy was a heavy load in one sense ; in another sense it was a bond of strength. While in the eyes of the world its open avowal placed the saints outside the pale of respectability, and made them amenable to the law, among themselves as law-breakers, openly defying the law, and placing themselves and their religion above all law, the very fact of being thus legal offenders, subject to the penalties and punish ments of the law, brought the members of the society so acting into closer relationship, cementing them as a sect, and making them more dependent on each other and on their leaders. It is plain that while thus bringing upon themselves ignominy and reproach,"], [220, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 166 while laying themselves open to the charge of being law-breakers, and assuming an attitude of defiance toward the laws and institutions of the country in which they lived, this bond of sympathy, of crim inality if you will, particularly when made a mat ter of conscience, when recognized as a mandate from the almighty, higher than any human law, and in whose obedience God himself was best pleased, and would surely afford protection, could but prove in the end a bond of strength, particularly if permitted to attain age and respectability among themselves, and assume the form of a concrete principle and of sacred obligation. If instead of falling back upon the teachings of the old testament, and adopting the questionable practices of the half-civilized Jews; if instead of taking for their models Abraham, David, and Solomon, the saints at Nauvoo had followed the advice of Paul to the saints at Ephesus, putting away fornication and all unclean ness, and walking worthy of their vocation, in all lowliness and meekness, as children of light, they would probably have remained in their beautiful city, and come into the inheritance of their Missouri Zion as had been prophesied. Had they consulted more closely the signs of the times, had they been less orthodox in their creed, less patriarchal in their prac tices, less biblical in their tenets, less devoted in their doctrines \u2014 in a word, had they followed more closely the path of worldly wisdom, and, like opposing chris tian sects, tempered religion with civilization, giving up the worst parts of religion for the better parts of civilization, I should not now be writing their history, as one with the history of Utah. But now was brought upon them this overwhelming issue, which howsoever it accorded with ancient scrip ture teachings, and as they thought with the rights of man, was opposed to public sentiment, and to the conscience of all civilized nations.

During this period of probation the church deemed it advisable to deny the charge, notably by Elder Pratt in a public sermon, and also by Joseph Smith. \"Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been re- proached with the crime of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man should have one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again.\"21 In the Times and Seasons of February 1, 1844, we have a notice signed by Joseph and Hyrum Smith: \"As we have lately been credibly informed that an elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, by the name of Hiram Brown, has been preaching polygamy and other false and corrupt doc trines in the county of Lapeer, state of Michigan, this is to notify him and the church in general that he has been cut of from the church for his iniquity.\" Notwithstanding these solemn denials and denun ciations in high places, the revelation and the prac tices which it sanctioned were not easily concealed.22 As yet, however, the calumny of the gentiles and the bickering of the saints vexed not the soul of Jo seph. He was now in the zenith of his fame and power; his followers in Europe and America numbered 21 Doctrine and Covenants, app. 331. 22 'It is believed,' writes Governor Ford not long afterward to the Illinois legislature, 'that Joseph Smith had announced a revelation from heaven sanctioning polygamy, by some kind of spiritual-wife system, which I never could well understand; but at any rate, whereby a man was allowed one wife in pursuance of the laws of the country, and an indefinite number of others, to be enjoyed in some mystical and spiritual mode; and that he him self, and many of his followers, had practised upon the precepts of this revelation, by seducing a large number of women.'

Whether this was done for effect or in earnest is somewhat doubtful, for it appears that the prophet's head was a 'little turned about this time; but it is certain that the people of Illinois and Missouri believed him to be in earnest. Addressing letters to Clay and Calhoun, near the close of 1843, he asked each of them what would be his rule of action toward the Mormons as a people should he be elected to the presidency. The reply in both cases was non-com mittal and unsatisfactory;23 whereupon Joseph issues an address setting forth his views on the government and policy of the United States, and foreshadows his own policy, in which we find many excellent features and many absurdities. \"No honest man can doubt for a moment,\" he says, \" but the glory of American liberty is on the wane; and that calamity and con fusion will sooner or later destroy the peace of the people.

Suits of this kind brought by the brethren against each other, but more particularly by the leaders against high officials, were pending in the Nauvoo municipal court for over two years. Early in June 1844 was issued the first number of the Nauvoo Expositor, the publishers being apostate Mormons and gentiles.28 The primary object of the publication was to stir up strife in the church, and aid its enemies in their work of attempted extermina tion. Its columns were at once filled with foul abuse of the prophet and certain elders of the church, assailing their character by means of affidavits, and charging them with all manner of public and private crimes, and abusing and misrepresenting the people.

It was a proceeding not at all to the taste of the Mormons that their mayor should be summoned for misdemeanor before the magistrate of another town, and Smith refused to go. He was willing to be tried before a state tribunal. Meanwhile the offenders were brought before the municipal court of Nauvoo, on a writ of habeas corpus, and after examination were discharged. The cry was then raised through out the country that Joseph Smith and associates, pub lic offenders, ensconced among their troops in the stronghold of Nauvoo, defied the law, refusing to re spond to the call of justice; whereupon the men of Illinois, to the number of two or three thousand, some coming even from Missouri, rallied to the support of the Carthage constable, and stood ready, as the}\" said, not only to arrest Joe Smith, but to burn his town and kill every man, woman, and child in it. As the forces of the enemy enlarged and grew yet more and more demonstrative in their wrath, the town prepared for defence, the Nauvoo Legion being called out and placed under arms, by instructions from Gov ernor Ford to Joseph Smith, as general in command. This gave rise to a report that they were about to make a raid on the neighboring gentile settlements.28 \"Letter of John S.

For this purpose public meetings had been called, inflammatory speeches had been made, exaggerated reports had been extensively circulated, committees had been appointed, who rode night and day to spread the reports and solicit the aid of neighboring counties, and at a public meeting at Warsaw resolutions were passed to expel or exterminate the Mormon population. This was not, however, a movement which was unanimously concurred in. The county contained a goodly num ber of inhabitants in favor of peace, or who at least desired to be neutral in such a contest. These were stigmatized by the name of Jack Mormons, and there were not a few of the more furious exciters of the people who openly expressed their intention to involve them in the common expulsion or extermination.\" Thomas Ford, governor of Illinois, was as a man rather above the average politician usually chosen among these American states to fill that position.

We lost no time in starting; but when we arrived at Carthage we could hear no more concerning this story. Again, during the few days that the militia were encamped at Carthage, frequent applications were made to me to send a force here, and a force there, and a force all about the country, to prevent murders, robberies, and larcenies which, it was said, were threatened by the Mormons. No such forces were sent, nor were any such offences committed at that time, except the stealing of some provisions, and there was never the least proof that this was done by a Mormon.\" On the morning to which he refers, the report was brought to him with the usual alarming accompani ments of fears being expressed of frightful carnage, and the like. Hastily dressing, he assured the crowd collected outside of the house in which he had lodged that they need have no uneasiness respecting the mat ter, for he was very sure he could settle the difficulty peaceably. The Mormon prophet knew him well,"], [228, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 174 and would trust him. What he purposed doing was to demand the surrender of Joseph Smith and others. He wished them to promise him that they would lend their assistance to protect the prisoners from violence, which they agreed to do. After his arrival at Carthage the governor sent two men to Nauvoo as a committee to wait on Joseph Smith, informing him of his arrival, with a request that Smith would inform him in relation to the diffi culties that then existed in the county. Dr J. M. Bernhisel and Elder John Taylor were appointed as a committee by Smith, and furnished with affidavits and documents iu relation both to the proceedings of the Mormons and those of the mob; in addition to the general history of the transaction they took with them a duplicate of those documents which had previously been forwarded by Bishop Hunter, Elder James, and others. This committee waited on the governor, who expressed an opinion that Joseph Smith and all par ties concerned in passing or executing the city law in relation to the press had better come to Carthage; however repugnant it might be to their feelings, he thought it would have a tendency to allay public ex citement, aud prove to the people what they professed, that they wished to be governed by law. The next day the constable and a force of ten men were de spatched to Nauvoo to make the arrests. The accused were told that if they surrendered they would be pro tected; otherwise the whole force of the state would be called out, if necessary, to take them. Upon the arrival of the constable and his posse, the mayor and the members of the city council declared that they were willing to surrender. Eight o'clock was the hour appointed, but the accused failed to make their appearance; whereupon the constable returned, and reported that they had fled. The governor was of opin ion that the constable's action was part of a plot to get the troops into Nauvoo and exterminate the Mor mons. He called a council of officers and proposed to"], [229, "TREASON OR NO TREASON. 175 march on the town with the small force under his command, but was dissuaded. He hesitated to make a further call on the militia, as the harvest was nigh and the men were needed to gather it. Meanwhile, ascer taining that the Mormons had three pieces of cannon and two hundred and fifty stand of arms belonging to the state, the possession of which gave offence to the gentiles, he demanded a surrender of the state arms, again promising protection. On the 24th of June29 Joseph and Hyrum Smith, the members of the council, and all others demanded, proceeded to Carthage, gave themselves up, and were charged with riot. All entered into recognizances before the justice of the peace to appear for trial, and were released from custody. Joseph and Hyrum, however, were rearrested, and, says Ford, were charged with overt treason, having ordered out the legion to resist the posse comitatus, though, as he states, the degree of their crime would depend on circum stances. The governor's views on this matter are worthy of note. \"The overt act of treason charged against them,\" he remarks, \"consisted in the alleged levying of war against the state by declaring martial law in Nauvoo, and in ordering out the legion to resist the posse comitatus. Their actual guiltiness of the charge would depend upon circumstances. If their opponents had been seeking to put the law in force in good faith, and nothing more, then an array of a military force in open resistance to the posse comitatus and the militia of the state most probably would have amounted to treason. But if those opponents merely intended to use the process of the law, the militia of the state, and the posse comitatus as cat's paws to compass the possession of their persons for the purpose of murdering them afterward, as the \" Report, ut supra, 10-11. In Times and Seasons, v. 560, it is stated that ' on Monday, June 24th, after Ford had sent word that eighteen persons demanded on a warrant, among whom were Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith, should be protected by the militia of the state, they in company with ten or twelve others start for Carthage. '"], [230, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 176 sequel demonstrated the fact to be, it might well be doubted whether they were guilty of treason.\" With the Nauvoo Legion at their back, the two brothers voluntarily placed themselves in the power of the governor who, demanding and accepting, their surrender, though doubting their guilt, nevertheless declared that they were not his prisoners, but the pris oners of the constable and jailer. Leaving two com panies to guard the jail, he disbanded the main body of his troops, and proceeding to Nauvoo, addressed the people, beseeching them to abide by the law. \"They claimed,\" he says, \"to be a law-abiding people; and insisted that as they looked to the law alone for their protection, so were they careful themselves to observe its provisions. Upon the conclusion of my address, I proposed to take a vote on the question, whether they would strictly observe the laws, even in opposition to their prophet and leaders. The vote was unanimous in favor of this proposition.\" The governor then set forth for Carthage, and such in substance is his report when viewed in the most favorable light.30 It is related that as Joseph set forth to deliver himself up to the authorities he exclaimed: \"I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offence toward God and toward all men. I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me, He was murdered in cold blood.\"31 Nevertheless, for a moment he hesitated. Should he offer himself a willing sacrifice, or should he endeavor to escape out of their hands? Thus meditating, he crossed the river thinking 30 Message, ut supra. The above appear to be the facts of the case, so far as they can be sifted from a lengthy report, which consists mainly of apology or explanation of what the governor did or left undone. 31 Smith's Doc. and Cov., app. 335. The same morning he read in the fifth chapter of Ether, 'And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the gentiles grace, that they might have charity. And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me, If they have not charity it mattereth not unto you, thou hast been faithful; wherefore thy garments are clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my father.'"], [231, "AT CARTHAGE. 177 to depart. On reaching the opposite bank he turned and gazed upon the beautiful city, the holy city, his own hallowed creation, the city of Joseph, with its shining temple, its busy hum of industry, and its thousand happy homes. And they were his people who were there, his very own, given to him of God ; and he loved them! Were he to leave them now, to abandon them in this time of danger, they would be indeed as sheep without a shepherd, stricken, and scattered, and robbed, and butchered by the destroyer. No, he could not do it. Better die than to abandon them thus I So he recrossed the river, saying to his brother Hyrum, \"Come, let us go together, and let God determine what we shall do or suffer.\" Bidding their families and friends adieu, the two brothers set out for Carthage. Their hearts were very heavy. There was dire evil abroad; the air was oppressive, and the sun shot forth malignant rays. Once more they returned to their people; once more they embraced their wives and kissed their children, as if they knew, alas! that they should never see them again. The party reached Carthage about midnight, and on the following day the troops were formed in line, and Joseph and Hyrum passed up and down in company with the governor, who showed them every respect\u2014 either as guests or victims \u2014 introducing them as military officers under the title of general. Pres ent were the Carthage Greys, who showed signs of mutiny, hooting at and insulting the prisoners \u2014 for such in fact they were, being committed to jail the same afternoon until discharged by due course of law. A few hours later Joseph asked to see the governor, and next morning Ford went to the prison. \"All this is illegal,\" said the former. \"It is a purely civil matter, not a question to be settled by force of arms.\" \" I know it,\" said the governor, \"but it is better so; I did not call out this force, but found it assembled; I pledge you my honor, however, and the faith and honor of Hist. Utah. 19"], [232, "178 THE STORY OF MORMONISM. the state, that no harm shall come to you while un dergoing this imprisonment.\" The governor took his departure on the morning of the 27th of June. Scarcely was he well out of the way when measures were taken for the consummation of a most damning deed. The prison was guarded by eight men detailed from the Carthage Greys, their company being in camp on the public square a quarter of a mile dis tant, while another company under Williams, also the sworn enemies of the Mormons, was encamped eight miles away, there awaiting the development of events. It was a little after five o'clock in the evening. Jo seph and Hyrum Smith were confined in an upper room. With the prisoners were John Taylor and Wil lard Richards, other friends having withdrawn a few moments before. \u25a0 At this juncture a band of a hun dred and fifty armed men with painted faces appeared before the jail, and presently surrounded it. The guard shouted vociferously and fired their guns over the heads of the assailants, who paid not the slightest attention to them.32 I give what followed from Burtons City of the Saints, being the statement of President John Taylor, who was present and wounded on the occasion. \"I was sitting at one of the front windows of the jail, when I saw a number of men, with painted faces, coming around the corner of the jail, and aiming toward the stairs. The other brethren had seen the same, for, as I went to the door, I found Brother Hyrum Smith and Dr Richards already leaning against it. They both pressed against the door with their shoulders to prevent its being opened, as the lock and latch were comparatively useless. While in this position, the mob, who had come up stairs, and tried to open the door, probably thought it was 82 Littlefield says the Carthage Greys were marched in a body, ' within about eight rods of the jail, where they halted, in plain view of the whole transac tion, until the deed was executed.' Narrative, 9."], [233, "DEATH OF HYRUM. 179 locked, and fired a ball through the keyhole; at this Dr Richards and Brother Hyrum leaped back from the door, with their faces toward it; almost instantly another ball passed through the panel of the door, and struck Brother Hyrum on the left side of the nose, entering his face and head. At the same instant, another ball from the outside entered his back, passing through his body and striking his watch. The ball came from the back, through the jail window, opposite the door, and must, from its range, have been fired from the Carthage Greys, who were placed there ostensibly for our protection, as the balls from the fire-arms, shot close by the jail, would have entered the ceiling, we being in the second story, and there never was a time after that when Hyrum could have received the latter wound. Immediately, when the balls struck him, he fell flat on his back, crying as he fell, 'I am a dead man!' He never moved after ward. \" I shall never forget the deep feeling of sympathy and regard manifested in the countenance of Brother Joseph as he drew nigh to Hyrum, and, leaning over him, exclaimed, 'Oh! my poor, dear brother Hyrum!' He, however, instantly arose, and with a firm, quick step, and a determined expression of countenance, ap proached the door, and pulling the six-shooter left by Brother Wheelock from his pocket, opened the door slightly, and snapped the pistol six successive times; only three of the barrels, however, were discharged. I afterward understood that two or three were wounded by these discharges, two of whom, I am in formed, died.83 I had in my hands a 'arge, strong hickory stick, brought there by Brother Markham, and left by him, which I had seized as soon as I saw the mob approach; and while Brother Joseph was firing the pistol, I stood close behind him. As soon **'He wounded three of them, two mortally, one of whom, as he rushed down out of the door, was asked if he was badly hurt. He replied, \"Yes; my arm is shot all to pieces by old Joe; but I don't care, I've got re venge; I shot Hyrum 1\" ' Id., 11."], [234, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 180 as he had discharged it he stepped back, and I im mediately took his place next to the door, while he occupied the one I had done while he was shooting. Brother Richards, at this time, had a knotty walking stick in his hands belonging to me, and stood next to Brother Joseph, a little farther from the door, in an oblique direction, apparently to avoid the rake of the fire from the door. The firing of Brother Joseph made our assailants pause for a moment; very soon after, however, they pushed the door some distance open, and protruded and discharged their guns into the room, when I parried them off with my stick, giving another direction to the balls. \"It certainly was a terrible scene: streams of fire as thick as my arm passed by me as these men fired, and, unarmed as we were, it looked like certain death. I remember feeling as though my time had come, but I do not know when, in any critical position, I was more calm, unruffled, energetic, and acted with more promptness and decision. It certainly was far from pleasant to be so near the muzzles of those fire-arms as they belched forth their liquid flames and deadly balls. While I was engaged in parrying the guns, Brother Joseph said, 'That's right, Brother Taylor, parry them off as well as you can.' These were the last words I ever heard him speak on earth. \"Every moment the crowd at the door became more dense, as they were unquestionably pressed on by those in the rear ascending the stairs, until the whole entrance at the door was literally crowded with muskets and rifles, which, with the swearing, shout ing, and demoniacal expressions of those outside the door and on the stairs, and the firing of the guns. mingled with their horrid oaths and execrations, made it look like pandemonium let loose, and was, indeed, a fit representation of the horrid deed in which they were engaged. \"After parrying the guns for some time, which now -rotruded thicker and farther into the room, and"], [235, "TAYLOR BADLY WOUNDED. 181 seeing no hope of escape or protection there, as we were now unarmed, it occurred to me that we might have some friends outside, and that there might be some chance to escape in that direction, but here there seemed to be none. As I expected them every moment to rush into the room \u2014 nothing but extreme cowardice having thus far kept them out \u2014 as the tumult and pressure increased, without any other hope, I made a spring for the window which was right in front of the jail door, where the mob was standing, and also exposed to the fire of the Carthage Greys, who were stationed some ten or twelve rods off. The weather was hot, we had our coats off, and the window was raised to admit air. As I reached the window, and was on the point of leaping out, I was struck by a ball from the door about midway of my thigh, which struck the bone and flattened out almost to the size of a quarter of a dollar, and then passed on through the fleshy part to within about half an inch of the outside. I think some prominent nerve must have been severed or injured, for, as soon as the ball struck me, I fell like a bird when shot, or an ox when struck by a butcher, and lost entirely and instantaneously all power of action or locomotion. I fell upon the window-sill, and cried out, 'I am shot!' Not possessing any power to move, I felt myself fall- ing outside of the window, but immediately I fell inside, from some, at that time, unknown cause. When I struck the floor my animation seemed re- stored, as I have seen it sometimes in squirrels and birds after being shot. As soon as I felt the power of motion I crawled under the bed, which was in a corner of the room, not far from the window where I received my wound. While on my way and under the bed I was wounded in three other places; one ball entered a little below the left knee, and never was extracted; another entered the forepart of my left arm, a little above the wrist, and passing down by the joint, lodged in the fleshy part of my hand, about"], [236, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 182 midway, a little above the upper joint of my little finger; another struck me on the fleshy part of my left hip, and tore away the flesh as large as my hand, dashing the mangled fragments of flesh and blood against the wall. \"It would seem that immediately after my attempt to leap out of the window, Joseph also did the same thing, of which circumstance I have no knowledge only from information. The first thing that I noticed was a cry that he had leaped out of the window. A cessation of firing followed, the mob rushed down stairs, and Dr. Richards went to the window. Im mediately afterward I saw the doctor going toward the jail door, and as there was an iron door at the head of the stairs adjoining our door which led into the cells for criminals, it struck me that the doctor was going in there, and I said to him, 'Stop, doctor, and take me along.' He proceeded to the door and opened it, and then returned and dragged me along to a small cell prepared for criminals. \"Brother Richards was very much troubled, and exclaimed, 'Oh! Brother Taylor, is it possible that they have killed both Brothers Hyrum and Joseph? it cannot surely be, and yet I saw them shoot them;' and, elevating his hands two or three times, he ex claimed, 'Oh Lord, my God, spare thy servants!' He then said, 'Brother Taylor, this is a terrible event;' and he dragged me farther into the cell, saying, 'I am sorry I can not do better for you;' and, taking an old filthy mattress, he covered me with it, and said, 'That may hide you, and you may yet live to tell the tale, but I expect they will kill me in a few moments.' While lying in this position I suffered the most excruciating pain. Soon afterward Dr. Richards came to me, informed me that the mob had precipitately fled, and at the same time confirmed my worst fears that Joseph was assuredly dead.\" It ap pears that Joseph, thus murderously beset and in dire extremity, rushed to the window and threw himself"], [237, "DEATH OF JOSEPH. 183 out, receiving in the act several shots, and with the cry, \"0 Lord, my God!\" fell dead to the ground.34 The fiends were not yet satiated; but setting up the Useless body of the slain prophet against the well curb, riddled it with bullets.35 Where now is the God of Joseph and of Hyrum, that he should permit this most iniquitous butchery? Where are Moroni and Ether and Christ? What mean these latter-day manifestations, their truth and efficacy, if the great high priest and patriarch of the new dispensation can thus be cruelly cut off by wicked men? Practical piety is the doctrine! Prayer \"Joseph dropped his pistol, and sprang into the window; but just as he was preparing to descend, he saw such an array of bayonets below, that he caught by the window casing, where he hung by his hands and feet, with his head to the north, feet to the south, and his body swinging downward. He hung in toif position three or four minutes, during which time he exclaimed two or tlw. 'O Lord, my God !' and fell to the ground. While ho was hanging in that situation, Col. Williams halloed, 'Shoot him! God damn him ! shoot the damned rascal 1 ' However, none fired at him. He seemed to fall easy. He struck partly on his right shoulder and back, his neck and head reaching the ground a little before his feet. He rolled instantly on his face. From this position he was taken by a young man who sprung to him from the other side of the fence, who held a pewter fife in his hand, was barefooted and bareheaded, having on no coat, with his pants rolled above his knees, and shirt-sleeves above his elbows. He set President Smith against the south side of the well-curb that was situated a few feet from the jail. While doing this the savage muttered aloud, ' This is old Jo ; I know him. I know yon, old Jo. Damn you ; you are the man that had my daddy shot' \u2014 intimating that he was a son of Boggs, and that it was the Missourians who were doing this murder.

It was foreordained that Joseph and Hyrum should die for the people; and the more of murder and extermination on the part of their enemies, the more praying and believing on the part of saints, and the more praise and exultation in the heavenly inheritance. The further the credulity of a credulous people is taxed the stronger will be their faith. Many of the saints believed in Joseph; with their whole mind and soul they worshipped him. He was to them as God; he was their deity present upon earth, their savior from evil, and their guide to heaven. What ever he did, that to his people was right; he could do no wrong, no more than king or pope, no more than Christ or Mahomet. Accordingly they obeyed him without question; and it was this belief and obedience that caused the gentiles to fear and hate. There are still open in the world easier fields than this for new religions, which might recommend themselves as a career to young men laboring under a fancied in exorable necessity. Whatever else may be said of Joseph Smith, it must be admitted that he was a remarkable man. His course in life was by no means along a flowery path; his death was like that which too often comes to the founder of a religion. What a commentary on the human mind and the human heart, the deeds of those who live for the love of God and man, who die for the love of God and man, who severally and col lectively profess the highest holiness, the highest charity, justice, and humanity, higher far than any held by other sect or nation, now or since the world began \u2014 how lovely to behold, to write and meditate upon their disputings and disruptions, their cruelties and injustice, their persecutions for opinion's sake, their ravenous hate and bloody butcheries!"], [239, "RELIGION AS A VOCATION. 185 The founder of Mormonism displayed a singular genius for the work he gave himself to do. He made thousands believe in him and in his doctrines, howsoever good or evil his life, howsoever true or false his teachings. The less that can be proved the more may be asserted. Any one possessing the proper abilities may found a religion and make pros elytes. His success will depend not on the truth or falsity of his statements, nor on their gross absurdity or philosophic refinement, but on the power and skill with which his propositions are promulgated. If he has not the natural and inherited genius for this work, though his be otherwise the greatest mind that ever existed, he is sure to fail. If he has the mental and physical adaptation for the work, he will succeed, whatever may be his abilities in other directions. There was more in this instance than any consid eration short of careful study makes appear: things spiritual and things temporal; the outside world and the inside workings. The prophet's days were full of trouble. His people were often petulant, his elders quarrelsome, his most able followers cautious and captious. While the world scoffed and the neighbors used violence, his high priests were continually ask ing him for prophecies, and if they were not fulfilled at once and to the letter, they stood ready to apostatize. Many did apostatize ; many behaved disgracefully, and brought reproach and enmity upon the cause. More over, Joseph was constantly in fear for his life, and though by no means desirous of death, in moments of excitement he often faced danger with apparent indifference as to the results. But without occupy ing further space with my own remarks, I will give the views of others, who loved or hated him and knew him personally and well. Of his physique and character, Parley P. Pratt re marks: \"President Joseph Smith was in person tall and well built, strong and active ; of a light complex ion, light hair, blue eyes, very little beard, and of an"], [240, "186 THE STORY OF MORMONISM. expression peculiar to himself, on which the eye natu rally rested with interest, and was never weary of be holding. His countenance was ever mild, affable, and beaming with intelligence and benevolence, min gled with a look of interest and an unconscious smile of cheerfulness, and entirely free from all restraint, or affectation of gravity; and there was something con nected with the serene and steady, penetrating glance of his eye, as if he would penetrate the deepest abyss of the human heart, gaze into eternity, penetrate the heavens, and comprehend all worlds. He possessed a noble boldness and independence of character; his manner was easy and familiar, his rebuke terrible as the lion, his benevolence unbounded as the ocean, his intelligence universal, and his language abounding in original eloquence peculiar to himself.\" And thus a female convert who arrived at Nauvoo a year or two before the prophet's death: \"The first time I ever saw Joseph Smith I recognized him from a vision that once appeared to me in a dream. His coun tenance was like that of an angel, and such as I had never beheld before. He was then thirty-seven years of age, of ordinary appearance in dress and manner, but with a child-like innocence of expression. His hair was of a light brown, his eyes blue, and his complex ion light. His natural demeanor was quiet; his char acter and disposition were formed by his life-work; he was kind and considerate, taking a personal interest in all his people, and considering every one his equal.\"36 On the other hand, the author of Mormonism Un veiled says: \"The extreme ignorance and apparent stupidity of this modern prophet were by his early followers looked upon as his greatest merit, and as furnishing the most incontestable proof of his divine mission . . . His followers have told us that he could not at the time he was chosen of the Lord even write his own name. But it is obvious that all these defi- *\" Another account says that at 36 he weighed 212 lbs, stood 6 feet in hii pumps, was robust, corpulent, and jovial, but when roused to anger his ez pression was very severe."], [241, "CHARACTERISTICS OF JOSEPH. 187 ciencies are fully supplied by a natural genius, strong inventive powers of mind, a deep study, and an unusu ally correct estimate of the human passions and feel ings. In short, he is now endowed with all the re quisite traits of character to pursue most successfully the humbug which he has introduced. His address is easy, rather fascinating and winning, of a mild and sober deportment when not irritated. But he fre quently becomes boisterous by the impertinence or curiosity of the skeptical, and assumes the bravado, instead of adhering to the meekness which he pro fesses. His followers, of course, can discover in his very countenance all the certain indications of a di vine mission.\" One more quotation will serve to show the impres sion that Joseph Smith's doctrines and discourse made not only on his own followers but on the gentiles, and even on gentile divines. In 1843 a methodist minis ter, named Prior, visited Nauvoo and was present during a sermon preached by the prophet in the tem ple. \"I took my seat,\" he remarks, \"in a conspicu ous place in the congregation, who were waiting in breathless silence for his appearance. While he tar ried, I had plenty of time to revolve in my mind the character and common report of that truly singular personage. I fancied that I should behold a counte nance sad and sorrowful, yet containing the fiery marks of rage and exasperation. I supposed that I should be enabled to discover in him some of those thought ful and reserved features, those mystic and sarcastic glances, which I had fancied the ancient sages to pos sess. I expected to see that fearful faltering look of conscious shame which from what I had heard of him he might be expected to evince. He appeared at last; but how was I disappointed when, instead of the head and horns of the beast and false prophet, I beheld only the appearance of a common man, of tolerably large proportions. \"I was sadly disappointed, and thought that, al-"], [242, "188 THE STORY OF MORMONISM. though his appearance could not be wrested to indi cate anything against him, yet he would manifest all I had heard of him when he began to preach. I sat uneasily and watched him closely. He commenced preaching, not from the book of Mormon, however, but from the bible; the first chapter of the first of Peter was his text. He commenced calmly, and con tinued dispassionately to pursue his subject, while I sat in breathless silence, waiting to hear that foul aspersion of the other sects, that diabolical disposi tion of revenge, and to hear that rancorous denuncia tion of every individual but a Mormon. I waited in vain; I listened with surprise; I sat uneasy in my seat, and could hardly persuade myself but that he had been apprised of my presence, and so ordered his discourse on my account, that I might not be able to find fault with it; for instead of a umbled jargon of half-connected sentences, and a \\ lley of imprecations, and diabolical and malignant denuncia tions heaped upon the heads of all who differed from him, and the dreadful twisting and wresting of the scriptures to suit his own peculiar views, and attempt to weave a web of dark and mystic sophistry around the gospel truths, which I had anticipated, he glided along through a very interesting and elaborate dis course, with all the care and happy facility of one who was well aware of his important station and his duty to God and man.\"37 No event, probably, that had occurred thus far in the history of the saints gave to the cause of Mor monism so much of stability as the assassination of Jo seph Smith. Not all the militia mobs in Illinois, in Missouri, or in the United States could destroy this cause, any more than could the roundheads in the \" Mackay's The Mormons, 131-3. Of course views as to Joseph Smith's character are expressed in nearly all the works published on Mormonism.

The deed but reacted on those who committed it. When two miles on his way from Nauvoo, the gov ernor was met by messengers who informed him of the assassination, and, as he relates, he was \" struck with a kind of dumbness.\" At daybreak the next morning all the bells in Carthage were ringing. It was noised abroad throughout Hancock county, he says, that the Mormons had attempted the rescue of Joseph and Hy rum ; that they had been killed in order to prevent their escape, and that the governor was closely besieged at Nauvoo by the Nauvoo Legion, and could hold out only for two days. Ford was convinced that \" those whoever they were who assassinated the Smiths meditated in turn his assassination by the Mormons,\" thinking that they would thus rid themselves of the Smiths and the governor, and that the result would be the expulsion of the saints, for Ford had shown a determination to defend Nauvoo, so far as lay in his power, from the threatened violence. Arriving at Carthage at ten o'clock at night, he found the citi zens in flight with their families and effects, one of his companies broken up, and the Carthage Greys also disbanding, the citizens that remained being in instant fear of attack. At length he met with John Taylor and Willard Richards, who, notwithstanding the ill usage they had received, came to the relief of the panic-stricken magistrate, and addressed a letter to their brethren at Nauvoo, exhorting them to preserve the peace, the latter stating that he had pledged his word that no violence would be used. The letter of Richards and Taylor, signed also by Samuel H. Smith, a brother of the deceased, who a few weeks afterward died, as the Mormons relate, of a broken heart, prevented a threatened uprising of the saints.83 On the 29th of June, the day after the news was received, the legion was called out, the letter read, \"To the letter was appended a postscript from the governor, bidding the Mormons defend themselves until protection could be furnished, and one from"], [244, "THE STORY OF MORMONISM. 190 and the fury of the citizens allayed by addresses from Judge Phelps, Colonel Buckmaster, the governor's aid, and others. In the afternoon the bodies of Joseph and Hyrum arrived in wagons guarded by three men. They were met by the city council, the prophet's staff, the officers of the legion, and a vast procession of citizens, crying out \"amid the most solemn lamentations and wailings that ever ascended into the ears of the Lord of hosts to be avenged of their enemies.\" Arriving at the Nauvoo House, the assemblage, numbering ten thousand persons, was again addressed, and \" with one united voice resolved to trust to the law for a remedy of such a high-handed assassination, and when that failed, to call upon God to avenge them of their wrongs. Oh! widows and orphans ! Oh Americans ! weep, for the glory of free dom has departed I\" Meanwhile the governor, fearing that the Mormons would rise in a body to execute vengeance, issued an address to the people of Illinois, in which he attempted to explain his conduct,39 and again called out the militia. Two officers were despatched to Nauvoo, with orders to ascertain the disposition of the citizens, and to proceed thence to Warsaw, where were the headquarters of the anti-Mormon militia, and forbid violent measures in the name of the state. On arriv- ing at the former place they laid their instructions before the members of the municipality. A meeting of the council was summoned, and it was resolved that the saints rigidly sustain the laws and the governor, so long as they are themselves sustained in their constitutional rights; that they discountenance ven geance on the assassins of Joseph and Hyrum Smith; that instead of an appeal to arms, they appeal to the majesty of the law, and, should the law fail, they General Deming, telling them to remain quiet, that the assassination would be condemned by three fourths of the people of Illinois, but that they were in danger of attack from Missouri, and 'prudence might obviate material destruction.'

A meeting of citizens was then held in the public square; the people were addressed, the resolutions read, and all responded with a hearty amen. The two officers then returned to Carthage and reported to the governor, who was so greatly pleased with the forbearance of the saints that he officially declared them \"human beings and citizens of the state.\" He caused writs to be issued for the arrest of three of the murderers \u2014 after they had taken refuge in Missouri.40 The assassins escaped punishment, however; and now that order was restored, the chief magistrate disbanded the militia, after what he termed \"a campaign of about thirteen days.\" On the afternoon of July 1st a letter was addressed by Richards, Taylor, and Phelps to the citizens of Nau voo, and a fortnight later, an epistle signed by the same persons and also by Parley P. Pratt was despatched to all the saints throughout the world. \"Be peace able, quiet citizens, doing the works of righteousness; and as soon as the twelve and other authorities can assemble, or a majority of them, the onward course to the great gathering of Israel, and the final con summation of the dispensation of the fulness of times, will be pointed out, so that the murder of Abel, the assassination of hundreds, the righteous blood of all the holy prophets, from Abel to Joseph, sprinkled with the best blood of the son of God, as the crim son sign of remission, only carries conviction to the business and bosoms of all flesh, that the cause is just and will continue; and blessed are they that hold out faithful to the end, while apostates, consenting to the shedding of innocent blood, have no forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come. . .Let no vain 40 In Message to III.

Some were already making preparations to return to the gentiles; some feared that their organization as a sect would soon come to an end. To reassure them, one more address was issued on August 15th, in the name of the twelve apostles,42 and signed by Brigham Young, the presi dent of the apostles. The saints were told that though they were now without a prophet present in the flesh, the twelve would administer and regulate the affairs of the church ; and that even if they should be taken away, there were still others who would insure the triumph of their cause throughout the world. In 1830, as will be remembered, the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized in a chamber by a few humble men; in 1844 the prophet's followers mustered scores of thousands. Speedy dis solution was now predicted by some, while others argued that as all his faults would lie buried in the tomb, while on his virtues martyrdom would shed its lustre, the progress of the sect would be yet more remarkable. The latter prediction was verified, and after the Mormons had suffered another period of per secution, Joseph Smith the martyr became a greater power in the land than Joseph Smith the prophet. 0 The full text of both letters is given in Times and Seasons, v. 568, 586 7; Mackay's The Mormons, 180-2; Smucker's Hist.

Upon the death of Joseph Smith, one of the ques tions claiming immediate attention was, Who shall be his successor? It was the first time the question had arisen in a manner to demand immediate solution, and the matter of succession was not so well deter mined then as now, it being at present well established that upon the death of the president of the church the apostle eldest in ordination and service takes his place. Personal qualifications would have much to do with it; rules could be established later. The first consid eration now was to keep the church from falling in pieces. None realized the situation better than Brig ham Young, who soon made up his mind that he him self was the man for the emergency. Then to make it appear plain to the brethren that God would have him take Joseph's place, his mind thus works: \"The first thing that I thought of,\" he says, \"was whether Joseph had taken the keys of the kingdom with him Hist.

Bring ing my hand down on my knee, I said, 'The keys of .the kingdom are right here with the church.'\" But who held the keys of the kingdom ? This was the all absorbing question that was being discussed at Nauvoo when Brigham and the other members of the quorum arrived at that city on the 6th of August, 1844. Brigham Young was born at Whitingham, Wind ham county, Vermont, on the 1st of June, 1801. His father, John, a Massachusetts farmer, served as a pri vate soldier in the revolutionary war, and his grand father as surgeon in the French and Indian war.1 In 1804 his family, which included nine children,2 of whom he was then the youngest, removed to Sherburn, Chenango county, New York, where for a time hard ship and poverty were their lot. Concerning Brig ham's youth there is little worthy of record. Lack of means compelled him, almost without education, to earn his own livelihood, as did his brothers, finding employment as best the)- could. Thus, at the age of twenty-three, when he married he had learned how to work as farmer, carpenter, joiner, painter, and glazier, in the last of which occupations he was an ex: pert craftsman. In 1829 he removed to Mendon, Monroe county, where his father then resided; and here, for the first time, he saw the book of Mormon at the house of his brother Phineas, who had been a pastor in the re formed methodist church, but was now a convert to Mormonism.3 1 Waite's The Mormon Prophet and his Harem. Linforth, Route from Liverpool, 1 12, note, states that his grandfather was an officer in the revolu tionary war; this is not confirmed by Mrs Waite, who quotes from Brigham's autobiography.

Smith, brother of the prophet; on the 14th of April, 1832, he was bap tized, and on the same night ordained an elder, his father5 and all his brothers afterward becoming pros elytes. During the same month he set forth to meet the prophet at Kirtland, where he found him and several of his brethren chopping wood. \" Here,\" says Brigham, \"my joy was full at the privilege of shak ing the hand of the prophet of God . . . He was happy to see us and bid us welcome. In the evening a few of the brethren came in, and we conversed together upon the things of the kingdom. He called upon me to pray. In my prayer I spoke in tongues. As soon as we rose from our knees, the brethren flocked around him, and asked his opinion. . .He told them it was the pure Adamic language;. . .it is of God, and the time will come when Brother Brigham Young will preside over this church.\" In 1835 he was chosen, as will be remembered, one of the quorum of the twelve, and the following spring set forth on a mis sionary tour to the eastern states. Returning early in the winter, he saved the life of the prophet, and otherwise rendered good service during the great apostasy of 1836, when the church passed through its darkest hour.6 Brigham was ever a devoted follower of the prophet, and at the risk of his own life, shielded him against the persecutions of apostates. At the close of 1837 he was driven by their machinations from Kirtland,7 church, Phineas had wrought a miracle, 'whereby a young girl on the point of death had been restored to life.'

In a speech delivered after he became president, Brigham says: 'Ascertaining that a plot was laid to waylay Joseph for the purpose of taking his life, on his return from Monroe, Michi gan, to Kirtland, I procured a horse and buggy, and took brother William Smith along to meet Joseph, whom we met returning in the stage-coach.

Thence, in company with the former, he went to Mis souri, arriving at Far West a short time before the massacre at Haun's Mill. Once more Brigham was compelled to flee for his life, and now betook himself to Quincy, where he raised means to aid the destitute brethren in leaving Missouri,8 and directed the first settlement of the saints in Illinois, the prophet Joseph, Parley P. Pratt, and others being then in prison. By revelation of July 8, 1838,9 it was ordered that eleven of the quorum should \" depart to go over the great waters, and there promulgate my gospel, the fulness thereof, and bear record of my name. Let them take leave of my saints in the city Far West, on the 26th day of April next; on the building spot of my house, saith the Lord.\" As the twelve had been ban ished from Missouri and could not return with safety, many of the church dignitaries urged that the latter part of this revelation should not be fulfilled. \"But,\" says Brigham, \" I felt differently, and so did those of the quorum who were with me.\" The affairs of the church were now in the hands of the twelve, and their president was not the man to shrink from danger. \" The Lord had spoken, and it was their duty to obey.\" The quorum started forth, and reaching Far West toward the end of April, hid themselves in a grove.

Marsh, in 1839, the office of president of the twelve devolved by right on Brigham by reason of his seniority of membership. On the 14th of April, 1840, he was publicly accepted by the council as their head, and at the reorganization of the church councils at Nauvoo he was appointed by revelation on the 19th of Janu ary, 1843, president of the twelve travelling council. After the founding of Nauvoo, the president, to gether with three others of the quorum,11 sailed for Liverpool, where they arrived on the 6th of April, 1840, the tenth anniversary of the organization of the church. Here lie was engaged for about a year in missionary work, of which more hereafter. Taking ship for New York on the 20th of April, 1841, he reached Nauvoo on the 1st of July, and was warmly welcomed by the prophet, who a few days afterward13 received the following revelation: \"Dear and well beloved brother Brigham Young, verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Brigham, it is no more required at your hand to leave your family as in times past, for your offering is acceptable to me; I have seen your labor and toil in journeyings for my name.

When Governor Ford and bis militia were prepar ing to march on Nauvoo for the purpose of forestall ing civil war, the only course open to the prophet and his followers was a removal from Illinois. In 1842 an expedition had been planned to explore the coun try toward or beyond the Rocky Mountains; but when Joseph Smith put himself forward as a candi date for the presidency of the United States, all other matters were for the time forgotten. Brigham claimed that had he been present the assassination would never have occurred; he would not have per mitted the prophet's departure for Carthage: rather would he have sent him to the mountains under a guard of elders. But Brigham had no reason to complain of the dispensation of providence which was now to bring his clear, strong j udgment and resolute will to the front. Prominent among the aspirants for the presidency of the church was Sidney Rigdon, one of the first and ablest to espouse the cause, and not altogether without grounds for his pretensions. He had performed much labor, had encountered many trials, and had received scanty honors, being at present nothing more than preacher, and professor of history, belles-lettres, and oratory.

But Sidney would not humble himself. Soon after Joseph's death, at which he was not present, he had a revela tion of his own, bidding him conduct the saints to Pittsburgh.14 Visiting that city, he found the time not yet ripe for this measure; and meanwhile return ing to Nauvoo, the 3d of August, he offered himself on the following day as a candidate for the presidency, aided by Elder Marks. Sidney now put forth all his strength to gain influ ence and secure retainers. He must have Joseph's mantle; he must have the succession, or henceforth he would be nothing. It was a momentous question, not to be disposed of in a day. To substantiate his claim, Sidney could now have visions with the best of them ; on various occasions he told how the Lord had through him counselled the people to appoint him as their guar dian. He requested that a meeting should be held on the following sabbath, the 8th of August, for the further consideration of the matter. But prior to this meeting Parley Pratt and two others of the twelve bade the candidate go with them to the house of John Taylor, who yet lay prostrate with his wounds. Tay lor expostulated with him, but to no purpose. Sidney continued to press his claims, even assuming the sacred office, prophesying and ordaining. On the sabbath named, according to appointment, Sidney and his sup porters met in the grove near the temple; but were confronted by the apostles, with Brigham at their head.

After singing and prayer, through the vast assemblage was heard a voice, strikingly clear, distinct, and penetrating.15 It was the voice of Brigham, who said: \"Attention, all! For the first time in my life I am called to act as chief of the twelve; for the first time in your lives you are called to walk by faith, your prophet being no longer present in the flesh. I desire that every one present shall exercise the fullest liberty.

Elder Philips then motioned that all \"who have voted for Sidney Rigdon be suspended until they can have a trial before the high council.\"18 The truth is, Sidney was no match for Brigham. It was a battle of the lion and the lamb; only Brig- 15 'He [Brigham] said, as he stood on the stand, he would rather sit in sack cloth and ashes for a month than appear before the people, but he pitied their loneliness, and was constrained to step forward, and we knew he was, because he had the voice and manner of Joseph, as hundreds can testify.

Something more than oratory was nec essary to win in this instance; and of that something, with great joy in his heart, Brigham found himself in possession. It was the combination of qualities which we find present primarily in all great men, in all leaders of men \u2014 intellectual force, mental superiority, united with personal magnetism, and physique enough to give weight to will and opinion; for Brigham Young was assuredly a great man, if by greatness we mean one who is superior to others in strength and skill, moral, intellectual, or physical. The secret of this man's power \u2014 a power that within a few years made itself felt throughout the world \u2014 was this : he was a sincere man, or if an impostor, he was one who first imposed upon himself. He was not a hypocrite; knave, in the ordinary sense of the term, he was not; though he has been a thousand times called both. If he was a bad man, he was still a great man, and the evil that he did was done with honest purpose. He possessed great ad ministrative ability; he was far-seeing, with a keen in sight into human nature, and a thorough knowledge of the good and evil qualities of men, of their virtues and frailties.

Sidney Rigdon was a native of Saint Clair, Penn., where he was born in 1793. Until his 26th year he worked on his father's farm, but in 1819 received a license to preach, ironi the society known as the regular baptists, being appointed in 1822 to the charge of the first baptist church in Pittsburgh, where he became very popu lar.

The work of the latter was done. It was a singular work, to which he was singularly adapted; the work yet to be done is no less remarkable, and a no less remark able agent is raised up at the right moment. Mat ters assume now a more material turn, and a more material nature is required to master them \u2014 if coarser grained, more practical, rougher, more dogmatical, dealing less in revelations from heaven and more in self-protection and self-advancement here on earth, so much the better for the saints. \"Strike, but hear me!\" Joseph with Themistocles used to cry; \"I will strike, and you shall hear me,\" Brigham would say. No wonder the American Israel received Brigham as the gift of God, the Lion of the Lord,20 though the explanation of the new ruler himself would have been nearer that of the modern evolutionist, who would account for Brigham's success as the survival of the fittest. It was fortunate for the saints at this juncture that their leader should be less prophet than priest and king, less idealist than business manager, political economist, and philosopher. Brigham holds communion with spiritual powers but distantly, per haps distrustfully; at all events, he commands the spirits rather than let them command him; and the older he grows the less he has to do with them; and the less he has to do with heavenly affairs, the more his mind dwells on earthly matters. His prophecies are eminently practical; his people must have piety that will pay. And later, and all through his life, his posi tion is a strange one. If the people about Nauvoo are troublesome, God orders him west; and then he tells and afterward built up churches at Mantua and Mentor in that state. In 1 S30 he joined the Mormon church, being converted by the preaching of Par ley.

There were others in the field against him, aspirants for the late prophet's place, besides Sidney; but direct ing his efforts only against the most powerful of them, the president of the twelve summoned the quorum and the people, as we have seen, crushed Rigdon and his adherents by one of the master-strokes which he was now learning, declared the revelations of Rigdon to be of the devil, cut him off, cursed him, and was himself elected almost without a dissenting voice, giving all ostensibly the fullest liberty to act, yet permitting none of them to do so, and even causing ten to be tried for dissenting. Henceforth none dared to gainsay his authority; he became not only the leader of the Mor mons, but their dictator; holding authority for a time as president of the twelve apostles, and finally in the capacity of the first presidency, being made president of the whole church in December 1847. Brigham Young was now in his forty-third year, in the prime of a hale and vigorous manhood, with ex uberant vitality, with marvelous energy, and with un swerving faith in his cause and in himself.

In manner and address he was easy and void of affectation, deliberate in speech, con veying his original and suggestive ideas in apt though homely phrase.21 When in council he was cool and imperturbable, slow to decide, and in no haste to act; but when the time for action came he worked with an energy that was satisfied only with success. Like his predecessor, he was under all circumstances naturally a brave man, possessing great physical strength, and with nerves unshaken by much excess or sickness. That he was given to strong drink has often been asserted by his enemies, but never by his friends, and rarely by impartial observers. He was always in full possession of himself, being far too wise a man to destroy himself through any indiscre tion. He was undoubtedly the man for the occasion, however, for no other could, at this juncture, save the Mormons from dissolution as a sect and as a people. If the saints had selected as their leader a man less resolute, less confident, less devoted to his cause and to his people, a man like Sidney Rigdon, 21 Bowles, Across the Continent, 86, says that even at 64 he spoke ungram matically. This criticism is a fair commentary on the difference between a Bowles and a Brigham."], [259, "THE MORMON LEADERS COMPARED. 205 for example, Mormonism would have split into half a dozen petty factions, the strongest of which would hardly be worthy of notice. Discussing the great Mormon leaders, Hyde, who though an apostate was one of the most impartial of writers, says: \"Brigham Young is far superior to Smith in everything that constitutes a great leader. Smith was not a man of genius; his forte was tact. He only embraced opportunities that presented them selves. He used circumstances, but did not create them. The compiling genius of Mormonism was Sidney Rigdon. Smith had boisterous impetuosity, but no foresight. Polygamy was not the result of his policy, but of his passions. Sidney gave point, direc tion, and apparent consistency to the Mormon system of theology. He invented its forms and many of its arguments. He and Parley Pratt were its leading orators and polemics. Had it not been for the acces sion of these two men, Smith would have been lost, and his schemes frustrated and abandoned. That Brigham was superior not only to Smith but also to Rigdon is evident.\" Burton says: \"His manner is at once affable and impressive, simple and courteous,. . .shows no sign of dogmatism,. . .impresses a stranger with a certain sense of power; his followers are, of course, wholly fascinated by his superior strength of brain.\" Temper even and placid, manner cold, but he is neither morose nor methodistic. Often reproves in violent language ; powers of observation acute; has an excellent mem ory, and is a keen judge of character. \"If he dis likes a stranger at the first interview, he never sees him again. Of his temperance and sobriety there is but one opinion. His life is ascetic; his favorite food is baked potatoes with a little buttermilk, and his drink water.\"22 \" City of the Saints, 292-3; Mormonism, 170.

Further: though he made his people obey him, he shared their privations. Soon we shall find him rousing his followers from the lethargy of despair, when their very hearts had died within them, and when all cheeks blanched but his; speaking words of cheer to the men, and with his own sick child in his arms, sharing his scant rations with women and children who held out their hands for bread. For a brief space after the election of Brigham the saints had rest. The city of Nauvoo continued to thrive;23 a portion of the temple was finished and dedicated,24 the building of the Nauvoo house and council-house was progressing rapidly. Their buildiugs were erected with great sacrifice of time, and amidst difficulties and discouragement in consequence of poverty. Money was exceedingly scarce.25 The revelation requiring tithing, made in 1838, was first practically applied in Nauvoo; the tenth day was regularly given to work on the temple ; the penny subscriptions of the sisters are mentioned, which was a weekly contribution, and was intended for the purchase of glass and nails. Every effort was made to encourage manufacture, and to utilize their water-power.

There were frequent entertainments given in the way of dances and public dinners in the Nauvoo mansion and in the bowery six miles out of the city.27 At their confer ence in April, thousands gathered. The temple was pushed forward, as the people were counselled to re ceive their endowments there as early as possible. On the 24th of May the walls were finished, and the event was duly celebrated.28 On the 5th of October their first meeting in the temple was held.29 From mites and tithings it was estimated that a million dol lars had been raised. Brigham, Parley, and others of the quorum administered in the temples to hun dreds of people, the services often continuing all day and night.30 At the end of December one thousand of the people had received the ordinances. And all this was done midst renewed persecutions, and while the people were making preparations to evacuate the city.

The whigs and the democrats of Illinois had both sought to secure the Mormon vote, until finally they began to declare that Mormonism signified a government not in accord with that of the United States. The city charter had been repealed in January 1845, and Dan iel Spencer, who had been elected to fill the remain der of the term of the murdered mayor, was deposed, as were all the other city officers; a new charter was before the legislature, but never granted. These and like measures, followed as they were by the discharge of Joseph Smith's assassins, imparted to the gentiles renewed courage. The crimes of the whole country were laid at the door of the saints. Nauvoo was de nounced as a den of counterfeiters, cattle-thieves, and assassins,31 the leaders of the gang being men who in the name of religion outraged all sense of decency. The saints retaliated in kind ; and shortly it came about that in sections settled by Mormons gentiles feared to travel, and in sections settled by gentiles Mormons feared to travel. In view of this state of affairs, which was more like old-time feudalism than latter-day repub licanism, Governor Ford made an inspection of the city, and declared that fewer thefts were committed in Nauvoo in proportion to population than in any other town in the state. The cause of this, however, may have lain in the fact that the population of Nau voo was chiefly Mormon, and whatever might be their depredations upon the gentiles, the saints were not accustomed to steal from each other. At a place called the Morley settlement, in Han cock county, in September 1845, the people held a meeting to devise means for the prevention of thievery. Though few definite charges were advanced, there was much said derogatory to Mormon honesty. Presently the discharge of a gun was heard, once or twice, perhaps more. It was said the shots were fired 31 For specimens of the accusations brought against them, see HaU'a Mor monism Exposed, 24-34."], [263, "THE RIOT AT MORLEY. 209 by Mormons, and that they took aim at the house in which the meeting was held. Soon 'the cry went abroad that the Mormons were in arms, and there were quickly volunteers at hand to help the men of Morley. A meeting was held, and it was resolved to expel the saints. At the time appointed, armed bands appeared and burned some twenty Mormon dwellings, driving the inmates into the bushes.32 The people of Illinois were evidently now determined to adopt the previous policy of the men of Missouri. This was not all. Word had come that forces from Nauvoo were moving to the aid of the Mormons at Morley, where upon the gentiles throughout all that region banded, threatening to burn and drive out the saints until not one should remain. As a beginning, Buel's flouring mill and carding machine, near Lima, the property of a Mormon, was reduced to ashes.33 And now the men of Quincy, their old friends and benefactors, turned against them; and though not manifesting the deadly hate displayed in some quar ters, were nevertheless resolved that the Mormons should depart from the state.

It was a rough element, that by which they were surrounded, an element which brought upon them more of evil than of good. Compara tively few additions were made to their number from the bold border men of Missouri and Illinois, most of their proselytes coming from other parts of the United States and from Europe. The whole great west was open to them; even during the days of Joseph there had been talk of some happy Arca dian retreat far away from every adverse influence;38 and in the fertile brain of Brigham the idea assumed proportions yet broader and of more intensified form, significant of western empire and isolation somewhere in California or the Pacific isles, with himself as leader, and followers drawn from every quarter of the globe. A general council was held on the 9th of Septem ber, at which it was resolved that a company of fifteen hundred men be selected to go to Salt Lake Valley, and a committee of five was appointed to gather in formation relative to the subject.36 There were fre quent meetings of the authorities and consultations in regard to emigrating to California.37 The saints would go, they said, but they must have a reasonable time in which to dispose of their prop- 35 On the 20th of Feb., 1844, according to the Millennial Star, xxii. 819, Joseph counselled the twelve to send out a delegation and ' investigate the locations of California and Oregon, and hunt out a good location where we can remove to after the temple is completed, where we can build a city in a day and have a government of our o wn.

His empire, the empire of his people, was established, and the powers of hell should not prevail against it.9 After this, with comparatively light hearts, they broke camp, and slowly wending their way westward, disappeared at length beyond the horizon, in pursuit once more of the ever-mocking phantom of home.

On the night of March 1st, when the first camp was pitched beyond Sugar Creek, after prayer they held a dance, and as the men of Iowa looked on they wondered how these homeless outcasts from Christian civilization could thus praise and make merry in view of their near abandoning of themselves to the mercies of sav ages and wild beasts.10 Food and raiment were pro vided for all; for shelter they had their tents and wagons, and after the weather had spent somewhat of its ruggedness, no extreme hardships were suffered. Without attempting long distances in a single day, they made camp rather early, and after the usual manner of emigrants, the wagons in a circle or semi circle round the camp-fire, placed so as best to shield them from the wind and wild beasts and Indians, with the animals at a convenient distance, some staked, and some running loose, but all carefully guarded.

Leaving here the advance portion of the emigra tion, let us return to Nauvoo and see how it fared with those who were still engaged in preparations for their pilgrimage. It had been stipulated, the reader will remember, that the Mormons should remove from the state in the spring, or as soon afterward as they could sell their property, and that meanwhile they should not be molested. Long before spring, thou sands had crossed the Mississippi, among whom were all the more obnoxious members of the sect. Mean- while, how had the gentiles kept their faith ?

Warren, who had disbanded his troops on the 1st, received an order from the governor on the following day to mus ter them into service again. This he did; for he would, if possible, see the treaty between the Mor mons and the governor faithfully carried out, and while urging the saints to haste, he endeavored to stand between them and the mob which now threat ened their lives and the destruction of their prop erty.18 Major Warren appears to have performed his duty firmly and well, and to have done all that lay in his power to protect the Mormons. In a letter to the Quincy Whig, dated May 20th, he writes: \"The Mor mons are leaving the city with all possible despatch. During the week four hundred teams have crossed at three points, or about 1,350 souls. The demonstra tions made by the Mormon people are unequivocal. They are leaving the state, and preparing to leave, with every means God and nature have placed in their hands.\" It was but the lower class of people that clamored for the immediate expulsion of the remnant of the saints \u2014 the ignorant, the bigoted, the brutal, the vicious, the lawless, and profligate, those who hated their religion and coveted their lands. 18 'Thus while with one hand he pushed the saints from their possessions across the river to save their lives, with the other he kept at bay the savage fiends who thirsted for blood, and who would fain have washed their hands in the blood of innocence, and feasted their eyes on the smoking ruins of their martyred victims.' Id., 24-5. From Nauvoo, May 11, 1846, Warren writes: 'To the Mormons I would say, Go on with your preparations, and leave as fast as you can. Leave the fighting to be done by my detachment. If we are overpowered, then recross the river and defend yourselves and property. The neighboring counties, under the circumstances, cannot and will not lend their aid to an unprovoked and unnecessary attack upon the Mormons at this time; and without such aid the few desperadoes in the county can do but little mis chief, and can be made amenable to the law for that little. The force under my command is numerically small; but backed as I am by the moral force of the law, and possessing as I do the confidence of nine tenths of the respect able portion of the old citizens, my force is able to meet successfully any mob which can be assembled in the county, and if any such force does assem ble, they or I will leave the field in double-quick time.'"], [279, "MORE TROUBLE AT CARTHAGE. 225 On the 6th of June the people of Hancock county met at Carthage to arrange for celebrating the 4th of July. One of the citizens rose and said that since the Mormons were not all removed they could not rejoice as freemen. Mormon affairs then took prece dence, and another meeting was appointed for the 12th, an invitation being sent to the gentiles at Nauvoo who had occupied the deserted dwellings of the saints. It happened that this was the day appointed for the assembling of the militia, with a view to raise volun teers for the Mexican war; and now, it was thought, was a good opportunity to show the Mormons the military strength of the county. The officers con ferred, and without authority from the governor, marched their troops, some three or four hundred in number, to a place called Golden Point, five miles from Nauvoo, where they encamped, and opened com munication with the city. It happened, however, at this juncture, that Colonel Markham and others had returned with teams from Council Bluffs for some of the church property, and arming a force of six or eight hundred, prepared to sally forth; the name of Colonel Markham was a terror to evil-doers, and the militia fled, no one pursuing them. There were yet remaining, as late as August, cer tain sturdy saints who, having committed no crime, would not consent to be driven from their homes or barred from their occupations. Among these was a party engaged in harvesting wheatat a settlement eight miles from Nauvoo, in company with one or two of the gentiles, although it was forbidden by the men of Illi nois that any Mormon should show himself outside the city, except en route for the west. The harvesters were seized and beaten with clubs, whereupon the people of Nauvoo, both Mormons and gentiles, took up the matter. Some arrests were made, and the culprits taken to Nauvoo, but by writ of habeas cor pus were removed to Quincy, where they met with little trouble. While in Nauvoo, a gun in the hands Hist.

Pickets took possession of the weapon, and a warrant was issued against him for theft; when an officer came to arrest him, he refused to surrender. As the Mormons stood by him in illegal attitude, the affair caused consider able excitement. In short, from the 1st of May until the final evac uation of the city, the men of Illinois never ceased from strife and outrage. Of the latter I will mention only two instances: \"A man of near sixty years of age,\" writes Major Warren in the letter just referred to, \" living about seven miles from this place, was taken from his house a few nights since, stripped of his clothing, and his back cut to pieces with a whip, for no other reason than because he was a Mormon, and too old to make a successful resistance. Conduct of this kind would disgrace a horde of savages.\" In August a party consisting of Phineas H. Young, his son Brigham, and three others who were found out side the city, were kidnapped by a mob, hurried into the thickets, passed from one gang to another \u2014 men from Nauvoo being in hot pursuit \u2014 and for a fort night were kept almost without food or rest, and under constant threat of death. Fears are now entertained that, by reason of the popular feeling throughout the country, Nauvoo city will be again attacked; the gentile citizens therefore ask Governor Ford for protection, whereupon Major Parker is sent to their relief.19 All through August 19 'Sir \u2014 I have received information that another effort is to be made on Monday next to drive out the inhabitants of Nauvoo, new as well as old, and destroy the city.

Before the end of the month about six hundred men are assembled at Car thage, by order of Thomas Carlin, a special consta ble, ostensibly to enforce the arrest of Pickett, but in reality to enforce the expulsion of the Mormons. Major Parker orders the constable's posse to dis perse, otherwise he threatens to treat them as a mob. The constable replies that if the major should at tempt to molest them in discharge of their duty he will regard him and his command as a mob and so treat them. \"Now, fellow-citizens,\" declares a committee selected from four counties,20 in a proclamation issued at Carthage, \"an issue is fairly raised. On the one hand, a large body of men have assembled at Carthage, under the command of a legal officer, to assist him in performing legal duties.

They were sore disgusted, and rebelled against their leaders, causing Singleton, Parker, and others to abandon their commands, the posse being left in charge of Constable Carlin, who summoned to his aid one Thomas Brockman, a clergy- man of Brown county, and for the occasion clubbed general. On the 10th of September the posse, now more than a thousand strong, with wagons, equip- ments, and every preparation for a campaign, ap- proached Nauvoo and encamped at Hunter's farm. At this time there were in the city not more than a hundred and fifty Mormons, and about the same number of gentiles, or, as they were termed, 'new citi- zens,' capable of bearing arms, the remainder of the population consisting of destitute women and children and of the sick. Many of the gentiles had departed, fearing a general massacre, and those who remained could not be relied upon as combatants, for they were of course unwilling to risk their lives in a conflict which, if successful, would bring them no credit. Nothing daunted, the little band, under command of colonels Daniel H. Wells22 and William Cutler, took up its position on the edge of a wood in the suburbs of Nauvoo, and less than a mile from the enemy's camp.23 Before hostilities commenced, a deputation from Quincy24 visited the camp of the assailants, and in vain attempted to dissuade them from their purpose.

For instance: 'Seeing our men take possession of some vacant buildings on the line of their ap proach, they took a position on an elevated spot of ground, and opened a heavy cannonade at a distance of something less than half a mile.

Their property in Hancock co., Illinois, was little or no better than confiscated; many of their houses were burned by the mob, and they were obliged to leave most of those that remained without sale; and those who bargained sold almost for a song; for the influence of their enemies was to cause such a diminution in the value of property that for a handsome estate was seldom realized enough to remove the family comfortably away; and thousands have since been wandering to and fro, destitute, afflicted, and distressed for the common necessaries of life, or unable to endure, have sickened and died by hundreds; while the temple of the Lord is left solitary in the midst of our enemies, an enduring monu ment of the diligence aud integrity of the saints.' Mention of the expulsion from Nauvoo is of course made in most of the books published on Mormon ism, but in none of them, except perhaps in one or two of the most rabid anti-Mormon works, which I have not thought it worth while to notice, is the conduct of the Illinois mob defended."], [286, "EXPULSION FROM NAUVOO. 232 culturists in the regions about, citizens of the United States, driven beyond the border by other citizens : not by reason of their religion alone, though this wasniade a pretence ; not for breaking the laws, though this was made a pretence; not on account of their immorality, for the people of Illinois and Missouri were not im maculate in this respect; nor was it altogether on account of their solid voting and growing political power, accompanied ever by the claim of general in heritance and universal dominion, though this last had more to do with it probably than all the rest combined, notwithstanding that the spirit of liberty and the laws of the republic permitted such massing of social and political influence, and notwithstanding the obvious certainty that any of the gentile political parties now playing the role of persecutors would gladly and unscrupulously have availed themselves of such means for the accomplishment of their ends. It was all these combined, and so combined as to engen der deadly hate. It gave the Mormons a power in proportion to their numbers not possessed by other sects or societies, which could not and would not endure it; a power regarded by the others as unfairly acquired, and by a way and through means not in accord with the American idea of individual equality, of equal rights and equal citizenship. In regard to all other sects within the republic, under guard of the consti tution, religion was subordinated to politics and gov ernment; in regard to the Mormons, in spite of the constitution, politics and government were subordi nated to religion.

For months thereafter there were periods when all the flour they used was of the coarsest, the wheat being ground in coffee and hand mills, which only cut the grain ; others used a pestle ; the finer meal was used for bread, the coarser made into hominy. Boiled wheat was now the chief diet for sick and well. For ten days they subsisted on parched corn. Some mixed their remnant of grain with the pounded bark of the slippery elm which they stripped from the trees along their route. This encampment was about two miles above Montrose on the Mississippi, and was called the Poor Camp. Aid was solicited, and within three weeks a little over one hundred dollars was collected, mostly in Quincy, with provisions and clothing, though the prejudice against them was deep and strong.35 Some of the people were crowded into tents, made frequently of quilts and blankets; others in bowers made of brush ; others had only wagons for shelter. They suffered from heavy thunder-storms, when the rain was bailed out with basins from their beds. Mothers huddled their children in the one dress which often was all they possessed, and shaking with ague or burning with fever, took refuge from the pitiless storms under wagons and bushes.38 13 While at Montrose, Heber C. Kimball writes thus in his journal of the condition of his family, his wife having a babe a few days old, and he himself ill with ague. ' I went to the bed; my wife, who was shaking with the ague, having two children lying sick by her side;. . .the only child well was little Heber Parley, and it was with difficulty he could carry a two-quart pail full of water from a spring at the bottom of the hill.' 34 ' Such deaths occurred from exposure and fright in Nauvoo.

So long had they been lashed by the fierce winds of misfortune, that now they accepted with gratitude this indication of providential care. Wagons were sent from Winter Quarters for the removal of the people from Poor Camp; and gradually all reached the various stations in which the Mormons had gathered.38 Of their long journey many painful incidents are recorded. Weakened by fever or crippled with rheu matism, and with sluggish circulation, many were severely frost-bitten. Women were compelled to drive the nearly worn-out teams, while tending on their knees, perhaps, their sick children. The strength of the beasts was failing, as there were intervals when they could be kept from starving only by the browse or tender buds and branches of the cotton-wood, felled for the purpose.39 At one time no less than two thousand wagons could be counted, it was said, along the three hundred miles of road that separated Nauvoo from the Mor mon encampments.

When they turned their back on Nauvoo, the whole western coast was before them, with its multitudinous mountains and valleys, its rivers and lakes, and long line of seaboard. Of the several parts of this immense territory, ownership and right of occupation were not in every instance de termined. The question of the boundary line between England's possessions and those of the United States had stirred up no small discussion and feeling, and out of the present war with Mexico would doubtless arise some changes.7 It was a foregone conclusion in the minds of many, before ever the migratory saints had reached the Missouri River, that when the pres ent troubles with Mexico were ended the United States would have California. But however this might be, the saints had a firm reliance on an overruling providence, and once adrift upon the vast untenanted west, their God and their sagacity would point out to them their future home. Thus it was that while the Mormons in the western states took the route over land, another portion living at the east took passage round Cape Horn, the intention being that the two bodies of brethren should come together somewhere upon the Pacific slope, which indeed they did.8 The national title to what is now the Pacific United States being at this time thus unsettled, and the Mormons having: been driven from what was then ' In a letter to Pres.

But it was not necessary that they should hold possession of such lands in opposition to the government of the United States, as they have been charged with doing. They now applied to the government at Washing ton for work, offering to open roads, transport mili tary stores, or perform any other service which the government might require in this farthest west, even to assist in fighting its battles. Such occupation would be of the greatest advantage to them in this new country, where land was fertile and plenty and free, and possessing as they did large herds of cattle and horses and sheep, with no market and but little money. And on the other hand, being on the ground, accustomed to work, and having every facility at hand without long and expensive transportation, they could give more and better work for the pay than the government could obtain by any other means. They even asked for aid direct about the time the exodus began, being represented at Washington by Elder Jesse C.

The Mormons were true-hearted Americans, the memo rial went on to say, and if the government would assist them in their present emergency, the petitioner stood ready to pledge himself as their representative to answer any call the government might make upon them for service on the field of battle. Elder Little was taken at his word. At a cabinet meeting, held a day or two after his petition was pre sented, the president advised that the elder be sent at once to the Mormon camps, and there raise a thousand men to take possession of California in the name of the United States, while a thousand more be sent by way of Cape Horn for the same purpose, on board a United States transport. It was finally arranged that the elder, in company with Kane, should proceed westward, the latter bearing despatches to Kearny, then at Fort Leavenworth, with a view to raising a corps of about five hundred men. On the 19th of June, Kearny issued an order tc Captain James Allen of the 1st dragoons to pro ceed to the Mormon camp, and there raise four or five companies of volunteers, to be mustered into the service of the United States and receive the pay and rations of other infantry volunteers.

And this idea, which was wholly at variance with the facts, is present in the minds of some even to this day. In order to facilitate enlisting, or for some other cause best known to himself, Brigham deemed it best to preserve this idea rather than wholly disabuse their minds of it; for in his address to the brethren on the 15th of July he said: ' If we want the privilege of going where we can worship God accord ing to the dictates of our consciences, we must raise the battalion.

While all this carried weight, the bounty of twenty thousand dollars was no insignificant consideration, nor the hope that this battalion might serve as van guard to Brigham's host, provided he carried out his partially formed purpose to settle in California. At the close of 1846, about twelve thousand souls had assembled in the Mormon camps, a portion of them being yet stationed as far eastward as Garden Grove. Of the rest a few had made their way to some Atlantic port and taken ship for Califor nia; many had dispersed throughout the country, some of whom were now gathering at the ren dezvous. Though the first bands that crossed the Mississippi encountered no very severe hardships, as I have said, the sufferings of those who set forth later have few parallels, even among the pioneers, who, a year or two afterward, followed their track westward in search of gold.21 Mount Pisgah, the next encampment west of Gar den Grove, was on the middle fork of Grand River. Through this winter of 1846-7, which was one of severest struggle, there was great lack of food and clothing.

'Our situation was pitiable; I had no suitable food for myself or my child; the severe rain prevented our having any fire; on the third day we resumed our journey. In ten days we reached Mt Pisgah; my little girl was very ill, and I was also.

In the spring of 1847, Lorenzo Snow was made president of the camp. The men were put to work wherever they could get it. Seed was planted, and the result was enough not only for themselves, but they were enabled to send supplies to the camp at Council Bluffs.23 Snow instituted religious ceremonies and amusements to brighten and encourage them. He describes a dance in his log cabin, where clean straw was spread over the ground floor, and the walls draped with sheets. Turnips were scooped out and in them were placed lighted candles, which, suspended from the ceiling of earth and cane, or fastened on the walls, imparted a picturesque effect. Dancing, speeches, songs, and recitations varied the exercises, which opened and closed with prayer. On each side of the hills where now stands Council Bluffs could be seen the white canvas tents of a Mor- mon encampment, from which arose at sunrise the smoke of hundreds of fires. After the morning meal, the men employed themselves in tending herds, in planting grain and vegetables, or in building houses for winter. Many of them were excellent craftsmen, and could fell a tree, and split its trunk into boards, scantling, rails, posts, or whatever were needed, as 29 It cannot be said that any considerable number died of starvation.

In the autumn drought, the streams that discharge into the Missouri at this point are often little better than open sewers, pestilential as open cesspools, and the river, having lost more than half its volume, flows sluggishly through its channel of slime and sedge. Of the baked mud on either bank is formed the rich soil on which lay the encampments, the site being called, in their own phrase, Misery Bottom. In the year previous the Indians in this neighborhood had lost one ninth of their number; and now that the earth was for the first time upturned by the plough, the exhalations from this rank and steaming soil were redolent of disease and death. In the camp nearest to Papillon more than one third of the company lay sick at the beginning of August; elsewhere matters were even worse; and as the season advanced there were in some of the en campments not one who escaped the fever, the few who were able to stagger from tent to tent carrying food and water to their comrades. For several weeks it was impossible to dig graves quickly enough for the burial of the dead,25 and one might see in the open tents the wasted forms of women brushing away the flies from the putrefying corpses of their children. Through all these months building was continually going on at Winter Quarters.26 The axe and saw were 24 ' There were among them many skilled mechanics, who could work at forge, loom, or turning-lathe.

Great difficulty was experi enced in getting flour and meal; a little grain was ground at the government mill, and the rest was ob tained in Missouri, a hundred and fifty miles distant.23 Brigham kept everybody busy, and everything was well organized and systematically executed.20 Schools were soon established, officers of the church appointed, and men sent on missions.

In transporting the goods from St Louis later, ferriage became so high and prices were so advanced that the brethren burst forth: 'Woe unto you, Missourians! but we are independent of them and can live without them, for we have thousands of cattle left.' 29 'At a meeting of the council July 14th, it was voted that colonies be established on the east side of the river to put in buckwheat, and wiuter; that a fort be built on Grand Island and a settlement made there; and that Bishop Miller and a company go over the mountains.'

Some twelve hundred cattle were herded on the rush bottoms, about a hundred miles up the river. The building of a water flouring mill was in process of construction, and Brigham superintended the work. As the camp journalist writes: \"He sleeps with one eye open and one foot out of bed, and when anything is wanted he is on hand.\" The tithing collected was distributed among the destitute at Mount Pisgah. To the gentiles who visited their camps such hospitality was extended as their means permitted, which though often scant was never stinted. Within the camp the women attended not only to their ordinary household duties, but were busily occu pied spinning, knitting, making leggings from deer and elk skins, and in weaving willow baskets for market.30 With cheerfulness and courage they adapted them selves to their many vicissitudes, their faith in their religion never swerving, and supported by it to a pa tient endurance beyond human strength. Most of them had exchanged their household treasures and personal effects, even to their table and bed furniture, for stores of maize or flour, which with milk were their only articles of diet. As evening approached, the tinkling of cattle bells announced the return of the men, when the women went forth to meet them, and welcome them back to their log hut and frugal meal. Then a little later all sounds were hushed, save that on the still night arose the strains of the evening hymn and the murmur of the evening prayer, the day closing, as it had commenced, with a supplication for the blessing of the Almighty, and with heartfelt thanksgiving that he had been pleased to deliver hi? people from the hands of their persecutors.

They had 73 wagons drawn by horses and mules, and loaded chiefly with grain and farming implements,2 and with provisions which were expected to last them for the return journey. Early in April a detachment moved out of Winter Quarters for the rendezvous on the Elkhorn, and on the 14th the pioneer band, accompanied by eight mem bers of the council,3 began the long journey westward in search of a site for their new Zion.

'Wait a little,' said the president, 'and we will show you.' Again, on p. 45 he says that, being encamped on what is now known as Tar Springs, the pioneers were met by a mountaineer named Goodyear, who had wintered on the site of the present city of Ogden, after planting grain and vegetables in the valley, but with meagre results. The mountaineer's report was very discouraging, but to him also Brigham replied, 'Give us time and we will show you.'' There is no evidence that as yet the president knew anything about the Salt Lake Valley except what he heard from Bridger and Goodyear, or had gleaned from the reports of Fremont's expedition.

Then to avoid a desert stretch, down the Big Sandy to its junction with Green River, and across, then up Black's Fork to junction with Ham's Fork, and thence up Black's Fork to Fort Bridger. The Mormons here took the road made by Hastings and the Donner company in 1S46, bearing almost due west, crossing Bear River, down Echo Canon to junction with the Weber. The Mormons here chose the Donner trail, which passed up the Weber southerly from Echo about twelve miles, then westerly into Parley's Park, then across the hills northerly to the head of Emigration Cation, then into the valley. As the Donner company had passed over this route more recently than any other, it seems to have been followed as probably the best, and was usually travelled for many years.

The primeval silence is now broken; the primeval songs are now disturbed by sounds strange to the surrounding hills, accustomed only to the music of running water and the notes of birds and wild beasts. There is the rumbling of the caravan as it comes slowly picking its way down the dark ravine, the tramping of the horses upon the hard ground, and the grinding of the wheels among the rocks as they plunge down one bank and climb another, or thread their way along the narrow ledge overhanging an abyss, the songs of Israel meanwhile being heard, and midst the cracking of whips the shouts now and then breaking forth of a leader in Israel awe-struck by the grandeur of the scene, \"Hosanna to the Lord! hosanna to the creator of all I hallelujah! hallelujah!\" Emerging from the ravine upon a bench or terrace, they behold the lighted valley, the land of promise, the place of long seeking which shall prove a place of rest, a spot whereon to plant the new Jerusalem, a spot of rare and sacred beauty.

It was near this terrace, being in fact a mile and a half up the canon, that Orson Pratt and Erastus Snow, with their detachment of pioneers, encamped on the 20th of July, 1847. Next day, the ever-mem orable 21st, to reach this bench, whence was viewed with such marvellous effect the warm, pulsating pano rama before them, Pratt and Snow crept on their hands and knees, warned by the occasional rattle of a snake, through the thick underbrush which lined the south side of the mountain and filled the canon s mouth, leaving their companions on the other side of the brush. After drinking in the scene to the satis faction of their souls, they descended to the open plain, Snow on horseback, with his coat thrown loosely upon his saddle, and Pratt on foot. They journeyed westward three miles, when Snow missing his coat turned back, and Pratt continued alone. After trav ersing the site of the present city, and standing where later was temple block, he rejoined his comrade at the mouth of the canon. Together they then returned to camp late in the evening and told of their discoveries. The following morning the advance company, com posed of Orson Pratt, George A. Smith,16 and seven others, entered the valley and encamped on the bank of Canon Creek. They explored the valley toward the lake, and about three miles from the camp found two fine streams with stony bottoms, whose banks promised sufficient pasturage. Proceeding northward, they found hot springs at the base of the mountain spur. Upon their return they were greeted by the working camp five miles from the mouth of the canon, at what was subsequently known as Parley Canon 16 Geo. A.

Pratt called the men together, dedicated the land to the Lord, and prayed for his blessing on the seeds about to be planted and on the labors of the saints. Before noon a committee re- turned a report that they had staked off land suitable for crops; that the soil was friable, and composed of loam and gravel. The first furrow was thereupon turned by William Carter, and through the afternoon three ploughs and one harrow were at work. A dam was commenced and trenches cut to convey water to the fields. Toward evening their energetic labors were interrupted by a thunder-storm.19 The ground was so dry that they found it necessary to irrigate it before ploughing, some ploughs having been broken; and it was not until after the arrival of Brigham that planting was begun. The coming of the leader had been impatiently awaited, although in their ambition to have as much as possible accomplished, the time quickly passed. Brigham was slowly following with the remainder of the company, and was still so weak as to be obliged to be carried on a bed in Wilford Wordruff's carriage. As they reached a point on Big Mountain where the view was unbroken, the carriage was turned into proper position, and Brigham arose from his bed and surveyed the country.

The ground was covered with millions of black crickets which the Indians were harvesting for their winter food.2* An unusual number of natives had assembled for this pur pose, and after dinner gathered about the new-comers, evincing great curiosity as to their plans.

Certain fines were im posed as a penalty for disobedience; for fuel only dead timber was allowed, and while there was sufficient, the restraint excited some opposition.25 The next day was the sabbath; and as had been the custom at Nauvoo, two services were held, George A.

One cause for thankfulness was that not a man or an ani mal had died on the journey.

An hour later it was agreed that a site should be laid out for a city in blocks or squares of ten acres, and in lots of an acre and a quarter, the streets to be eight rods wide, with side walks of twenty feet. At eight o'clock on the same evening a meeting was held on the temple square, and it was decided by vote that on that spot the temple should be built,29 and from that spot the city laid out. On the 29th of July a detachment of the battal ion, which had wintered at Pueblo,30 to the number of 150, under Captain James Brown, arrived in the val ley ; they were accompanied by fifty of the brethren who had started the year previous from the Missis sippi.

In taking lunar dis tances for longitude, it is usual to have four observers, but Orson Pratt had no assistant; hence probably the discrepancy.

The winter was passed quietly and in content, most of the saints preparing for their migration in the spring. Meanwhile, on the 23d of December, 1847, a general epistle of the twelve was issued to the brethren and to the gentiles. In this it was stated that they were at peace with all the world, that their mission was to extend salvation to the ends of the earth, and an invitation was extended to \" all presi dents, and emperors, and kings, and princes, and no bles, and governors, and rulers, and judges, and all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people under the whole heaven, to come and help us to build .a house to the name of the God of Jacob, a place of peace, a city of rest, a habitation for the oppressed of every clime.\" Then followed an exhortation for the saints to gather unto Zion, promising that their reward should be a hundred-fold and their rest glorious.

P. Rockwell, E. K. Fuller, A. A. Lathrop, and fifteen others set forth for California to buy cows, mules, mares, wheat, and seeds. They bought two hundred head of cows at six dollars each, with which they started from Cali fornia, but lost forty head on the Mojave; being ninety days on the return trip. During the autumn, several parties of the battalion men arrived from California, bringing a quantity of wheat. Captain Grant came to Salt Lake City from Fort Hall in December to arrange for opening trade between the two points. After due discussion, the matter was referred to the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company. In regard to affairs at Pueblo and on the Missouri, I am indebted for further and later information to my esteemed friends Wilbur F. Stone and William N. Byers of Colorado. A detachment of the Mormons that wintered at Pueblo underwent many hardships, and there have been found relics in that vicinity, in the shape of furnace and cinders, significant of their industrial occupation at the time. On the Missouri, the Indians, who at first had so heartily welcomed the saints during the year 1847, complained to the government that they were intrud ing on their domain. The government therefore ordered away the Mormons, but gave them permis sion to occupy lands on the east bank of the river for five years. There they built a town, named Kanesville, opposite Omaha, and occupied the best part of the country up and down the left bank of the river for a distance of twenty miles in each direction. Many of them lived in dugouts, that is, artificial caves made by digging out a space for occupancy in the bank of the river or on the side of a bluff. Most worth, William; Young, Brigham; Clarissa D.

Hereabout they built many log houses, Brigham having a little cluster of them for his wives 0 0 in a cosey nook apart from the others. On their final departure for the west, the Mormons left a f\u00abw of their number under A. J. Mitchell, who was assisted by A. J. Smith. They lived on the east side of the Missouri at first, and had a ferry across the river as early as 1851, with other ferries west, one at Loup Fork, and one on the Elkhorn. A large emigration up the river from New Orleans set in about this time. In the spring of 1852 the steamboat Sa luda, having six hundred souls on board, was blown up at the mouth of the Platte. In 1854 the lands of the Omahas, on the west side of the river, came into market, through a treaty made during the summer of that year with the natives, who ceded that section to the United States. Mitchell and Smith then moved to the western side, and changed the name of Winter Quarters to that of Florence, at the same time selling their interests on the eastern side to the gentiles, who changed the name of Kanesville to that of Council Bluffs."], [329, "CHAPTER XI IN THE VALLEY OF THE GREAT SALT LAKE. 1848.

At the opening of January 1848, the saints were housed, clad, and fed in moderate comfort, and general content prevailed.1 The season was exceptionally mild; there were occasional light falls of snow, but not enough to interfere with ploughing and sowing,8 and a large tract of land was partially enclosed and planted with wheat and vegetables. So many people were now in the valley that not withstanding the abundant crops food at length be came scarce. Families weighed out their flour and allowed themselves so much a day.

Butter and tallow were needed. One wild steer, well fattened, was brought in from Goodyear 's rancho. A herd of deer crossing from one range of mountains to another was startled by the unexpected obstruction of the fort, and one sprang into the enclosure and was killed. Wild sago and parsnip roots constituted the vegetable food of the settlers. A few deaths occurred from poisonous roots. The bracing air and hard work stimulated appetite as stores decreased. For coffee parched bar ley and wheat were used, and as their sugar gave out, they substituted some of home manufacture.4 In the spring thistle tops were eaten, and became an impor tant article of diet.6 Anxiety began to be felt about clothing, and the hand-looms were now busily at work, although wool was scarce.6 As shoes wore out, moccasins were sub stituted, and goat, deer, and elk skins were manu factured into clothing for men and women, though most unsuitable for use in rain and snow. At the time of Parley P. Pratt's arrival, the city of Great Salt Lake consisted of a fort enclosing a block of ten acres, the walls of part of the buildings being of adobes and logs.

Wagon-boxes were also brought into line, and served for habitations until better accom modations were provided. The houses were built of logs, and were placed close together, the roofs slanting inward, and all the doors and windows being on the inside, with a loop-hole to each room on the outside. As everything indicated a dry climate, the roofs were made rather flat, and great inconvenience resulted. In March the rains were very heavy, and umbrellas were used to protect women and children while cook ing, and even in bed. The clay found in the bottoms near the fort made excellent plaster, but would not stand exposure to rain, and quickly melted. All bread stuffs were carefully gathered into the centre of the rooms, and protected with buffalo skins obtained from the Indians.

The table was a chest, and the bedstead was built into the corner of the house, which formed two of its sides, rails or poles forming the opposite sides; pegs were driven into the walls and rails, and the bed-cord tightly wound around them.10 The chim neys were of adobe, and sometimes there was a fire place in the corner wiln a clay hearth. In the early part of the year two brass cannon were purchased at Sutter's Fort for the church, by the battalion brethren.11 During the winter of 1847-8, some Indian children were brought to the fort to be sold. At first two were offered, but the settlers peremptorily refused to buy them. The Indian in charge said that the chil dren were captured in war, and would be killed at sunset if the white men did not buy them. Thereupon they purchased one of them, and the one not sold was shot. Later, several Indians came in with two more children, using the same threat; they were bought and brought up at the expense of the settlers.12 Measles now appeared for the first time among the natives, who did not know where the disease came from or what to do.

Men, women, and children turned out en masse to combat this pest, driving them into ditches or on to piles of reeds, which they would set on fire, striving in every way, until strength was exhausted, to beat back the devouring host.

They were of a kind popularly called iron-clad, and did much mischief.20 Though the crops of this year of 1848 were thus saved from total destruction, fears were entertained that there would not be food enough for those already in the valley, and the expected arrival of large additional numbers was looked upon as a calamity.21 The stock of provisions was therefore husbanded with care, many living principally on roots and \" Kane says that the gulls soon grew to be as tame as poultry, and that the children called them their pigeons.

To those who met them on the route, the strict order of their march, their coolness and rapidity in closing ranks to repel assault, their method in posting sentries around camp and corral, suggested rather the movements of a well-organized army than the migration of a people; and in truth, few armies have been better organized or more ably led than was this army of the Lord.27 To the skill of their leaders, and their own concert of purpose and action, was due their preservation.

Fencing material being scarce, and the city lands all appropriated, it was proposed that a large field for farming purposes adjoin ing the city should be selected and fenced in com mon. By October there were 863 applications for lots, amounting to 11,005 acres. A united effort was made to fence the city, which was done by enclosing each ward in one field, and re quiring the owner of every lot to build his proportion of the fence.30 No lots were allowed to be held for speculation, the intention, originally, being to assign them only to those who would occupy and improve them. The farming land nearest the city was sur veyed in five-acre lots to accommodate the mechanics and artisans ; next beyond were ten-acre lots, followed by forty and eighty acres, where farmers could build and reside. All these farms were enclosed in one common fence, constituting what was called the 'big field,' before mentioned.31 28 ' In July 1848, William and Nathan Hawks, Sanford Jacobs, and Rich ard Slater came from California with copies of Brannan's Star of April 1st, and tidings that the brethren at San Francisco were doing well, and that those who had settled on the San Joaquin River had vacated in favor of the mosquitoes.'

Many still subsisted mainly on roots, thistles, and even on rawhides.1 Milk, flesh, and the small quantity of breadstuff's that remained were, however, distributed among the poor in such quantities as to prevent actual starvation. On April 1, 1849, each household was required to state the smallest allowance of breadstuffs that would suffice until the forth-coming harvest.

On dividing the town into lots, each received his plat, and so with fields, for south of the town lay a field of 6 square miles, cultivated in common; this was divided into 5 acre square lots and given to heads of families, by lot or distribution, in tracts of one to eight lots each.

In September, Brigham had brought eighty-four dollars in small change into the valley, which had been distributed, but was no longer in cir culation. On the 6th of January, resolutions were passed by the council to the effect that \"the Kirtland bank bills be put into circulation for the accommodation of the people, thus fulfilling the prophecy of Joseph, that the Kirtland notes would one day be as good as gold.\" The first printing was in connection with the manufacture of paper money.10 Previous to the issue of this currency an attempt was made by John Kay to coin gold-dust, but the crucibles broke in the attempt. All the dies and everything connected with the coining were made in Salt Lake City.11 Subsequent attempts were more successful. The coin was made of pure gold, without alloy, which made it deficient in weight; it was there fore sold as bullion. Brigham then proposed the issue of paper currency until gold could be coined.12 There was also a paper currency issued some years later by a company in Salt Lake City known as the Des eret Currency Association, its capital being in cattle, but this was merely a temporary convenience.13 Cur- 10 Fifty-cent and one-dollar paper currency was issued.

Several of the adobe houses in the fort had fallen down from the effects of the thaw. When'at last they had learned how to make adobes, they were of the best kind. Alkali at first was mixed with the clay, which, when exposed to rain, would expand and burst the bricks. After this year more commodious structures were erected for public and private use, the means being supplied in part by traffic with emigrants for California, Conspicuous among them was the council-house on East Temple street, a two-story stone edifice, forty -five feet square,15 used originally for church purposes, and afterward occupied by the state and territorial legislatures. In front of the council-house was temple block, on the south-west corner of which stood the tabernacle, built in 1851-2, on the ground now occupied by the assem bly hall, with accommodation for 2,500 persons,16 and consecrated on April 6th of the latter year.17 Dur- 14 See chap, xix., note 44, this vol. 15 'I was appointed superintendent of public works in the fall of 184S.

The latter was to be built of stone quarried in the mountains, and a railroad from temple block to the quarry was chartered for the conveyance of building material. Adjoining the tabernacle was the bowery, 100 by 60 feet, made of posts and boarding, completed three or four years later, and large enough to contain 8,000 people, a temporary structure having been erected in 1848. Among other buildings may be mentioned the tithing office, the social hall, and the seventies' hall of science. Several bridges were also built, which were paid for by the one per centum property tax.18 Thus at the western base of the Wasatch Moun tains was laid out the city of Great Salt Lake, its buildings being distributed over a greater area than that on which stood, in 1850, the commercial metrop olis of the United States.19 Its site was on a slope, barely perceptible except toward the north, where it was enclosed by the Wasatch Range and a spur trend ing to the westward. Resting on the eastern bank of the Jordan, it was watered by several creeks; a canal, twelve miles long, crossing three streams, being pro posed to convey the waters of the Big Cottonwood to the farm-lands south of the city; and through each street flowed a rivulet of pure water, which was thence diverted into the garden plats.

The procession was then re-formed and marched to the feast served on tables fourteen hundred feet in length. \"The tables were heavily loaded,\" says Brigham, \"with all the lux uries of field and garden, and with nearly all the vege tables of the world; the seats were filled and refilled by a people who had been deprived of those luxuries for years, and they welcomed to their table every stranger within their border.\"21 A greater variety was provided, as the saints had exchanged for many luxuries their flour, butter, potatoes, and other pro duce, with passing emigrants.

All entertain ments were opened with prayer; then came dancing, songs, and music, followed by supper, theguests being dismissed with a benediction at an early hour. The public festivities of the Mormons were always conducted under the auspices of the church, and none were allowed to join in them who were not in good standing. To sing, dance, and rejoice before the Lord was regarded almost as a religious duty, but only those must rejoice whose hearts were pure and whose hands were clean.

Those who had sold liquor for gain, thereby corrupting the morals of society, were also disquali fied. All friends and well-wishers to society, all who remembered the poor and needy,26 were invited to participate, though not members of the church. But declares the council : \"Woe unto them that dance with guile and malice in their hearts toward their neigh bor! Woe unto them that have secretly injured their neighbor or his or her property! Woe unto them that are ministers of disorder and of evil! If these shall go forth in the dance without confessing and forsaking their guilt, the faith of the council is that they seal their doom by it.\" After their festivities the people returned, each to his calling, with renewed zest. It was an article of faith among them that labor was honorable, and all who were not missionaries were expected to do their part. By revelation, Joseph Smith was released from this obligation, but Brigham Young worked as a car penter in his own mills. Labor was regarded as a duty no less than prayer or temple service, each one working with his hands at whatsoever he found to do, and cheerfully contributing his tithes toward the church revenues, which were expended for public im provements, for the support of missions, and the re lief of the sick and destitute.27 26 ' Bring all your tithes and offerings to the proper place for the poor, that there be none hungry among us, and let the poor rejoice; and then you may rejoice in the dance to your heart's content.' Regulations of the High Council, in Frontier Guardian, Nov. 28, 1849. Brigham, in an address at the state-house in 1852, at a party given to the legislature, said: 'I want it distinctly understood that fiddling and dancing are no part of our worship. My mind labors like a man logging. This is the reason why I am fond of these pastimes; they give me a privilege to throw everything off and shake myself, that my body may exercise and my mind rest.' And again: 'This company is controlled like the ship by the rudder in a gentle breeze, that can be turned hither and thither at the will and pleasure of him who com mands.' Hist. B.

Hundreds of emigrants, turning aside to Salt Lake City, wearied and dis pirited, their cattle worn out and their wagons broken, were glad to exchange them, together with their tools, household furniture, and spare clothing, for provisions and pack animals at very low rates.28 Many were glad to remain during winter, and work for their liveli hood. Though reports were freely circulated to the contrary, there is sufficient evidence that as a rule they were kindly treated, and not a few abandoned their search for gold to cast in their lot with the saints.29 The arrival in November of the first pack-mule train from California, laden with many luxuries and neces sities, was an important event. The people formed in line, waiting hours for their turn to buy the limited amount allowed.30 When a sack of potatoes was hourly, momentarily, rolling, piling, tumbling, and thundering upon us, you would at least conclude that there was no danger of our getting the gout from idleness or too much jollity.'

Utah Early Records, MS., 113. 2sIn the autumn of 1849 many emigrants, while resting in Salt Lake City, wrote letters to their friends, in which they acknowledged the kindness and hospitality shown them by the saints. Extracts from these letters were pub lished in newspapers throughout the states. Gunnison, The Mormons, 65, says: ' Their many deeds of charity to the sick and broken-down gold-seekers all speak loudly in their favor, and must eventually redound to their praise.'

The immigration during the season numbered some 1,400 souls, who were added to the settlers in the valley,31 and who, with the number remaining of those originally bound for California, made a large population to clothe, feed, and shelter. A carrying company was also established32 in De cember for the purpose of conveying passengers and goods from the Missouri River to the gold regions of California. In their prospectus, the proprietors set forth that, residing as they did in the valley, and be ing acquainted with the route, they could provide fresh animals as they were needed and save the loss of hundreds and thousands of dollars that had been incurred by former parties through inexperience.

In 1848 it had been prophesied by Heber C. Kimball that the commodities, known among the brethren as 'states goods,' would be as cheap in Salt Lake City as in New York; while Brigham Young, soon after setting forth from Nauvoo, had made a similar prediction, declaring that within five years his people would be more pros perous than they had ever been. Both prophecies were fulfilled,34 when, during the first years of the gold fever, company after company came pouring into Utah, which might now be termed the half-way house of the nation. Several hundred California-bound emi grants arrived in the valley in 1849, too late to con tinue their journey on the northern route, and proposed to spend the winter in the valley. There was scarcely provision enough for those already there, and as Jeffer son Hunt of the battalion offered to pilot the company over the southern route, they decided to undertake the trip, and started on the 8th of October, arrivihg in California on the 22d of December.85 On the 1st of December nineteen men came into the city on foot, nearly famished, having been two days making their way over Big Mountain.

The cattle thus obtained by the settlers, in barter, after being fattened on the nutritious grasses of the valley, were driven to California, where a sure and profitable market was found. As a result of the California-bound migration, there followed an enormous advance in the price of provi sions, flour selling before the harvest of 1850 at one dol lar per pound, and after harvest at twenty-five dollars per cental.37 Throughout the autumn of this year the grist-mills were run to their utmost capacity, grinding wheat for the passing emigrants, who at any cost must procure sufficient to carry them to the gold mines.

For men who had fed during their first winter in the valley on hides and roots, it was no great hardship to dispense for a season with a portion of their provisions, their grain, beef, and butter, their coffee and sugar, in return for which they received such value. It was not of course to be expected that while thou sands of California-bound emigrants were passing each year through the Mormon settlements, the saints should themselves entirely escape the gold fever. In November 1848, several small parties of the battalion found their way to Salt Lake City,41 some of them bringing considerable quantities of gold-dust, which, as they relate, had come into their possession in this wise.

They were no iron pyrites, however, that Marshall had found, but, as it proved, nuggets of gold, the largest of them being worth about five dollars. The discovery was revealed in confidence to three of the saints, who unearthed a few more specimens, and soon afterward removed to a sand-bar in the Sacramento river, since known as Mormon Island. Here was gold in paying quantities, the average earnings of each man being twenty to thirty dollars per day. But though dust and nuggets were freely shown to the brethren, there were few who would believe their senses, and for weeks the matter caused no excitement.

But the Indians were not to be thus intimidated. In the autumn they began to steal the grain and cattle of the white men, and one of their number being killed while in the act of pilfering, hostilities broke out and the foi-t was soon in a state of siege. Indeed, ill feeling on the part of the Indians had begun to show itself the previous year. Vasquez and Bridger wrote to Brigham on the 17th of April, 1849, that the Utes were badly disposed toward Americans, and that chiefs Elk and Walker were urging the Utes to attack the settlements in Utah Valley.

Benton at Washington.11 Alexander Williams and D.B. Hunt ington were empowered by the council to trade ex clusively with the Indians on behalf of the community.

In this encounter Joseph Higbee was killed, and Alexander Williams, Samuel Kearns, Albert Miles, Jabez Nowland, and two men named Orr and Stevens were wounded. On the 11th the Indians fled from the thicket to Rock Canon, whither the volunteers pursued them; but failing to find them, the white men proceeded to the west and south sides of Utah Lake, and shot all they could find there. During the expedition twenty-seven warriors were killed. The women and children threw themselves upon the settlers for protection and support, and were fed and cared for in Salt Lake City until spring. Thus Utah Valley was entirely rid of hostile Indians. Until 1852 there was no further trouble with them of a serious nature;12 and thus ended the first Indian war of Utah, which like all the others was rather a tame affair. It was the mission of the Mormons to convert the Indians, who were their brethren, and not to kill them.

As was their custom, the women and children of the slain followed the victorious party to their camp.19 In the neighborhood of Pleasant Grove were good farming land, good range for stock, and water-power, inducements which quickly attracted emigrants, and caused the \"place to thrive rapidly. In 1853 the pres ent site was laid out,20 and to this spot were transferred, on July 24th of that year, the effects of the commu nity, then numbering seventy-five families. Between Lehi and Pleasant Grove the village of American Fork was founded in 1850, on a site where were farming and grazing land of fair quality, a little timber, springs of fresh water, and a stream that could be easily diverted for purposes of irrigation.21 About twenty miles south of Provo the settlement of Payson was laid out on the banks of the Peteetneet Creek;22 a few miles to the north-east of Payson was founded a village named Palmyra, containing, at the close of 1 852, fifty families; and in 1851, on Salt Creek, \"Hist.

A fort was afterward built, surrounded by a wall twelve feet in height and six feet at the base.23 Through this town passed the old California or south ern road made by the pioneers in 1849; and here, in cabins built of mud and willows, lived, at the close of 1852, more than forty families.24 I have mentioned that Isaac Morley with two hundred settlers went into the San Pete country in 1848. On the 14th of June, 1849, a council was held at Salt Lake City, at which were present a Ute chief named Walker,25 and twelve of his tribe. After the pipe of peace had been passed around, Walker declared himself a friend of the settlers, and asked their sachem to send a party southward to the valley of San Pete, where they might teach his people how to build and farm. \"Within six moons,\" answered Brigham, \"I will send you a company.\" In the spring of this year the party sent to explore this valley had already selected the site of the present town of Manti, on a branch of the San Pete Creek, though there was little in the neighborhood to invite the settler, sage brush and rabbit brush, the red man and the coyote, being 23 Its length was 420 rods, and its cost $8,400.

In November the town was laid out.26 The name of Manti was suggested by Brigham, who declared that on this spot should be raised one of the cities spoken of in the book of Mor mon, and here he built with his own hands an adobe house, which in 1883 was still pointed out to visitors as one of the curiosities of the place.27 On Chalk Creek, in Pahvan Valley, south-west of Manti and about a hundred and fifty miles from Salt Lake City, a site was chosen by Brigham, in October 1851, for the capital of the territory, and named Fill more, in honor of the president.28 During 1852 the foundations of the state-house were laid, and many private buildings erected, the settlement numbering about seventy families at the close of the year. In the autumn of 1849, John Rowberry, Cyrus Tolman, and others set forth from Salt Lake City to explore the country west of the Jordan Valley, in search of grazing lands whereon to pasture their stock. Crossing the mountain range which forms the western boundary of Cedar and Jordan valleys,29 they discovered a spot where grass, timber, and water were abundant, and encamped for the winter on the banks of a stream now called Emigrant Canon creek.

Tolman suggested Cedar Valley, a large belt of cedar having been found there; but Brigham recommended Tule, as reeds were plentiful in that neighborhood. And so it was ordered; and this word, spelled Tooele by Thomas Bullock, the president's private secretary, is still applied to the town, the site of which was discovered by Rowberry and his comrades.30 In the winter of 1849-50, Edward Phillips and John H. Green proceeded northward from Salt Lake City, intending to settle in the neighborhood of Ogden. When within twelve miles of that place, the snow-drifts prevented further progress, and turn ing aside to Sandy Creek, or as it was later termed, Kay Creek, where the land was covered with bunch grass, they resolved to take up their abode in that neighborhood. After passing the winter in Salt Lake City, the two men set forth in the spring of 1850, ac companied by William Kay and others, and founded the settlement of Kaysville.31 In September it was organized as a ward, Kay being appointed bishop, with Green and Phillips as councillors.32 In the winter of 1849-50, it was ordered by the first presidency that Parley P.

At the Sevier River they met Charles Shumway, James Allred, and Elijah Ward; also Walker, the Utah war chief, and his people, many of whom were sick with the measles. They proceeded to explore the country for some distance round. On the 1st of January, 1850, they were on Virgen River, whence they passed up the Santa Clara, and came to \"the valley subsequently named Mountain Meadows.\" One division of the party explored Little Salt Lake. Beaver Creek was pronounced an excellent place for a settlement. In a half-frozen condition they reached Provo the 30th, and next day some of them were in Salt Lake. The report of Parley being favorable, a party of about one hundred and seventy persons, well sup plied with wagons, implements, live-stock, seeds, and provisions,33 set forth, in charge of George A. Smith, on the 7th of December, 1850, toward the south; and on Centre Creek, in a valley of the Wasatch Range, about two hundred and fifty ruile^ from Salt Lake City, built a fort near the site of the pres ent town of Parowan.34 Pasture and timber were plentiful, the soil was of good quality, and in the sea son of 1851 a bountiful harvest was gathered from about one thousand acres of land.35 The main attrac- tion, however, was the immense deposits of magnetic iron ore found in the neighboring mountains. In May, Brigham and others visited Parowan and ad dressed the people in the fort. The Indian name Parowan was then recommended and adopted.

A few weeks later a small settlement was formed about five miles south of this point, and in 1853 was removed to the present site of Willard City.43 On Red Creek, about twenty miles north of Cedar City, a small settlement was formed in the autumn of 1852, named Paragoonah, the Pi-Ede name for Little' Salt Lake.44 Six miles south of Cedar City, Fort Walk er was built, containing at the close of 1851 only nine men capable of bearing arms; and on Ash Creek, nine teen miles farther south, was Fort Harmony, the southernmost point in the valley occupied by white men,45 and where John D.

Instead of merely adding suburb to suburb, all clustering around the par ent centre, as might have been done by other com munities, the church dignitaries, while yet Salt Lake City was but a village, ordered parties of the brethren, some of them still barely rested from their toilsome journey across the plains, to start afresh for remote and unprotected portions of a then unknown country. As new locations were needed, exploring parties were sent forth, and when a site was selected, a small com pany, usually of volunteers, was placed in charge of an elder and ordered to make ready the proposed settle ment. Care was taken that the various crafts should be represented in due proportion, and that the expe dition should be well supplied with provisions, imple ments, and live-stock. When, for instance, at the close of 1850, it had been resolved to form a settlement in the neighbor hood of Little Salt Lake, a notice appeared in the Deseret News of November 16th, giving the names of those who had joined the party, and calling for a hun dred additional volunteers. They must take with them 30,000 pounds of breadstuffs, 500 bushels of seed wheat, 34 ploughs, 50 horses, 50 beef-cattle, 50 cows, and 25 pairs of holster pistols; each man must be supplied with an axe, spade, shovel, and hoe,46 a gun and 200 rounds was located in 1851 by Robt Watts and nine others.

Among them there should be five carpenters and joiners, a millwright, a surveyor, and two blacksmiths, shoemakers, and masons. Thus equipped and selected, the settlers, with their marvel lous energy and thrift, made more progress and suf fered less privation in reclaiming the waste lands of their wilderness than did the Spaniards in the garden spots of Mexico and Central America, or the English in the most favored regions near the Atlantic sea board. A company was organized in March 1851, at the suggestion of Brigham, to go to California and form the nucleus of a settlement in the Cajon Pass, where they should cultivate the olive, grape, sugar-cane, and cotton, gather around them the saints, and select locations on the line of a proposed mail route.47 The original intention was to have twenty in this company, with Amasa M. Lyman and C. C. Rich in charge. The number, however, reached over five hundred, and Brigham's heart failed him as he met them at start ing. \"I was sick at the sight of so many of the saints running to California, chiefly after the god of this world, and was unable to address them.\"48 47 In Hist.

Its length from east to west was s>50 miles, its breadth 350 miles, and its area 145, 000,000 acres.

For 300 miles along the western base of the Wasatch Range is a narrow strip of alluvial land.1 Elsewhere in the valley the soil is not for the most part fertile until water is conducted to it, and some of the alkali washed out.

Throughout the valley, vegetation is scant except in favored spots. With the exception of the Santa Clara River in the south-west, the Green River in the east, the Grand and other branches of the Colorado in the south and east, the streams all discharge into lakes or are lost in the alkali soil of the bottom-lands. On the hillsides bunch-grass is plentiful the year round, and in winter there is pas ture in the canons. Around Salt Lake the soil is poor ; in the north and east are narrow tracts of fertile land; toward the valleys of the Jordan and Tooele, sepa rated by the Oquirrh Range, and on the banks of the Timpanogos and San Pete, is soil of good quality, that yielded in places from sixty to a hundred bushels of grain to the acre. The Jordan and Timpanogos furnished good water power, and on the banks of the latter stream was built a woollen-mill that ranked as the largest fac tory of the kind west of the Missouri River. In the Green River basin, immense deposits of coal were known to exist, and the Iron Mountains near Little Salt Lake were so called from the abun dance of ore found in their midst. Other valuable minerals were afterward discovered, among them being gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead, sulphur, alum, and borax ; the waters of Great Salt Lake were so densely impreg nated that one measure of salt was obtained from five of brine.2 In the streams were fish of several varieties;3 in ' An analysis of the mineral matter forty years ago showed 97.8 per cent of chloride of sodium, 1.12 of sulphate of lime, .24 of magnesium, and .23 of sulphate of soda.

During the first years that followed their migration, while yet engaged in building houses, fencing lands, planting crops, and tending herds, the Mormons pro vided liberally for the cause of education. In the third general epistle of the twelve, dated the 12th of April, 1850, it is stated that an appropriation of $5,000 per annum, for a period of twenty years, had been made for a state university8 in Salt Lake City, branches to be established elsewhere throughout the territory as they were needed. In the curriculum the Keltic and Teutonic languages were to rank side by side with the Romanic, and all living languages spoken by men were to be included. Astronomy, geology, chemistry, agriculture, engineering, and other branches of science were to be studied; for having sought first the kingdom of heaven, the saints were now assured that knowledge and all other things should be added unto them.7 The world of science was to be revolu- where he will find abundance of the pike, the perch, the bass, and the chub.

The first number, published Feb. 7, 1S49, with Orson Hyde as editor and proprietor, will bear comparison \\\\ ith many of the leading newspapers in eastern or Euro pean cities. In the prospectus Mr Hyde states that 'it will be devoted to the news of the day, to the signs of the times, to religion and prophecy, both an cient and modern; to literature and poetry; to the arts and sciences, together with all and singular whatever the spirit of the timcs.may dictate. ' Published, as was the Guardian, on the extreme frontier of the states, Mr Hyde was enabled to furnish the latest news from Salt Lake City, and many valuable items have been gleaned from its pages. Glancing at them for the first time, one asks, How did he contrive to bring out his newspaper ill such creditable shape, at a place which one year before was only an encampment of emigrants en route for the valley? During this year, however, Kanesville \u2014 later Flor ence \u2014 had made very rapid progress, due, in part, to the migration to Califor nia. Glancing over the first numbers of the Guardian, we find advertised for sale dry goods, groceries, provisions, hardware, clothing, and most of the commodities needed by emigrants. There was a hotel, a fashionable tailor, a lawyer, a doctor, and of course a tabernacle, which served for \u25a0'.ocial parties and religious worship. Provisions rose to very high rates, th' .gh not to the prices demanded in Salt Lake City. On Feb. 7, 1S49, flour, oeef, and pork were selling at Kanesville for about S2 per 100 lbs. On May 1, 1S50, flour was worth \u00a70 to S0.50, beef S3.50 to 84.50, and pork $5 to SO. Potatoes had risen meanwhile from 25 cents to $1, corn from 20 cents to 82.25, and wheat from 50 cents to SI .75, per bushel.

After that date it was suspended for want of paper until Nov. 19th. ' We got short of type, and I happened to have some stereotyped plates, ... which we melted down and used for typ i. We were short, too, of paper, and all went to work to make it. We collectei \\ all the rags we could and made the pulp, sifted it through a sieve, and pressed it as well as we could.' Taylor's Rem., MS., 17. The terms were $5 per year, payable half-yearly in advance, single copies being sold for fifteen cents. There seems to have been some difficulty in collecting subscriptions, for in the issue of November 15, 1851, the editor states that payment will be due at the office on receipt of the first number, 'and no one need expect the second number until these terms are complied with, as credit will not create the paper, ink, press, or hands to labor.' In his prospectus, Richards said that the Deseret News is designed ' to record the passing events of our state, and in connection refer to the arts and sciences, embracing general education, medicine, law, divinity, domestic and political economy, and everything that may fall under our observation which may tend to promote the best interest, welfare, pleasure, and amusement of our fellow-citizens. . .We shall ever take pleasure in communicating foreign news as we have opportunity; in receiving communications from our friends at home and abroad; and solicit ornaments for the News from our poets and poetesses.' In the first issue is the following, perhaps by Beta, who afterward wrote a number of papers styled the Chron icles of Utah in the Salt Lake. City Contributor: To my Friends in the Valley. Let all who would have a good paper, Their talenta and time ne'er abuse; Since 'tis said by the viso and the humored, That the best in the world is the Newa.

And now, dearest friends, I will leaTe you; This counsel, I pray you, don't lose; The best of advice I can give you Is, pay in advance for the News. Fortunately for the prospects and reputation of the paper, such effusions were rare even in its early pages. The Deseret News was at first less ably edited, and inferior, as to type and paper, to the Frontier Guardian. It appears, indeed, to have lacked support, for in the first number are only two adver tisements, one from a blacksmith and the other from a surgeon-dentist, who also professes to cure the scurvy. In Nov. 1S51 it appeared in folio and in greatly improved form; for years it was the only paper, and is still the lead ing Mormon journal, in the territory."], [381, "INDUSTRIES. 327 At Salt Lake City and elsewhere throughout the country manufactures began to thrive. Isolated, poor, having brought little or nothing with them, these set tlers were peculiarly dependent for necessaries and comforts upon themselves, and what they could do with their hands. And it would be difficult to find anywhere in the history of colonization settlers who could do more. Among them were many of the best of Europe's artisans, workers in wood, iron, wool, and cotton, besides farmers, miners, and all kinds of laborers. At Tooele and several other settlements grist mills and saw-mills were established before the close of 1852.15 Near Salt Lake City, a small woollen mill was in operation.18 At Parowan and Cedar City, iron-works were in course of construction; at Paragoonah, a tannery had been built; and at Salt Lake City, in addition to other branches of man ufacture, flannels, linseys, jeans, pottery, and cutlery were produced,17 and sold at lower prices than were asked for eastern goods of inferior quality. \" Produce what you consume,\" writes Governor Brigham Young in his message of January 5, 1852; \"draw from the native elements the necessaries of life; permit no viti ated taste to lead you into indulgence of expensive luxuries which can only be obtained by involving yourselves in debt; let home industry produce every article of home consumption.\"18 This excellent advice \"The first grist-mill built at Tooele was erected by Ezaias Edwards; in 1849 a saw-mill was built at Provo by James Porter and Alex. Williams, and in 1 S50 a grist-mill, by James A. Smith and Isaac Higbee. At American Fork Azra Adams built a grist-mill in 1851; at Manti a grist-mill was built by Brigham Young and Isaac Morley, and a saw-mill by Charles Shumway; in 1848 Samuel Parish built a grist-mill at Centreville.

Such commodities as were not the products of home industry were, for the most part, obtained by barter with passing emigrants, or were brought in wagon trains by way of Kanesville;19 though already traffic had been opened with regions far to the west ward on either side of the Sierra Nevada.20 According to the United States census returns for the year 1850, the population of the valley of Great Salt Lake mustered 11,354 persons, of whom about 53 per cent were males, and 6,000 residents of Salt Lake City.21 There- were 16,333 acres under culti vation, on which were raised 128,711 bushels of grain. The value of live-stock was estimated at $546,698, and of farming implements at $84,288. At the close of 1852, the total population was variously estimated at from 25,000 to 30,000,22 of whom perhaps 10,000 resided in the metropolis.

Little more than five years had elapsed since the pioneer band entered the valley of Great Salt Lake, and now the settlers found themselves amidst plenty and comfort in the land of promise, where until their arrival scarce a human being was to be seen, save the Indians whose clothing was the skins of rabbits and whose' food was roasted crickets.2* There was no destitution in their midst;25 there was little sick ness.28 In these and some other respects, the wildest misstatements have been made by certain gentile writers, among them Mr Ferris, who, as we shall see, was appointed secretary for Utah.27 In this pure show as soon as possible a population of 100,000, which would entitle them to claim admission as a state. 23 Not more than one tenth was collected in cash, payment being usually made in grain.

It was the winter of 1852-3 which he spent there, and while professing that he writes wholly from an anti-Mormon standpoint, as a rule lie is comparatively moderate in his expressions. The illustrations in this volume are many of them the same which are found in several other works. Beginning with the physical features of Utah, he goes through the whole range of Mormon history, and concludes with chapters on government, doc trines, polygamy, book of Mormon proselytizing, aud society.

Here was no rank vegetation, here were no stag nant pools to generate miasma, no vapors redolent of death, like those amid which the saints encamped on the banks of the Missouri. In the valley were mineral springs, the temperature of which ranged from 36\u00b0 to 150\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, some of them being prized for their medicinal properties. From the warm spring28 in the vicinity of Salt Lake City, waters which varied be tween 98\u00b0 in summer and 104\u00b0 in winter29 were con- ducted by pipes to a large bath-house in the north era part of the city.80 28 The water was analyzed in 1851 by L. D. Gale. Its specific gravity was found to be 1.0112; it was strongly impregnated with sulphur, and 100 parts of water yielded 1.082 of solid matter. The specific gravity of the hot spring in the same neighborhood was 1.013, and 100 parts yielded 1.1454 of solid matter. Detailed analyses are given in Stansbury's Expedition to G. S. Lake, i. 419-20. Ananalysisof the warm spring given by Joseph T. Kingsbury in Contributor, iv. 59-00, differs somewhat from that of Gale.

The material for the preceding chapters has been gathered mainly from a number of manuscripts furnished at intervals between 1S80 and 18S5. As I have already stated, to F. D. Richards I am especially indebted for his un remitting effort iu supplying data for this volume. The period between Feb. 1846 and the close of 1851 \u2014 say between the commencement of the exodus from Nauvoo and the opening of the legislature of Utah territory \u2014 is one of which there are few authentic printed records. From Kane's The Mormons, from Fullmer's Expulsion, and other sources, I have gleaned a little; but as far as I am aware, no work has yet been published that gives, or pretends to give, in circumstantial detail the full story of this epoch in the annals of Mor monism. In the Utah Early Records, MS., I have been supplied with a brief but full statement of all the noteworthy incidents from the entrance of Orson Pratt and Erastus Snow into the valley of the Great Salt Lake to the close of the year 1851. In the Narrative of Franklin D. Richards, MS.; the Remi niscences of Mrs F. D. Richards, MS. ; Inner Facts of Social Life in Utah, MS., by the same writer; History of Brigham Young, MS., which is indeed a con tinuation of the History of Joseph Smith, or the history of the church; Mar tin's Narrative, MS.\u2014 I have been kindly furnished with many details that it would have been impossible to obtain elsewhere. Some of them I have al ready noticed, and others I shall mention in their place. In Reminiscences of President John Taylor, MS., we have an account of the migration from Nauvoo to Winter Quarters, the organization of the various"], [385, "MANUSCRIPTS. 331 companies, and much information of a miscellaneous nature, relating to house- building in Salt Lake City, the first manufactures, the location of the temple, and other matters. The manuscript also makes mention of his visit to Eng- land as a missionary in IS46, in company with Parley P. Pratt and Orson Hyde. The Narrative of General Daniel H. Wells, MS., gives an account of the disturbances in Hancock county, the troubles at Nauvoo before the exodus, the journey to Wiuter Quarters, the organization of the Nauvoo legion, and of the state of Deseret; but perhaps the most valuable portion is a condensed narrative of all the Indian outbreaks between 1849 and 1864, a task for which General Wells, who during this period had charge of the Nauvoo legion and aided in suppressing some of the disturbances, is specially qualified. Wilford Woodruffs Journal, MS., commencing with the claims of Sidney Rigdon to the guardianship of the church, in 1846, and closing with a sum- mary of the operations of the pioneers in the following year. Mr Woodruff gives some valuable details concerning this most interesting period in the an- nals of Mormonism. Being himself a pioneer, he furnishes minute particu- lars as to their journey and their early labors in the valley. In A Woman's Experiences with the Pioneer Band, by Mrs Clara Decker Young, MS., we have also some information as to the work accomplished during the single month that the pioneers remained in the valley, among other matters being the building of the old fort. Items of interest are also given concerning those who were left alone in the valley after the pioneers' departure, until the arrival of Parley Pratt's companies. Clara Decker Young, a native of Freedom, N. Y., moved with her parents to Daviess co., Mo., in 1S37, the family being driven, during the persecutions of that year, to Far West, whence they removed to Quincy, and later to Nauvoo. When 16 years of age she became the fifth wife of Brigham Young. From the Material Progress of Utah, by William Jennings, MS., I have gathered many details as to the industrial condition of the Mormons from the earliest settlement of S. L. City up to a recent date, among them being items relating to manufactures, agriculture, stock-raising, the grasshopper plague, and the influence of the railroad on the population of Utah. Early Justice, by John Nebeker, MS., besides describing the punishment of offenders in the days of 1S47, >.ben, as I have already stated, the whipping- post was substituted for imprisonment, furnishes other material of value relating to early times. In his capacity of public complaiuer, Mr Nebeker prosecuted one culprit before the high council for stealing, and himself ad- ministered the slogging. Mr Nebeker, a native of Delaware, came to Nauvoo in the winter of 1S46; crossed the plains with the first companies, and left Winter Quarters with Parley Pratt's detachment. In The Migration and Settlements of the Latter-day Saints, by Mrs Joseph II. Home, MS., is an account of her conversion, her experiences at Far West, Quincy, and Nauvoo, and the hardships suffered during the migration. Then follows a description of the first years in S. L. City, the food, dress, and dwellings of the saints, their make-shifts and privations, with some mention of the Mormon battalion, and the ill feeling caused by the withdrawal of 500 able-bodied men at this crisis in their affairs. Mrs Home, a native of Rain- ham, England, moved with her parents to New York (now Toronto, Canada) when ten years of age. In 1S36, the year of her marriage, she was converted by tho preaching of Parley and Orson Pratt, her house being afterward open to the elders, who frequently held meetings there. From the Utah Sketches, MS., I have gathered much information as to the founding of various settlements and their progress up to the year 1SS0, of which mention will be made later. Most of them were written by persons who were themselves among the earliest settlers, and of whom some are still prominent members of the several communities among which their lot was cast. In this connection may be mentioned the Brief Historical Sketch of the Settlements in Weber County, by Joseph Stanford, MS., and the Historical Sketch of Ogden City, by the same author.

We are now prepared to ask the question with some degree of intelligence, What is Mormonism? In for mulating an answer, we must consider as well the political as the religious idea. I will examine the latter first. Mormonism in its religious aspect is simply the ac ceptation of the bible, the whole of it, literally, and following it to its logical conclusions. As the Christian world has advanced in civilization and intelligence these two thousand years or so, it has gradually left behind a little and a little more of its religion, first of the tenets of the Hebraic record, and then somewhat even of those of the later dispensation. Long before religionists began to question as myths the stories of Moses, and Jonah, and Job, they had thrown aside as unseemly blood-sacrifice and burnt offerings, sins of uncleanness, the stoning of sabbath breakers, the killing in war of women, children, and prisoners, the condemnation of whole nations to per petual bondage, and many other revolting customs of the half-savage Israelites sanctioned by holy writ.

Then came the putting away of slavery and polygamy, the former but recently permitted in these American states, and the latter being here even now. Among the discarded customs taught and en couraged by the new testament are, speaking in tongues, going forth to preach without purse or scrip, laying on of hands for the healing of the sick, rais ing the dead, casting out devils, and all other miracles; and there will be further repudiations as time passes, further ignoring of portions of the scriptures by ortho dox sects, a further weeding out of the unnatural and irrational from things spiritual and worshipful. The tenets of the Mormon church are these : The bible is the inspired record of God's dealings with men in the eastern hemisphere; the book of Mormon is the inspired record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of this continent; the book of Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints consists of revelations from God concerning the present dispensation to Joseph Smith, who was inspired to translate the book of Mormon and organize the church of Christ anew. Joseph Smith to the present dispensation is as Moses was to Israel; there is no conflict, either in per sonages or books. The statements, assertions, prom ises, and prophecies of the books, and the precepts and practices of the personages, are accepted, all of them, and held to be the revealed will to man of one and the same God, whose will it is the duty and en deavor of his people to carry out in every particular to the best of their ability. There are more gods than one. There are spirit ual gifts. Not only must there be faith in Christ, but faith in the holy priesthood, and faith in continual"], [389, "CHURCH DOCTRINE. 335 revelation.1 Man is a free agent. The laying on of hands for ordination, and for the healing of the sick, descends from the early to the later apostles.2 There will be a resurrection of the body and a second coming of Christ. Israel is a chosen people; there has been a scattering of Israel, and there will be a gathering. Joseph Smith was the fulfiller not only of bible proph ecies, but of the book of Mormon prophecies, and of his own prophecies. Foreordination, election, and dispensation of the fulness of times are held. There was an apostasy of the primitive church, and now there is a return. There was the Jerusalem of the eastern hemisphere; on the continent of North Amer ica is planted the new Jerusalem. Miracles obtain; also visions and dreams, signs and tokens, and angels of light and darkness. There are free spirits and spirits imprisoned; the wicked will be destroyed, and there will be a millennial reign. The saints are largely of the house of Israel, and heirs to the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

The author was a native of New York, and born in 1794. He was a firm be liever in latter-day revelations from God, and that the ancient gifts of the gospel still remained, long before he joined the Mormons. He labored long and in various places. He held property in Nauvoo when the saints were driven out, and was obliged to take $250 for what was worth \u00a73,000. After ward he underwent all the sufferings and vicissitudes of the overland journey to Salt Lake. Mr Brown was an earnest and honest man; his book is the record of his life, and is simple and attractive in style and substance. 2 Healing the sick. Joseph early laid it down as a rule that all diseases and sickness among them were to be cured by the elders, and by the use of herbs alone. Physicians of the world were denounced as enemies to mankind, and the use of iheii medicines was prohibited. Afterw H, anointing with oil, prayer, and laying on hands were resorted to in addi 'on to the lirst men tioned. Says Mrs Richards, ' In all sicknesses we useu no medicines, with the exception of herb teas that we ourselves prepared, trusting exclusively to the efficacy of the anointing with oil and prayer.' Reminiscences, MS., 34. Joseph said, 'All wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man. Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof.' The use of flesh was not forbidden, but rather re stricted to seasons of cold and famine. All grain was pronounced good for man, but wheat was particularly recommended, with corn for the ox, oats for the horse, rye for fowls and swine, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks; as also other grain.

We believe, say their articles of faith, in God the father, in Jesus Christ the son, and in the holy ghost. For their own sins, and not for any transgression of Adam, men will be punished; but all may be saved, through the atonement, by obedience to the ordi nances of the gospel, which are: faith in Christ, re pentance, baptism by immersion,8 and laying on of ' Baptism, a prerequisite to church membership, as well as to final salva tion, to be of avail, must be by immersion, and performed by one of the sect.

Amen.' Doctrine and Covenants, 115, US. Baptisms are entered in the gen eral church records, giving the name, place, and date of birth, quorum, date of baptism, first time or re-baptism, by whom baptized, when and by whom confirmed. Deseret'News, Feb. 22, 1851. In 1844, complaints were made that members of the church, dismissed by the council, had been re-baptized by elders who were themselves excluded, and declaring such baptisms invalid. Times ami Seasons, v. 458-9. In 1836, Joseph introduced the ceremony of anointing with consecrated oil. He first anointed his father, who, having been blessed by the first presidency, anointed them in turn, beginning with the eldest. The bishops of Kirtland and Zion, together with their counsellors, were next anointed, and after ward the presiding officers of each quorum performed the ceremony on their subordinates, assisted in some instances by the Smith brothers. Joseph de scribes the ceremony of consecrating the oil, as follows: ' I took the oil in my left hand, Father Smith being seated before me, and the remainder of the presidency encircled him round about. We then stretched our right hands towards heaven, and blessed the oil, and consecrated it in the name of Jesus Christ.' Mil. Star, xv. 620. Olive-oil is commonly used. Mrs Richards, Reminiscences, MS., 34. Many remarkable cures are mentioned. A sea man, belonging to H. B. M. ship Terror, was rendered deaf and dumb by a stroke of lightning, at Bermuda. Several years after, he was baptized by elders in a canal in England, and instantly recovered both speech and hearing. Frontier Guardian, Jan. 23, 1850. In 1840, a young woman then living at Batavia, N. Y., who had been deaf and dumb for four and one half years, was first restored to her hearing by the laying on of the hands of the elders of the church, and a second ministration, some time afterward, enabled her to speak. Times and Seasons, ii. 516^-17. During the building of Nam\"- , nearly every one was attacked with malarial fever, caused by breaking ,.p the new land, and even the prophet himself suc cumbed for a time. But hearing the voice of the Lord calling on him, he arose and went through the camp healing all to whom he drew near. Woodruff {Mrs), Autobiog., 2-3. Brigham declares he was among the num ber healed at this time. Mil. Star, xxv. 646. While Joseph was in the midst of his sick, an unbeliever, living a few miles distant, came to him, beseeching him to come and heal his twin children, who were near death's door. The prophet was unable to go himself, but sent Wilford Woodruff in his place. Says the latter, ' He [Joseph] took a red silk handkerchief out of his pocket and gave it to me, and told me to wipe their faces with the handkerchief"], [391, "THE MORMON CREED. 337 hands for the gift of the holy ghost. We believe in the same organization and powers that existed in when I administered to them, and they should be healed.

Leaves from my Journal, 65. F. D. Richards, who had been sick for several months, was baptized, anointed, and confirmed; immediately after which he was restored to health. Some time afterward, being then an elder, he cured a severe toothache by touching the tooth with his finger. Narrative, MS., 15-16. Mrs Richards' brother, afterward Elder Snyder, was raised from a sick-bed after having been baptized and adminis tered to by Elder John E. Page. Mrs Richards was taken by her brother from a sick-bed to a lake from the surface of which ice more than a foot thick had been removed, and there baptized, whereupon she immediately recovered. Similar cases might be given by the score. Baptism for the dead is first alluded to by the prophet, who, in a revela tion dated Jan. 19, 1S41, declares, 'A baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they, my saints, may be baptized for those who are dead.' It is intimated that a reasonable time will be allowed in which to build a temple aud a permanent font, and that during this time a temporary substitute for the font may be employed; but after the completion of the temple, no baptisms for the dead will be of avail unless conducted within the build ing. See Doctrine and Covenants, 392, 395. Brigham says he first heard of the new doctrine when he was in Europe (1840), and that he believed in it before anything was said or done about it in the church. Times and Seasons, vi. 954. Daniel Tyler says the doctrine wa3 first taught in Nauvoo, although Joseph told some of the elders in Kirtland that it was part of the gospel, and would yet be practised as such. Juvenile Instructor, xv. 56. He also says that before other provision was made, many were baptized in the Mississippi River. The first baptismal font, a temporary structure, intended for use ouly until the completion of the temple, was erected in the basement of that build ing, and dedicated on Nov. 8, 1841, Joseph being present and Brigham deliv ering the address. Joseph thus describes the font: It is constructed of pine staves, tongued and grooved, and is oval-shaped, 'sixteen feet long east and west, aud twelve feet wide, seven feet high from the foundation, the basin four feet deep; the mouldings of the cap and base are formed of beautiful carved work in antique style. The sides are finished with panel-work. A flight of stairs in the north and south sides lead up and down into the basin, guarded by a side railing. The font stands upon twelve oxen, four on each side and two at each end, their heads, shoulders, and fore legs project ing out from under the font; they are carved out of oak plank, glued together and copied after the most beautiful five-year-old steer that could be found in the country, and they are an excellent striking likeness of the original; the horns were geometrically formed after the most perfect horn that could be procured. The oxen and the mouldings were carved by Elder Elijah Ford ham, from the city of New York, the work occupying eight months. The whole was enclosed in a temporary frame building. ' Mil. Star, xviii. 744. On Sept. 6, 1842, Joseph wiitcs to the church that all baptisms must be re corded by a person appointed for the purpose, and whose duty it will be to note every detail of the ceremony in each case. One of the officials is to be appointed in each ward, and his returns properly certified to are to be forwarded to the general recorder, who will enter them on the church records, together with the names of all witnesses, etc., and finally add his own certifi cate as to the genuineness of the signature of the ward recorder. This detail is necessary for the proper identification hereafter of those baptized, for the authority for which the prophet quotes Revelations, xx. 12. 'And I saw the Hibt.

Mil. Star, xx. 5-6; Doctrine and Covenants, 409- 13. For the ceremony itself, he finds warrant in 1st Cor., xv. 29. 'Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead ? If the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for the dead?' Confirmation follows baptism, with frequently an interval of a few days. B;iptism may take place on any day in the week, and the confirmation be de- ferred until tho church assembles on the following, or even a later, Sunday. Two or more elders commonly attend, all taking part in the ceremony. Mrs Stenhouse thus describes her own confirmation: 'Four elders placed their hands solemnly upon my head, and one of them said: \"Fanny, by virtue of the authority vested in me, I confirm you a member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints; and inasmuch as you have been obedient to the command of God, through his servants, and have been baptized for the re- mission of your sins, I say unto you that those sins aro remitted. And in the name of God I bless you, and say unto you, that inasmuch as you aro faithful and obedient to the teachings of the priesthood, and seek the advancement of the kingdom, there is no good thing that your heart can desire that the Lord will not give unto you. You shall have visions and dreams, and angel3 shall visit you by day and by night. You shall stand in the temple i:i Zion, and administer to the saints of the most high God. You shall speak in tongues aud prophecy; and the Lord shall bless you abundantly, both tempo- rally and spiritually. These blessings I seal upon your head, inasmuch as you shall be faithful; and I pray heaven to bless you; and say unto you, be thou blessed, in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy ghost. Amen.'\" Englishwoman in Utah, 19-20. 4 The gift of tongues is the power to speak in a strange language, but not to translate. It first appeared about 1S30, when it was pronounced of the devil. Howe says it was revived in the early part of 1S33, and that at one meeting Joseph passed around the room laying his hand upon each one, and speaking as follows: 'Ak man, oh son, oh man, ah ne commene en holle goste en haben en glai hosanne en holle goste en esac milkea Jeremiah, cze- kicl, Nephi, Lehi, St John,' etc. lVormonism Unveiled, 132-0. In this year, it was suggested that 'no prophecy spoken in tongues should be made public, for this reason: many who pretend to have the gift of interpretation are liable to be mistaken, and do not give the true interpretation of what is spoken;. . . but if any speak in tongues a word of exhortation or doctrine, or the princi- ples of the gospel, etc., let it be interpreted for the edification of the church.' limes and Seasons, vi. 805. The gift was not confined to men; many women were notc.l for eloquence when thus inspired. Says Mrs Stenhouse of a Sister Ellis: Her hands were clenched, and her eyes had that wild and supernatural glare which is never seen save in cases of lunacy or intense feverish excite- ment. Every one waited breathlessly, listening to catch what she might say; you might have heard a pin drop. They [her utterances] seemed to mo chief- ly the repetition of the same syllables, something like a child repeating la, la, la, le, lo; ma, ma, ma, mi, ma; dele, dele, dele, hela; followed, perhaps, by a number of sounds strung together, which could not be rendered in any shape by the pen.' Englishwoman in Utah, 27-8. Says Orson Hyde: 'We believe in the gift of the holy ghost being enjoyed now as much as it was in the apostles days, and that it is imparted by tho laying on of hands of those in authority; and that the gift of tongues, and also the gift of prophecy, au-e gifts of the spirit, and are obtained through that medium.' Frontier (Juardian, Dec. 12, 1S49. Mrs Stenhouse remarks that 'in later days, the exer cise of this gift has been discouraged by the elders, and especially by Brigham.'

In the scriptures is found the law of tithing, which law is now revived, and the keeping of it made one of the first duties of the saints. The ten commandments, and all other commandments, ordinances, promulgations, and possi bilities, are in* force now as at the time they were given. Marriage is a sacred and an eternal covenant. Plural marriage, sanctioned under the old dispensa tion and revived under the new, is open to all, and is, in some instances, commanded, when it becomes a sacred obligation. Seldom does a good Mormon appear in a court of law arrayed against a brother Mormon. And this is why, as the saints allege, the twenty-five or fifty law yers in Utah who are compelled to derive their living almost entirely from the gentiles, are so bitter against the saints. When two Mormons disagree, they pre sent themselves before the president of the stake, who with twelve councillors, six facing six, their selection having been agreed to by the litigants, is ready to try the case without delay. Plaintiff and defendant, each with his witnesses, take their places before the pres ident, and between the rows of councillors. Prayer is then offered, almighty aid being asked in bringing the affair to a righteous and amicable conclusion. The litigants state the case, each from his own stand point; .the witnesses are heard; the councillors de cide. Prayer is again offered. The adversaries shake hands; there is nothing to pay. Until the gentiles came, there were in Utah no police or police courts; no houses of drinking, or of gambling, or of prostitu tion.

The doctrine of blood atonement was early inculcated by the church, as a sacrifice necessary for salvation, and not, as many have asserted, in order to legalize murder. There were the altars and the offerings of the old testament, and the great god-man sacrifice of the new. Christ made the atonement for the sins of the world by the shedding of his blood. By the laws of the land, he who commits murder must atone for it by his own death.6 There are sins of various de- 6 The theory of blood atonement is that for certain sins the blood of the transgressor must be shed to save his soul. Among these sins are apostasy, the shedding of innocent blood, and unfaithfulness to marriage obligations on the part of the wife. Says Brigham, in a discourse delivered in Salt Lake City: 'There are sins which men commit for which they cannot receive for giveness in this world, or in that which is to come, and if they had their eyes open to their true condition, they would be perfectly willing to have their blood spilled upon the ground, that the smoke thereof might ascend to heaven as an offering for their sins; and the smoking incense would atone for their sins; whereas, if such is not the case, they will stick to them and re main upon them in the spirit world. I know, when you hear my brethren telling about cutting people off from the earth, that you consider it is strong doctrine; but it is to save them, not to destroy them. . .1 do know that there are sins committed, of such a nature that if the people did understand the doctrine of salvation they would tremble because of their situation. And furthermore, I know that there are transgressors who, if they knew them selves and the only condition upon which they can obtain forgiveness, would beg of their brethren to shed their blood, that the smoke thereof might as cend to God as an offering to appease the wrath that is kindled against them, and that the law might have its course. I will say further: I have had men come to me ami offer their lives to atone for their sins. . .There are sins that can be atoned for by an offering upon an altar, as in ancient days; and there are sins that the blood of a lamb, of a calf, or of turtle-doves cannot remit, but they must bo atoned for by the blood of the man.' And at another time: 'All mankind love themselves, and let these principles be known by an individual, and he would be glad to have his blood shed. That would be loving themselves, even unto an eternal exaltation. Will you love your brothers or sisters likewise when they have committed a sin that can not be atoned for without the shedding of their blood? Will you love that man or woman well enough to shed their blood ? That is what Jesus Christ meant... I could refer you to plenty of instances where men have been righteously slain in order to atone for their sins. I have seen scores and hundreds of people for whom there would have been a chance in the last resurrection if their lives had been taken and their blood spilled on the ground as a smoking incense to the almighty. . .1 have known a great many men who have left this church for whom there is no chance whatever for exaltation; but if their blood had been spilled it would have been better for them. This is loving our neighbor as ourselves; if he needs help, help him; and if he wants salvation, and it is necessary to spill his blood on the earth in order that he may be saved, spill it.' Deseret News, Oct. 1, 1856, Feb 18, 1S57. Following Brigham's lead, Heber C. Kimball and Jedediah M. Orant taught the same doctrine during the religious revival, or so-called reformation, in Utah, in 1S56-7, of which more later, Grant being the most vehement of the three. The reader will find these discourses reported at length in the Deseret News. The doctrine is very clearly explained in Pen-"], [395, "ORDERS OF PRIESTHOOD. 341 grees of heinousness; some requiring only public con fession and promised reformation by way of atone ment, whilst others are characterized by an enormity so vast that pardon on earth is impossible. Of the first class are all minor offences against church disci pline, breach of which has been publicly acknowledged by nearly every leader, from Joseph himself down to the humblest official. For the proper carrying out of the instructions re vealed in the sacred books, an organization has been effected in these latter days, based upon books and on former organizations. There are two principal priesthoods, the Melchisedek and the Aaronic, the latter including the Levitical. The Melchisedek is the higher, comprising apostles, patriarchs, high-priests, seventies, and elders. It holds the right of presi dency, with authority to administer in all the offices, ordinances, and affairs of the church. It holds the keys of all spiritual blessings, receives the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, whose doors are ever open, and holds communion with God the father, Jesus Christ the mediator, Joseph Smith the prophet, and all departed saints.6 \u2022 The Aaronic is a subordinate priesthood, being an appendage to the Melchisedek, and acting under its rose's Blood Atonement, passim. See also Lee's Morm., 282-3; Morm. Proph., 157-60; Young's Wife No. 19, 182-99; Paddock's La Tour, 305-8; Bertrand's Mem. Morm., 139-72, 250-8, 290-316. 6 In regard to the two priesthoods, the Melchisedek and the Aaronic, or Levitical, all authority in the church is subordinate to the first, which holds the right of presidency and has power over all the offices in the church. The presidency of the high-priesthood of this order has the right to officiate in all the offices of the church. High-priests are authorized to officiate in any lower positions in the church, as well as in their own office. Elders are of this priesthood, and are authorized to officiate instead of high-priests, in the absence of the latter. The twelve apostles are charged with the duty of or daining all the subordinate officers of the church, and also with its missionary work. Together they form a quorum whose authority equals that of the first presidency, but action by either body must be unanimous. A majority may form a quorum when circumstances render it impossible to assemble the whole body. They also constitute a travelling, presiding high-council, under the direction of the presidency of the church, aud it is their duty to ordain ministers in all large branches.

It comprises bishops, priests, teachers, and deacons, who hold the keys of the ministering angels, having power to administer in certain ordi nances and in the temporal affairs of the church, bap tizing and sitting as judges in Israel. The bishopric is the presidency of the Aaronic priesthood. The office of a bishop is to administer in temporal matters. First-born sons, lineal descendants of Aaron, and no others, have a legal right to the bishopric. But a high-priest of the order of Melchisedek may officiate in all lesser offices, including that of bishop, when no lineal descendant of Aaron can be found, and after he has been ordained to this power by the first presidency. There is also the patriarchal priesthood,7 ' About 1834, Joseph Smith had a revelation to the effect that it was the will of the Lord that every father should bless his -own children, and that patriarchs should be set apart to bless those without a father in the church. This revelation was due to an expressed desire on the part of Brigham Young's father to bless his own children before dying, after the manner of the patri- archs of old. Young's Wife No. 19, 581. Several years before this, it had been directed that every member of the church having children should bring them to the elders before the church, who were to lay their hands upon them in the name of Jesus Christ, and bless them. Doctrine and Covenants, 72. During the life of the first patriarch \u2014 Jos. Smith, sen. \u2014 these blessings were nominally free to the recipients. A high-council held at Kirtland in Sept. 1835 decided that when tho patriarch was occupied in blessing the church, he should be paid at the rate of ten dollars a week, and his expenses; also that Frederick G. Williams be appointed to attend blessing meetings, and record the proceedings, for which services he should receive the same com- pensation. The payment of twelve dollars for a book in which to record the blessings caused discussion in this couned, and brother Henry Green, who had intimated that a suitable book could be procured for less money, was ex- cluded from the church for his presumption. Mil. Star, xv. 308-9. Iu Jan. 1830, Smith, sen., was anointed with oil by the prophet, blessed by each of the presidency in turn, and was thenceforth known as Father Smith. Id. , 020. In 1S37, the pay of the patriarch was fixed at a dollar and fifty cents a day, and that of the recorder at ten cents for each 100 words. Mil. Star, xvi. 109. When Hyrum became patriarch, says the author of Young's Wife No. 19, 5S1, the demand for blessings had so increased that one dollar each was charged for them; and ia 1S75 the price had advanced to two dollars. Upon the death of his father in 1840, Hyrum Smith succeeded to the office of patriarch, pursuant to a revelation entailing it on tho eldest son. The revelation is dated in Jan. 1S41. Doctrine and Covenants, 305-0; Mil. Star, xviii. 3G3. The fol- lowing notice appears iu Times and Seasons, Nov. 1, 1S41: 'The brethren are hereby notified that our well-beloved brother, Hyrum Smith, patriarch of the church, has erected a comfortable office opposite his dwelling-house [in Nauvoo], where himself, together with his scribe and recorder, James Sloan, wi.l attend regularly every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, during the entire day, or upon any other day if urgent circumstances require it, to per form the duties of his high and holy calling. A copy of the blessings can be received immediately after being pronounced, so that the brethren who live"], [397, "THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH. 343 the patriarch to be the oldest man of the blood of Joseph or of the seed of Abraham. Likewise there are mothers in Israel.8 Head over all is the First Presidency of the Church, known also as the First Presidency of the High^Priest hood, and consisting of a president and two council lors.9 The first presidency presides over and governs at a distance can have it to take with them.' Hyrum's successor was his brother William, who was disfellowshipped in 1845, John Smith, brother to the prophet, being ordained patriarch over the church, and holding that office until his death in 1S54. In the following year Hyrum's son John was ordained patriarch, and since that date has been sustained iu his office at each successive conference. A child is first blessed when eight days old, aud again so soon as the mother is able to present her child on a regular fast-day. 1 he first Thursday in each month is set apart lor fasting. Mrs Richards' Rem iniscences, MS., 34-5. The second ceremony is usually attended by both parents, and in addition to a blessing, the child receives its name. Each birthday it is customary for the parents to hold a family gathering, when the child is again blessed, and prayers offered for its welfare. When eight years old, the child is baptized. See Home's Migrations, MS., 37. The blessings are not only pronounced, but also written out. Id. , 34. ' These blessings are rather wonderful affairs; they promise all sorts of things, in a vague, in definite way, if only the recipient proves faithful. Some are assured they shall never taste death, but live until Christ comes, and be caught up to meet him in the air; others are assured that they are to have the privilege of re deeming their dead so far back that there shall not be a broken link in the chain. Absurd as this all seems, there are hundred of saints who believe that every word shall be fulfilled.' Young's Wife No. 19, 5S1. 8 Hall says there is a class of women, mothers in Israel, whose business it is to instruct females as to their duty in matters not suitable to be taught from the stand. Mormonism Exposed, 39-44. 8 Early in 1S33 the first presidency was established, with Joseph Smith at the heatl, his associates in tho management of affairs being Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams. The revelation creating this triumvirate is dated March 8th, and in it Joseph's coadjutors arc instructed first to finish the translation of the prophets, and afterward preside over the affairs of the church and the school. Times and Seasons, v. 73G-7. William Hall, who was a member of the church for seven years, erroneously states that the presidency at first consisted of Smith, Rigdon. aud William Law. Abominations, 8. At a conference held-in Sept. 1S37, Joseph appealed to the church to ascertain if he was still regarded as its head, when the vote was unanimous. Ho then introduced Rigdon and Williams as his councillors. According to the min utes of the conference, Williams was not accepted at first, but this action appears to have been rescinded afterward. Mil. Star, xvi. 50. Oliver Cow dery, Jos. Smith, sen., Hyrum Smith, and John Smith were accepted as assist ant councillors, and these seven were henceforth to be regarded the heads of the church. At a general conference of the branch of the church at Far West in Nov. 1837, the action of the Kirtland conference was sustained so far as Smith aud Rigdon were concerned, but Williams was rejected. Hyrum Smith was unanimously chosen in Williams' place. Mil. Star, xvi. 106-7. At a conference held at Far West in April 1S3S, the first presidency was ap pointed to sign the licenses of the official members of the church. In Jan. 1841, Joseph had a revelation to the effect that he was presiding elder over all the church, translator, revelator, a seer, and prophet; and .hat his coun cillors were Sidney Rigdon and William Law. These three were to consti-"], [398, "MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. 344 all the affairs of the church, temporal and spiritual; the first president is the prophet of God, seer, reve lator, and translator.

Law's selection was to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Hyrum Smith to be patriarch. Mil. Star, xviii. 363. In this same month Joseph notified the recorder of Hancock county that he (Joseph) had been elected sole trustee of the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints by the church at Nauvoo, to hold office during life. Id., 373. Smith, Rigdon, and Law were continued in office by the annual conference, convened in April 1843. After the murder of the Smiths in 1844, the first presidency lapsed, and for more than three years the church was governed by the quorum of the twelve apostles, of which Brigham was president. At a meeting of the twelve apos- tles, high-council, and high-priests at Nauvoo, in August 1844, Sidney Rigdon offered himself as guardian to the church, claiming that his action was in obedience to revelation. Young opposed Rigdon's claims, and the assembly decided that the twelve should govern the church, with Young at their head. Mil. Star, xxv. 215-17, 263-4. In Dec. 1847 Brigham Young, Heber C. Kim- ball, and Willard Richards were chosen to constitute the first presidency. Juv. Inst., xiv. 128. Young died in 1877, and the presidency remained vacant until October 1880, when John Taylor was chosen, with George Q. Can- non and Joseph F. Smith as councillors. Marshall, Through America, 161. This conference lasted five days. S. L. Tribune, Oct. 11, 1880. On the death of the president the quorum is dissolved, and its members, as a presidency, have no status. Richards' Narr., MS., 51. 10 On Feb. 14, 1835, the church at Kirtland met for the purpose of choos- ing and ordaining the twelve apostles. The business occupied several days. Briefly, the ceremonies were as follows: The assemblage consented to accept the names presented by the three witnesses who had been appointed to make the selection. P. P. Pratt says, in his Autobiog., 127-28, the ceremonies were performed by Smith, Whitmer, and Cowdery, and that they acted in accord- ance with the revelation of June 1829; but in the history of Jos. Smith, Mil. Star, Mar. and Apr. 1 853, the three witnesses only are mentioned. Martin Harris' name dogs not appear in the revelation referred to. See Doctrine and Covenants, 190-2. In an article by 'R. A.' in the Juv. Inst., xiv. 128, the selection is accredited to the three witnesses, who are mentioned by name. As Pratt was one of the ordained, it would seem that his account should be reliable. Each candidate came forward as summoned, and in re- turn received a blessing, and a charge from one of the three. The order of ordination was as follows: On Feb. 14th, Lyman E. JohnsoD, Brigham Youug, and Heber C. Kimball. On the next day, Orson Hyde, David W. Patten, Luke Johnson, Wm E. McLellin, John F. Boynton, and William Smith. On Feb. 21st, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, and Thos B. Marsh, who were absent on a mission, were ordained upon their return to Kirtland, which occurred later. Mil. Star, xv. 206-12. Shortly after, the names were arranged according to seniority, when they stood, Marsh, Patten, Young, Kimball, Hyde, McLellin, P. P. Pratt, Luke Johnson, Smith, O. Pratt, Boynton, and L. E. Johnson. Four of the above apostatized in 1838, viz.: McLellin, the Johnsons, and Boynton; John Taylor, John E. Page, Wilford Woodruff, and Willard Richards were appointed instead. Shortly after this, Marsh, the"], [399, "THE APOSTOLATE. 345 first instance by reason of seniority or ordination, usually becomes president of the church. The office of the twelve is to preach and teach throughout the world, regulating the affairs of the church every where under the direction of the first presidency, calling to their aid therein the seventies. An apostle may administer in the several offices of the church, particularly in spiritual matters.11 The office of a patriarch is to give patriarchal blessings; the office of a member of a seventy is to travel and preach the gospel; but a patriarch, a high-priest, a president of the twelve, apostatized, and in 1838 Patten was killed, which left Young at the head of the list, and he became president of the twelve. Geo. A. Smith was ordained in 1839, and Lyman Wight not long after. In 1844, according to Elder Phelps, the following names were on the roll: Young, Kimball, Parley P. Pratt, Hyde, Richards, Taylor, William Smith, Woodruff, George A. Smith, Orson Pratt, Page, and Wight. During this year Wm Smith and Page apostatized, and were replaced by Amasa M. Lyman and Ezra T. Benson. Early in 1845, Young, Kimball, and Rich- ards were chosen to the first presidency, and Wight was disfellowshipped for apostasy ; the vacancies thus caused were filled by appointing Chas C. Rich, Lorenzo and Erastus Snow, and Franklin D. Richards. In 1857, Geo. Q. Cannon was appointed, vice P. P. Pratt, deceased. In 1867, Lyman was dropped and Jos. F. Smith appointed. In 1868, Geo. A. Smith became one of the first presidency, and Brigham Young, jun., succeeded him. Albert Carrington was appointed in 1809 in place of Benson, deceased, and Moses Thatcher in 1879, vice Hyde, deceased in 1878; which left the twelve in the follow ing order: John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Orson Pratt, Chas C. Rich, Lorenzo Snow, Erastus Snow, Franklin D. Richards, George Q. Cannon, Brigham Young, Joseph F. Smith, Albert Carrington, Moses Thatcher, Pratt being the only remaining member of the original twelve. Juv. Inst., xiv. 128-9. The vacancies caused by the elevation of John Taylor to the presi- dency in 1880, with George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith as councillors, were partially filled by the appointment of Francis M. Lyman and John H. Smith. S. L. Tribune, Oct. 11, 1880. Orson Pratt died Oct. 1881, and a year later Geo. Teasdale and Heber J. Grant were elected. Hand-book of Res., 89-90. Up to 1877, the twelve received no pay for their services; but the con- ference of Oct. voted $1,500 a year to each apostle. ' This is the first sum that has ever been publicly appropriated to any council of the church for the performance of their duties to the people. When I went to Europe in 1806, I borrowed the means and gave my note; on my return I had to pay back my indebtedness.'

All superior officers are frequently called elders. Thus an apostle is an elder; and he may baptize, and ordain other elders, priests, teachers, and deacons. It is his calling to administer bread and wine, or bread and water, emblems of the flesh and blood of Christ; to confirm the baptized by the laying on of hands for the baptism of fire and the holy ghost; to teach, ex pound, exhort, and to lead in meetings as he is led by the holy ghost. A bishop who is a first-born and a lineal descend ant of Aaron may sit as a common judge in the church without councillors, except in the trial of a president of the high-priesthood. But a bishop from the high priesthood may not sit as a judge without his two councillors. Over all the bishops in the church there is a presiding bishop. The duties of a priest are to preach, baptize, ad minister the sacrament, and visit families and pray with them. The duties of a teacher are to watch over and strengthen the church, and see that no iniquity creeps into it, and that every member performs his obligations and conducts himself without guile. The duties of the deacon are to assist the teacher and the bishop, attending to the temporal affairs of the church, looking after the houses of worship and the necessities of the poor. Teachers and deacons may instruct and exhort, but they are not authorized to baptize, lay on hands, or administer the sacrament. No one can hold office except by authoritative call and ordination, or by special appointment of God. The seventies are organized into various councils of seventy, commonly called quorums. Each council of seventy has seven presidents, chosen out of the seven ty, one of the seven presiding over the others and over the whole seventy. The seven presidents of the first council of seventies also preside over all the councils"], [401, "COUNCILS. 347 of seventies.12 According to Elder John Jaques, to whose little book on the priesthood I am indebted for this information, there were in 1882 seventy -six coun cils of seventies, with seventy members in each council when complete. Elders are organized in councils of ninety-six, each council having a president and two councillors. Priests are organized in councils of forty-eight, each with a president \u2014 who must be a bishop \u2014 and two councillors. Teachers are organized in councils of twenty-four, and deacons in councils of twelve, each with a president and two councillors.13 In the society of saints, there are territorial divi sions into what are called Stakes of Zion. In Utah, these divisions correspond usually, but not necessa rily, with the counties, each county being a stake. laIn February 1835, Joseph Smith, with the aid of the recently appointed apostles, proceeded to organize two quorums of the seventies, whose duties were to assist in the missionary work of the church. Each quorum had seven presidents, and these constituted the councils of the two organizations. Jo- seph Youngsen, who gives au account of the seventies, gives the names of the presidents of the first quorum only, as follows: Hazen Aldrich, Joseph Young, Levi W. Hancock, Leonard Rich, Zebedee Coltrin, Lyman Sherman, and Sylvester Smith. After noting the chauges in the interval, he states that in 1S78 the presidents were Youug, sen., Hancock, Henry Herriman, Albert P. Rockwood, Horace S. Eldredge, Jacob Gates, and John Van Cott.

The presi dent of a stake, with his two councillors, presides over the high-council of that stake, which has original and appellate jurisdiction, and whose decisions are usually, but not invariably, final. Appeals are had to a gen eral assembly of the several councils of the priesthood, but such appeals are seldom taken. The jurisdiction of the several councils is ecclesiastical, affecting fellow ship and standing only, the extreme penalty being excommunication. Each stake is divided into wards, the number being according to territory and population; over each ward presides a bishop, with his two councillors. Each stake and each ward, as a rule, has its own meeting house. There are about twenty -five stakes, divided into some three hundred wards. Salt Lake City is divided into twenty-one wards, each containing for the most part nine ten-acre blocks, though in the out skirts they are larger. Each stake holds a quarterly conference; and the church holds a general conference every April and October.

And as the book of Mormon is held to be a continuation of the historical portion of the bible, and equally with it the word of God; and as the ideas and instructions con tained in the book of Doctrine and Covenants have been derived, for the most part, from a study and lit eral interpretation of the bible \u2014 though with some thing added \u2014 it is safe to say that in the main the Mormons believe what the bible teaches, and that Mormonism is the acceptation of the bible, the whole of it, literally, and following it to its logical conclu sions.

The first was received in Feb., the second in May, and the last in Aug. See Times and Seasons, iv. 309; v. 416, 466. But it was not until several years later that an organized system was established, by revelation dated Far West, Jn.y 8, 1838. See Doctrine and Covenants, 382-3. During the progress of settlements at Far West, the ques tion of taxation was brought up aud referred to the prophet, who inquired of the Lord, and received answer that all surplus property must be turned over to the bishop as the first step, after which one tenth of each annual interest was also to be paid. These payments were to be devoted to the building of a place of worship, and for the debts of the presidency. In the Millennial Star, xxv. 474, it is denied that the priesthood receive any support from the tithing fund, and asserted that it is expended for general purposes solely, such as public buildings, roads, assisting immigration. The twelve apostles, in an epistle dated Nauvoo, Dec. 13, 1841, declare that the tithing required is 'one tenth of all any one possessed at the commencement of tbe building of the temple, and one tenth part of all his increase from that time till the completion of the same, whether it be money, or whatever he be blessed with. Many in this place are laboring every tenth day for the house, and this is the tithing of their income, for they have nothing else.' Times and Seasons, iii. 626. Says William Hall: ' When I came to Illinois, I gave, as was required, one tenth of the amount of my whole estate to be appropriated to the building of the temple. After this, annually, I gave one tenth of the products of my farm; even the chickens, cabbages, and other vegetables in kind were turned over, with a like share of the grain.' Mormonism Exposed, 6. Mrs Stenhouse, during her first winter in Salt Lake City, made bonnets for Brigham Young's wives, for which a bill of \u00a7250 was presented to Young, when the latter gave orders that the amount should be credited to the Stenhouses for tithing.

At the conference held at Salt Lake City on April 6, 1880, it was reported that the total tithing receipts for the year ending Dec. 31, 1879, were $458,333; which amount it had cost $18,956.75\u2014 paid the bishops \u2014 to collect. S. L. C. Tribune, April 7, 1880. This report includes only the branches of the church in Utah. Coyner, in a letter to the Boston Educational Journal, dated S. L. City, Nov. 20, 1878, states that the church has an income of about $1 ,000,000 from tithing. Numerous complaints are made from the church's pulpits against delinquents who have failed to pay. In a book of travels, entitled My First Holiday, Boston, 1S81, Caroline fl. Dall wrongly asserts that the Scandinavian Mormons refuse to pay tithes. In almost any number of the Deseret News the reader may find a notice calling upon delinquents to pay their tithing. In the issue of May 14, 1853, the bishop within whose jurisdiction a saw-mill is in operation is reminded that lumber is wanted at the public yard; and in the number of July 20', 1854, the first presidency calls on every bishop throughout the territory to furnish at once lists showing who have paid aud who still owe. In a speech by Brigham, April 7, 1873, he said: 'When I reached here I could not pay one tenth, I could not pay my surplus, I could not give myall, for I had nothing.' Deseret News, April 23, 1S73. Finally, at the jubilee conference, held in celebration of the semi-centennial of the church's organization, one half of the delinquent tithes throughout the whole church, the amount being about $75,900, was re- mitted. The deserving poor of the church were further assisted on this occa- sion by the gift of 6,000 head of milch-cows and sheep, and a loan of about 34,000 bushels of wheat until after harvest, without interest. Circulars from the Twelve Apostles, S. L. City, Apr. 16, 1880. If tithing dues are satisfied by manual labor, the workman is paid from the public stores at rates which, though fixeel from time to time, are proba- bly never so low as those paid in ready money elsewhere. Captain Burton copies a price-current list for 1860, too long for me to repeat here, but which will be referred to again elsewhere, aud remarks that wheat is quoted at $1.50 per bushel, more than double its current value at the time in the valley of the Mississippi. City of the Saints, 389. Mrs Waite states that when the poor clamored, in 1802-3, because the tithing-office price of flour was $6 per hundred, they were assured that though flour would undoubtedly still advance in price, the cost to them would be no greater. But the fol- lowing winter, when, owing to the demand from the mining regions of Idaho and elsewhere, flour rose rapidly in price, the tithing-office charged $12 per hundred. This caused so great an excitement that Brigham deemed it neces sary to interfere, and the price was reduced to $6 again. It is complained in the Deseret News of Jan. 10, 1852, that merchants are paying 33 per cent more for butter than tithing-house rates, and that this action had drawn the . saints away from the tithing-house, and thus forced the laborers on the tem ple to cat their bread without butter. This was in the midst of winter, when such action might not be altogether unexpected; but we find six months later another complaint, reporting that from March 29th to July 11th there had only been received 5,lljj pounds of butter, 2,534l of cheese, and 1,182,', dozens of eggs, and inquiring how fast the work would\"\" proceed at this rate of supply.

Times and Seasons, iii. 027. Smith had been chosen to this office some time before by a general conference, at Quincy, 111. Id., ii. 579. After Smith, each president has held the position in turn. W. Richards, editor of the Deseret News, describes the system of accounts in use at the general tithing-office, in his number of Nov. 29, 1S51. A debtor and credit account was kept on a ledger, with all persons who paid tithing. When an account was settleel in full, the name was transferred to the general tithing record, or the book of 'The Law of the Lord,' and a certificate of non-in debtedness given to the person paying, which was evidence in case of a demand from the bishop of his ward. Four kinds of certificates were is sued at this time: one for property tithing due previous to Sept. 10, 1851; one for property tithing due in accordance with the vote of a confer ence of the date mentioned; and one each for labor and produce tithing. These were all for the year 1851, after which only the labor and product tithes would he required until a future conference should authorize a new levy. The business of appraising property belongs of right to the presiding bishop, but he may send one of his clerks to attend to the matter. It has been charged against Joseph Smith that his entire wealth was acquired by the diversion of tithes. The prophet, at his own estimate, had property worth one million dollars about the time of his death. He was then at the head of affairs in planning and laying out the city of Nauvoo. His estimates, based upon his faith in the prosperity of the city, may have been not unreasonable; hut with the crash of the falling walls of his temple came ruin to his estate. As the general conduct of the church under Brigham was peaceful, and therefore progressive compared with the disastrous rule of his predecessor, so opportunities increased, not only for augmenting private fortunes, but for the circulation of scandal. A writer in the Salt Lake Tribune of June 25, 1879, asserts that during Brigham's term of office he received about $13,000,000 in tithes, of which 'about $9,000,000 was squandered on his family,' and dying, left the remainder to be quarrelled over by his heirs and assigns, including the church. In July 1S59 Horace Greeley visited Brig ham, who said: ' I am the only person in the church who has not a regular calling apart from the church's service, and I never received one farthing from tier treasury. If I obtain anything from the tithing-house, I am charged with and pay for it, just as any one else would . . .1 am called rich, and con sider myself worth $250,000; but no dollar of it was ever paid me by the church, nor for any service as a minister of the everlasting gospel. I lost nearly all I had when we were broken up in Missouri and driven from that state. I was nearly stripped again when Joseph Smith was murdered, and we were driven from Illinois; but nothing was ever made up to me by the church, nor by any one. I believe I know how to acquire property, and how to take care of it.' Overland Journey to California. 213-14. The governor, in his message to the legislature in 1SS2, stated that tithing should be prohib ited. The message was referred to a committee, which reported that the ques tion being one of a purely religious character did not call for legislative action.

The names of those who do not keep the law of tithing shall not be enrolled with the people of God; neither shall their genealogy be kept. The doctrine of divine revelation is continued. God's ways are immutable; past and present to him are as one; what he has done, that he continues to do; what was right five thousand years ago is right now. If God spoke to Abraham and Solomon, and gave them more wives than one, even giving to David his neighbor's wives, there is no reason why he should not do the same with Joseph and Brigham. There is nothings which God has ever done and sanctioned that he may not do and sanction now; otherwise he is not an omniscient, omnipotent, unchangeable, all-wise, and perfect being. Every member of the church may hold communion with God relative to his own affairs ; revelations for the church are only given through its head. As through Christ alone man may be saved, in order that the souls of many millions who never heard of him may not be all of them lost, baptism for the dead, and thereby salvation, was revealed, as was also celestial marriage. Nature is dual. An unmarried man or woman is and forever must be an imperfect creature. There are marriages for time and marriages for eternity. A celestial marriage is a marriage of God, and those thus ble, and other church purposes, by the members of other religious bodies, is clearly an ecclesiastical matter, with which, as law-makers, we have nothing whatever to do, so long as the free exercise thereof does not interfere with the rights and liberties of others. Tithing is not, as we understand it, a new doctrine, for, as a religious privilege and duty, Abraham paid tithes to Melchisedek about four thousand years ago. We are not aware, however, that exactions of tithings are made in this territory, even by ecclesiastical authority; but supposing they were, there is no law by which payment can be enforced, nor is it likely there ever will be, for it is a matter not within the constitutional province of legislative enactment. If any citizen in the territory feels aggrieved by reason of the payment of tithes or other church donations, he holds the remedy in his own hands by simply renouncing con nection with any religious body requiring such donations,'"], [407, "MARRIAGE AND SEALING. 353 joined can never be divorced, except by the power of God. Isa man's wife dies and he marries another, and she dies and he marries a third, believing in resurrection and a life of purity beyond the grave but repudiating polygamy, how will he manage with bis plural wives in heaven ? She who dies unmarried cannot enter into the full enjoyment of God; but as a man may be bap tized for the dead and so save their souls, so he may be sealed to a husbandless woman in heaven. There is a difference between marriage and sealing; the former is secular, and the latter both secular and celestial, as it may be either for time or for eternity, in person or by proxy, and with the living or with the dead. A woman may be sealed to one man for time and to another for eternity, the former being still living.16 \" Gentile marriage and divorce are not recognized as valid in the Mormon church. In its early days, the church had no marriage ordinances of its own, and the requirements, conditions, and ceremonies incident to the rite were similar to those of the various protestant sects. Nor had it officials legally qualified to marry, other, perhaps, than a few such men as Sidney Rigdon, who, having been duly appointed to preside over churches of other denomi- nations, were still competent to join in legal marriage. In 1836, when the church was three years old and the Kirtland temple about to be dedicated, we find Joseph petitioning the court of Medina county, Ohio, for licenses permitting his elders to perform marriage ceremonies, which authority had been refused them by the Geauga county court. Mil. Star, xv. 708. Later, when the church had gained power, the result of more complete organization, Joseph announced, as its belief respecting marriage, that it ' should be solemnized in a public meeting, or feast, prepared for that pur- pose,' and that the celebrant should be 'a presiding high-priest, bishop, elder, or priest.' But no prohibition was issued against marriage by any other authority. Neither were church-members forbidden to marry out of the church, though any so doing would be considered weak in the faith. In the edition of Doctrine and Covenants, published at S. L. City in 1876, a revela- tion of the prophet's purporting to explain 1st Cor., vii. 14, is construed as forbidding marriages between believers and unbelievers. Ann Eliza Webb, who wa3 twice married according to Mormon practice, once by Brigham, and afterward to him, thus describes the ceremonies: After registration, which includes name, age, place of birth, with county, state, or country, ' we went before Brigham Young, who was waiting for us,' and who asked, ' Do you. Brother James Dee, take Sister Ann Eliza Webb by the right hand, to re- ceive her unto yourself, to be your lawful and wedded wife, and you to be her lawful and wedded husband, for time and eternity, with a covenant and promise on your part that you will fulfil all the laws, rights, and ordinances pertaining to this holy matrimony, in the new and everlasting covenant, do- ing this in the presence of God, angels, and these witnesses, of your ov, n free will and accord?' 'Yes.' 'Do you, Sister Ann Eliza Webb, take Brother James Dee by the right hand, and give yourself to him, to be his lawful and wedded wife, for time and for all eternity, with a covenant and promise on your part that you will fulfil all the laws, rights, and ordinances pertaining to this holy matrimony, in the new and everlasting covenant, doing this in ilBT.

'Yes.' 'In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the author ity of the holy priesthood, I pronounce you legally and lawfully husband and wife, for time and for all eternity. And I seal upon you the blessings of the holy resurrection, with power to come forth in the morning of the first resur rection, clothed with glory, immortality, and everlasting lives; and I seal upon you the blessings of thrones, and dominions, aud principalities, and powers, and exaltations, together with the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And I say unto yo'i, Be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth, that you may have joy and rejoicing in your prosperity in the day of the Lord Jesus. All these blessings, together with all other blessings per taining to the new and everlasting covenant, I seal upon your heads, through your faithfulness unto the end, by the authority of the holy priesthood, in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy ghost. Amen.' 'The scribe then entered the date of the marriage, together with the names of my mother and the one or two friends who accompanied us. ' When the marriage is a polygamous one, the wife stands on the left of her husband, and the bride at her left hand. The president then puts this question to the wife: 'Are you willing to give this woman to your husband, to be his lawful and wedded wife for time and for all eternity? If you are, you will manifest it by plac ing her right hand within the right hand of your husband.' The right hands of the husband and bride being thus joined, the wife takes her husband by the left arm, as in walking, and the ceremony then proceeds as in the manner quoted above. Young's Wife No. 19, 3S8. Mrs Stenhouse, who gave a po lygamous wife to her husband, states that in her case the ceremony was per formed at the altar, her husband kneeling on one side, and the two women opposite him; the wife being required to join the hands of the contracting parties as in the other case; but it does not appear that she afterward took her husband's arm. Indeed, the position of the three would render this im practicable. See Tell It A 11, 453^4. Of course, as these ceremonies took place in the endowment house, the temple robes were worn. But apart from ordinary marriage as known among gentiles, remarriage of converts and polygamous unions, the church in its beneficence, by an addi tional marriage rite, secures to her children eternal salvation accompanied with permanent positions of rank. This is effected by the ceremony known as spiritual marriage, based upon the following tenets: No unmarried man or woman can be eternally saved. One woman can save one man only; but a man can be instrumental in the salvation of an indefinite number of women. Sealing may be either for the dead, or for those yet alive. Persons sealed on earth need not necessarily live together. 'Brigham, in a discourse delivered in Nauvoo, Apr. 0, 1845, announces the doctrine in the following language: 'And I would say, as no man can be perfect without the woman, so no wo man can be perfect without a man to lead her. I tell you the truth as it is in the bosom of eternity; and I say so to every man upon the face of the earth: if he wishes to be saved, he cannot be saved without a woman by his side. This is spiritual wifeism, that is, the doctrine of spiritual wives.' Times and Seasons, vi. 955. \\ 'No woman can be sealed to two husbands; she must choose which it shall be whom she will marry for eternity. The man can be sealed to as many wives as he pleases. If the husband will be baptized for a former husband who perhaps died out of the church, then it leaves the wife at lib erty to make that choice. If she feels that her second husband is her pref erence, she can be baptized for some dead female, and have her sealed to her dead husband, so as to secure his conjugal happiness forever.'

To this end are sent forth proselyting ministers, elders of the church, selected by sealed or married to the husband, for and in the name of the deceased wife, for all eternity; and, secondly, to be married for time and eternity herself, to the same man. Thus, by this holy ordinance, both the dead and the liv ing wife will be his iu the eternal worlds. But if, previous to marriage for eternity, a woman lose her husband by death, and marry a second, and if her first husband was a good man, then it is the duty of the second husband to be married to her for eternity, not lor herself, but hi the name of her deceased husband, while ho himself can only be married to her for time; and he is obliged to enter into a covenant to deliver her up, and all her children, to her deceased husband, in the morning of the first resur%;ctioii.

Or again, a woman \u2014 a spinster, for instance \u2014 who has taken a particular fancy to any deceased sumt, and who wishes to become his consort in the world to come, can be sealed to him by proxy by becoming the wife of some living saint. She has first to be sealed on earth before she can obtain the necessary introduction into heaven. When a woman is said to be sealed to a man, it does not neces sarily imply that she is married to him. It may mean marriage, or it inaj simply amount to an arrangement to marry, to be consummated in the next wond, made either directly between the two parties, or by proxy by another party iu place of one of the two interested parties who is dead, . . .even if she prefers being the consort of Abraham, Isaac, Moses, Job, etc., for the Mormon spiritual- wife doctrine even ventures to go the length of this!

Brigham, as head of the church, claimed authority not only to marry, but also to uivorec at will. No law's delay, no filing of bills, summoning witnesses, or learned decision granting absolute or partial severance, accompanied by partial or impartial award of property and the custody of infants, was required. Given the approbation of the chief, aud the rest followed as speedily as a clerk could write the certificate and receive the fee. In a district removed from the capital, only the consent of the bishop is necessary, and the bill of divorce ment is a very simple writing. 'March 18, 1871. To whomsoever it may concern.

Neither age nor pecuniary condition governs the selection. They may be men or boys, rich or poor; but they must have faith and integrity, and go forth without purse or scrip, relying alone upon the hand of God to feed them. An elder is likewise selected by the church authorities to preside over each mission. Thus has been visited almost every quarter of the globe, the book of Mormon being mean while translated into many languages. And a Per petual Emigration Fund Company has been estab lished, which has advanced the funds to bring out thousands to Zion, the money being paid back by the immigrant after his arrival, as he has been able to earn it. Temple building is a characteristic work, and is prompted by the belief that Jesus Christ will some day come suddenly to his temple. Hence the devotion and self-sacrifice practised by Christ's people in order to prepare for him a fitting place of reception. Won ders in this direction have been accomplished by a poor and wandering people, at Kirtland, at Nauvoo, at Salt Lake City, St George, Manti, and Logan. \u2022 In the north-west corner of Temple block, Salt Lake City, in which is the taberuacle, the smaller church building, and the new temple, stands a plain two-story adobe structure known as the Endowment House. Here are conducted the most secret and solemn mysteries of the church, which may be termed religio-masonic ceremonies, illustrative of the origin and destiny of man. Here also are performed the rites of baptism for the dead, anointing with oil, mar riage, and other ceremonies, by which the convert is endowed with the special grace of God, receives his inheritance as a child of God, and is made a partaker of the fulness of all the blessings of religion. All these rites should properly be performed in the temple, which on its completion will supersede the endowment"], [411, "ENDOWMENT. 357 house, and in which special apartments are being con structed for these purposes.17 11 The ceremony of Endowment, or as it i3 termed, going through the en dowment house, occupies usually about eight hours. It has been described at length by several persons who have experienced it, and I give herewith a condensation of the most reliable accounts. Minor changes have been intro duced since the days of Joseph Smith, but, iu the main, the rites are as they were in the beginning. Certain days in each week, throughout the year, are set apart, upon which candidates present themselves at the endowment house, as early as seven o'clock a. m. Each is required to bring a bottle of the best olive-oil, and supposed to bring his robes also, although it is common to borrow the latter from friends, tor the first appearance, after which every good Mormon possesses his own. These garments aro described as follows: The temple robe, alike for both sexes, is a long, loose, flowing garment, made of white linen or bleached muslin, and reaching to the ankle. It is gathered to a band sufficiently long to pass around the body from the right shoulder underneath the left arm, thus leaving the latter free. A lineu belt holds it in place. The women wear a head covering made of a large square of Swiss muslin, gathered in one corner so as to form a sort of cap to sit the head, the remainder falling down as a veil. For the men, a round piece of linen, drawn up with a string and a bow in front, something after the fashion of a Scotch cap, is used. The under garment, which is also alike for both sexes, is a sort of jacket and trousers together, something like the night-dresses made for children; and is worn night and day. When changed, only an arm or a leg must be removed at once, the fresh garment being thus put on as the other is taken off. This garment protects from disease, and even death, for the bullet of an enemy will not penetrate it. The prophet Joseph carelessly left off this garment on the day of his death, and had he not done so, he would have escaped unharmed. Over the inner garment the men wear an ordinary shirt, and the women a white skirt. White stockings aud a pair of- white linen slippers complete the costume. Entering the building, the candidate's own name and age are registered, and also the names of the parents. The candidates hand in their oil, remove their shoes, and pass with their bundles of clothing into a bath-room divided down the middle by a heavy curtain which separates the sexes. Here the ceremony of purification is performed, the women being washed by women, and the men by men. The person washed is informed that ho or she is now cleansed from the blood of this generation, and if faithful, shall never be subject to the plagues and mis eries which are about to come upon the earth. Next follows the anointing. The oil is poured from a large horn into the hand of the person officiating, and applied to the crown of the head, eyes, ears, mouth, aud feet of the candidate. The eyes are touched, that they may be quick to see; tho cars, that the hear ing may be sharp; tho mouth, to bestow wisdom upon speech; and the feet, that they be swift to run in the ways of the Lord. Then a new name, which is rarely to be mentioned, is whispered into the ear, and all are marched into room No. 2, where they are seated, the sexes on opposite sides of tbe room, and facing each other. Here they are told by a priest that any person not strong enough to proceed may retire; but if any portion of the ceremony is disclosed, the throat of the person so offending will be cut from ear to ear. Those faltering, if any, having retired, the remainder are taken into room No. 3, where a representation of the creation, the temptation, and fall is given. Each candidate then puts on over his robe an apron of white linen, upon which are sewn pieces of green silk representing fig-leaves, and also the cap or veil. All good Mormons are buried in their endowment robes, and the veil worn by the women covers their faces when they are consigned to the grave. In the morning of the resurrection, this veil is to be lifted by the husband; otherwise no woman can see the face of the almighty in the next world. This ends the first degree; and the initiated are now driven out of Eden into room No."], [412, "358 MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. The order of exercises in the tabernacle, which seats seven thousand persons, is much the same as in orthodox evangelical churches, beginning and end ing with prayer and singing, and sometimes singing and administering the sacrament in the middle of a discourse. The speaker seldom knows that he is to speak until called upon by the moderator, who regu lates the services, and makes the selection under inspi ration, announcing the name of the person sometimes without knowing whether he is in the house, or even in the city. The singing is very fine, the organ, con structed wholly by Mormon artisans, being the largest 4, which represents the world, where they encounter many temptations, the cliief of which is the false gospel preached by methodists, baptists, etc. Finally St James and St John appear and proclaim the true gospel of Mormonism, which all gladly embraee. After this they receive certain grips and pass-words, and all are arranged in a circle, kneel, and the women lower their veils. Then, with the right hand uplifted, an oath is taken to avenge the death of Joseph Smith, jun. , upon the gentiles who had caused his murder, to teach the children of the church to do likewise, to obey implicitly and without murmur or question all commands of the priesthood, to refrain from adultery, and finally, eternal secrecy concerning all that transpired in the endowment house is promised. Then comes an address, after which another room is entered, leading from which is a door with a hole in it, covered with a piece of muslin. The men approach this door iu turn and ask to enter. Then a person behind the door reaches through the opening, and with knife in hand cuts a certain mark on the left breast of the shirt, another over the abdomen, and one over the right knee, which marks are faithfully copied by the women in their own garments after returning to their homes. The man then mentions his new name, gives the grip of the third degree, and is permitted to pass in. This is called go ing behind the veil. When the men are all in, each woman is passed through by her husband, or having none, by one of the brethren. This concludes the ceremony, with the exception of marriage, which will be noticed elsewhere. Of these ceremonies Mrs Stenhouse, from whose account the foregoing is partly taken, says: 'About what was done in Nauvoo, I can only speak by hear say, but have been told many strange and revolting stories about the cere monies which were there performed. Of the endowments in Utah, everything was beautifully neat and clean, and I wish to say most distinctly that, al though the initiation appears now to my mind as a piece of the most ridiculous absurdity, there was, nevertheless, nothing in it indecent or immoral.

The acoustic properties of the oval-shaped room and ceil ing are wonderful; stationed at one point, a pin may be heard drop at the opposite end. The singers, thirty or forty in number, are stationed on the main stage, facing the audience in front of the organ. In front of them are the church officials, seated on a series of platforms according to their respective grades, the first presidency highest, next the twelve apostles, and finally the teachers, priests, and bishops, who have charge of administering the sacrament of the Lord's supper, which is done regularly every Sunday. In the first organization of the church, bread and wine were specified as the proper elements to be used, but it was soon after revealed that it makes no difference what the emblems are, and now bread and water are used. Tabernacle services are held Sunday after noons ; there are Sunday-schools at the ward meeting houses Sunday mornings, and preaching at the same places in the evening by subordinate officials, who often repeat the main points of the morning taber nacle discourse. In the tabernacle, several rows of the best seats are reserved for gentile strangers, and are filled for the most part by travellers and tourists, American and European, who take no pains to hide their contempt for all about them, and return the courtesy extended by smiles and sneers, which, to say the least, is in bad taste for people pretending to a superior culture.18 18 One or two other matters of belief I may mention here. There was early established the order of Enoch. The prophet Joseph not only indorsed the biblical account of the translation of Enoch, but added to it. There was not only one Enoch, but a whole city full. This city of Enoch was located where are now the waters of the gulf of Mexico, and its inhabitants were absolutely perfect. Many sought to reach this place, for its fame had be come noised abroad; but none were successful, owing to wanderings and bickerings by the way. Within its gates all things were held in common, and unalloyed happiness reigned. And inasmuch as the people of Enoch were unfitted by their moral excellence to mingle with other earthly inhabi tants, they were removed to celestial realms. Joseph's idea at this time seems to have been to induce his followers to surrender all rights, including that of property, into the hands of the church. In May 1S31 it was revealed, 'And again, let the bishop appoint a storehouse unto this church, and let all"], [414, "MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. 360 After all that can be said about Mormonism and polygamy in their social or moral relations, it is only when we come to consider them in their politicals as pect, in their relations to government and governing, things, both in money and in meat, which is more than is needful for the wants of this people, be kept in the hands of the bishop.' Times and Seasons, v. 416. This revelation was for the information and guidance of the first bishop, Partridge, who is authorized therein to take what he wants for himself and family. The prophet's revelation concerning the order of Enoch is without date, and is entitled ' Revelation given to Enoch concerning the order of the church for the benefit of the poor.' In it is prescribed that there shall be two treasuries: from the first, to be called ' the sacred treasury of the Lord,' nothing can be taken but by the voice of the order, or by commandment; into the second treasury are to be cast all moneys except those reserved for sacred purposes. It is also provided that general consent is necessary for the withdrawal of funds from this, as in the case of the first repository, but common consent in this case is construed to be, if any man shall say to the treasurer, ' I have need of a certain sum,' he shall receive it, provided the asker shall be in full fellowship. The revelation in full will be found in Doctrine and Covenants, 283-9. One of the grounds of complaint brought against the saints in Caldwell county, by the Missourians, was that the former were com munists, as has been narrated already. Says the Salt Lake Tribune of May 9, 1874: ' The Mormons paid the United States authorities $318,000 for public lands in Missouri, but were not allowed to enjoy one acre of their purchase. ' See also Deseret News, May 13, 1874. At Nauvoo, Joseph had himself appointed trustee in trust of the whole church, and thereafter we hear uo more of the order of Enoch until some years subsequent to the establishment of the Deseret colonies. Soon after Joseph's death we find Brigham sole trustee of affairs. During the scenes following the murder of the Smiths, the expulsion from Illinois, and up to the settlement of the migratory saints in Utah, there was little property to care for; but after that, attention was again turned to the matter. Robinson, in his Sinnsrs and Saints, gives a copy of a deed: 'Bo it known by these presents, that I, Jessie W. Fox, of Great Salt Lake City, in the county of Great Salt Lake, and territory of Utah, for and in consideration of the sum of one hundred ($100) dollars and the good-will which I have to the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints, give and convey unto Brigham Young, trustee in trust for the said church, his successor in office and assigns, all my claims to and ownership of the following-described property, to wit: One house and lot, $1,000; one city lot, $100; east half of lot 1, block 12, $50; lot 1, block 14, $75; two cows, $50; two calves, $15; one mare, $100; one colt, $50; one watch, $20; one clock, $12; clothing, $300; beds and bedding, $125; one stove, $20; household furniture, $210; total, $2,127; together with all the rights, privileges, and appurtenances thereunto belonging or appertaining. I also covenant and agree that I am the lawful claimant and owner of said property, and will warrant and forever defend the same unto the said trustee in trust, his suc cessor in office and assigns, against the claims of my heirs, assigns, or any person whomsoever.' Then follows the attestation of the witness, and the formal certificate of the judge of the probate court that the signer of the above transfer personally appeared before him on April 2, 1857, and made the customary acknowledgment. Robinson also gives a list of rules, which I have not room for in detail, but which the reader may find in pp. 223-5, in the work already quoted. William Hall, who was a member of the church from 1840 until 1847, says that at the time of the exodus from Nauvoo a mercantile firm was appointed to act as trustees, not only for the church property, but also for individuals. These trustees were to sell the property"], [415, "OPPONENTS OF POLYGAMY. 361 that we touch the core of the matter. Those who wax the hottest against the latter-day saints and their polygamous practices are not as a rule among the purest of our people. They care no mure, indeed, left behind, and account to the proper owners. Mormonism Exposed, 66-70. Says Ex-elder John Hyde, jun. : 'In 1854 Brigham Young commanded the people to consecrate by legal transfer all right and title to all personal prop erty. Quitclaim deeds were drawn up, and from their land to their wear ing apparel the majority transferred everything to Brigham or his successor us trustee in trust for the latter-day saints; and some, in the exuberance of enthusiasm, threw in their wives and families.' Mormonism, 37-9. The legis lature, by act approved Jan. 18, 1855, legalized these transfers, and provided a form in blank therefor. See Utah Laws (eel. 1855), 268-9; (ed. 1S60), 92-3. At the semiannual conference held in Oct. 1873, the subject of reviving the order was again agitated. Elder David McKenzie touched upon the ultimate es tablishment of the order of Enoch in a very emphatic manner. Deseret News, Oct. 15, 1S73. The Salt Lake Tribune of March 21, 1S74, quotes the elder as follows: ' We should give thanks and praise to almighty God that there is a chance, a door opened, by which we may take a step towards establishing the order of Enoch.' Mrs Stenhouse says efforts were made to revive the order before the completion of the railways, which were not finished until 18G9. Englishwoman in Utah, 371-2. Rev. Clark Smith, author of a 12mo pamphlet entitled Mystery and Crime in the Land of the Ute, states that the plan for reviving the order was matured during the winter of 1873-4 at St George, where Brigham and a few of his leaders were at that time. During the early part of 1S74, scarcely a sermon was delivered without a reference to the order aud an assurance that all joining would be benefited both spiritually and temporally. On May 9th an election of officers was held. Brigham was wa3 chosen president; Geo. Smith, Danl H. Wells, and the twelve apostles, vice-presidents; David McKenzie, George Goddard, D. 0. Calder, P. A. Schettler, John T. Caine, and James Jack, secretaries; Thos W. Ellerbeck, general book-keeper; Edward Hunter, treasurer; anel Horace J. Eldridge, John Sharp, Ferezmore Little, James Van Cott, Moses Thatcher, Thos Dinwiddie, and Elijah Sheets, directors. S. L. C. Tribune, May 16, 1874. The dogma of adoption for eternity originated after Joseph's time. Hall says he first heard of it about the date of the expulsion from Nauvoo. Mor monism Exposed, 70. It was ascertained that many of the saints had inter married with gentile stock, and were thus debarred from a full enjoyment of the rights and privileges of the house and lineage of Abraham. But these lost blessings could be restored by ingraf tment upon the stock of one of the twelve tribes of Israel, represented by the twelve apostles, each of whom was deemed as in lineal descent from Abraham, tracing his consanguinity to Isaac and Jacob, and thence to himself as a chief of one of the tribes. Romans, xi. 16, is quoted as authorizing the doctrine, which requires every member of the church, except the twelve, to choose a father from oue of the latter. The father may be either younger or older than the son, but in any case assumes tho character of guardian, with full control of the labor and estate of the adopted son. Many young men give themselves over to the leaders as ' eter nal sons,' in the hope of sharing the honor of their adopted parents. W. C. Staines was Brigham's adopted son, and D. Candland, Heber C. Kimball's. '/yile, Mormonism, 110. Wilbert Earls is also mentioned as Kimball's son. Hall, Mormonism Exposed, 70. About 1840, iu obedience to a special revelation, Joseph Smith established a secret society known as the Order Lodge. None save persons of high stand ing in the church could gain admission, the avowed object of the organization being induction into the higher mysteries of the priesthood. J. C. Bennett writes as follows of this order: ' The lodge-rocm is carefully prepared and"], [416, "S62 MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. about the half-dozen wives of the Mormon than about the half-dozen mistresses of the congressman. As Judge Roseborough, in a very able dictation to my stenographer, remarks: \"When I came here I was a consecrated; and from 12 to 24 spfigs of cassia, olive branches, cedar boughs, or other evergreens, are tastefully arranged about it. These are intended to represent the eternal life and unmingled bliss, which, iii tbe celestial kingdom, will be enjoyed by all who continue in full fellowship. '... The candielate is stripped naked, blindfolded, and in this condition marched around the lodge room, the most excellent Grand Master repeating: ' I will bring the blind by a way they know not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.' The candidate having knelt before the altar, the following oath is administered: 'In the name of Jesus Christ, the son of God, I now promise and swear, truly, faithfully, and without reserve, that I will serve the Lord with a perfect heart and a willing mind, dedicating myself, wholly and unreservedly, in my person and effects, to the upbuilding of his kingdom on earth, according to his revealed will. I furthermore promise and swear that I will regard the first president of the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints as the supreme head of the church on earth, and obey him the same as the supreme God, in all written revela tions, given under the solemnities of a \" thus saith the Lord, \" and that I will always uphold the presidency, right or wrong. I furthermore promise and swear that I will\" never touch a daughter of Adam unless she is given me of the Lord. I furthermore promise and swear that no gentile Bhall ever be admitted to the secrets of this holy institution, or participate in its blessings. I furthermore promise and swear that I will assist the Daughter of Zion in the utter destruction of apostates, and that I will assist in setting up the Kingdom of Daniel in these last days, by the power of the highest and the sword of his might. I furthermore promise and swear that I will never com municate the secrets of this degree to any person in the known world, except it be to a true and lawful brother, binding myself under no less a penalty than that of having melted lead poured into my ear. So help me God and keep me faithful. ' J list, of the Saints, 275-6. I have thousands of references to articles written and sermons preached on the doctrines of the church.

This is why the people of Missouri and Illinois drove them out \u2014 not because of their religion or immorality, for their religion was nothing to the gentiles, and their morals were as good or better than those of their neighbors. It may as well be understood and agreed upon that, in the United States or out of the United States, the Mor mons are, and ever will be, a people self-contained and apart. Thus the matter continues to be discussed by the world at large, as a question of theology or morality, and not of active political and judicial control, or of the domination of a politico-religious organization, with aspirations and purposes diverse from those of the American people generally. The theory and assumption of the Mormon church as a politico-religious organization is that the church is a government of God, and not responsible to any other government on earth conflicting with it, if not indeed bound from necessity to overturn and supplant all civil governments. This assumption lies at the very foundation of the Mormon creed; and from this point, in practical operation as well as in theory, there is a divergence between that organization and the United States government. Grant that any man believes what the Mormons believe, say their enemies, and where will his allegiance rest \u2014 with the government of the United States, or with this politico-religious or ganization which ought to and will, as they imagine, supplant all other governments? Many of them are alien born, and, from the treatment they receive on their arrival, learn to distrust the. government of the United States, and to cling all the closer to the insti tutions of their sect. \" It is not consistent that the people of God,\" says Orson Pratt, \" should organize or be subject to man made governments. If it were so, they could never"], [423, "THE MORMON CHURCH. 369 be perfected. There can be but one perfect govern ment \u2014 that organized by God, a government by apos tles, prophets, priests, teachers, and evangelists; the order of the original church of all churches acknowl edged by God.\" Early in this narrative we saw plainly, and re marked upon it as we proceeded, that it has been chiefly the political character and aspirations of the church that have brought it into all its difficulties everywhere \u2014 in Ohio, in Missouri, in Illinois. And its thirty years of isolation and independence in Utah, during which time it came in contact with the American people or with the government only in a limited degree, intensified its desire for con trol. The only way the Mormons can live in peace with gentile neighbors is for them to follow the ex ample of their brethren, the Josephites \u2014 leave politics and government out of their ethics, and not combine for the purpose of controlling counties, states, or ter ritories. But this strikes at the very root of their religion, which has already given them for an inher itance all counties and countries and peoples through out the world, as they modestly claim. There is here much more than the religious unity of ancient Israel. As a cooperative association, Mor monism has not its equal in the history of the world. In every conceivable relation, position, interest, and idea; in every sentiment of hope and fear, of joy and sorrow \u2014 there is mutual assistance and sympathy. It enters into all affairs, whether for time or eternity; there is an absolute unity in religion, government, and society, and to the fullest extent short of communism, mutual assistance in agriculture, commerce, and manu factures. If a foreign convert wishes to come to Amer ica, he is helped hither; if he wants land, farming imple ments, seed, stock, he is helped to them ; trade and man ufactures are largely cooperative. And this bond of strength, whether it be called the holiness of saints or Hist. Utah. 24"], [424, "MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY 370 the bigotry of fanatics, causes them to be feared and hated by their neighbors. Polygamy, as a tenet of the Mormon church, is based upon scripture example, and if this is unlaw ful, it says, all is unlawful. Marriage is ordained of God, and essential to salvation. Christian sects hold up the patriarchs as examples in their sacred instruction, and yet condemn in these personages a practice which Christ nowhere condemns. While in polygamy, God blessed them and their polyga mous seed, saying never a word about their plural wives. Polygamy was common in Asia at the time of the apostles; yet none of them preached against it, nor does John the revelator mention it, writing to the seven churches. In the days of Justin Mart}rr, the Jews practised polygamy. It is true that the emperor Theodosius, about a. d. 393, promulgated a law against polygamy, but it was repealed sixty years after by Valentinian. Nevertheless, as the civilized world, particularly Christian sects, regarded the prac tice with abhorrence, the prophet Joseph inquired of the Lord as to what he should do. And the Lord answered, commanding him to restore all things, the practice of polygamy among the rest. The revelation on this subject is given entire in note 19 of this chap ter. The inferior order of wifehood, known in the sacred scriptures as concubinage, is not recognized in the Mormon church. By the marriage covenant, all are made wives, and all children are legitimate. Celestial marriage and the plural-wife system, as incorporated parts of the Mormon religion, are essen tial to the fulness of exaltation in the eternal world. The space around us, it declares, is inhabited by spirits, thousands of years old, awaiting tabernacles in the flesh, which can be legitimately furnished them only by marriage and procreation; and bodies cannot be obtained for these spirits fast enough unless men have more wives than one. It is the will aud glory of God"], [425, "THE ETHICS OF POLYGAMY. 371 that these spirits have bodies as speedily as possible, that they become saints on earth and in his kingdom, those who keep this commandment thus to multiply being as gods; otherwise these spirits will take refuge in the bodies of unbelievers, and so sink to perdition. But civilization has pronounced polygamy a curse and a crime, a retrogression, an offence against society and against morality, a beastly abomination, immoral, incestuous, degrading, a relic of barbarism, a sin, a shame, a vice, and as such has discarded it and passed laws against it. And the issue between polygamy and monogamy is one purely for civilization to determine; Christianity has not a foot of ground to stand upon in the matter. Culture cares nothing for religion; it is what a man does, not what he believes, that affects progress. It will not do to break the law in the name of religion. Suppose a man's religion authorizes him to commit murder: does that make it right? Civilization seeks the highest morality; and the highest morality, it says, is not that of the bible, of the book of. Mormon, or of any other so-called holy book. The highest morality is based on nature, and by a study of nature's laws men may find it. Long before Christ, civilization awoke to the evils of this custom, which is not in accord with its morality. The religious reformer, Buddha, who died 470 years before Christ was born, and whose followers now number about one third of the whole human race, preached against polygamy. When Greece and Rome were the foremost nations of the world, they did not practise polygamy, nor has ever the highest civilization entertained it. Polygamy is to monogamy as Greece to China, or as England to India. All very religious people, as well as science fanat ics, are partially insane. This insanity may be pas sive and harmless, or aggressive and hurtful. We have innumerable instances of both kinds in the his tory of the Christian church. But as the world"], [426, "MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. 372 progresses, religion becomes less dogmatic, and the insanity assumes more and more the milder form. Thus it is with the Mormons as with others; they would not feel justified in doing now some things which were done by their predecessors, any more than gentile Christians would wish to burn here tics, or slaughter millions in the name of the re deemer; or any more than they would accept Joseph Smith as a prophet from God, or believe in his metal book of Mormon, or his pretended revelations. But admitting man's obligation to follow the pre cepts and example of the bible, which, if done literally, would lead him into all manner of contrarieties and absurdities, even as it does the Mormons to-day, the scriptural argument in support of polygamy does not go for much. Among the half-savage Israelites the custom obtained, but as they grew more civilized, it died out. The first apostles had none of them two wives, and St Paul maintained that it was best not to have any; the spirit of the new testament is all against plurality of wives, and, though it nowhere in so many words condemns the system, the books of Mormon and doctrine and covenants do. Thus we see that holy books are contradictory and unreliable, not being consistent in themselves, or pro ducing consistent followers. Codes of morality de pending on the divine will are without foundation : are, indeed, not codes of morality, which to be genuine must be based on nature as the law-giver and punisher; for otherwise all men to whom the will of God has not been revealed, or who do not believe in any god or revelation, would be without any knowledge of right and wrong, or any standard of morality. Innate perceptions, supernatural intuitions, or a con science divinely given, instead of one evolved from the ever-increasing accumulation of human experiences, are not safe guides to right conduct, as the doctrines and doings of the Mormons clearly show. By the re sult of an act, not by supernatural revelation, we know"], [427, "MONOGAMY AND POLYGAMY. 373 whether it is good or bad ; and here, the result being bad, the act is wrong, immoral. The result is bad because by reason of the act civ ilization takes a step backward, woman is degraded, and the progress of the race hampered. The mono gamic is the highest type of family, and the highest type of society, yet evolved. Polygamy is better than promiscuity or polyandry, but it is not equal to mo nogamy. Polygamy springs from the desire to extend the sexual gratification at the expense of the better sense of the better part of the world's inhabitants. It is but a few removes from the old way among sav ages, where women were property, and bought by hus bands to be used as slaves. To monogamy is due the fullest development of the emotions, of the higher sentiments, motherly tenderness, fatherly care, and the dutiful respect and obedience on the part of chil dren. It is here that the passion of love assumes its most refined form ; it is here that we find in family, social, and political relations, the greatest good to the greatest number. For if we degrade woman, we degrade her children, her husband, and the whole community. Through out all ages the position of woman has fixed the ad vancement of the nation in the scale of refinement and intelligence. Polygamy makes of woman, not the equal and companion of man, but his subordinate, if not indeed his serf or slave. The charm of her in fluence is gone; the family circle becomes incongruous and less cohesive;. and there is an absence of those firm relations, filial and paternal, which, continued through successive generations, engender the highest type of society yet known. Make of American wo men Circassian slaves, and you will make of American men Turks. The nations having the highest and best literature, laws, commerce, and religion, the nations that are enlightening the world with their books, telegraphs, steamboats, and railroads, are monogamic. Polygamy"], [428, "MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. 374 encourages, if it does not necessitate, a domestic des potism, which, united with a religious and political despotism, constitutes one of the worst possible of social evils. It adds to the Mormons numbers and strength, banding them in a peculiar brotherhood, politically and socially. The system is not an equitable one. There are born a tolerably even number of males and females, so that under this arrangement, where one man had a dozen wives, a dozen or so men would have none. Then, as to the relationships of the individual members, in justice is wrought, some of them being but little bet ter than those existing among animals. There is an instinct in every woman which tells her that to be second or third is to be no wife at all. Neglect must exist. One man cannot properly care for so many women and children. Even if he is wealthy, he has not the time. Differences of origin and interests breed jealousies, foster selfishness, and are injurious to character. Then, when the reproductive age has passed, there is nothing left for the wife but a lonely and miserable old age. Further than this, if reproduction be the chief in centive to the plural-wife system among the Mormons, and if it be true, as is often asserted, that as a rule the sexes are born numerically equal, then the system will in the end defeat its own object, for more chil dren will be born and cared for where there is one man for every woman than where some women have to go without a husband, or with a fraction of one. It might pertinently be asked, in this connec tion, what is the benefit in multiplying the popula tion? Are there not enough people already in the world? and is it not better to improve the stock than unduly to multiply it? This prevention is practised often for improper motives and by injurious methods; but millions do it because they think they cannot afford to raise children, and have no right to bring them into existence."], [429, "THEOCRACY AND REPUBLICANISM. 375 True, the evils of the practice arc not so great under a theocratic and patriarchal system like that of the Mormons, as it would be if allowed to run riot round the world, giving libertines the widest opportunity to deceive and then desert women; in which case there would be no need of prostitution to satisfy men's pas sions, as the great barriers between the virtuous and the' lewd would be for the most part broken down. Among the Mormons, this is prevented by strong re ligious feeling, and by the patriarchal influence of the leaders. But the majority of mankind in the great outside world are not controlled by religion or reason \u2014 they simply drift. Whether for this reason or some other reason, Mor mons are not loyal to the government, and the issue is between polygamic theocracy and American repub licanism. Nor are the fears of the friends of the lat- ter wholly groundless; for, as one writer said of it, \"the Mormon church is one of the best organized systems in the world. The cunning of the devil and the sophistry of error are so mingled with truth as to make it one of the most powerful agencies to delude the ignorant.\" The truth is, the theocratic organiza tion has already become absolute. Opposition stimu lates propagandism, and persecution brings only de fiance of federal authority and the moral sense of the nation. Legislation is defeated at every turn. The history of Utah is the history of the Mormon priest hood in its attempt to subordinate the state to tho church, and make the authority of the priesthood su perior to that of the United States government. So says civilization. In answer, polygamy reiterates scriptural example and divine command, and repudiates civilization wherever it interferes with religion. Culture aud progress, which set at defiance God's law, are of the devil. There is no retrogression in* keeping the com mands of the most high. God blessed Abraham, and"], [430, "MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. 376 David, and Solomon; polygamy is no curse; And that cannot be a sin which God commands; that can not be a vice which has for its accomplishment only the highest and holiest purposes of the almighty; that cannot be against morality which is practised only by the righteous, and for the pure and eternal welfare of the human race.19 \"For a time, in so far as possible, the practice of polygamy in Illinois and Utah was kept secret by the missionaries in England and in Europe. Says Parley P. Pratt in Manchester, and iu the Millennial Star of 1S4G, ' Such a doctrine is not held, known, or practised as a principle of the latter-day saints;' and John Taylor at the Boulogne discussion, in France, in July 1850, says, ' We are accused here of polygamy and actions the most indelicate, ob scene, and disgusting, such as none but a corrupt heart could have conceived. These things are too outrageous to be believed.' On the morning of Aug. 29, 1852, before a special conference in session at S. L. City, Orson Pratt preached on the subject of marriage, in which dis course he stated, ' It is well known, however, to the congregation before me, that the latter-day saints have embraced the doctrine of a plurality of wives as part of their religious faith. ' In the evening, whilst the sacrament was being passed, Brigham addressed the audience, saying in the course of his re marks, ' Though that doctrine [polygamy] has not been preached by the elders, this people have believed in it for many years. ' At the close of Brigham's address, the revelation of July 12, 1843, was read by Elder Thomas Bullock. The proceedings of this conference were published in full in an Svo pamphlet of 48 pages, issued as au extra by the Deseret News, on Sept. 14, 1852, when the revelation first saw the light. It next appeared in the Millennial Star, and may now be found in the book of Doctrine and Covenants. Herewith i give the revelation entire. Revelation given to Joseph Smith, at Nauvoo, July 12, 1843: ' Verily, thus Baith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you have inquired of my hand to know and understand wherein I, the Lord, justilied my servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as also Moses, David, and Solo mon, my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their having many wives and concubines: behold, and lo!

I am the Lord thy God, and I give unto you this commandment that no man shall come unto the fa ther but by me, or by my word, which is my law, saith the Lord; and every thing that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they may be that are not by me, or by my word, saith tho Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men are dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord your God; for whatsoever things remain are by me, and whatsoever things aro not by me shall be shaken and destroyed. Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me, nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in tho world, and she with him. their covenant and marriage are not of force when they arc dead, and when they aro out of the world; therefore, they aro not bound by any law when they are out of the world; therefore, when they are out of the world, they neither marry nor aro given in marriage, but are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who arc worthy of a far more and an exceeding and an eternal weight of glory; for these an gels did not abide my law, therefore they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition to all eternity, and from henceforth are not gods, but arc angels of God forever and ever. And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me or by my word, which is my law, and is not sealed by the holy spirit of prom ise, through him whom I have anointed and appointed unto this power, then it is not valid, neither of forco when they are out of the world, because they are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of the world, it can not be received there because the angels anil the gods are appointed there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore, inherit my glory, for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God. And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wifo by lny word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the holy spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood, and it shall be said unto tlioni, Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it bo after the first resur rection, iu the next resurrection; and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, prin cipalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths; then shall it be written in tho Lamb's book of life, that he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, and if he abide in my covenant, and commit no mur der whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the world, and they shall pass by tho angels and the gods which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.

But if ye receive me in the world, theu shall ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation, that where 1 am ye shall be also.

The blasphemy against the holy ghost, which shall not be forgiven in the world nor out of the world, is in that ye commit murder wherein ye shed in- nocent blood, and assent unto my death, after ye have received my new and everlasting covenant, saith the Lord God; and he that abideth not this law can in no wise cuter into my glory, but shall be damned, saith the Lord. I am the Lord thy God, and will give unto thee tho law of my holy priesthood as was ordained by me and my Father before the world was. Abraham re- ceived all things whatsoever he received by revelation and commandment by my word, saith the Lord, and hath entered into his exaltation and sitteth upon his throne. Abraham received promises concerning his seed and of the fruit of his loins\u2014 from whose loins ye are, viz., my servant Joseph\u2014 which were to continue so long as they were in the world; and as touching Abraham and his seed out of the world, they should continue; both in the world and out of the world should they continue as innumerable as the stars, or if ye were to count the sand upon the seashore, ye could not number them. This promise is yours also, because ye are of Abraham, and the promise waj made unto Abraham, and by this law are the continuation of the works of my father, wherein he glorifieth himself. Go ye, therefore, aud do the works of Abraham; enter ye into my law, and ye shall bo saved. But if ye enter not into my law, ye cannot receive the promise of my Father which he made unto Abraham. God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave Ha^ar to Abra- ham to wife. And why did she do it? Because this was the law, and from Hagar sprang many people. This, therefore, was fulfilling, among other things, the promises. Was Abraham, therefore, under condemnation? Ver- ily I say unto you, nay; for i, the Lord, commanded it. Abraham was com- manded to offer his son Isaac; nevertheless it was written thou shalt not kill. Abraham, however, did not refuse, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness. 'Abraham received concubines, and they bare him children, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness, because they were given unto him and he abode in my law; as Isaac also, and Jacob, did none other things than that which they were commanded; and because they did none other things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into their exalta tion, according to the promises, and sit upon thrones, and are not angels, but"], [433, "REVELATION ON POLYGAMY. 379 line of its moralities. It is true that monogamy was early enforced in Greece; but outside of marriage limits, there was gross indulgence in every form, which was as freely permitted and practised as among are gods. David also received many wives and concubines, as also Solomon and Moses, my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the begin ning of creation until this time, and in nothing did they sin, save in those things which they received not of me. David's wives and concubines were given unto him of me by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and iu none of these things did ha sin against me, save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and therefore ho hath fallen from his exaltation and received his portion; and he Bhall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord. I am the Lord thy God, and I gave unto thee, my servant Joseph, an appointment, and restore all things; ask what ye will, and it shall be given unto you, ac cording to my word; and as ye have asked concerning adultery, verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man receiveth a wife in the new and everlasting cove nant, and if she be with another man, and I have not appointed unto her by the holy anointing, she hath committed adultery, and shall be destroyed. If she he not in the new and everlasting covenant, and she be with another man, she has committed adultery; ami if her husband be with another woman, and he was under a vow, he hath broken his vow and hath committed adul tery; and if she hath not committed adultery, but is innocent, and hath rot broken her vow, and she knoweth it, and I reveal it unto you, my servant Joseph, then shall you have power, by the power of my holy priesthood, to take her and give her unto him that hath not committed adultery, but liath been faithful, for he shall be made ruler over many; for I have conferred upon you the keys and power of the priesthood, wherein I restore all things and make known unto you all things in due time. And verily, verily, I say unto you, that whatsoever you seal on earth shall be scaled in heaven, and what soever you bind on earth, in my name and by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in tho heavens; and whosesoever sins you remit on earth shall be remitted eternally in the heavens, and whosesoever sins you retain on earth shall be retained in heaven.

In Rome, the one-wife system was more firmly estab lished, though in the absence of marriage, chastity was little regarded. Marcus Aurelius, indeed, was eulogized by his biographer for bringing into his Smith to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment, she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord, for I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law; but if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her even as lie hath said, and I will bless him and multiply him, and give unto him a huudred-fold hi this world, of fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of eternal lives in the eternal worlds. And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses, and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has trespassed against me, and I, the Lord thy God, will bless her and multiply her, and make her heart rejoice.

Now as touching the law of the priesthood, there are many things pertaining thereunto. Verily, if a man be called of my Father, as was Aaron, by mine own voice, and by the voice of him that sent me, and I have endowed him with the keys of the power of this priesthood, if he do anything in my name, and according to my law, and by my word, he will not commit sin, and I will justify him. Let no one, therefore, set on my servant Joseph, for I will justify him; for he shall do the sacrifice which I require at his hands, for his transgressions, saith the Lord your God. And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood; if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, if and he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to on other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery, for they are given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belonged unto him, and to none else; and if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law, he can not commit adultery, for they belong to him and they are given unto him; there fore is ho justified. But if one or either of the ten virgins after she is espoused shall be with another man, she has committed adultery and shall be destroyed ; for they are given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfil the promise which was given by my father before the foundation of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my father continued, that he may be glorified. And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any mau have a wife who holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe and administer unto him, or she shall he destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy her; for I will magnify my name upon all those who receive and abide in my law. Therefore it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for him to receive all things whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, because she did not administer unto him according to my word; and she then becomes the transgressor, and he is ex empt from the law of Sarah, who administered unto Abraham according to the law, when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to wife.

If monogamy is the only natural form of sexual relationship, how happens it that, throughout the life time of the race, there have been and still are so many other forms of relationship? From time im memorial polygamy has existed, and has been sanc tioned by all religions. Bramin, Parsee, and Raj poot all indulged in it. Though nothing is said of it in the new testament, we learn from the Talmud that it was lawful among the Jews about the time of Christ's coming. Among the early converts to Chris tianity in Syna. and Egypt were many polygamists who remained uncensured. The rabbies of the west prohibited it eight or nine centuries ago, but those of the east, where it is practised by nearly all nations, permit it even now. It is common to-day through out a large part of the world. Take all the peoples of the earth, of all times and cultures, and those among whom plural wives obtained are far in excess of the others. Pre-nuptial unchastity was scarcely censured either in Greece or Rome. \"If there be any one,\" said Cicero, \"who thinks that young men should be alto- gether restrained from the love of courtesans, he is indeed very severe.\" Even that most austere of Stoics, Epictetus, makes a wide distinction between what he regards as comparatively innocent pre-nuptial indulgences, and those which were regarded as adul- terous and unlawful. While the utmost license was allowed the husband, the wife was held under close re- strictions. Courtesans were the real companions of men, and the only free women in Athens. Apelles painted them; Pindar and Simonides sang their praises. Aspasia was worshipped before Pericles, and sage philosophers did not hesitate to pay homage at her shrine, and receive words of wisdom from her lips. In imperial Rome, while the courtesan class never"], [436, "MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. 382 attained to such distinction as in Greece, divorce was so easy and frequent as to render the marriage cere mony almost a nullity. There were periods when the term 'adultery' had no significance as applied to men; only women were punished for this crime. Persons five, ten, twenty times married and divorced were not uncommon. Though monogamy obtained, female life was lower there than in England under the restoration, or in France under the regency. Alexander Seve rus, the most persistent of all the Roman emperors, in vainly legislating against vice, provided his provin cial governors, if unmarried, with a concubine as well as with horses and servants. The privilege of royalty in having many mistresses, tolerated until all the people arose and usurped roy alty, was but a modified form of polygamy, and is still secretly practised by individuals. The question of sensualism has nothing to do with it. The polygamist, as a rule, is no more sensual than the monogamist. Your true sensualist does not marry at all. He holds himself free to taste pleasure as he can find it. The trammels of matrimony and the responsibilities of parentage he alike avoids. He is the most selfish of beings; for his own gratifica tion he is willing to sacrifice society, debase manhood, and doom to perdition the highest inspirations and holiest affections of the race. Beastliness is hardly a fit word to apply to the exercise of an animal impulse, the gratification of animal appetite. It too often maligns the brute cre ation. Eating and sleeping are in one sense beastly; while smoking and dram-drinking are worse than beastly. Beasts are natural in all things. In many respects they are less open to the charge of beastli ness, as we commonly employ the term, than men; they indulge less in excess; they are sometimes glut tonish, but they do not intoxicate themselves; if they do not regulate intercourse by numbers, they do by seasons. Their passions are in subordination to the"], [437, "THE CHRISTIAN MONOGAMIST. 383 laws of nature. Man's passions are not. Taking this charge of beastliness as it is meant, the polyg amist is less beastly than the monogamist, who in the majority of cases is more beastly in his sexual intercourse than the beast, being less obedient to the laws of nature, less considerate for the health and strength of his one only wife. Millions of gentle, un complaining women have been killed by beastly hus bands putting upon them more children than they should bear, not to mention innumerable cruelties of other kinds. In so far as any system is not in accord ance with the laws of nature, nature will in due time assert her rights and put it down. It is said that the Mormon women are martyrs: so are other women; part of them because they are married, and part be cause they are not. The readers must bear in mind that these are the assertions and arguments of polygamy, and must be prepared to take them for what they are worth, and answer them each according to the light of his own reason. I have already presented the current argu ments against polygamy; these are the opinions and dogmas of the Mormons themselves, the doctrines they everywhere preach and print, teaching them to their children, inculcating them into the minds of young men and women, until they have fully imbibed them. And thus they continue. How many husbandlesswo men there are who drag out a miserable existence in the effort to sustain themselves without sin! how many fall into shame under the effort! Society lays no heavier burden on any of its members than on its poverty-stricken single women, reared in luxury, and unable to support themselves by work. If you arc so tender of woman, her position and morals, why not turn your batteries against the ten thousand of your own people of all classes, including preachers and 1' gislators, who tamper with other men's wives, seduce and abandon innocent girls, keep mis tresses, and frequent the haunts of prostitution?"], [438, "MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. 384 That the race deteriorates under the polygamous system is not true, they say. The single wife is very often hurried to a premature grave by an incon siderate or brutal husband, the offspring which she meanwhile bears being puny and ill-developed. And again, it is only the better class of men, the healthy and wealthy, the strongest intellectually and physi cally, who as a, rule have a plurality of wives; and thus, by their becoming fathers to the largest number of children, the stock is improved. The charge of immorality, as laid upon the Mor mons as a community, is likewise untenable. Morality is the doctrine of right and wrong, the rule of conduct implying honesty and sobriety. In all honesty and sobriety the Mormons live up to1 their standard of right and wrong, they claim, more completely than any other people. They indulge in fewer vices, such as drunkenness, prostitution, gambling, and like wise fewer crimes. There is nothing necessarily im moral in the practice of polygamy; if it is not immoral for a man to take one wife, it is not for him to take twelve wives. The Mormons are loyal to their consciences and convictions. They are essentially a moral people, moral in the highest sense of the term, more so, they claim, than the average American or European. They do not drink, cheat, or steal; adultery is scarcely known among them; they are not idle, profligate, or given to lying. They are true to themselves, true to their principles, and true to the world. Of what other society can you fairly say as much? They are honest in all things, and law-abiding when the law does not touch their rights or their religion; when it does, all who are not dastards will fight. Judge them by their fruits; if a sect is to be regarded from the standpoint of its imperfections and inconsistencies rather than from its results, what shall be said of Christianity, which has butchered millions for the faith,"], [439, "INEQUALITY OF THE SEXES. 385 and has further committed all the wickedness flesh is heir to, or of which Satan could conceive? It is not right to place the polygamist on a par with the bigamist. The one, without deception, and in con formity with the proclaimed tenets of his faith, takes to wife the second, or third, or twentieth \u2014 the more the better for all, it is said \u2014 promising to her the same life-long care and protection as to the first; the other breaks his contract with his first wife, and deserts her for another woman. Neither can the polygamist be justly placed on a level with the adulterer. Mor mons abhor everything of the kind. The sacred cere mony of marriage signifies far more with them than with those who mark the difference between morality and immorality by a few insignificant rites. The Mormons lay no small stress on the fact that there is always a large number of women who have no husbands, and can get none, on account of women being always so greatly in the preponderance. They deny that there are more men than women. Whatever may be true with regard to the numer ical equality or inequality of the sexes at birth, it is certain, dating back almost from the beginning, that there have always been more women than men in the world. Particularly in primitive times, owing to war or exposure, the death rate was much greater among the males than among the females. To obviate the evil \u2014 for it was early recognized that the sexes should be mated \u2014 in some instances the female children were killed, but more frequently the excess of women was divided among the men. Where wars were frequent and continuous, everything else being equal, the mo nogamous nation could not long stand before a polyg amous neighbor. Coming down to later times, it is safe to say that there are a million more women than men in Christen dom to-day; there are here five millions of women who would like to marry but cannot, being denied one of the fundamental rights of humanity by statutory law Hi\u00bbt. Utah. 25"], [440, "MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. 386 A large class of men refuse to take upon themselves the cost and cares of matrimony, preferring more free and cheaper indulgence. Of very many of these five mill- ions thus left to themselves, unmated, unsupported, forbidden to become plural wives, Christian civiliza- tion makes prostitutes or paupers. And this is the orthodox idea of the elevation of woman ! Make angels of light and happiness of one portion, while dooming the rest, under the hard heel of social despotism, to the depths of misery and despair. Nay, more : while the men are thus busied working upon the affections of women, taking advantage of their loneliness and poverty, and constantly adding to the numbers of the lost by seducing the pure from the paths of re- spectability, their sisters, mothers, wives, and daugh- ters are applying the scourge with all their might to these unfortunates, hoping thereby to gain further favor with the men by showing how much better are they than their most foully wronged sisters. Such are the men, such the society, in which the foulest wrongs to women are so universally and con stantly committed \u2014 wrongs which would put to blush savages, yea, and all the devils of darkness; such are the men who wage war on the plural-wife system, which would give to this class and all classes of wo men home and honorable alliance. Further than all this, polygamy claims that men or governments have no natural or moral right to forbid the practice, pass laws against it, and inflict punish ments. Inherent human rights are above statutory law. Governments have no right to pass laws against gambling, prostitution, drunkenness, or any act of the individual resulting in injury only to himself. He who harms another may be punished, not he who harms himself; otherwise, who is to determine what is or what is not harmful? All men and women are every day doing things harmful to themselves, but which no one thinks of checking by legislation. By no line of logic can polygamy be rightly placed in the"], [441, "POLYGAMY NOT CRIMINAL. 387 criminal category. In its worst aspect, it can only be called a vice. Drunkenness is not a crime : it is a vice. Statutory law cannot justly make criminal that which by the law of human rights is only a vice. Govern ments may repress crime, but they never can uproot vice; and the sooner legislators realize and act upon this truth, the fewer failures they will have to record. Public sentiment and moral force are the only agen cies which can be brought against this class of evils with any hope of success. The right and wrong of the matter, as usually dis cussed, are not the right and wrong of nature and common sense, but of divine and human enactment, variously interpreted and viewed from different stand points. The bible forbids prostitution, but permits polygamy; the supporters of the bible and its civili zation forbid polygamy, but permit prostitution. The Mormons are held to be a most unphilosophical sect, and yet the sentiment against them is more un philosophical than their doctrines or practices. The American congress is not a Sunday-school, neither is it within the province of government to establish and enforce a code of ethics. Congress has no more right to legislate, against their consent, for the territories than it has for the states. I do not know that all Mormons hold to this opinion, but many of them do. The idea of political nonage is only an idea; it is not a fact. Murder, theft, breach of contract, malefeasance in office, unjust monopoly, cheating, slave holding, adulteration, bigamy, etc., are crimes to be punished by law. Drunkenness, gambling, prostitu tion, and the like, are vices to be uprooted by precept and example. A crime is an injury to one's neighbor; a vice is an injury to one's self. I have no right to in jure my neighbor, but I have the right to do as I will with my own and myself, howsoever foolish may be the act. Congress, indeed, would have its hands full were it to undertake to pass laws to keep men from making fools of themselves. If polygamy must be"], [442, "MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. 388 placed in one category or the other, it must be denom inated a vice, and not a crime. If one man and three women contract to live in a connubial relationship, neither God nor nature pronounces it a crime. In bigamy the marriage contract is broken ; in polygamy it is kept. Admit that monogamy is best, that one man for one woman tends to the highest culture, it still does not prove that coercion in morals is better than precept and example. Is woman less chaste than in the days of feudalism, now that she is less watched? If the law has the right to limit a man to one wife, it may if it chooses deny him any wife, as many orders among the Greeks and Armenians, the heathens and christians, have declared. If one man is restricted by law to one woman, the least the law can do in common justice is to compel every man to marry one woman. Why does not the United States war upon the catholic priest or the unprincipled debauchee, who by refusing to take a wife repudiates the laws of nature, and sets an example which if universally fol lowed would prove the strangulation of the race? Better punish those who denaturalize themselves rather than those who are too natural.

In his message to the congress of 1SS3-4, the president favors a re peal of tho organic act, and recommends a federal commission as a substitute. In commenting upon this, the Des. News declares that the destruction of the local government will fad to destroy polygamy, neither can 'commissions, edicts, or armies, or any other earthly powers,' for the plural marriages of the Mormons are ecclesiastical, perpetual, and eternal. Says \\V. S. Godbie, a well-known writer on Mormouism, in a letter to the S. L. Tribune of Dec. 9, 1SS3, after first quoting George Q. Cannon as preaching in the tabernacle 'it is not vox populi vox Dei,' but ' vox Dei vox populi,' 'The essence of the whole Utah question lies couched in these telling words of the church organ and the leading apostle.'

As a remedy against the Mormon evil, many plans have been put forth. \"Send an army and wipe them out,\" say the unthinking masses. An army was sent once, but when it came to Utah there was nothing at hand to wipe out. But should an army go and find them there, it would hardly be prepared to enter upon the wholesale slaughter of 140,000 men, women, and children while in -pursuit of their daily vocations. Education has been urged. This means is already employed; but while there are gentile schools, the Mormons still teach Mormonism, and the more they educate, the stronger and more widely extended be comes their faith. Senator Hoar suggested seizing the perpetual emigration fund, but this appeared too much like robbery. Make marriage a civil compact, give the wife the right of dower, and so make her less dependent on the husband, some have said. Amend the constitution, prohibiting polygamy, others have urged. But if congressional enactment fails, what can constitutional amendment do? Admit Utah as a state, and let the people split into parties, and so fight out their own issues. But they will not split into parties, is the reply. If they were like other people, this might be the result; but they are not like other people. For the people to differ from their chiefs on matters of gov ernment, or on any other matters, would throw them outside the category of Mormons. Such a thing can not be. Their government, ecclesiastical and civil, is a government of God; their chief is God's prophet and vicegerent, and his will is God's will and cannot be questioned. By the Edmunds act, approved March 22, 1882, congress made polygamy punishable by disfranchisc ment, and a fine of not more than five hundred dollars, with imprisonment for not more than three years, the children to be deemed illegitimate. There have"], [450, "MORMONISM AND POLYGAMY. 39(5 been numerous convictions under this law, bringing se rious injury upon individuals, and greatly alarming the entire brotherhood. Many other schemes have been urged. Cut up the territory and divide it among the adjacent states; permit the wife to testify against her husband; compel marriages to be registered; throw in more gentile population, establishing milliners' shops for the women and whiskey-shops for the men, so that the full force of civilization may be brought to bear upon them. A proposed remedy is for congress to as sume the political powers, and govern the country by a commission of nine or thirteen members appointed for that purpose, and which, the majority being always gentiles, would adopt the necessary laws for the gov ernment of the territory, instead of congress or a legis lature. Executive and judicial affairs would go on in the usual way; and as for the municipal, the commis sion as a legislature could make such regulations as they pleased, providing for the appointment of mayors by the governor if necessary. In such an event there would not be held any elections of any kind. A board of five commissioners was appointed under act of con gress of March 22, 1882, but nothing extraordinary came of it. In conclusion, it is scarcely necessary to say that an intelligent and .well-balanced mind, free from the bias of religion, and regarding the well-being and re finement of the race as most greatly to be desired, cannot look upon polygamy as conducive to the high est culture. On the other hand, it may as truthfully be said that coercion is not consistent with the high est type of morality, and that a social despotism, in the name of freedom and pure republicanism, can become the severest of tyrannies."], [451, "CHAPTER XVI.

Of the twenty-five or thirty thousand latter-day saints gathered in the valley of the Great Salt Lake at the close of the year 1852, less than one third came from Nauvoo; nearly seven thousand proselytes had arrived from various parts of Europe, and the re mainder consisted principally of converts made in the United States.1 As to the number of those who 1 The pioneer hand included, as we have seen, 143 members. Parley Pratt's companies, which arrived in Sept. 1S47, mustered 1,540. In August 1S4S the inhabitants at Salt Lake City were estimated at nearly 1,800, aud there were at this date no other settlements with any considerable population. The emigrants from Winter Quarters during the autumn of this year numbered 2,393, and in 1S49, 1,400. Smaller bands arrived from time to time, but with the close of the latter year the migration from Nauvoo practically came to an end. The number of Mormons from Nauvoo gathered in the valley at this date may be roughly estimated at not more than 8,000, for there were still large numbers scattered throughout the western states. According to the statistics of emigration from Croat Britain and Europe, in Linforlh's Route from Liverpool, 14-15, 2,877 proselytes left the United Kingdom between 1S46 and 1S49. This would make a total of 10.S77. As the reader will remember, the entire population is stated at 11,3S0 in the U. S. Census Rest of 1S50. Add to this number 3,714 emigrants who arrived from Great Britain and Europe between 1S50 and 1S52, as reported in Linforth 's tables, we have a total of 15,094. The remainder were not all converts from the U.

Thus within little more than twenty years the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints had in creased from a handful to an army. And theirs was a new religion, a new revelation, not an ancient faith; they chose for their proselytizing efforts civilized rather than savage fields. In their missionary ad ventures no sect was ever more devoted, more self sacrificing, or more successful. The catholic friars in their new-world excursions were not more indif ferent to life, wealth, health, and comfort, not more indifferent to scorn and insult, not more filled with high courage and lofty enthusiasm, than were the Mormon elders in their old-world enterprises. In all their movements they were circumspect, moderate, studying the idiosyncrasies of the several nations in which they labored, and careful about running un necessarily counter to their prejudices. On reaching the scene of his labors, the missionary earned his daily bread by some trade or handicraft, not even refusing domestic service, in order to provide for his wants, and meanwhile studying the language of the people among whom he lived. Many were cast into dungeons, where they wTere forced to live on bread and water; many travelled en foot from district to district, with no other food than the roots which they dug near the wayside; many journeyed under the rays of a tropical sun, the water trickling from the rocks and the berries hanging from the bushes forming at tunes their only sustenance.2 The term of their labors had no certain limit, de pending entirely on the will of the first presidency. For the more distant missions it was seldom less than two years or more than six. They must remain at 'Remy, Jour, to G. S. L.

Restored at length to their families, they were ready to set forth at a day's notice to new fields of labor; and for all this self-denial they sought no earthly reward, es teeming it as their greatest privilege thus to give proof of their unfailing devotion to the church. One of the first Mormon missions of which we have any record was sent forth in October 1830, in which year, as will be remembered, it was ordered that Pratt, Cowdery, Whitmer, and Peterson should go and preach the gospel to the Lamanites. During their progress they labored for a season among the Wyandots in western Ohio. Thence they journeyed to Cincinnati, but meeting there with little success, proceeded to St Louis, preaching at several points on their way to large congregations. Starting forth westward early in the spring, they travelled for 300 miles through the snow, sometimes knee-deep, their food being corn bread and raw frozen pork. After a journey of 1,500 miles, occupying about four months, they reached Independence, having preached the gospel to thousands of the gentiles, baptizing and confirming many hundreds, and establishing several churches.3 * The Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt, one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, embracing his Life, Ministry, and Travels, with Extracts, in Prose and Verse, from his Miscellaneous Writ ings, Edited by his son Parley P. Pratt, New York, 1S74, is one of the most valuable works extant on the subject of Mormon missions. The author re lates iu simple phrase the hardships, persecutions, and adventures which he and other missionaries encountered in various parts of the United States, and though probably he makes the most of them, there can be little doubt that so far his narrative is iu the main reliable. Chosen a member of the first (mo ram in 1S35, he was on terms of iutimacy with Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and others of the church dignitaries, and as the editor remarks, 'his history, therefore, was so interwoven with that of the church, that many of the most interesting sketches of church history will be found therein.' In the autobiography, which covers a period of twenty years, from his early boyhood to his betrayal into the hands of his enemies, of which more hereafter, is an account of his life and travels, his missionary labors, and the labors of those with whom he was associated, together with some of his miscellaneous writings in prose and verse.

The Fountain of Knowledge is a short essay on the scriptures. Immortality and Eternal Life of the Material Body is an at- tempt to prove the proposition as named. Intelligence and Affection comprises a few jiages on these qualities in man, more particularly in regard to their immortality. The above five pamphlets, besides being published separately, were issued as one pamphlet at Nauvoo. The third son of Jared and Charity Pratt, Parley, was born at Burlington, Otsego CO., N. Y., his ancestors being among the earliest settlers at Hartford, Conn., in 1839, and probably among the party that accompanied Thomas Hooker from Newtown, now Cambridge, Mass., in 1836. Of his conversion to Mormonism I have already spoken, and of the leading incidents in his life and the manner of his death mention is made elsewhere. One of those who set forth from Nauvoo in Feb. 1S46, he was sent from 'Winter Quarters, as will be remembered, during the same year, on a mission to Englaud. But for this circumstance his A ulobiography would probably have included a complete and reliable account of the great Mormon exodus, and one that would have been a most valuable addition to the records of the latter-day saints. Parley was a man of many miracles and visions. In fact, with him all was miraculous; the voice of nature was the voice of God, and in one current ran revelation and human happenings. He was miracu- lously directed in the first instance to the book of Mormon and Joseph Smith. Myriads of false spirits were rebuked by him and driven back into the dark- ness. During an illness he had a dream. ' I thought I saw myself dressed in a clean and beautiful linen robe, white as snow,' on which was written the words 'holy prophet' and 'new Jerusalem.' At the elder's conference in Missouri, February 1832, he was obliged to keep his bed, as he had not yet recovered from his illness. At tho clo\u00bbe of it, he says, ' I requested the ciders to lay their hands on me and pray. They did so. I was instantly healed.' Again, when detained by a severe fever, he whispered to Brother Murdoch to lay bauds on him unobserved while giving him water. ' I drank of it,' he says, ' bounded on my feet, dressed myself, put on my shoes and hat, and told him I was ready to start. ' Still travelling with Murdoch, he was again taken ill, and again miraculously cured. While engaged in fencing and ploughing six acres for wheat, he heard a voice at night saying, ' Parley, Parley! ' 1 an- swered, ' Here am I.' Said the voice, ' Cease splitting rails, for the Lord hath prepared you for a greater work. ' He dreamed one night, during tho troubles in Missouri, of an attack by enemies at a distance, and learned afterward that the vision was true. About to set out from Kirtland on a mission to Canada in April 1S30, being in debt and deeply depressed, his wife sick and childless, Heber C. Kimball and other elders, filled with the spirit of prophecy, en- tered his house late one night and said: ' Brother Parley, thy wife shall be healedfrom this hour, and shall bear a son, and his name'shall be Parley, and he shall be a chosen instrument in the hands of the Lord to inherit the priest- hood, and to walk in the steps of his father.' Instances might be multiplied. Scores of sick women and children in obedience to the command, ' In the name of Jesus Christ, be thou made whole,' arose and walked. 'In 1S31 among the Delawares; in 1S32 in the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri; in 1S33, after the exodus from Independence, in New York; in 1S35 in New England, N.

From July to January we preached, advertised, printed, published,6 testified, visited, talked, prayed, and wept in vain.\" Elijah Fordham was with him, and for several weeks only six proselytes were made, of whom two or three sometimes met in a small upper room in an obscure street. Sorely discouraged, the two elders invited their converts to a last prayer-meeting, intending to set forth for New Orleans. Each prayed in turn, when suddenly the room was filled with the holy spirit, and all began to prophesy and speak in tongues. \"They should tarry in the city and go not thence as yet; for the Lord had many people in that city, and he had now come by the power of his holy spirit to gather them into his fold.\" Among the converts was a chairmaker, named David Rogers, who now fitted up a large chamber at his own expense and invited the elders to preach. The room was crowded at the first meeting, and soon afterward the elders were ministering at fifteen dis ferent places throughout the city, all of which were crowded, sometimes preaching twice a day almost every day in the week, besides visiting from house to house.6 Mention has already been made of the labors of Brigham Young and other missionaries in various 6 ' My first production in that city was a book of upwards of two hun dred pages, entitled the Voice of Warning.

In the year 1833, Orson Pratt was sent as a mis sionary to southern Canada, and 8 about the same date Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon organized a church near Hamilton. In 183G, Parley Pratt, brother to Orson, being then one of the twelve, was sent to Upper Canada9 to preach and establish a church; and from this ministry it was foretold that the gospel should spread into England. With him went Brother Nickerson, who parted company at Hamilton. Left alone, knowing no one, having no money, what should he do? His destination was Toronto; fare by steamer two dollars; it would be a tedious journey on foot He entered his closet and prayed to the Lord, then stepped out upon the street and began chatting with the people. Presently he was accosted by a stranger who asked his name, and whither he was going, and if he did not want money. Parley answered, explain ing his position, whereupon the stranger gave him ten dollars, and a letter of introduction to John Tay lor, a merchant of Toronto, where he arrived the same day.

In the morning he visited the clergymen of the -place, none of whom would open to him their dwellings or places of worship. Then he applied to the sheriff for the use of the court-house, then to the authorities for a public room in the market-place, and with no better result. The prospect was dark, considering the prophecies con cerning this mission. Again and again he tried with no better success. His resources were exhausted; he could do nothing more; he must depart. He retired to a grove just outside the town and prayed. His heart was very heavy. He returned to the house of John Taylor, where he had left his handful of baggage, and bade his friends farewell. Mr Taylor was touched with pity, and held him for a moment in conversation, during which a Mrs Wal ton entered and began talking in an adjoining room with Mrs Taylor, who spoke of Parley's failure, say ing: \"He may be a man of God, and I am sorry to have him depart.\" The visitor was at once deeply interested. \"Indeed,\" she said, \"I feel that it is so, and that I was directed hither by the spirit of the Lord. I am a widow; but I have a spare room and bed, and food in plenty. My son will come and guide him to my house, which shall be his home; and there are two large rooms to preach in.\" Parley gladly accepted the offer. . His labors were thenceforth at tended with success. Mrs Walton soon received bap tism; a friend of hers, a poor widow, was miraculously cured of blindness, and many in consequence believed. There was a Mr Patrick, a wealthy and influential man, whose custom it was every sabbath to hold in his house a meeting, wherein were discussed questions concerning salvation, without regard to doctrine or dogma. Both John Taylor and Mrs Walton were in the habit of attending these meetings, the former fre quently taking a part in the discussions.

At the appointed hour the rooms were filled; at the close of a powerful discourse another meeting was called for, and then another. Taylor became more and more interested ; he once accompanied Par ley into the country where he had promised to preach; at length, with Mrs Taylor, he was baptized. Thus was a shining light brought into the church, a branch of which was now established in Toronto, and was the forerunner of the mission work in Great Brit ain.10 During the year 1837, Heber C. Kimball and Orson Hyde, of the quorum of the twelve, accompanied by Willard Richards, were placed at the head of a mission to England, the members of which were drawn from elders of the church in Canada, and several of whom were English, or had friends in England. The elders chosen were Joseph Fielding, Isaac Russell, John Goodson, and John Snider.11 Taking ship for Liver pool, where they arrived on the 20th of July,12 apos tles Kimball, Hyde, and Willard Richards landed without the means of paying for their first night's lodging; but tho remainder of the party furnishing the funds, all secured apartments in the same dwelling, and two days later took coach for Preston. Here at Vauxhall Chapel, then in charge of the Rev. James Fielding, brother to Elder Fielding, the doctrines of Mormonism were first proclaimed in Great Britain, Kimball giving a brief account of the origin of the church, and of the teachings of the book of Mormon. 10 After ministering at Toronto and its neighborhood for about two months, the apostle announced that he must return to Kirtland, and, as he relates, on the eve of his departure several hundred dollars were placed in his hands, though he had asked no one for money, and none knew that the main reason for returning was to arrange for the payment of his debts.

In April 1840, when was held, at Preston, the first council of the twelve in a foreign land, Brigham Young, who arrived in England during this year,14 be ing elected their president, the church claimed in tbe British Islands nearly 2,000 proselytes,15 in April 1841 more than 6,000,16 and at the close of 1852 more than 32,000. According to a statistical report of the church throughout the United Kingdom for the half-year ending December 31, 1852, there were at that date 742 branches, 17 of the quorum of seventies, 10 high-priests, 1,913 priests, 2,752 elders, 1,44G teachers, and 856 \"Smith, Rise, Progress, and Trove's, 30-1.

Being in feeble health, he was carried to the house of Heber C. Kimball, where he remained until the ISth, when they set forth together. Mrs Mary Ann Young was left with an infant only ten days old, and the youngest child of Mrs Kimball, who was then sick with chills and fever, was only three weeks old. Heber, who was also suffering from ague, relates that when he took leave of his family, it seemed as if his very heart would melt within him. ' This is pretty tough, is it not?' he remarked to Brigham. ' Let us rise up and give them a cheer. ' They arose, and swing ing their hats, cried, 'Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for Israel!' Neither were in condition to travel, and both were almost penniless. Arriving at Kirtland, which place they visited on their way, Brigham had one New York shilling left, and Heber claims that meanwhile the necessary funds had been sup plied by some heavenly messenger. The vessel sailed on the 19th of March, and reached Liverpool on the 0th of April, the tenth anniversary of the organ ization of the church. Brigham left the ship in company with Heber and Parley, and when he landed shouted with a loud voice, 'Hosanna! ' On the next day they went to Preston by rail. Hist. B.

Meanwhile, however, the number of branches had in creased by 100, and during the last half of the year 1852 more than 2,000 members had emigrated. Manchester conference, with its starved factory operatives, heads the list with 3,282 members, and those who have visited any of the great manufactur ing towns of Lancashire, where in winter men, women, and children may be seen hastening from their ill drained hovels through the snow and slush of the dark streets to the cotton-mill, returning exhausted with toil to their supper of bread and tea, will not wonder that these hapless human beings were glad to exchange their hard lot for the plenty of the prom ised land.

In no other town or city does the number amount to one thousand, though most of the shires of England are represented in the list of branches. At this period the British Islands were justly termed the stronghold of Mormonism; and that Mor mon missionaries made in that country a deep and abiding impression is shown by the fact that their 32,000 proselytes, nearly all of them being mechanics, laborers, or factory operatives, expended of their scant earnings nearly one dollar per capita a year for the purchase of Mormon books, periodicals, and insignia.1' 17 During that term 3,400 persons had been baptized, 85 had emigrated, and 234 had died.

Elsewhere no lasting impression has been made. Thus for many years the strong hold of Mormonism was, as we have seen, in England, while in the British colonies, where for the most part food is cheap, labor is in demand at living rates, and the people are somewhat more enlightened than in the mother country, missionaries have met with little encouragement. In Norway, Sweden, and Den mark large numbers of proselytes have also been bap tized; but in central and southern Europe, with the exception perhaps of Switzerland, the results, have been meagre, and accomplished with great effort.

In the atter year, not more than 3,000 persons arrived in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, including converts from the United States; although at this time it was published in American and copied in European papers that proselytes by the hundred thousand were on their way.

His figures are at least 20 per cent too high. The entire population of Utah, for instance, was not more than 60,000 at this date. A writer in the Hist.

There were many, however, who neglected or were unable to pay the advance, the amount due to the funds increasing gradually, until, in 1880, it had reached, with interest, $1,604, 000.

Pre pare against another season to come by tens of thou sands; and think not that your way is going to be opened to come in chariots, feasting on the fat of all lands. We have been willing to live on bread and water, and many times very little bread too, for years, that we might search out and plant the saints in a goodly land. This we have accomplished, through the blessing of our heavenly father; and we now in vite you to a feast of fat things, to a land that will supply all your wants with reasonable labor; there fore let all who can procure a bit of bread, and one garment on their back, be assured there is water plenty and pure by the way, and doubt no longer, but come next year to the place of gathering, and even in flocks, as doves fly to their windows before a storm.\" These words were repeated by hundreds of elders throughout the United Kingdom, and no second invi tation was needed. Men offered themselves by thou sands, begging for passage to the land of the saints, promising to walk the entire way from St Louis to Salt Lake City, and to assist in hauling the provisions and baggage. To meet this demand, it was deter mined to despatch emigrants for the ensuing season at the low rate of \u00a310 sterling per capita for the en tire journey,43 including provisions, and nearly one thousand persons availed themselves of the opportu nity. There were now four classes of emigrants: first, those assisted from the fund by order from Salt Lake City; second, assisted emigrants selected in Great Britain; third, the \u00a310 emigrants; fourth, emi grants who paid all their own expenses and sent for ward money to procure teams.50 The entire outlay 49 Linforth 's Route from Liverpool, 12.

A year or two later it was found necessary to increase the minimum charge from \u00a310 to \u00a313, on account of the greater cost of provisions, wagons, and cattle, caused by the California emigration. Of emigrant travel by sea and land we have inter esting records. Excepting perhaps some parts of Soudan, there were, at this date, few places in the world more difficult to reach than the valley of the Great Salt Lake. After arriving at New Orleans, a journey of more than three thousand miles awaited the emigrants by way of St Louis and Council Bluffs, from which latter point they must proceed in wagons or on foot across the wilderness, travelling in this primitive fashion for three weary months before reach ing their destination. Of all the thousands who set forth on this toilsome pilgrimage, few failed to reach the city of the saints, the loss of life, whether of man or beast, being very much below that which was suf fered by parties bound for the gold-fields of Califor nia. While at sea, every provision was made for their health and comfort, and after reaching Council Bluffs none were allowed to start until their outfit was com- plete and their party fully organized. The Liverpool manager of one of the New Orleans packet lines speaks in the highest terms of his inter course with the Mormons during the year 1850. He states that they were generally intelligent and well behaved, and many of them highly respectable. After mentioning the vocations of the emigrants, he de clares that the precautions taken for the preservation of order, decency, and cleanliness on board were ad mirable, and well worthy of imitation; and that from his observation of the slovenly and dirty habits of other classes of emigrants, it would not only conduce to their comfort and health, but would absolutely save the lives of many if similar regulations were intro duced.61 \u2022 51 Mackay, The Mormons, 270-3.

The dietary was on a scale62 that gave to most of them better fare than that to which they had be fore been accustomed. Many of the vessels chartered for New Orleans were of large tonnage, some of them carrying as many as a thousand passengers. When on board, the brethren were divided into wards, each with its bishop and two councillors, who were implic itly obeyed. The centre of the ship was occupied by married couples, single men being placed in the bow and single women in the stern. Strict discipline was enforced on the voyage.63 Divine service was held each day, morning and evening, when the weather was favorable, and on Sundays an awning was spread over the main deck, and spare spars so arranged as to furnish seats. Among many of the companies were excellent choirs, which rendered the church music; and during the passage there were frequent entertain ments, concerts, and dance-parties, in which the cap tain and officers of the ship participated. After landing, the same organization was maintained.

When the brethren were ready- to set forth for Salt Lake City, they were divided into companies of ten, fifty, and a hundred, and the order of march was the same as that adopted in 1848, during the migration from Nauvoo. For every party of ten, a wagon, two oxen, two milch cows, and a tent were provided. Each wagon was examined by one of the bishops, and none were allowed to start that did not contain the requisite quantity of provisions65 and ammunition. All who were capable of bearing arms were required to carry a rifle or musket.

Among the mem bers of the party were to be found the New England man with his stock of trading goods, the southerner with his colored attendant, the Englishman with his box of mechanic's tools, the Dane, the Swiss, and the Scandinavian with their implements of agriculture. There were few trades and few nationalities not repre sented, and few professions save that of the lawyer. Among the proselytes were university graduates, phy sicians, ministers, army and navy officers, school-mas ters, merchants, storekeepers, and even pawnbrokers. Yet amidst all this heterogeneous gathering, through out all the hardsfiips and privations of the march, there was little strife or discord ; and never did it hap pen, as was often the case with parties bound for the gold-fields, that a Mormon company broke up into fragments through the dissension of its members.67 Those who set forth early in the season \u2014 not later than the middle of June \u2014 seldom met with any seri ous disaster ; and it was recommended that none should leave Council Bluffs' after that time of year, on ac count of the severe snow-storms that sometimes pre vailed in the mountains during autumn. In October 1849, for instance, while crossing Rocky Ridge, near the summit of South Pass, a party in charge of George A. Smith, the prophet's cousin, encountered a storm, in which more than sixty of their cattle per ished. Toward night on the 2d a strong wind set in from the north-east, accompanied with driving snow.

The appearance of this train was good, most of the wagons hav ing from three to five yoke of cattle, and all in fine condition.

The wind freshened into a gale, and then into a hurricane, howl ing incessantly for thirty-six hours, and drifting the snow in every direction. For two nights women and children lay under their frail covering, exposed to the blast, with no food but a morsel of bread or bis cuit. Tents and wagon-tops were blown away, and the wagons buried almost to the tops of their wheels in the snow-drifts. No fires could be lighted; little food could be had; no aid was nigh; and now, in this wintry solitude, though within a few days' march of the valley, the saints expected no other fate than to leave their bodies a prey to the wolve\u00bband the vultures. At length the storm abated, and making their way toward the willow copse, the men found nearly half their cattle lying stiff amid the snow-banks, while others died from the effects of the storm. Not a human life was lost, however, though in this neigh borhood many a grave was passed, some of friends near and dear, some of gold-seekers, whose bodies had been disinterred and half devoured by the wolves, and some of their persecutors in Illinois and Missouri, whose bones lay bleaching in the sun, a head-board with name, age, and date of decease being all that remained to mark their resting-place.68 Until the year 1856 the poorer classes of emigrants were supplied with ox-teams for the overland portion of the trip, the total cost of the journey from Liverpool, including provisions, never exceeding sixty dollars. There were thousands of converts in Europe, however, 68 In a letter dated Muddy Fork \u2014 930 miles from Winter Quarters \u2014 Oct. 18, 1849, and published in the Frontier Guardian, Dec. 26th, of that year, George A. Smith writes : 'Among others we noticed at the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains the grave of one E. Dodd, of Gallatin, Mo., died on the 19th of July last of typhus fever. The wolves had completely disinterred him. The clothes in which he had beeu buried lay strewed around. His under jawbone lay in the grave, with the teeth complete, the only remains discernable of him. It is believed he was the same Dodd that took an active part, and a prominent mobocrat, in the murder of the saints at Haun's Mills, Mo. If so, it is a righteous retribution. '"], [477, "HAND-CART EMIGRATION. 423 who were anxious to be gathered unto Zion, but could not command even this sum, and measures were now considered whereby the expense could be reduced. After much discussion, it was decided that parties should cross the plains with hand-carts, in which they were to carry their baggage, wagons being provided only for tents, extra provisions, and those who were unable to walk. Instructions to this effect were issued from Brigham Young, September 30, 1855, and in a general epistle of the twelve, dated October 29th, a circular being published in Liverpool about four months later by the presidency of the British Isles, in which the rate of passage was fixed at \u00a39 sterling per capita.59 \"The Lord, through his prophet, says of the poor, 'Let them come on foot, with hand-carts or wheelbarrows; let them gird up their loins, and walk through, and nothing shall hinder them.'\" Iowa City was selected as the point of outfit, and there the hand-carts were built. They were of some what primitive fashion, the shafts being about five feet long and of hickory or oak, with cross-pieces, one of them serving for handle, forming the bed of the cart, under the centre of which was a wooden axle-tree, the wheels being also of wood, with a light iron band, and the entire weight of the vehicle about sixty pounds.60 Better carts were provided in subsequent years. When the hand-cart emigrants, about thirteen hun dred in number, set forth from Liverpool, they were assured that everything would be provided for them on their arrival at Iowa City; but on reaching that point many of them were delayed for weeks until the carts were built. Three companies started early in the season and made the journey without mishap.61 The next company, under Captain James G. Willie, 6*The letter, epistle, and circular will be found in the Millennial Star, xvii. 812-15, xviii. 49-55, 121-3. 6U Stenhouse's Rocky Mountain Saints, 314.

Deseret News, Oct. 6, 1S56."], [478, "MISSIONS AND IMMIGRATION. 424 was not in motion until the middle of July, and the last that season, under Captain Edward Martin, not until the end of that month. They were divided, as usual, into hundreds, Willie's company being somewhat below that number; and for each hundred were fur- nished twenty hand-carts, five tents, three or four milch cows, and a wagon with three yoke of oxen to convey the provisions and tents, the quantity of cloth- ing and bedding being limited to seventeen pounds per capita, and the freight of each cart, including cooking utensils, being about one hundred pounds. Willie's company reached Winter Quarters, or Flor- ence, as it was now termed, near the middle of August, and here a meeting was held to decide whether they should continue their journey or encamp for the win- ter. They had yet more than a thousand miles to travel, and with their utmost effort could not expect to arrive in the valley until late in November. The matter was left with the elders, all of whom, except one named Levi Savage, counselled them to go for- ward and trust in the Lord, who would surely protect his people. Savage declared that they should trust also to such common sense as the Lord had given them. From his certain knowledge, the company, containing as it did so large a number of the aged and infirm, of women and children, could not cross the mountains thus late in the season, without much suf- fering, sickness, and death. He was overruled and rebuked for want of faith. \"Brethren and sisters,\" he replied, \"what I have said I know to be true; but seeing you are to go forward, I will go with you. May God in his mercy preserve us.\" The company set forth from Florence on the 18th, and on each hand-cart was now placed a ninety-eight pound sack of flour, as the wagons could not carry the entire load. At first they travelled about fifteen miles a day, although delays were caused by the breaking of wheels and axles, the heat and aridity of the plains and mountain country speedily making many of the cart-wheels rickety, and unable to sustain their"], [479, "EMIGRANTS IN DISTRESS. 425 burdens without frequent repairs. Some shod the axles of their carts with old leather, others with tin from the plates and kettles of their mess outfit; and for grease they used their allowance of bacon, and even their soap, of which they had but little. On reaching Wood River, the cattle stampeded,62 and thirty head were lost, the remainder being only sufficient to allow one yoke to each wagon. The beef cattle, milch cows, and heifers were used as draught animals, but were of little service, and it was found necessary to place an other sack of flour on each hand-cart. The issue of beef was then stopped, the cows gave no milk, and the daily ration was reduced to a pound of flour, with a little rice, sugar, coffee, arid bacon, an allowance which only furnished breakfast for some of the men, who fasted for the remainder of the day. While encamped on the north fork of the Platte, the emigrants were* overtaken by F. D. Richards, W. H. Kimball, G. D. Grant, and a party of elders, return ing from foreign missions, who gave them what en couragement they could. \"Though it might storm on their right and on their left, the Lord would keep open their way before them, and they would reach Zion in safety.\" After camping with them for one night, the elders went on their way, promising to leave provisions for them at Fort Laramie if possible, and to send aid from Salt Lake City. On reaching Lara mie no provisions were found, and rations were again reduced, men able to work receiving twelve ounces of flour daily, women and old men nine ounces, and chil dren from four to eight ounces. As the emigrants travelled along the banks of the Sweetwater, the nights became severe, and their bed coverinar was now insufficient. Before them were the mountains, clad almost to the base with snow, where already the storms of winter were gathering. Grad ually the old and infirm began to droop, and soon deaths became frequent, the companies seldom leaving 62 At this point the country was alive with buffaloes."], [480, "MISSIONS AND IMMIGRATION. 426 their camping-ground without burying one or more of the party. Then able-bodied men began to succumb, a few of them continuing to pull their carts until the day before they died, and one or two even on the day of their death. On the morning when the first snow storm occurred, the last ration of flour was issued, and a march of sixteen miles was before them to the near est camping-ground on the Sweetwater. The task seemed hopeless; but at noon a wagon drove up, con taining Joseph A. Young and Stephen Taylor, from Salt Lake City, who told them that a train of supplies was on the way, and would reach them in a day or two. Young and Taylor immediately went on to meet Martin's company, which it' was feared was even in worse plight than that of Captain Willie. Thus encouraged, the emigrants pushed forward, and by doubling their teams, while the strongest of the party helped the weak to drag along their carts, all reached the camping-ground, though some of the cattle per ished, and during the night five persons died of cold and exhaustion. In the morning the snow was a foot deep; and now there remained only two barrels of biscuit, a few pounds of sugar and dried apples, and a quarter of a sack of rice. Two of the disabled cattle were killed, their carcasses issued for beef, and on this and a small dole of biscuit the emigrants were told that they must subsist until supplies reached them, the small remnant of provisions being reserved for the young children and the sick. It was now decided to remain in camp, while Captain Willie with one of the elders went in search of the supply trains. The small allowance of beef and biscuit was consumed the first day, and on the second day more cattle were killed and eaten without biscuit. On the next day there was nothing to eat, for no more cattle could be spared, and still the sup plies came not, being delayed by the same storm which the emigrants had encountered. During these three"], [481, "STARVATION AND DEATH. 427 days many died and numbers sickened, some expir ing in the arms of those who were themselves almost at the point of death, mothers clasping with their dying clutch the remnants of their tattered clothing around the wan forms of their perishing infants, and, most pitiful sight of all, strong men begging for the morsel of food that had been set apart for the sick and helpless. It was now the evening of the third day, and the sun was sinking behind the snow-clad ranges, which could be traced far to the west amid the clear, frosty atmosphere of the desert. There were many who, while they gazed on this scene, did not expect to see the light of another day, and there were many who cared no longer for life, having lost all that makes life precious. They retired to their tents, and commend ing themselves to their maker, lay down to rest, perchance to die. But presently a shout of joy was raised, as from an eminence near the western portion of the camp covered wagons were seen approaching, with Willie at their head. In charge of the train were Kimball and Grant, who distributed to the com panies about half of their provisions, together with a quantity of warm clothing, blankets, and buffalo-robes, the remainder being sent forward under charge of Grant for the use of Martin's company, while Kim ball now took command of Willie's detachment. But the troubles of the hand-cart emigrants were not yet at an end. Some were already beyond all human aid; some had lost their reason, and around others the blackness of despair had gathered, all efforts to rouse them from their stupor being unavail ing. Each day the weather grew colder, and many were frost-bitten, losing fingers, toes, or ears, one sick man who held on to the wagon-bars, to avoid jolting, having all his fingers frozen. At a camping-ground on Willow Creek, a tributary of the Sweetwater, fifteen corpses were buried, thirteen of them being"], [482, "MISSIONS AND IMMIGRATION. 428 frozen to death. Near South Pass another company of the brethren met them, with supplies from Salt Lake City, and from the trees near their camp several quarters of fat beef were suspended \u2014 \"a picture,\" says (Jhislett, who had charge of one of the companies, \"that far surpassed the paintings of the ancient mas ters.\" From this point warmer weather prevailed, and fresh teams from the valley constantly met them, distributing provisions sufficient for their needs, and then travelling eastward to meet Martin's company. On reaching Salt Lake City on the 9th of Novem ber, it was found that sixty--seven out of a total of four hundred and twenty had died on the journey. Of the six hundred emigrants included in Martin's de tachment, which arrived three weeks later, a small per centage perished, the storm which overtook Willie's party on the Sweetwater reaching them on the North Platte. There they encamped, and waited about ten days for the weather to moderate. Their rations were reduced to four ounces of flour per head per day, for a few days, until relief came. On arriving at Salt Lake, the survivors were received with the utmost kindness, arrangements being made with the bishops of wards to provide for those who had no relatives in the terri tory; and throughout the settlements, wherever it was known that a family had crossed the plains with the hand-cart companies, that alone was sufficient to insure for them substantial aid from the brethren.63 \" My account of the hand-cart emigration is taken principally from Mr Chislett's narrative in Stenhouse's Rocky Mountain Saints, 312-338. The story as told in Stenhouse's Tell It All, 206-36, though it claims to have been written by one of the women of the party, and perhaps was so written, is merely an adaptation of the above. Another version will be found in Young's Wife No. 19, 206-21. For other mention of the hand-cart emigration, see Siskiyou Co. Affairs, MS., 18; Paddock's La Tour, 345; Deseret News, Nov. 12, 19, 30, 1856; S. L. Herald, Jan. 4, 1879; S. F. Alta, Nov. 12, 13, 1S56; S. F. Bul letin, Jan. 12, 1857. In hundreds of newspapers and magazines appeared grossly exaggerated descriptions of this disaster, of which the following, taken from the Or. Statesman, June 15, 1857, may serve as a specimen: ' Of the 2,500 persons who started from the frontier, only about 200 frost-bitten, starving, and emaciated beings lived to tell the tale of their sufferings. The remaining 2,300 perished on the way of hunger, cold, and fatigue.' The emi-"], [483, "THE PARTY AT DEVIL'S GATE. 429 There remains yet one more incident in the story of the hand-cart emigration. On arrival at Devil's Gate on the Sweetwater, twenty men, belonging to Martin's company, were left in charge of stock, merchandise, and baggage, with orders to follow in the spring. The snow fell deep, and many of the cattle were devoured by the wolves, while others per ished from cold. The rest were slaughtered, and on their frozen carcasses the men subsisted, their small stock of flour and salt being now exhausted. Game was scarce in the neighborhood, and with their utmost care the supply of food could not hold out until spring. Two of the men, with the only horses that remained, were sent to Platte Bridge to obtain supplies; but the animals were lost, and they returned empty-handed. Presently the meat was all consumed; and then their only resource was the hides, which were cut into small pieces and soaked in hot water, after the hair had been removed. When the last hides had been eaten, nothing remained but their boot-tops and the scraps of leather around their wagons, even the neck-piece of a buffalo skin which had served as door-mat being used for food. Thus they kept themselves alive until spring, when they subsisted on thistle roots and wild garlic, until at length relief came from Salt Lake City. Even the worst enemies of Brigham Young admit that he was in no sense to blame for this disaster, and that he spared no effort to prevent it. When tidings of the emigrants' condition arrived in Salt Lake City, he at once suspended all other business,64 and declared that nothing more should be done until every avail able team was sent to their relief. He himself set grants were happy and content, until winter overtook them in the mountains, singing as they journeyed, one of their songs commencing: 1 We're going to Zion with our carts, And the spirit of God within our hearts;' the chorus of another, sung to the tune of ' A little more cider:' ' Hurrah for the camp of Tsrael ! Hurrah for the hand-cart scheme I Hurrah 1 Hurrah! 'tis better far Than wagon and ox-team.' \" The October conference was then in session."], [484, "MISSIONS AND IMMIGRATION. 430 the example by sending several of his best teams laden with provisions and clothing, other large sup plies being forwarded by Heber C. Kimball and the more wealthy of the elders. Each one contributed according to his means, those who had no teams fur nishing apparel, bedding, and food, and this at a time when, as will presently appear, the territory was almost in a state of famine, on account of a second plague of grasshoppers. The catastrophe was due mainly to the error in starting so late in the season from Iowa City, and to the fact that the companies did not contain a sufficient number of able-bodied men in proportion to the infirm, the women, and children.65 Moreover, the winter was one of the earliest and most severe that has ever been known in Utah. The hand-cart scheme was perfectly feasible, if carried out under proper management, as was proved by the success of the first companies, and, in the spring of 1857, by a party of seventy-four missionaries, who accomplished the trip to the Missouri in forty-eight days, or less than half the time needed when the journey was made by wagon.66 After the hand-cart disaster, and perhaps partly on account of the reports sent home by the survivors, there was a gradual diminution in the rate of emigra tion, though with many fluctuations. In 1876 only 1,184 proselytes were despatched from Liverpool, this being one of the smallest movements recorded. In 1877 the number increased to 1,479, and in 1878 to 1,864, but in 1879 fell off to 1,456, about 55 per cent of the emigrants for the last of these years being of 66 It was from Iowa City that the late start was made. Stenhouse and others delight in making out something horrible in the hand-cart business, and the leaders no better than the vilest criminals. It was an unfortunate affair, in which the leaders suffered with the rest, but nothing further than this can be justly charged to any one. Rocky Mountain Saints, 341-2.

Between 1850 and 1856 the movement appears to have reached its culmination, proselytes being gathered by the thousand to the promised land, and thousands more preparing to follow. The elders were exhorted to \"thunder the word of the almighty to the saints to arise and come to Zion.\"69 The brethren were commanded to shake from their feet the dust of Baby lon and hasten to the holy city. \"Every saint who does not come home,\" says the sixth general epistle of the twelve,70 \"will be afflicted by the devil.\" \"Every particle of our means that we use in Babylon,\" re marks Elder Erastus Snow,71 \"is a loss to ourselves; and it is so much means expended upon Babylon that shall perish.\" \"O ye poor and oppressed saints!\" writes Elder Samuel Richards, \"and ye rich ones too, in these lands, do not your bosoms burn with the good spirit of God, which fills his saints always with a de sire to congregate together, and become a holy and 67 Millennial Star, xli. 680; Deseret News, Nov. 19, 1879.

Do you not long to gather to your brethren and sisters in the heights of Zion, where sinners cannot dwell? Do you not fondly wish to assemble with the elders of Israel in the sacred resting places of the excellent of the earth, and there inherit the earth and enjoy the bountiful blessings of a mu nificent creator?\" Such sayings, freely circulated among the toiling myriads of Europe, where for twelve and fifteen hours a day men worked for a wage barely sufficient to sup ply their needs, were not without effect. Under such conditions, a new religion, which promised to exchange the penury and drudgery of its converts for plenty and moderate labor, could not fail to receive a hearing. Moreover, the story of the prophet's assassination and of the expulsion from Illinois was yet fresh in the minds of the people. The saints were still looked upon as mar tyrs, and as martyrs who, having boldly launched forth into an untrodden wilderness, had at length established for themselves an abiding-place, and now stretched forth the hand of christian fellowship to the weary and heavy-laden in all the earth. Never since the founding of the sect was their cause held in more es teem; never had they dwelt together in more perfect harmony, less disturbed by outside influences, or less mindful of the events that were transpiring in the great world beyond. The years that had elapsed since their departure from Nauvoo had witnessed the rise and fall of an empire, the crash of a throne, the great revolutions in the world of science and the world of commerce. But, except so far as they seemed to fulfil the predictions of their seer, all these matters concerned them less than did the building of a saw mill or a nail-factory in the land of which their prophet had foretold: \"And they who are in the north countries shall come in remembrance before the Lord, . . . and a highway shall lje made in the midst of the great deep, . . . and in the barren deserts there shall"], [487, "BIOGRAPHY OF JOHN TAYLOR. 433 come forth pools of living water; and the parched ground shall no longer be a thirsty land.\"72 72 Revelation of Joseph Smith, in Docrine and Covenants, 327. Among the Mormon works largely circulated throughout the British Isles and Europe was one published in 1S52, and entitled The Government of God, by John Taylor, one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In a preface by James Linforth, the writer states that it had been the author's intention to superintend the publication of this work, an 8vo volume of 118 pages, in person; but the cares pretaining to his mis sionary labors and literary work, then more urgently needed, prevented him. He therefore, on his departure for Salt Lake City in the spring of 1852, left with Mr Linforth the manuscript, the printing of which was superintended by him. As a dissertation on a general and abstract subject, it probably has not its equal in point of ability within the whole range of Mormon literature. The style is lofty and clear, and every page betokens the great learning of the author. As a student of ancient and modern history, theologian, and moral philosopher, President Taylor is justly entitled to the front rank; while his proficiency in foreign languages and his knowledge of men and of practical affairs rendered his services no less important as manager abroad than as ex ecutive officer at home. I will here begin the biographical notices of the leading men of Utah, and of some of the pioneers, carrying the same along in the notes to the end of the volume as 1 have done in other cases in my historical works. The lives of some have already been fully given; and in regard to some of the others who have not yet finished playing their part in the history of the country, their bio- graphies will be given here but partially, and finished as the work proceeds. First after Joseph Smith and Brigham Young should be mentioned John Taylor, third president of the entire church. A native of Milnthorpe, Eng- land, where he was born in November 1808, Taylor emigrated in 1829 to To- ronto, Canada, to which city his father had removed two years before. Here, joining a methodist society, he searched the scriptures earnestly, and became convinced that the churches had fallen from grace and were corrupt. With prayer aud fasting he besought the Lord that if there were a true church on earth he would send a messenger to him. Shortly afterward he was visited by Parley P. Pratt, to whom he gave but a cool reception, as many evil re- ports concerning Mormonism were then current. But after close scrutiny, he and several of his friends believed and were baptized. In 1838 it was ordered by revelation that he should be appointed an apostle, and after the schism of that year he filled the vacancy in the quorum caused by the apostasy of John Boynton. In 1840 ho arrived in England as a missionary, his labors extend- ing to Ireland and to the Isle of Man, where he was the first to preach the doctrines of Mormonism. While on a visit to Scotland, he corrected the proof-sheets of the book of Mormon, and helped to prepare a hymn-book for the use of converts in the British Islands. He also wrote several pamphlets in reply to charges against the church. Returning to America in 1841, in company with Brigham Young, he proceeded to Nauvoo, where he was se- lected one of a committee to petition congress for a redress of wrongs, and presented the petition. He also purchased and took charge of the Times and Seasons, at the request of the prophet, the last three volumes being published under his direction, and was chosen a member of the city council, a regent of the university, and judge-advocate of the Nauvoo legion. He was firmly at- tached to the prophet, and at Carthage jail, as we have seen, almost lost his life in attempting to save him. After the expulsion he went, with others of the twelve, to Winter Quarters, where he assisted in organizing the Mormon battalion. At this juncture he was again ordered to England, in company with Parley P. Pratt and Orson Hyde, and returning the following spring, ac companied Pratt's companies to Salt Lake City. In October 1849 he was sent as a missionary to France, where he published a monthly paper, styled L' Hist. Utah. 28"], [488, "MISSIONS AND IMMIGRATION. 434 Etoile du Deseret. Before leaving Europe he translated the book of Mormon into the French language, and preached the gospel of the saints at Hamburg where under his direction the same work was translated into German, and where he also published a monthly paper named Zion's Panier. Returning to Salt Lake City in 1852, he was elected, two years afterward, a member ot the legislature, but resigning this office, went as a missionary to New York, where he superintended the affairs of the church in the eastern states, and established a journal, the first number of which appeared Feb. 17, 1855, under the title of The Mormon, the paper being discontinued in 1857, when Taylor was re called at the outbreak of the Utah war. After that date, his labors were mainly confined to the territory, where he was partly engaged in literary work for the church, serving also for a brief term as probate judge of Utah county, and for several terms as a member of the Utah legislature and speaker of the house. In Oct. 1880 he was appointed, as we shall see later, president of the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints. Further details as to his early career will be found in Hist. B. Young, MS. ; Woodruff's Journal, MS. ; Rich ards' Narr., MS., and many other manuscripts and books. George Q. Cannon, a native of Liverpool, England, was trained in the Mor mon faith, his parents having been converted in 1839, when he was twelve years of age, through the preaching of John Taylor, who some time before had mar ried his father's sister. A short time before the assassination of Joseph Smith the family arrived at Nauvoo, where George found employment as a printer in the office of the Times and Seasons and Nauvoo Neighbor. In 1847 he set out for S. L. City with Parley Pratt's companies, and for two years was en gaged in farming, house-building, and other labor incidental to new settle ments. In the autumn of 1849 he went to California in company with Chas C. Rich, and there worked in the gold mines until the summer of 1850, when he was sent on a mission to tbe Sandwich Islands. On arriving at Honolulu he began to study the Hawaiian language, which he mastered in six weeks, and then travelled and preached among the natives, organizing several branches of the church. In 1854 he returned to Salt Lake City, and the following year went as a missionary to California, where he established and edited a news paper called the Western Standard. When news arrived of the Utah war, he again returned to the valley, and during the exodus of 1858 took charge of the press and printing materials of the Deseret News, which were conveyed to Fill more City. In October 1859 he was chosen an apostle to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Parley Pratt, and was afterward appointed president of the European mission. In 1862 he was ordered to Washington to support the claims of Utah to admission as a state, of which more later. After the adjournment of congress he repaired to England, where he labored until August 1864, 13,000 converts being forwarded to Zion during this period. Being then summoned home, he was elected a member of the legislative coun cil, and was for three years private secretary to Brigham Young. In 1867 he became editor and publisher of the Deseret News, which was then a semi weekly paper, and started the Deseret Evening News, which was issued daily, his connection with the latter continuing until the autumn of 1872, when he was chosen delegate to congress. In 1880 Mr Cannon was appointed first councillor to President John Taylor. For further particulars, see authorities before quoted; also Sola's America Revisited, 302; Reno Daily Gazette, Jan. 24, 1882. Joseph F., the son of Hyrum Smith, who with his brother, the prophet, was assassinated at Carthage jail, was born at Far West, Mo., in 1838. After passing his early youth among the vicissitudes attending the expulsion from Nauvoo and the colonization of Utah, he was ordered, when 16 years of age, to proceed as a missionary to the Sandwich Islands, where he labored earnestly and with marked success. ' By the blessing of the almighty,' be writes, ' I acquired the language of the islanders, and commenced my labors, preaching, baptizing, etc., among the natives, in one hundred days after my arrival at Honolulu.' At the beginning of the Utah war he returned to S. L. City and served in the militia up to the time when Johnston's army entered"], [489, "WILFORD WOODRUFF AND WILLARD RICHARDS. 435 the valley. In 1860 he was sent on mission work to England, where he re mained till 1863, being again ordered, the following year, to the Sandwich Islands in company with A. L. Smith, L. Snow, E. T. Benson, and W.'W. Cluff. Returning in 1865, he was soon after elected an apostle and a mem ber of the legislature, in which latter capacity he served until 1872. In 1874 and 1S75 he presided over the British mission, and in 1880 was chosen second councillor to President Taylor. For additional items, see above authorities. Wilford, the third sou of Aphek and Beulah Thompson Woodruff, was born at Farmington (now Avon), Conn., iu March 1807, his ancestors for at least three generations being residents of that neighborhood. In 1832 he was converted to Mormonism, together with his brother Azmon, and soon afterward cast in his lot at Kirtland, where, for a time, he was the guest of Joseph Smith. Two years later he started on a missionary tour in company with an elder named Brown, journeying on foot through southern Missouri, northern Arkansas, and western Tennessee. In 1837 he was appointed a member of the first quorum of the seventies, and iu April of this year, was married to Ph\u0153be W. Carter at the house of Joseph Smith. In 1839 he was chosen an apostle, and soon afterward was sent on a mission to England, where, in a few months, he and his fellow-missionaries baptized more than 1,800 proselytes, their success being so remarkable as to alarm the orthodox clergy, who brought the matter before the notice of parliament. In 1841 he was shipwrecked at Lake Michigan while on his way to Nauvoo, but escaped with his life and reached that city in October. A few weeks before the assassina tion of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, he was again ordered to England as a mis sionary, returning in 1846, when he crossed the plains with the pioneer band. In 1848 we find him once more a missionary, this time in the eastern states, whence he returned to Salt Lake City in 1850, being elected in December of that year a senator for the provisional state of Deseret. After that date be became one of the foremost men in Utah, the church annals being largely compiled from his records. In his public career he is regarded as one of the founders of the territory; his apostolic labors have earned for him among the saints the title of 'Wilford the faithful.'

Among the pioneers was Willard Richards, born at Hopkinton, Middlesex county, Mass., on the 24th of June, 1804. Under the instruction of his parents, Joseph aud Rhoda Riehards, he applied himself during his youth to the study of theology, but could not discern in the doctrines of any cf the sects around him the fulness of truth. In 1835 he obtained a copy of the book of Mormon, and reading it through twice in ten days, became convinced of its divine authenticity. At this date he was practising medicine at Bos ton, but at once resolved to remove to Kirtland, where a year later he was baptized and ordained an elder by his cousin, Brigham Young. Proceed ing on a mission to England, he labored successfully, and in April 1840 was chosen by revelation one of the twelve. Returning to America, he was ap pointed historian and general recorder to the church, which offices he held until his decease in March 1854. He was an intimate friend of the prophet's, and, as will be remembered, was present at his assassination in Carthage jail. Li 1848, after the return of the pioneer band, he was appointed second coun cillor to the president. Ho was also editor of the Deseret News, the official organ of the church, and wrote most of the general epistles of the twelve to the brethren throughout the world. After the organization of the state of Deseret he was made secretary of state, and afterward presided over the council of the legislative assembly. The last occasion on which he left his house was for the purpose of addressing the council at the close of its session. 'I will go and perform this duty, ' he said, ' if, like John Quincy Adams, I die in the attempt; but no one knows the aggravated extent of my bodily malady. Death stares me in the face, waiting for his prey.

Franklin Dewey Richards, nephew to Willard, was born at Richmond, Berkshire co., Mass., on April 2, 1821. After receiving a common-school education, he was employed at farm labor, or at his father's trade \u2014 that of carpenter. His attention was first called to Mormonism during a visit of Brigham to the house of his grandfather, Joseph Richards. On the 3d of June, 1838, he relates that after being baptized and anointed with oil, he was cured, by the efficacy of prayer, of a severe sickness. In October following, he set forth for Far West, but finding that Gen. Clark had issued an order requiring all Mormous to leave the state, he went to St Louis, where he found employment. In the spring of 1840 he attended a conference at Nauvoo, and was soon after ward sent as a missionary to Indiana, where he established a church. After some further missionary work in the United States, he repaired to Nauvoo where he married, and by great self-denial obtained the means of building a brick house in the eastern part of the city. This he sold before the expulsion for two yoke of oxen and an old wagon. In the spring of 1844 he was ordered with several others to proceed on a mission to England, but after reaching New York he heard of the assassination of the prophet, and returned to Nauvoo. In 1845 he assisted at the completion of the temple, working as a carpenter and painter. When the first bands of the saints crossed the Mis sissippi in Feb. 1856, Mr Richards accompanied them as far as their camping ground on Sugar Creek, where he bade adieu to his wife and family, and soon afterward sailed for Liverpool in company with Parley P. Pratt and others. Of further incidents in his life, I shall have occasion to speak elsewhere. Heber Chase Kimball was a native of Sheldon, Vt, where he was born in 1801. When ten years of age his family removed to West Bloomfield, N. Y., in which town he afterward worked as a blacksmith in his father's shop. In 1820, his father having lost his property, he was compelled to seek his own livelihood, and after suffering much hardship, found employment with his brother, who was a potter by trade, and removed with him to Mendon. He was converted to Mormonism by the preaching of Phineas H. Young, and in 1S32 was baptized, and soon afterward ordained an elder. In Sept. of this year he went to Kirtland with Brigham and Joseph Young, and there met the prophet. In 1835 he was chosen a member of the first quorum of the twelve, and from that date until the expulsion from Nauvoo his time was mainly spent in mis sionary labors in the eastern states and in England. Returning from Salt Lake City to Winter Quarters with the main body of the pioneers, he was appointed first councillor to the president, which office he held until his decease, in June 1868. On the organization of the state of Deseret, he was elected lieutenant-governor and chief justice, and later became president of the coun cil of the legislative assembly. A man of singular generosity, integrity, aud purity of heart, there are few whose names are held in more esteem among the latter-day saints than that of President Kimball. In March 1850 occurred the decease of Oliver Cowdery, at Richmond, Ray co., Mo. His connection with the church from its earliest days, and the part which he took in the translation of the book of Mormon, have already been mentioned. He was cut off, as we have seen, in 1838, but in 1848 was rebap tized. 'His relation of events,' remarks S. W. Richards, 'was of no ordinary character, maintaining unequivocally all those written testimonies he had fur nished to the church in earlier days. Moroni, Peter, James, and John, and other heavenly messengers who had ministered to him in connection with the prophet, Joseph Smith, were familiarly but sacredly spoken of.' After his second conversion he devoted the brief remainder of his life entirely to the cause of the church, declaring his willingness to go forth among the nations and bear testimony of that which had been revealed to him \u2014 a testimony which none but he could bear.

Until the year 1849 the Mormons were entirely under the control of their ecclesiastical leaders, regard ing the presidency not only as their spiritual head, but as the source of law in temporal matters. Disputes were settled by the bishops, or, as they were also termed, magistrates of wards, appointed by the presi dency. The brotherhood discountenanced litigation, as before mentioned, but the population did not con sist entirely of members of the church. There was already in their midst a small percentage of gentile citizens, gathered, as we have seen, from nearly all the civilized nations of the earth. It was probable that, as the resources of the territory were devel oped, this number would increase in greater ratio, and it was not to be expected that they would always re main content without some form of civil government. Not infrequently litigation arose among the gentiles, or between Mormon and gentile; and though strict justice may have been done by the bishops, it was"], [494, "UTAH AS A TERRITORY. 440 difficult for the latter to believe that such was the case. When the loser appealed to the presidency,1 their judgment always confirmed the decision of the bishops, and hence was further ground for dissatisfaction. The saints regarded their courts as divinely commissioned and inspired tribunals; but not so the gentiles, by whom reports were freely circulated of what they termed the lawless oppression of the Mormons. Thus it became advisable to establish for the benefit of all some judicial authority that could not be questioned by any, whether members of the church or not, and this authority must be one that, being recognized by the government of the United States, would have the support of its laws and the shield of its protection. Further than this, if the Mormons neglected to es tablish such government, the incoming gentiles would do so erelong. Early in 1849, therefore, a convention was sum moned of '\"the inhabitants of that portion of Upper California lying east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains,\" and on the 4th of March assembled at Salt Lake City. A committee2 was appointed to draught a constitution, under which the people might govern themselves until congress should otherwise provide by law. A few days later the constitution was adopted, and a provisional government organized, under the name of the State of Deseret.8 An immense tract of country was claimed, extending from latitude 33\u00b0 to the border of Oregon, and from the Rocky Mountains to the Sierra Nevada, together with a section of the territory now included in southern California, and the strip of lThe president desired no litigation among his people.

As no ses sion of the assembly had yet been held, the judiciary was also elected by the people, Heber C. Kimball being chosen chief justice, and John Taylor and Newell K. Whitney associate judges.11 The general assembly was first convened on the 2d of July, and on the 3d Willard Snow, being appointed speaker of the house of representatives, administered the oath or affirmation to the executive officials. Thus did the brethren establish, in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, the state of Deseret. It was certainly a novel and somewhat bold experiment on the part of the saints, mustering then little more than one sixth of the number required for admission as a state, thus to constitute themselves a sovereign and independent people, with a vast extent of territory, and calmly await the action of congress in the matter. It will be remembered that they themselves had lent their aid, in howsoever slight degree, in wresting a portion of this territory from Mexico, and they did not claim more than they believed that they could in time sub due and occupy.

Nor was their assurance unfounded; for, as we have seen, not less than fifteen thousand arrived in the valley before the close of 1852, and were con tent to remain there, believing that they had found better prospects than were to be had even in the gold fields of California, which lay but a few weeks' journey bevond. The Mormons did not, however, hope to remain an independent republic, nor did they probably wish to do so. Well they knew that the tide of westward bound migration, soon to be increased by the estab lishing of a stage line and possibly by the building of a railroad, which, as we shall see later, was already projected, would sorely disturb the peace of their moun tain home unless their claims were recognized by the United States.

Fears are expressed that, through the failure to pro vide civil jurisdiction, political aspirants may subject the government to great loss of blood and treasure in extending its authority over this portion of the national domain. The memorial declares that, for their own security, and for the preservation of the rights of the United States, the people of the state of Deseret have organized a provisional government, under which the civil policy of the nation is duly main tained;13 also that there is now a sufficient number of individuals to support a state government, and that they have erected at their own expense a hall of legis lature which will bear comparison with those in the older states. \"Your memorialists therefore ask your honorable body to favorably consider their interests; and if consistent with the constitution and usages of the federal government, that the constitution accom panying this memorial be ratified, and that the state of Deseret be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with other states, or to such other form of civil government as your wisdom and magnanimity may award to the people of Deseret; and upon the adoption of any form of government here, that their delegate be received, and their interests properly and faithfully represented in the congress of the United States.\"14 13 Then follow two clauses in the preamble in which are mentioned the natural barriers between the state of Deseret and other portions of the Union, and the importance of meting out the boundaries of states and territories in such a manner that the heads of departments may be able to communicate with all parts of the U.

When congress adjourned on the 4th of March, 1849, all that had been done toward establishing some form of government for the immense domain acquired by the treaty with Mexico was to extend over it the revenue laws, and to 'make San Francisco a port of entry. Thus 'Upper California,' as the entire region was still termed, had at this time the same political status as was held by Alaska between 1867 and 1884, at which latter date the national legislature placed that terri tory within pale of the law. It is worthy of note, also, that, in September 1849, the people of California, incensed by the dilatory action of congress, followed the example of the Mormons by framing a constitution of their own. On the 6th of that month, by order of President Taylor, General John Wilson, then United States Indian agent, held a consultation with Brigham Young, Heber C. Kim ball, Willard Richards, and others, with a view to the temporary amalgamation of the states of California and Deseret, in order to -avoid possible difficulties on the slavery question. It was agreed that a memorial should be drawn up, asking for a convention of all the people of Upper California, both east and west of the Sierra Nevada, for the purpose of consolidating the two states in one that should include all the territory acquired from Mexico. At the beginning of 1851 the union was to be dissolved, each state retaining its own constitution, and the people being allowed to deter mine for themselves to which they would belong.

Some of the emigrant parties arrived at Salt Lake City with no effects save their jaded cattle, their wagons, and a scant outfit, while others brought with them val uable merchandise, for which they hoped to find a mar ket in the mining camps. When they made a division of their property, as frequently happened on arriving in the valley, difficulties arose among them, and the discontented parties applied for redress to the courts of Deseret. In these instances there is sufficient evi- dence that impartial justice was rendered,17 and what ever the decision, appeal to a higher court was useless, for the judgment was invariably confirmed. If the losing party rebelled, or expressed in unseemly lan guage his opinion of Mormon justice, he was severely fined, or sometimes imprisoned for a term long enougb to teach him respect for the civil law.

For this a fine was imposed, and the injured party must be fully recompensed. Protests were often made and the case taken before the bishops, but the only result was that the costs were added to the original demand. From the ruling of the bishop, who acted somewhat in the ca pacity of county court judge} an appeal was sometimes made to the bench of bishops; but seldom to any pur pose. A final appeal could be made, however, to Brig ham, who administered practical justice in patriarchal fashion, and whose; opinion of the bishops was the re verse of flattering. \" They are not fit to decide a case between two old women, let alone two men,\" he re marked on one occasion, while at the same time he threatened to dismiss the entire bench if they did not improve. The organization of a civil government was intended mainly for the better control of the gentiles,18 since, to its own members, the authority of the church sufficed. The judicial system of the saints was founded on the doctrines of the book of Mormon rather than on common law, and later, as we shall see, became obnoxious to federal judges and lawyers, none of whom succeeded in making much impression on the pockets of the community. For other reasons the Mormon code was distasteful, especially so far as it related to women. To marry out of the church was an offence. Those who had been sealed were advised not to cast in their lot with the gentiles;13 any one found guilty of seducing a Mormon's wife must surely be put to death.20 18 Although we read in Doctrine and Covenants, 332, ' We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same.

The people were instructed by their spiritual law-givers whom to elect as law-makers in matters temporal, and these were always the dignitaries of the church. Vote by ballot obtained, indeed, in name, but there was practically no freedom of election, and there were seldom even opposing candidates, the strife between political parties, as republican and democrat, being something unknown among them. It is this that the gentiles find fault with; though the Mormons boasted, they say, and still boast of this feature in their polity, as showing the harmony which prevails in their midst, it is in fact tyranny, and tyranny of the worst kind \u2014 an oligarchy with the form but without any of the spirit of republican institutions. Here we have one of the worst phases of Mormonism. It must be remem bered, however, that a great majority of the Mormons were foreigners or of foreign extraction, most of them being men who had never enjoyed political rights, and therefore did not miss them in the land of their adoption. In the proceedings of the general assembly of the state of Deseret there is little worthy of record, and that little relates mainly to municipal affairs, and the establishment of courts of justice, no expense being incurred for this or other branches of government.21 During the winter of 1849-50 a portion of the terri tory was divided into counties, which were named Salt Lake, Weber, Utah, San Pete, Tooele, and Juab.22 To these were added, in 1850, Iron county; in 1851, Mil- woman, during the husband's absence, the judge declared: 'The principle, the only one that beats and throbs through the heart of the entire inhabitants of this territory, is simply this: The man who seduces his neighbor's wife must die, and her nearest relative must kill him.'

Finally, on the 7th of September, 1850, on which date the celebrated compromise measures became law and were supposed to have settled forever the slavery question, a bill passed the senate for the admission of California as a state, without slavery, while the self constituted state of Deseret, shorn somewhat of its proportions, was reduced to the condition of New Mexico, under the name of the Territory of Utah, with a proviso that, \"when admitted as a state, the said territory, or any portion of the same, shall be received into the Union, with or without slavery, as their con stitution may prescribe at the time of their admission.\" Two days later, both bills passed the house of repre sentatives, and afterward received the president's sig nature. It is worthy of remark that the final discus sion on the bill for the admission of Utah turned entirely on the question of allowing slavery in that territory, for throughout the magnificent domain ac quired from Mexico, the only chance now remaining to the south was in the desert portion of the great basin, which, as Senator Seddon of Virginia remarked, \"had been abandoned to the Mormons for its worth lessness.\" The act to establish a territorial government for but kept them in continual danger. ' If you tell us, as some of your predeces sors told our martyred prophets while they were yet alive, that you have no power to redress our wrongs, then there is presented to the world the melan choly spectacle of the greatest republic on earth, a christian nation, acknowl edging itself powerless to judge; unable to protect tho right; a nation on whose righteousness half the earth rest the hopes of man, confessing that there is a power above the law.'

On the north, Oregon was to remain as the boundary, and on the east the Rocky Mountains. The remaining provisions of the organic act differ but little from those framed for other terri tories, for New Mexico, admitted at the same date as was Utah, or for Nevada, admitted in 1861. Thus the Mormons were shut in between the mountain walls of the great basin, the strip of coast which was claimed under the constitution of the state of Deseret, and would have included the port of San Diego, being denied to them. It is probable that, if they could have foreseen all the results of the war with Mexico, the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and the gold discovery, which now threatened to place them almost in the centre of the United States, and not, as they had intended, in a remote and untravelled solitude, they would have selected the site of their new Zion elsewhere than in the valley of the Great Salt Lake.

The territorial form of government was accepted only as a temporary measure, applications being made to congress for ad mission as a state, at intervals, as we shall see later, until 1882. Meanwhile, for many years, the shadow of a state government was preserved, the members of the ideal state assembly, after each session, reenact ing and sanctioning by vote and in due form the laws which they had previously passed as a territorial legislature. On the 1st of July a proclamation was issued by the governor, ordering that an election for members of the assembly and for a delegate to congress be held throughout the territory on the first Monday in Au gust. On July 21st three Indian agencies were estab lished,34 an agent and two sub-agents, of whom the lat ter had already arrived, and were now assigned to their districts, having been appointed by the government.

B. D. Harris of Vermont was chosen secretary ; Joseph Buffington of Pennsyl vania, chief justice; Perry E. Brocchus of Alabama and Zerubbabel Snow of Ohio, associate judges; Seth M. Blair of Deseret, United States attorney; and Joseph L. Heywood of Deseret, United States mar shal. As Buffington declined to serve, Lemuel H. Brandebury was selected to fill his 'place.37 Snow, Heywood, and Blair being Mormons, the government patronage was thus fairly distributed between saints and gentiles. Although these appointments were made on the 20th of September, 1850, none of the gen tile officials arrived in Salt Lake City until the fol lowing summer, and all were not assembled until the first week in August. With them came Almon W. Babbitt, who was intrusted with the sum of \u00a720,000 appropriated by congress toward the building of a state-house. Harris also brought with him $24,000 for the expenses of the legislature. The authorities were kindly received by the saints ; and had they been men of ability and discretion, con tent to discharge their duty without interfering with the social and religious peculiarities of the people, all would have been well; but such was not their charac ter or policy. Judge Brocchus especially was a vain and ambitious man, full of self-importance, fond of in trigue, corrupt, revengeful, hypocritical.

During his re marks he drifted into the subject of polygamy, direct ing this part of his discourse to the women, whom he exhorted to a life of virtue.33 He also took to task some of the Mormon leaders, who on a previous occa sion had spoken disrespectfully of the government, one of them having gone so far as to consign the late President Zachary Taylor to the nether regions. The Mormons were sorely exasperated, and but that they were held in restraint by Brigham, would have done violence to the judge. \"If,\" said the for mer, \"I had but crooked my little finger, he would have been used up; but I did not bend it. If I had, the sisters alone felt indignant enough to have chopped him in pieces.\"39 The governor contented himself with rebuking the judge, who, he declared, must be either profoundly ignorant or perversely wicked. It had become a matter of history throughout the en lightened world, he declared, that the government of the United States regarded the persecution of the saints with indifference, and by their silence gave sanction to such proceedings. Hundreds of women and children had in consequence gone to their graves prematurely, and their blood cried to heaven against those who had caused or consented to their death. Nevertheless, he loved the government and the con stitution of the United States; but he did not love corrupt ministers of the governmei... He was indig nant that such men as Brocchus should come there to lecture the people on morality and virtue, and should make such insinuations as he had done ; and he repeated the statement that Zachary Taylor was then in to phet.

A few days later Brigham invited the judge to at tend a meeting, to be held on the 19th, and explain or apologize for his conduct. The latter declared that he had neither apology nor explanation to make ; that he did not intend any insult, especially to the women, but that his remarks were deliberate and premeditated, and that his purpose was to vindicate the government. Then followed a lengthy reply from the governor, in which Brocchus was severely handled, the judge and his colleagues being thereafter condemned to social ostracism. Soon afterward it was reported to Brigham that the secretary, together with Brocchus and the chief justice, intended to return to Washington, whereupon the governor called on them to ascertain if this was so. He was assured that such was their purpose, and that the secretary would also take with him the funds placed in his hands, and the seal, records, and docu ments pertaining to his office. The governor consid ered this course illegal, and immediately issued a proclamation declaring the result of the election,40 and ordering the assembly to convene on the 22d of September, only four days later.*1 On the 24th a ,0 The members of the council were Heber C.

Thus it will be seen there were 13 members of the council and 25 representatives. In tbe organic act it was provided that there should be 26 representatives, the number of members for either house being based on the census of 1850. George Brimhall, the remain ing member for Iron co., was elected Nov. 15, 1851. \" This proceeding did not conflict with the organic act, which provides \u2014 section iv. \u2014 that the first election shall be held and the members elected shall"], [513, "DISPUTES WITH THE FEDERAL OFFICIALS. 459 resolution was passed, enjoining the United States marshal to take into his custody all the government funds and other public property in possession of the secretary.*2 This resolution was presented to Harris, together with an order for $500 to defray the inciden tal expenses of the assembly. The secretary ignored the resolution and refused to pay the order, under the plea that the members were not legally elected. Among the grounds on which the secretary declared the election illegal was, that before the votes were cast the governor had failed to take a census of the territory, as provided in the organic act; this the lat ter attributed to the miscarriage of instructions and blanks, which had not even yet arrived.\" On the other hand, it was clearly the duty of the secretary, as stated in that act, to remain in the territory during his tenure of office. Moreover, the judges organized and held a session of the supreme court before any time or place was appointed for such session by the executive or legislative authorities, and apparently for the pur pose of shielding the secretary. On the 26th Brigham addressed a letter to the court, asking their opinion as to his duty with reference to the organic act, which required that the governor should take care that the laws were faithfully executed, and that the secretary should reside within the territory. No answer was returned; and after the district attorney had been meet at such places and on such day as the governor shall appoint, but that thereafter the time, place, and manner of conducting elections, and the day for the opening of the regular sessions, shall be prescribed by law. \"Hist.

The successors to the runaway officials were Laza rus H. Reid of New York, who was appointed chief justice; Leonidas Shaver, who succeeded Brocchus; and as secretary, Benjamin G. Ferris. The new officials enjoyed but a brief tenure of office. After remaining in Utah for about a year, Reid returned to New York, where he died in 1855.46 Shaver re tiring to rest one night, soon after his arrival, was found dead in his room next morning, thereby giving rise to an unfounded rumor that he had been poisoned on account of a supposed difficulty with the governor.47 Secretary Ferris, after a six months' residence, pro toward the government than the people of Utah, that they revere the consti tution, seek to honor tho laws, and complain only of their non-execution, and the abuse of power at the hands of those intrusted with them.

Of these, Stiles and Babbitt were Mor mons, though the former was not in harmony with the priesthood, and, as we shall see, Kinney and Drummond play a prominent part in the history of the saints.

In the preceding year congress had also been peti tioned to provide for the construction of a telegraph line from some convenient point on the Mississippi or Missouri to a suitable port on the Pacific. As early as April 1849 Captain Howard Stansbury, of the topographical engineers, had been ordered to Fort Leavenworth, for the purpose of making a sur vey of the Great Salt Lake and an exploration of its valley, with a view to the construction of a transcon tinental railroad. Among his party was Lieutenant J. W. Gunnison, who was placed in charge of the astronomical department.

At first Brigham demurred. He was sur- prised, he said, that the valley should be thus invaded so soon after the Mormons had established their set- tlements; he had heard of the expedition since its departure from Fort Leavenworth, and the entire com- munity was anxious to know what was the purpose of the government. Moreover, an attache of General Wilson, the newly appointed Indian agent for Cali- fornia, whose train had passed through the city a few days before, had boasted that the general was author- ized to expel the Mormons from the territory. They supposed, therefore, that the arrival of the two parties was a concerted movement, and that Stansbury was sent for the purpose of dividing the land into town- ships and sections, and of establishing thereto the claims of government. Upon all these subjects Brig- ham was undeceived, and, the true object of the expe- dition being explained, he laid the matter before the council. Stansbury was then informed that the au- thorities were well pleased with the proposed explora- tion, that they had themselves contemplated such a measure, but could not yet afford the expense, and that they would cheerfully render all the assistance in their power.63 After exploring a route to Fort Hall, and making a reconnoissance of Cache Valley and the western shore of the lake, Stansbury and his men returned to Salt Lake City, and there passed the winter of 1849-50. During this winter Lieutenant Gunnison gathered most of the material for his well-known book on the Mormons, one of the most valuable and impartial works yet published by a gentile writer.64 \"Slansbury's Exped. to Valley of G.

Lake, and of the explorations mentioned above. Travelling, as he did, during the early days of the gold-fever, his narrative is full of interest. Leaving the valley of Warm Spring Branch near Fort Laramie on July 19, 1849, he writes: 'We passed to-day the nearly consumed fragments of about a dozen wagons that had been broken up and burned by their owners; and near them was piled up in one heap from six to eight hundred weight of bacon, thrown away for want of means to transport it farther. Boxes, bonnets, trunks, wagon wheels, whole wagon-bodies, cooking utensils, and in fact ahnost every ar ticle of household furniture, were found from place to place along the prairie, abandoned for the same reason. ' Two days later he found the road strewn with immense quantities of white beans, which seemed to have been thrown out of the wagons by the sackful, their owners being tired of carrying them farther, or afraid to eat them from danger of cholera. Crossing a spur of the Red Buttes on the 27th, he says: 'To-day we find additional and melan choly evidence of the difficulties encountered by those who are ahead of us. ...Bar iron aud steel, large blacksmith's anvils and bellows, crowbars, drills, augers, gold-washers, chisels, axes, lead, trunks, spades, ploughs, large grindstones, baking-ovens, cooking-stoves without number, kegs, barrels, harness, clothing, bacon, and beans were found along the road iu pretty much the order in which they have been here enumerated.' In the seventh chapter is a description of the settlements and industrial condition of the Mormons in the winter of 1349-50, together with some excellent remarks ou the polity of the state of Deseret. In the remainder of the volume we have an account of various explorations and adventures in the valley and on the return jour ney. In the appendices are tables of distances, papers on zoology, botany, geology, and paleontology, meteorological observations, and chemical analyses of mineral waters. The work is well written, sketchy and entertaining in style, and impartial in its comments on the Mormons.

Among other works covering about the same period as Lieut Gunnison's book, may be mentioned the following: The Mormons, or Latter-day Saints; with memoirs of the Life and Death of Joseph Smith, the A merican Mahomet. Edited by Charles Mackay. Fourth edition, London, 1856. The first edition of this work was published in 1851. It claims to have been, as indeed it was, the first work upon the subject which could justly be entitled a histori cal statement of the case. It is a work full of valuable information, much of it of an original character and nowhere else existing. It is written with marked ability, and in a spirit of exceeding fairness, though taking decidedly an anti-Mormon view. Yet the author says: ' It presents the history of Joseph Smith, a great impostor or a great visionary, perhaps both, but in either case one of the most remarkable persons who has appeared on the stage of the world in modern times.' In the fourth edition, 'the whole of the doctrinal chapter, which formed the conclusion of the work in the previous editions, has been excluded in the present instance to make room for matter of a more historical character. Polygamy, which the Mormons attempted to deny, or explain by the euphemism of the spiritual-wife doctrine, has now been un blushingly avowed; and this practice, which has become the most distinctive, as it is the most odious, characteristic of the sect, has received more notice in this edition than was bestowed upon it in the original publication.'

Smucker. New York, 1860. What it is that Mr Smucker edits, and to what he makes additions, does not appear, but the student with this book and that of Mackay's before him soon discovers that the former is taken almost verbatim from the latter, and without a word of credit. Smucker evidently worked at so much a day for the publishers, who desired something by that name to sell. Considering the circumstances, the work is fairly done; the saints are abused with moderation and decorum, and the publishers probably made money out of it. Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism. Biography of its Founders and History of its Church. Personal Remembrances and historical collections hitherto unwritten. By Pomeroy Tucker. Palmyra, N. Y., 1867. This author claims a personal acquaintance with Joseph Smith and the Smith family since their arrival at Palmyra, the birthplace of the writer, in 1816. He also knew Mar tin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and others of the first converts. He was editori ally connected with the Wayne Sentinel when the book of Mormon was printed in the office of that journal. His book is published for the purpose of proving Joseph Smith an impostor and the book of Mormon a fraud. The author has ability, and is accustomed to writing; he has done his work well. He em- Eloys with no small skill and success that most powerful of weapons in the and of a ready writer \u2014 sarcasm. Much space is devoted to sustaining the Spaulding theory. Historically, the book is of little value after the departure of the Mormons from the vicinity of the writer's home; but up to that point, and not forgetting that it is the plea of an advocate rather than the decision of \u00bb judge, it may be called a first-class authority."], [521, "ROUTE RECOMMENDED BY STANSBURY. 467 thousand square miles.65 He then resolved to search out on his return journey some practicable route to the southward of South Pass, though a part of it lay through the territory where Sioux, Blackfoot, Snake, and Utah were used to meet in conflict. Dis posing of his wagons and spare instruments to the Mormons, by whom he was furnished with a sufficient escort, he bade them a kindly farewell, and returned by way of Bridger's and Cheyenne passes to Fort Leavenworth. The route recommended by Stansbury for the portion of a transcontinental railroad between the Missouri, near Independence, and Salt Lake City was by way of the Republican fork and the south fork of the Platte; thence by way of Lodge Pole Creek, and skirting the southern extremity of the Black Hills to the Laramie Plains; thence crossing the north fork of the Platte to South Pass; thence by way of Bear River Valley to Fort Bridger; from that point by way of Black Fork and turning the Uintah Range to the Kamas prairie, whence the route to the capital lay through the valley of the Timpanogos.68 In 1853 Gunnison, who had now been promoted to the rank of captain, was ordered to survey a route farther to the south, by way of the Huerfano River and the pass of Coochetopa; thence through the val leys of the Grand and Green rivers; thence to the vegas de Santa Clara and the Nicollet River; thence northward on a return route to Lake Utah, from which point he was to explore the most available M Stansbury's field-work is thus summarized : 1 .

The party included Lieutenant E. G. Beck with, R. H. Kern as topographer and artist, Sheppard Homans astronomer, Dr James Schiel surgeon and geologist, F. Creutzfeldt botanist, J. A. Snyder as sistant topographer, a number of employe's, and an escort of mounted riflemen in charge of Captain R. M. Morris. On the 24th of October the party was encamped on the Sevier River, fifteen or eighteen miles from the point where it discharges into the l^ke of that name, and on the following day Gunnison started out to explore the lake, accompanied by Kern, Creutzfeldt, the guide, and a corporal with six men of the escort, the remainder of the party, under Captain Morris, proceeding up the river in a north-easterly direction. The following day several men of Morris' detachment were sent to ascertain whether a route were practicable northward from that point to Great Salt Lake. While the men were yet within a hundred yards of camp, the corporal came running toward them, breathless and exhausted, and sinking to the ground, gasped out a few broken sentences, the purport of which was that Gunnison and his party had been mas sacred by Indians, and that, as far as he knew, he was the only survivor. Morris at once ordered his men to arm and mount, and within half an hour was on his way to the scene of the disaster; meanwhile a second member of Gunnison's escort reached camp on horse back, and two other survivors came in later. Gunnison had encamped, with no thought of dan ger, in a sheltered nook under the river bank, where wood and pasture were abundant. He was aware that a large band of Pah Utes was in the neighborhood, and their camp-fires had been seen daily since enter ing the valley of the Sevier. A recent quarrel with an emigrant band had resulted in the killing of one of the natives and the wounding of two others, but they had made no raids on the Mormon settlements, and peace had recently been confirmed at a parley held"], [523, "THE GUNNISON MASSACRE. 469 with some of them by an agent of Brigham. At daybreak all arose and prepared for their day's work, but while seated quietly at breakfast the men were startled by a volley of rifles, a flight of arrows, and the yells of a band of Pah Utes, who had crept, under cover of the bushes, to within twenty-five yards of the spot. The surprise was complete. In vain Gun nison, running forth from his tent, called out to them that he was their friend. He fell, pierced by fifteen arrows, and of the rest only four escaped, after being pursued for several hours by the Indians.67 Situ of the Gunnison Massacre. When Captain Morris reached the scene of the massacre no bodies were found. There was hope, therefore, that others were still alive, and a signal-fire was lighted to assure them of safety ; but all the night long no response was heard, nor any sound save the howling of wolves. Still the men remained at their post, though not more in number than the party that had been massacred. At daylight the corpses were discovered, and though none were scalped, they were mutilated with all the atrocity common to the most savage tribes. Some of them, among whom was that of Captain Gunnison, had their arms hacked off at the 57 One of the survivors was thrown from his horse into a bush, where he lay for several hours, the Indians passing him on every side.

It is related that Gunnison's heart was cut out while he was yet alive, and that it was so full of blood that it bounded on the ground. By many the Gunnison massacre has been and is still ascribed to the agency of the Mormons; and it has even been asserted that Mormons, disguised as Indians, were among those who committed the deed. Here we have a fair specimen of the hundreds of defam atory stories which have been told about the Mormons from the beginning. In this instance not only is there no valid proof against them, but there are many cir cumstances pointing in the opposite direction,63 one of them being that among the slain was a Mormon guide. The Gunnison massacre was brought on by gentiles; it was the direct result of the killing of the Pah Ute by California emigrants. As no compensa tion had been made to his tribe, they avenged them selves, as was their custom, on the first Americans \u2014 for thus they termed all white men, other than Mor mons \u2014 whom they found in their territory.69 The 68 A full account of Gunnison's survey, prepared mainly by himself, and of the massacre will be found in Beckwith's Reports, in Id., ii. Lieut Beckwith writes: 'The statement which has from time to time appeared or been copied in various newspapers of the country, since the occurrence of these sad events, charging the Mormons or Mormon authorities with instigating the Indians to, if not actually aiding them in, the murder of Captain Gunnison and his asso ciates is, I believe, not only entirely false, but there is no accidental circum stance connected with it affording the slightest foundation for such a charge.' Captain Morris, in his official report to the adjutant-general, says nothing about the Mormons being implicated in the matter. See House Ex. Doc, 33d Cong. 1st Sess., no. 18, pp. 5-6. The names of those who were killed, besides Captain Gunnison, were R. H. Kern, F.

Herald, May 7, 1855. 68 On hearing of the massacre, Brigham took measures for the recovery of the property and the disposal of the bodies. Gunnison was somewhat of a favorite among the Mormons. In the Deseret News of Nov. 12, 1853, where is a copy of Beckwith's report of the massacre, is the following: 'We feel to commiserate deeply with the friends of those who have been so sudd 3nly and unexpectedly cut off, but more especially with the wife aud children of Cap tain Gunnison, who was endeared to us by a former and fondly cherished acquaintanceship in 1S49-50, while he was engaged with Captain Howard Stansbury in the survey of the Great Salt and Utah lakes.' The following is"], [525, "MORMON POLICY TOWARD INDIANS. 471 survey of which Gunnison was placed in charge was completed by Beckwith and the other survivors of the party, who reached Salt Lake City by way of Nephi, Payson, and Provo. The Mormon maxim with regard to the Indians was that it was cheaper to feed than to fight them. Hence their intercourse with the Utes and Sho shones 60 was generally peaceable.61 They taught them a sworn statement from the private journal of Anson Call, a Mormon residing in Fillmore City in 1853, and in 1883 one of the most prominent citizens of East Bountiful, Davis co. : ' From Fillmore to the site of the Gunnison mas sacre is about 35 miles. The settlements were in a state of alarm on account of the \"Walker war,\" and just before the massacre a party of emigrants from Missouri, on their way to California, came to Fillmore. During their Btay they made many threats concerning the Indians, and declared repeatedly that they would kill the first one who came into their camp. I remonstrated with them and cautioned them. After this party had left, I learned that some Ind ians around had gone into their camp, and that they had killed two of them and wounded three others. This so enraged the Indians that nothing short of blood would appease their wrath. At this time Capt. Gunnison and his ex ploring party came along. I told him what had happened, and spoke of the exasperation of the Indians. He expressed deep regret, and remarked: \"The Indians are sure to take their revenge. \" ' Then follows an account of the mas sacre, and of the burial of the dead. Call states that Captain Gunnison's re mains were interred at Fillmore. At Lieut Beckwith's request he furnished men for an express to Brigham with news of the massacre. Utah Co. Sketches, MS., 163-8. Call's statement is confirmed by Wells in his Narr., MS., 15-19. Wells states that Capt. Gunnison's brother at first believed the report that the Mormons were implicated, and met Call by appointment at S. L. City. The latter produced his diary, from which he read extracts, and after a full investigation, declared himself satisfied that the Mormons had nothing to do with the massacre. F. D. Richards says that he and Erastus Snow rescued four of the survivors near Cedar Springs. Hist. Incidents of Utah, MS. , 42-3. 60 Although the Indian tribes of Utah were at this period very numer ous, the word 'Utahs' was commonly applied to those south of G. S. Lake, and ' Shoshones ' or ' Snakes ' to those north and y. est of the lake, especially in the valley of the Humboldt River. The Snakes and Utahs were both Sho ehone tribes. See my Native Races, i. passim. \"Richards' Narr., MS., 47; Wells' Narr., MS., 13; Young's Early Expe riences, MS., 5-6. In the latter MS. it is related that when the pioneers en tered the valley Indians were very numerous, but that the only trouble which occurred in early times was with a lame and vicious savage whom the Mor mons named 'the old cripple.' One day this man entered Mrs Young's cabin during her husband's absence, and asked for some biscuits. She gave him all that she could spare, and when he demanded more replied that she had none. The Indian then strung his bow and threatened to shoot her. ' Wait a mo ment/said Mrs Young, 'and I will bring more biscuits. ' Stepping into an adjoining shed, she let loose at him a huge mastiff, which seized him by the leg, causing him to howl with pain. The savage now gave up his arrows, whereupon his wound was dressed and he was sent about his business. He was never seen again in that neighborhood. This incident is also related in Tullidge's Women of Morm., 442.

Never theless, when the tide of gentile emigration set in for California, outbreaks among the Indians were of fre quent occurrence. The troubles caused to the early settlers in the Utah Valley in 1849-50 have already been mentioned. In the autumn of the latter year, a disturbance occurred in the northern part of the ter ritory, caused by a party of emigrants, who, while en camped on the Malade River, shot two Shoshone women as they were crossing the stream on horseback, stole their horses, and then set forth on their journey. Thereupon the warriors of the tribe began to commit depredations on the northern settlements, slaying a Mormon named Campbell, who was engaged in build ing a saw-mill, near Ogden, and threatening to massa cre the inhabitants of that village. General Eldredge of the Nauvoo legion, being sent with a detachment to the scene of action, found that the Shoshones had moved northward, carrying off a number of horses band, and encamped near the present site of Main Street, S. L. City. Dur ing my visit to Utah, in August 1S84, he described to me the cabin that he built soon after his arrival near the spot where the ' Beehive ' later stood. Its roof was of dirt, and its flooring of planks, sawn by his own hands. This was the first house built in the city, and as it had glass for windows, was long considered one of the most comfortable. Around this residence locust trees were planted, but only those were saved which were covered with buckets. At the time of my visit I found Mr Young living at his country home, within two or three miles of the capital, in company with the eldest of his three wives, Harriet Page Wheeler Young, a native of Hillsborough, N. H., who was baptized into the faith in Feb. 1836, and was married to Lo renzo at Nauvoo in 1844, a few weeks before the assassination of Joseph Smith. The house was long and narrow, plainly built and furnished, indicating no sur plus of this world's goods. Mrs Harriet Young is the heroine of the story re lated above. In a double brick house near by lived the other wives of Mr Young. They were honest, good-natured, credulous people, and were thor oughly contented with their lot. Their simple needs were all supplied; their barn was filled with hay, and the yard well stocked with poultry. All the wives addressed Lorenzo as 'father,' and the entire party seemed to form one patriarchal family, living quietly, happily, and in accordance with their faith. At this date Mr Young was 77 years of age; he was a man of medium height, ruddy, and cheerful of countenance, with kindly blue eyes, thin, white, curly locks, and except for a slight deafness, showed little trace of age. He said that on his 75th birthday he counted 122 living descendants, but had Bince lost track of the number of his grandchildren. He expressed a wish that the doc trine of polygamy should be studied in the light of the old testament, and the facts laid bare by some honest and impartial inquirer."], [527, "THE CHIEF WALKER. 473 and cattle. A number of Utahs were on the ground, and a portion of them were made prisoners and retained as hostages, the tribe being advised to move south to their usual place of abode and avoid all further in tercourse with the Shoshones. Thus the matter was settled without further bloodshed.63 No serious outbreaks occurred among the Indian tribes during 1851-2, though emigrant parties, both Mormon and gentile, were sometimes molested,63 and in October of the former year, the mail for California was captured within a few days after leaving Salt Lake City.64 During 1853 and a portion of the following year occurred what was known as the Walker war, in which the Mormons suffered serious loss of life and property throughout their territory. Walker, a fa vorite chief of the Utahs, was at this time a man in the prime of life, one versed in all manly exercises, an excellent shot, and a capital judge of horse-flesh. In addition to several of the native dialects, he could eon verse fluently in Spanish, and make himself understood in English. Long before the advent of the Mormons he made frequent raids into the Mexican states, where he laid the people under contribution, and took cap tive persons of rank and condition whom he held to ransom. When setting forth on one of these forays he was attired in a suit of the finest broadcloth, cut 02 Deseret News, Sept. 21, 1850; Smith's Rise, Progress and Travels, 28.

In the morning, when ready to start, 200 or 300 Indians made their appearance, and pressed so closely on the mail- wagon that the men were forced to abandon it and retreat, some on mules and some on foot, keeping up a fight with the Indians for several miles. At least five of the assailants were killed. S. F. Alta, Nov. 2, 1851.

Over this costume he wore his gaudy Indian trappings, and as he rode at the head of his braves, with their gayly accoutred steeds and em broidered saddles glittering with metal ornaments, he might have been taken for a Soldan among the dusky Painims of the west.66 At first Walker received the exiled saints with open arms, gave them information as to the nature of the country, advised them where to establish set tlements, and guarded them from depredation. But when he saw that they had occupied his choicest lands; when game disappeared from the canons and moun tain sides; and when his people were shot down with out provocation, and their cattle stolen by bands of emigrants, his friendship turned to hate, and he longed to rid himself of the white man. On the 17th of July, 1853, hostilities broke out, and continued with little interruption until winter. During this year twelve Mormons were killed and a number wounded ; about four hundred cattle and horses were stolen, and the expense incurred in building forts and remov ing settlements amounted to $200,000.68 That the loss was not still greater was due to the vigilance of 65 Richards and others state that even after the gold discovery Walker made raids into California, and that on one occasion, about the year 1849, the people turned out en masse to capture him and his band in their lurking place among the mountains. The chief quietly secured their horses and trappings at dead of night and returned with them to Utah. Utah Notes, MS., 8. Wells, Narr., MS., 17, says that Walker did not inherit the chief tainship, but obtained it through the success of his raids into California. When an Indian possessed cattle and horses enough to mount and feed others, he was at once regarded as a big man among the Utahs, and thus Walker obtained his prestige. Ora, now dead, was the head chief of the Ute nation, and Uintah was a great chief among the Utahs. 66Governor's message, in Utah, Jour. Legist, 1853-4, 121-2. On July 17th the Utahs made a raid on Springville, but, the inhabitants being forewarned, no damage was done. On the 18th Alexander Keele, who was on sentry near Payson, was shot dead by Arapeen, Walker's brother. The Indians then moved up Peteetneet Canon, firing on the settlers as they passed. On the 19th Col Conover started from Provo with 150 men to assist the smaller set tlements. On the same day the savages attempted to surprise the settlement at Pleasant Creek, and stole horses and cattle at Manti and Nephi. On the 20th the guard at Nephi was fired upon.

Among the causes that led to disturbance with the Utahs was the presence of trading parties from New Mexico, who supplied the Indians with horses, fire arms, and ammunition, often taking in exchange Indian women and children, who were afterward sold into slavery.67 To remedy this evil, an act was passed by the Utah legislature in 1852, legalizing the enforced apprenticeship of Indian children, but only for the purpose of inducing the brethren to purchase those who would otherwise have been sold to the Mexicans or abandoned by their parents.68 So frequent were which encountered a band of 20 or 30 Indians near Pleasant Creek, and killed six of them.

Calhoon, superintendent of Indian affairs, was shown to Willard Richards, who states that on the 3d of that month Leon, with 20 Mexicans, was at Manti, for the purpose of trading horses for Indian children, and that two other companies were about to follow. Wells, Narr., MS., 23, and Richards, Hist. Incidents of Utah, MS., 25-6, state that the Utahs were in the habit of stealing children from the Piutes and selling them to Mexican traders. The latter relates that Arapeen had a stolen child who was taken sick, and as the savage could not sell it, he took it by the heels, swung it round his head, and dashed out its brains. The act was witnessed by several Mormons, who were only prevented from shooting him on the spot through fear of provoking a general uprising. By virtue of his authority as governor and superintendent of Indian affairs, Brigham Young forbade all trading of this nature, and told the Mexicans that their license was not valid. Hist. B. Young, MS., 1851, 115. 68 In the preamble it is stated that the purchase of Indian women and chil dren by Mexican traders has been carried on from time immemorial; that it is a common practice with Indians to gamble away their women and children; that the captives thus obtained, or obtained by war or theft, were often car ried from place to place, packed on horses or mules, lariated out to subsist on grass or roots, bound with thongs of rawhide, until their feet and hands were"], [530, "476 UTAH AS A TERRITORY. the visits of the slave-traders, that in April 1853 a proclamation was issued by the governor, ordering the arrest of all strolling parties of Mexicans, and forbid ding any Mexican to leave the territory until further advised*.69 Between 1854 and 1856 troubles with the Indians were less frequent,70 and these were mainly with the swollen; and when they fell sick, were frequently slain by their masters. It was therefore enacted that whenever any white person within the territory should have in his possession an Indian prisoner, whether by purchase or otherwise, he should immediately take his captive before the probate judge or one of the selectmen, and if in their opinion the applicant was a sit person to retain and educate him, he was to be bound by indenture for a term not ex- ceeding 20 years, during which he must be decently clad at the owner's ex- pense, aud attend school for three months in each year.

In a message to the legislature, dated Jan. 6, 1852, Brigham, reviewing at length the internal policy of the terri- tory, said that the system of slavery was obnoxious to humanity, but that the negro should serve the seed of Abraham, and not be a ruler nor vote for men to rule over him. ' My own feelings are, that no property can or should be recognized as existing in slaves, either Indian or African.' Utah, Jour. Legist, 1S51-2, pp. 108-10. Nevertheless, a few years later, there were slaves in Utah. Horace Greeley, during an interview with Brigham, in 1S59, asked him, ' What is the position of your church in regard to slavery?' ' YVe con- sider it,' he answered, ' of divine institution.' 'Are any slaves now held in this territory?' 'There are.' 'Do your territorial laws uphold slavery?'

During this trip Brigham met the chief Walker at Chicken Creek, made a truce with him, and gave him presents. Walker afterward became very friendly to the Mormons. During the negotiations Walker said, through an interpreter, that Brigham was a great chief, and that he was himself as great \u2014 holding up both thumbs to indicate that both were equally great.

Arriving at the outskirts of the camp, Grattan sent for The Bear, who said that his people had determined not to deliver up the accused; whereupon the lieutenaut resolved to enter the camp and arrest him at all hazards. Thus far the statements of witnesses agree, but from this point there is a conflict of testimony. It can only be stated with certainty that a fight ensued, in which the lieutenant and his entire command were killed. The whole matter wears the appearance of a well planned attempt on the part of the Indians to gain possession of Fort Laramie, and of the warehouses of a trading company near by, where the Sioux were awaiting the arrival of the Indian agent to distribute their annuity goods. In the latter attempt they' were successful. Various reports of the massacre will be found in House Ex. Doc, 33d Cong. 2d Sess., viii. no. 63. See also Rept of Sec. of Inter., in Id., i. pt i. 224-5.

In Thousand Spring Valley we saw but one, and had to chase him on horseback before we came up with him.

For the five years ending the 30th of June, 1855, the sum paid to the Mormons for losses incurred through Indian depredations, for the expense of suppressing Indian outbreaks, and of negotiating treaties, amounting probably to not less than $300, 000 was $95,940.65; and, small as it was, when drafts were presented at the treasury, excuses were found for not paying them.''7 The occupation of territory under such conditions was of course resented by the original owners of the soil, and it is no matter for surprise that the small detachments of United States troops lost more in number between the years 1853 and 1856 than did the Mormons.78 The saints seldom used their rifles 76 Ind.

If their population was not yet large enough to en title them to admission, it was larger than that of several of the younger states when first admitted.9 They were a prosperous and fairly intelligent com munity; their wars with the Indian tribes had been conducted successfully, and at their own expense; at their own expense also they had constructed public buildings, roads, and bridges; they had conquered the desert, and amid its wastes had founded cities; there could be no doubt of their ability to maintain a state government ; and thus far, at least, there was no valid reason to question their loyalty.

The peace commissioners sent to the territory in 185S, after the Utah war, reported its population at the figures given by Richards. The census of 1860 was taken under some disadvantages. Gen. Burr was appointed to that duty by Marshal Dotson, a strong anti-Mormon, but as the saints murmured at this selection, a clerk in his store was chosen iu his stead. The returns gave 40,295 souls, including 29 apprentices, or so-called slaves, and aro probably much within the actual figures. At this date the Mormons claimed a popu lation of 90,000 to 100,000, which is doubtless an exaggeration. In order to show the number that would entitle them to admission as a state, they were accused of counting cattle and unborn children as souls. Burton's City of the Saints. 356-8. It is probable that the actual population in 1860 was about 65,000. 10 For comments on the admission of Utah as a state at this period, see"], [539, "LAND TITLES AND NATIONAL AID. 485 Another cause of complaint with the Mormons was the impossibility of acquiring a secure title to land. In December 1853 the president of the United States had recommended in his message that the land system be extended over Utah,11 with such modifications as the peculiarities of that territory might require. About a year later, an act was passed authorizing the ap pointment of a surveyor-general for Utah,12 and soon afterward large tracts were surveyed. But the In dian title had not yet been extinguished ; the sections were not open to preemption, and the saints therefore found themselves merely in the condition of squatters in their land of Zion. They were ready to purchase, but the organic act forbade the primary disposal of the soil, and, as it seems, the government, knowing their ability and their eagerness to purchase, still hes itated to make them its permanent owners. Never theless, a few years before, this portion of the public domain had virtually been ceded to them as worth less. Still another reason for dissatisfaction was the fail ure of congress to make such appropriations as were granted for other territories. With the exception of about $9G,000 granted, it will be remembered, as part compensation for an expense of $300,000 in quelling Indian outbreaks, $20,000 for a state-house, and $5,000 for a library, no money was voted specially for the benefit of Utah between 1850 and 1857; for the sums expended on the survey and construction of roads connecting that territory with other parts of the Union cannot, of course, be so regarded.

Besides the powers pertaining to such courts, they had the administration of estates, the guardianship of minors, idiots, and insane persons, and \"power to exercise original jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, and as well in chancery as at common law, when not prohibited by legislative enactment.\"15 The probate court judges were, of course, Mormons; but appeal lay from their decisions to the district courts. Subject to the revision of the probate courts were the municipal courts, the justices of the peace, and the three 'selectmen' appointed for each county, whose duties were to oversee and provide for the mainte nance of the poor, to take charge of the persons and estates of the insane, and to bind apprentice, orphan, and vagrant children.16 Thus the probate courts, whose proper jurisdiction concerned only the estates of the dead, were made judges of the living, with powers almost equal to those of the supreme and district courts. These powers were conferred on them, as the gentiles alleged, in order to nullify, so far as possible, the authority of 15 Utah, Acts Legist (ed. 1855), 120-1, 123-4. Section 8 of this act, relat ing to pleadings, is worthy of note, as it shows the tendency of the Mormons to simplify their system of legal procedure. 'Any pleading which possesses the following requisites shall be deemed sufficient: First, when to the com mon understanding it conveys a reasonable certainty of meaning. Second, when by a fair and natural construction it shows a substantial cause of action or defence. If defective in the former, the court shall direct a more specific statement. If in the latter, it is ground for demurrer; demurrers for formal defects are abolished.' 16 An act creating the office of selectmen, and defining their duties, approved Feb. 5, 1852, will be found iu Utah, Acts Legist (ed. 1855), 136-7."], [542, "THE GOVERNMENT IN ARMS. 488 the higher courts; and as the Mormons alleged, be cause justice could not be had at the hands of the federal officials, who were little with them and at such uncertain times that, save for the probate^ courts, they would have been practically without civil and criminal jurisdiction. To the malevolent representa tions of the latter the saints mainly ascribed the Mor mon war, and, as will presently appear, the violation of some of their most cherished rights and privileges.

And now trouble commenced. The legislature had appointed a territorial marshal, who was to take the place of the United States marshal, impanel jurors, and enforce writs when the courts were sitting as territorial courts; while the United States marshal claimed the right to officiate in all the United States courts, whether they were sitting as territorial or fed eral courts. To the latter, the judge issued certain writs, which it was found impossible to serve, and when the question of jurisdiction was brought be fore the court, several Mormon lawyers entered and 17 According to the provisions of 'an act concerning the judiciary and for judicial purposes,' approved Oct. 4, 1851.

A short time afterward the records of the United States district courts were taken from the judge's office during his absence, and a few mo ments before his return a bonfire was made of the books and papers in his office. He, of course, sup posed that the records were also consumed, and so made affidavit on his return to Washington in the spring of 1857. Meanwhile the business of the courts was suspended. The records had, in fact, been re moved, and were in safe-keeping; but this silly freak was noised abroad throughout the land with many exaggerations, and excited much adverse comment. The chief justice was a more popular magistrate than either of his colleagues. In Iowa, where he resided before receiving his appointment, he was bet ter known as a tradesman than as a jurist, and on account of his traffic with the saints at Kanesville was called a jack Mormon. On his arrival at Salt Lake City he added to his judicial functions the occu pations of store-keeper and boarding-house proprietor. He never lost the good-will of his patrons, and never refused to drink with them. Rotund, of viuous aspect, and of medium height, dull-witted, brusque in manner, and pompous in mien, he was a man whom Brigham knew well how to use; before taking leave of the Mormons he became an open apologist for polygamy.

Two of them, as we have seen, deserted their post, a third was probably an opium eater, a fourth a drunkard, a fifth a gambler and a lecher.

Eight of the offenders, in cluding a chief named Kanosh, were put on trial at Nephi City; and though the judge distinctly charged the jury that they must find the prisoners guilty or not guilty of murder, a verdict of manslaughter was returned against three of the accused, the rest being acquitted.

I know what I think I shall say : if they play the same game again, so help me God, we will slay them.\"28 Such phrase, deliberately uttered at the place and on the day of public worship, at a time when Utah sought admission as a state, was certainly, from an outside standpoint, injudicious, and boded ill for the saints. At this period the slavery question was the all-absorbing topic throughout the country. The se dition in Utah, grave though it was, passed for a time almost unheeded, except by a section of the republican party, which, while criticising the theories of Senator Douglas, added to the venom of its sting b}7 coupling slavery and polygamy as the twin relics of barbarism. After the presidential election of 1856, however, mat ters assumed a different phase. There was now a temporary lull in the storm which a few years later swept with all the fury of a tornado over the fairest portions of the Union, and the nation had leisure to turn its attention to the Mormon question.29 27 Judge Drummond, in his letter to Mrs Gunnison, in Gunnison's The Mor mons, ix.-x., says that those who were convicted were old, crippled, and par tially blind, while the able-bodied warriors were acquitted, and that Judge Kinney, before whom the trial took place, was so much mortified at the find ing of the jury that he at once adjourned the court. He also states that Col Steptoe, Gen. Holman, the government attorney, Garland Hurt, Indian agent, and others were of opinion that those who were found not guilty were acquit ted by order of the church. The statement as to the escape of the three who were convicted rests mainly on the authority of Capt. Rufus Ingalls, the quar termaster of Col Steptoe's regiment. In his report to the quartermaster-gen eral, in House Ex.

With the advice of his cabinet, therefore, and yielding perhaps not unwill ingly to the outcry of the republican party, President Buchanan determined that Brigham should be super seded as governor, and that a force should be sent to the territory, ostensibly as a posse comitatus, to sustain the authority of his successor.80 tion to Joseph Smith, Dec. 25, 1832, and first published by F. D. Richards in the Pearl of Great Price at Liverpool in 1851.

The days will come that war will be poured out upon all nations, beginning at that place; for behold! the southern states shall be divided against the northern states, and the southern states will call on other nations, even on the nation of Great Britain, as it is called, and they shall also call upon other nations, in order to defend themselves against other nations; and thus war 6hall be poured out upon all nations. And it shall come to pass after many days slaves shall rise up against their masters, who shall be marshalled and disciplined for war.' It is somewhat suspicious that this revelation should appear in the edition of 1876, but not iu the one of 1845, or in any other edi tion published before the war, so far as I am aware. A copy of it will be found in Stenhouse's Rocky Mountain Saints, 420-1. According to Hist. B. Young, MS.; Carrington's Rem., MS., Joseph Smith early in his career warned the saints that 'some day they would see the United States come against them in war, and that the Lord should deliver them.' 80 The above appear to be the main reasons that led to what was termed the Utah war. Among the best statements as to its causes, apart from the official documents already quoted, are those contained in Remy's Journey to G. S. L. City, i. 408-73, and Tullidge's Hist. S. L. City, 144 et seq., though the latter is somewhat far-fetched and lays too much stress on the part that Fremont bore in the matter. 'In the framing of its first platform,' he says the republican party raised her (Utah) to a kindred association with the south; and in every campaign where John C. Fremont was the-standard bearer of the party, there could be read: 'The abolishment of slavery and polygamy, the twin relics of barbarism.' Mr Tullidge borrows somewhat closely from Stenhouse, who, in his Rocky Mountain Saints, 307-8, makes the same remark. The causes of the war have, of course, been touched upon by most writers on Utah, those in favor of the saints claiming that there was no just reason for it, and others bringing numberless charges against them. Dur ing the years 1855-7 newspapers and periodicals throughout the U. S. were teeming with articles and paragraphs on the Mormon question, most of them being more or less acrid and unjust in their comments. A writer in the Atlantic Monthly, March 1859, p. 364, states that Buchanan's idea in order ing the Utah expedition was 'to gag the north, and induce her to forget that she had been robbed of her birthright, by forcing on the attention of the country other questions of absorbing interest.'

Except that the internal government of the saints was nominally theocratic and practically autocratic, these statements are grossly unjust, but not more so than might be expected from a biased and ill-informed official, who was not even aware that the population of Utah con tained a considerable percentage of gentiles. When first the Mormons peopled their desert land they had raised with due respect the Union flag, and as citizens of the nation had, in the name of the nation, claimed the territory as the nation's right; but now, on the 24th of July, 1857, while celebrating the tenth anni versary of the arrival of the pioneers, they were to hear for the first time of the approach of a United States army, and, as they supposed, were to be driven out of their homes at the point of the bayonet.

The general's decision was strongly against the despatch of an army until the following season, on account of the distance and the time required for the concentra tion of regiments. It would have been well if his ad vice had been taken, but other counsels prevailed, and about the end of May orders were given that a force, consisting of the 5th and 10th infantry, the 2d dra goons, and a battery of the 4th artillery, should assem ble as soon as possible at Fort Leavenworth.31 Sev eral reinforcements were sent forward during the year, and in June 1858 there were more than six thousand troops in Utah, or en route for that territory.32 The command was given to Brigadier-general Harney, a man of much rude force of character, ambitious, and a capable officer, but otherwise ill fitted for the conduct of an expedition that needed the qualities of a diplo matist more than those of a soldier.

Through a little dexterous manipu lation at Washington, permission was given to the man who secured the flour contract to furnish Utah flour, and this he did at a cost of seven cents per pound, receiving, of course, meanwhile, the money al lowed for freight, and netting in a single year the sum of $170,000.34 The troops remained in the territory for about four years, and no wonder that they often asked one of another, \"Why were we sent here? Why are we kept here?

Neither the famine nor the bountiful harvest which followed ap pear, however, to have been known to the authorities at Washington. The winter of 1856-7 had been un usually severe. For six months the territory had been shut out from the remainder of the world, no mails having reached the eastern states. To add to their distress, the Mormons were compelled to feed large multitudes of emigrants, who arrived at this pe riod in a starving condition in the hand-cart com panies. At the time when the expedition was ordered, there were thousands in the territory who, for more than a year, had not had a full meal; there were thou sands of children who had endured the gnawings of hunger until hunger had become to them a second na ture. Yet in the orders to Harney, issued while yet the famine was at its sorest, we read: \"It is not doubted that a surplus of provisions and forage, be yond the wants of the resident population, will be found in the valley of Utah, and that the inhabitants, if assured by energy and justice, will be ready to sell them to the troops. Hence, no instructions are given you for the extreme event of the troops being in ab solute need of such supplies, and their being withheld by the inhabitants. The necessities of such an occa sion would furnish a law for your guidance.\"3.

For months some families knew not the taste of bread, and settlements in which good crops had been gathered in former years were compelled to send their teams several hundred miles for bran and shorts.

Detachments were not to be lightly hazarded, but a small, though sufficient, force was to move separately in charge of the more cumbersome part of the convoy, and in advance of the rest, until overtaken by the main body, when it was to form the rear-guard. Thus no precautions were omitted that might serve to insure the success of the expedition, and it was hoped that its purpose might be attained without the loss of a single life. Meanwhile, events of some importance had tran spired at Washington. The governorship of Utah, after being refused by several persons, was accepted in July by Alfred Cumming, who had recently been superintendent of Indian affairs on the upper Mis souri, in which capacity he had displayed tact and ex ecutive ability. About the same time D. R. Eckles was appointed chief justice, and John Cradlebaugh and Charles E. Sinclair, associate judges.

It is improbable that Brigham would take such risks, for, as we shall see, he now proposed to establish an express company in connection with the mails. 8* During the winter of 1856-7 no regular mail service was performed, on account of the severity of the season. The postmaster at S. L. City contracted, however, with Messrs Little and Hanks to carry a mail to Independence for SI, 500. They made the trip in 78 days, having suffered severely from cold and hunger. Little's Mail Service, MS., 35-8. Mr Little had been for several years connected with the mail service. In 1850 Sam. H. Woodson of Inde- pendence, Mo. , made a contract with the U. S. P. 0. department to carry a monthly mail for four years between that point and S. L. City. This was the first government mail service performed between S. L. City and any point east of the Rocky Mountains. Mr Little afterward contracted with Woodson to carry the mail between S. L. City and Fort Laramie, where the mails exchanged, commencing the service Aug. 1, 1851, and associating with himself Ephraim K. Hanks and Charles F. Decker. At that time there was no settlement be- tween S. L. City and Fort Laramie, except the trading post at Fort Bridger. On their first trip Little and Hanks met Secretary Harris and judges Brocchus and Brandebury between Green River and South Pass. They reached Laramie in nine days, without changing their animals, aud there procured five unbroken Mexican mules, with which they completed their journey. In Sept. 1851 C. F. Decker and Alfred Higgins set out in charge of a mail, Delegate Bern- hisel being a passenger. At Box Elder Creek their party was stopped by 20 Indians, who plundered the wagon. On Oct. 1, 1851, Mr Little started on a second trip eastward, among his passengers being Judge Brandebury, aud among his fellow-travellers Judge Brocchus. Mr Little's third trip was made in Nov. and Dec. 1852, Howard Livingstone, of the firm of Livingstone & Kin- kead, being one of his passengers. In Feb. 1852and May 1853 Mr Decker carried the mails to Laramie, having a narrow escape from death at the hands of hos- tile Indians on his second trip, on which occasion he met with Kit Carson, to whose intercession he ascribes his deliverance. Another trip was made by Mr Little in April 1853. Id., 1-34; Utah Early Records, MS., passim. Foi further particulars on mail routes and sendees up to 1856, see U. S.

This despatch was probably the actual reason that led to the withdrawal of the mail contract, and cer tainly among the reasons that led to the Utah war; for in answer to a resolution asking for details as to the cause of the expedition, the secretary of state re ported that the only document on record or on file in his department was the letter of Mr Magraw to the president.41 The annual payment on account of Hiram Kimball's contract amounted only to $23,600 a year, a sum barely sufficient to defray expenses ; but such a favor, small as it was, had never before been conferred on a Mormon citizen. Brigham resolved, therefore, that all diligence should be used in keeping faith with the gov ernment, and for his own benefit established in con nection with the mail service the B. Y. Express Carrying Company. In the early spring of 1857 the snow was still deep on plain and mountain, and to build stations and provide draught animals, and forage for the entire distance of more than twelve hundred miles was no easy task.

Be tween Fort Laramie and Fort Kearny he encoun tered the advanced guard of the army of Utah, and, as he relates, was informed by the commanding officer that the troops \" were reconnoitring the country in search of hostile Indians.\" When about a hundred miles west of Independence freight teams were met, destined, as the drivers said, for some western post, but for what particular post they did not know. On reaching Kansas City, Smoot repaired with one Nich olas Groesbeck, who took charge of the mails at that point, to the office of William H. Russell, and there \"Stenhouse's Rocky Mountain Saints, 345-6; Hist. B. Young, MS.; Little's Mail Service, MS. ,8As successor to Grant, who died Dec. 1, 1856.

Here the lad remained until he was 14 years of age, and receiving lit- tle educatiou, was trained to his father's calling, that of a farmer. The family then removed to Erie co. , Penn., and two years later Jedediah heard for the first time the doctrines of Mormonism. Being convinced of their truth, he was baptized in 1832, by Elder John F. Boyington, who afterward became an apostle, and, when 18 years of age, accompanied Zion's camp in its migration to Missouri. In the whiter of 1835 he was ordained, at Kirtland, a member of the first quorum of seventy, and the following spring started forth on his first mission, his labors as a missionary extending over eleven years, princi- pally in the southern and middle states. At the expulsion from Nauvoo, he was was one of those who crossed the Mississippi in Feb. 1S46, and though not a pioneer, was among the earliest settlers in the valley of Great Salt Lake, being one of the captains of hundreds appointed during the migration of 1847.

Harnessing his fleetest animals to a light spring wagon, Smoot immediately started homeward, and making the distance from Fort Laramie in about five days, found the brethren celebrating their pioneer anniversary at Little Cottonwood Canon.44 Thus, in part through the stubbornness of the Mor mons, but in part also through the malice of a dissolute and iniquitous judge, the spite of a disappointed mail contractor, the wire-pulling of birds of prey at Wash ington, and possibly in accordance with the policy of the president, who, until the confederate flag had been unfurled at Fort Sumter, retained in the valley of Great Salt Lake nearly all the available forces in the Union army and a store of munitions of war sufficient to furnish an arsenal, was brought about the Utah war-. \"Give us ten years of peace, and we will ask no odds of the United States,\" declared Brigham when the pioneers first entered the valley. And now the ten years had passed, and on the margin of a mountain lake, seven thousand feet above sea-level, under bowers of fragrant pine and fir, twenty-five hundred of the saints were assembled on the 24th of July, 1857.

It was at times like the present, when the hearts of the others sank within them, that his genius rose superior to all obstacles, proving him the born leader that all ac knowledged him to be. Gathering the people around him, he repeated the words uttered ten years before, prophesying even now that at no distant day he would himself become president of the United States, or dictate who should be president. Then festivities were renewed, and when the day was far spent the people returned to their homes with trust in Brigham and the God of Joseph. Then war became the universal theme. Fire-arms were manufactured or repaired; scythes were turned into bayonets; long-unused sabres were burnished and sharpened, and from all parts of the earth the saints were summoned to the defence of Zion. Apostles Lyman and Rich, who were in charge of the saints at San Bernardino, and Orson Hyde, who, as we shall see, had founded a thriving colony in Carson Valley, were ordered to break up their settlements and gather to the defence of Zion. Messengers were sent to the Atlantic states and to Europe to summon home the elders and apostles,45 and, had it been possible, thou sands of converts from all parts of the world would have rallied this year round the standard of the prophet.

Though informed by parties whom he met en route that he would not be allowed to enter the territory, or would do so at the risk of his life, the captain met with a cordial reception. Brigham, Wells, Bernhisel, and other leading citizens called at his quarters on the evening of his arrival, and a formal interview was ap pointed for the following day47 at the social hall, when Van Vliet was introduced to a large number of prom inent Mormons, presented to Brigham an official letter from Harney, and declared the purpose of his mission. The governor and the captain then retired with a few others to a private office, where a conversation took place, from which I give a few extracts that may be of interest to the reader. \"We do not want to fight the United States,\" re marked Brigham, \"but if they drive us to it, we shall do the best we can; and I will tell you, as the Lord lives, we shall come off conquerors. The United States are sending their armies here to simply hold us until a mob can come and butcher us, as has been done before. We are the supporters of the constitu tion of the United States, and we love that constitu tion and respect the laws of the United States; but it is by the corrupt administration of those laws that we are made to suffer. Most of the government of ficers who have been sent here have taken no interest in us, but on the contrary, have tried many times to destroy us.\" \"This is the case with most men sent to the terri tories,\" Van Vliet replied. \"They receive their offices as a political reward, or as a stepping-stone to the sen atorship; but they have no interest in common with the people. The greatest hold that the government now has upon you is in the accusation that you have burned the United States records.\" \" In his Life of Brigham Young. 262, Tullidge gives Aug. 12th, and in his Hist.

And if an army succeeds in penetrating this val ley, tell the government to see that it has forage and provisions in store, for they will find here only a charred and barren waste. We have plenty here of what you want, but we will sell you nothing. Further than this, your army shall not enter this valley.\"48 In vain Van Vliet remonstrated, stating that though the mountain passes might be defended against the small army then approaching Utah, a force would surely be sent, during the following year, that would overcome all opposition. To this warning, several times repeated, but one answer was returned: \"We are aware that such will be the case ; but when these troops arrive they will find Utah a desert; every house will be burned to the ground, every tree cut down, and every field laid waste.

There is little doubt that, so far as I have quoted them, they are substantially true. In his report, ut supra, Van Vliet says that at this and other interviews Brigham declared that 'the Mormons had been persecuted, murdered, and robbed in Missouri and Illinois, both by the mob and state authorities, and that now the U. S. were about-to pursue the same course; and that, therefore, he and the people of Utah had determined to resist all persecution at the commencement.'"], [562, "THE GOVERNMENT IN ARMS. 508 to the mountains and bid defiance to all the powers of the government.\" During the captain's visit, Brigham, with the apos tles, General Wells of the Nauvoo legion, and others, asked him to walk through their grounds, and intro ducing him to some of the Mormon women, showed him the garden-spots which their hands had fashioned out of the wilderness. \" What, madam,\" he exclaimed to one of the sisters, \" would you consent to see this beautiful home in ashes and this fruitful orchard de stroyed?\" \" I would not only consent to it,\" was the answer, \" but I would set fire to my home with my own hands, and cut down every tree, and root up every plant.\" On the following sabbath the captain attended divine service at the tabernacle, when John Taylor, after referring in his discourse to the approach of the troops, and repeating that they should not be allowed to enter the territory, desired all who would apply the torch to their dwellings, cut down their trees, and lay waste their farms to raise their hands. Every hand was raised in a congregation numbering more than four thousand. \" When the time comes to burn and lay waste our improvements,\" said Brigham in a sermon delivered on the same day, \" if any man undertakes to shield his he will be treated as a traitor. . . . Now the faint-hearted can go in peace ; but should that time come, they must not interfere.

He declared, as the Mormons relate, that if the United States made war on them, he would withdraw from the army. Quitting Salt Lake City a few days after ward, he arrived at Washington in November, and delivered his report to the secretary of war.49 On the day after the captain's departure, Brigham issued a proclamation declaring martial law in Utah, forbidding all armed forces to enter the territory under any pretence whatever, and ordering the Mor mon militia to be in readiness to march at a moment's notice.60 It is probable that the Nauvoo legion, which now included the entire militia force of the ter ritory, mustered at this date from four to five thou sand men.61 Though imperfectly armed and equipped, and of course no match for regular troops, they were not to be held in contempt. In July 1857 the legion had been reorganized, the two cohorts, now termed divisions, having each a nominal strength of two thou sand. The divisions consisted of two brigades, the brigades of two regiments, the regiments of five bat talions, each of a hundred men,52 the battalion being divided into companies of fifty, and the companies into platoons of ten.

Those who failed to provide their equipments were fined, and those who disposed of them were tried by court-mar tial and doubly fined. Penalties were also imposed for non-attendance at muster and drill.53 The cavalry arm was for a time abolished 54 as unsuited to moun- tain warfare, and a corps of topographical engineers organized, together with an ordnance corps. All able-bodied males in the territory, except those exempt by law, were liable, as we have seen, to mili tary service, and it is probable that the Mormons could put in the field not less than seven thousand raw troops, half disciplined, indeed, but inured to hard ship, and most of them excellent marksmen.

At this juncture a letter from General Wells was delivered to Colonel Alexander, together with copies of the organic act, the laws of Utah, the proclamation forbidding the entrance of armed forces into the terri tory, and a despatch from Brigham. The last was a remarkable document, and must have been somewhat of a surprise to the colonel, who had proved himself one of the most gallant soldiers of the Mexican war. He was informed that Brigham Young was still gov ernor of Utah, and that he had disregarded his prohi bition. He was ordered to withdraw by the same route that he had entered. Should he desire, how ever, to remain until spring in the neighborhood of his present encampment, he must surrender his arms and ammunition to the Mormon quartermaster-gen eral, in which case he would be supplied with provi sions, and would not be molested.3 The colonel re plied in brief and business-like phrase.

On receiving the answer of Colonel Alexander, Wells determined to open the campaign, a plan of which had been before arranged at Salt Lake City. Inviting to dinner Major Lot Smith, who had con veyed the despatches to and from the enemy's camp, he asked him whether he could take some forty men, the only available force then at the Mormon camp at Cache Cave, where Wells was now encamped, and, passing in rear of the foe, turn back or burn the sup ply trains still on the road. \" I think I can,\" replied Lot Smith; and the next evening he started out. Wells then addressed to Major Joseph Taylor the letter of instructions already quoted. Riding all night at the head of his detachment, Smith came in sight of a westward-bound govern ment train on the morning of October 3d, and ordered the drivers to go back. This they did, but turned round when out of sight. During the day a party of troops passed them, and relieving the wagons of their freight, left them standing. Smith then started for Sandy Fork, sending a few of his men under Captain Haight in another direction. Soon he observed a cloud of dust in the direction of the old Mormon trail, and was informed by his scouts that a train of twenty six wagons was approaching. Halting and feeding his men, he approached them at dusk, while encamped at a spot known as Simpson's Hollow, on Green River, and there lay in ambush for several hours. Mean while he ascertained, as he relates, that there were two trains, each of twenty-six wagons \u2014 there being, in fact, three, with seventy-five wagons in all.4 'Rept of Commissary Clarke, in House Ex.

Most of the team sters were asleep, their weapons fastened to the awn ings of the wagons, and resistance was almost hopeless. The captain of the wagoners, Dawson by name, stepped forward, surrendered his charge, and bade his men stack their arms and group themselves on a spot pointed out by Smith, who dealt with the other trains in like manner. Then, lighting two torches, the major handed one of them to a gentile in his party, dubbed Big James, remarking that it was proper for the gen tiles to spoil the gentiles. Riding from wagon to wagon they set fire to the covers, which caught rapidly in the crisp air of this October night. \" By Saint Patrick, ain't it beautiful!\" exclaimed Big James; \"I never saw anything go better in my life.\" Dawson meanwhile was sent to the rear of the trains to take out provisions for his captors. When all the wagons were fairly in a blaze, the Mormons rode away, telling their panic-stricken captives that they would return as soon as they had delivered the spoils to their com rades near by, and instantly shoot any one who should attempt to extinguish the flames.5 with a few wagons belonging to the sutler of the tenth infantry, a few miles behind the latter. Probably the colonel was for the moment misinformed as to the train abandoned on the morning of the 4th. The destruction of the sutler's wagons was perhaps wrought by Haight's party, as Smith states that they were sent after the convoy of the tenth infantry.

The portions of it which conflict with the testimony of United States officials I have omitted. For instance, Smith says: ' His [Dawson's] orders to the train men were from the commander at Camp Winfield, and were to the effect that the Mormons were in the field, and that they must not go to sleep, but keep guard on their trains, and that four companies of cavalry and two pieces of artillery would come over in the morning to escort them into camp.'

Alexander was un fitted for it, and Johnston had not yet arrived. Win ter was at hand ; forage was almost exhausted; pro visions would fail within a few months; and if the troops could not move into quarters within fourteen days, there would be no animals left alive to convey their supplies. The pitiful strait that had now over taken them is explained in a letter addressed by Colo nel Alexander, four days after the Green River catas trophe, to the officers in command of forces en route for Utah. \"No information of the position or inten tions of the commanding officer has reached me,\" he writes, \"and I am in utter ignorance of the objects of the government in sending troops here, or the instructions given for their conduct after reaching here. I have had to decide upon the following points : First, the necessity of a speedy move to winter quar ters; second, the selection of a point for wintering; third, the best method of conducting the troops and supplies to the point selected.\" A council of war was held, and the point selected was Fort Hall, on Beaver Head Mountain, 140 miles from Fort Bridger. So little did the colonel know even about the disposition of the command, that, at the time and place when he expected to be joined by Colonel Smith, in charge of supply trains, this officer was still at South Pass, with an escort of two hundred men. On the 11th of October the troops commenced their march. Snow was falling heavily, and for sev eral days they were compelled to cut a path for their Supply, and that 100 wagons had been parked for three weeks on Ham Fork without being molested. On the other hand, he states in the same report that Col Waite of the fifth infantry, though not anticipating any trouble, was preparing to send a detachment to the trains when he heard of their destruc- tion.

Meanwhile bands of Mormons, under their nimble and ubiquitous leaders, hung on their flanks, just out of rifle-shot, harassing them at every step, 700 oxen being captured and driven to Salt Lake City on the 13th. There was as yet no cavalry in the force. A few infantry companies were mounted on mules and sent in pursuit of the guerrillas, but the saints merely laughed at them, terming them jackass cavalry. The grass had been burned along the line of route, and the draught-animals were so weak that they could travel but three miles a day. When the point was reached where Smith's detachment was expected to join the army, the commander, disap pointed and sore perplexed, called a second council, at which many of the officers were in favor of cutting their way through the canons at all hazard. At this juncture a despatch was received from Johnston, who was now at South Pass, ordering the troops to proceed to Fontenelle Creek, where pasture was abundant; and a few days later a second despatch directed them to march to a point three miles below the junction of Ham and Black forks, the colonel stating that he would join them at the latter point. On the 3d of November they reached the point of rendezvous, where Johnston arrived the following day, with a reenforcement of cavalry and the supply trains in charge of Smith.6 Albert Sidney Johnston was a favorite officer, and had already given earnest of the qualities that he dis played a few years later in the campaigns of the civil war.

The expedition was now ordered to Fort Bridger, and at every step difficulties increased. There were only thirty-five miles to be traversed, but, except on the margin of a few slender streams, the country through which lay their route was the barest of desert land. There was no shelter from the chill blasts of this mountain solitude, where, even in No vember, the thermometer sometimes sank to 16\u00b0 be low zero. There was no fuel but the wild sage and willow; there was little pasture for the half-frozen cattle. The march commenced on the 6th of November, and on the previous night 500 of the strongest oxen had been stolen by the Mormons. The trains ex tended over six miles, and all day long snow and sleet fell on the retreating column. Some of the men were frost-bitten, and the exhausted animals were goaded by their drivers until many fell dead in their traces. At sunset the troops encamped wherever they could find a particle of shelter, some under bluffs, and some in the willow copses. At daybreak the camp was surrounded with the carcasses of frozen cattle, of which several hundreds had perished during the night. Still, as the trains arrived from the rear, each one halted for a day or more, giving time for the cattle to rest and graze on such scant herbage as they could find. To press forward more rapidly was impossible, for it would have cost the lives of most of the draught-ani mals; to find shelter was equally impossible, for there was none. There was no alternative but to proceed slowly and persistently, saving as many as possible of the horses, mules, and oxen. Fifteen days were re quired for this difficult operation.7 Meanwhile Colo nel St George Cooke, who arrived on the 19th by way of Fort Laramie, at the head of 500 dragoons, had fared no better than the main body, having lost nearly half of his cattle.8 1 Rept of Col Johnston, dated Camp Scott, Nov. 30, 1 857, in House Ex.

A length the army of Utah arrived at Fort Bridger \u2014 to find that the buildings in and around it, together with those at Fort Supply, twelve miles distant, had been burned to the ground by Mormons, and the grain or other provisions removed or destroyed. All that remained were two enclosures surrounded by walls of cobblestone cemented with mortar, the larger one being a hundred feet square. This was appropriated for the storage of supplies, while on the smaller one lunettes were built and mounted with cannon. A sufficient garrison was stationed at this point; the cattle were sent for the winter to Henry Fork, in charge of Colonel Cooke and six companies of the second dragoons, and about the end of November, the remainder of the troops went into winter quar ters on Black Fork of the Green River, two or three miles beyond Fort Bridger, and a hundred and fifteen from Salt Lake City. The site, to which was given the name of Camp Scott, was sheltered by bluffs, day, while crossing what he terms a four-mile hill, Colonel Cooke writes: 'The north wind and drifting snow became severe; the air seemed turned to frozen fog; nothing could be seen; we were struggling in a freezing cloud. The lofty wall at Three Crossings was a happy relief; but the guide, who had lately passed there, was relentless in pronouncing that there was no grass. . . As he promised grass and other shelter two miles farther, we marched on, crossing twice more the rocky stream, half choked with snow and ice; finally he led us behind a great granite rock, but all too small for the promised shel ter. Only a part of the regiment could huddle there in the deep snow; whilst the long night through the storm continued, and in fearful eddies from above, before, behind, drove the falling and drifting snow.' Meanwhile the animals were driven once more across the stream to the base of a granite ridge which faced the storm, but where there was grass. They refused to eat, the mules huddling together and moaning piteously, while some of the horses broke away from the guard and went back to the ford. The next day better camp ing-ground was reached ten miles farther on. On the morning of the 8th, the thermometer marked 44\u00b0 below freezing-point; but in this weather and through deep snow the men made eighteen miles, and the following day nine teen miles, to the next eamping-grounds on Bitter Creek, and in the valley of the Sweetwater. On the 10th matters were still worse. Herders left to bring up the rear with the stray mules could not force them from the valley, and there three fourths of them were left to perish. Nine horses were also aban doned. At night the thermometer marked 25\u00b0 below zero; nearly all the tent-pins were broken, and nearly forty soldiers and teamsters were on the sick-list, most of them being fi-ost-bitten.

From the hoops the canvas de- pended in the shape of a cone, somewhat in the fashion of an Indian wigwam. Even when the tents were closed fires could be lighted without discomfort beneath the tripods, a draught being created by the opening at the top.

About 150 men of the legion were then ordered out and reviewed; and as the party passed other stations, troops drawn up on both sides of the road saluted the governor. At one point a mock attempt was made to arrest him, but Col Kimball interfered. At Echo Caflon hundreds of camp-fires were lighted, in order to deceive him as to the numbers of the Mormon soldiery. Cumming supposed that there were 2,000 to 3,000 of them in or near the canon, whereas, in fact, there were but the 150 men whom he had first seen, a portion of them being halted at each stage, while the rest were ordered to pass by unobserved and await him at the next station.

One of the speakers declared that the government intended to occupy the territory with its troops, whether they were needed to support the civil officials or not. This remark caused the wildest uproar; and, writes the governor, \"I was fully confirmed in the opinion that this people, with their extraordinary religion and customs, would gladly en counter certain death rather than be taxed with a sub mission to the military power, which they consider to involve a loss of honor.\"22 The tumult was stayed by Brigham, and no further symptoms of rebellion occurred during the governor's visit.

Hurt, who, as will be re membered, was the only gentile official remaining in Utah after the departure of Judge Drummond, states that when martial law was proclaimed be was unwilling to apply to Brigham for a passport, and, with the aid of Uintah Indians, made his escape, after much privation, to Johnston's camp, then on the Sweetwater. Ho declares that he was surrounded by Mormons and es caped at great risk of life.

But meanwhile events had occurred which prom ised a peaceable solution of the difficulty. The spir ited resistance of the saints had called forth unfavor- able comments on Buchanan's policy throughout the United States and throughout Europe. He had virtually made war upon the territory before any declaration of war had been issued; he had sent for ward an army before the causes of offence had been fairly investigated; and now, at this critical juncture in the nation's history, he was about to lock up in a distant and almost inaccessible region more than one third of the nation's war material and nearly all its best troops. Even the soldiers themselves, though in cheerful mood and in excellent condition, had no heart for the approaching campaign, accepting, as they did, the commonly received opinion that it was merely a move on the president's political chess-board. In a word, Buchanan and the Washington politicians and the Harney-Johnston army must all confess them selves beaten, hopelessly beaten, before a blow was struck. The army was as powerless before the people it had come to punish as was Napoleon's at Moscow. All that remained to be done was to forgive the Mor mons and let them go. Through the pressure brought to bear, coupled with the expostulations of Kane, Van Vliet, and Bernhisel, Buchanan was induced to stop the threat ened war, and on the 6th of April signed a proclama tion promising amnesty to all who returned to their Hist.

The Mormons did not regard themselves as rebels; but claimed that when Colonel Alexander was ordered to withdraw his forces no successor to Brigham had been legally appointed and qualified, nor had he been removed by the president, and that in obstructing the entrance of an armed force into the territory he had not ex ceeded his powers as commander-in-chief of the militia.27 Moreover, that their complaints had been ignored instead of receiving a patient hearing, and that none of their grievances had been redressed, were among the causes that led to the disturbance.

The document was intrusted to two peace commis sioners \u2014 L. W. Powell, ex-governor and senator elect for Kentucky, and Major B. McCulloch, a soldier of the Mexican war. They were ordered to set out at once for Utah, circulate the proclamation throughout the territory, and point out to the Mormons their unfortunate relations with the government, and how greatly it would be to their interest to submit promptly and peacefully to its laws. They were to assure them that the despatch of the expedition had no reference to their religious tenets, and that if they resumed their allegiance no power in the United States had either the right or the will to interfere with their reli gion. \" To restore peace in this manner,\" writes the secretar}r of war in his instructions, \"is the single purpose of your mission.\"23 On the 29th of May the commissioners arrived at Camp Scott, where they remained four days, gathering information as to the condition of affairs.

But a moment's reflection will show that they were too nearly simultaneous for this to be the case; that in the absence of telegraph and railroad, it would be impossible to execute such a deed three hundred miles away in two days. Indeed, it may as well be under stood at the outset that this horrible crime, so often and so persistently charged upon the Mormon church and its leaders, was the crime of an individual, the crime of a fanatic of the worst stamp, one who was a member of the Mormon church, but of whose intentions the church knew nothing, and whose bloody acts the members of the church, high and low, regard with as much abhorrence as any out of the church. In deed, the blow fell upon the brotherhood with three fold force and damage. There was the cruelty of it, which wrung their hearts; there was the odium at tending its performance in their midst; and there was the strength it lent their enemies further to malign and molest them. The Mormons denounce the Moun- tain Meadows massacre, and every act connected therewith, as earnestly and as honestly as any in the outside world. This is abundantly proved, and may be accepted as a historical fact. I will now proceed to give the incidents as they oc curred.

At Lee's trial James Haslem testi fied, as we shall see later, that he was sent from Cedar City by Isaac C. Haight, with a letter to Brigham, on Monday, Sept. 7th, and that he reached S. L. City at 11 a. M. on Thursday. Deseret News, Sept. 20, 1876. The next day was the 11th. Other accounts differ slightly as to date. 2U. S. Attorney Wilson, in his report in Sen. Doc, 36th Cong. 1st Sess., ii. no. 42, p. 102, states that 119 were killed, and it is certain that 17 children were rescued. Forney and Burton say that 115 to 120 were massacred; Waite, The Mormon Prophet, 66, that the party consisted of 150 men and women, besides a number of children. Stenhouse, Tell It AU, 324, mentions 120 to 130. Other reports vary from 120 to 150. _ * Stenhouse, Rocky Mountain Saints, 424-8, says that the Arkansas and Missouri emigrants formed two separate parties, the latter naming themselves"], [599, "CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANTS. 545 It included about thirty families, most of them related by marriage or kindred, and its members were of every age, from the grandsire to the babe in arms. They belonged to the class of settlers of whom California was in need. * Most of them were farmers by occupa tion; they were orderly, sober, thrifty, and among them was no lack of skill and capital.4 They travelled leisurely and in comfort, stopping at intervals to re cruit their cattle, and about the end of July arrived at Salt Lake City,5 where they hoped to replenish their stock of provisions. For several years after the gold discovery the ar rival of an emigrant party was usually followed, as we have seen, by friendly traffic between saint and gentile, the former thus disposing, to good advantage, of his farm and garden produce. But now all was changed. The army of Utah was advancing on Zion, and the Arkansas families reached the valley at the very time when the Mormons first heard of its ap proach, perhaps while the latter were celebrating their tenth anniversary at Big Cottonwood Canon. More over, wayfarers from Missouri and Arkansas were regarded with special disfavor; the former for reasons that have already appeared, the latter on account of the murder of a well-beloved apostle of the Mormon church. Missouri 'wild-cats,' and that the Arkansas party was advised by a friend of his to keep clear of the Missourians while passing through the Utah settle ments and the portion of that territory occupied by Indians. I find no con firmation of this in other authorities, though, according to Mrs Stenhouse, Tell It All, 325, her husband's friend, whose name was Eli B. Kelsey, 'said that the train was divided into two parts, the first a rough-and-ready set of men \u2014 regular frontier pioneers; the other a picked community.' The truth appears to be, that there were a few Missourians in the Arkansas party, as stated in Hatchings' Cat Mag., iv. 345. 4 They had about 600 head of cattle, 30 wagons, and 30 horses and mules.

Pratt was arraigned before the supreme court at Van Buren, Arkansas, on a charge of abducting the children of one Hector Mc- Lean, a native of New Orleans, but then living in California. He was acquitted; but it is alleged by anti-Mormon writers, and tacitly admitted by the saints, that he was sealed to Hector McLean's wife, who had been baptized into the faith years before, while living in San Francisco, and in 1855 was living in Salt Lake City.6 McLean swore vengeance against the apostle, who was advised to make his escape, and set forth on horseback, unarmed, through a sparsely settled country, where, under the circumstances, escape was almost impossible. His path was barred by two of McLean's friends until McLean himself with three others overtook the fugitive, when he fired six shots at him, the balls lodging in his saddle or passing through his clothes. McLean then stabbed him twice \u2022The account- given in the Millennial Star, xix. 417-18, is that McLean, after treating his wife in a brutal manner for several years, turned her into the streets of San Francisco, and secretly conveyed the children on board a steamer for New Orleans, where the woman followed him; but finding that her parents were in the plot, set forth for Salt Lake City. Returning to New Orleans in 1856, she rescued her children and fled to Texas; but was followed by her husband, who had previously returned to California, and now regained Eossession of the children. Parley, who had already befriended Mrs McLean, ad written to inform her that her husband was in pursuit. Hence the prosecution. McLean and his wife finally separated in San Francisco in 1855. See also Autobiog. of Parley P. Pratt, app. Stenhouse relates that Mrs McLean was married or sealed to Pratt in Utah, that she met Pratt in Arkan sas on her way to Utah, and that the apostle was acquitted on account of her assuming the responsibility for the abduction. He admits, however, that the apostle did not abduct the children. Rocky Mountain Saints, 429. Burton says that Pratt converted Mrs McLean and took her to wife, but on what authority he does not state. City of the Saints, 412. The fact, however, that Mrs McLean arrived on the scene of the apostle's assassination just before his death, as mentioned in the Millennial Star, xix. 478, wears a suspicious look. In the S. F. Bulletin of March 24, 1877, it is stated that the apostle made the acquaintance of Mrs McLean while engaged in missionary work in San Fran cisco; that her husband, who was a custom-house official and a respectable citizen, ordered him to discontinue his visits, and kicked him out of the house for continuing them surreptitiously; and that the woman was so infatuated with the Mormon elder that she devoutly washed his feet whenever he visited her. On arriving at Fort Smith (near Van Buren), McLean found letters from Parley Pratt addressed to his wife, one of them signed ' Your own, \u2014 \u2014 .' The McLean residence in San Francisco, on the corner of Jones and Filbert streets, was in 1877 a dilapidated frame building, a story and a half in height. As to the apostle's assassination, the Bulletin merely states that he was overtaken by McLean and shot within eight miles of Van Buren, and that he died of his wounds an hour afterward."], [601, "MURDER OF PRATT 547 with a bowie-knife under the left arm, whereupon Parley dropped from his horse, and the assassin, after thrusting his knife deeper into the wounds, seized a derringer belonging to one of his accomplices, and shot him through the breast. The party then rode off, and McLean escaped unpunished.7 Thus, when the Arkansas families arrived at Salt Lake City, they found the Mormons in no friendly mood, and at once concluded to break camp and move on. They had been advised by Elder Charles C: Rich to take the northern route along the Bear River, but decided to travel by way of southern Utah. Pass ing through Provo, Springville, Payson, Fillmore, and intervening settlements, they attempted every where to purchase food, but without success. Toward the end of August they arrived at Corn Creek,8 some fifteen miles south of Fillmore, where they encamped for several days. In this neighborhood, on a farm set apart for their use by the Mormons, lived the Pah Vants, whom, as the saints allege, the emigrants at tempted to poison by throwing arsenic into one of the springs and impregnating their own dead cattle with strychnine. It has been claimed that this charge was disproved; and what motive the Arkansas party could have had for thus surrounding themselves with treacherous and blood-thirsty foes has never been explained. In the valleys throughout the southern portion of the territory grows a poisonous weed, and it is possible that the cattle died from eating of this 1 This account of Parley's murder is based on the testimony of Qeo.

Continuing their journey, the emigrants proceeded to Beaver City, and thence to Panrwan. Grain was scarce this year, and the emigrants were unable to purchase all they desired for their stock, though for their own immediate necessities they obtained what they required at this place. Arriving at Cedar City, they succeeded in purchasing about fifty bushels of wheat, which was ground at a mill belonging to John D. Lee, formerly commander of the fort at Cedar, but then Indian agent, and in charge of an Indian farm near Harmony.

In a letter to Brigham, dated Harmony, Nov. 20, 1857, Lee writes: ' The company there [at Corn Crtek] poisoned the meat of an ox, which they gave the Pah Vant Indians to eat, causing four of them to die immediately, besides poisoning a number more.

In his confession, made a few months after his trial, Lee declares that President Isaac C. Haight told him of the poisoning and other atrocities committed by the emigrants, and gave him instructions as to the part he should take in the massacre. After that event Lee states (still iu his confession), 'I thought over the matter, and made up my mind to write the letter to Brigham Young and lay it all to the Indians.' /(/., 254."], [603, "CHARGES AGAINST THE EMIGRANTS. 549 City to Cedar the emigrants were guilty of further gross outrage. If we can believe a statement made in the confession of Lee, a few days before his death, Isaac C. Haight, president of the stake at Cedar, ac cused them of abusing women, of poisoning wells and streams at many points on their route, of destroying fences and growing crops, of violating the city ordi nances at Cedar, and resisting the officers who at tempted to arrest them. These and other charges, even more improbable,11 have been urged in extenua tion of the massacre; but little reliance can be placed on Lee's confession, and most of them appear to be unfounded.12 It must be admitted, however, that rather than see their women and children starve, they perhaps took by force such necessary provisions as they were not allowed to purchase. Near Cedar City the Spanish trail, to Santa Fe branched off from what was then known as Frdmont's route. About thirty miles to the south-west of Cedar, and within fifteen of the line of the route, are the Mountain Meadows, which form the divide between the waters of the great basin and those that flow into the Colorado. At the southern end of the meadows, which are four to five miles in length and one in width, but here run to a narrow point, is a large stream, the banks of which are about ten feet in height. Close to this stream the emigrants were encamped on the 5th of September, almost midway between two 11 ' They proclaimed that they had the very pistol with which the prophet Joseph Smith was murdered, and had threatened to kill Brigham and all of the apostles.

Thereupon the attacking party, which num bered from three to four hundred, withdrew to the hills, on the crests of which they built parapets, whence they shot down all who showed themselves outside the intrenchment.

When within a few hundred yards of the intrenchment, the company halted, and one of them, William Bateman by name, was sent forward with a flag of truce. In answer to this signal a little girl, dressed in white, appeared in an open space be tween the wagons. Half-way between the Mormons and the corral, Bateman was met by one of the emi grants named Hamilton, to whom he promised pro tection for his party on condition that their arms were surrendered, assuring him that they would be con ducted safely to Cedar City.

It was then arranged that Lee should conclude terms with the emigrants, and, as soon as they had delivered themselves into the power of the Mormons, should start for Hamblin's rancho, on the eastern side of the meadows, with the wagons and arms, the young children, and the sick and wounded. The men and women, the latter in front, were to follow the wagons, all in single file, and on each side of them the militia were to be drawn up, two deep, and with twenty paces between their lines. Within two hundred yards of the camp the men were to be brought to a halt, until the women approached a copse of scrub-oak, about a mile distant, and near to which Indians lay in ambush. The men were now to resume their march, the militia forming in single file, each one walking by the side of an emigrant, and carrying his musket on the left arm.

Entering the corral, Lee found the emigrants en gaged in burying two of their party who had died of wounds. Men, women, and children thronged around him, some displaying gratitude for their rescue, some distrust and terror. The brother played his part well. Bidding the men pile their arms in the wagons, to avoid provoking the Indians, he placed in them the women, the small children, and a little clothing. While thus engaged, one Daniel McFar land rode up, with orders from Major Higbee to hasten their departure, as the Indians threatened to renew the attack.

In the S. F. Call, July 30, 1881, it is stated that Bishop Klingensmith was murdered in Mexico, There is no important discrepancy in the several versions. Forney and Cradlebaugh officially inves tigated the matter in 1859. The statements of both are very brief, and why the investigation was not made sooner does not appear. News of the mas sacre was first received in Washington in Feb. 1858. See letter of C. E. Mix, acting commissioner of Indian affairs, to Senator W. K.

The corpses had been entirely stripped by the Indians, who had also carried off the clothing, provisions, wagon-covers, and even the bedding of the emigrants. In one group were the naked bodies of six or seven women, in another those of ten young children, some of them horribly mangled and most of them scalped. The dead were now dragged to a ra vine near by and piled in heaps; a little earth was scattered over them, but so little that it was washed away by the first rains, leaving the remains to be de voured by wolves and coyotes, the imprint of whose teeth was afterward found on their bones. It was not until nearly two years later that they were de cently interred by a detachment of troops, sent for that purpose from Camp Floyd. On reaching Moun tain Meadows, the men found skulls and bones scat tered for the space of a mile around the ravine, whence they had been dragged by wild beasts. Nearly all the bodies had been gnawed by wolves, so that few could be recognized, and their dismembered skeletons were bleached by long exposure. Many of the skulls were crushed in with the but-ends of muskets or cleft with tomahawks ; others were shattered by fire-arms, discharged close to the head. A few remnants of apparel, torn from the backs of women and children as they ran from the clutch of their pursuers, still fluttered among the bushes, and near by were masses of human hair, matted and trodden in the mould.23 1859; Jan. 29, 1867; Nov. 28, 1872; Nov. 24, 1874; Cat Mercantile Journal, 1S60, pp. 1S3-4; Stockton Independent, June 11, 1S79; SanJos4 Weekly Argus, Dec. 5, 1874; Santa Cruz Sentinel, May 12, 1877; San Buenaventura Signal, June 23, 1877; Winnemucca Silver State, July 19, 1875; Anlioch Ledger, Nov. 21, 1875; Austin Reese River Reveille, July 12, 1804; Gold Hill News, Sept. 21, 1872; Feb. 1, 1875; Sept. 12, 1876; Carson Stale Register, Sept. 26, 1872; Pres colt Miner, Dec. 12, 1874, Apr. 11, 1879; Idaho World, Oct. 1, 1S75; Portland Weekly Standard, Apr. 6, 1877; Or.

His reasons for evading this duty are best explained in his own words. In his deposition at the trial of John D. Lee, when asked why he had not instituted proceed ings, he thus made answer: \"Because another gov ernor had been appointed by the president of the United States, and was then on the way here to take my place, and I did not know how soon he might ar rive; and because the United States judges were not in the territory. Soon after Governor Cumming ar rived I asked him to take Judge Cradlebaugh, who belonged to the southern district, with him, and I would accompany them with sufficient aid to inves tigate the matter and bring the offenders to ius tice.\"28 Lynch, who accompanied Forney's party, states under oath that when he first saw them the children were 'with little or no clothing, covered with filth and dirt.' Id., p. 81. Judge Cradlebaugh says nothing about their being ill treated. It was at first supposed that the children had been left in the hands of Indians, but this is denied by all the officers and officials whose re ports are given in Id. , passim.

They say they never were in the custody of the Indians. I recol lect one of them, John Calvin Sorrow, after he found he was safe, and before he was brought away from Salt Lake City, although not yet nine years of age, sitting in a contemplative mood, no doubt thinking of the extermination of his family, saying: \"Oh, I wish I was a man!

For several months it was believed by the federal authorities that this was the case ; when it became known, however, that some of the children had been spared, suspicion at once pointed elsewhere, for among all the murders committed by the Utahs, there was no instance of their having shown any such compunction. Moreover, it was soon ascertained that an armed party of Mormons had left Cedar City, had returned with spoil, and that the Indians complained of being unfairly treated in the division of the booty. Notwithstanding their utmost efforts, some time elapsed before the United States officials procured evidence sufficient to bring home the charge of mur der to any of the parties implicated, and it was not until March 1859 that Judge Cradlebaugh held a ses sion of court at Provo. At this date only six or eight, persons had been committed for trial, and were now in the guard-house at Camp Floyd,29 some of them being accused of taking part in the massacre and some of other charges. Accompanied by a military guard, as there was no jail within his district and no other means of securing the prisoners, the judge opened court on the 8th. In his address to the grand jury he specified a number of crimes that had been committed in southern Utah, including the massacre. \"To allow these things to pass over,\" he observed, \"gives a color as if they were done by authority. The very fact of such a case as the Mountain Meadows shows that there was some person high in the estimation of the people, and it was done by that authority . . .

The higher authority of which he spoke could mean only the authority of the church, or in other words, of the first presidency; and to contemn and threaten to im- peach that authority before a Mormon grand jury was a gross judicial blunder. Though there may have been cause for suspicion, there was no fair color of testimony, and there is none yet, that Brigham or his colleagues were implicated in the massacre. Apart from the hearsay evidence of Cradlebaugh and of an officer in the army of Utah,32 together with the state- ments of John D. Lee,33 there is no basis on which to frame a charge of complicity against them.

The judge replied that good American citizens need have no fear of American troops, whereupon the citizens of Provo petitioned Governor Cumming to order their removal. Cum ming, who was then at Provo, was officially informed by the mayor that the civil authorities were prepared and ready to keep in safe custody all prisoners arrested for trial, and others whose presence might be neces sary.

The judges also received a sharp rebuke at the bands of Attorney-general Black, who thus sums up the case: ' On the whole, the president is very decidedly of opinion: 1. That the gov ernor of the territory alone has power to issue a requisition upon the com manding general for the whole or part of the army; 2. That there was no apparent occasion for the presence of the troops at Provo; 3. That if a rescue of the prisoners in custody bad been attempted, it was the duty of the marshal, and not of the judge, to summon the force which might be necessary to prevent it; 4. That the troops ought not to have been sent to Provo without the concurrence of the governor, nor kept there against his remonstrance; 5.

The district attorney46 refused, there fore, to accept the confession, on the ground that it was not made in good faith. Finally the case was brought to trial on the 23d of July, and the result was that the jury, of whom eight were Mormons, failed to agree, after remaining out of court for three days.47 Lee was then remanded for a second trial, which was held before the district court at Beaver City between the 13th and 20th of September, 1876, Judge Boreman again presiding.48 45 Portions of this first confession will be found in Id., 8-9; S.

They listened in vain. In opening the case to the jury, the district attorney49 stated that he came there to try John D. Lee, and not Brigham Young and the Mormon church. He proposed to prove that Lee had acted in direct opposition to the feelings and wishes of the officers of the Mormon church; that by means of a flag of truce Lee had induced the emi grants to give up their arms; that with his own hands the prisoner had shot two women, and brained a third with the but-end of his rifle; that he had cut the throat of a wounded man, whom he dragged forth from one of the wagons; and that he had gathered up the property of the emigrants and used it or sold it for his own benefit.50 These charges, and others relating to incidents that have already been mentioned, were in the main sub stantiated. The first evidence introduced was docu mentary, and included the depositions of Brigham Young and George A. Smith, and a letter written by Lee to the former, wherein he attempted to throw the entire responsibility of the deed upon the Indians. Brigham alleged that he heard nothing about the massacre until some time after it occurred, and then only by rumor; that two or three months later Lee called at his office and gave an account of the slaugh ter, which he charged to Indians; that he gave no directions as to the property of the emigrants, and knew nothing about its disposal; that about the 10th of September, 1857, he received a communication from Isaac C.

George A. Smith, who had been suspected of complicity, through at tending a council at which Dame, Haight, and others had arranged their plans, denied that he was ever an accessary thereto. He also deposed that he had met the emigrants at Corn Creek, some eighty miles north of Cedar, on the 25th of August, while on his way to Salt Lake City, and that when he first heard of the massacre he was in the neighborhood of Fort Bridger. The first witness examined was Daniel H. Wells, who merely stated that Lee was a man of influence among the Indians, and understood their language sufficiently to converse with them. James Haslem testified that between five and six o'clock on Mon- day, September 7, 1857, he was ordered by Isaac C. Haight to start for Salt Lake City and with all speed deliver a letter or message to Brigham Young. He arrived at 11 A. m. on the following Thursday, and four hours later was on his way back with the an swer. As he set forth, Brigham said to him: \"Go with all speed, spare no horse-flesh. The emigrants must not be meddled with, if it takes all Iron county to prevent it. They must go free and unmo lested.\"51 Samuel McMurdy testified that he saw Lee shoot one of the women, and two or three of the sick and wounded who were in the wagons. Jacob Hamblin alleged that soon after the massacre he met Lee within a few miles of Fillmore, when the latter stated that two young girls,62 who had been hiding in the underbrush at Mountain Meadows, were brought into his presence by a Utah chief. The Indian asked what should be done with them. \"They must be shot,\" answered Lee; \"they are too old to be spared.\" 61 RM.

If Haslem's statement was true, Brigham was clearly no accomplice; if it was false, and his errand to Salt Lake City w7as a mere trick of the first presidency, it is extremely improbable that Brigham would have betrayed his intention to Yan Yliet by using the remarks that he made only two days before the event. Moreover, apart from other considerations, it is impossible to reconcile the latter theory with the shrewd and far-sighted policy of this able leader, who well knew that his militia were no match for the army of Utah, and who would have been the last one to rouse the vengeance of a great nation against his handful of followers.54 Lee was convicted of murder in the first degree, and being allowed to select the mode of his execution, was sentenced to be shot. The case was appealed to the supreme court of Utah, but the judgment was sustained, and it was ordered that the sentence should be carried into effect on the 23d of March, 1877.56 William H. Dame, Isaac C. Haight, and others who had also been arraigned for trial, were soon afterward discharged from custody.

Around the cairn that marks their grave still flit, as some have related, the phantoms of the murdered emigrants, and nightly reenact in ghastly pantomime the scene of this hideous tragedy. About ten o'clock on the morning of the 23d a party of armed men alighting from their wagons approached the site of the massacre. Among them were the United States marshal, William Nelson, the district attorney, a military guard, and a score of private citizens. In their midst was John Doyle Lee. Over the wheels of one of the wagons blankets were placed to serve as a screen for the firing party. Some rough pine boards were then nailed together in the shape of a coffin, which was placed near the edge of the cairn, and upon it Lee took his seat until the preparations were completed. The marshal now read the order of the court, and, turning to the prisoner, said: \"Mr Lee, if you have anything to say before the order of the court is carried into effect, you can do so now.\" Rising from the coffin,63 he looked calmly around for a moment, and then with unfaltering voice repeated in substance the statements already quoted from his confession. \"I have but little to say this morning,\" he added. \"It seems I have to be made a victim; a victim must be had, and I am the victim. I studied to make Brigham Young's will my pleasure for thirty years. See now what I have come to this day ! I have been sacrificed in a cowardly, dastardly manner. I cannot help it; it is my last word; it is so. I do not fear death; I shall never go to a worse place than I am now in.

Seating himself with his face to the firing party, and with hands clasped over his head, he exclaimed : \" Let them shoot the balls through my heart. Don't let them mangle my body.\" The word of command was given; the report of rifles rang forth on the still morning air, and without a groan or quiver the body of the criminal fell back lifeless on his coffin.

Though the Mormon authorities had no cause for complaint as to the conduct of the soldiery, they regarded their presence as a menace, and condemned the proceedings of the general and the judges as a personal insult to the governor. After the arrival of the army, Brigham never ap peared in public without a body-guard of his own in timate friends;1 and for many months he attended no public assemblies. At the door of his residence sentries kept watch by day, and at night a strong guard was stationed within its walls. Nor were these precautions unnecessary.

But the trouble was not yet ended. In May, Judge Sinclair was to open his court at Salt Lake City, and threatened to station there a detachment of troops.

Dotson, a native of Virginia, came to Salt Lake City in 1851, and was first employed by Brigham as man ager of a distillery, afterward becoming express and mail agent. In 1855 he was appointed U. S. marshal for Utah, and in 1857 proceeded to Washing ton, returning with the army during that year. Dotson's Doings, MS. 8 In a conversation with Stenhouse, the governor stated that, in case of re sistance, the wall surrounding Brigham's premises was to be battered down with artillery, and the president taken by force to Camp Floyd. So, at least, said the officers. ' I listened to them, sir, as gravely as I could,' continued Cumming, 'and examined their papers. They rubbed their hands and were jubilant; \"they had got the dead-wood on Brigham Young.\" I was indig nant, sir, and told them, \"By , gentlemen, you can't do itl When you have to take Brigham Young, gentlemen, you shall have him without creep ing through walls.

Wells, Narr., MS., 03-5, states that Brigham attended court, though his followers were very unwilling to allow it, as they feared a repetition of the Carthage jail tragedy, but that no proceedings were taken against him.

Surely it was not intended to clothe each one of the judges, as well as the marshal and all his deputies, with this tremendous authority. Especially does this construction seem erroneous when we reflect that these different officers might make requisitions conflicting with one another, and all of them crossing the path of the governor.\"5 The judges were super seded a few months later;6 and thus the matter was finally set at rest, the action of the governor being sustained, although he became so unpopular with the cabinet that for a time his removal was also under consideration.7 Though his resignation was not de- account of the matter: ' I told Cumming myself that we didn't intend the Carthage scene reenacted, and he knew that we intended to resist the troops, which we did. I went to see Cumming frequently, and talked the matter over with him, and he declared himself that he could not recommend Gov. Young to trust himself to that military mob; but he did say he could not see how bloodshed could be hindered. I told him we would not let them come; that if they did come, they would never get out alive if we could help it. He said he did not know what to do.

The government stores at Camp Floyd, valued at $4,000,000, were sold at extremely low prices, greatly to the relief of the saints, who could now purchase pro visions, clothing, wagons, live-stock, and other articles of which they were in need, at their own rates. Flour, which had cost the nation $570 per ton, sold for less than $11 per ton, and other stores in the same propor tion; the entire proceeds of the sale did not exceed $100,000, or little more than two per cent of the out lay; and of this sum $40,000 was contributed by Brigham.9 At the sale at Camp Floyd some of the leading Both these authorities claim that Cumming was aided by Col Kane, who about this time delivered a lecture before the historical society of New York on the situation of Utah, in which he spoke of Cumming as a clear-headed, resolute, but prudent executive, and the very man for the trying position. Stenhouse was present at the lecture as reporter for the New York Herald, and notices of it were widely published throughout the country. 8 Before his departure the citizens desired to show their respect by some public demonstration, but this he declined, slipping away so quietly that his departure was not known until it was published in the Deseret News of May 22d.

In 1836 he was mayor of Augusta, Ga, and during the cholera epidemic of that year used his utmost effort to save the lives of the citizens.

Between the years 1850 and 1862 they had increased in number from 1 1,380 to about 65,000, a gain that has seldom been equalled in any of the states or territories of the republic.11 They were a very healthy community, the number of deaths recorded in the census report for the year ending June 1860 being little more than nine per thousand,12 though this is doubtless a mistake, the actual death rate being proba bly at least twelve per thousand.13 Of the mortality, 10 For descriptions of public festivities, between 1855 and 1865, see Deseret News, Jan. 4, July 18, 1855; July 9, 30, Aug. 6, 1856; July 8, 15, 22, 1857; July 11, Aug. 1, 1860; July 10, 1861; July 9, 30, 1862; July 8, 1863; July 6, 20, 27, 1S64; July 5, Aug. 5, 1S65; Tullidge's Life of Young; 247-9, Burton's City of the Saints, 424-5; S.

The following extracts from -the sanitary report of Assist- ant-surgeon Robert Bartholow of Utah terr., dated Sept. 1858, and published iu Sen. Doc, 36th Cong. 1st Sess., xiii. 301-2, may serve as a specimen of the prejudice of U. S. otficials on matters relating to the territory, and help to account for their blunders: 'The Mormon, of all the animals now walking this globe, is the most curious in every relation.' 'Isolated in the narrow valleys of Utah, and practising the rites of a religion grossly material, of which polygamy is the main element and cohesive force, the Mormons have arrived at a physical and mental condition, in a few years of growth, such as densely populated communities in the older parts of the world, hereditary victims of all tho vices of civilization, have been ages in reaching.

Wages were somewhat high at this period, common laborers receiving $2 per day and domestic servants $30 to $40 per month. Lumbermen, wood-choppers, brick-makers, masons, carpenters, plasterers, and paint ers were in demand at good rates; though until 1857, and perhaps for a year or two later, their hire was usually paid in kind, as there was still but little money in circulation. Thus, a mechanic might be required to receive his wages in hats, boots, or clothing, whether he needed such articles or not, and must probably submit to a heavy discount in disposing of his wares for cash or for such goods as he might require. Some commodities, however, among which were flour, sugar, coffee, and butter, could usually be sold at their par value, and some could not even be bought for cash in large quantities. Most of the stores divided their stock into two classes of wares, which they termed cash-goods and shelf-goods, and the tradesman ob jected to sell any considerable amount of the former unless he disposed, at the same time, of a portion of 18 For list of premiums and diplomas, see Burton's City of the Saints, 384-7. \"From the list of prices-current at the tithing-office in 1860, we learn that cereals were rated in Salt Lake City at $1.50 per bushel, butcher's meat at 3 to 12 J cents per pound, chickens and ducks at 10 to 25 cents each, eggs at 18 cents per dozen, milk at 10 ceuts per quart, ancT butter at 25 cents per pound; but sugar worth in New York about 6 cents per pound cost in Utah 35 to 60 cents, while tea ranged in price from \u00a71.50 to $3.50, and coffee from 40 to 60 cents per pound, or at least fivefold their cost in the Atlantic states."], [633, "TRADE AND AGRICULTURE. 579 the latter.

I must dole out the one with care that I may be able to get rid of the other.\"20 In some of the shop windows on Main Street were displayed costly imported commodities \u2014 silks, velvets, and shawls of diverse pattern, jewelry, laces, and millinery;21 near by were less pretentious stores, where home-made and second-hand articles were retailed. In some of the latter might be seen a curious collection of dilapidated merchandise, and people almost as sin gular as the wares over which they chaffered.

Approaching Zion from the direction of Fort Bridger, after days of travel through sage-brush and buffalo-grass, the traveller would observe that within a score of leagues from Salt Lake City nature's barren ness began to succumb to the marvellous energy of the saints.

The fields were billowing with grain, the cattle sleek and thriving, the barns well filled, the wind mills buzzing merrily. Nevertheless, among these smiling settlements a painful deficiency might be noticed. Everything that industry and thrift could accomplish had been done for the farm, but nothing for the home. Between the houses of the poor and the rich there was little difference, except that one was of logs and the other of boards.

Most of the private houses were still of wood or adobe, some few only being of stone, and none pretentious as to architecture; but nearly all were surrounded with gardens in which fruit and shade trees were plentiful. Many of them were of the same pattern, barn-shaped, with wings and tiny case ments, for glass was not yet manufactured by the Mormons. A few of the better class were built on a foundation of sandstone, and somewhat in the shape of a bungalow, with trellised verandas, and low flat roofs supported by pillars. Those of the poor were small hut-like buildings, most of them one-storied, and some with several entrances. At this date the entire city, except on its southern side, was enclosed by a wall some ten or twelve feet high, with semi- bastions placed at half musket-range, and pierced here and there with gateways.22 In driving through the suburbs the visitor would find the thoroughfares in bad condition, dusty in sum- mer, and in winter filled with viscid mud. On either side were posts and rails, which, as the heart of the city was approached, gave way to neat fences of palings. On Main Street were the abodes of some of the leading Mormon dignitaries and the stores of prominent gentile merchants. On the eastern side, nearly opposite the post-office, and next door to a small structure that served for bath-house and bakery, stood the principal hostelry, the Salt Lake House, a large pent-roofed building, in front of which was a ve randa supported by painted posts, and a sign-board swinging from a tall flag-staff.

Among the principal attractions was the temple block, surrounded in 1860 with a wall of red sand stone, on which were placed layers of adobe, fashioned in imitation of some richer substance, and raising it to a height of ten feet. On each face of the wall were thirty pilasters, also of adobe, protected by sandstone copings, but without pedestals or entablatures. Up to the year 1860 the cost of the wall and the founda tions of the edifice already amounted to $1,000,000, a sum equal to the entire outlay on the temple at Nau voo. The block was consecrated on the 3d of Febru- ary, 1853, and the corner-stones laid with imposing ceremonies on the 6th of the following April.24 In August 1860, the foundations, which were sixteen feet deep and of gray granite, had been completed, but no further progress had been made. I shall reserve until later a description of the building as it now stands.

All had access to the public library under proper restrictions, and in the council-house was opened, in 1853, the first reading-room, which was supplied with newspapers and magazines from all parts of the world.

Prominent among the charitable associations was the Relief Society, originally organized by Joseph Smith at Nauvoo in 1842, and discontinued after his assassination until 1855, when it was reestablished in Salt Lake City. After that date its operations gradu ally extended from ward to ward and from settlement to settlement, until it became a powerful influence for good throughout the land.

His stay in S. L. City lasted less than four weeks (from Aug. 25 to Sept. 20, 1860), excursions being made during his visit to points of interest in the neighborhood, but he saw more during that time than many others have done in four years. Travelling in company with Lieut Dana of the U. S. artillery, aud procuring introduc tions to Gov. Cumming, Brigham Young, and several of the church dignitaries, he had every opportunity to note the different phases of Mormon life. The first aud last portions of the work are taken up with his travels from St Jo seph, Mo., to San Francisco, the middle chapters only relating to Utah.

There are chapters about religion, government, settlements, morals, institutions, and some that appear to be about nothing in particular, unless it be Mr Chandless. Nevertheless, items of interest may be gleaned from them, as the author made a tour of the principal counties in 1855, and travellers in those parts were rare at this period.

The oratory was somewhat of the Boanerges stamp, and contained much round abuse of the gentiles; but looking at the audience, which consisted, in the main, of a thriving, contented, and industrious class of people, light-hearted and ever ready to laugh at the somewhat broad jokes of the church dignitaries, it was impossible to believe all the hard things spoken and written of them bv their enemies. Moreover, about one third of the population consisted at this date of emigrants from Great Britain, and at least two fifths were foreigners of other nationalities, most of them Danes, Swedes, or Norwegians.

Burton says that the prophet was dressed in gray homespun, and wore a tall steeple-crowned hat, as did most of the elders. Describing one of his addresses, he writes: ' Brigham Young removed his hat, advanced to the end of the tribune, and leaning slightly forward upon both hands, propped on the green baize of the tribune, addressed his followers. The discourse began slowly, word crept titubantly after word, and the opening phrases were hardly audible; but as the orator warmed, his voice rose high and sonorous, and a fluency so remarkable suc ceeded falter and hesitation, that although the phenomenon is not rare in strong speakers, the latter seemed almost to have been a work of art. The manner was pleasing and animated, and the matter fluent, impromptu, and well turned, spoken rather than preached; if it had a fault, it was rather rambling and disconnected . . .The gestures were easy and rounded, not with out a certain grace, though evidently untaught; one, however, must be ex cepted, namely that of raising the forefinger. . .The address was long.

Such was Zion in 1860, and such its population. Of the progress and condition of other settlements established soon after the Mormon occupation, and the founding of which has already been mentioned, I shall have occasion to speak later. During the thir teen years that had now elapsed since first they en tered the valley, the saints had pushed forward their colonies in all directions almost to the verge of their territory. Especially was this the case toward the west, where, at an early date, they came into antag onism with settlers from California. In 1850 a few persons from that state had settled in Carson valley for trading purposes, the migration of gold-seekers, some of whom wintered in that region, being then very considerable. During the following year several Mormons entered the valley, John Reese, who arrived there in the spring with thirteen wagon-loads of pro visions, building the first house, known for several years as the Mormon station, on the site of the pres ent village of Genoa.45 Reese first came to the val ley alone, his nearest neighbor, James Fennimore, living in Gold Canon, some twenty-five miles distant, in a \"dug-out,\" or hole scooped out of the bank, the front part covered in this instance with rags and strips of canvas, the man being thriftless and a dram drinker. He was nicknamed Virginia, and after him was named the city whence more bullion has been shipped in a single yeas than would now replace the floating capital of the states of California and Nevada.48 45 It served as hotel and store, and was a two-story log building, 50 x 30 ft.

The choice fell on Orson Hyde, who with Judge Styles, the United States marshal, and an escort of thirty-five men, reached the settlement of John Reese in June 1855, other f>arties of Mormons arriving during this and the sol- owing year. Meanwhile miners, farmers, and herds men from California and the Atlantic states had set tled in the valley and elsewhere on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada in such numbers as to alarm the Mormons, who now desired them to leave the territory. This they refused to do, and some pre tended fears of a resort to force. The gentiles forti fied themselves, and assumed an aggressive attitude, and for two weeks the opposing forces were en camped almost within sight of each other, but with out coming to blows. News of the disturbance reached the mining camps on the other side of the mountains, and numbers prepared to go in aid of their comrades. The aggressors now feared that they would be them selves expelled from the country, and proposed a truce, under which all should be aEowed to remain on their lands. As soon as the matter became known to the authorities, the county organization was repealed, the probate judge recalled, and the records, which contained several criminal indictments of a serious readily and at high prices to emigrants who, as he says, would pay almost any price for provisions, a small bunch of turnips selling for a dollar.

When news arrived of the approach of the army of Utah, the Carson Mormons were ordered, as we have seen, to return to Zion and aid in its defence, though a few remained in the valley. In 1859 the gentile inhabitants, after several fruitless appeals to con gress, formally declared their independence,49 and de manded admission as a territory. Two years later the request was granted, and the territory of Nevada was cut off from Utah, its eastern limit being fixed at the thirty-ninth meridian, but extended by act of 1862 to the thirty-eighth, and by act of 1866 to the thirty-seventh meridian. Reluctantly the Mormons relinquished these portions of the public domain. In Eagle and Washoe valleys they had also estab lished small settlements in 1854 and 1855, remaining until recalled in 1857, at which latter date, as will be remembered, the colony at San Bernardino in Cali fornia was also abandoned. During the Mormon occupation the county of San Bernardino was cut off from that of Los Angeles, the former assuming its proportion of the liabilities.

The letter, which is somewhat bitter in tone, was written with a view to the admission of Nevada as a territory. Life and property were somewhat in secure in Carson valley about this date, and vigilance committees were con stantly on the alert. See Sac.

Most of the Mormons still remained, however, in Cali- fornia, betaking themselves to farming and lumbering until the time of the gold discovery, when they gath- ered at the mines on Mormon Island. Between 1848 and 1850 about a hundred and forty of them found their way to Utah; the remainder cast in their lot with the gentiles, and most of them, among whom was their leader, apostatized, though a few afterward joined the Mormon communities at San Bernardino and in Arizona.63 80 Elder Rich, who arrived at S.

Coalville, the present county seat, was first settled in 1859.65 In 1858 the site of the present town of Kamas was occupied as a grazing ground by Thomas Rhoads, and was then known as Rhoads Valley. Two years later a few families settled there, and in 1862 a ward was organ ized, with William G. Russell as presiding elder.66 About seven miles north-west of Kamas, and on the east bank of the Weber, the village of Peoa was founded in 1860 by a party of ten settlers.67 In 1853 Fort Bridger, with its Mexican grant of thirty square miles of land, on which stood a few cabins, was sold for $8,000 to the Mormons,53 who during the following year expended an equal sum in improvements. This was the first property owned by the saints in Green River county. At Fort Sup ply, in this neighborhood, a settlement was formed about the same time by John Nebeker, Isaac Bullock, and about fifty others from Salt Lake and Utah coun ties. In 1862 the first settlement was made in Wa satch county, south of Green River and Summit coun ties, on the site of the present village of Wallsburg.59 Situated for the most part at an elevation of about seven thousand feet, with a heavy snow-fall and pro lific of streams, this section of the territory was and is yet mainly used for stock-ranges, though in the 64 The Summit County Railroad. 65 By H.

The village of Milton was settled by Thurston in 1856, and Enter- prise, which together with Morgan is now on the line of the Union Pacific, in 1862. In 1856 a party of six brethren settled in Cache Valley on the site of the present town of Wellsville, Cache county, north of Weber, being organized during the following year. Except toward the north, the valley is surrounded by mountains, on which the snow lingers late into autumn, thus affording water for irri- gation throughout the year.

In Jan uary 1862 a site was selected and surveyed, the city in corporated,76 though yet unbuilt, and the people took possession of their lots. Before doing so it was decided by unanimous vote that the first building erected should be a social hall, to be used for educational and other pur poses.76 In September Brigham visited the settlers, and advised them to build, as soon as possible, a substan tial, commodious, and well-finished meeting-house, or tabernacle, large enough to seat at least two thousand persons, and one that would be an ornament to their city and a credit to their enterprise.

Black and others. Scipio, in the north-eastern part of the same county was settled in March 1860 by T. F. Robins and six others. Circleville, in what is now Piute co. , was settled about the same time, several previous attempts having failed, on account of trouble with Ind ians. In the same year, also, Fort Gunnison was founded in the south-western part of San Pete co. In 1861 it was organized as a ward, with Jacob Kudger son as bishop. About 30 miles to the north was Moroni, so called after the prophet of that name in the book of Mormon, located in March 1859 by G. W. Bradley and others, and incorporated in 1866. Fairview, farther to the north, and first known as North Bend, was founded in the winter of 1859 -60 by James N. Jones and others, and was incorporated iu 1872. Wales, the present terminus of the San Pete railway, was first settled in 1857 by John E. Rees and others, Rees being bishop of the ward in 1883; Fayette, on the west bank of the Sevier, but still in San Pete co., in 1S61, by James Bartholomew and four others, Bartholomew being now ward bishop. In Tooele co. , St John was founded in 1858 by Luke Johnson, and Lake View in 1860 by Orson Pratt, George Marshall, Moses Martin, aud four others, Martin being the present bishop. In Utah co., Spanish Fork, now on the line of the Utah Central rail road, was incorporated in 1855; Salem, alittle to the north-east of Payson, and . first known as Pond Town, was founded in 1850 by Robt Durfee and six others; and Goshen, in the south-western part of the county, in the same year by Phineas Cook and a few others. The present site of Goshen was located in 1869 by Brigham, a few miles south of the old settlement. In Weber county, Plain City was located in March 1859 on the Weber River, about nine miles north-west of Ogden, by J. Spiers and a few others; West Weber, a little farther south, about the same date, by Wm McFarland and 14 others; Eden, ten miles north-east of Ogden, in 1860, by John Beddle and Joseph Grover; and Huntsville, twelve miles east of Ogden, in the same year, by Jefferson Hunt and others.

They dif fered but little in outward appearance from the pio neer settlements in other parts of the United States, except in one particular. Throughout the entire ter ritory, there was rarely to be seen, except in Salt Lake City, a store or a mechanic's sign, traffic being carried on from house to house, and the few extraneous wants of the settlers being mainly supplied by peddlers.81 61 Among other works consulted in this chapter are the Route from Liver- pool to Great Salt Lake Valley: Illustrated with Steel Engravings and Wood-cuts from Sketches made by Frederick Piercy, together with a Geographical and His- torical Description of Utah, and a Map of the Overland Routes to that Temitory from the Missouri River.

Though this book was written mainly for the purpose of giving a review of the latter-day saints' emigration from Liverpool to Salt Lake City, together with statistics to date, it contains much historical and statistical information on other subjects, drawn, as the editor says, 'from sources far and wide.' Mr Linforth acknowledges that he was assisted in his work by missionaries, whose position and acquaintance with affairs gave him access to many valuable documents. In chap, xvii., we find a description of Nauvoo, of the Carthage- jail tragedy, the persecutions in Missouri and Illinois, and many details con- cerning the life of the prophet. In chaps xxi.-xxii. is an account of the territory and its settlements, and the industrial condition of the saints. In the last chapters are brief biographies of some of the leading elders. All of this information is contained in notes, the text merely relating the travels of the artists by whom the sketches were made. The engravings are well exe- cuted, and among them are portraits of several church dignitaries. A Journey to Great Salt Lake City, by Jules Remy and Julius Brenchley, M.

In addition to incidents of travel and de- scriptions of the places visited, we have in these volumes a sketch of Mor- mon history to 1859, together with chapters on the Mormon church and hierarchy, polygamy, education, and propagandism. At one time it was considered the standard gentile authority on Mormonism, and is freely quoted by other writers, though greatly inferior to Burton's work published two years later. 'The greater part of the matter,' remarks the author, 'was written from day to day, often in the open air, upon the slopes or the crests of mountains, in the heart of deserts, among the occupations and frequently the perils which are the necessary accompaniments of so long a journey.' Hence Mr Remy lays no claim to literary finish, a defect which he hopes may be atoned for by superior accuracy. Though there are many interesting passages and some interesting chapters, one cannot but feel that he might have said twice as much in half the space.

Crosby associate judges, Frank Fuller secretary, and James Duane Doty superin tendent of Indian affairs. A few weeks after his arrival, the governor was accused of making improper advances to one of the Mormon women, and on new year's eve of 1861 was glad to make his escape from Zion, being waylaid at Mountain Dell on his return journey and soundly beaten by a party of saints.2 1 After Cumming's departure, Secretary Wooton became acting governor, but resigned as soon as the southern secession was announced.

Waite, ap pointed in their stead, with Stephen S. Harding as governor, arriving in July. Meanwhile the secretary, by virtue of his office, became the chief magistrate.3 Now came an opportunity for Brigham to put forth once more the claim which he had several times as- serted : \" I am and will be governor.\" At this period another effort was being made to obtain admission as a state, and on the 17th of March, 1862, the legisla ture being then in session, a proclamation was issued, in which, styling himself governor-elect, Brigham convened the general assembly and ordered the elec tion of senators to congress.4 Soon afterward he telegraphed to Washington that no assistance was needed in subduing the Indians, who, as will presently appear, were somewhat troublesome at this date; for \"the militia were ready and able, as they had ever been, to take care of them, and were able and willing to protect the mail line if called upon to do so.\" Fuller meekly indorsed this statement, and was au thorized by the war department to call out ninety men for three months' service between forts Bridger and Laramie. General Wells was ordered to take command of the party, and in three days it was ready to march. The choice for senators fell on William H. Hooper and George Q. Cannon.

He was at once de spatched to Washington, with a memorial and consti tution of the inchoate state of Deseret, and Cannon, who was then in England, was instructed to join him without delay. The two elders labored diligently in their cause, but failed of success.5 It was claimed, however, on the part of the Mormons, that they won the respect of congress by accepting their defeat and adhering to the union at a time when it was believed throughout Europe that the war would result in favor of the south, and when the sympathies of England and France were strongly in favor of the southern states. Moreover, the attitude of the saints throughout this struggle, and especially the tone of their church organ, the Deseret News, were not adverse to the union cause. On the Sunday preced ing the surrender at Appomattox their prophet fore told in the tabernacle that there would be yet four years of civil war. Though the saints may have had some few friends in congress at this time, it is certain that they had numerous and bitter enemies, who were constantly working against their interests. In April 1862 a bill was introduced by Justin S.

Early in 1863 Waite drew up a bill amending the organic act, providing that juries be selected by the United States marshal, authorizing the governor to appoint militia officers, and restricting the powers of the probate courts to their proper functions, though with a limited criminal jurisdiction. The bill was approved by the governor and by Judge Drake, and, being forwarded to con gress, was referred to committee. On hearing of this measure, Brigham called a meeting at the tabernacle for the 3d of March, when many inflammatory speeches were made, and resolutions passed, condemning the governor's message and the action of the judges. A committee was appointed to wait on the officials and request their resignation, and. a petition drawn up requesting the president to remove them.17 To the committee, among whom was John Taylor, Drake replied: \"Go back to Brigham Young, your Utah.

Waite preferred to open court in May, and having occasion to examine the bill, found that the word 'May' had been erased and 'October' substituted. This had been done by a clerk in the house, and presumably by the order of members. The governor, who had inadvertently returned the bill, ordered the record corrected, and sent a message to the legislature, calling their at tention to the forgery. Issue was taken with him on the matter, one member producing a paper which, he averred, was the original draught, and where Oc tober was the month appointed. In the Deseret News, March 25, 1863, Waite is sharply censured for holding court in the third district, where he had no jurisdiction. 17 For copies of some of the speeches, the resolutions, and petition, see Waite 's The Mormon Prophet, 88-95; Tullidge's Hist.

Men gathered in groups at the street corners and discussed the matter with angry gestures; one of the judges was threatened with personal violence, and it is probable that an dmeute was only prevented by the fact that a party of California volunteers was now encamped near Salt Lake City. Ostensibly for protection against Indians, though in fact because the mail route and telegraph line were not considered secure in the hands of the saints, and perhaps also for the purpose of holding the territory under military surveillance, Colonel Connor was or- dered to Utah in May 1862, his command consisting of the third California infantry and a part of the second California cavalry, afterward joined by a few companies from Nevada, and mustering in all about seven hundred strong.

To this spot was given the name of Camp Douglas, the site being afterward declared a military reservation.22 The presence of the volunteers, though they were not sufficient in number to overawe the populace, and could have been readily annihilated by the Nauvoo legion, was a source of constant irritation.

On the same date Colonel Connor wrote to General Halleck, stating that the men had enlisted for the purpose of fighting traitors, that the infantry was of no service in the territory, as cavalry alone could act effectually against Indians, and there were enough men of that arm to protect the mail route. ' Brigham Young,' writes the colonel, 'offers to protect the entire line with 100 men. Why we were sent here is a mystery.

It was now believed that the first presidency was in danger;23 a flag was hoisted over Brigham's residence as a signal, and within an hour two thousand men were under arms, the prophet's dwelling being strongly guarded, scaffolding built against the surrounding walls, to enable the militia to fire down on the volun teers, and cannon planted on the avenues of approach. Night and day for several weeks armed men kept watch over the prophet, for it was now rumored that Connor intended to seize him at night and carry him off to Camp Douglas before the saints could rally to his aid.2* The citizens were instructed that, if the at- tempt were made, alarm guns would be fired from the hillside east of Brigham's residence. On the night of the 29th of March they were roused from sleep by the booming of cannon, and, as quickly as they could don their garments and seize their weapons, all ran forth from their homes, intent on exterminating the foe. As they rushed through the streets, the strains of martial music were heard, to which, as was sup posed, the troops were marching on Zion. The alarm was unfounded, the music and salute being in honor of the colonel's promotion to the rank of brigadier general, of which news had just arrived at Camp Douglas.

In Stenhouse's Rocky Mountain Saints, 607, it is related that one of the parties to whom Waite referred was a Mormon, who had recently married the three widows of a wealthy merchant in S. L. City. It was thought that this would furnish a good test of the law against polygamy. No arrest was made, however, as it was feared that difficulties might arise if Waite should try a case that lay within Kinney's jurisdiction. 21 Tho Mormons feared that Brigham might be taken to Washington for trial. For several days hundreds of men kept watch in and around his resi dence. Elders were also instructed to visit the various ward3 and warn the saints of the danger to person and property, from the lawless conduct of the troops.

Brigham was always strongly opposed to the sheddiugof blood, though he wished these men out of the city limits, on which the reservation slightly intrenched.25 The grand jury had al ready voted the camp a nuisance,'28 and on the ma)7 or devolved the duty of seeing it abated. But before taking action that official began to count the cost. To rid the city of the volunteers might be no difficult task, but if their blood was shed, others would come in tenfold numbers to take their place.27 By a little judicious delay the mayor gave time for the prophet's cooler judgment to assert itself, and thus averted an issue which might have resulted in the final dispersion of his people. The condition of affairs was now similar to that which had obtained during the presence of the army of Utah, Judge Kinney shielding the church digni taries from molestation by his colleagues, as Governor Cumming had done from the measures of judges Sin clair and Cradlebaugh. When it was believed that the arrest of Brigham was contemplated, on the ground that he had recently married another wife, the chief justice, as a safeguard, and at his own request, ordered him into custody for violating the act for the suppres sion of polygamy. The writ was served by the mar shal, without the aid of a posse, and the prisoner, at tended by a few intimate friends, promptly appeared at the state-house, where an investigation was held, 25 Though its centre was two and a half miles from the city hall, it lapped over the municipal boundary.

The troops were stationed near the head of the stream, but it was denied that they had beeu guilty of any such act, though doubtless the Mormons believed it. Later in the year there may have been cause for complaint, as the supply for irrigation was curtailed during the dry season. 27 When Connor heard of Brigham's order, he remarked to Stenhouse: 'I know, sir, that Brigham Young could use up this handful of men; but there are sixty thousand men in California who would avenge our blood.'

Although the prophet's recent marriage was well known throughout the city, and had long furnished food for gossip, the judges afterward refused to find a bill against him, on the ground that there was no sufficient evidence.23 During its session the grand jury indicted, for armed resistance to the laws, certain apostates known as Morrisites. In November 1860 an ignorant and simple-minded Welshman, Joseph Morris by name, made his way to the capital on foot, from an obscure settlement in Weber county. He had two letters, the contents of which were, as he claimed, inspired, their purport being to warn Brigham of his sin.29 His despatches were unheeded, or answered in befitting phrase,30 whereupon this new seer and revelator turned his face homeward. Reaching Kington Fort, on the Weber River, some thirty miles north of the city,31 he found favor with the bishop and certain of his neighbors, who embraced the new doctrine, believing that Morris was appointed by the Lord to deliver Is rael from bondage, and that the Lord's coming was nigh at hand. Other proselytes gathered from far and near, and all held their effects in common, for Christ was about to descend and would provide for his elect.32 28 In his Crit. Notes on Utah, MS., 18-20, Harrison states that the anti polygamy act was considered by the Mormons as directed mainly against Brigham Young and the heads of the church.

The witnesses were all his friends, among them being some of his own clerks, and he was simply bound over, to appear when called upon.

But the Lord tarried; and meanwhile provisions ran short and the enthusiasm of the converts began to wane, some desiring to withdraw, demanding a resti tution of their property, and refusing to contribute anything to the common stock, even for their own support. It was decided to let the dissenters go in peace; but some of them selected from the common herd the choicest cattle, and laying in wait for their brethren's teams, pounced on them while on their way to the mill laden with wheat. Three of the offenders were seized and imprisoned at Kington Fort, their friends in vain asking the interference of the sheriff and of Brigham. An appeal was then made to Judge Kinney, who at once issued warrants for the arrest of the Morrisite leaders, and writs of habeas corpus for the men held in custody. No heed was paid to these documents, for Morris had already appointed the day for the second advent, assuring his followers that there would no longer be seed time or harvest, and that meanwhile they had grain and cattle sufficient for their needs. Colonel Burton, sheriff of Salt Lake county, was then ordered to en force the writs, and on the 13th of June, 1862, ap peared on the heights above their camp at the Weber settlement with a posse of three hundred or four hun dred men and five pieces of artillery.

A moment later the report of artillery was heard, and two women were struck dead by a cannon-ball, the lower jaw of a young girl being shattered by the same shot. The firing was continued almost without intermission, the assailants opening with musketry as they approached the camp. At first the Morrisites, both men and women, took refuge in their cellars, or wherever else they could find cover, all being unarmed and the attack unex- pected; but presently, recovering from their panic, the men seized their weapons and organized for defence. The camp consisted mainly of tents and covered wagons, with a few huts built of willows, woven to- gether and plastered. Behind this frail protection the besieged maintained for three days an unequal fight, the cannon and long-range rifles of their assail- ants raking the enclosure,34 while their own weapons consisted only of shot-guns and a few Mexican fire- locks. At intervals Morris was besought to intercede with the Lord, but his only answer was: \"If it be his will, we shall be delivered, and our enemies destroyed; but let us do our duty.\" On the evening of the third day a white flag was raised, whereupon he exclaimed: \"Your faith has gone and the Lord has forsaken us. I can now do nothing more.\" After the surrender, the Morrisites were ordered to stack their arms, the men being separated from the women, and most of the former placed under arrest.

The account given in A Voice from tlie West, San Francisco, 1879, is written by one of the sect, and is purely from a Morrisite standpoint.

In a letter to Col Drum, asst adjt-general at San Fr.incisco, he writes: 'My policy in this territory has been to invite hither a large gentile and loyal pop- ulation, sufficient by peaceful means and through the ballot-box to overwhelm the Mormons by mere force of numbers, and thus wrest from the church \u2014 dis- loyal and traitorous to the core \u2014 the absolute and tyrannical control of tem- poral and civil affairs.' The Daily Telegraph, the first number of which appeared July 4, 18G4, with T. B. H. Stenhouse as editor and proprietor, waged fierce war with the Vedette, which was issued at Camp Douglas in Jan. 1864, as a daily paper. Early in 1S65 Gen. Connor stopped its publication.

Though his party was strongly op posed to Mormonism, Lincoln had little to say on the so-called Mormon question, and that little was ex pressed in three words: Let them alone. To be left alone was all that the people asked and all that they had struggled for, since Utah was first admitted as a territory. The occasion was therefore one of rejoicing, honest and heart-felt, and the pageant more imposing than anything that had yet been witnessed in the city of the saints.68 In the centre of Main Street a plat form was erected, and here, on the morning of the 4th of March, the federal officers, civil and military, ex changed greetings with the church dignitaries. Past them filed a procession of tradesmen and working men, a mile in length, the sidewalks, the windows, and house-tops being crowded with an eager and bois terous throng. The buildings were draped with flags, the carriages and sleighs decorated with streamers, the men and women with rosettes, while the bands of the 3d infantry and. the Nauvoo legion furnished music, and Mormon banners, with their manifold de vices, appeared side by side with the stars and stripes. Later the concourse assembled in front of the stand, the provost guard69 facing the platform, the militia companies forming in the rear, and the volunteers drawn up on their right, four deep and with arms at rest. Addresses were delivered, the bands playing and the multitude cheering lustily during the intervals. The troops were then escorted to their camp by the cavalry of the legion, and General Connor and his staff tended for secular news and for general circulation, though friendly in its tone toward the saints.

A few weeks after this gala-day citizens and sol diers again united in fraternal gathering to mourn the loss of their president.61 When news of his assassina tion was first received, the volunteers could with dif ficulty be controlled from venting their fury on the in habitants, who, as they imagined, were exulting over this deed of infamy. Soon, however, they were forced to acknowledge themselves in error, for Lincoln had ever been friendly toward the Mormons, and by none was he more respected. On the 19th of April, the day set apart for the funeral solemnities at Washing ton, business was suspended in Salt Lake City; the flags on the public buildings were hung at half-mast and covered with crape; many of the stores and resi dences were dressed in mourning, and long before the appointed hour more than three thousand persons, among them being many gentiles, were assembled at the tabernacle.

Soon after the departure of Connor, orders were received to disband the volunteers; but the alarm caused among gentile citizens by further Mormon troubles caused a portion of them to be retained until they could be replaced by regular troops. Of the many crimes laid to the charge of the saints at this period, and by some ascribed to the agency of the church, the murders of Newton Brassfield and King Robinson were the most notorious.62 In the spring of 1866 Brassfield, formerly a citizen of Cali fornia and more recently of Nevada, married the wife of one of the elders, then employed on a foreign mission. Application was made and granted for a writ of habeas corpus to obtain possession of the children, the case being still pending when the assas sination occurred. On the 2d of April he was shot dead by some unknown person while about to enter his hotel.63 A reward of $4,500 was offered by the 62 Gen.

The doctor was an intimate friend of Norman McLeod, and at the time of his assassination a superinten dent of the gentile Sunday-school.66 While at Camp Douglas, he ascertained that certain ground in the neighborhood of Warm Springs was unoccupied, and supposing it to be a portion of the public domain, took possession of it, and erected a building thereon. The city council claimed that the land belonged to the corporation, and ordered the marshal to destroy the improvements and eject the claimant.

The murder was committed at a corner of Main Street in bright moonlight, the doctor's cries were heard by his neighbors, and seven persons were seen running away from the spot, but no arrests were made,6s the verdict of the coroner's jury being that the deceased had died by the hands of parties un known.69 By the gentiles the doctor's assassination was attributed to his contest with the city authori ties, though in fact the murder may have been neither ordered nor premeditated. If it were so, it would seem improbable that seven persons should have been intrusted with the secret, and that such time and place should have been selected.

A school was to be maintained for ten years, during nine months in the year; grist and lumber mills and mechanics' shops were to be built and equipped at the expense of the government, and $7,000 voted annually for ten years in aid of various industries. The Indians were to be protected on their reservation; must not make war except in self defence ; and must not steal, or if they did, the stolen memorial, in Laws of Utah, 1878, p. 167. Geo. W.

On the 30th of July, 1863, a treaty had been made with Pocatello and others whereby the roads to the Beaver Head and Bois6 River gold mines and the northern California and southern Oregon roads were made secure.

In his message to the legislature, dated Dec. 12, 1864, Gov. Doty remarks: ' These are the first treaties ever made by the U. S. with the bands of Shoshones; and it is somewhat remarkable that they have adhered to their stipulations with a fidelity equal to that of most civilized nations. ' Utah Jour. Legist, 1864-5, pp. 11-12. 84 The appropriations were to be made on the supposition that the Indian tribes would muster 5,000 souls, and were to be increased or diminished in proportion to their numbers.

In 1864 a memorial had been presented by the Utah legislature, asking that the Indians be removed from their smaller reservations,86 and in the same year acts were passed by congress authorizing the appoint ment of a surveyor-general for Utah, providing that the Indian title to agricultural and mineral lands be extinguished, and the lands laid open to settlement, ordering the superintendent of Indian affairs to col lect as many of the tribes as possible in the Uintah Valley, and appropriating for agricultural improve ments the sum of $30,000.87 The site was well selected, being remote from routes and settlements, and enclosed by mountain ranges, which were im passable for loaded teams during nine or ten months in the year. It contained at least two millions of acres,88 portions of it being well adapted for agricul ture and grazing, and was well supplied with timber and water-power. In the summer of 1868 about 130 acres were under cultivation, and it was estimated that the value of the produce would reach $15,000; but on the 1st of July swarms of grasshoppers settled 85 A synopsis of the provisions of this treaty, which was negotiated by 0.

The salary of the surveyor general was to be $3,000 a year, and his powers and duties similar to those of the surveyor-general of Oregon. The usual school reservations were made. By act of July 16, 1868, it was ordered that the public lands of the territory should constitute a new land district, to be named the Utah district, and that the preemption, homestead, and other laws of the U. S. should be ex tended over it. Id., 973^4. In 1862 this district was merged with that of Colorado. U. S. Acts, 37th Cong. 2d Sess., 51, 100-1. In Ind. Aff. Rept, 1864, p. 16, Commissioner Wm P.

In other years the result was fairly encouraging, when it is considered that the Indian is by nature a hunter, averse to all manual labor, and subsists mainly on meat.

Deseret News, Aug. 26, 1868. Among the most recent works on Utah is The History of Salt Lake City and its Founders, by Edward W. 1'ullidge. The first volume, which is a re print from Tullidge's Quarterly Magazine, was issued in 1884, and relates the leading incidents of Mormon history between 1845 and 1865, the purpose being to continue it to a more recent date, adding thereto the records of other towns and counties, and forming when completed a history of the entire ter ritory. The work is somewhat in the nature of a compilation, and consists largely of copies of official reports and documents, together with numerous extracts from other works, more especially from Stenhouse's Rocky Mountain Saints. Mr Tullidge follows the text of Stenhouse very closely in portions of his work, though writing from a different standpoint, and sometimes borrows his language with very slight alterations and without acknowledgment. The chapters relating to the Utah war occupy a large portion of the first volume. They are carefully considered, and contain much that is not found elsewhere. The work is published by authority of the city council, and under supervision of its committee on revision. The Rocky Mountain Saints: A Full and Complete History of the Mormons, from the First Vision of Joseph Smith to the Last Courtship of Brigham Young, by T'. B. H. Stenhouse. New York, 1873. This work, as its title indicates, carries the story of Mormonism from its earliest inception up to within a few years of the death of Brigham. Besides giving a complete outline of the political history of the latter-day saints, it contains chapters on the Mormon theocracy and priesthood, on polygamy, and on the book of Mormon, together with descriptions of the domestic and social condition of the Mormons, and of the various outrages commonly ascribed to them, more especially of the Moun tain Meadows massacre. The book is profusely illustrated, entertaining in style, and though containing 761 pages of printed matter, can be read with interest throughout. The author was for 25 years a Mormon missionary and elder, during which period he was on familiar terms with the apostles, and for twelve years held daily intercourse with the president of the church. As he relates, he 'has no pet theories to advance, no revelations to announce, no personal animosity to satisfy. He has simply outgrown the past.' Though at times unduly severe, it is in the main one of the most impartial works yet published by anti-Mormon writers. Stenhouse, a Scotchman by birth, was converted to Mormonism in 1846, being then 21 years of age. He afterward labored as a missionary in England, Scotland, and various parts of Europe,"], [691, "BOOKS ON UTAH. 637 founding the Southampton conference, and being for three years president of the Swiss and Italian missions. In 1869 he apostatized, and soon afterward removed to the city of New York, where he found employment as a journal ist and wrote the above work. His decease occurred in 1882. See Stenhouse's Tell It A 11, preface; Burton's Rocky Mountain Saints, 272; S. F. Bulletin, March 7, 1882. Expose\" of Polygamy in Utah: A Lady's Life among the Mormons, by Mrs T. B. H. Stenhouse. New York, 1872. Tell It All: The Story of a Life's Ex perience in Mormonism. An Autobiography; by Mrs T. B. II. Stenhouse. Hartford, Conn., 1879. An Englishwoman in Utah: The Story of a Life's Experience in Mormonism. An Autobiography; by Mrs T. B. H. Stenhouse. London, 1S80. The last two of these works are almost identical, except that one or two chapters of the former are omitted in the latter volume. Begin ning with her first introduction to Mormonism about the year 1849, until the date of her own and her husband's apostasy, some 20 years later, the authoress gives what is claimed to be a plain, unvarnished record of facts which have come under her own notice. A few months after the publication of the Exposi of Polygamy, Mrs Stenhouse was asked to lecture on that subject, and wherever she spoke was requested to give her narrative more circumstantially and in more detail. Finally she accepted the suggestion of a gentile newspaper, published at S. L. City, to 'tell it all.' Hence the title and subject-matter of this work. Though claiming no literary merit, it is well told, and certainly tells enough, while containing nothing that can be termed positively indeli cate. The Mormon Prophet and his Harem: or, An Authentic History of Brigham Young, his Numerous Wives and Children, by Mrs C. V. Waite. Cambridge, 18G6. Apart from the opening chapter, which contains the early life of Brig- ham, the first half of this work is devoted to the political history of Utah. Its main interest centres, however, in the information given in the latter por- tion, as to the family and social relations of the Mormon leader. There is the inevitable chapter on polygamy, written, the authoress remarks, as dispassion- ately as the writer's utter abhorrence of the system will permit. There is also a chapter where the mysteries of the endowment house are described in the form of a burlesque, and others where Brigham is set forth as prophet, seer, revelator, and grand archee. The volume is compact and well written; but though many of the facts may have been gathered, as is claimed, from original sources, they contain little that is not well known at the present day. Life in Utah: or. The Mysteries and Crimes of Mormonism, being an Expose of the Sacred Rites and Ceremonies of the Latter-Day Saints, with a Full and Authentic History of Polygamy and the Mormon Sect from its Origin to the Present Time, by J. H. Beadle. Philadelphia, etc., 1870. Though the author claims to have had access to valuable personal records and other private sources of information, his book has no special value. There are chapters on Mormon society, Mormon theology and theocracy, Mormon mysteries, theoretical and practical polygamy, but all these matters have beeu better treated by others, while the historical portions of the work are far inferior to those of Stenhouse. In relating the crimes of the Mormons, Mr Beadle claims that the statements for and against them have beeu equally presented. The reader need only turn to his account of the Mountain Meadows massacre to find that this is not the case. Here, and elsewhere, in the usual vein of looseness and exaggera- tion, crimes are alleged against the saints that have never been sustained, and all extenuating circumstances are omitted. Murders are laid to their charge of which there is no evidence, and which are not even mentioned by the leading authorities. The volume forms one of the many works that have been written on Mormonism with a view to pander to the vicious tastes of a certain class of readers rather than to furnish information.

During the life-time of Joseph Smith there was but one organized secession from the church, though, as we have seen, apostasies were frequent during his later years. If the words of the prophet were not the living truth, then could no faith be placed in Mormonism, for he and none other was regarded as the fountain-head of inspiration. But with his death the source of infallibility was removed, and thus the way was opened for schism and dissension, few of the diverging sects, however, having sufficient faith in their leaders to preserve them from final dissolution. The saints who followed Sidney Rigdon to Pitts- burgh in 1844 became gradually scattered among the gentiles, a few of them, with William Marks at their head, afterward rejoining the church. To J. J. Strang, a prominent elder, were vouchsafed, as he claims, numerous revelations that in Wisconsin was the true Zion, and several thousands accompanied him to that state. Strang afterward settled at Beaver Island, in Lake Michigan, where he retained a sinall Hist. Utah, m ( 641 )"], [696, "SCHISMS AND APOSTASIES. 642 following until the time of his death. Parties^ also accompanied William Smith, the only surviving brother of the prophet, to northern Illinois, Elder Brewster to western Iowa, Bishop Heddrick to Mis souri, and Bishop Cutler to northern Iowa. All of them were soon afterward dissolved, the remnants of Brewster's and Heddrick's disciples forming them selves into a new sect, under the name of the Gath erers, and settling in Jackson county, where they published a weekly periodical, styled the Truthteller. During the year 1846 a large Mormon settlement was made in Texas; and under the leadership of Apostle Lyman Wight the colony prospered and increased rapidly. Until 1852 they acknowledged allegiance to the first presidency, but when the doctrine of polyg amy was proclaimed, they separated from the church. After the death of Wright, which occurred a few years later, his flock was scattered. A small portion of the members of most of these sects found their way to Salt Lake City, while others joined the reor ganized church, as will be mentioned later, and the remainder cast in their lot with the gentiles. Of the party that sailed with Brother Sam. Bran nan for California, in the Brooklyn, in 1846, about one fourth apostatized; their leader laying the basis of a fine fortune by investing in real estate funds, to a great extent at least, belonging to the Latter-day Saints.1 Of the Mormon colony, founded, as we have seen, at San Bernardino, in 1851, a considerable num ber fell into apostasy, though many joined the parent organization, and a few became members of the reor ganized church. In addition to the various sects already mentioned and to be mentioned, numerous parties and individ- 1 Beadle, Life in Utah, 404-5, states that Brannan afterward repaid the money with interest, but it would be difficult to make the early Californians believe it. About 45 adults and 65 children of the Brooklyn party remained in California, a few afterward joining Mormon communities at San Bernardino or in Arizona. Nearly 100 adults and some 40 children reached Utah, most of them in 1S1S-50. See Hist. Cat. v. 544, this series."], [697, "THE GLADDENITES. 643 uals fell away during the migration from Nauvoo, many of the stakes becoming settlements of recusant Mormons, while numbers of the saints settled at Omaha, Nebraska City, and other towns on the Mis souri and its tributaries. Some, as I have said, merely remained in the western states to obtain means for their journey to Zion, but of the twenty thousand persons who followed the apostles from Nauvoo, it is probable that nearly one third were eventually ab sorbed among gentile communities. In Utah, between 1852 and 1869, four distinct and organized attempts were made to throw off the yoke of Brigham, and establish what the apostates claimed to be a more perfect faith. These were the Gladdenite secession in 1852, the Josephite schism in 1860, the Morrisite movement in 1861, and the Godbe-Harrison schism in 1869. When the doctrine of polygamy was openly avowed in 1852, some of the saints were sorely offended, and accusing the hierarchy of having fallen from grace in other respects, formed themselves into a new sect, ap- pointing as their leader Gladden Bishop, whence the name of Gladdenites. Together with other recusants, Gladden, who was several times disfellowshipped and readmitted on profession of repentance, had again re joined the church,2 but being now disgusted with this new feature in the policy of the church dignitaries, worked with heart and soul against them. Among his followers was one Alfred Smith from St Louis, a man of great tenacity of purpose, and a bitter foe of Brigham, by whom, as he alleged, he had been stripped of his property. For a time the cause flour ished, but on Sunday, the 20th of March, 1853, while Smith was holding services in front of the council house, the gathering, though orderly and peaceable, was dispersed by the city marshal. Another meet- \"Ferris states that Gladden was cut off and rebaptized nine times. Utmh and the Mormons, 326. See also Olshausen, Mormonen, 182."], [698, "644 SCHISMS AND APOSTASIES. S ing called for the following sabbath was dispersed, Smith being taken into custody, and detained until he promised to desist. On the same day Brigham spoke a few words concerning the apostates in the tabernacle. The whole matter was regarded of no great consequence by the church ; nevertheless it was deemed best to shun the very appearance of evil, and consequently the president gave the people clearly to understand that there must be no more of it.3 Such warnings from the president of the church were never uttered in vain, and now the days of the Gladdenites were numbered. A few months later most of them set forth for California, the rest recanted, and after the year 1854 we hear no more of this apostasy. The most successful of the recusant sects was the one established by Joseph Smith, the prophet's son, who, with his brothers Alexander H. and David Jlj rum, remained at Nauvoo after the exodus.4 A few years later the remnants of the Strangites and Cutler ites, being in search of a leader, organized a new church and requested Joseph to become their head. He at first refused, but in 1860, the number of members being then considerably increased by the breaking-up of other parties, he accepted the call as prophet, and began to preach the faith of his father, as he affirmed, in its original purity, repudiating the claims of Brigham and the doctrine of polygamy. The schism spread rapidly throughout Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa, the apostates being termed Josephites by the followers of Brigham, but styling themselves the Reorganized 'Jour, of Disc, i. 82; Deseret News, Apr. 2, 1853; Waite's The Mormon Prophet, 120-1; Beadle's Life in Utah, 408-9; Ferris, Utah and the Mormons, 328-30. Brigham was followed by Parley Pratt, who said that he had known Gladden for 20 years, and had Beldom heard his name mentioned, except in connection with some imposition or falsehood in the name of the Lord. 4 Beadle says that the prophet left a considerable fortune, mostly in houses and lands at Nauvoo.

Church of Latter-day Saints. In Utah it was checked by fear of persecution, and not until the summer of 1863 did the movement become pronounced. In July of that year two Josephite missionaries, named E. C. Bricrrrs ancl Alexander McCord, arrived in Salt Lake City, having crossed the plains, they said, as heralds of the gospel, and calling on Brigham, told him the object of their mission, and asked permission to preach in the tabernacle. This was, of course, refused;5 nor were they allowed the use of any other public build ing, whereupon the missionaries visited from house to house, offering up prayers for the inmates, and ex horting them to join the true faith. At first singly, then by dozens, and afterward by scores, converts were gathered into this fold, and in the spring of 1864 the Josephites in Zion mustered more than three hundred, the number of proselytes elsewhere being at this date between two and three thousand.\" Persecution followed, as they claimed; and in early summer about one half of the Josephites in Salt Lake City started eastward, so great being the excitement that General Connor ordered a strong es cort to accompany them as far as Green River. To those who remained protection was also afforded by the authorities. The excitement caused by the evangelism of Briggs and McCord was renewed in the summer of 1869, when Alexander H. and David Hyrum Smith arrived at Salt Lake City as advocates of the reformed faith. Their meetings were held at Independence Hall, then the principal public building belonging to the gentiles, and at the first service a vast audience assembled, among the number being several of the wives of Brigham. At first the followers of Brigham trembled 'In Waite's The Mormon Prophet, 129, it is stated that Brigham said he would not be responsible for Briggs' safety if he remained in the city. \u2022Bowles, Our New West, 26S, his work being published in 1869, incorrectly places the entire number at 1,500. In Waite's The Mormon Prophet, 128 (published in 1S66), we read: ' In the states, those who have gone back to their first love are to be numbered by thousands.'"], [700, "SCHISMS AND APOSTASIES. 646 for the supremacy of their leader, and opposition meetings were organized under the management of Joseph F., the son of Hyrum Smith.7 But the mantle of the prophet had not fallen on his offspring; they were men almost without force of character, of lamb-like placidity, and of hopelessly mediocre ability ; not shrewd enough to contend with their opponents, and not violent enough to arouse the populace. They accomplished little for the cause of the reorganized church. In 1860 the headquarters of the Josephites were established at Piano, Illinois, where, between 1860 and 1875, was published by this sect The True Latter day Saint's Herald, and where in 1877 their leader stiil resided,8 Joseph being at that date president of the church, and Briggs the president of the twelve. A branch was also established at Malad in Idaho; a few of the sect gathered at Kirtland,9 and the re mainder were scattered throughout the states. They rapidly increased, mustering in 1870 not less than twenty thousand in the United States, while in Europe entire churches joined the reformed faith, the name of the sect, and the more conventional morality of its doctrines, being among the causes of its success.10 ' Stenhouse says that debates between the two parties were held in public. Rocky Mountain Saints, 629 (note). 'S. Lake Herald, June 6, 1877. 'Ibid.; McClure's Three Thousand Miles, 435. 10The Josephite creed will be found in Waite's The Mormon Prophet, 130 1; Utah Scraps, 16. It contains the following: 'We believe that the church in Utah, under the presidency of Brigham Young, have apostatized from the true order of the gospel. We believe that the doctrines of polygamy, human sacrifice, or killing men to save them, Adam being God, Utah being Zion, or the gathering place for the saints, are doctrines of devils.' In other respects their creed was almost identical with the Mormon articles of faith. Codman, who attended their services, remarks: 'They use the same religious books in their worship, and argue from them the prohibition of polygamy with as much earnestness as Orson Pratt displays in its advocacy.' The Round Trip, 210. The second Joseph Smith, junior, was born at Kirtland Nov. 6, 1832. His early life was spent in Missouri and Illinois, whither he went with his parents. F. G. Mather received a letter from him in 1879, saying: 'lam now pretty widely recognized as the leader of that wing of the Mormon church declaring positive Mormonism, but denying and opposing polygamy and Utah Mormonism.' I give herewith a copy of an inscription on one of the pillars of the temple at Kirtland, as reported by Mather, Lippineott's"], [701, "THE GODBEITES. 647 While the controversy between the prophet's sons and the prophet's nephew was at its height, an article appeared in the Utah Magazine, a periodical firstissued in 1867, and of which elders W. S. Godbe and E. L. T. Harrison were proprietors, wherein appeared the following passage : \"If we know the true feeling of our brethren, it is that they never intend Joseph Smith's nor any other man's son to preside over them simply because of their sonship. The principle of heirship has cursed the world for ages, and with our brethren we expect to fight it till, with every other relic of tyranny, it is trodden under foot.\" While speaking thus boldly, the magazine essayed the part of umpire between the disputants, and otherwise gave sore offence to the church dignitaries.11 About the same time an article was published urging the devel opment of the mineral resources of Utah, a measure which found no favor with Brigham, for thus would the flood-gates be opened to the gentiles, while the saints might be tempted to worship at the shrine of Mammon. \"I want to make a wall so thick and so high around the territory,\" he once exclaimed in the tabernacle, \"that it would be impossible for the gen tiles to get over or through it.\"12 Finally the elders were summoned before the school of prophets, by Mag., Aug. 1880. 'The Salt Lake Mormons. When Joseph Smith was killed on June 27, 1844, Brigham Young assumed the leadership of the church, telling the people in the winter of 1840 that all the God they wanted was him, and all the bible they wanted was in his heart. He led or drove about two thousand people to Utah in 1S47, starting for upper Calif ornia and landing at Salt Lake, where in 1S52 Brigham Young presented the polygamic revelation to the people. The true church remained disorganized till 1860, when Joseph Smith took the leadership or presidency of the church at Ainboy, Illinois. We [thirty thousand] have no affiliation with the Mormons whatever. They are to us an apostate people, working all manner of abomination before God aud man.

This was in fact a most essential part of the policy in ac cordance with which the Mormons had sought for seclusion in the vales of Deseret, in order to preserve their liberty and individuality as a religious commu nity. From the day when news arrived of the gold discovery, their leaders had denounced all emigration to California. Gold-seekers were indiscriminately classed as worldlings and apostates, or at least held to be weak in the faith. Nevertheless, the accounts received from members of the Mormon battalion, who had witnessed the discovery and shared in the excite ment which followed it, produced a crisis that threat ened their very existence as a people, and one which, perhaps, none but the Mormons could have withstood. When, in later years, mineral prospects were disclosed in Utah, and prospecting largely carried on by gen tiles, all such efforts were discouraged ; for they could result only in drawing into the territory a class of men dangerous to its institutions, and might even se duce from their allegiance the members of the church. Thus in the light of its full history must the policy of the Mormon hierarchy be considered in excluding from its fold this disturbing element. No attempt was made, however, by either of the elders to excuse this portion of the charges brought against them. Their defence was confined merely to the question of their alleged apostasy, and to the au- u Ibid.; Harrison's Crit.

When their case was handed to the high council, the recusants, instead of pleadiug their cause, merely read a series of resolutions touch ing measures of church reform, Godbe denying Brig ham's right to enforce obedience, whether in matters secular or spiritual, and Harrison stating that if it was apostasy to differ conscientiously from the priest hood, then he must be considered an apostate. \"We claim,\" they said, \"the right of respectfully but freely discussing all measures upon which we are called to act. And if we are cut off from this church for asserting this right, while our standing is dear to us, we will suffer it to be taken from us sooner than re- sign the liberties of thought and speech to which the gospel entitles us ; and against any such expulsion we present our solemn protest before God and angels.\" It remained only to pass sentence of excommunication, and in due form the elders were delivered over to the buffetings of Satan for a thousand years. But a few days later there appeared in the Utah Magazine an account of the trial, together with a pro- test and appeal to the brethren, afterward copied in the New York Herald and other leading journals. \"It had been argued,\" remarked the recusants, \" that we must passively and uninquiringly obey the priest- hood, because otherwise we could not build up Zion.

Zion's standard is unfurled; The dawning of a brighter day Majestic rises on the world. Then followed speeches by Godbe, Harrison, and Lawrence, in which the gentiles, who formed one-third of the audience, were assured that the reformation would be continued with a purpose that would swerve not before Brigham and his apostles. The so-called Godbeite movement, however, though for a time it excited considerable interest in business circles, was a matter of small moment to the church generally, producing little effect on the masses of the members. The movement in its incipiency was the immediate occasion rather than the real cause of Godbe and his adherents leaving the church. No man can consistently be continued a member of any church if he persists in refusing to submit to the final decisions of the church authorities. His arrival at that point of insubordination is almost always the result of a growth of greater or less rapidity, and occupying more or less time in development. Godbeism at first professed to be an attempt to reform and purify the church, in part by the aid of spiritualism, but the reform pretensions were evanescent, quickly fading away, so that for many years nobody has looked upon the movement as a religious one in any respect. In fact with the fleeting religious pretensions the very name of the movement soon died out, and the promi nent persons connected with it early manifested a skep tical spirit toward religion of every kind, and directed their energies more completely into channels of busi ness and money-making. \" I have been instru mental,\" writes Godbe in 1884, \"in establishing and conducting enterprises that have required an outlay of \"For account of secret, benefit, and benevolent societies in Utah see Utah Gazetteer, 1884, 218-26.

Among the Mormons there were few men of business training, and until the advent of the overland railroad made it certain that Salt Lake City would become a com mercial centre, the policy of Brigham was to discour age commerce and commercial intercourse. Never theless, gentile merchants, by whom traffic was mainly conducted, as late as 1860 were subject to a running fire of ridicule and condemnation directed against them from the tabernacle. The objection to them was twofold : first, the dislike to the presence of gen tiles, in whatever capacity; and second, the fact that they absorbed the small amount of floating capital that the brethren possessed. He who should hold traffic with a gentile was considered weak in the faith, but as goods could be purchased from gentile mer- \"Godbe's Statement, MS., 29.

Godbe, an Englishman by birth, began his career as a sailor; but after being twice shipwrecked, tired of seafaring life, and while yet a lad, betook himself to America. Having made the acquaintance of several Mormons, and being charmed with the story of their adventures, he decided to cast in his lot with them, and journeyed nearly the whole distance on foot between New York and Salt Lake City, where he arrived in 1851, and found employment with a merchant named Thomas Williams, in a few years be- coming himself a leading merchant. Between 1857 and 1S84 Mr Godbe crossed the Atlantic 21 times, and the plains over 50 times. After his ex- communication from the church, and the consequent loss of his business, find- ing himself, as he says, $100,000 in debt, whereas a year before he had been worth $100,000, he followed mining as an occupation, and in 1S73 organized iu London the Chicago Silver Mining Co., one of the few English companies that have proved successful iu Utah. Of his ventures in mining, mention will be made later. Of Mr Harrison, he remarks that he is 'a man of unusual mental qualities, of earnest nature, and has an overruling love of truth, hon- esty, and straightforwardness.'

'They don't make many converts in the United States,' he remarks; 'they don't look for them.

Among those who had transactions with gentile mer chants were the Walker Brothers, who in 1868 were among the prominent merchants of Salt Lake City, and had contributed in no small degree to its commercial prosperity. The firm subscribed liberally for all the purposes to which the church funds were applied, but refused to pay tithes or to recognize the right of the church to collect tithing.17 During this year, and partly with a view to placing the trade of Utah under church control, so far at least as the brethren were concerned, the Zion's Coopera tive Mercantile Institution was organized.18 Aside from such motives, however, there were good reasons for securing to the country the benefits of the co operative system, for, as we shall see later, the prices of imported commodities were still extravagantly high.19 To protect the people from these high prices by importing frDm first hands and in large quantities was the professed, and perhaps the main, purpose of the promoters. After passing through some financial difficulties, the enterprise seems to have obtained a permanent foothold, and is yet a successful competitor with gentile tradesmen, supplying at wholesale many of the settlements in Utah, in addition to its local and retail trade. In 1883 the total sales exceeded $4,000,000, a half-yearly dividend of five per cent be ing paid in October of that year. At this date the association had a reserve fund of about $125,000, and \" Walker's Merchants and Miners of Utah, MS., 2. 18 On the 16th of October.

In connection with it, it may be mentioned that Horace S. Eldredge, who has been connected with the institute from its inception, was appointed president in 1872, and in 1884 was superin tendent. Mr Eldredge, a native of New York, arrived in Utah in 1848, after passing through all the tribulations of Far West, Nauvoo, and Winter Quar ters. In 1868, being theu in partnership with H. B. Clawson, he sold out his stock of goods to the institute. Hiram B. Clawson, a native of Oneida co., N. Y., was educated at the Utica academy. In 1841, his father being then deceased, and the rest of the family having joined the Mormon church, he moved with them to Nauvoo, and in 1848 to the valley of Great Salt Lake. Though only 22 years of age, he was looked upon as a man of mark, and was employed in superintending the construction of some of the first buildings erected by the church in Salt Lake City. During the Utah war he figured prominently as adjutant-general of the Nauvoo legion, and just before the departure of the troops from Camp Floyd effected a complete reconciliation between the military and the church authorities. Appointed superintendent of Zion's Cooperative Mercantile In stitute, in 1873 he was sent east in company with H. S. Eldredge to ask for an extension of credit, in view of the panic then prevailing in commercial circles. He met everywhere with a favorable response, and within eight months the company redeemed its obligations, amounting to SI, 100,000. Dur ing his management Mr Clawson states that the losses of the institution by bad debts did not exceed a quarter of one per cent. In 1875 he resigned the superintended}', having purchased from the directors the agricultural depart ment of the Z. C. M. I., to which he added a machinery department, furnish ing grist and saw mills and steam-engines complete, together with all the different kinds of machines commonly in use throughout the territory.

Hence, per haps, as will presently appear, the rapid development of the mining resources of the country after 1869, toward which purpose several prominent merchants, among them Godbe and the Walker Brothers, applied the remnants of their fortunes. Soon, however, even the Mormons began to disregard the warnings of their leaders against trading with gentiles or apostates. The spell was broken, and during the conference of 1870 the stores of the latter, and especially of the Walker Brothers, were so crowded with purchasers that it was almost impossible for them to serve their patrons.

A memorial was also prepared and forwarded to congress, setting forth the revelation on polygamy and the duties of the Mormon church in that connection, wherein it was declared that the church would stand by its faith and polygamy institu tions in spite of all human will and law.4 During this year, also, an act was passed by the territorial legislature, granting the right of suffrage to women, but the measure subsequently adopted in Wyoming and elsewhere seemed to be in advance of the times,6 or was in some way unpopular, and little use has ever been made of the privilege.8 Among those who realized the danger of the situa tion were the leaders of the Godbeite movement, who well knew that, in the event of another Mormon war, the dramatic farce of Buchanan's administra tion could not be reenacted, and that if the United States government again entered into the contro versy, it would never withdraw from it until it had cut with its sword the Gordian knot of Mormonism. 2 For debate and amendments when the bill passed the representatives, see Cong.

It was resolved by the leaders of the Godbeite faction that William Godbe should proceed to Washington and state to the president the true condition of affairs. \"Mr Godbe,\" remarked the latter, after listening to his arguments, \"I am as solicitous as you can possibly be to preserve the Mormon people;\" and then he de clared that he would save them from their leaders by checkmating their policy. During his visit Godbe also sought an interview with Cullom, and discussed with him the provisions of the bill, section by section, pleading his cause with such warmth and earnestness that all the animus of the congressman gave way, and the bill was not brought up for action in the senate. The substance of the policy recommended by the emissary of the liberal party in Utah was to establish over Utah a firm and efficient federal rule, rather than resort to special legislation or armed interference ; and in these views the president heartily concurred.

To this the general replied that he was perfectly agreed ; that it would be the best thing for all if the territory, its governor, legislature, municipalities, and militia, were left to themselves; and that if the troops had also been left alone, instead of being poisoned physically with bad whiskey and morally with bad influences, there would have been no trouble with them. Both letters were published in the Deseret News,n and of course drew forth much comment from the saints, who were prob ably of opinion that, if the soldiers had such procliv ities, it was at least the business of their commanding officer to restrain them. No further incident remains to be chronicled as to the career of Governor Shaffer, whose decease oc curred in October 1870,12 his successor being Vernon H. Vaughan,13 a mild and conservative ruler, con cerning whose brief administration there is nothing worthy of record.1* To him succeeded George L. Woods, a Missourian by birth, a pronounced anti- Mormon, and one who, as a ferryman in Idaho,15 and judge and politician in eastern Oregon, had accumu lated and lost a considerable fortune.

M. Hawley of Illinois and O. F. Strickland of Michigan as associate judges.16 The administration of Governor Woods lasted for about four years, but during that period he sought no opportunity of making the acquaintance of Brig ham Young. When invited by the first councillor to call, as had been the custom with his predecessors,17 he replied that the lowest subordinate in the United States ranked higher than any ecclesiastic on earth, and that he should not call until the president first called on him. The reader may judge the chief magistrate by his own words. \"My first conflict with the church occurred,\" he says, \"July 4, 1871. The organic act of the territory made the governor com mander-in-chief of the militia. The Mormon legis lature, prior to that time, usurped that authority, and invested it in Daniel H. Wells, the third in the church. (They had a pantomime, in which B. Young played God the Father, Daniel H. Wells God the Son, and John H. Smith the Holy Ghost.) That law was in force on my arrival. On July 1, 1871, Wells issued an order as commander-in-chief to the militia of the territory to assemble at Salt Lake City July 4th to participate in the celebration. I resented this usurpation, and forbade them to assemble, but my prohibition was disregarded. Thereupon I or dered to the rendezvous three companies of infantry, one of cavalry, and a battery of artillery, and dispersed them at the point of the bayonet.

The president's health was feeble at this time, and on the application of his attorney, a continuance was granted until the March term. One Thomas Hawkins, however, was convicted during thi.s term, on the evidence of his first or legal wife, sen tenced under this act to three years' imprisonment with hard labor, and fined $500. But the severest portion of the sentence was the homily. \" Thomas Hawkins,\" commenced the chief justice, \" I am sorry for you \u2014 very sorry.

Lowe.28 For ten years William H. Hooper had been dele gate to congress, and was in need of rest. He had done his duty faithfully; more acceptably, perhaps, to members of congress than any of his predecessors, and it was no easy task to fill his place. George Q. Cannon was the man selected, although an apostle and a practical polygamist. The election of Cannon was contested by George R. Maxwell, registrar of the land-office,29 who in 1870 had received a few hun dred votes, as against 26,000 in favor of Hooper; but in that year and again in 1874 had no well-grounded hope of success, save his reliance on popular preju dice. At the first session of the forty-third congress he prevailed on one of the members from New York to introduce a resolution embodying a number of charges against the apostle.

At the opening of the 44th congress Cannon's seat was also disputed by a man named Baskin. William H. Hooper was born at the old homestead known as Warwick Manor, Eastern Shore, Md, in 1813, his father, who died during William's infancy, being of English descent, and his mother of Scotch extraction. When 14 years of age he obtained a position in a store; and from this begmning rose step by step, until in 1836 we find him a member of a leading commercial firm at Galena, 111. During the crash of 1838 the firm suspended, their debts, amounting to $200,000, being afterward paid in full. In 1850 he moved to Salt Lake City under engagement to Messrs Holliday & Warner, commencing business on his own account some four years later. In 1856 he was tempo rarily appointed secretary of the territory after the death of Almon W. Bab bitt, and in 1859, as we have seen, was chosen delegate for Utah at the 30th congress, serving in the same capacity during the 39th, 40th, and 41st con gresses.

All this he had accomplished, beginning wellnigh without a dollar,44 and in a region forsaken by mankind for its worthlessness, struggling at times almost hopelessly against the unkindliness of nature and the unkindli ness of man. Esteemed by his followers as an angel of light, and considered by his foes as a minister of evil, an impostor, a hypocrite, a murderer, he was in fact simply an enthusiast, a bigoted and egotistical enthu siast, as the world believes, but a practical and far sighted man, one who by his will, ability, and intui tive knowledge of human nature was fitted to combat the difficulties that beset each step in his path of life, and to give cohesion to the heterogeneous elements of which his people was composed. \"As I sat near his bed,\" remarked George Q.

Of all the business men in Utah he was perhaps the most capable, but in the art of making money he had no set system; merely the ability for turning money to account and for taking care of it. He purchased saw-mills and thrashing machines, for instance, and let them out on shares ; he supplied settlers and emigrants with grain and provisions; from the lumber and firewood which he sold to the troops at Camp Floyd he is supposed to have netted some $200,000, and from other contracts a much larger sum. By many he is accused of en riching himself from the appropriations of tithes, and by plundering alike both saint and gentile, whereas none paid his church dues more punctually or sub scribed to charities more liberally than did the presi dent. That with all his opportunities for making money honestly and with safety he should put in peril his opportunities and his high position by stoop ing to such fraud as was commonly practised among United States officials of exalted rank, is a charge that needs no comment.47 He had a great advantage in being able to command men and dictate measures, but he did not rob the brethren, as many have as serted. At his decease the value of his estate was estimated at $2, 500,000,^ though as trustee for the church he controlled a much larger amount. \"Stenhouse, for instance, relates that in 1852 he balanced his account with the church, amounting to $200,000, by directing his clerk to place this sum to his credit for services rendered, and that in 1867 he discharged his liabilities, amounting to $967,000, in a similar manner. Rocky Mountain Saints, 665. Such statements are pure fiction. 47 In the records of the internal revenue office at Washington his total income for 1870 is stated at $25,500, in 1871 at $111, 6S0, and in 1872 at $39,952. 48 It has been stated in several books and many newspaper paragraphs that Brigham had large deposits in the Bank of England, the amount being placed as high as $20,000,000. This is entirely untrue. Stenhouse, for instance, says that a New York journalist who visited him in 1871 inquired as to this report, the sum being then stated at $17,000,000. Brigham replied that he had not a dollar outside of Utah, but that the church had some small amount abroad for its use. The following extract from Richards' Narr., MS., may serve to explain the matter: 'The rumor that President Young ever had any money in the Bank of England is entirely false.

On the failure of the bank I was fortunate enough to get my money. There was a time in our business when there was $20,000, or $30,000 to our credit. This money came from the profits on publications, and from the deposits of people who wished to emigrate. Donations were also remitted to us from Utah, and the company's fund was sustained by the emigration business.' Franklin D.

See p. 415, this vol. *' In 1869, at which date the Boston board of trade visited S. L. City, Brigham said that he had 16 living and 4 deceased wives, and 49 surviving children. This was the first time that Mormon or gentile knew how many his family mustered. Utah Notes, MS. , 1-2.

Wife No. 19, or the Story of a Life in Bondage, being a Complete Ex pose\" of Mormonism, by Ann Eliza Young, is, though the writer affects to be impartial, rather a discharge of venom by a woman scorned. She was of mature age when married, and if she had not then sense enough to under stand the responsibilities she was assuming, one would think that, some years later, she ought at least to have had discretion enough to abstain from in flicting her book and lectures on the public. The most valuable part of the work, if it can be said to have any value, is the chapter on the case of Young vs Young, in which Judge McKean awarded to the plaintiff $500 a month as alimony, and committed defendant to jail for refusing to pay it. His decision was reversed by Judge Lowe. 60 For copy of will, see .9. L. C. Tribune, Aug. 19, 1883. It has been al leged that Brigham claimed to be a prophet. This he distinctly denied. In Utah Notes, MS., it is stated that the lame, halt, and blind flocked to him to be healed, and that he used great tact in dealing with them. One man who had lost a leg came to him to be made whole. Brigham said it should be as he wished; but those created with two legs would have two legs in heaven; hence, if he caused a new one to be framed, the man would have three for all eternity.

Many years before the death of Brigham Young it was predicted that whenever that event should hap pen dissensions would occur among the Mormons, if not entire disintegration of the sect; for die when he would, or succeed him who might, such absolute power as he possessed would never be tolerated in another. He was elected at a time when his people were in distress, and accepting him as their deliverer, they had almost sunk their individuality, vesting him with all the powers of pope and potentate. But now, it was said, all was changed. Contact with the gen tile world, the establishment of gentile schools and churches, together with other influences that had long been at work, were telling gradually upon their faith. Already they had grown weary of the yoke, and once Brigham was laid in the tomb, his followers would no longer exist as a people. Never was anticipation so ill-founded. The world was now to learn that the inherent vitality of Mormonism depended not on the existence of any one man or body of men, not even on the existence of the twelve. \"If every apostle was slain but one,\" remarked George Q. Cannon at (977)"], [732, "678 CHURCH AND STATE. the October conference of 1877, \"that one had the right and authority to organize the church, and ordain other apostles and a first presidency to build up the kingdom of God.\" On the decease of the president of the church, there was for the second time in its history no quorum of the first presidency, to which authority, and to no other, as the prophet Joseph had declared, the twelve were subject. Once more, therefore, until the presi dency was reorganized, the apostles must step forward and take its duties upon themselves.1 At a meeting of the quorum, held two days after the obsequies of Brigham, ten of the number being present,2 it was unanimously resolved that John Taylor, the senior apostle and acting president of the apostles, should be sustained in his office, and that the quorum should be the presiding authority of the church.3 But this res olution, as well as the election of all the authorities of the church, from the twelve down to the deacons and teachers, must be indorsed by a vote of each quorum of the priesthood and of the people assembled in con ference. The forty-eighth semi-annual conference of the church was held, as was now the custom, in the great tabernacle;4 and in addition to the general congre gation, there were present more than five thousand of the priesthood.

He was among the foremost to aid and welcome the saints after their expulsion from Nauvoo, and indignation at their maletreatment, rather than sympathy with their sect, caused him to join the church a few weeks before the commencement of the exodus. Arriving in the valley of Great Salt Lake in September 1S48, he was appointed super intendent of public works, and was chosen a member of the legislative coun cil of the provisional state of Deseret. In 1857 he was elected second councillor to Brigham Young. In 1864-5 he was in charge of the European missions, and was afterward mayor of Salt Lake City for several terms.

Nearly two years after the assassination of his father in Carthage jail the boy set forth from Nauvoo in company with Heber C. KimbalTs family. Reaching the encampment on the Little Papillon, he be came acquainted with Col Thos L. Kane, whom he nursed through a danger ous sickness, probably saving his life. Li April 1S4S he started for Great Salt Lake in company with his brothers and sisters, and though only 15 years of age, performed a man's work, or rather the work of several men, driving a team composed of wild steers, cows, and oxen, with two wagons tied together, standing guard sometimes day and night, bringing in wood and water, herd ing cows, or assisting other teams as occasion needed. In the spring of 1S50 he was enrolled in the battalion of life-guards, and for several years thereafter was frequently called on at dead of night to set forth in pursuit of marauding Indians. In 1852 occurred the decease of his step-mother, whereby he was left alone to provide for a family of eight persons, three of them being aged and infirm. In 1855 he was ordained patriarch, this being the only office in the church which is handed down from father to son in direct lineage. Ten years later he was sent on a mission to Scandinavia, and arriving in Liver pool with a single guinea in his pocket, about sufficient to procure him a meal aud pay his railroad fare to London, borrowed the money for the remainder of his passage. After two years of missionary labor he returned to Salt Lake City, taking charge of a company of 300 emigrants on board the ship Monarch of the Sea. During his journey across the plaius he had under his care a large party of Scandinavian emigrants, and was frequently urged by the officers at government posts which he passed en route to remain with them for a season, as the Indians were at that time extremely troublesome. His answer was: 'I am used to Indian warfare, and have only provisions enough to take us home if we keep moving. We had better run the risk of fighting Indians than starve on the plains.'

Ample time was allowed for objection to be made to any of the names proposed or to any of the propositions offered; but throughout this vast gathering there was not a dissenting vote. As the quorums rose to their feet, and with uplifted hand vowed to sustain those whom their leaders had chosen, the choice was in every instance confirmed by assembled Israel. It was evident that, as yet, the church was in no danger of dissolution.7 Addressing the congregation, President Taylor re marked that the apostles were thankful for the confi dence and faith that had been manifested. For sev eral reasons he had said little since the death of the president, who for thirty-three years had stood prom inently before the church. In common with the rest of the community, he felt sad at heart. Moreover, a multiplicity of cares now devolved upon the twelve, and, so far as his position was concerned, he did not wish to say anything that might influence their choice, but desired to leave the minds of all perfectly unbiased. \"If,\" he said, \"we could carry out in our lives what we have made manifest this day by our votes, the kingdom of God would roll forth, and the favor and blessing of God would rest upon us.\" \"No man need think this work would stop. It would go on and increase until the purposes of Jehovah were accomplished, and no power on earth or in hell could stay its progress.\" Three years afterward8 John Tay lor was elected president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with George Q.

All the registration and election offices throughout the territory were declared vacant, and all duties re lating to the registration of voters, the conduct of elections, the receiving, rejection, canvassing, and re turn of votes, and the issuing of certificates, were to be performed by persons selected by a board of five commissioners, of whom three might belong to the same political party.16 After scrutiny by the board of the returns of all votes for members of the legislative assembly, certificates were to be issued to those who had been legally elected, and on or after the first meet ing of an assembly, the members of which had been so elected, that body might make such laws as it saw fit concerning the offices declared vacant, provided they were not inconsistent with the organic act and with the laws of the United States.17 The Edmunds act, intended to be supplementary to the act of 1862 and to the Poland bill, is virtually a penal statute, as indicated by its title, \"A bill to amend section 5352 of the revised statutes of the United States, in reference to bigamy, and for other purposes.\" It is also an ex post facto law, a bill of pains and penalties, wherein the judicial function, after being misinterpreted, is usurped by the legisla ture and the executive \u2014 one that might not have 16 The secretary of the territory was to be the secretary of the board, keep a journal of its proceedings, and attest its action. 17 For copy of the Edmunds act, see United States Statutes, 47th Cong. 1st Sess., 30-2; Utah Commission, 1-5; S.

But not only were the Mormons to be judged as criminals by an ex post facto law \u2014 one that barred the statute of limitations, and if strictly enforced would bring within its pale no inconsiderable portion of the adult male population of the United States \u2014 they were also to be stripped of the franchise, and made ineligible for office. It was argued in the sen ate that this was no penalty, and it may be admitted that, as a rule, to deprive men of the suffrage, and disqualify them for office, is not a severe punishment; but in Utah, where at least five hundred lucrative positions would have been laid open to a hungry horde of gentile office-seekers, the suffrage was worth more than houses and lands, for by the ballot alone could be held in check the greed of demagogues, who sought the control of the territory as a field for plunder and oppression. The bill virtually proposed to disfran chise a people, and to govern them by a committee of five men, or at least to create a government by a minority over a large majority; for it was not to b\u00ab expected that these five men, of whom a quorum be longed to the same political faction, would decide im partially on the electoral qualifications of the people. It was so expressed, and its measures were indorsed by the congress and president of the United States, the question being not whether congress had power to repeal any or all of the laws in each of the terri tories, and intrust the legislative, executive, and ju dicial functions to whomsoever it pleased \u2014 this was"], [740, "686 CHURCH AND STATE. not disputed \u2014 but whether it was at liberty to vio late for any purpose the rights guaranteed in the constitution. If there be anything sacred in the American con stitution, or in the annals of American jurisprudence, it is that in criminal prosecutions the accused should be tried by an impartial, and not by a packed, jury \u2014 by men opposed to him through interest or prejudice, and on whom a religious test is imposed as a qualifi cation. Under the Poland bill it was ordered that grand and petit juries should, if possible, be composed in equal proportions of Mormons and gentiles, or non- Mormons. The latter included, in 1874, about twenty two per cent of the entire population, and as this measure gave to them the same representation in juries as was allowed to the remaining seventy-eight per cent, its injustice is sufficiently apparent. But under the Edmunds act juries might be composed entirely of gentiles, thus giving to twenty-two, or at that date perhaps twenty-five, per Cent of the popula tion the control of the entire criminal proceedings in Utah, although more than seven eighths of the arrests made in the territory were among gentile citizens.18 Before striving to regenerate the Mormons, it would seem that congress should have attempted the regen eration of the gentile portion of the population of Utah. At the time when the Edmunds bill was passed, all the keepers of brothels, and nearly all the gamesters and saloon-keepers, were gentiles. Two hundred out of the two hundred and fifty towns and villages in the territory contained not a single bagnio.19 Until gentiles settled in Salt Lake City there were seldom heard in its streets or dwellings oaths, imprecations, or expletives; there were no place hunters or beggar-politicians; there was no harlotry; 18 For criminal statistics, taken mainly from the census of 18S0, see p. 394, tins vol. 18 Utah and its People, 21.

The Mormons were a people singularly free from vice \u2014 unless that can be called a vice which forms part of the tenets of their church \u2014 and they were one of the most industrious, sober, and thrifty communities in the world. Partly with a view to avoid the operation of the Edmunds act, the Mormons once more asked that Utah be admitted as a state. Seventy-two delegates from the different counties met at Salt Lake City, and during a nine days' session drew up a constitution,20 which was duly presented by Delegate John T. Caine, but with the usual result; and now the Mormons were left to the tender mercies of the commission. The members21 went to work vigorously; between 1882 and 1884 some twelve thousand persons were dis franchised,22 and at the latter date all the municipal and other officers in the territory living in polygamy or unlawful cohabitation were superseded, each elector being also required to swear that he was not so living. It would be a curious subject for speculation to esti mate how many voters would be disqualified if the law against illicit cohabitation were enforced in other portions of the United States.

Though, as he admits, he went to Utah with strong prejudices, he comes to this conclusion: 'Mormonism, apart from polygamy, which seems to me a temporary excrescence, will, in my opinion, grow, and probably be the religion of the settlers or farming classes in the mountainous country between the great plains east of the Rocky Mountains and California on the west.'"], [742, "CHURCH AND STATE. 688 City on the 28th of February, 1880, and in 1884 was again appointed. His message for 1882 was in the mood of former governors of Utah. \"In no sense, even in the slightest degree,\" he_ remarked, \"is the sovereignty of church over state in unison with the language or spirit of the constitution, or your country's laws. That political power is wielded by church authority throughout Utah is a fact; that officers of the church exercise authority in temporal affairs is a fact; that the sovereignty of the church is supreme, and its practices followed, the laws and courts of the United States to the contrary, is a fact. These being true in whole or in part, I submit: Do you believe that the government of the United States, with all its humanity, will much longer forbear to assert its authority in support of its absolute and undoubted sovereignty? Abiding peace, so much needed, and abundant prosperity, with its attendant blessings, can never belong to the good people of Utah until the symbol of the United States is universally regarded as the symbol of absolute sovereignty.\" Touching the matter of tithing, he said: \"The poor man who earns a dollar by the sweat of his brow is entitled to that dollar. It is the reward of honest toil, and he should be protected in the full enjoyment of it. Any exaction or undue influence to dispossess him of any part of it, in any other manner than in payment of a legal obligation, is oppression.\"23 One would think that after two years' residence in Utah the governor ought to have learned at least that, among the saints, the payment of tithes is an optional matter.

S. constitution, he quotes Judge Strong in the case of Hubcr vs Reify, in Smith's Pennsylvania Repts, iii. 117. 'There are, it is true, many things which they [judges of election] may determine, such as age and residence of a person offering to vote, whether ho has paid taxes.' 'But whether he has been guilty of a criminal offence, and as a consequence forfeited his right, is au inquiry of a different character. Neither our consti tution nor our law has conferred upon the judges of elections any such judi cial functions.' Thus with other features of the bill.

In all the stages of her existence, Utah has been constantly expanding, her growth, far from depleting her resources, only adding to her strength. Origi nally one of the most barren spots on the face of na ture, with nothing to attract even attention, the land has become as fruitful a field, and her people as busy a commonwealth, as can be found, with few exceptions, elsewhere on the Pacific slope.

As year followed year, the magic wand of progress touched into life these barren and sand-girt solitudes, and in their place sprang up a coun try teeming with the wealth of gardens and granaries, of mines and mills, of farms and factories. To show how this has been accomplished, and more especially to explain the industrial and social condition of the people during the first years of the present decade, will be my task in the concluding chapters of this volume. At the close of 1883 the population of Utah was estimated at 178,121, of whom 92,081 were males, 86,040 females, 123,506 of native and 54,615 of foreign birth.2 In 1880 there were 14,550 persons employed in agriculture, 4,149 in trade, and 10,212 miners, mechanics, and factory operatives; though notwithstanding the industrial activity of the settlers, the percentage of bread-winners was smaller than in any state or territory of the union with the exception of West Virginia, this fact being due mainly to the large proportion of women and young children. A noteworthy feature in the community was the small amount of debt, crime, and pauperism, the entire public debt, city, county, and territorial, being in 1879 only $116,251, and the number of criminals and pau pers being, as elsewhere noticed, much below the aver age throughout the United States.3 The death-rate for a series of years averaged about sixteen per thou sand, though for 1880 it was somewhat higher on account of the prevalence of diphtheria.4 2 Utah Gazetteer, 1884, p. 300, where the population is given by counties.

The number of prison ers at the Utah penitentiary for each year, with various statistics, will be found in the reports of the warden and directors in Utah Jour. Legist, passim.

It was not until 1880 that a territorial insane asylum was established, though one was projected in 1869. See Utah Laws, 1SS0, 57-G5; Utah Jour.

There were also 1,131 in California, 451 in Wyoming, 554 in Mon tana, 394 in Iowa, 208 in Nebraska, and 200 in New York. These are probably below the actual figures at that date, and certainly much below the figures for 1885.

The first Mormon who visited the Snake River country with a view to settle ment was John R. Poole of Ogden, who went there in Feb. 1879, and on his return reported favorably to Franklin D. Richards. The first family to set tle there was that of Jos. C. Fisher, who in March 1879 located at Cedar Buttes Island, being joined soon afterward by Poole and others. Ricks, Ban nack Stake, MS., passim.

The first attempt to settle the country bordering on the Little Colorado in Arizona was made in 1873, but the party returned, discouraged by the for bidding aspect of the place. Some three years later missionaries were ordered to make permanent settlements in this region, and at a meeting held at Salt Lake City in January 1876, companies were organized and captains appointed for this purpose. The first teams arrived at the Sunset crossing of the Little Colorado on the 23d of March, and after the brethren had explored the neighborhood, W. C. Allen and his company resolved to form a settlement about 20 miles to the south-east of the crossing, to be named after the captain; Geo. Lake and his band settled on the opposite side of the river, two miles to the south-west of Allen, on a spot which they called Obed, near which were springs and meadow-land; Lot Smith and his company formed a colony three miles north-east of the crossing, at a place which was called Sunset, and Jesse O. Ballinger, with his party, settled about four miles north of the crossing on the west side of the river, the settlement being named Ballinger. The brethren proceeded to plough, construct dams, and put in crops, but en countered many difficulties, the riyer-bottom being treacherous and full of quicksands. At Obed chills aud fever prevailed, the settlers being iorced to abandon the place and join the other colonies.

During this season sufficient grain had been raised to last with economy until the following harvest, and meanwhile other settlements had been started, one 25 miles up the river from Allen, to which was given the name of Wood- ruff, and one 50 miles south of Woodruff, which was called Forest Dale, the name Ballinger being now changed to Brigham City, and Allen to St Joseph. In this year, also, the colonies of eastern Arizona were divided into two presi- dencies, those on the Little Colorado being west of the dividing line. Accord- ing to a stake report, dated Aug. 31, 1878, there were at Sunset 114 souls, at Brigham City 230, at St Joseph and Woodruff each 07, and including other small settlements, a total of 587. The harvest of 1878 was severely damaged by floods, but that of 1879 was a bountiful one. In 1880 the crops again suf- fered from excessive rains and freshets. Settlements on the Little Colorado. MS. The St Joseph stake at Pima, Ar., was organized in Feb. 18S3, the place being first settled in 1S79 by families from eastern Arizona. St David was founded in 1878, Philemon C. Merrill being the first settler; Curtis in 18S1 by the Curtis family; Graham, so named from the peak a few miles to the south, in 1881; Thatcher, named after Apostle Moses Thatcher, in 1882, by John M. Moody; Central, in the same year, by Joseph Cluff and others; McDonald, named in honor of A. F. McDonald, president of the Maricopa stake, by Henry J. Home and others; Lay ton, named after President C. Layton, by John and Adam Welker, Ben. Peel, and a few others. All these settlements are in Arizona. The Mesa settlement, belonging to the Maricopa stake, was founded by companies from Bear Lake co., Id., and S. L. co., Utah. Leaving S. L. City immediately after the death of Brigham Young, they reached Salt River in Jan. 1878, and soon afterward began the construc- tion of a canal to the present site of the town. After a year's labor, only a small stream of water was obtained, barely sufficient for planting gardens, as the ditch was cut through a very difficult formation. The settlers persevered, however, their labors diminishing as their numbers increased, and in 1885 a canal had been built carrying 5,000 inches of water, at a cost of $43,000. Lehi, formerly Jonesville, also near Salt River, was founded in 1877 by a party of 71 settlers. In the autumn of this year a few members of the company became dissatisfied with the location, and set forth for San Pedro River, where they founded the settlement of St David, so named by Prest A. F. McDonald after David Patten, whom the Mormons regard as a martyr. Maricopa Stake, MS. In the Gila Valley the settlers bought squatter claims of Mexicans, and in 1SS5 had constructed over 60 miles of canals from 8 to 10 feet wide, besides a number of smaller ditches. The soil is a fertile, sandy loam, producing two crops or more a year, excellent for grapes and fruit, and of fair quality for all farm products. Sorghum produces three cuttings from one planting, and lucern is cut five or six times a year. Not more than five per cent of the land is arable, the remainder being grazing-land.

In 1883 the capital contained a fixed population of about 25,000, its corporate limits including about fifty square miles,7 divided into five municipal and twenty-one ecclesiastical wards. The city was well supplied with all modern comforts and conveniences, including gas and electric lights,8 street railroads,9 hotels,10 markets, libraries, theatres,11 clubs, and saloons, where men might drink, smoke, and dis cuss politics and religion. Through all the streets, which were about double the usual width, ran the limpid waters of City Creek, the Jordan, Red Butte, ' Ten from east to west, and five from north to south, allowing for two square miles occupied by the Fort Douglas reservation. By act of Jan. 18, 1867, the western boundary was removed from the banks of the Jordan to a line running due north and south about two miles west of the river. By act of 1872 the south line was removed to Tenth South street. 8 In 1877 George Erb organized the Rocky Mountain Electric Light Co. at Salt Lake City, afterward extending his operations to Ogden, Albuquerque, Cheyenne, Silver City, and Tucson, where, in 1884, all the works were in suc cessful operation.

The flowers were full of beauty and fra grance, surpassing, if possible, in this respect, the ancient towns of Mexico, or the modern capital in the days of Cortes. Aside from the temple and the tabernacle, Salt Lake City thus far had little to boast of in the way of architecture, nor was that little interesting. The temple, when finished, was to cost several millions,13 and the walls of gray granite, more than six feet in thickness, with a length of 200 and a width of 100 feet, were to reach a height of 100 feet.1* It was determined that this building should be of elegant design, magnificent proportions, and unique pattern, a marvel of beauty, strength, and solidity.15 As a structure in which a vast assemblage can see and hear, the new tabernacle, west of the temple, com pleted in 187C, is a remarkable edifice.

As was the case in the old taber nacle,17 the acoustic properties are remarkably good, and it is said that one standing in the east end of the gallery and uttering a few words in his lowest tone can be distinctly heard in the amphitheatre where the church dignitaries are seated, at the opposite end of the building.18 On the site of the old tabernacle now stands the new assembly hall,19 which is also the stake house for the Salt Lake stake of Zion. It is built of rough-hewn granite, the rock being taken from the same quarry that supplies material for the temple, and with frescoed ceiling, representing important events in church history. Though church-like in appearance, it is considered one of the most sightly structures in the city.23 Of the endowment house and other buildings on temple block mention has been made elsewhere.

They have assisted each other until nine out of ten own their farms, while commerce and manufac turing are to a large extent cooperative. The rights of property are respected; but while a Mormon may sell his farm to a gentile, it would not be deemed good fellowship for him to do so. Salt Lake county contained, in 1883, nearly one fifth of the population of Utah, the eastern side of the valley, where the streams of the Wasatch Moun tains are utilized for irrigation, being the principal farming section; while the western portion, in the neighborhood of the Oquirrh Range, was but sparsely settled. In this county were found, with the excep tion perhaps of coal, nearly all the minerals that con tribute to the wealth of communities. Alta, the mining town of Little Cottonwood, contained a con siderable population until the spring of 1878, when it was almost destroyed by fire.

Mr Smith is now one of the principal farmers in Davis co. Among other prominent men in that county may be mentioned the following: Joseph Barton, a native of St Helens, Lancashire, England, settled at Kaysville, his present home, in 1862, being then only 14 years of age. In 1869 he was elected county surveyor, and since that date has held the appointments of city recorder of Kaysville, county clerk, and prosecuting attorney, the last two of which offices he filled in 1885. In 1884 he was a member of the territorial legislature, and almost throughout his career in Utah has occupied positions of trust, though they liave come to him un- sought, and somewhat against his will. N. T. Porter, a native of Vermont, was one of the first settlers in Centreville, where he took up his abode in 1849^ after suffering all the hardships of the expulsion, and of a long residence at Winter Quarters. Jos. Egbert, a native of Salina CO., Ind., was a pioneer, sharing the blanket of Orson Pratt during the journey, and driving the first team that entered the valley. John R. Baines of Kaysville, a native of Bed- fordshire, England, arrived in Utah with a capital of 10 cents, and afterward accumulated a fortune of \u00a7100,000 by farming and traffic.

Pratt, Heber C. Kimball, and George D. Watt were appointed a committee to pre- pare a small school-book in characters founded on some new system of orthography, whereby the spelling and pronunciation of the English language might be made uniform and easily acquired. A further object was ex- clusiveness, a separate people wishing to have a sepa- rate language, and perhaps in time an independent lit- erature. After some previous discussion, it was agreed that each regent should prepare an alphabet of his own contrivance and present it to the board. Parley Pratt was in favor of adopting one in which each let- ter should represent a single sound, but as some of the letters represent no sound except when in combi- nation with other letters, and others are of uncertain sound, depending on such combination, the task would seem a difficult one. Finally, at a session held in De- cember of this year, characters were adopted, under the style of the Deseret alphabet, the number of let- ters, or rather sounds, being thirty-two, of which the so-called vocal sounds were eleven, including six long, with short sounds to correspond, four double and one aspirate, and twenty-one articulate sounds. Thus the long sound of the letter e in meter was represented by a character resembling the Greek sigma reversed, the double sound of woo in wood by one resembling omega, the aspirate by phi, and the articulate sound of/ by rho.

Type was ordered, and with a view to duraLJity, made so as to contain neither the top nor tail ex tensions of the letters. At a meeting of the board of regents, held in March 1854, some of it was presented to the members; and between that date and 1869 were published in the Deseret alphabet a primer, the book of Mormon, and the first book of Nephi. Some attempt was made to introduce into the public schools books thus printed, but without success. The tailless char acters, and the monotonous evenness of the lines, made the words difficult to distinguish, and it was found im possible to insure uniform pronunciation and orthog raphy. Within a few years the alphabet fell into disuse, and is now remembered only as a curiosity.88 In connection with the university may also be men tioned its library, containing at the close of 1875 about 10,000 volumes, later reserved for the use of students, but for many years open to the public.89 The terri torial library, for which, as we have seen, an appro priation was made by congress in 1850, further grants being made by the Utah legislature from time to a Richards' Utah Misc., MS., 13-16; Des. Univ., MS., 16-18; Richards' Incidents in Utah Hist., MS., 63. The preparation and use of the alphabet were ordered, or at least suggested, by Brigham Young, who, in his address to the legislature of 1S53, thus gives his reasons: 'While the World is progress ing with steam-engine power and lightning speed in the accumulation of wealth, extension of science, communication, and dissemination of letters and principle, why may not the way be paved for the easier acquisition of the Eng lish language, combining, as it does, great extension and varied expression with beauty, simplicity, and power, and being unquestionably the most use ful and beautiful in the world. But while we freely admit this, we also have to acknowledge that it is perhaps as much abused in its use, and as complex in its attainment, as any other.' In the Deseret News, Aug. 19, 1868, the weeding-out of objectionable literature is stated as an additional reason. In 1855 $2,500 was voted by the legislature for the new type and for printing books in the Deseret characters. Utah Acts Legist, 110-11. In 1859-G0 the Deseret alphabet was used in keeping Brigham's ledger, and to some extent in the historian's office and in journalism. In 1877 an attempt was made to have the book of Mormon printed in Pitman's phonotype, and Orson Pratt started for England for this purpose, but returned at the death of Brigham in August of that year.

The news is fairly reliable, but the editorial and other comments must be taken at the reader's own valuation. In freedom from journalistic scandal-mongering, they certainly rank among the foremost, and if sometimes dull, they are never silly or obscene. As a rule, the Mormon journals are less rabid in politics and religion than the gentile newspapers. Of several of the former mention has already been made. In 1867 was first published and issued daily the Deseret Evening News, the weekly having been first issued in 1850. The Daily Telegraph first appeared on the 4th of July, 1864, under the parentage of T. B. H. Stenhouse,92 and in 1869 was removed to Ogden, where it expired during that year.

The progress of agriculture in Utah will best be understood from the following figures: In 1849, as we have seen, nearly 130,000 bushels of cereals were raised from about 17,000 acres of land,1 then valued at $6.50 per acre. In 1883, which was by no means a favorable year, more than 1,600,000 bushels of wheat, and some 722,000 of oats, 305,000 of barley, 193,000 of corn, together with 215,000 tons of hay, and 800,000 bushels of potatoes, were produced from about 215,000 acres,2 the value of which varied accord ing to location from $25 to $100 per acre; the yield 1 See p. 32S, this vol. Three fourths of the crop was wheat, and there were 10,000 bushels each of corn and oats. Most of it was produced on the banks of Jordan River and its affluents, and in the neighborhood of Utah Lake. In Utah Sketches, MS., passim, it is stated that land was cultivated in San pete co. in 1848, and in Tooele and Utah cos. in 1849. Some 45,000 bushels of potatoes were also raised in 1S49, besides other vegetables, together with 40 pounds of hops and 70 of tobacco. 2 For tabulated statement of cereal and farm products for each county in 1883, see Utah Gazeteer, 1884, 297-8.

The land seemed barren beyond redemption; but from less than seventeen acres of its soil were raised, in 1880, more than 1,250 bushels of grain.6 According to the census returns for 1880, there were 9,452 farms in Utah, with a total area of 655, 524 acres, of which 416,105 were in tilth, their value, including improvements, being estimated at $14,015, 178; the total value of all farm products at $3,337,410, and of farming implements and machinery at $946, 753. The agricultural products of Utah in 1883 more than sufficed for her needs,6 and as there was no very reliable market for the surplus, there was little incen tive to further exertion in this direction. It was claimed, however, that with more careful cultivation the yield could be at least doubled on the same acreage, and it is certain that there were several million acres of farming land untouched and almost unthought of, on * Utah co. produced over 30 and Cache over 29 bushels per acre. * Agricultural statistics for Utah will be found in the census reports for 1850, 1860, 1870, 18S0.

Nev ertheless, the supply was insufficient, more water being still allowed to run to waste during the spring and winter months than was utilized.10 The winter rains swell the streams, sometimes to overflowing, when considerable damage occurs to farm ing-lands along the river-bottoms. Snow falls to a depth of from two to twenty-five feet, but does not usually melt before summer is well advanced. Wind storms are often violent, and occasionally destroy growing crops.11 The altitude of Utah renders the high lands liable to night frosts during the summer months, and on the more elevated plateaus no attempt is made to plant, the surface being devoted entirely to grazing purposes. At times in winter a very low tem perature is registered. Often the valleys are colder at night than the more elevated adjacent regions, and 9 The necessity for irrigation of course reduces the size of farms, which in 1883 probably did not average more than 25 acres.

Seldom was a harvest gathered in Utah that was not more or less injured by this scourge.14 Of the nature of the soil, slight mention has already been made.15 The early settlers discoursed in glowing terms of its fertility, though passing emigrants spoke of it as a \"mean land,\" hard, dry, and fit only for the plodding, thrifty, sober Mormon. The main draw back was the alkaline matter, which was so abundant in spots as to form a white efflorescence on the surface, and wherever this efflorescence appeared, vegetation died. Otherwise its composition was favorable to fertility, being formed principally of the disintegrated feldspathic rocks of the mountain ranges, mingled with the debris and decomposed limestone of the valleys.16 At the annual fairs held by the Deseret Agricul tural and Manufacturing Society, discontinued after 1881 on account of inability to secure permanent grounds and buildings, prizes were awarded for nearly all the varieties of grain, fruits, and vegetables that \"Says Burton: 'The spring vegetation is about a fortnight later on the banks of Jordan than above them;' and he also asserts that the presence of saleratus or alkaline salts is another cause of cold.

In 1875 there were only 544 acres in grapes, the total yield being about 1,700 tons, and the average a little more than three tons per acre.20 In 1883 nearly 700,000 bushels of potatoes were raised from about 8,500 acres of land, the value of market-garden produce for this year being less than $65,000. The small volume of business in these and in orchard products is due to the fact that most of the settlers raised their own fruit and vegetables. Of experiments in the raising of cotton in southern Utah between 1855 and 1859, mention has already been made.21 Of flax fibre there were raised in 1879 a few'thousand pounds in Washington county, and of flax straw about 1,170 tons in various counties. That sericulture will eventually become a leading feature in the industries of Utah seems almost beyond a peradventure, as portions of the country are well adapted to this industry, and nowhere else in the United States can the labor of women and children be obtained so cheaply and in such abundance. In 1868 a large cocoonery was built some four miles south of Salt Lake City,22 and about thirty acres planted in mulberry-trees, but through mismanagement, and also on account of the dampness of the building, which was of adobe, the first experiments resulted in failure. After some further efforts, a company was organized, styled the Utah Silk Association, and incorporated under the laws of the territory.23 Ground was leased m Sloan, Utah, 11, says that grapes yield five tons to the acre, but this is doubtless an exaggeration.

Samples of raw silk were sent to New York, to Florence in Italy, and Florence in Massachusetts, and were found to be well reeled and of good strength and quality. Though the in dustry is as yet in its infancy, the Mormons are confident that it will soon develop into a source of wealth.24 One of the main drawbacks to the industries of Utah has been the scarcity of timber for hard and fin ishing woods. In the mountains and canons there was a fair supply of common timber for ordinary use, though in the valleys and plains there was no forest growth, sage-brush having been often used for fuel during the first years of settlement, willow brush for fencing, and adobes for building. In later times the black balsam and red pine, indigenous to the Oquirrh and other ranges, were largely used for posts and railroad ties, tbe scrub cedar and pinon pine, found in many portions of southern and western Utah, being made to serve the same purpose. Though the people were not allowed to acquire title to timber-lands, and were even nominally forbidden to use the timber except on mineral lands, and then only for domestic purposes, they ob tained all that they needed without even paying stump age, except in a few localities. In 1883 there were a hundred or more saw-mills in operation in various parts of Utah, the price of building and fencing lum ber generally ruling at from $20 to $25, and of floor ing and finishing lumber $40 to $45, per thousand feet.25 directors.

Growing in clumps, as its name implies, and on the most unkindly soil, in thirsty sand or on barren hills, it gives value to millions of acres which would otherwise be absolutely worthless. Its growth commences in early spring, and though in May or June it dries up, it is still nutritious, having then the appearance of a light-yellow straw. Within its withered stalk it puts forth a green shoot after the first autumnal rains, and its pyriform seed, resembling the oat but of smaller size, is the favorite food of cattle. In winter it gathers juice and nourishment beneath the snow, and except in the late summer months, when it is still of fair quality on the moun tains and high in the canon ravines,28 serves as pasture for stock the year round, producing large, sinewy limbs and strong, elastic muscles, and giving to the beef and mutton an excellent flavor.27 As elsewhere on the Pacific slope, before 1886 the range for cattle decreased, lands once common for grazing23 being taken up for agriculture, while sheep raising was found to be a more profitable industry.

The emigrant roads from the Sweet- water to the Humboldt were lined with enterprising traders, who secured this lame stock on their own terms; and after fattening their cattle on the rich grasses of Utah, sent thorn to California, where they were exchanged for gold-dust or for Mexican mus- tangs, which were again traded off for cattle. Thus herds multiplied rapidly in the land of the saints; moreover, the natural increase was enormous, for as yet pasture was abundant and the inhabitants con- sumed but little meat. There was no difficulty, how- ever, in disposing of the surplus. When California became overstocked, large numbers were driven to Nevada,29 afterward to Idaho and Montana, and still more recently to Wyoming and Colorado. Gradually, however,some of these markets became glutted, though there was still a considerable demand, and in later years farmers who bad before paid little attention to grading, as they found that an inferior beast sold for almost as much as a well-bred animal, made some effort toward raising better and larger stock, such as would find ready sale in eastern cities.30 Short-horn, Devon, Hereford, Jersey, or Ayrshire cattle crossed with other breeds were then to be found on most of the principal ranges. In 1883 the total number of cattle was estimated at about 160,000,31 and their value, at an average of $30 per head, at $4,800,000. At that a As early as 1856 cattle were driven to Truckee.

The lungs gain strength from the mountain air, the hoofs from the dry cli mate, and the muscles from the distance to be trav elled for grass and water.36 Until 1870 most of the sheep gathered in Utah, apart from the few herds which the early settlers brought with them, came from New Mexico. Since that date ewes of the Spanish-merino breed have been introduced from California, together with long-wool bucks from Canada, and fine- wool rams from Ohio, the Cotswold, Kentucky, and other breeds being also represented.37 Though Utah wool sold at higher rates than that produced in neighboring states, the breed still might be better. The fleece was dry and dusty, readily absorbing alkali, though after the in troduction of the merino the wool improved consid erably as to fineness of texture.

For many years sheep were exempt from taxation, and hence large amounts of capital were invested in this industry, some of the largest ranges being in Cache Valley, where they get little fodder in winter, and under favorable conditions this industry yielded a profit of 40 per cent a year.40 36 In a letter of H.

The chief items apart from textile fabrics were flour, lumber, furniture, leather and leathern products, machinery, lead and leaden pipes, and malt liquors.43 There were at least seventy -five flour and grist mills, 100 lumber mills, eighteen furniture factories, twenty boot and shoe factories, and seven founderies and machine shops.44 A great drawback to the leather interests is that nearly all the materials used for tanning have to be imported in the shape of extracts, at a cost that leaves a factory in operation at Ogden, owned by Randall, Pugsley, & Co.

Pine barks are used to a small extent, but chestnut, oak, hemlock, and sumac are not found in Utah. Nevertheless there were in 1883 about 25 tanneries in operation, pro ducing leather valued at $250,000. During this year some 200 car-loads of hides and pelts were shipped to the eastern states, sufficient to supply almost the en tire demand of Utah for leathern products. The leather used for harness and saddlery, trunks and valises, of which the manufacture amounts to not less than $150,000, is almost entirely imported. The same condition of affairs exists among the furniture and carriage and wagon factories, which import nearly all of their material, paying for it the same rates of freight as on imported vehicles and furniture, while labor is considerably higher than in the eastern states.46 Under such disadvantages, it was greatly to the credit of the settlers that they undertook to compete to any considerable extent with eastern manufac turers, and that the production of goods should increase steadily from year to year, with occasional set-backs caused by dull markets and over-production. Manufacturing is seldom a profitable industry in new countries, even from materials native to them, and under the most favorable conditions. It is doubtful whether this branch of enterprise, throughout the Pacific slope, yielded, on an average, six per cent on the entire capital invested, and it is doubtful whether even this average was obtained in Utah. The production of iron \u2014 not only of pig-iron, but of iron and steel rails \u2014 and of mill, mining, smelting, and railroad machinery, bids fair in 1886 to be foremost 4a Nevertheless James B. Glass, who opened a carriage manufactory and repository at S. L. City in 1879, reports that between that date and 18S4 his sales increased eightfold.

In 1883 the product of her founderies and machine-shops was esti mated at over $360,000, being second only to that of her flouring and grist mills. With suitable and abun dant fuel, there is probably no state west of the Mis souri with better facilities in this direction, among them being a great variety of rich and pure ores, labor and supplies at moderate rates, a climate that seldom interferes with out-door work, a central location, a net-work of railroads, a fair demand, and a freight tariff46 that almost prohibits the shipment of crude or manufactured iron from more distant sources of sup ply, whether to Utah or the surrounding states. At a very early date it was ascertained, as will be remembered, that there were immense deposits of iron in various parts of Utah. At Smithfield, in Cache county, there were beds of hematite sixty feet in thickness. On the Provo near Kamas, on the Weber in the neighborhood of Ogden, on the Wasatch near Willard and Bountiful, at Tintic, at City Creek cafico in the Cottonwoods, on many of the mountain slopes, and on much of the desert land, ores were found in almost every variety except in the form of carbonates. The largest deposits were in Iron county, and in what may be termed the southern prolongation of the Wa satch Range, about two hundred miles south of Salt Lake City. The most remarkable outcrops were in the neighborhood of Iron Springs, Iron City, and Oak City. In the Big Blowout, as it is termed, a solid mass of magnetic ore near Iron Springs, with a length of 1,000 feet and half that width, it is esti mated that there are 3,000,000 tons near the surface. Other deposits have each 1,000,000 in sight, and in this district there are probably some 50,000,000 tons above or near the surface, while the ledges are prac tically inexhaustible and of excellent quality.47 <e Varying from $20 to $40 per ton. \" Blodgett Brittan, a prominent Philadelphia iron-master, who analyzed five specimens of ore from this district, the analyses being only for iron, phos phorus, and sulphur, reports that they averaged 04 per cent of iron, 12 per"], [790, "736 AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURES. Between 1872 and 1882 about 70,000 tons of coke were brought into Utah at a cost of $1,800,000, and during the same period 500,000 tons of coal were brought from Wyoming at a cost of nearly $4,000,000. The future of the iron interests of Utah appears to depend mainly on the question whether coking coal can be produced of sufficient consistency for the smelt- ing of pig-iron. As yet it has not been produced, or not in considerable quantity; but the coal regions are of vast extent, have been but slightly explored, and it would seem almost a certainty that deposits will somewhere be found that answer the purpose. It is well known that the best coal for coking is that which has been subjected for ages to pressure under the ap- plication of heat. The coal-beds of Utah are of re- cent and not of what is termed the true coal formation, but such coal sometimes makes excellent coke. At Wales, in Sanpete Valley, in Pleasant and Castle val- leys to the east and south, on Cedar Mountain, and elsewhere, coking coal has been found which serves for the smelting of lead, but not for iron,43 though it is believed that coke will soon be produced that can bear the weight of the charges in pig-iron smelting. In January 1854 the Utah legislature offered a reward of $1,000 to any resident who would open a vein of coal not less than 18 inches thick within 40 cent of phosphorus, and of sulphur a trace. W. A.

The largest de posits are found on the eastern slope of the Wasatch, extending at intervals from the Uintah reservation through Sanpete, Pleasant, and Castle valleys, as far south as Kanab, and its vicinity. In considerable areas the formation is broken or destroyed by erosion, among others, in the neighborhood of Iron City, where veins are plentiful, though too small to be prof itably worked. On the Weber and its tributaries in Summit county, for 12 or 15 miles above Echo City, there is coal of fair quality for household and steam making purposes, which has been worked since 1867, some of the mines being opened in 1883 to a depth of 1,100 or 1,200 feet. From the Coalville mines, a few miles south of Echo, were drawn until recent years most of the supplies needed for Salt Lake City and the northern settlements. At Evanston, also in Sum mit county and on the line of the Union Pacific, there is a vein of bituminous coal from 17 to 19 feet in thick ness. In 11 out of the 24 counties of Utah coal lands had been surveyed in 1880, varying in extent from 120 to 35,696 acres, and in several others it was known that coal existed.

Thus the yield for 1869, though there were several mines in operation at that date, was but 4,500 tone, in 1876 and 1877 45,000 tons, and in 1878 60,000 tons,62 or little more than one half of the consumption, even for the last of these years.

A huge pumping-engine of the Cornish pattern had been erected at the mine, with power to drive a double line of 20-inch pumps at a depth of 2,000 feet.70 In the San Francisco district in Beaver county, fifteen miles west of Milford and about 240 south of Salt Lake City, the leading mine was the Horn Silver, the outcrop of which resembled the top of a hay-cock, 68 The Tintic mines are further described in the S.

The Frisco Mining and Smelting Company, in the same district, owned the Carbonate mine at the town of Frisco, the Cave, Bigelow, and other locations in Gran- ite Range, and a large tract of auriferous ground in Osceola county, Nevada. The vein of the Carbonate was found to be composed of one part of rich argen- tiferous galena to three or four of trachyte, and it was of course necessary to concentrate the ores. The Cave mine, which was in the neighborhood of the Horn Silver, and consisted of a series of limestone caves, containing limonite ore near the surface and argentif- erous galena at greater depth, produced a considerable amount of bullion, and in 1884 was capable of yielding 100 tons a day, but was not worked to its full capacity pending the construction of a branch railroad.73 The mine in Osceola county covered an area of 700 acres, and was believed to contain very rich deposits of gold, but lay idle for lack of water, the nearest supply be ing 17 miles distant. During the year 1885 it was expected that arrangements would be made for work ing the ground by the hydraulic process.74 The Harrisburg or Silver Reef district was in Wash- 71 The discovery of this mine is mentioned in the Silver Reef Miner, July 30, 1879. \" J.

From the Christy Mill and Mining Company's locations, 16 in number, about 50,000 tons were taken out during the four and a half years end ing with the close of 1882, the yield of bullion being over $1,275,000. At that date the Stormont Silver Mining Company and the Barbee and Walker Mill and Mining Company, both New York organizations, had produced each a round million, the former having dis bursed $145,000 in dividends. The silver-bearing part of the reef was at least 15 miles in length, and there were hundreds of locations as yet unworked, which, if consolidated and provided with mills, could probably be developed into dividend-paying properties.75 75 Silver Reef City was incorporated in 1878.

In the Lucin district, on the dividing line between Utah and Nevada, there were several good locations. Among other gold and silver mining districts in Utah maybe mentioned the Lincoln, where was discovered the first silver mine in Utah, named the Rollins, and containing a heavy de posit of argentiferous galena. The Star District, a few miles west of Milford, formerly produced considerable bullion, but the exhaustion of the surface de posits, distance from railroads, and the fall in the price of lead caused smeltin\" operations to be suspeuded, though in 1883 development was still progressing with good results. The Rocky and Beaver Lake districts, north of the Star, abounded m ores containing gold, silver, and copper, the O. K. and Old Hickory being the prominent mines iu 1882. In the Timmons or Nebo district in Juab county there were large bodies of low-grade galena ore. At the Pine Grove district, 30 or 40 miles west of Frisco, the Carrie Lucille mine had been opened at that date to a depth of 200 feet and showed strong veins of high-grade ore. Iu the Olno and Mount Baldy districts, at Marysvale, in Piute county, the leading mine was the Deer Trail, at which there were 100,000 tons of ore in sight in 1882, averaging about au ounce of gold and 15 oz. of silver to the ton. there were several other good mines and prospects, but capital was needed tor their deve opment.

The total out put for this period was $71,502,772, or an average of more than $5,500,000 a year.76 At the close of 1883 there were at least 95 districts in Utah where mining of various descriptions was in progress, all of them contributing more or less to the total yield, though the great volume of production was confined to a few. The entire annual expense of these districts may be roughly estimated at $10,000,000, while the output is far below that figure. It does not follow, of course, that this industry has proved unprofitable, for the amount of capital invested was trifling when com pared with other states on the Pacific slope, and the difference between output and outlay may be fairly considered as so much money expended on Deseret News, Sept. 11, 1867; for description of Willard mines, ft L.

That as a rule \"it requires a mine to develop a mine,\" of whatever nature, is, however, no less true of Utah than of other mineral sections. Of mining at Carson Valley and other districts in Nevada which were formerly portions of Utah, men tion is made in my History of Nevada. It is worthy of note that from the tailings of the Raymond and Ely mine, near Pioche, W. S. Godbe and his asso ciates had extracted bullion to the amount of $750, 000 up to the close of 1884, and it was believed that the value of that which remained in the pit exceeded $1,250,000. The tailings were worked by Russell's leaching process, the distinctive feature of which is the use of sulphate of copper as an extract solution. By this process, which has now been in use for several years, it is claimed that a very high percentage of metal can be extracted, and that ores of low grade can be profitably worked.77 At an earlier date Kustel's process of leaching chloridized ores with a solution of hyposulphide of soda was somewhat in favor, and it is the opinion of many practical miners that the leaching process will eventually be substituted for the usual pan amalgamation.78 At the close of 1883 there were seventeen smelting and reduction works in Utah, producing more than 2,000 tons of bullion per month, and twenty quartz mills, with at least 350 stamps, the cost of a chloridiz ing-mill being $3,000 to $4,000 per stamp, and of a gold-mill perhaps $1,000 per stamp.79 All of the 77 Godbe's Statement, MS., 8-9. Mr Godbe is of opinion that the leaching process will, when its merits are better known, be of vast benefit to the mining world. \u2022 78In 18?1 Joshua R. Nichols, who came to S. L. City with the exclusive right for Krom's patent separating and concentrating machinery, organized a company for the introduction of this process iu connection with smelting, amalgamation, and chlorination. Mr Nichols, a native of Onondagaco., N. Y., followed at Detroit, Mich., the several occupations of farm-boy, errand-boy, clerk, and store-keeper until 1865, when he engaged in the railroad-supply business until July 1869, being then appointed assistant superintendent on the Union Pacific. Removing to Utah in 1871, he became engaged in mining and railroad enterprises.

The largest in operation at this date were the Germania lead works, where most of the base bullion was refined, and the Francklyn smelting-works. The former were at South Cottonwood, seven miles from Salt Lake City, and on the line of the Utah Central and Den ver and Rio Grande railroads. Their refining capacity was forty tons a day, and they contained all the ap paratus needed for converting galena ores into Dore bars, litharge, and marketable lead.80 The refining capacity of the Francklyn works, a mile distant, was 55 tons a day, or about 250 tons of crude ore.81 The average cost of mining and hauling in Utah, including dead-work, up to 1884, was probably not less than $10 per ton; and of milling silver ore at least as much, though there were districts where it did not exceed $4 per ton.82 When purchased at the smelting works, the silver and lead in the base bullion were es timated at New York prices. Five per cent on silver and ten per cent on lead were deducted for loss in smelting; $10 to $12 per ton for the cost of smelting, $16 to $18 for refining, and about $25 per ton for freight to New York.

Between Utah and California there were three principal lines of travel \u2014 the northern, the cen- tral, and the southern. The first skirted the upper edge of Great Salt Lake, and thence after crossing an intervening stretch of desert followed the valleys of the Humboldt and Carson rivers, being, in fact, almost identical with the Fremont route of 1845. Notwithstanding its length, it was still preferred by travellers, as pasture and water were fairly plentiful, and only two small tracts of desert land were met with.1 The central, better known to the settlers of Utah by the name of Egan's and to the California- bound emigrants as the Simpson route, though the two were by no means coincident, varied but a few miles from the fortieth parallel until reaching the 1 For descriptions of this route, see Hoi-n's Overt Guide; Kelly's Excurs. to Cat, Remy's Jour, to G. ft L.

In 1854, as we have seen, a memorial was addressed to congress by the territorial legislature, urging the construction of an overland railroad. In 1860 a sec- ond memorial was presented, to the same purport,6 and though neither of them was regarded, none rejoiced more heartily over the advent of the railroad than did the settlers of Utah. They felt now strong enough to have let in on them the advancing tide of civilization without being swept away by it. Brig ham had long foreseen that the railroad would bring with it a new and manifest destiny to his people. Being himself a man of destiny, he quickly adapted himself to the altered condition of affairs, and de clared that he believed in it. As all Utah believed in Brigham, it followed that his people would do their utmost to help it to completion. They were for the most part too poor to subscribe money, but what ever of aid or material their land and labor could sup ply was cheerfully furnished.

In 18G6 Wells, Fargo, & Co. purchased Holliday's interest, believing that the railroad would not be completed for six or seven years. They lost by the transaction, among their purchases be ing $70,000 worth of new coaches which they never used, and afterward sold to Gilmer & Salisburv for one fourth of the cost. John T.

At Weber canon, through which point it entered the valley, there was much tunnelling, blasting, and mason- work to be done, including the heavy stone-work of the bridge abut- ments. The contract amounted to about $1,000,000, gave employment to 500 or 600 men, and, according to its terms,7 eighty per cent of the payments were to be made monthly as the work progressed, and the remainder when it was completed and accepted. As soon as the contract was closed, the superintendent urged that the work be commenced immediately, promising that if men and teams were collected he would have the line surveyed and made ready for them within a few days. On this understanding, workmen were concentrated at various points on the line, but weeks passed, and still the line was not sur- veyed. Many of the sub-contractors were thus com- [ jelled to wait until the cost of their operations was argely increased by the severity of the weather, and to incur debt from bankers, merchants, and farmers, who supplied them with funds, goods, grain, and ma- terial, thinking that the money due from the pro- moters of the Union Pacific would be promptly paid; but the payments were not made as specified. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the contracts were faithfully executed, and it was acknowledged by all railroad men that nowhere on the line could the grading compare in completeness and finish with the work done by the people of Utah.

In 1847, being then a coal-miner in Clackmannanshire, he was converted to Mormonism, and the following year sailed for New Or leans with his two brothers, who had also joined the faith. They reached S. L. City in 1850. Here Sharp was first employed in quarrying stone for the tabernacle and tithing-office, and was soon afterward made superintendent of the quarry. In 1854 he was ordained a bishop, and ten years later was ap pointed assistant superintendent of public works. When the contract was made with the Union Pacific by Brigham, as above mentioned, Sharp was one of the principal sub-contractors. In 1871 he became superintendent of the Utah Central, and in 1873 president, having previously been elected vice presideut of the Utah Southern. While employed as purchasing agent for the latter company in the eastern states, he became associated with the direc tors of the Uniou Pacific, by whom he was afterward elected a member of the board. Among those who were awarded contracts by the Central Pacific was Lorin Farr, who, with Benson and West as partners, graded 200 miles of the road, Aaron F. Farr being employed as superintendent. Lorin Farr also took an active part in the building of the Utah Central and Utah Northern, of which more later, and was one of the prime movers in bringing the Denver and Rio Grande into Ogden. In 1868 he built the Ogden woollen-mills in conjunction with Randall Pugsley and Neil, and for 20 years was mayor of that city^ Aaron F. Farr was for six years probate judge of Weber co., and was elected a member of the Utah legislature. In connection with the Central Pacific may be mentioned the name of James Forbes their agent at Ogden between 1869 and 1884, and in connection with the Union Pacific, A. G.

On the 17th of May, one week after the completion of the transcontinental railroad, ground was broken near the Weber River for a line between Ogden and Salt Lake City, to be named the Utah Central.10 The road was built and equipped mainly with the material and rolling stock transferred from the Union Pacific; for even at this date there was little money in Utah, mining and traffic being as yet undeveloped, and the entire floating currency of the community was probably less than $5,000,000. This, the pioneer line of Utah, is the only one which has preserved its original identity, and that it has done so is perhaps due to the fact that it forms the main connecting link between the route of transcontinental traffic and the principal distributing point for the country. In May 1871 ground was broken at Salt Lake City for the Utah Southern,11 the line being pushed for ward at intervals both north and south through some of the richest lands in Utah, until, in June 1879, its northern terminus was at Provo,12 and its southern limit at Juab, 105 miles south of the capital.13 Later that for three months after that date no director or manager dare travel on the line without a body-guard.

The bill was vetoed by the governor; but in 1880 an effort was made to build the line by private enterprise, among the subscribers being many who could ill afford such a venture. Like others of the Utah lines, it was thus commenced on a slender capi tal, but through the aid of wealthy stockholders in the Ontario mine, it was completed as far as Park City, a distance of twenty-five miles from Coalville. Soon afterward a parallel branch, named the Echo and Park City, was built by the Union Pacific, and in 1883 the control of the former, which was known as the Utah Eastern, fell into the hands of the latter.19 The Salt Lake and Western, fifty-seven miles in length, and later a branch of the Union Pacific, was built in 1874-5 from Lehi junction, a mile north of Lehi City, to the Tintic mines. It was at first in tended to push the line through to California, tapping some of the rich mining districts of Nevada; but this project was abandoned. In 1883 it was used mainly for hauling gold, silver, and iron ore.20 The Utah and Nevada, first named the Salt Lake, Sevier Valley, and Pioche Railroad, was commenced in 1872, the inten tion being to build the line through the mining and agricultural lands of the Sevier Valley as far as Pioche, in south-eastern Nevada.

The total value of imports for 1882 was estimated\" at $11,410,000, and of exports at $11,525,000, the chief items among the former being dry goods, gro ceries, clothing, lumber and other building material, agricultural implements, leather and leathern manu factures; among the latter, gold, silver, lead, copper matte, live-stock, beef, wool, hides, pelts, furs, and tallow,25 the exports of metals alone amounting to $9,000,000. The shipment of iron ore and charcoal to Utah, which at one time were important factors in the imports, has now practically ceased; but the ter ritory must always import more or less of lumber, agricultural implements, wagons, and furniture; for there are no hard or finishing woods of native growth, and lumber of good quality cut from native timber is scarce and difficult to obtain. Imports of leathern and woollen goods will doubtless decrease with the growth of manufactures, though for reasons that are explained elsewhere, the leather produced in Utah is of inferior quality. While Utah could without difficulty produce a large surplus of many agricultural products, distance from market and an exorbitant freight tariff make it almost impossible for her to compete with the Pacific and western states. Several efforts have been made in this direction, but the results were not satisfactory, and it is doubtful whether Utah has yet sent away in all more than 1,000,000 bushels of grain.

A few months later a ship was chartered for England with 78,000 bushels,26 but though a small profit was realized, it was not sufficient to en courage further operations. If to the $11,410,000 of imports there be added 25 per cent as the profits of jobbers and retailers, we have a total of about $14,250,000, which represents approximately the general business of Utah. It is worthy of note that while this large amount of busi ness is transacted, the average number of failures for the eight years ending 1883 did not exceed fourteen, with liabilities averaging about $1 1,000.97 The credit of Utah merchants is for the most part exceptionally good ; not that they are considered more upright than other merchants, but because a very large proportion of cash is now employed in their transactions; and while many import on a small scale, the bulk of the business is done by a few large firms, which trade on a sufficient capital and do not require much credit. In 1883 it was estimated that the Zion's Cooper ative Mercantile Institution, with its 800 stock holders, its cash capital of $1,000,000, its surplus of $150,000, and its branches at Ogden and Logan, im ported at least one third of all the merchandise con sumed in Utah.

At first, as we have seen, the Mormons desired to avoid all traffic with the outside world; but as emigrants passed over their roads and through their settlements, goods were exchanged with advantage to both sides. It was not until two years after the pioneers entered the valley that the first store was opened at an adobe house, in the seventeenth ward of Salt Lake City, by the firm of Livingston & Kinkead,29 whose stock was worth some $20,000. In 1850' the firm of Holli day & Warner established a branch of their business in the capital, through their agent, William H. Hooper, who opened a store in a building erected for school purposes, on the block occupied by Brigham Young, thence removing to the structure later occupied by the museum.30 Soon the unerring scent of commerce discovered the direction which business must take, and Main 28 For further details as to commerce in Utah, and the development of the cooperative system, see Hollister's Res. and Attract, of Utah, 48-52, 67-9; Tullidge's Mag., Apr. 1881, passim; Contributor, iv. 182; Fabian's Utah, M 13; ft L.

Later it was pulled down. In the Deseret News of Sept. 28, 1854, it is stated that Capt. Grant of Fort Hall was the first outsider who brought goods to the Utah market for sale, offering sugar and coffee at $1 a pint, calico at 50 to 75 cents a yard, and other articles in proportion. Livingston & Kinkead, who came with the intention of trading for five years, realizing a certain net profit, and then re turning to Egypt, which they did, sold coffee and sugar at 40 cents a pound (a little more than a pint), calico at 25 cents a yard, etc. At this date there were few eastern, or, as they were termed, states goods in the market; and if we can believe Beadle's Life in Utah, 197, the firm took in $10,000 in gold the first day their store was opened. As this amount then probably repre sented almost the entire floating capital of the Mormons, the statement must be taken for what it is worth. 30 In 1851 David Smith and E. N.

M. Homer & Co., the fourth, occupying a portion of the premises of the Deseret News.31 Among the men who had become prominent at the time of the Utah war were Gilbert & Gerrish and William Nixon, the latter being still termed the father of Utah merchants.32 Before the Utah war and for several years after ward, internal trade was conducted mainly by barter and the due-bill system. At this period the settlers had little use for money, and preferred taking in ex change for their commodities something that they could eat, or drink, or wear, and which could not be had at home. Thus scores of well-to-do farmers, with families to clothe and educate, while living in greater comfort perhaps than those of the western or Pacific states, seldom possessed a dollar in coin. Should one of them, for instance, require clothing for wife or child, he consulted the store-keeper, who agreed, per haps, to supply him for so many loads of wood. If he should have no spare wood, he searched out some neighbor who had a surplus and offered him its equiv alent in butter or poultry. Perhaps, however, this neighbor did not need butter or poultry, but required a few loads of gravel or adobes. In that case the farmer must find some one who was willing to exchange \"Homer & Co. reduced the price of sugar to three pounds for $1, where upon Livingston & Kinkead sold it at 30 cents a pound, calico at 18| cents a yard, and marked all their goods 25 per cent below former prices, giving a guarantee never to exceed these rates.

For the tuition of his children he would pay, perhaps, so many dozens of eggs per quarter; for admission to the theatre, a score of cabbages; for the services of a laborer or mechanic, a certain number of watermelons per day ; and his tithes were usually, but not always, paid in kind. In this primitive fashion, until the advent of the railroad, trade was for the most part conducted in Utah ; and notwithstanding the wisdom and economic .system of their rulers, there were times, as will be re membered, when the settlers were really needy. The country was relieved only by a train of fortunate, or as the settlers believed providential, circumstances. These were, first, the presence of the army of Utah, which after disbursing large sums among the com munity sold them its substance at nominal rates; second, the arrival of a second army under Colonel Connor, with the interchange of traffic and demand for labor thereby occasioned; third, the needs of the overland mail and telegraph lines. In part through such adventitious aid, the mer chants of Utah, putting forth their might, built up a commerce as wonderful in its growth and develop ment as that of any of the states on the Atlantic or Pacific seaboard. As early as 1864 there were several houses in Salt Lake City that purchased in New York, St Louis, or Chicago goods to the value of $250,000 or more at a time, among them being Wil liam Jennings,33 Godbe & Mitchell, the Walker Broth- 53 Isaac, the father of William Jennings, a wealthy butcher of Yardley, Worcester, England, was better known to fame as one of the claimants in the Jennings chancery suit, in which millions of pounds were at stake; but though he proved himself a lawful claimant, his efforts won for him no substantial result. In 1847 William Jennings, then some 14 years of age, took ship for New York, where, during the ensuing winter, he was employed by a pork packer at a wage of $6 a week. After some adventures, being at one time robbed of his all and glad to find work as a journeyman butcher, and on another occasion attacked with cholera, which left him with a shattered con stitution and $200 in debt, he chanced to make the acquaintance of a catholio"], [819, "BANKING. 765 ers, and Kimball & Lawrence, than whom few firms throughout the United States, outside, perhaps, of Boston, ranked higher as to commercial integrity. After the founding of Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution, mentioned elsewhere, and the develop ment of its banking system, the trade and commerce of Utah assumed a more homogeneous character.34 In 1883 there were twelve private and five national banks in operation in Utah, of which six were at the capital, three at Ogden, two at Logan, and one each at the several towns of Provo, Corinne, St George, Richfield, Silver Reef, and Park City. Their aggre gate paid-up capital was estimated at $1,000,000, their loans at $3,000,000, their deposits at $3,500,000, and the amount of their exchange business at from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000.35 priest, from whom he borrowed $50. With this capital Jennings made his first real start in life, and turning every dollar to account, soon paid off his debt and laid the basis of his fortune. In 1851 we find him at St Joseph, where he was married to Jane Walker, a Mormon emigrant girl. In the au tumn of 1852 he arrived at Salt Lake City, having first invested all his means in three wagon-loads of groceries, from which he realized a considerable profit. Joining the church, he engaged in business as a butcher, and in 1855-6 as a tanner, boot and shoe manufacturer, and saddle and harness maker. In 1856 he was sent on a mission to Carson Valley, and, returning in the summer of 1857, commenced business some three years later as a dry-goods merchant in Salt Lake City, soon becoming the leading business man iu Utah. In 1S64 his purchases in New York and St Louis amounted to $500,000, and in Salt Lake City to $350,000, his business thereafter averaging about $2,000,000 per annum. Mr Jennings assisted in organizing the Utah Central R. R., of which he became vice-president, and succeeded Brigham as president of the Utah Southern. He was also one of the founders and directors of the Deseret National Bank, and a member of the legislature under Governor Doty. 84 Until the advent of the railroad, the prices of all commodities continued extremely high. At a convention held at the Bowery, S. L. City, Oct. 4, 1864, the price of flour was fixed at $12 per 100 Ibs, of wheat, corn, and beans at $5, $4, and $10 per bushel respectively, of pork at 30 cents, and of dried apples at 75 cents per lb., all in gold.

The business of the Commercial National was purchased from J. M. Langsdorf and H. O. Harkness, the former organizing the firm of J. W. Guthrie & Co. at Corinne in 1874. J. M.

In 1865, as we have seen, the territorial and county taxes were not allowed in any case to exceed one per cent of the assessed value of property, while for school purposes they seldom exceeded one fourth of one per cent.37 In 1883 the rate was but six mills on the dollar for both territorial and school purposes,33 counties being allowed discretion as to their rate of levy, provided that it should never exceed six mills on the dollar.39 Cities were limited to five mills on the dollar for municipal expenses, and five mills for the making and repair of streets. The assessed value of all property in the territory was, in 1883, $30,834,425,\"\u00b0 and this was considerably less than 50 per cent of the real value, the total revenue from territorial and school tax being $185, 000,41 or little more than $1 per capita of the population.

The county assessors were allowed to make their own standard, the result being that the tax was but 20 to 50 per cent of the cash valuation. Thus a steer was valued in one county at $15, in another at $6 or $8, whereas the cash value of cattle was in 1883 $25 to $30 per head.

Driven from Far West, from Kirtland, from Nauvoo, they found at length, amid the farthest west, an abiding-place \u2014 one then as remote from civilization as the wilds of Senegarnbia. There, within forty years, has been established a thriving community; there has been built one of the most sightly capitals west of the Mississippi, an oasis amid the great American desert, and with hundreds of settlements depending upon it. There farms and orchards, flocks and herds, factories and warehouses, cover the formerly unpeopled solitude, abandoned but a few decades ago to the savage, the coyote, and the wolf. The men and women who compose this com munity, drawn for the most part from the lower strata of European society, have not been slow to learn the practical lessons which their church has taught them; to learn how to exercise forethought, frugality, and other qualities which lead to success in life.67 67 1 give herewith some further biographical notices.

While at Kirtland, Hyde, who was then a stanch methodist, and a class-leader in a camp meeting at that point, heard that a golden bible had been dug out of a rock in the state of New York. A few months later he was converted to Mormonism, and set forth as a missionary, being a member of the English mission of 1837, when he was accompanied by Heber C. Kimball, Willard Richards, and others. In 1S40 he went to Jerusalem, where he held service at the mount of Olives, and consecrated the holy land, being appointed to this duty by the prophet, who declared him to be of the house of Judah. Alter the prophet's assassination, he again proceeded, in company with Parley Pratt and John Taylor, to Great Britain, where he set the churches in order, having now been chosen one of the twelve. He arrived at Winter Quarters a few weeks after the departure of the pioneer band, and on their return labored to reorganize the first presidency, Brigham Young being appointed Joseph's successor, partly by his efforts. After the saints were gathered in Utah, he"], [828, "COMMERCE AND COMMUNICATION. 774 remained in that territory as presiding apostle at various settlements, main taining robust health until about his 70th year, and continuing to labor in the ministry until his decease in November 1878.

Hyde, MS., 4; Hyde's Travels and Ministry, passim;' Tullidge's Life of Brigham Young, 69-71; Millennial Star, v. 163; Deseret News, May 5, 12, 1858, March 25, 1874, Dec. 4, 11, 1878; Smucker's Hist. Mormons, 297; ft L. Herald, Nov. 30, 1878; Prescott Miner, Dec. 13, 1878. Edward Hunter, a native of Newtown, Pa, was descended on the father's side from John Hunter, who served as lieutenant of cavalry under William III. at the battle of the Boyne, his mother's lineage being traced back to one Rob ert Owen, a Welsh quaker, who, refusing to take the oath of allegiance after the restoration in 16S5, was imprisoned, and afterward emigrating to America, purchased an estate near Philadelphia. On his father's death, Edward, who was then only 22 years of age, was offered his position as justice of the peace, but refused it on account of his youth. A few years afterward he purchased a farm in Chester co. , Pa, where he was visited by three Mormon elders, who were invited to make his house their home, though he had not yet joined the faith. In 1839 he entertained as his guest the prophet Joseph, who was then returning from his errand to Washington. In the following year he was bap tized by Orson Hyde, then on his way to Jerusalem. In the summer of 1S41 he proceeded to Nauvoo and purchased a farm from the prophet, contributing the first year no less than $15,000 to the church. In 1847 he entered the valley of Great Salt Lake with the first companies that followed the pioneers, and on the death of Newel K. Whitney was appointed presiding bishop of the church. Of the early career of Franklin D. Richards mention has already been made in these pages. In March 1869 he was appointed probate judge of Weber co., and removed with his family to Ogden, his sons Franklin S. and Charles being in 1885 prosecuting attorney, and county clerk and recorder. With the advent of the railro\"d Ogden was clearly destined to become a eity second in importance only to the capital, and one that must soon contain a large gentile element, whereby the commercial and political control of north ern Utah would be imperilled. At this juncture, also, it became advisable that the Weber stake should be raised to the dignity of an apostolic see, and for the purpose no better selection could have been made than that of Frank lin D. Richards. Brought into contact with the business world during the many years when he directed the immense European migration to Utah, a man without political ambition, kindly, placable, and tolerant, his adminis tration was no less acceptable to the gentile than to the Mormon community. At the close of 18S5, though at that date in his 65th year, he still discharged his manifold duties with all the vigor of a man yet in the prime of life, and throughout his long career he has made not a single enemy. As I have al ready stated, I am under deep obligations to Mr Richards for his kindness in furnishing much valuable material for this volume that would else have been inaccessible. Lorenzo Snow, a native of Mantua, Ohio, but of New England parentage, firstjnade the acquaintance of the Latter-day Saints while visiting his sisters at Kirtland, Lorenzo having just completed his course at Oberlm college. Convinced of the truth of their doctrines, he was baptized, ordained an elder, and sent forth to preach. As a missionary, none remained longer in the field, or travelled more, his journeys between 1S3G and 1872 extending over 150,000 miles. Iu Feb. 1846 he crossed the Mississippi in coinnuny with the twelve, being himself ordained an apostle some three years later. When Box Elder co. was organized, he was made president of the stake at Brigham City, and afterward member of the council for Box Elder and Weber, both of which positions he held for many years. He was an active promoter of the coop erative movement, establishing in 1863-4 a cooperative store, and afterward a tannery, a woollen factory, and several cooperative farms, the employes having the privilege of counting the value of their labor as so much capital"], [829, "BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. 775 invested in the concern. In the Biography and Family Records of Lorenzo Snow, Written and Compiled by his Sister, Eliza R. Snow Smith (S. L. City, 1884), we have an account of his travels and missionary labors, together with a description of various incidents in the early career of the saints. The book was written, however, as the authoress states, for the purpose of being handed down in lineal descent from generation to generation, to be preserved as a family memorial. Erastus Snow, who, with Orson Pratt, was, as the reader will remember, the first of the pioneer band that entered the valley of Great Salt Lake, joined the Mormon church in 1S33, and two years afterward was ordained an elder, though at this time only 17 years of age. Bidding adieu to his parents at St Johnsbury, Vt \u2014 his birthplace \u2014 he journeyed to Kirtland, and thence- forward became prominently identified with the church, sharing in all its tribulations. In the winter of 1S48-9 he was chosen an apostle, filling, with Lorenzo Snow, F. D. Richards, and C. C. Rich, the vacancies caused by the reorganization of the first presidency, and the apostasy of Lyman Wight. Soou afterward he was sent on a mission to Scandinavia, and through the branches of the church which he established in that country it has been claimed that nearly 20,000 converts were gathered into the fold. After the close of his missionary career his labors were directed to the founding and development of various settlements in southern Utah, over which he presided as their spiritual head, being also a member of council in the territorial legislature. Like Heber C. Kimball, Charles Coulson Rich came of puritan stoek, though a native of Kentucky, where he was born in 1809. He was baptized into the church in 1832, receiving his endowments at Kirtland, where he was ordained a high-priest by Hyrum Smith. Moving to Far West in 1836, he rendered good service during the persecutions in Missouri, being afterward forced to flee for his life through the wilderness, and making his way to Nauvoo, where he was appointed a member of the high council. In the win- ter of 184G-7 he was president of the stake at Mount Pisgah, and set forth from Winter Quarters in June of the latter year in charge of a company of saints. In 1849 he was chosen an apostle, and set out on a mission to Cali- fornia, returning in Nov. 1850, and the following year taking charge of the San Bernardino culony. His first mission to Europe was in 1SG0, when he labored for two years iu England, again reaching Zion in 1SG3, when he set- tled in Bear Lake Valley, where he resided for the most part until his decease in 1883, serving for several terms as a member of the legislature. Contributor. Dec. 18S3, 114-15. Albert Carrington, a native of Royalton, Vt, and a graduate of Dartmouth college, joined the Mormon church in Wiota, Wis., in 1811, and removed to Nauvoo in 1844, a few weeks before the prophet's assassination. A member of the pioneer band, he returned with Brigham Young to gather up the main body of the saints, and journeyed with them to the valley in 1S48. After the admission of Utah as a territory, he was several times elected a member of the council until 18G8, when he was sent to England to preside over the Eu- ropean missions. For twenty years, when not on some mission, he acted as private secretary to Brigham, and his ability gained for him among anti- Mormons the sobriquet of 'The Mormon Wolsey.' In 1870 he was ordained an apostle, and for several years afterward presided over the British mission. Elias Smith, nephew to Joseph Smith, the prophet's father, was born at Royalton, Vt, near the birthplace of the former. Joining the Mormon faith in 1834, being then 30 years of age, he removed in 1836 to Kirtland, and thence to Nauvoo, where he was business manager of the Times and Seasons and Nauvoo Neighbor, silling the same position ou the staff of the Deseret Neios after his arrival in Salt Lake City. In 1851 he was appointed probate judge of Salt Lake county, which office he retained for many years; and throughout his public career it may be said that he was almost without an enemy; in such respect were his decisions held, both in law and in equity, while his private life was also beyond reproach. In connection with the judiciary of Utah may be . mentioned Alexander"], [830, "COMMERCE AND COMMUNICATION. 776 Pyper, a native of Ayrshire, Scotland, who in 1874 was appomted police court judge of Salt Lake City. His administration of justice was somewhat in contrast with that which prevailed in the third judicial district, James B. McKean being in office during the same year. At that date the questions asked by the prosecuting attorney of jurors and applicants for citizenship were of such a nature that they frequently excluded persons who were not polygamists but simply believed in the Mormon faith, among them being, 'Are you a Mormon?' 'Have you been through the Mormon Endowment House?' 'Do vou believe that polygamy is a divine revelation?' 'My educa tion and religion,' remarked Judge Pyper, 'have taught me to deal fairly and justly toward all men, under the law, irrespective of their conditions or opinions.' . . David 0. Calder, a native of Thurso, Caithness, Scotland, joined the Mormon church in 1840, and in 1851 started for Utah, accompanied by his mother and her family. A man of excellent business ability, his talents were quickly recognized. In 1857 he was appointed chief clerk to the trustee in trust of the church, and in that position organized a system of accounts and records in all the departments of the church. Between 1859 and 1870 he held office as territorial treasurer, and after a visit to his native country, where he also labored as a missionary, was chosen business manager and managing editor of the Deseret News, and a director of Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institute, which latter position he held until his decease in July 1884. Among the presidents of the Utah stake of Zion may be mentioned Harvey Harris Cluff, a native of Kirtland, whose ancestors settled at Durham, N. H., a few years after the arrival of the Mayflower, and whose father, David Cluff, served in the American army during the war of 1812. Removing from Dur ham to Ohio in 1830, David and his family joined the Mormon faith, and pro ceeding thence to Nauvoo, shared in all the hardships of the exodus, arriving in the autumn of 1850 in the valley of Great Salt Lake, where they cast in their lot at Provo. On the Oth of October, 1856, when Brigham Young an nounced before a general conference of the church the threatened disaster to the hand-cart emigrants, Harvey Cluff, then only in his twentieth year, was one of the first who volunteered to go to their aid. On this occasion he states that the provisions and clothing furnished before nightfall were more than sufficent to load 22 teams. In 1859 Mr Cluff was elected city councillor, and in 1875, after his missionary labors, principally in Europe and the Sand wich Islands, was ordained bishop, and assigned two years later to the charge of the fourth ward of Provo City.
