I have not however thought it needful to recast or enlarge the earlier chapters, as I still cling to the hopes with regard to my first and fifth volumes which I expressed in the Preface to the fifth volume. But I have added and corrected in detail, wherever I have found any fresh matter or any fresh light on old matters. And I found also, in revising what I wrote twelve years back, that I could improve a good deal in point of mere style. I have often put a good English word where I had at first allowed a stranger to creep hi. In the first volume I have seen reason to alter my narrative on one point of some local and personal interest, though not greatly affecting the general history. I have been convinced by the arguments of Mr. James Parker that the murder of Sigeferth and Morkere at Oxford has been confounded with the massacre of Saint Brice, and that some details which belong to the earlier event have been transferred to the later. In the Norman chapter in the second volume, I have once or twice worked in, in the form of new or enlarged VOL. i. b"], [12, "PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. VI local description, the results of later journeys in Normandy and Maine. And I have also made some improvements in the maps. The author of a work on this scale always does wisely in not reviewing his reviewers, and I shall certainly not spend any great time reviewing mine. I, and doubtless others, have been amused at many pieces of criticism, perhaps not the least at the amazement with which some people have seen Old-English names written in Old-English fashion. As this seems to be commonly looked on as some special device of my own, we thus become aware of the singular fact that there are people who think themselves fit to write about early English history without having looked at Kemble or Lappenberg. But, without strictly re viewing my reviewers, I have had some doubts whether I ought not to examine in detail an article headed \"Earl Godwin and Earl Harold,\" which appeared in the North British Review for April 1870, and which bears the signature of Mr. C. H. Pearson. In earlier revisions I have made a few references to Mr. Pearson's views as set forth in his other works, and I believe that there are one or two to this article itself. But in my present revision I thought it was better on the whole not to go into any long controversy \u2014 for a long con troversy it could hardly fail to be \u2014 with regard to my general views either of Godwine or of his son. When I read Mr. Pearson's arguments, I find that his notions of historical evidence, and his general way of looking at everything, are so different from mine that it is really better to leave the question"], [13, "PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. VII to the judgement of the few scholars who may think it worth while to make a minute comparison between Mr. Pearson's statements and my own. I say a minute comparison, because it would not be safe to accept either my views or the statements of the original writers on Mr. Pearson's showing. I must decline to have my judgement of Godwine measured by the report which Mr. Pearson has thought fit to give of it. I do not know where Mr. Pearson found that \" Godwin is the spotless being of Mr. Freeman's imagination, the saint and hero of an impure and unheroic age.\" He certainly did not find that picture any where in the History of the Norman Conquest, least of all where my notions of Godwine are most formally put forth, namely in the seventh chapter, the first in the second volume. I must further protest against Mr. Pearson's state ment that I \" believe in \" a \" settlement of the Witan in 1 051\" in favour of William. Of this belief no trace will be found in my writings ; indeed it is expressly denied at p. 430 of my second volume (p. 421 of the first edition). Nor do I admit that I have \" started from the conception that history for eight hundred years, has been in a conspiracy against truth.\" I simply go back from legend to history, from the slanders of later times to the wit ness of the men who eight hundred years back wrote real history. Mr. Pearson goes on to say that \" my style throughout is that of a pleader who tries to demolish the character of witnesses by detecting them in trivial inconsistencies, and who delights in accumulating the absurd stories of late and obscure chroniclers in order to throw doubts b 2"], [14, "PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. VIII on a general verdict.\" I can only infer that Mr. Pearson is not a student of comparative mythology. I can only infer that he does not see the import ance of tracing how a story grew, and what shapes it took in different hands, according to times, places, and changes of feeling. When Mr. Pearson utterly misunderstands my plainest words, when I can find no common ground with him from which to examine historical evidence, I must leave it to others to judge between him and me on the general question. At the same time, in case any one should make it his business to compare Mr. Pearson and me in detail, I must ask him to accept nothing on Mr. Pearson's showing \u2014 as I ask no one to accept any thing on my showing \u2014 without minutely testing it by the authorities. I think that any one who does so will not fail to see how much of Mr. Pearson's genealogical argument is upset by his constant con fusion between Wulfnoth the son of Godwine and \u00c6thelnoth the thegn of Kent. Even a Domesday copyist, in his wildest departures from the true forms of English names, would not write Alnod and Ulnod indiscriminately. I have gone thoroughly into this matter in Appendix N., vol. iv, where I see that I have referred to an earlier work of Mr. Pearson's. So again, when Mr. Pearson rakes up the real or supposed evil deeds (among which he seems to reckon the marriages) of several English Bishops of the eleventh century, he makes his list longer by bringing in a tale, true or false, about Walter of Hereford, who was not an Englishman. And I must lastly beg that no one will accept Mr. Pear-"], [15, "PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. IX son's summary of any part of the Encomium Emm\u00e6, without reading every word of the Encomiast's text for himself. As Mr. Pearson is an historical writer of some reputation, I have thought it right not to let his distinctly controversial article pass by altogether unnoticed. I do not know that there is any other writer of position with whom I need to enter into any controversy. If I were to examine any anonymous criticism, it would be an article signed \"H. A.\" in the North American Review, in which I am blamed for maintaining the innocence of Godwine, though his guilt is asserted in \"the Saxon Chronicle.\" It would almost seem as if \" H. A.\" had written this without either looking at the Chronicles themselves or at the examina- tion of their witness in my Appendix. Indeed it would seem that, even in such respectable quar ters as the North American Review, the idea still lingers that there is a single book called \" The Saxon Chronicle.\" I need hardly say that strange havoc would be made of the history, as strange havoc often has been made, by any one who did not stop to compare the wide difference in statement and feeling between Abingdon and Peterborough. The Index to the whole five volumes, which will include the index to the present edition of these two, is in preparation. SOMEKLBAZB, \"WELLS, April 14th, 1877."], [16, "PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. IN revising these volumes for the present edition, I have made many improvements for which I feel that I must in some sort throw myself on the indulgence of the buyers and readers of the first edition. The publication of a large work of this kind in distinct volumes is, I believe, on the whole, the most satisfactory way for the reader, as it cer tainly is for the author. But it has its disadvantages. If no part of a work is printed till the last page of the last volume is written, a final revision may give the earlier parts the advantage of the author's researches up to the last moment. But if volumes are published separately, the researches which are needful for the composition of the later volumes continually bring to light matter which would have been highly useful during the composition of the earlier volumes. This is especially the case with a subject like mine, where information has to be sought for in so many quarters, and where a great deal of information is drawn from purely incidental notices in quarters where it might hardly have been looked for. Take for instance one of our primary authorities for a great part of my subject, the Nor-"], [17, "PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. XI man Survey. None but a professed editor or com mentator on Domesday would sit down to read it through, word for word ; but, in searching in it for facts bearing on one subject, one is sure to light by the way on facts bearing on half-a-dozen other subjects as well. In these ways I have, in the course of writing the later parts of my work, come across much matter which enables me to correct and improve what I had already written in the earlier parts. All these improvements in detail I have thought it right to make in preparing a second edition. And I have also in many places improved the arrangement of the matter, by throw ing some portions of the text and a considerable portion of the notes into the form of Appendices. These portions were chiefly passages which consisted of dissertation rather than narrative, and which therefore seemed better suited to the form of de tached essays. This change will, I hope, be found to make the narrative hang better together ; but, as the passages removed to the Appendix have shown a tendency to grow on the road, it has somewhat increased the size of the volumes. I have also done my best to improve the maps. I have added a map of Gaul in the tenth century, which seemed needful for the better understanding of the fourth Chapter. I have also recast the map of Britain in 597, which, as it stood in the first edition, was a failure, owing to the attempt, which can never be thoroughly successful, to represent the state of things at two different periods at once. As it is, it is designed to show, as far as evidence or probable conjecture makes it possible to show, how"], [18, "PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. XII things stood at the exact time of the mission of Augustine. In this difficult task I have been much helped by Archdeacon Jones, my former colleague in writing the History of Saint David's, by Mr. J. R. Green, and yet more by Mr. Haddan, whose know ledge of Celtic matters is really amazing. But, after all, there are many points on which it is impossible to get beyond conjecture. As the changes in the text and notes have dis turbed the order of paging, I have added a special Index to this edition of these two volumes. When the whole work is complete, a general Index to the whole five volumes will be given. It will be at once seen that these improvements are in some sort made at the cost of the purchasers of the first edition, for it is impossible for them to be thrown into the form of a separate supplement for their benefit. I can only ask again for their indulgence towards a course which could not be helped, if the book was to be brought as near perfection as might be. The revision required by these volumes has un avoidably delayed the composition of the fourth volume ; but I am happy to say that it is begun. SOMEELEAZE, WELLS, November 26th, 1869."], [19, "PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. J. HE present volume is the first instalment of a work which I have contemplated, and for which I have at various times collected materials, for the last twenty years. I had hoped to complete the work, or so much of it as would come down to the actual accession of William the Conqueror, in time for it to appear during the year 1866, the octocentenary year of the Conquest. I found how ever that, to make the main subject really in telligible from my point of view, it was necessary to treat the preliminary history at much greater length than I had originally thought of. The pre sent volume therefore is merely introductory to the account of the actual Conquest. The second portion of the narrative, containing the reigns of Eadward, Harold, and William, is already in progress, and will follow with all possible speed. I think it right to add that this work must not be taken as a sign that I have at all given up the design of going on with my History of Federal Government. Of the second volume of that work a considerable part is already written. One or two"], [20, "PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. XIV circumstances led me to lay it aside for a time, and I do not at all regret that such has been the case. The part on which I was engaged was the history of the German Confederation, and I find that, of what I have written, part has already become antiquated through the events of the past year. When Germany shall have assumed a shape pos sessing some greater chance of permanence than her present clearly transitional state, I shall be better able to take a general view of German Federal history from the beginning. The peculiarity of the German Confederation is that it is the one recorded Confederation which arose from the separation of the component parts of a Kingdom. There now seems every chance of its changing back again into some thing more like its original state. The condition of the Hanseatic towns also, another part of my sub ject, is already greatly modified by the same events. It is even possible that they may not be without effect on the European position of Switzerland. On the whole, I believe that the delay in my work will only lead to its improvement, and that a volume on Swiss Federalism, and on German Federalism generally, will be far more valuable two or three years hence than it would have been if I had been able to complete it in the year before last. With regard to my present work, my main object is to draw out that view of the Norman Conquest which I believe to be the one true one. That view, I may say, is formed by uniting the views of the two most eminent writers who have dealt with the subject, Augustine Thierry and Sir Francis Palgrave. The name of the last-mentioned illustrious scholar"], [21, "PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. XV can never be uttered by any student of early English history without a feeling of deep gratitude. But his great and unfinished works set forth only half the truth. His eloquent French rival sets forth the other half. Each of these great writers must stand charged with considerable exaggeration on his own side of the question. Still, in the main, I think we may say that each is right in what he asserts and wrong only in what he leaves out of sight. From one point of view, the Norman Conquest was nearly all that Thierry says that it was ; from another point of view, it was hardly more than Sir Francis Palgrave says that it was. Both writers also singu larly resemble each other in a certain lack of critical power. Nothing in any period of history, above all, nothing in the period of history with which I am concerned, is more necessary than to distinguish the respective value of different authorities. Now in this respect both Thierry and Sir Francis Palgrave were deficient. Neither, I believe, ever made a statement for which he could not give chapter and verse in some shape or other. But both of them were too apt to catch at any statement which seemed at all to support their several theories, without always stopping to reflect whether such statements came from contemporary chronicles or charters or from careless and ill-informed compilers three or four centuries later. The prominence which I have given to the pre liminary history contained in this volume is due to a deep and growing conviction that the history of the Norman Conquest, and indeed all later English history also, is constantly misunderstood through"], [22, "PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. XVI a fatal habit of beginning the study of English history with the Norman Conquest itself. A confused and unhappy nomenclature hinders many people from realizing that Englishmen before 1066 were the same people as Englishmen after 1066. They thus fail to perceive that the Norman Conquest, instead of wiping out the race, the laws, or the language which existed before it, did but communicate to us a cer tain foreign infusion in all three branches, which was speedily absorbed and assimilated into the preexisting mass. We cannot understand the Norman Conquest of England without knowing something of the history both of Englishmen and of Normans before they met in arms on the hills of Sussex. As regards the Normans, the conquest of England was but the most brilliant and the most permanent of a series of brilliant conquests, from the occupation of Rouen to the occupation of Naples. As regards England, the Conquest was the grand and final result of causes which had been at work at least ever since the death of Eadgar. The Danish invasions, and the Norman tendencies of Eadward, each, in different ways, both suggested the enterprise of WTilliam and made that enterprise easier to be effected. I there fore look on the earlier history of Normandy, and still more on the English history from the accession of \u00c6thelred to the death of Harthacnut, as so closely connected with my subject as to need a treatment in considerable detail. With the reign of Eadward the period of the Conquest itself begins. And I may add that I have done my best to throw some life into a period of our history which is full alike of political instruction and of living personal interest."], [23, "PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. XVII That period is commonly presented to ordinary readers in the guise either of fantastic legends or else of summaries of the most repulsive dryness. I have striven to show what was the real political state of England in the tenth and eleventh centuries. I have striven also to clothe with flesh and blood the dry bones of men like Brihtnoth and Ulfcytel and Eadmund and our illustrious Danish conqueror himself. As in my History of Federal Government I ven tured to restore the Greek spelling of proper names, so I now follow the example of scholars like Kemble, Lappenberg, and others, in employing the genuine spelling of Old-English names. As they are gene rally spelled, they are a mere chaos of French and Latin corruptions, following no principle of any kind. \u00c6'Selstdn becomes \" while \u00c6pelred, exactly the same form, becomes \"\u00c6thelred.\" I do not however follow Mr. Kemble in retaining the obsolete letter #. It seems to me as much out of place to write \u00c6'cSel'Sry^ in the midst of a modern English sentence, as it would be to write Adene or Qeojjompos. At one time I felt inclined to ex cept those names which are still in familiar use, like Alfred and Edward, on the same principle on which I write Philip and not Philippos. Were the English names, like the Greek, simply cut short at the end, there would be no difficulty in so doing. But it would be unpleasantly inconsistent to write \u00c6lfric and Alfred, Eadwig and Edward. I there fore make a chronological distinction ; by the time of our post-Norman Edwards, the a had been dropped in contemporary spelling, and I write accordingly."], [24, "PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. XVIII The names of Normans and other foreigners, Wil liam, John, and the like, I give in their modem shape. Nothing could be gained by writing Wil lelm, Willaume, or Guillaume, all of them mere corruptions just as much as the modern English form. Names of places again I write with their usual modern spelling, because in them we have, what in the names of men we have not, an universally received and, allowing for some misconceptions, fairly consistent system. I except only one or two places, like Brunanburh, Ethandun, Assandun, of which the geographical position is more or less un certain, and whose fame is wholly confined to the time of which I am writing. I have given two maps, chiefly founded on those in Spruner's Hand-Atlas. As in the maps which accompanied my History of Federal Government, any attempts to mark the boundaries of states whose boundaries were always fluctuating must always be more or less conjectural, and my conjectures, or those of Dr. Spruner, may not be the same as the conjectures of all my readers. All such attempts must be taken at what they are wTorth and no more. For one such conjecture I am specially responsible. In the map of Britain in 597 I have attempted, by means of cross-colouring, to mark the extent of ter ritory north of the Thames and Avon which was West-Saxon in 597, but which I believe to have become Mercian in 628. In so doing I have followed the indications given by Dr. Guest in his papers and local maps ; but I believe that mine is the first at tempt to show the results of his researches on the general map of Britain. In this map my object was"], [25, "PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. XIX to mark all ascertained places mentioned in the Chronicles, with the addition of a few from B\u00e6da, up to the time of Ecgberht. In the later map of the English Empire my principle was to mark those places which were mentioned in my own history from the time of Ecgberht to the Norman Conquest. I have now only to return my thanks to those friends who have helped me in my undertaking in various ways, by comments and suggestions, by the loan of books, and in a few cases, though very few, by verifying references to books which I had not at hand. At their head I am proud to place the two men who stand at the head of living students of English history, Dr. Guest and Professor Stubbs. I have also to thank Viscount Strangford for several valuable suggestions as to the early Celtic ethnology of Britain. My thanks are due also for help of different kinds to the Rev. S. W. Wayte, now Pre sident of Trinity College, to the Rev. John Earle, late Professor of Anglo-Saxon, to the Rev. J. E. B. Mayor, of St. John's College, Cambridge, to F. H. Dickinson, Esq., of Trinity College, Cambridge, to the Rev. J. R. Green, of Jesus College, a rising scholar to whom I look for the continuation of my own work, and to W. B. Dawkins, Esq., of Jesus College and of the Geological Survey. Mr. Dawkins I have especially to thank for much help in my investiga tions of the battle-fields of Maldon and Assandun, and I look to him for more valuable help still when I come to the greater battle which forms the centre of my whole history.

INTRODUCTION. npHE Norman Conquest is the great turning-point in Import- -*- the history of the English nation. Since the first Norman settlement of the English in Britain, the introduction C\u2122'!116?4' \u00b0 not as the of Christianity is the only event which can compare beginning \u2022 ,!\u2022;\u25a0\u2022 . i \u2022 -..\u00ab. of English with it in importance. And there is this wide difference history, but between the two. The introduction of Christianity was an event which could hardly fail to happen sooner or point. later ; in accepting the Gospel, the English only followed the same law which, sooner or later, affected all the Teutonic nations. But the Norman Conquest is something which stands without a parallel in any other Teutonic land. If that Conquest be only looked on in its true light, it is impossible to exaggerate its importance. And yet there is no event whose true nature has been more commonly and more utterly mistaken. No event is less fitted to be taken, as it so often has been taken, for the beginniDg of our national history. For its whole importance is not the importance which belongs to a beginning, but the importance which belongs to a turning-point. The Norman Conquest brought with it a most extensive foreign infusion, an infusion which affected our blood, our language, our laws, our arts ; still it was only an infusion ; the older and stronger elements still survived, and in the long run they again made good their supremacy. So far from being the VOL. I. B"], [44, "INTRODUCTION. 2 chap. i. beginning of our national history, the Norman Conquest was the temporary overthrow of our national being. But it was only a temporary overthrow. To a superficial observer the English people might seem for a while to be wiped out of the roll-call of the nations, or to exist only as the bondmen of foreign rulers in their own land. But in a few generations we led captive our conquerors ; England was England once again, and the descendants of the Norman invaders were found to be among the truest of Englishmen. England may be as justly proud of rearing such step -children as Simon of Montfort and Edward the First as of being the natural Import- mother of \u00c6lfred and of Harold. In no part of history earlier can any event be truly understood without reference to English f-jjg events which went before it and which prepared history to A '\u25a0 the right the way for it. But in no case is such reference more u no g r~ standing needful than in dealing with an event like that with Conquest which we are now concerned. The whole importance of the Norman Conquest consists in the effect which it had on an existing nation, humbled indeed, but neither wiped out nor utterly enslaved, in the changes which it wrought in an existing constitution, which was by degrees greatly modified, but which was never either wholly abolished or wholly trampled under foot. William, King of the English, claimed to reign as the lawful successor of the Kings of the English who reigned before him. He claimed to inherit their rights, and he pro fessed to govern according to their laws. His position therefore, and the whole nature of the great revolution which he wrought, are utterly unintelligible without a full understanding of the state of things which he found existing. Even when one nation actually displaces another, some knowledge of the condition of the dis placed nation is necessary to understand the position of the displacing nation. The English Conquest of Britain"], [45, "CHARACTER OF THE NORMAN CONQUEST. 3 cannot be thoroughly understood without some knowledge chap. i. of the earlier history of the Celt and the Roman. But when there is no displacement of a nation, when there is not even the utter overthrow of a constitution, when there are only changes, however many and important, wrought in an existing system, a knowledge of the earlier state of things is an absolutely essential part of any knowledge of the later. The Norman Conquest of England is simply an insoluble puzzle without a clear notion of the condition of England and the English people at the time when the Conqueror and his followers first set foot upon our shores. The Norman Conquest again is an event which stands Character by itself in the history of Europe. It took place at a man con_ transitional period in the world's developement. Those 1uest as , 1 l compared elements, Roman and Teutonic, Imperial and ecclesiastical, with earlier ... , . . . , j. and later which stood, as it were, side by side in the system ot conquests. the early middle age, were then being fused together into the later system of feudal, papal, crusading Europe. The Conquest itself was one of the most important steps in the change. A kingdom which had hitherto been purely Teutonic was brought within the sphere of the laws, the manners, the speech, of the Romance nations. At the very moment when Pope and C\u00e6sar held each other in the death-grasp, a Church which had hitherto maintained a kind of insular and barbaric independence was brought into a far more intimate connexion with the Roman See. And as a conquest, compared with earlier and with later conquests, the Norman Conquest of England holds a middle position between the two classes, and shares somewhat of the nature of both. It was something less than such conquests as form the main subject of history during the great Wandering of the Nations. It was something more than those political conquests which fill up too large a space in the B 2"], [46, "INTRODUCTION. 4 chap. i. history of modern times. It was much less than a The im- national migration ; it was much more than a mere mediate , % change ef- change of frontier or of dynasty. It was not sucn a theNo^ change as when the first English conquerors slew, ex man Con- pe^ed or enslaved the whole nation of the vanquished quest less 1 _ . than the Britons.

But it was a far greater change than commonly follows on the transfer of a province from one sovereign to another, or even on the forcible acquisition of a crown by an alien dynasty. The conquest of England by William wrought less immediate change than the con quest of Africa by Genseric ; it wrought a greater immediate change than the conquest of Sicily by Charles In what of Anjou. It brought with it not only a new dynasty, really con- but a new nobility ; it did not expel or transplant the sisted. English nation or any part of it ; but it gradually deprived the leading men and families of England of their lands and offices, and thrust them down into a secondary position under alien intruders. It did not at once sweep away the old laws and liberties of the land ; but it at once changed the manner and spirit of their administration, and it opened the way for endless later changes in the laws themselves. It did not abolish the English language ; but it brought in a new language by its side, a language which for a while supplanted it as the language of polite intercourse, and which did not yield to the reviving elder speech till it had affected it by the largest infusion that the vocabulary of one Formal European tongue ever received from another. The most changes for important of the formal changes in legislation, in lan parttft gaa\u00a7e> ln tae system of government and in the tenure later date, of land, were no immediate consequences of the Conquest,"], [47, "EFFECTS OF THE CONQUEST. 5 no direct innovations of the reign of William. They chap. i. were the gradual developements of later times, of times when the Norman as well as the Englishman found himself under the yoke of a foreign master. But the reign of William paved the way for all the later changes that were to come, and the immediate changes which he himself wrought were, after all, great and weighty. Immediate They were in truth none the less great and weighty t^e Qon. because they- affected the practical condition of the 1\"est J l mamly people far more than they affected its written laws and practical. institutions. When a nation is driven to receive a foreigner as its King, when that foreign King divides the highest offices and the greatest estates of the land among his foreign followers, though such a change must be carefully distinguished from changes in the written law, still the change is, for the time, practically the greatest which a nation and its leaders can undergo. I propose then, as a necessary introduction to my Plan and narrative of the actual Conquest, to sketch the condition the present of England and of Normandy at the time when the two Hlstory nations came into contact with each other. This process will involve a summary of the earlier history of both countries.

The period of the diate actual Conquest and its immediate causes, the reigns I042-io87. of Eadward, of Harold, and of William, will form the centre of the work.

It will be Britain- . a.d. 449 enough to point out the essential difference between 924 the traditional narrative of the English Conquest, as contained in the English Chronicles,1 and the romantic narrative of which Geoffrey of Monmouth is the chief spokesman.

Such are the evidence of language and local nomenclature, the evidence of the surviving antiquities, the camps, the dykes, the barrows, which chronicle this warfare as well as the warfare of earlier and of later times. The only question is whether an accurate narrative of details 1 On this subject I must refer, once for all, to the papers of Dr. Guest in the Arch\u00e6ological Journal and in the volumes of Transactions of the Arch\u00e6ological Institute, especially to the paper on the Early English Settlements in South Britain in the Salisbury Volume. On these questions I have little to do except to profess myself, in all essential points, an unreserved follower of that illustrious scholar.

II, Questions of earlier Teutonic invasions and settle ments in Britain. can have been handed on from the date assigned to Hengest. to the ascertained date of B\u00e6da, whether by oral tradition, by runes, or by written documents which are lost to us. And this really amounts to little more than a question whether, in the earliest part of the narrative, the exact names and the exact dates can always be trusted. Some of the earlier names may be mythical ; a some of the dates may have been reached by ingenious calculation rather than by genuine tradition. But granting all this, the main substance of the narrative remains essentially where it was. Much learning and ingenuity has been spent, and, I venture to think, in many cases wasted, in attempts to show the untrustworthiness of the traditional account, by bringing forward proofs of Teutonic invasions, and even of Teutonic settlements, of an earlier date than that assigned by the Chronicles to the beginning of the English Conquest.2 The facts which are brought forward are in most cases probable and in some cases certain, but I cannot look on them as having that bearing on later history which they have sometimes been supposed to have. It is possible that, among the tribes which C\u00e6sar found in Britain, some, especially in the eastern districts of the island, may have been of Teutonic origin, or in some degree mingled with Teutonic elements. It is certain that in Britain, as 1 It is really hardly worth while to dispute about the names of Hengest and Horsa. The evidence for their historical character seems to me at least as strong as the suspicion of their mythical character. But whether the chiefs who led the first Jutish settlers in Kent bore these names or any others does not affect the reality of the Jutish settlement. I must confess however that there are names in the Chronicles which strike me as far more suspicious than those of Hengest and Horsa. I mean names like Port and Wihtgar, who figure in the entries for 501 and 544. See Earle's Parallel Chronicles, p. ix. 2 For all that is to be said on this side of the question, see the eleventh chapter of Palgrave's English Commonwealth and the first chapter of Kemble's Saxons in England.

Roman armies, and that settlements of such soldiers some times grew into permanent colonies.1 It is certain that, long before the days of Cerdic or Hengest, Theodosius and Stilicho repelled Teutonic invasions ; and it is probable that, by repelling such invasions, they hindered the for mation of Teutonic settlements in Britain at that earlier time.2 But these facts or probabilities do not affect the The course credibility of the recorded course of the English Conquest, iisa c0n-\u00b0 or of the tradition which fixes its real beginning in the q\"es' \"ot middle of the fifth century.

Teu tonic tribes subdued by the Roman arms, Teutonic soldiers 1 See Guest, Salisbury Volume, p. 35. 2 The account in Ammianus (xxxvii. 8) of the exploits of the elder Theodosius does not speak of the Saxons or of any other Teutons as invaders of Britain, but only as invaders of Gaul. But there seems quite evidence enough to show that, at the end of the fourth and beginning of the fifth centuries, Britain was constantly ravaged by Saxon pirates. This is shown by the well-known phrases of Limes Saxonicus and Littus Saxoni cum, for the true explanation of which I must again refer to Dr. Guest. The Saxon shore or march, like the Welsh march in England, like the Spanish, Slavonic, and other marches of the later Empire, was, not a district occupied by Saxons, but the march \u2014 in this case a shore \u2014 lying near to the Saxons and exposed to their ravages. Ammianus himself, in the passage just referred to, speaks of \" Nectaridus comes maritimi tractus\" as killed by the Picts at this time. The phrase is analogous to that of \"Scythici limitis dux,\" etc. in Vopiscus, Aurelian, 13. Claudian also constantly couples the Saxons with the Picts and Scots as among the invaders of Roman Britain who were repulsed by Theodosius and Stilicho ; .... \"Maduerunt Saxone fuso Orcades : incaluit Pictorum sanguine Thule : Scotorum cumulos flevit glacialis Ierne.\" Carm. vhi. 31. Cf. xviii. 392; xxii. 255. So Sidonius Apollinaris, Carm. vii. 370 (cf. Epp. viii. 6) ; \" Quin et Aremoricus piratam Saxona tractus Sperabat, cui pelle salum sulcare Britannum Ludus, et asserto glaueum mare findere lembo.\" Were our keels coracles, or was the British fashion transferred to the Saxon ?"], [54, "FORMATION OF THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND. 12 CHAP. II Light thrown on these events by the ana logy of the Danish invasions. 878 912 planted as colonists by the Roman government, would sink into the general mass of Roman subjects; they would retain no strong national feeling; they would most likely not even retain their national language. The only way in which they could possibly influence the later history would be by making the establishment of the later Teutonic settlers a less difficult matter in those parts of the country which they occupied than in those where the population was purely Celtic or Roman.1 We may admit the fact that the Teutonic, and even the distinctively Saxon, invasions began, not in the fifth century, but in the fourth. But the true bearing of this fact will be best understood by comparing the successive Saxon invasions with the later and better known invasions of the Danes both in England and in Gaul. In the Danish invasions I shall presently endeavour to establish three periods, one of mere plunder, one of settlement, one of political conquest. For the last of these three there was no opportunity under the circumstances of the earlier Teutonic invaders, but for the first two stages we may fairly look in the history of the English, as well as in that of the Danish, Conquest. The Saxon pirates against whom the Roman government found it needful to establish so elaborate a system of defence, find their parallels in those Danish plundering expeditions which ravaged various parts of England in the latter half of the eighth century and the former half of the ninth, and in the ravages inflicted on Gaul by chieftains earlier than Hasting. The Anglian, Saxon, and Jutish settlements of the fifth and sixth centuries answer to the settlements of Guthrum in East Anglia in the ninth century and of Rolf in Neustria in the tenth. Even if it be held that the Saxons who were driven back by Theodo sius and Stilicho designed settlement and not merely 1 Yet even this view seems to be pretty well disposed of by Dr. Guest in his Salisbury paper."], [55, "COURSE OF THE ENGLISH CONQUEST. 13 plunder, still, as they did not actually settle, the case chap. ii. remains much the same. The Teutons were baffled in their attempts at settlement in the fourth century; they suc ceeded in their attempts at settlement in the fifth. The general history of the Conquest, as handed down to us in the Chronicles, is therefore in no way affected by the certain fact of earlier incursions, by the possible fact of much earlier settlements. The really lasting effect of the Saxon invasions of the fourth century seems to have been this ; the Saxon name became familiar to the Celtic in habitants of Britain earlier than the Anglian name ; con sequently Saxon, and not Angle or English, has been the name by which the Teutonic immigrants in Britain have been known to their Celtic neighbours from that day to this.1 What then the English Chronicles profess to record is, Course of not these early and transient incursions which led to no conquest. permanent result, but that series of constant, systematic, successful attempts at settlement on the part of various Teutonic tribes which constituted the English Conquest of Britain. Early in the fifth century the Roman legions 418. were withdrawn from the island, and the former provincials were left to defend their new and precarious independence how they might. The Southern Britons were now exposed No impro to the attacks of the Picts and Scots who had never the story submitted to the Roman j^oke, and there is no absurdity in , r*1_ . the familiar story that a British prince took Teutonic tation, but ... . the tale not mercenaries into his pay, and that these dangerous allies essential. took advantage of the weakness of their hosts to establish themselves as permanent possessors of part of the island. 1 I use the word \" Saxon\" throughout only in its correct sense, to express one only among several Teutonic tribes which settled in Britain. The name \"Saxon\" was never used by the people themselves to express the whole nation, which was called, sometimes \"Anglo-Saxon,\" but, far more * commonly, simply \"Angle\" or \"English.\" I shall discuss this point more at length in the Appendix, Note A."], [56, "FORMATION OF THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND. 14 chap. ii. But if this account be rejected, the general narrative of the Conquest is in no way affected ; and, if it be accepted, we may be sure that Vortigern's imitation of many Roman precedents did but hasten the progress of events. The attempts which had been checked while the Roman power was flourishing were sure to be renewed when the check was withdrawn, and if a Welsh King did invite a Jutish chieftain to defend him, that invitation was only the occasion, and not the cause, of the Conquest which now 449-597- began. We cannot seriously doubt that, in the course of the fifth and sixth centuries, a succession of tribes of kindred origin, all of them of the same Low-Dutch x stock, and speaking essentially the same Low-Dutch language, landed at various points of the British coast, that they gradually forced their way inland, and founded permanent Extent of Teutonic kingdoms. Before the end of the sixth century lish domi- the Teutonic dominion stretched from the German Ocean nion and of to the Severn, and from the English Channel to the Firth the mde- \u00b0 pendent 0f Forth. The northern part of the island was still held states at by Picts and Scots, Celtic tribes whose exact ethnical the sixth* ration to each other hardly concerns us.2 And the whole century. 1 I use, as a technical term, this correct and old-fashioned description of the class of languages to which our own belongs. The English language is simply Low-Dutch, with a very small Welsh, and a very large Romance, infusion into its vocabulary. The Low-Dutch of the continent, so closely cognate with our own tongue, is the natural speech of the whole region from Flanders to Holstein, and it has been carried by conquest over a large region, originally Slavonic, to the further east. But, hemmed in by Romance, High-Dutch, and Danish, it is giving way at all points, and it is only in Holland that it survives as a literary language. It should always be borne in mind that our affinity in blood and language is in the first degree with the Low-Dutch, in the second degree with the Danish. With the High-Dutch, the German of modern literature, we have no direct connexion at all. 2 The proper Scots, as no one denies, were a Gaelic colony from Ireland, the original Scotia. The only question is as to the Picts or Caledonians. Were they another Gaelic tribe, the vestige of a Gaelic occupation of the island earlier than the British occupation, or were they simply Britons who had never been brought under the Roman dominion? The geo-"], [57, "PROGRESS OF THE ENGLISH CONQUEST. 15 west side of the island, including not only modern Wales, chap. ii. but the great kingdom of Strathclyde, stretching from Dumbarton to Chester, and the great peninsula containing Cornwall, Devon, and part of Somerset, was still in the hands of independent Britons. The struggle had been long and hard, and the natives often kept their hold of a defensible district long after the surrounding country had been occupied by the invaders. It is therefore probable that, at the end of the sixth century and even later, there may have been within the English frontier inaccessible points where detached bodies of Welshmen still retained a precarious independence. It is probable also that, within the same frontier, there still were Roman towns, tributary to the conquerors rather than occupied by them.1 But by the end of the sixth century even these exceptions must have been few. The work of the Conquest, as a whole, The Eng was accomplished. The Teutonic settlers had occupied by quest, as far the greater part of the territory which they ever were, a whole' \u00b0 r \u25a0* J ' accom in the strictest sense, to occupy.

But the question is one which, as far as purely English history is concerned, may safely be left undetermined. 1 It seems certain that the English seldom occupied a Roman or British town at once. The towns were commonly forsaken for a while, though they were in many cases resettled by an English population. The only question is whether any of the towns preserved a sort of half independence after the conquest of the surrounding country.

The surviving Britons kept, and still keep, their own native language and not the language of their Roman conquerors. It would therefore seem that the Roman occupation of Britain was, after all, very superficial, and that, when the legions were withdrawn, the natives largely fell back into their ancient barbarism.

Had we conquered and settled only as Goths and Burgundians conquered and settled, we should be simply one more member of the great family of the Romance nations. Had we been a colony sent forth after the mother country had attained to any degree of civilization, we might have been lost like the Normans in Sicily or the Franks in Palestine. As it was, we were a colony sent forth while our race was still in a state of healthy barbarism. We won a country for ourselves, and we grew up, a new people in a new land, bringing with us ideas and principles common to us with the rest of our race, but not bringing with us any of the theories and prejudices which have been the bane of later colonization. Severed from the old stock, and kept aloof from intermixture with any other, we ceased to be Germans and we did not become Britons or Romans. In our new country we developed a new system for ourselves, partly by purely native growth, partly by independent intercourse with the common centre of civilization. The Goth is merged in the Romance population of Italy, Spain, and Aquitaine ; the Old-Saxon has lost his national being through the subtler proselytism of the High-German ; but the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, transplanted to the shores of Britain, have won for them selves a new name and a new national being, and have handed on to us the distinct and glorious inheritance of Englishmen. Thus, before the end of the sixth century, by far the Condition greater and more fertile portion of Britain had become at tne 'ei,,j"], [64, "FORMATION OF THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND. 22 chap. ii. heathen and Teutonic. The land had been occupied by \u00b0f the sixth various tribes; and most probably, as always happens in century. ' x such migrations, few bodies of settlers had been perfectly homogeneous. A certain following of allies or subjects of other races is almost sure to come in under the shadow of the main body. But it is clear that that main body was everywhere so distinctly and predominantly of Low-Dutch blood and speech as to swallow up any foreign elements which may have accompanied it during its migration, as well as any that it may have incorporated during the Thecoun- process of the Conquest or after its completion.

The old notion of an Heptarchy, of a regular system of The old seven kingdoms, united under the regular supremacy of a a regular single over-lord, is a dream which has passed away before Heptarchy the light of historic criticism. The English kingdoms in Britain were ever fluctuating, alike in their number and in their relations to one another.

Both these kingdoms have a large sea-board, but they are not, like Wessex, distinctly attributed to a personal founder from beyond sea. The first recorded King of the Northumbrians is Ida, who began to reign in 547 ; 4 1 I have given the boundaries somewhat roughly, as they do not always exactly answer to those of the present counties.

But we are not told, as in the cases of Hengest, \u00c6lle, and Cerdic, anything"], [68, "FORMATION OF THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND. 26 Chap. ii. the first recorded King of the East-Angles is Offa, who began to reign in 571.1 These dates give the beginnings of the kingdoms, but they do not give the beginnings of the English settlements in those countries. What Ida and Offa did was apparently to unite districts ruled by several independent, or at most confederated, Ealdormen into a Mercia. single kingdom. Meanwhile, in the middle of Britain, a 5 4 '\" 77' power equal to any of the others was growing up, in which the same process is still more plainly to be discerned. The kingdom of the Mercians, the march or border-land against the Welsh, appears at the end of the sixth century as a powerful state, but it has no distinctly recorded Peculiar founder, no distinctly recorded date of origin.2 It seems C II cL YQ, C T PT* of Mercia, to have grown up through the joining together of a great ofsmUli '\"n numDer 0I\" small principalities, probably of much move states of varied origin than the different portions of the other different , . , . . origins. kingdoms. The prevailing blood was Anglian ; but it is certain that the Mercian kingdom was considerably en larged by conquest at the expense of the Saxon race. The West-Saxon conquests north of the Thames and Avon were gradually cut off from the West-Saxon body, and about his landing, and the phrase \"Ida feng to rice\" (cf. 519) implies that this was not the beginning of the settlement. I therefore cannot help suspecting that there is some truth in the legend preserved by Nennius (38), according to which settlers of the kindred of Hengest occupied Northum berland in the preceding century. William of Malmesbury (i. 7) follows the same account, with additional details, but he distinctly adds that no English chief in those parts took the title of King before Ida. See Com parative Politics, 419. 1 The date of Offa is given by Henry of Huntingdon (Mon. Hist. Brit. 714 A). But he had before (M. H. B. 712 A) said, speaking of the days of Cerdic, '* ES tempestate venerunt multi et s\u00e6pe de Germania, et occupa verunt East- Angle et Merce : sed necdum sub uno rege redacta erant. Plures autem proceres certatim regiones occupabant.\" This marks the transition from Ealdormanship to Kingship, of which I shall speak in my next Chapter. 2 Crida or Creoda is mentioned in the Chronicles (593), but he is not said to have been the first King of the Mercians.

Wessex ties in the was an union of several kindred principalities, each having tin^doms its own Ealdorman or Under-king, though all were united under one supreme chief. At one time five West-Saxon Kings appear in a single battle.1 So in Kent there were Kings of East and West Kent, a fact which has left its memory in our ecclesiastical arrangements to the present day. No other English shire contains two bishoprics ; the two sees of Canterbury and Rochester still bear witness to the former existence of two distinct kingdoms within the present shire. So, in East-Anglia, the two divisions of the race, the North and the South Folk, have left their almost unaltered names to two modern counties. But in these cases the principalities seem to have been formed by separate, though kindred, detachments of colonists, each of them ruled by a prince of the one royal house. In Wessex each successive conquest from the Welsh seems to have formed a new principality; but the national unity of the West-Saxon people was never lost, and it does not appear that any but princes of the line of Cerdic ever ruled within their borders. But in Mercia a crowd of wholly independent principalities seem to have been gradually united under one common rule \u2014 a type of the fate which the whole island was destined to undergo, though not at the hands of Mercia.

II, The supre macy of the Bret waldas. unusual for the sovereign of one or other of these states to win, whether by arms or by persuasion, a certain dominion over the rest, a dominion which presented the aspect of an acknowledged, though probably not a very well-defined, supremacy. The famous title of Bretwalda1 appears to have been borne by the princes in whom such a supremacy was successively vested. Eight kings, of five different kingdoms, including all the seven except Essex and Mercia, are said to have possessed this supremacy over the rest of their fellows. The list, it should be remarked, does not form a continuous series, and it ends, after a considerable gap, with the prince who established in one kingdom a lasting supremacy over all the rest. The earlier names probably represent earlier attempts at establishing a supremacy of the same kind, a supremacy which was more or less fully ac knowledged at the time, but which the princes who held it failed to hand on to their successors. The early Bretwaldas and their dominion present us with the first foreshadowings of that union of the whole English race which was at last carried out by the West-Saxon Kings of the ninth and tenth centuries. \u00a7 2. Conversion of the English to Christianity. 597-681. The last years of the sixth century were marked by a change hardly less important than the first settlement of the Teutonic tribes in Britain. The Christian faith, which the English had hitherto despised or passed by unheeded as the creed of the conquered Welsh, was now set before them by a special mission from the city which still commanded the reverence of all Western Europe. Kent, under its King \u00c6thelberht, who then 1 On the list of Bretwaldas and its historic value, see Appendix B."], [71, "CONVERSION OF THE ENGLISH TO CHRISTIANITY. 29 held the rank of Bretwalda, became the first Christian chap. h. kingdom, and Canterbury became the first Christian city, 597' the spiritual metropolis of the English nation. To the vanquished Welsh the conquering Saxons and Angles had never listened ; but no sooner had the Roman Controver missionaries begun their work than another Christian tween tne element was brought in from the North, at the hands R\u00b0\"ianand of the already converted Picts and Scots. Sectarian parties. differences divided the two parties, and led to con troversies which threatened to tear the infant Church in pieces. Christian Kings and kingdoms apostatized; heathen Kings overthrew the champions of the new faith in battle ; but, amidst all these fluctuations, Christianity Christi gradually but steadily made its way. And in no part \u2122kes its of the world did Christianity make its way in a more way,ln J . England honourable manner. We nowhere read of any of those without persecutions, those conversions at the point of the sword, which disgraced the proselytizing zeal of the Frankish and Scandinavian apostles of the faith. *Of the first Christian prince in England, it is distinctly told us that, while still a heathen, he hindered none of his subjects from embracing Christianity, and that, after he was himself converted, he constrained none to forsake their ancient faith.1 In less than a century all the English kingdoms had fully accepted Christianity, and they had distinctly preferred its Roman to its Scottish form.

The supremacy of Kent at the beginning of the conversion, the supremacy of Northumberland at the stage when Christianity was first preached to the northern English, is still shown to this day in the metropolitan position of Canterbury, the city of the Bretwalda \u00c6thelberht, and of York, the city of the Bretwalda Eadwine. The land was speedily covered with churches and monasteries, the distinction between regulars and seculars being, during the missionary period, not very accurately drawn. Our forefathers soon acquired a fair share of the learning of the age, and the first two centuries after the conversion form a brilliant period in our ecclesiastical history, one which seems the more brilliant from the contrast with the time of renewed heathenism and darkness, which, in a large portion of Britain, was to follow it. CHAP. II. 597- 627. Effects of the conver sion of the English. The conversion of the English to Christianity at once altered their whole position in the world. Hitherto our history had been almost wholly insular ; our heathen fore fathers had had but little to do, either in war or in peace, with any nations beyond their own four seas. We hear little of any connexion being kept up between the Angles and Saxons who were settled in Britain, and their kins folk who abode in their older land.1 The little intercourse that we read of with the mainland seems to be wholly with the Franks who now bore rule on the opposite coast of Gaul. Englishmen seem once, in the sixth century, to have found their way to the Imperial court, but it was in company with the ambassadors of a Frankish prince, who at least tried to represent himself as the over-lord of Britain.2 One instance of connexion Their former isolated position.

English Kings then, and long after, commonly intermarried with English women, the daughters either of other English princes or of their own nobles. But the Bretwalda \u00c6thel berht, before the landing of Augustine, was already married to a Frankish princess, who retained her Christian religion in his heathen court. Such a fact is chiefly remarkable for its strangeness ; yet it points to a considerable amount of intercourse between Kent and the Franks of Paris at this particular moment. Still, up to the end of the sixth century, Britain, as a whole, was cut off from the rest of the world. It was a heathen and barbarous island, where the Christian faith was professed only by an obscure remnant, which, in some remote corners beyond the reach of the invaders, still retained a form of Christianity which, after all, was not the orthodoxy of the Old or of the New Rome. It was the conversion of our forefathers which brought England for the first time, not only within the pale of the Christian Church, but within the pale of the general political society of Europe. But our insular position, combined with the events of our earlier history, was not without its effect on the peculiar character of Christianity as established in England.

Strictly national Churches existed only in those lands of the further East, where the religious and the political loyalty of Syrians and Egyptians was already equally doubtful, and which were destined to fall away at the first touch of the victorious Saracen. In England, Error of alone in the West, a purely national Church arose. One ploving\" the great error indeed was committed; the vernacular tongue English no\u00a3 become the language of public worship. The language o o x i in public mistake was natural. It had occurred to no man to translate the Latin services, drawn up at a time when Latin was the universal language of the West, into those provincial dialects, the parents of the future Romance tongues, which were already growing up in Gaul and Spain. We should as soon think now of translating the Prayer-Book into the dialects of Somerset or Yorkshire. Led thus to look on Latin as the one tongue of worship, as well as of literature and government, Augustine and his successors failed to see that Teutonic England stood in a wholly different position from Romanized Gaul and Spain. They failed to see that the same reasons which required that men should pray in Latin at Rome required that they should pray in English at Canterbury. \u2022 The error was pardonable, but in its effects it was great. Still, though England had not vernacular services, she soon began to form a vernacular literature, sacred and profane, poetical and historical, to which no other nation of the West can supply a parallel. The English Church, reverencing Rome, but not slavishly bowing down to her, grew up with a distinctly national character, and gradually infused its influence into all the feelings and habits of the English people. By the end of the seventh century, the inde-"], [75, "QUESTION OF VERNACULAR SERVICES. 33 pendent, insular, Teutonic Church had become one of the chap. ii. brightest lights of the Christian firmament. In short, the introduction of Christianity completely changed the position of the English nation both within its own island and towards the rest of the world. From this time the amount of intercourse with other nations steadily increased, and the change of religion had also a most important effect within the island itself. The morality of Practical the Gospel had a direct influence upon the politics of the christi- age.

These northern conquests, as we have seen,1 were in a certain sense temporary; the districts overrun by Ceawlin beyond the Avon, like the other West-Saxon possessions north of the Thames, ceased for ever to be Welsh, but they did not become for ever West-Saxon. But the land between the Avon and the Axe, the northern part of modern Somerset, became an abiding part of the West-Saxon realm. This was the last heathen con quest, the last exterminating conquest, waged by the West-Saxons against the Britons. During a space of 1 See above, p. 25. VOL. I.

Everything J^\"^ looked as if the lasting dominion of Britain were destined nion. for Mercia, and even as if the faith of Christ were about to be plucked up out of the land before it had well taken root. But it was impossible that England should now fall back under the rule of a mere heathen conqueror. The dominion of Penda appears in our history as a mere passing tyranny, and, though he must have possessed more real power than any English prince had ever done before him, his name finds no place on the list of Bretwaldas. At last the seventh prince who bore that title, Oswiu of Death of Northumberland, checked him in his last invasion, and g55 slew him in the battle of Wingfield, a name which, obscure as it now sounds, marks an important turning- point in the history of our island. The strife between the creeds of Christ and of Woden was there finally decided ; the Mercians embraced the religion of their neighbours, and Northumberland again became the leading power of Britain. Under her two Bretwaldas, Oswald and Oswiu, Greatness . . n \u25a0 ofNorth- the English dominion was, seemingly for the first time, humber- extended beyond the Forth, and Picts and Scots, as well as o\"wa\"dacer English and Britons, admitted the supremacy of the Oswiu, an(1 & ' l j Eegfrith.

Eegfrith was slain in battle against the Picts ; 685. the northern dominion of Northumberland died with him, and the kingdom itself, which had been for a while the most flourishing and advancing state in Britain, was gradually weakened by internal divisions. It sank into utter insignificance, and stood ready, as we shall soon see, for the irruption of a new race of conquerors. After the Greatness of Mercia. decline of Northumberland, the Christian Mercians are 716_8i9. again seen on the road to that supremacy which had once 1 See Appendix B."], [82, "FORMATION OF THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND. 38 been so nearly grasped by their heathen forefathers. The fall of Penda carried with it a momentary subjugation of Mercia to Northumberland, but the land almost immedi ately recovered its independence, and in the next century Mercia again advanced from independence to dominion. Under three bold and enterprising Kings, \u00c6thelbald, Offa, and Cenwulf, the armies of Mercia went forth conquering and to conquer, and the periods of momentary confusion which divided these three vigorous reigns seem to have been no serious hindrance to the general advance of the kingdom. Wessex was still engaged in its long struggle with the Welsh, and was in no position to aspire to the dominion of Britain. It was quite as much as the West- Saxon Kings could do to push their conquests against the Welsh on the one hand and to maintain their independence against Mercia on the other. Wessex was more than once invaded by the Mercians ; at one time it became actually tributary; till Cuthred, in the middle of the eighth century, finally secured its independence in the fight of Burford. In the latter half of that century, Offa raised the Mercian kingdom to a greater degree of real power than it had ever held, even during the momentary dominion of Penda. He conquered from the Welsh the lands between the Severn and the Wye, a lasting and useful acquisition for the English nation, which he is said to have secured by the great dyke which still bears his name. On the other side of Britain, all the smaller states, East-Anglia, Essex, Kent, and Sussex, were brought more or less completely under his power. Victorious over all enemies within his own island, Offa, as the mightiest potentate of the West, corresponded on equal terms with the Great Charles, the mightiest potentate of the East.1 Occasional misunderstandings between the two princes seem not to have seriously interrupted their friendship.

But meanwhile the seeds of a mighty revolution were sowing. A prince, taught in the school of adversity, Accession who had learned the arts of war and statecraft at the feet berht of of the hero of the age, was, in the eighth year after Offa's death, raised to the throne of the West-Saxons.2 He was destined td win a dominion for which that narrow and local description seemed all too mean.

He could not indeed aspire, like Charles, to the diadem of the C\u00e6sars, but he could aspire to an ana- logous rank in an island which men sometimes counted for another world.

From this time forward, Wessex remained the undisputed head of the English nation. The power of the West- Saxon Kings might be assaulted, and at last overthrown, by foreign invaders, but it was never again disputed by rival Ecgberht potentates of English blood.

But Mercia was won only after a long Finai struggle. Ecgberht had inherited war with Mereia as st\u2122\u00bbgle an inheritance from his predecessors. The first year of Mercia. . 802-829. his reign, before he had himself come back to assume the crown to which he had been chosen, was marked by a successful resistance to a Mercian inroad.1 And even many years after, one of the greatest victories of his 825. reign, the fight of Ellandun, was a victory over Mercian invaders within the West - Saxon realm. That victory deprived Mercia of all her external dominion ; it was immediately after it that Ecgberht annexed the smaller kingdoms which had become Mercian dependencies. Four Submission years later, Mercia herself had to submit to the conqueror ; g she kept her Kings for nearly another half century, 830-874. but they now received their crown at the hands of the West-Saxon over-lord. It is immediately after recording this greatest of Ecgberht's triumphs that the Chronicles give him in a marked way the title of Bretwalda. It was immediately after the submission of Mercia that Ecgberht received the far more easily won submission of Northumberland, which completed his work of welding all the Teutonic kingdoms of Britain into one whole. But, while thus occupied, he had also to carry on the Successes usual warfare with his Celtic neighbours. The power berht over of the Cornish Britons was now utterly broken.

The Welsh however within the conquered territory still kept their distinct being, and they sometimes, with the aid of foreign invaders, strove to cast off the yoke. Against the North -Welsh,2 that is the inhabitants of Wales proper, Ecgberht was equally successful. As Lord of Mercia he inherited from the Mercian Kings a warfare against them as constant as that which he had inherited from his own ancestors against the Welsh of Cornwall. As soon therefore as he had established his supremacy over Mercia, he went on to require and to receive the submission of the Celtic neighbours of his new dominion. From this time forth all the Celtic inhabitants of Britain south of the Dee were vassals of the West-Saxon King. But his power never reached to the Picts, the Scots, or the Strathclyde Welsh. In fact, the northern Celts, except so far as they came in for their share of the Danish invasions, enjoyed about this time a century of unusual independence. The power of Northumberland had long been unequal to maintaining its old supremacy over its Celtic neighbours, and the new over -lord of Northumberland seems not to have attempted to enforce it. Ecgberht therefore, even at the height of his power, was not Lord of the whole isle of Britain. To win that title was the work of the West-Saxon conquerors of the next century. CHAP.

The Northern part of Europe, ' ' peopled by a race closely akin to the Low-Dutch and speaking another dialect of the common Teutonic speech, now began to send forth swarms of pirates over all the seas of Europe, who from pirates often grew into con querors.

It must however have had some considerable effect, as it is only quite towards the end of his reign that we hear of them again.

This period includes the time from the first recorded invasion Second till the latter half of the ninth century. Next comes settlement, a time in which the object of the Danes is clearly no 855-897- longer mere plunder, but settlement. They now, just as the English had done before them, come in much stronger bodies, and instead of sailing away every winter with their plunder, they make lasting settlements in a large part of the country. This took place in the second half of the ninth century. During the greater part of the tenth century we read of few or no fresh invasions from Scandinavia ; the energies of the Northern tribes were just now mainly devoted to those successive settle- ments in Gaul which formed the Duchy of Normandy.

With Norway chap. ii. also England proper had comparatively little to do, though the Northmen who ravaged and settled in Scotland and Ireland seem to have come mainly from that part of Scandinavia. But the history of England ( for a long term of years is one record of constant struggles with the power of Denmark. This forms the third period. We have passed the time of mere plunder ; we have passed the time of mere local settlement. We have now reached the time of political conquest, the time analogous to the conquests of the West- Saxon 994-1013. Kings from Cenwealh to Eadred. We now see a King of all Denmark bent on achieving the conquest of all England. We at last see the foreign invader succeeding in his attempt, and reigning as King of the English, 1013-1016. with the formal, though no doubt the constrained, assent of the English nation. Of these three periods, the third, as furnishing some of the immediate causes of the Norman Conquest, I must deal with in greater detail at a later stage of this history. The two earlier periods, those of mere plunder and of mere settlement, come within the bounds of the present preliminary sketch. The reigns of the son and the grandsons of Ecgberht were almost wholly taken up by the struggle with the Northmen. In the reign of \u00c6thelwulf the son of Reign of Ecgberht it is recorded that the heathen men wintered and for the first time in the Isle of Sheppey. This marks s\u2122s- . . .\u25a0'oz-y01 the transition from the first to the second period of 855. their invasions. Hitherto they had plundered and had gone away with their plunder ; to spend the winter on English soil was the first step towards a lasting settlement. It was not however till about eleven years 866. from this time that the settlement actually began. Meanwhile the sceptre of the West-Saxons passed from"], [90, "FORMATION OF THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND. 46 one hand to another. It is remarkable that no English king of this or of the following century seems to have reached old age. After \u00c6thelwulf, whose age is un certain, only one or two of his descendants for several generations reached the age of fifty, and the greater part of them wTere cut off while they were quite young. Four sons of \u00c6thelwulf reigned in succession, and the reigns of the first three among them make up together only thirteen years. In the reign of the third of these princes, \u00c6thelred the First, the second period of the invasions fairly begins. Five years were spent by the Northmen in ravaging and conquering the tributary kingdoms. Northumberland, still disputed between rival kings, fell an easy prey; one or two puppet princes did not scruple to receive a tributary crown at the hands of the heathen invaders.1 They next entered Mercia, they seized Nottingham, and the West -Saxon King, hastening to the relief of his vassals, was unable to dislodge them from that stronghold. East-Anglia was completely conquered, and its King Eadmund died a martyr. At last the full storm of invasion burst upon Wessex itself. King \u00c6thelred, the first of a long line of West- Saxon hero kings, supported by his greater brother \u00c6lfred, met the invaders in battle after battle with varied success. He died, and \u00c6lfred succeeded, in the thick of the struggle. In this year, the last of \u00c6thelred and the first of \u00c6lfred, nine pitched battles, besides smaller engagements, were fought with the heathens on West- Saxon ground. At last peace was made; the Danes withdrew to London, within the Mer cian frontier; Wessex was for a moment delivered, but the supremacy won by Ecgberht was lost. For a few years Wessex was subjected to nothing more than temporary incursions, but Deira or Southern Northum- CHAP. II. 858-871 Reign of \u00c6thelred, 866-871.

In Bernicia or Northern Northumberland English princes still reigned under Danish supremacy.

At Second in last the Danes, now settled in a large part of the Wessex. island, made a second attempt to add Wessex itself to S'Sm their possessions.

The shires, with at most two exceptions, are called after towns, and in most cases the shire groups itself round its capital, as round an acknowledged and con venient centre. The names of the old principalities vanish, and their boundaries are often disregarded. One principality is divided among several shires, and another shire is made up of several ancient principalities.

Saint Lewis comes nearest to him in the union of a more than monastic piety with the highest civil, military, and domestic virtues. \u00c6lfred and Lewis alike stand forth in honourable contrast to the abject superstition of some other royal saints, who were so selfishly engaged in the care of their own souls that they refused either to raise up heirs to their throne or to strike a blow on behalf of their people. But even in Saint Lewis we see a disposition to forsake an immediate sphere of duty for the sake of distant and unprofitable, however pious and glorious, undertakings. The true duties of a King of the French clearly lay in France and not in Egypt or at Tunis. No such charge lies at the door of the great King of the West-Saxons. With an inquiring spirit which took in the whole world, for purposes alike of scientific inquiry and of Christian benevolence, \u00c6lfred never forgot that his first duty was to his own people. He forestalled our own age in ex ploring the Northern Ocean, and in sending alms to the distant Churches of India; but he neither forsook his crown, like some of his predecessors, nor neglected its duties, like some of his successors. The virtue of \u00c6lfred, like the virtue of Washington, consisted in no marvellous displays of superhuman genius, but in the simple, straight forward, discharge of the duty of the moment. But to reformation, is part of the legend of Saint Neot, not of the history of \u00c6lfred. 1 No one can blame \u00c6lfred for hanging (see Chron. 897) the crews of some piratical Danish ships, who had broken their oaths to him over and over again.

And, when tried by such a standard, even the great Edward fails. Even in him we do not see the same wonderful union of gifts and virtues which so seldom meet together ; we cannot acquit Edward of occasional acts of violence, of occasional recklessness as to means ; we cannot attribute to him the pure, simple, almost childlike dis interestedness which marks the character of \u00c6lfred. The times indeed were different ; Edward had to tread the path of righteousness and honour in a time of far more tangled policy, and amidst temptations, not harder indeed, but far more subtle. The legislative merits of Edward are greater \u00c6lfred's than those of \u00c6lfred ; but this is a difference in the times as a i^. rather than in the men. The popular error which makes lator ; \u00c6lfred the personal author of all our institutions hardly needs a fresh confutation. Popular legends attribute to him the invention of Trial by Jury and of countless other portions of our law, the germs of which may be discerned ages before the time of \u00c6lfred, while their existing shapes cannot be discerned till ages after him. \u00c6lfred, like so E 2"], [96, "FORMATION OF THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND. 52 chap, ii, as scholar. many of our early kings, collected and codified the laws of his predecessors; but wTe have his own personal witness1 that he purposely abstained from any large amount of strictly new legislation. The legislation of Edward, on the other hand, in its boldness and originality, forms the most marked of all epochs in the history of our law. It is perhaps, after all, in his literary aspect that the distinctive beauty of \u00c6lfred's character shines forth most clearly. The mere patronage of learning was common to him with many princes of his age. Both Charles the Great and several of his successors had set brilliant examples in this way. Wrhat distinguished \u00c6lfred was his own personal appearance as an author. Now, as a rule, literary kings have not been a class deserving of much honour. They have commonly stepped out of their natural sphere only to display the least honourable characteristics of another calling. But it was not so with the Emperor Marcus ; it was not so with our \u00c6lfred. In \u00c6lfred there is no sign of literary pedantry, ostentation, or jealousy ; nothing is done for his own glory ; he writes, just as he fights and legis lates, with a single eye to the good of his people. He shows no signs of original genius ; he is simply an editor and translator, working honestly for the improvement of the subjects whom he loved.

And he was Happiness specially happy in handing on a large share of his genius hia^suc and his virtue to those who came after him. The West- ce8Sors- Saxon kings, for nearly a century, form one of the most brilliant royal lines on record. From \u00c6thelred the Saint to Eadgar the Peaceful, the short and wretched reign of Eadwig is the only interruption to one continued display of valour under the guidance of wisdom. The greatness of the dynasty, obscured under the second \u00c6thelred, flashes forth for a moment in the short and glorious career of the second Eadmund.

Looking at \u00c6lfred as Bretwalda, a West title which had passed away, or as King of the English, a title which he hardly ventured to assume, his loss was beyond expression. But, as local King of the West-Saxons, he undoubtedly gained. The Danes were nominally his vassals ; J but their vassalage was so purely nominal that 1 Guthrum of East-Anglia was a nominal vassal all along.

The successors of \u00c6lfred were gradually enabled to win back the supremacy established by Ecg berht, and to enlarge it into an actual sovereignty over all England and an acknowledged supremacy over all Britain. The kingdom so formed was at last overcome by a Danish conqueror ; but it was overcome by a very different process from the settlement of this or that wandering pirate.

His"], [101, "REIGN OF EADWARD THE ELDER. 57 whole reign bears out the panegyric passed on him by chap. n. an ancient writer,1 that he was fully his father's equal as a warrior and ruler, and was inferior to him in nothing except those literary labours which were so peculiarly \u00c6lfred's own. The work of Eadward was twofold ; he enlarged the borders of his immediate kingdom, and he brought the whole island under vassalage. His wars, and those of his three successors, were, it should be re membered, waged mainly against the Danes settled in Britain. These settlers were sometimes helped by their brethren from Denmark, and more commonly by the Danes and Northmen settled in Ireland ; but, on the whole, foreign invasions do not form an important feature in the events of this half-century. The war began when the Alliance of Northumbrian Danes took the part of a defeated candidate wjth * he1 for the West-Saxon crown,2 who did not scruple to accept Danes- 901-905. their alliance, and to lead them to plunder and attempted conquest against his own countrymen. But Eadward, when thus put on the defensive, did something more than merely defend the kingdom which he had received from his father.

The submission of Scotland and Strathclyde to chap. k. Eadward is the most distinctive feature in Eadward's reign. It was something which surpassed the greatest exploits of his predecessors. The Scots had recognized a precarious supremacy in the old Northumbrian Kings. They had recognized a supremacy yet more precarious still in the great Frankish Emperor. But their sub mission to Wessex was wholly new ; the days had long passed when they had bowed to an over-lord at York, and they had never before bowed to an over-lord at Winchester. This commendation of Scotland to the West- Vassalage Saxon King is an event so important for the history of iana. the next four hundred years, and it is an event which is924-r32 . often so completely misunderstood, that I must reserve some consideration of its exact bearing for my next Chapter. It is enough to say here that, from this time to the fourteenth century, the vassalage of Scotland was an essential part of the public law of the isle of Britain. No doubt many attempts were made to cast off the de pendent relation which had been voluntarily incurred ; but when a King of the English had once been chosen \" to father and to lord,\" his successors never willingly gave up the position which had thus been bestowed upon them. Whenever the King of the English is strong enough, he always appears as the acknowledged superior of the King of Scots. Kenneth acts the part 973. of a faithful vassal to Eadgar. Eadward the Confessor, like his nobler namesakes before and after, acts as superior lord and, as such, transfers the tributary crown from an 1054. usurper to the lawful heir. When the Norman William 1072. had subdued England, he claimed and received the homage of Scotland as one of the undoubted rights of the crown which he had won. And nothing is clearer than that Homage this homage was paid, not only for Cumberland or Lothian, Scotland but for the true kingdom of the Celtic Picts and Scots. ProPer-"], [104, "FORMATION OF THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND. 60 chap. h. In the days of Eadward and \u00c6thelstan, Lothian was still English or Danish, an integral part of the kingdom of Northumberland, and the submission of Strathclyde was the separate act of another independent prince. The facts are undoubted ; they are plain matters of history, which ought never to be looked at through the medium of pro- vincial prejudice. The vassalage of Scotland to England is as certain as the earlier vassalage of Mercia to Wessex ; but, for the last hundred and sixty years, one fact has been of as little practical importance as the other. \u00a7 5.

The reign of this great Foreign prince is also remarkable for the brilliant position which of \u00c6thel^ England now held with regard to foreign countries. Con- stan trary to the usual custom of English Kings, \u00c6thelstan, himself childless, systematically formed family connexions with the chief powers of Europe. His numerous sisters were married to a crowd of princes, ranging in dignity [Marriage from Sihtric, the momentary King of the Northumbrians, 9'9' ... .\u201e Otto King, to Otto, who placed his English wife on the throne of the 936.

With some degree of exaggeration of the real facts, the court of \"glorious \u00c6thelstan\" is painted to us as the common refuge of oppressed princes and as the school where the scions of royalty learned the lessons which befitted kings and warriors.

The Northumbrian Danes were constantly revolting, constantly setting up kings of their own, and they were as constantly brought back to submission by the superior power of the Emperor3 of Britain. At last, under Eadred, the rebel lious land was finally subdued, the last phantom of North humbrian royalty vanished, and the whole land beyond the Humber was for the future ruled by Earls of the King's appointment. Another success, hardly less valu able, was the final recovery of the Five Boroughs by Eadmund ; a poetical entry in the Chronicles vividly paints the delight of their English inhabitants at their deliverance from the yoke of their heathen masters.4 The relations of Scotland to the Imperial power seem, after the great defeat of Brunanburh, to have remained friendly for many years.

See also Appendix B. * Leicester (Chron. 918), Stamford (922), and Nottingham (924) were all in possession of Eadward, who built fortresses at the latter two. Perhaps they had joined in the revolt of the Northumbrians in 941 ; but the words of the Chronicles may lead us to think that Eadward accepted the submis sion of the Confederation and built forts to keep the towns from rebellion, without interfering with their internal administration.

That the Scots renewed 946. their oaths on the accession of Eadred is no proof of hostile feelings on either side ; it was merely an usual and neces sary precaution at the beginning of a new reign, doubly necessary when Northumberland was in rebellion. The work begun by Ecgberht was now finally accomplished. The King of the West-Saxons had grown step by step into the acknowledged King of the English and Emperor of the Isle of Albion. A time now came when it seemed for a moment that that work was about to be undone, and that the blow was struck in the very hearth and home of the English Empire. For a moment Wessex and Mercia were again divided. The events of the next reign are recorded with a singular amount of contradiction,2 and the voice to which we should have listened with undoubting confidence is all but silent.3 But as far as can be made Succession out, the two young sons of Eadmund succeeded their uncle ;n wessex Eadred, the elder, Eadwig, reigning in Wessex as superior ' > o' o o 1 m Mercia. lord, while the younger, Eadgar, reigned as Under-king 955 north of the Thames. From the stirring tale of an Empire saved, consolidated, and defended by the unwearied efforts of six wise and valiant monarchs, we turn to find ourselves involved in the thick of an ecclesiastical controversy. Dunstan, a name known to too many readers only as the Dunstan. subject of one of the silliest of monastic legends, stands forth as the leading man in Church and State. As the 1 See Appendix H. 2 On the whole reign of Eadwig, see Mr. Allen's Essay attached to his work on the Royal Prerogative. * The entries in the Chronicles just at this time are singularly meagre."], [108, "FORMATION OF THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND. 64 chap. ii. minister of Eadred and of Eadgar, as the Jehoiada or Character Seneca who watched over the still harmless childhood of policy. the second \u00c6thelred, Dunstan is entitled to lasting and honourable renown. The ecclesiastical changes which are commonly connected with his name, but which perhaps rather belong to contemporary prelates like Oda of Canter bury and \u00c6thelwald of Winchester, are of a more doubtful character. To bring back the monks to the observance of their rule, to raise the character of the secular clergy, often no doubt ignorant and worthless enough, were thoroughly praiseworthy undertakings. But the complete prohibition of clerical marriage, the substitution of regulars for secu lars in many of the cathedral and other chief churches of England, were certainly the works of a zeal which had far outrun discretion. And these measures had also the effect of dividing the nation into two parties, and of pro ducing an amount of mutual hostility which might well have led to even greater evils than it did lead to. The whole of the short reign of Eadwig is shrouded in mystery; but it is clear that he was the enemy of Dunstan, perhaps to some extent the enemy of the monks generally, and it is certain that he was the vigorous opponent of the policy which strove everywhere to substitute monks for secular 956. canons. The banishment of Dunstan, combined with an uncanonical marriage, seems to have' roused popular feeling against a prince on whose real merits we are hardly in a Eadgar position to pronounce a judgement.

Under Eadgar too England intercourse held a high place in the estimation of foreign lands, and J^ intercourse with them, commercial and otherwise, was countries, carefully promoted by his enlightened policy.4 In eccle- siastical matters the party of the regulars was steadily favoured. This fact may perhaps have won for Eadgar more than his due share of praise at the hands of monastic writers.

In his time too begins that direct and intimate connexion between English and Norman history which shows that we are now approaching the days of the Norman Conquest, and that we have reached the first links in the chain of its direct causes. The reign of \u00c6thelred will therefore claim a somewhat fuller treatment than that of a preliminary sketch. We have thus traced out the steps by which the West- Recapitu- Saxon Kings, from Ecgberht onwards, founded that King- dom of England which one conquest was to hand over to the King of the Danes and another conquest to the Duke of the Normans, but which was never again to be per- manently divided, and which each conquest only served to unite more firmly. We have seen also how, along with the consolidation of their Teutonic kingdom, the same West-Saxon princes obtained a more extended and more precarious Empire over their Celtic neighbours. The later fate of the various Celtic portions of Britain has been widely different. In Cumberland no sign is left, and in Cornwall not many, that the dominion of the English King was once that of an external over-lord and not that of an immediate sovereign.

Strange to say, the little realm of Man is the only part of the Empire of Eadgar which is not now thoroughly fused into the general mass of the United Kingdom.1 But different as has been the later fate of the various portions of the dominions of Eadgar, his Teutonic Kingdom and his Celtic Empire both passed nearly untouched into the hands of the Norman Conqueror. In another preliminary Chapter I shall attempt a general picture of the condition and constitution of the Kingdom and Empire which were thus transferred. I shall then give some account of the history of Normandy up to the point which I have now reached in the history of England. I shall then be ready to go on with the more detailed history of the Norman Conquest itself and of the causes which immediately led to it, beginning with the reign of \u00c6thelred the Second. 1 As long as Man retained its separate Kings or even its separate Lords, it was strictly in the same position in which it was in the days of Eadgar. Even now, as retaining its own Legislature and not being represented in the Imperial Parliament, it is a dependency of the British Crown, like the Channel Islands, not an integral part of the United Kingdom, like England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland."], [113, "CHAPTEK III.

The early political and legal antiquities of England have been treated of by so many eminent writers that there is really little more to be done than to test their different views by the standards of inherent probability and of documentary evidence, and to decide which has the best claim to adoption. Among many other works two stand out conspicuously, Sir Francis Palgrave's History of the English Commonwealth and Mr. Kemble's Saxons in Eng land. My readers will easily see that I have learned much from both, but that I cannot call myself an unreserved follower of either. Another most important work is Dr. Reinhold Schmid's Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen (2nd ed. Leipzig, 1858). The most valuable part is the Antiquarian Glossary, the principal articles of which swell into essays on the most important subjects suggested by the Old-English Laws, supported by the most lavish array of references for every detail. On the whole I think I shall be commonly found maintaining the same constitutional views as Mr. Kemble, except on the point of the Imperial character of the Old-English monarchy, an aspect of it which Mr. Kemble has rather unaccountably slurred over. This point, one which closely connects itself with other studies of mine, is perhaps the one which I have thought out more thoroughly for myself than any other. Sir Francis Palgrave, with his characteristic union of research, daring, and ingenuity, was the first to call attention to the subject ; but I must confess that many of his views on the matter seem to me not a little exaggerated.

I wish merely to give such a sketch of the political condition of England, at the time when England and Normandy began to influence each other's affairs, as may make the narrative of their mutual intercourse intel ligible. What the constitution was under Eadgar, that it remained under William. This assertion must be taken with all the practical drawbacks which are involved in the forcible transfer of the crown to a foreign dynasty, and in the division of the greater part of the lands of the king dom among the followers of the foreign King. But the constitution remained the same ; the laws, with a few changes in detail, remained the same ; the language of public documents remained the same. The powers which were vested in King William and his Witan remained constitutionally the same as those which had been vested in King Eadgar and his Witan a hundred years before. The change in the social condition of the country, the change in the spirit of the national and local administra tion, the change in the relation of the kingdom to foreign lands, were changes as great as words can express. The practical effect of these changes was a vast increase of the royal power, and the introduction of wholly new relations between the King and every class of his subjects. But formal constitutional change there was none. I cannot too often repeat, for the saying is the very summing up of the whole histoiy, that the Norman Conquest was not the wiping out of the constitution, the laws, the language, the national life of Englishmen.

Many of them are the work of lawgivers legis- suits 0f tj,e lating for a new state of things, and, in not a few cases, Comluest confirming or restoring ancient English institutions under foreign names. Many of them are due to the ingenuity of lawyers whose minds were full of theories of law wholly alien to the principles of ancient English jurisprudence. All these changes were in some sort the final results of the Conquest. Some of them were actually caused by the Conquest ; others were hastened by it. But of very few indeed was it the direct and immediate cause. The Eng- Change in lisli kingship gradually changed from a kingship of the arcny old Teutonic type into a kingship of the later medi\u00e6val [j1^ type.

Such a ype' change was not, and could not be, the work of one man or of one generation. But English kingship, like the other main features of the English polity, may be said to have fully put on its later form when the absent Edward was proclaimed in the place of his father, when the King was for the first time held to reign before he had received the rite which clothed him with the kingly office. \u00a7 1.

Summary We have already traced the course of the events by which growth of those powers, internal and external, grew up. Two Saxon essex. chiefS) Ealdormen or Heretogan, formed a settlement on the south coast of Britain. After some years of successful warfare, they assumed the kingly title over their own 519- tribe.1 One of their successors incorporated some of the 823-828. other Teutonic kingdoms with his own realm, and obtained an external supremacy over all the other Teutons in the island and over a portion of the Celts. A series of his 878-954. successors, after long struggles, incorporated all the Teutonic states into one kingdom, and obtained an external Empire over all the Celtic states. The Ealdorman of the Gewissas thus gradually grew into the King of the West- Saxons, the King of the Saxons,2 the King of the English, the Emperor of all Britain. The external aspect of this process, the dates of its several stages, I have already marked. I must now dwell a little longer on the real origin and nature of the various powers implied in those different descriptions of the ruler. Each stage marks an advance in the extent of territorial dominion ; each stage marks also an advance in the amount of political authority enjoyed by the sovereign. Modern political controver sies alien to the In following up these researches into our earliest poli tical antiquities it is absolutely necessary to cast away all thoughts of modern political controversies.

To this day a popular orator will some times think that he adds point to a declamation by bring ing in Saxon \u00c6lfred as the author of Trial by Jury, perhaps of every other privilege which other lands are held either not to possess or to have borrowed from our selves. Every notion of this kind must be wholly cast away, if we would fairly and impartially learn what the institutions of our Teutonic forefathers really were.

Let him go as far back as history or tradition throws any light on the institutions of our race, and he will find the germs alike of the monarchic, the aristocratic, and the democratic branches of our constitution. When positive evidence within our own land fails us, we must go for illustration and explanation, not to the facts, the theories, the con troversies, of modern politics, but to the kindred insti tutions of the kindred nations of the mainland. Our Parliament is the true and lawful representative, by true and lawful succession, of the ancient Meeting of the Wise ; but, if we would search out the origin and constitution of that Meeting of the Wise, we must go, not to the par liamentary traditions of the last six hundred years, but to the Mar zf eld of the Frankish Kings, to the Landes gemeinden of Schwyz and Uri, to those yet earlier assem blies which still rise before us in full life in the pages of the first inquirer into the habits and institutions of our race. From the Germania of Tacitus onwards, through the Barbaric Codes, through the Capitularies of the Frankish Kings and Emperors, through the records of our own insular legislation from the Dooms of \u00c6thelberht to the so-called Laws of Henry the First, we have a series of witnesses, showing what were the general principles of Teutonic law, and what were the particular forms which it took in particular times and places. In truth we may go beyond the records of our own immediate race. The early history of the Teuton is constantly illustrated by the early history of his Aryan kinsmen, and the living picture of the old Achaians of Homer brings vividly before us many an institution of our own forefathers and many an incident of their early history.

The sketch which has been given in the last Chapter has shown that the Imperial lordship of all Britain, as Origin of Teutonic kingship."], [119, "ORIGIN OF KINGSHIP. 75 held by \u00c6thelstan and his successors, and even the supre- chap. hi. macy of Wessex over the other English kingdoms, as established by Ecgberht, were institutions of comparatively late growth. But it must not be thought that even the full-grown local kingship, such as we find it held by \u00c6thelberht in Kent and by Eadwine in Northumberland, was a thing which had been from the beginning. In the days of Tacitus some of the Teutonic tribes had kings and others had not ; in the time of C\u00e6sar it would seem that Kingship . . not univer kingship was the exception and not the rule.1 The chief- sal ; go tains of the first settlers in our own island bore no higher by\u2122\u2122^,.. title than Ealdorman or Heretoga. These two names ex- \u2122el1 or Heretogan. press two different sides of the same office. The same man is Ealdorman as a civil ruler and Heretoga as a military chieftain. The former name survives in our Force and language, but with sadly diminished dignity ; the title tng Uames. which once expressed a rank which, among worldly dig nities, was inferior to kingship alone, has taken refuge with a class of municipal magistrates, reaching downwards to the pettiest boroughs. The other name, always much more rarely in use, has dropped altogether out of our tongue, while, among the continental Teutons, the cognate word Herzog expresses a dignity the distinction between which and modern kingship must be drawn by the courtier and not by the politician. The name of Ealdorman is one of a large class ; among a primitive people age implies command and command implies age ; hence, in a somewhat later stage of language, the elders are simply the rulers, and the eldest are the highest in rank, without any thought of the number o'f years which they may really have lived. It is not perfectly clear in what the authority or dignity Import of of the King exceeded that of the Ealdorman, but it is clear {r^-^f.e that the title of King did carry with it an advance in \u00a3\u00b0\u2122n to both respects. Even the smallest kingdom was probably 1 On all these points see Appendix K."], [120, "THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. 76 chap. in. formed by the union of the districts of several Ealdormen. It is probable too that the King was distinguished by some religious sanction of heathen times, analogous to the ecclesiastical consecration which in later times the Church bestowed on kings, but not on princes of lower rank. It is certain that kingship required descent from the Gods; it may be that no such divine origin was Instances needed by the mere Ealdorman. At all events, we find and else- the change from Ealdorman to Kings taking place in more where. tastn one kingdom of Teutonic Britain, as well as among many of the kindred tribes on the mainland.

His relation to his over-lord binds him dent King. to certain external services, but in his internal government he remains perfectly independent, with his power limited only by the laws of his own realm. But the Ealdorman has become distinctly a subject. He may hold the fullest royal power within his own district ; he may be the de scendant of former Ealdormen and even of former Kings ; he may have a reasonable hope that he may hand on his dignity to his own children ; still he is not a sovereign, but a subject. The King is supreme ; the Ealdorman is simply sent by him. He is a Viceroy appointed by the King and his Witan; he is liable to be removed by them, and he is responsible to them for the exercise of his authority. When the kingdom of Mercia was broken up, Position of \u00c6lfred entrusted the government of the part which fell \u00c6thelred to his share to his son-in-law \u00c6thelred as Ealdorman. \u2122\u201e ff\u201ela' 800-912. \u00c6thelred was a man of royal descent ; he exercised full royal power in Mercia; but he exercised it simply as a Governor- General or Lord-Lieutenant, the representative of a sovereign whose higher authority he carefully acknow ledges in his charters.1 So, when Northumberland was Case of , , , .

It is not found in the earliest Teutonic prose writing, the Gothic Gospels ; but in our own language it seems to be as old as the English settlements in Britain. Most of the questions which have arisen as to the etymology of the word only show how modern a thing scientific etymology is.3 Cyning, by con traction King, comes from the same root as the word cyn or kin. And the connexion is not without an important meaning. The King is the representative of the race, the embodiment of its national being. A King, in the old Teutonic sense, is not the King of a country, but the King of a nation. Such titles as King of England or King of France are comparatively modern, and the idea which they express is equally so.4 The Teutonic King is not the lord of the soil, but the leader of the people. The idea of the King of a country would have been hardly intelligible to our forefathers. Every King is King of a people. He is King of Goths, Franks, Saxons, wherever Goths, Franks, Saxons, may happen to settle.

So most people are inclined to undervalue the position of our Ceorlas.

Of the nature and functions of such an assembly I shall have presently to speak, when I trace out the origin and nature of the Old-English Witenagemot. My present point is the dis- Distinction tinction of orders in the state. Tacitus sets before us a and Ceorl. marked distinction between the noble and the common freeman, that is, in Old-English phrase, between the Eorl and the Ceorl. The modern English forms of these words have altogether lost their ancient meaning. The word Earl, after several fluctuations, has settled down as the title of one rank in the peerage; the word Churl has come to be a word of moral reprobation, irrespective of the rank of the person who is guilty of the offence. But in the earlier meaning of the words, Eorl and Ceorl \u2014 words whose happy jingle causes them to be constantly opposed to each other \u2014 form an exhaustive division of the free members of the state. The distinction in modern lan- guage is most nearly expressed by the words Gentle and Simple. The ceorl is the simple freeman, the mere unit in the army or in the assembly, whom no distinction of birth or office marks out from his fellows. It must not be forgotten that, among the ancient English, as among all other Teutonic nations, the system of slavery was in full force. The ceorl therefore, like the ancient Greek citizen, though he might be looked down upon by an aristocratic class, was actually a privileged person as com- pared with a large number of human beings in his own city or district.1 The origin of the distinction it is in vain to search after ; the difference of the eorl and the ceorl is a primary fact from which we start; it is as old as the earliest notices of Teutonic institutions, and the 1 See History of Federal Government, i. 37-38."], [127, "EORL AS AND CEORL AS. 83 only attempt at its explanation is to be found in an in- chap. hi. genious mythical story in a Northern saga.1 Nor is it very easy to see in what the privileges of the eorl con sisted, or how far they were secured by definite laws. Perhaps we may gain some light by looking at those Analogy communities which have preserved the old Teutonic system mocratjc of government with the least alteration, the democratic Cantons of \u00b0 bwitzer- Cantons of Switzerland.2 There, amid the purest demo- land. cracy in the world, where every adult freeman has a direct Traditlonal J J predomi and equal vote in the Assembly, we still find that certain nance of families, enjoying no legal privileges above their fellows, families. were long held in a kind of hereditary reverence, and that members of those families were preferred above all others to the highest offices in the state. Such were the houses of Reding in Schwyz, of Tschudi in Glarus, of the Barons of Attinghausen in Uri. The office of Landammann, the chief magistracy of the commonwealth, conferred by the yearly vote of the Landesgemeinde, commonly fell to the lot of members of these great houses ; the same man was constantly re-elected year after year, and, when he died, his son was often elected in his place. Or without going Compari so far from home, we may see what is essentially the same county\u00b0 thing in the position of old county families, holding no famuieB or J o among legal advantages above their fellows, but which still enjoy ourselves. 1 The story is in the Rig's-mal, and will be found in the English trans lation of Mallet's Northern Antiquities, p. 365. Jarl, Karl, and Thr\u00e6ll, all born on one day through the power of the God Helmdall, are the respective ancestors of the three classes of men, eorls, ceorls, and thralls or slaves. Karl, among other sons, has Husbandman, Holder, and Smith. 2 Of the history and constitution of these commonwealths I trust to treat more at large in the second volume of my History of Federal Govern ment. I will now only say that, though the amount of independence en joyed by the ancient Cantons has often been greatly exaggerated, there is evidence enough to show that, in some districts at least, the old Teutonic system can be traced back uninterruptedly as far as we have any records at all, so that we may fairly presume an unbroken succession from the Germans of Tacitus.

The eorl and the ceorl in fact answer pretty nearly to the esquire and the yeoman;1 the modern artificial peerage is something quite different, and we shall presently perhaps see its beginnings. The primitive Teutonic community is thus set before us as one consisting of eorls and ceorls, headed by a King, Ealdorman, or other leader, temporary or permanent, elective or hereditary. Such a community occupies its own territory, its Mark,2 which territory consists of land of two kinds. There is the common land, either applied to the general use of the community or else held by individuals on such terms as the community, in its character of land owner, may think good to allow. There are also the par ticular possessions of individuals, portions assigned to them by common consent, which are the absolute property of their owners, held of no superior, but simply subject to such burthens as the community, in its political character, may think good to impose on its members. All this again is in no way distinctively Teutonic ; it is the story of the ancient commonwealths of Greece and Italy over again. The folkland 3 of England and the ager publicus of Borne are the same thing. The English and the Latin names translate one another ; they both describe the land which 1 This comparison may surprise some who have been accustomed to look on the ceorlas ns a very degraded class. There can be no doubt that among the ceorlas there were men of very different positions, that the general tendency of their position was to sink, and that, by the time of the Norman Conquest, some classes of them had advanced a good way on the road to serfdom. But this was not the condition of the whole order even then ; still less was it the original conception of ceorldom. The original ceorl is a citizen and a soldier ; he is, or may be, a landowner ; on the one hand he is free, on the other he is not noble. See the remarks in Hallam's Supplementary Notes already referred to. 2 See Mr. Kemble's Chapter on \" The Mark \" in the first volume of The Saxons in England. 3 To Mr. Allen (Royal Prerogative, p. 129) belongs the honour of having first explained what folkland and boohland really were."], [129, "FOLKLAND. 85 still belongs to the community as a body, and of which chap. hi. individuals cannot be more than the occupiers.1 The whole history of the Roman Agrarian Laws, so long misunder stood, turns simply on the regulation of this common land of the state. In the time of C\u00e6sar it would seem that the whole territory of a Teutonic community was folkland ; individuals could obtain no right in it beyond that of a yearly tenancy.2 But the custom of allotting portions of the common stock in absolute property gradually advanced. A conquest like that of Britain would be highly favourable to the growth of the practice. When a band of Teutonic warriors took possession of a district and slew or dispos sessed its former inhabitants, we cannot doubt that, besides the stock reserved as common property, each man who had Allodial borne his share in the labours and dangers of the conquest e%ei or would claim his reward in the absolute ownership of some portion of the conquered territory. The eorls, who would doubtless act as the leaders of the expedition, may well have received a larger allotment ; but we may be sure that no freeman bearing arms went altogether without some share of the spoil. Such an allotment in absolute property, held of no superior, subject to nothing but the laws of the state, is called in different Teutonic dialects e%el, odal, or alod. It is an estate, great or small, which the owner does not hold either of the King or of any other lord, but in regard to which he knows no superior but God and the law.

Everywhere else it is as much as we can do to trace out some faint footsteps of the ancient system, such as we see in common lands, in some forms of communal institutions, in petty and half obsolete local the Comi- tribunals.

The followers served their chief in peace and in war ; they fought for him to the death, and rescued or avenged his Nature life with their own.

The service of the King or other great lord conferred dignity even on the freeman. This is a notion altogether foreign to the ideas of republican Greece and Rome ; but here again the primitive Teuton is but the reproduction of the primitive Achaian. The Homeric Homeric Kings have their comitatus, their Gesr&as or krcupoi, their pegnas or Qtpanovres, free, noble, the cherished companions of their lords, but who do for those lords, without any loss of. their own dignity, services which in later Greece none but slaves would have rendered. Eteoneus, Automedon,2 feminine Hl\u00e6fdige (Lady) is more puzzling still. But it is enough for my purpose, if a connexion with Hldf in any shape be admitted, whatever may be thought of the last syllable. 1 Maine, Ancient Law, 303. \"The person who ministered to the sovereign in his court had given up something of that absolute personal freedom which was the proudest privilege of the allodial proprietor.\" 2 Horn.

Ill, Contrast with the republican Greeks and Romans. Meriones, the divine Patroklos himself, all appear in this relation ; all are connected by this voluntary personal tie to a chieftain of higher rank. They are the very counter parts of Lilla, the faithful Thegn of Eadwine,1 and of those true companions who fought to the death for Cynewulf and Cyneheard.2 The republican Greek knew no lord but the law.3 He was a member of a civil com munity, and as a good citizen he obeyed the magistrates whom the choice of the community clothed with a limited and temporary power. But personal dependence on another human being seemed to him the distinguishing mark of the slave as opposed to the citizen. The republican Roman shared the same feeling ; the early C\u00e6sars were served by slaves or freedmen ; 4 it was only as the Empire gradually grew into an avowed monarchy, and gradually assumed somewhat of the pomp of eastern kingship, that service about the person of the Emperor began to be looked upon as honourable in a man of free Roman birth. In the Teuton, as in the Homeric Achaian, the feeling of the civil community, though far from unknown, was less strong, and the tie of personal dependence was not felt to imply degradation. Indeed the Teuton carried the principle of personal service far further than the Roman ever did. It was held that purely menial services, when rendered to persons of higher rank, in no way degraded the ordinary freeman. It was even held that men of any rank short of the highest were actually honoured by rendering such services to those who were one degree higher than them- 1 B\u00e6da, ii. 9. \" Lilla minister (}>egn) Regis amicissimus.\" He saves his hlaford's Use at the cost of his own. 2 See this most remarkable story in the Chronicles, 755 ; Florence, 784. 3 Herod, vii. 104. eireari yap aipi Scairbrns vopos, rbv inroSupaivovoi iruAAaJ en p&Wov t) ot ffol ae. * Of this feeling, and the gradual change as the Empire advanced, I have spoken in Historical Essays, Second Series, p. 317.

The Thegn, whose name might sound at first hearing like the exact opposite of the ancient Eorl, gradually took his place. The word Thegn became equivalent to nolle or gentle. The King's Thegns formed the highest class of gentry; the Thegns of Ealdormen and Bishops formed a lower class. Again to use a modern parallel, the ancient Eorl answers to the gentleman of ancient family, looked at simply as the descendant of certain forefathers and the owner of certain property; the Thegn answers to the gentleman, whether with or without such ancestry, looked at as holding, by royal commission, his place in the local magis- tracy and the local military force. 1 Mr. Kemble however (ii. 1 1 2) remarks that the greatest men of the kingdom, men like Godwine, Leofric, and Siward, seem never to have held such offices. So in our own day a man who had any chance of becoming First Lord of the Treasury would not stoop to become Lord Chamberlain or Master of the Horse. 2 See Appendix 0,"], [134, "THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. 90 chap. in.

But though individual Ceorls might thus rise, there can be no doubt that the growth of the Thegnhood was on the whole depressing to the Ceorls, the simple freemen, as a class. The idea of the simple landman \u2014 I must borrow a word from our continental brethren, as the word citizen brings in quite other ideas \u2014 the undistinguished, but still free and, in a sense, equal member of a free community, gradually died out.

But alongside of this, the service. feudal relation commonly implies the holding of land by military service. To grant land on such a tenure is in troth one form, one among several, of that bounty of the lord to his followers to which his very title of Hlaford is Military owing. The lord makes his follower a grant of land as suggested the reward of past services, and he makes the continuation by the rela- 0f those services the condition of his follower's keeping Comitatus, the land so granted. But there can be no doubt that the tendency to this particular form of bounty was greatly strengthened by the example of the Roman practice of and also by granting out frontier lands to be held by military service.2 the Roman tenures on The holders of such lands held them of the Roman Republic, tier \u00b0n ano- to the Roman Republic their service was due.

But the union in c 1 emeu ts united the same person of the Teutonic tie of the Comitatus and Feudalism. the Roman tie of land held by military service would produce a relation coming very near to the strictly feudal relation. The Roman custom would easily suggest to the Teutonic conquerors the practice of rewarding their fol lowers with grants of lands \u2014 in short with benefices or fiefs \u2014 as the most convenient and honourable form which the bounty of the lord could take. In Britain indeed, 1 \" Homo\"\u2014 whence \" homagium,\" \" hommage\"\u2014 is the constant technical name for the vassal.

Homage was there ; for the relation of every man to his lord was a relation of homage. Heriots too and other incidents of a feudal character already existed. But these feudal elements had not yet been wrought together into any harmonious feudal system. The Comitatus, the germ of feudalism, had thriven and developed and was now dominant ; but the old Teutonic constitution had not been utterly wiped out.

That lord military may be the King ; but if so, the service is still in strictness *n\u2122^: owing to him, not as head of the state, but as lord of the noda Ne fief. But there is another obligation to military service which is older than this. All land in England was, by the earliest Common Law, subject to three burthens, to contributions to the three works most necessary for the defence of the country. These were the famous Trinoda Necessitas, the obligation to service in the field (fyrd) and to a share in the repairs of fortresses and of bridges.1 1 This was found in a somewhat different form on the continent. See the documents in Waitz, Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte, iv. 266, one of Charles the Great, which speaks \" de tribus causis, de hoste publico, hoc est de banno nostro, quando publicitus promovetur, et wacta, vel pontes com ponendum.\" Waitz remarks, \" Statt der Wachtdienste wird bei den Angel-"], [138, "THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. 94 chap, in, Folkland and Book land. Conversion of Folk- land into Bookland in favour pf the But these are duties owed by the citizen to the com- monwealth, or by the subject to the sovereign, not duties owed by a personal vassal' to a personal lord. Land, in an age when there was little property except in land, is simply taken as the measure of the contribution due from each man to the common defence. From these burthens, as a rule, no land could be free ; even church-lands were regularly subject to them, though in some cases their owners contrived to obtain exemptions.1 These ancient obligations pressed alike on the ancient allodial possession and on the land held by any more modern tenure. They were not feudal services, but a tax paid to the state. They were in fact the price paid to the commonwealth for the protection which it gave ; or rather they were the share which each member of the commonwealth was bound to take in the protection of himself and his neighbours. I have already mentioned the folkland, the common land of the community or of the nation, out of which the ancient allodial possessions were carved. This process of turning public property into private went on largely in later times. The alienation was now commonly made by a document in writing, under the signatures of the King and his Witan ; land so granted was therefore said to be booked to the grantee, and was known as bookland. Portions of the folkland were thus cut off from the public ownership, and were booked to private individuals or cor porations. The greater number of the existing ancient charters consists of grants of this kind. A vast number are of course in favour of the Church, but those which are made to the King's faithful Thegns are hardly less common. In either case portions of the folkland are sachsen und spater auch aus deutschem Boden das sogenannte Burgwerk, die Hiilfe beim Burgenbau, genannt.\" And to the repair of bridges, some of his documents add that of churches and roads. 1 For continental exemptions under the Karlings, see Waitz, iv. 268."], [139, "FOLKLAND AND BOOKLAND. 95 alienated, booked, to private use with the consent of the chap. in.

The booking might of course be made on any Church terms; any sort of tenure might be created; but the great Kind's object of the grantee was to get the land on the same TheSns terms as an ancient e&el, subject only to the three burthens, which not even the most favoured Thegn, hardly the most favoured churchman, could hope to escape.1 The folkland, the common property of the state, was of Conversion course at the disposal of the state, and of the state only. iand into It was granted by the King, but only by the consent and BooHla\u00b0d o j o-* j j required authority of his Witan.

The King was only its chief administrator, enjoying its use, so far as he en joyed it, only as the head and representative of the nation. But the King, like any other man, had his private estate. Tbe King's private Like any other man, he might have his ancient allodial estate. property, or he might, like any other man, have land booked to him, land which followed the ordinary course of legal succession or testamentary disposal.2 It was indeed needful that the King should have such private pos sessions ; for, in our ancient elective monarchy, the reign ing King had no certainty that the crown, and the possessions attached to the crown, would ever pass to his descendants. But after the Norman Conquest, as Folkland the royal power increased, and as the modern notion of y^f^ hereditary right was gradually developed, these two Regis, kinds of possession got confounded. On the one hand, the nation was forgotten or merged in the person of its chief; the folkland was held to be the King's land, Terra 1 See Appendix P. 2 See Allen, pp. 143, 153, et seqq.; also on the whole subject of the change of Folkland into Terra Regis."], [140, "THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. 96 chap. hi. Eegis ; the King was led to look on the possessions of the nation as his own, and to grant them away at his own pleasure without the consent of Parliament. On the other hand, lawyers brought in the strange doctrine that the King could hold no private property, but that, on his accession to the crown, his private estate was merged in what was now held to be the royal domain. By one of those curious cycles which so often come round in human affairs, both these wrougs have been redressed, one formally, the other practically. Our modern Kings have recovered the ancient right, common to them with other men, of inheriting, purchasing, and bequeathing and be- private estates.

The free communities of Germany vanished ; but the German nation gained nothing, the German King gained nothing ; the liberties and rights alike of the King, of the nation, and of the local communities, were con fiscated to the profit of a brood of petty despots. The constitution which Tacitus saw and wondered at, the con stitution for which Arminius fought and conquered, the constitution whose working may still be seen year by year in the free air of Uri and Appenzell, gave way in the great Teutonic realm to the dominion of princes who re presented nothing but themselves, who embodied no national or provincial being, who were the mere creation of modern dynastic and diplomatic arrangements, \u2014 arrange ments which did their best to wipe out every historic name and every national memory, and to assign to each of their princely creatures an arbitrary extent of dominion traced out at haphazard upon the map.1 Such was the fate of the Teutonic mainland ; such wras not the fate of the Teutonic island. The uprooting of the old free com- munities, the growth of the power of the King and of his Thegns, no doubt tended in England, as elsewhere, to the degradation, at least for a while, of the lowest class of freemen.

The aggregation of of Shires, marks into shires is indeed mainly to be inferred from local nomenclature and from the analogy of other Teutonic countries; but the aggregation of shires into kingdoms is The Mark- matter of recorded history. It is even possible that the system pro- . ... bably less circumstances of the English Conquest of Britain may England1 have hindered the mark from ever possessing the same than else- amount of independence in England which it possessed where. L in the older Teutonic lands. When every English settle- ment had to defend itself, and if possible to extend itself, in the teeth of a hostile Welsh population, the different settlements must have kept up a very close union ; there must have been from the beginning, if not centralization, yet at any rate something like federation. The first fol lowers of Cerdic no doubt settled themselves in marks, forming self-governing communities; but all must have held themselves ready to march at Cerdic's bidding, whenever it was needful to repel an inroad of the Welsh, whenever things promised well for a fresh inroad upon them. Still such communities, the mark and the shire, however dependent externally on some central authority, were doubtless internally self-governed from the beginning. 1 On this whole subject I must again refer to Mr. Kemble, especially to his chapters on the Mark and the Shire. 2 Many of our present shires are historically divisions of kingdoms (see above, p. 48), and the word Scir, connected with seem or shear, of course actually means division. But the word is most likely a comparatively modern one ; the Shire or Pagus answers to the German Gau, on which see Kemble's chapter on the Gd, and the chapter in the first volume of Waitz, Beutsche Verfassungsgeschichte, \" Das Dors, die Gemeinde, der Gau.\""], [143, "GROWTH OP SHIRES AND KINGDOMS. 99 We have already seen 1 how shires, ruled each one by its own chap. hi.

Gradually the con nexion became closer, the process no doubt being quicker in Wessex than in Mercia or Northumberland. The head King became the only King, the only independent ex ecutive ; and the assembly of his Witan became the only independent legislature. In place of Kings, independent or dependent, the shires received Ealdormen, named by the King and his Witan, and liable to be removed by them.

Origin and Poivers of the Witenagemot. By these means those great kingdoms were formed which produced Bretwaldas and which strove for the supremacy of Britain. Each stage of union increased the kingly power; each stage lessened the independence of local communities and lessened the importance of their individual members. The democratic character of the old Teutonic system contained the seeds of its own destruction, whenever it should be applied to districts of any great extent. We may be sure that every Teutonic freeman had a voice in the assembly \u2014 the Gemot, the Gemeinde, the Ekklesia \u2014 of his own mark. In fact he in some sort keeps it still, as holding his place in the parish vestry. He had a voice ; it might be too much to say that he had a vote ; for in an early state of things formal divisions are not likely to be often taken ; the temper of the assembly is found out by easier means. But the man who clashed his arms to express approval, or who joined in the un mistakeable sound which expressed dissent,2 practically gave as efficient a vote as if he had solemnly walked out into a lobby.

By this process an originally democratic assembly, without any formal exclusion of any class of its members, gradually shrank up into an aristocratic assembly. I trust that I have shown in another work1 how, under closely analogous circumstances, the Federal Assembly of Achaia, legally open to every Achaian citizen, was commonly attended only by those who were both rich and zealous, and how it often happened that the members of the inner body, the Senate, themselves alone formed the assembly. In the same way, an assembly of all the free- men of Wessex, when those freemen could not attend personally and when they had no means of attending by representatives, gradually changed into an assembly at- tended by few or none but the King's Thegns. The great officers of Church and State, Ealdormen, Bishops, Abbots, would attend ; the ordinary Thegns would attend more laxly, but still in considerable numbers ; the King would preside ; a few leading men would discuss ; the general mass of the Thegns, whether they formally voted or not, would make their approval or disapproval practically felt ; no doubt the form still remained of at least announcino- the resolutions taken to any of the ordinary freemen whom curiosity had drawn to the spot ; most likely the form still remained of demanding their ceremonial assent, though 1 Hist, of Federal Government, i. 266. We may be sure however, both from the smaller extent of the country and from the political instincts of the Greek mind, that popular attendance never died out so completely in Achaia as it did in England. And in both cases those who lived in the neighbourhood of the place of meeting would doubtless often attend when people from a distance did not. The frequent attendance of the citizens of London in the Witenagemdt may be compared with the appearance of a vast crowd of Corinthian citizens of inferior rank in an assembly held at Corinth, which is spoken of as unusual.

A primary assembly, an Ekklesia, a Landesgemeinde, is an Primary excellent institution in a commonwealth so small as to suited only allow of its being really worked with effect. But in any to sma11 \u00b0 J common large community it either becomes a tumultuous mob, like wealths. the later Roman Comitia or the Florentine Parliament, or else it gradually shrinks up into an aristocratic body, as the old Teutonic assemblies did both in England and on the continent.

There is no doubt that, on some particular occasions, some classes at least of the people did actually take a part in the proceedings of the national council ; thus the citizens of London are more than once recorded to have taken a share in the election of Kings.1 No theory that I know of will explain all these ph\u00e6nomena except that which I have just tried to draw out. This is, that every freeman had an abstract right to be present, but that any actual share in the proceed ings of the assembly had, gradually and imperceptibly, come to be confined to the leading men, to the King's Thegns, strengthened, under peculiarly favourable circum stances, by the presence of exceptional classes of freemen, like the London citizens.2 It is therefore utterly vain for any political party to try to press the supposed con stitution of our ancient national councils into the service of modern political warfare.

It is not uncommon to hear people talk about the times before and shortly after the Norman Conquest as if the Act for the Settlement of the Royal Succession had already been in force in those days. It is strange to hear a number of princes, both before and since the Conquest, popularly spoken of as \" usurpers,\" merely because they came to the crown in a different way from that which modern law and custom prescribe. It is strange that people who talk in Popular . \u2022 \u2022 1 r misconcep this way commonly forget that their own principle, so lar ti0ns on as it proves anything, proves a great deal more than they^3\" intend.

It is stranger still to hear others talk as if hereditary succession, according to some particular theory of it, was a divine and eternal law which could not be departed from without sin. Those who talk in this way should at least tell us what the divine and unchangeable law of succession is; for in a purely historical view of things, nearly every kingdom seems to have a law of succession of its own. Our forefathers at any rate knew nothing of any such superstitions. The ancient English kingship was elective. It was elective in the same sense in which all the old Teutonic kingdoms were elective. Among a people in whose eyes birth was highly valued, it was deemed fitting that the King should be the descendant of illustrious and royal forefathers. In the days of heathen dom it was held that the King should come of the sup posed stock of the Gods. Thus in every kingdom there was a kingly house, out of which alone, under all ordinary circumstances, Kings were chosen ; but within that kingly house the Witan of the land had a free choice. The eldest son of the last King would doubtless always have a preference ; if he was himself at all worthy of the place, if his father's memory was at all cherished, he would com monly be preferred without hesitation, probably chosen without the appearance of any other candidate. But a preference was all to which he was entitled, and he seems not to have been entitled even to a preference unless he was actually the son of a crowned King.1 If he were too young, or otherwise disqualified, the electors passed him by and chose some worthier member of the royal family. CHAP. III. Kings com monly cho sen out of a particu lar family. The eldest son of the last King has a pre ference, but no more.

Eadward the Confessor was chosen in preference to the absent son of an elder brother. At the death of Eadgar, when the royal family contained only minors to choose from, the electors were divided between the elder and the younger brother. Minors who had been once passed by might or might not be elected at a later vacancy. \u00c6thelwold, the son of \u00c6thelred the First, who had been passed by in favour of his uncle \u00c6lfred, was again passed by on \u00c6lfred's death, because no claim could compare with that of Eadward, the worthy son of the most glorious of fathers. The children of Eadmund were passed by in favour of their uncle Eadred, but on Eadred's death the choice fell on the formerly excluded Eadwig. And as a A certain certain preference was acquired by birth, a certain pre- acqmred\u00b0e ference was acquired by the recommendation of the late the r e.~ A commenda- King. So Eadgar recommended his elder son Eadward tion of the to the electors ; so Eadward the Confessor recommended Harold. \u00c6thelwulf had long before attempted, by the help of a will confirmed by the Witan, to establish a peculiar law of succession, which soon broke down.1 But it is clear that a certain importance was attached to the wishes of a deceased and respected King, as conveying a distinct preference. But it conveyed nothing more than a preference; the person who enjoyed such preference, whether by birth or by nomination, could still be passed by without breach of constitutional right. From these principles it follows that, as any disqualified person in the kingly house might be passed by, so, if the whole house were disqualified, the whole house might be passed by.

That laws were ordained, and taxes imposed,1 by the. authority of the Witan, that they sat as the highest court for the trial of exalted and dangerous of fenders, is only what we should look for from the analogy of modern times. It is more important to find that the King and his Witan, and not the King alone, concluded treaties, made grants of folkland, ordained the assemblage of fleets and armies, appointed and deposed the great officers of Church and State. Of the exercise of all these powers 1 Taxation, in our modern sense, is seldom a matter of great importance in an early state of society. Public or demesne lands, various imposts on lands, feudal dues and compositions of various kinds, largely supply its place. Taxation in the modern sense is scarcely heard of in our earliest history, except for one shameful and unhappy purpose, that of buying off the Danish invaders. For this purpose a real tax, the famous Danegeld, was levied, and levied, as appears by several passages of the Chronicles, by the joint authority of the King and his Witan. So, during the same unhappy reign of \u00c6thelred, we shall find the King and his Witan laying on an impost, of which I shall speak more when I come to it in the course of my narrative, one of a kind intermediate between ship-money and an Athenian Ketrovpyia."], [155, "UNIVERSAL POWERS OF THE WITAN. 111 by the assembled Witan we shall find abundant examples chap. hi. in the course of this history.

And, in our present state of things, little or no harm, and some direct good, comes from Parliament preferring an indirect course of action on these subjects. But in an earlier state of things, a Direct more direct agency of the Parliament or other national necessary assembly is absolutely necessary. The assembly has to I? y deal, not with a ministry whom it can create and destroy without any formal action, but with a personal King, whom it has indeed elected and whom it can depose, but whose election and deposition are solemn national acts, his deposition indeed being the rarest and most extreme of all national acts. In such a state of things the power of the King may be strictly limited by law ; but, within the limits which the law prescribes to him, he acts according to his own will and pleasure, or according to the advice of counsellors who are purely of his own choosing. In such a state of things the King and the nation are brought face to face, and it is needful that the national assembly should have a much more direct control over affairs than is at all needful when the ingenious device of a responsible ministry is interposed between King and Parliament. Long after the days of our ancient Witenagemots, in the days of Edward the Third for instance, Parliament was consulted about wars and negotiations in a much more direct way than it is now.

CHAP. III. Joint action of the King and the Witan. direct way than it was then. Our present system avoids, above all things, all possibility of direct personal collision between Parliament and the sovereign. But such direct personal collisions form the staple of English history from the thirteenth century onwards. In earlier times we seldom come across any record of the debates of our national councils, though we often know their determinations. How far such collisions commonly took place in early times1 we have but small means of knowing. They were per haps less to be looked for in the tenth or eleventh century than in the thirteenth or fourteenth. In the later times the King had to deal with his Parliament as with some thing external to himself, something which laid petitions before him which he could accept or reject at pleasure. A struggle in those days was a struggle between the King and an united Parliament. Nowadays, as we all know, the struggle takes place within the walls of Parliament itself. But we can well believe that, in this respect as in so many others, the earliest times were really more like our own than the intermediate centuries were. An ancient Witena gemot did not petition ; it decreed ; it confirmed the acts of the King which, without the assent of the Witan, had no validity; it was not a body external to the King, but a body of which the King was the head in a much more direct sense than he could be said to be the head of a later medi\u00e6val Parliament. The King aud his Witan acted together; the King could do nothing without the Witan, and the Witan could do nothing without the King ; they were no external, half-hostile, body ; they 1 There was a direct collision in the case of that \" Good Parliament\" of the eleventh century, the famous Mycel Gembt which restored Godwine and his family and drove out the foreign favourites of Eadward. But whether anybody voted against the enactment of the Laws of \u00c6thelstan or Eadgar we have no means of knowing.

Direct collisions between the King on the one hand and an united Gemot on the other were not likely to be common. And as to the great powers of the Witenagemot, as to its direct participation in all important acts of government, there can be no doubt. They are legibly written in every page of our early history. The vast Diminu increase of the power of the crown after the Norman parlia- Conquest, the gradual growth of a systematic feudal juris- prudence, did much to lessen the authority and dignity of the Con the national councils. The idea of a nation and its chief, of a King and his counsellors, almost died away; the King became half despot, half mere feudal lord. England was never without national assemblies of some kind or other ; but from the Conquest in the eleventh century till the second birth of freedom in the thirteenth, our national assemblies do not stand out in the same distinct and living shape in which they stand out both in earlier and in later times. Here ag-ain we owe our thanks to The old f 1 those illustrious worthies, from the authors of the Great won y,^ Charter onwards, who, in so many ways, won back for us JJ^ our ancient constitution in another shape. I have said century. that no political party can draw any support for its own peculiar theories from that obscurest of subjects, the con stitution of the Witenagemot. But no lover of our old historic freedom can see without delight how venerable a thing that freedom is, how vast and how ancient are the rights and powers of an English Parliament. Our ancient Gemots enjoyed every power of a modern Parliament, together with some powers which modern Parliaments shrink from claiming. Even such a matter of detail as the special security granted to the persons of members of the two Houses has been traced, and not without a show of probability, to an enactment which stands at the very front of English secular jurisprudence, VOL. i. i"], [158, "114 THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. chap. hi. the second among the laws ordained by our first Christian King and the Witan of his kingdom of Kent.1 The King As the powers of the Witan were thus extensive, as pet inPthe\" the King could do no important act of government with hands of out their consent, some may hastily leap to the conclusion trip WitctTi that an ancient English King was a mere puppet in the hands of the national council. No inference could be more mistaken. Nothing is clearer in our early history than the personal agency of the King in everything that is done, and the unspeakable difference between a good and Vast im- a bad King. The truth is that in an early state of of^he06 society almost everything depends on the personal cha- personal racter of the King.

The unhappy reign of \u00c6thelred showed the bad side of even that limited application of the hereditary principle which was all that they admitted. Under her great Kings England had risen from her 1 Laws of \u00c6thelberht, Thorpe, i. 2. \"Gif cyning his leode to him gehated, and heom mon p\u00e6r yfel gedo, II bote and cyninge L scillinga.\""], [159, "IMPORTANCE OF THE KING'S PERSONAL CHARACTER. 115 momentary overthrow to an Imperial dominion.

The accession of the minor son of Eadgar, a child who, except in his crimes and vices, never got beyond childhood, dragged down the glorious fabric into the dust. So greatly did national welfare and national misfortune de pend on the personal character of the King. The King, it is true, could do nothing without his Witan ; but as his Witan could do nothing without him, he was not a shadow or a puppet, but a most important personal agent. He was no more a puppet than the Leader of the House of Commons is a puppet.

But when the King had 1 See Historical Essays, Second Series, p. 32. 2 On \u00c6lfred's deference to the authority of his Witan, see the quotation from his Laws, above, p. 52.

The Witan decreed, but it was the King who carried out their decrees. Weighty as was the influence of his personal character on the nature of the resolutions to be passed, its influence was weightier still on the way in which those resolutions were to be carried out. Under a good King counsel and execution went hand in hand ; under a weak or wicked King there was no place found for either. Sometimes disgraceful resolu tions were passed ; sometimes wise and good resolutions were never carried into effect. The Witan under \u00c6thelred sometimes voted money to buy off the Danes, sometimes they voted armies to fight against them ; but, with \u00c6thel red to carry out their votes, it mattered little what their Influence votes were.

He was the Cyne-hlaford, at once the King of the nation and the personal lord of each individual. Though his grants of folkland and his nominations to the highest offices needed the assent of the Witan, yet in these matters above all his initiative would be undoubted ; the Witan had only to confirm, and they would seldom be tempted to reject, the proposals which the King laid before them. He was not less the fountain of honour and the fountain of wealth, because in the disposal of both he had certain decent ceremonies to g-o through.

Altogether, narrowly limited as were the legal powers of an ancient English King, his will, or lack of will, had the main influence on the destinies of the nation, and his personal character was of as much moment to the welfare of the state as the personal character of an absolute ruler. \u00a7 4. The Imperial poioer of the King and his relation to the Dependent Kingdoms. The King and his Witan then, in their joint action, formed the supreme legislature and the supreme tribunal of the English kingdom.

The ancient divisions were indeed by no means forgotten ; above all, the great Danish land beyond the Humber still retained a lively memory of its former inde pendence. Both Northumberland and the other incorpo rated kingdoms kept much of the form of distinct states ; each state had its local Witenagemot, presided over by its local Ealdorman or Earl, who exercised, by commission from the King and his Witan, full royal authority within his own province. But I have already explained that, vast as were the powers of an ancient Ealdorman, he was still only a great magistrate, not a prince, even a dependent prince. The whole land formed one kingdom under one King, and the King and his Witan held direct authority"], [162, "THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. 118 chap. m. in every corner of it. But this kingdom of the English was not the only title and dignity to which the house of Superiority Cerdic had attained. The King of the English was also of the3^6 Emperor of the whole isle of Britain. I must now explain slxon somewhat more at length the nature of this British Empire, Kings over as distinguished from the English kingdom which was all Britain. _,.. . \u25a0 i \u25a0 x iii- Statement only Part of xt- In this inquiry two special points call tor of the notice.

There is, secondly, the question as to the force of ' r ' . . tlieassump- the exact nature of that superiority, and as to the motives strictly which led the Kings of the tenth and eleventh centuries to Imperial assume distinctively Imperial titles. It must not be for- gotten that in those days such titles were not assumed at random ; the idea of the Roman Empire was still thoroughly understood, and indeed the Roman Empire itself, both in the East and in the West, was in one of its most flourish- ing periods. The fact that the West-Saxon or English Kings, from Eadward the Elder onwards, did exercise an external supre macy over the Celtic princes of the island is a fact too clear to be misunderstood by any one who looks the evidence on Superiority the matter fairly in the face. I date their supremacy over OVGr Scot land dates Scotland from the reign of Eadward the Elder, because j? , there is no certain earlier instance of submission on the the Elder, part of the Scots to any West-Saxon King. I pass by the No earlier instances of Scottish submission to the earlier Northumbrian supremacy Kings, as well as the seeming submission of both Scots and in Wessex. Northumbrians to the Roman Empire itself in the person of Charles the Great.1 These instances do not prove the existence of any permanent superiority; they are rather analogous to the temporary and fluctuating superiority of 1 See Appendix D."], [163, "COMMENDATION OF SCOTLAND. 119 this or that Bretwalda over the other English kingdoms, chap, nx But from the time of Eadward the Elder onwards the case is perfectly clear.

In both cases the commendation was a solemn national act. I use the feudal word commendation, Nature of because that word seems to me better than any other to datim . express the real state of the case. The transaction between Eadward and the Celtic princes was simply an application, on an international scale, of the general principle of the Comitatus. That relation, like all the feudal relations the relation ...... unaffected which it helped to form, may be entered into either on by great the greatest or on the smallest scale. The land which \"^aiiness is originally granted out on a feudal tenure, or which its of scale allodial owner finds it expedient to convert into a fief held on feudal tenure, may be a kingdom or it may be a rood of land maintaining its man. So the lord whom a man chooses, and the man who chooses the lord, may be of any possible rank, from the Emperor and the Pope with their vassal Kings down to the smallest Thegn and his neigh bourino- ceorl. It would even seem that the ceorl himself might be the lord of a poorer ceorl.2 The relation is 1 See Appendix G. 2 A ceorl might have his own loaf-eaters (Hlaf-\u0153tas.

In every case alike, great or small, faithful service is owing on the one side and faithful protection on the other. In every case alike, great or small, the relation may imply a strictly feudal tenure of land or it may not.

And the process was equally familiar among of Com- . . mendation sovereign princes themselves. Almost all the northern sovereign an<^ eastern vassals of the Western Empire, some of them princes. 0f kingly rank,2 became vassals by commendation. The commendation was doubtless in many cases far from volun tary, but the legal form was always the same.

Not to speak of a crowd of smaller instances, Odo, King Homage of of the West- Franks, commended himself to Arnulf ofWest_ Germany, just as Howel and Constantine commended themselves to Eadward of Wessex. And this commen- 888. dation was made before Arnulf became Emperor and Lord of the World, while he was still the simple King of the Eastern Franks.1 The commendation of Scotland and Strathclyde was, in form at least, a perfectly voluntary act, done with the full consent of the nations interested.

That this point, the only point which could with any justice have been brought forward against Edward on the Scottish side, never was brought forward shows how completely the ancient notion of commendation had gone out of mind.2 But the principal point at issue, the right of the over-lord to decide between two claimants of the vassal kingdom, rested on excellent precedents in the reigns of Eadward the Confessor and of William Rufus. Altogether the vassalage \u2014 to use the most convenient word \u2014 of Scotland from the 924-1328. commendation to Eadward to the treaty of Northampton Threefold is one of the best authenticated facts in history.

In the eleventh century chap. hi. at least, if not in the tenth, the King of Scots stood to his English over-lord in a threefold relation, grounded on three distinct acts which are popularly confounded. In this matter, as in so many others, prevalent ignorance is strengthened by inattention to historical geography. As it is hard to make people understand that there has not always been a kingdom of France including Marseilles and Strassburg, perhaps even including Nizza and Chambery, so it is hard to make people understand that there were not always kingdoms of England and Scotland, with the Tweed and the Cheviot Hills as the boundaries between them. It must be borne in mind that in the tenth century no such boundaries were known, and that the very names of England and Scotland were only just beginning to be heard. At the time of the commendation the country Geography which is now called Scotland was divided among three iantj quite distinct sovereignties.

South of the two great firths the Scottish name and the Scottish dominion were unknown.

In the year 924 Lothian, like the rest of Northumberland, was subject only to that precarious supe- riority on the part of Wessex which had been handed on from Ecgberht and \u00c6lfred. In the year 924, when the"], [168, "124 THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. CHAP. Ill, Since 908, Popular confusions true na- ture of the grant of Cumber land. three kingdoms, Scotland, Strathclyde, and Northumber land, all commended themselves to Eadward, the relation was something new on the part of Scotland and Strathclyde; but on the part of Lothian, as an integral part of Northum berland, it was only a renewal of the relation which had been formerly entered into with Ecgberht and \u00c6lfred. It is not uncommon to hear the vassalage of Scotland proper, that is, the land north of the Forth and Clyde, mixed up with questions about Cumberland and Lothian. But, at the time of the Commendation of 924, Lothian stood in no relation at all towards Scotland, except that of simple, most likely not very friendly, neighbourhood. Strathclyde was already ruled by princes of the Scottish royal house,1 but it was still a kingdom quite independent of Scotland. The transactions which brought Scotland, Strathclyde, and Lothian into their relations to one another and to the English crown were quite distinct from each other. They were as follows : \u2014 First, The Commendation of the King and people of the Scots to Eadward in 924. Secondly, The Grant of Cumberland by Eadmund to Malcolm in 945. Thirdly, The grant of Lothian to the Scottish Kings, either under Eadgar or under Cnut. These three events are perfectly distinct, and the relations created by them are perfectly distinct ; but, as always hap pens when several relations and tenures co-exist, the three gradually got confounded together, both in idea and in fact. Both in popular conception and in the hands of partizan Scottish writers, the second of these three events is made to obscure the other two. The grant by an English King to a Scottish King of a country described as Cumberland is something too clear to be denied ; that the Scottish princes held their Cumbrian dominions as a fief of the 1 See Robertson, Scotland under her Early Kings, i. 55."], [169, "CUMBERLAND A REAL FIEF. 125 English crown, that they did homage for them to the chap. hi. English King, no Scottish writer has ever ventured to call in doubt.1 In truth there seems never to have been any wish to call this fact in doubt, because the Cumbrian homage, put forth sometimes even in an exaggerated shape, has formed a convenient means of escape from the fact of the homage for Scotland proper and from the fact of the purely English character of Lothian. And the confusion of geographical terms comes conveniently in. In modern language Cumberland means a single shire which for ages has been undoubtedly English. In modern language Lothian means three shires which for ages have been un doubtedly Scottish. People are thus led to believe that Lothian was from all time an integral part of Scotland, and also that the homage done by the Scottish to the English King was done only for the county of Cumberland as an integral part of England. But in the language of the year 945 Lothian was still an integral portion of England; Cum berland meant a country, part of which is now English and part Scottish, but which up to that time was neither English nor Scottish, but the seat of a distinct Welsh principality. By Cumberland in short is meant, not merely the modern English county so called, but all northern Strathclyde; that is, modern Cumberland toge ther with a considerable portion of modern Scotland. In Circum 945 the reigning King Donald revolted against his over- the grant lord Eadmund ; he was overthrown and his kingdom {^juJ\u00a3ber' ravaged ; 2 it was then granted on tenure of military Strath- clyde. service to Donald's kinsman Malcolm King of Scots. Malcolm could hardly have earned this favour except by sharing in the war against Donald, which indeed his actual relation to the English crown bound him to do. For a long time the fief then granted was granted out again by the Scottish Kings as an apanage for their own 1 See Appendix H. 2 Ibid."], [170, "THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. 126 heirs-apparent. The southern part of this territory was afterwards, as we shall see at a later stage of our history, annexed to England ; the northern part was kept by the Scottish Kings, and was gradually, though very gradu ally, incorporated with their own kingdom. The dis tinction between the two states seems to have been quite forgotten in the thirteenth century; neither side in the controversies of that time drew any distinction between the tenure of Fife and the tenure of Galloway; the claims of the English crown were asserted, admitted, or denied, equally with regard to both. Yet the relations between England and Scotland proper and the relations between England and Strathclyde or Cumberland, though much the same in their nature, were wholly different in their origin. The relation in which Scotland stood to England was one of commendation ; the relation in which Cumber land stood to England was one of original grant. This last fact marks a distinct advance in feudal ideas. Cum berland was from the beginning a real territorial fief. Eadward did not grant Scotland to Constantine, because Scotland had never been his ; but Constantine and his people, by their own act, put themselves in the same position as if it had been so granted. But Eadmund really did grant Cumberland to Malcolm ; he granted him a territory which he had himself conquered, and which he might have kept in his own hands. Cumberland in short \u2014 including, as must not be forgotten, the south-western shires of modern Scotland \u2014 was held by the Scottish King or his son as a feudal benefice in the strictest sense.

Grant of Lothian. Cumberland then was truly a fief of the crown of Eng land, but it was not a fief held within the king-dom of England. This last position, popularly thought to be the position of Cumberland, was really the position of Lothian. The date of the grant of Lothian is not perfectly"], [171, "GRANT OF LOTHIAN. 127 clear.1 But whatever was the date of the grant, there can chap. hi. be no doubt at all as to its nature. Lothian, an integral Lothian part of England, could be granted only as any other part pariTof81* of England could be granted, namely to be held as part EnSlaild of England, its ruler being in the position of an English Earl. If the grant was really made by Eadgar, this is still more likely to be the case, on account of the unusual friendliness of the relations between Eadgar and Kenneth. Eadgar might well grant, and Kenneth might well accept, a purely English government, held by a tenure which would bind him still more closely to his English over lord than either his commendatory relation for Scotland or his feudal relation for Strathclyde. But in such a Lothian grant the seeds of separation were sown.

The King of Scots, though holding all his dominions by various kinds of dependent tenure, could not be dealt with in any portion of them like a simple Earl of the North humbrians. That the possession of Lothian would under all ordinary circumstances remain hereditary, must have been looked for from the beginning. This alone would distinguish Lothian from all other earldoms. Though it was very common to appoint the son of a deceased Eal dorman to his father's dignity, still he had not so much as a preferential claim ; the office was held altogether at the pleasure of the King and his Witan. But when a province was once granted to a foreign prince, even though that prince remained a feudatory of the English crown, this kind of control was parted with for ever, or could be won back only at the cost of war. Lothian could not Distinction fail to become an hereditary dominion of the Scottish Scotland, Kings ; it could not fail gradually to lose its distinct |tr^hand 1 See Appendix I."], [172, "THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. 128 CHAP. III. Lothian gradually forgotten. Later his tory of Lothian Lothian be comes the historical Scotland. character and the remembrance of its distinct tenure, and to be gradually merged in the mass of the other dominions of its rulers. By the time of the great controversy of the thirteenth century the distinction seems to have been forgotten on both sides, exactly as it was in the case of Strathclyde. The claims of the English King were the same over the whole country, over Scotland, Strathclyde, and Lothian ; they were put forward as a whole, and they were accepted or rejected as a whole. Yet, when we weigh the claims of Edward the First by the letter of the compacts of the tenth century, if we pronounce them to go a little beyond the mark in the case of Scotland proper, we must equally pronounce them to fall a little under the mark in the case of Lothian. The fact is that the progress of feudal ideas had wiped out the distinction, and had brought all tenures to the same level. The alter- native by that time had come to be whether Scotland, as a whole, that is, Scotland proper, Scottish Strathclyde, and Lothian, should be a fief of England or an independent kingdom. That Scotland, Strathclyde, and Lothian were originally all dependencies of England, but held in three different degrees of dependence, had passed out of mind on both sides. It was then to be expected that Lothian, when once granted to the King of Scots, should gradually be merged in the kingdom of Scotland. But the peculiar and singular destiny of this country could hardly have been looked for. Neither Eadgar nor Kenneth could dream that this purely English province would become the historical Scotland. The different tenures of Scotland and Lothian got con founded ; the Kings of Scots, from the end of the eleventh century, became English in manners and language; they were not without some claims to the crown of England, and not without some hopes of winning it. They thus learned to attach more and more value to the English"], [173, "FORMATION OF MODERN SCOTLAND. 129 part of their dominions, and they laboured to spread its chap. hi. language and manners over their original Celtic territory. They kept their ancient title of Kings of Scots, but they became in truth King-s of English Lothian and of Angli cized Fife. A state was thus formed, politically distinct from England aud which political circumstances gradually made bitterly hostile to England \u2014 a state which indeed kept on a dark and mysterious Celtic background, but which, as it appears in history, is English in laws, lan guage, and manners, more truly English indeed, in many respects, than England itself remained after the Norman Conquest. As in so many other cases, the people took the name of their sovereign ; the English subjects of the King of Scots learned to call themselves Scots and their country Scotland. Meanwhile the true Scots to the north of them, the original subjects of the Scottish dynasty, forsaken as it were by their natural princes, became the standing difficulty of their government. The true Scots are known in history only as a mass of turbulent tribes, alien in customs, language, and feeling from those who had taken their name \u2014 tribes which the Kings of Dun fermline and Edinburgh had much ado to keep in even nominal subjection \u2014 tribes which, by a strange turning about of relations, were ready to fight for their English over-lord against the Kings of Dunfermline and Edin burgh.

In the case of Switzerland, parts of the German, Burgundian, and Italian nations were, through a variety of political causes, detached from the main body of their respective countrymen, and became united by a close political tie to one another. They thus vol. I. K"], [174, "130 THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. CHAP. hi. Their posi tion as artificial nations. Case of Wales analogous to that of Scotland. formed an artificial nation,1 a political and historical nation, but not a nation of common blood and speech. In the case of Scotland, portions of the English, Welsh, and Irish2 nations were in like manner detached from the main body of their own people ; they became in like manner politically connected with one another, and grew in like manner into an artificial nation. In both cases it is often amusing to hear men claim as their forefathers those who were the bitterest enemies of their real fore fathers. But in both cases it is more important to mark, what the history both of Switzerland and of Scotland abundantly proves, that an artificial nation of this kind is capable of as true and honourable national feeling as any nation of the most unmixed blood and language. The history both of Switzerland and of Scotland presents so many materials for honest pride that it is a pity that exaggerations and perversions of history should have ever been allowed to step in in either case. And, to cite one point more of likeness, each people has drawn its national name from a very small portion of its territory and popu lation. Switzerland, German, Burgundian, and Italian, has taken its common name from the single small canton of Schwyz. Scotland, English, Welsh, and Gaelic, has taken its common name from the original small colony of Irish Scots who settled on the coast of Argyll shire. I have dwelt on the Scottish question at length, both because of its intrinsic importance, and because the re lations between the crowns of England and Scotland will eall for constant notice in the course of our history. The case with regard to Wales is the case of Scotland over 1 See History of Federal Government, i. 120. 2 Again I keep clear of all mazes about Picts and Scots.

The homage of the Welsh Kings was always due, chap. hi. and was constantly exacted, from the days of Ecgberht and Eadward onwards. The only difference was in the final result. Wales was incorporated with the English i283 kingdom at the close of the thirteenth century, Scotland 1328. obtained perfect independence in the fourteenth. The life of one man made all the difference. The great Edward lived thoroughly to secure his Welsh conquest ; before he had thoroughly secured his Scottish conquest, his mission had passed to a son who could not keep his crown on his head at home. Before we leave this subject, it may be well to remember what the relations between a dependent kingdom and its superior lord really were. The King of the English did not, by virtue of the commendation, claim any juris diction within the dominions of his vassals. The in dividual inhabitant of Scotland stood in no relation to the English King.1 The relation was a purely inter- The rela national one. The King and people of the Scots chose tween Scot the King of the English as their Father and Lord; it1^^ became his duty to protect them against their enemies, intema- i-i 1 \u2022 1 - \u2022 \u25a0 tional only. and it became their duty to serve him against his enemies. But with the internal management of the Scottish king- dom he had no concern, nor did this or that individual Scot become his man or his subject. Such was the The rela relation ; as we go on, we shall see its engagements broken broken on on both sides. We shall find the Scottish vassal more hoih sides than once breaking through his duty of fidelity, and we shall once at least find the English over-lord of iooo. Strathclyde breaking through his duty of protection, setting up an unjust claim to a tribute which was not imposed by the original grant, and cruelly harry ing the land in revenge for a perfectly justifiable refusal 1 See Appendix G. K 2"], [176, "132 THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. chap. hi. of his demands.1 But such breaches of duty on both sides are in no way peculiar to England and Scotland ; they form a very large portion of the history of any two Delicate countries between which such relations existed. The truth theTela- ls that *ne feudal or commendatory relation is a very tion. delicate relation, one which offers constant temptations to a breach of its duties on both sides, temptations which, Analogy in a rude age, must often have been irresistible. The nial rela- relation is not identical with the modern relation between the mother country and its colonies and dependencies, but there are many points of analogy between the two. And we all know well how very delicate the relation always is between the metropolis and its colony. But the point to be borne in mind is that the English over lord of Scotland, Strathclyde, and Wales claimed no sovereignty within those countries, but only a superiority over them. He claimed such a superiority as the King of the French exercised, or claimed to exercise, over the Duke of the Normans. The relation was less close than the relation between the Emperor and the German princes, as no common Diet looked after the common interests of Attend- all. That the Scottish and Welsh princes had the right, Welsh and6 wnich they most likely deemed a burthen, of attending Scottish the meetings of the English Witan is certain : it is equally princes in . theWitena- certain that the attendance of the Scottish and Cumbrian princes was exceedingly rare.2 And at any rate they must have come only in their personal capacity, to transact any business which they might have with their over-lord and his counsellors. We cannot suppose that the English Gemot was ever attended by any Scottish or Welsh Witan beyond the immediate suite of the Scottish and Welsh Kings. The Kings came, because they were the men 1 I refer to the transactions between \u00c6thelred and Malcolm of Cum berland, which I shall speak of in my fifth Chapter. 2 See Appendix Q."], [177, "POSITION OF DEPENDENT KINGDOMS. 133 of the English over-lord ; but the private Scot or Briton chap. hi. was not the man of the English over-lord, and had no need to attend the assembly which he summoned. As little can we deem that the English Gemot took on itself to make laws for Wales or Scotland. Neither can we deem that the Welsh and Scottish princes, though they sign the acts of the Gemots at which they were present, took any active share or interest in purely English affairs. The King of the English was thus over-lord or ex ternal superior of all the princes of the isle of Britain. In that character, our Kings, from the days of \u00c6thelstan Statement onwards, bore titles beyond those of ordinary royalty, as to titles which in strictness belonged only to the successors Tnjper'al of Charles and of Constantine.

But I do not believe that there was the least thought of any succession from the ancient provincial Emperors, or from any phantom of Imperial sovereignty which may have lingered on among the Welsh at the time of the English Conquest or afterwards. I believe that these titles were taken in order to claim for the English crown an absolute independence of the Roman Empire, and at the same time to assert its right to a superiority over all the princes of Britain of the same kind as that which the Emperor exercised, or claimed to exercise, over all the princes of the mainland. I believe in short that, as the Metropolitan of England was sometimes spoken of as Pope of another world,1 so the King of the English claimed to be Emperor of the same island world, a world over which the Lord of the greater world at Rome or at Con stantinople had no authority. I will now go on to give the reasons for the conclusions to which I have come. Turgid It is undoubtedly true that the Latin charters of our the Latin Kings during the latter half of the tenth century are 1 See Appendix B."], [179, "USE OF IMPERIAL TITLES. 135 the most turgid and absurd of all human compositions, chap. in. Nothing is said straightforwardly; no idea is expressed Charters of tne tenth by the word which would most naturally occur to express century. it. The Latin language is ransacked for strange and out- of-the-way terms ; and when Latin fails, the writers draw on whatever store of Greek they enjoyed. They turn the whole into a piebald or mongrel language, something like the jargon of English lawyers in the seventeenth century.1 When such a taste prevailed, it was no wonder that the names of King, Ealdorman, and Bishop were thought not grand enough, and that the dignitaries of Church and Prevalent State were described by strange, foreign, and often quite Greek and unintelligible titles, Roman, Greek, Persian, anything otner that came uppermost. Again, it is no less true that titles. this sort of affectation is almost wholly confined to the PjV* J tation Latin charters. Those which are drawn up in English hardly are for the most part simple and business-like, and in the English them the use of Imperial titles is much rarer.2 Still I lar ers' cannot look on such titles as Basileus, Imperator, Imperator perial titles Augustus, as mere outbursts of swelling rhetoric. We must v \u2122j\u00b0\u00b0n\" remember that they were all formal titles, titles to which distinct J _ . meaning, a very distinct meaning was attached, titles which ex- and were pressed a special position and which carried with them a to be talfen special reverence, titles which were not then, as they are at now, taken up at random by every upstart who, half in shame, half in self-conceit, shrinks from calling himself by the straightforward title of King. Any one who knows what the medi\u00e6val theory of the Empire was will understand that for a man to call himself Imperator Au gustus was in those days no light matter. It was a thing which the vainest potentate would hardly do without some kind of reason for it. For an ordinary King to call himself Emperor was very nearly as strong a 1 For a specimen of this style see Macaulay, Hist, of Eng. i. 358. 2 See Appendix B."], [180, "THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. 136 measure as it would have been for an ordinary Archbishop to call himself Pope. Basileus again, the favourite title of all, was one specially Imperial ; by a caprice of lan guage it had become the Greek equivalent of Imperator ; it was the special title of the Eastern Emperors, the as sumption of which by any other prince was held by them to be an infringement of their sole claim to represent the old Roman sovereignty. It is hard to believe that our Kings would have assumed a title surrounded by such associations, one which had been made the subject of many disputes, merely to make a sentence in a charter sound more swelling. It is hard to believe that they would have assumed it without a direct intention to claim thereby a distinctly Imperial sovereignty. Still, consider ing the fondness for Greek titles and Greek words of all kinds which the charters so constantly display, if the title of Basileus stood alone, it might not be safe to lay too much stress upon it. But when we also meet with C\u00e6sar, Imperator, and Augustus, it is impossible to believe that any title of the class was assumed without a meaning. Whatever we say of the Greek title of Basileus, these Latin titles at least were not vague descriptions borrowed from a strange and half unintelligible language. They were titles in familiar use, titles which every one understood, titles which the diplomacy of the age studiously applied to one potentate and to one potentate only. They were titles whose force and use must have been perfectly well known to every man who understood the Latin language. It is utterly inconceivable that such titles should have been taken up at random. They could have had no object but to claim for the prince who assumed them a sovereignty of the same kind as that which belonged to the prince for whom they were commonly reserved. CHAP. Ill Force of the word Basileus. Still more distinct import of the other titles. The titles meant to assert an Imperial position. Granting then that the assumption of the Imperial titles had a meaning, and that it was not a mere piece"], [181, "FORCE OF THE TITLE OF BASILEUS. 137 of rhetorical vanity, the second question follows ; \u2014 Was chap. hi. there any real continuous Imperial tradition handed on from the days of the provincial Emperors, or were the Imperial titles simply assumed in imitation or rivalry or whatever it is to be called, of the contemporary German, Italian, and Byzantine Emperors ? My own conviction is very decidedly on the latter side.1 I do not see how any No con continuous Imperial tradition could have been handed on tradition from a Roman ruler in Britain to a West-Saxon King. ronV ;e , Every circumstance of the English Conquest shuts out Emperors. such a belief. It is likely enough that in Wales and Cornwall memories might still linger on from the days when C\u00e6sars and Augusti reigned in Britain. It is likely enough that Aurelius or Arthur or any other Welsh leader may have put forward some kind of Imperial pretensions. But that these princes should have handed on such rights or claims to their English conquerors and destroyers seems to me utterly inconceivable. We have seen in the last Chapter how completely the English Conquest of Britain differed from all other Teutonic conquests. Elsewhere the conquerors became more or less Romanized; they rejoiced to receive from the reigning Emperor the investiture of some Roman dignity, some empty title of Consul or Patrician. From the assumption of the Imperial dignity itself our whole race shrank with a kind of superstitious awe till the spell was broken by the coronation of the great Charles. This last motive indeed was one which could have no effect upon the mind of \u00c6lle or Ceawlin ; but its place would be fully supplied by utter ignorance, care lessness, and contempt for the titles and institutions of the vanquished. Consul, Patrician, Augustus, all would be alike unintelligible and despicable in their eyes. And, Real posi- .. , -n , , -n tion of the before we rule that an English Bretwalda or an Emperor ..

Perors-"], [182, "THE ANCIENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTION. 138 Tyrants ] or provincial Emperors, let us remember what the position of these Tyrants or Emperors really was. Carau sius, Maximus, Constantine, and the rest, never called themselves Emperors of Britain. According to the strict Imperial theory, an Emperor of Britain is an absurd impossibility; the titles assumed by Eadgar are in them selves as ridiculous as the titles assumed by those who in later times have called themselves \" Emperor of Austria,\" \" Emperor of Hayti,\" \" Emperor of Mexico,\" \" Emperor of the French.\" The Emperor is essentially Lord of Rome and of the World; and it was only by setting itself up as being in some sort another world that Britain could lay any claim to either a Pope or an Emperor of its own. But the very last thought of the old Tyrants or provincial Emperors would have been to claim any independent existence for Britain, Gaul, or any other part of the Empire of which they might have gained possession. Nothing could be further from their wishes than to set up anything like a separate national kingdom. They were pretenders to the whole Empire, if they could get it, and they not uncommonly did get it in the end. A man who began as tyrant often became a lawful Emperor, either by deposing the reigning Emperor or by being accepted by him as his colleague.

Carausius. 286-294. 1 The word Tyrant in those times bore a sense which may be called a monarchical antitype of its old Greek sense. The Greek tyrant was a man who obtained kingly power in a commonwealth ; the tyrants of the third and fourth centuries were men who revolted against a lawful Emperor. \" Licet apud nos incubator imperii tyrannus dicatur,\" says Servius (ad Virg. \u00c6n. vii. 266). In both cases, the word in strictness expresses only the origin of power, and not the mode of its exercise. Many of the so-called tyrants were excellent rulers. But the Imperial tyrant had this great advantage over the Greek tyrant, that success might turn him into a lawful Emperor, while the Greek tyrant remained a tyrant always. In medi\u00e6val writers the word is constantly used in this later Imperial sense, as equivalent to \"usurper\" or \"pretender.\""], [183, "NO SUCCESSION FROM THE PROVINCIAL EMPERORS. 139 that part of Gaul had been annexed to the dominions of a chap. m. national sovereign of Britain, as Calais was .by Edward the Third and Boulogne by Henry Eighth.

The essence of the position of an English Bretwalda or Basileus is that he is the very embodiment of an inde- pendent national existence, that he aspires to a dominion purely insular, that he claims supremacy over everything within the island, but aspires to no conquests beyond it. He is a \" Wielder of Britain,\" Emperor so far as he is independent of either continental Empire, Emperor so far as he exercises Imperial power over vassal princes within his own island. I can see no likeness between him and a Roman general, who aspires to reign on the seven hills, but who is unluckily shut up against his will within the four seas of Britain.1 I infer then that the Imperial style which was affected by our Kings from \u00c6thelstan onwards was not derived by any continuous tradition from any earlier British or Roman Explana- Empire.

But Ecgberht never assumed any higher style than that of King of the English, and 1 After all the case of an Emperor or tyrant reigning in Britain and Britain only was excessively rare.

It was enough for the West-Saxon King to feel himself well nigh the only independent prince in Western Christendom, without setting himself up as a rival Emperor.

Gaul, Spain, Italy, Denmark, the Slavonic and other less known lands beyond the Elbe, all had bowed to the dominion of the first Teutonic C\u00e6sar. To England alone he had been a model and a counsellor, but not a master. As the one perfectly independent prince in Western Christendom, \u00c6thelstan was the equal of Emperors, and within his own island he held the same position which the Emperors held in the rest of the world. Like an Emperor, he not only had his own kingdom, governed under him by his own Dukes or Ealdormen, but his kingdom was surrounded by a circle of vassal princes who paid to him the homage which he himself paid to no superior upon earth. As no other prince in Western Christendom could claim for his own kingdom the same perfect independence of all Imperial superiority, so no other prince in Western Christendom could show, in a crowd of dependent princes, so perfect a reproduction of the Imperial majesty. And it must not be forgotten that during the first half of the tenth century there was not, as there was before and after, any one Emperor universally acknowledged by all the Christian states of the West. The days of the Carolingian C\u00e6sars were past; the days of the Saxon C\u00e6sars were not yet come. Guy, Lambert, Berengar, were Augusti not less fleeting, and far more feeble, than any of the tyrants of whom Britain had once been so fertile.

Without waiting for any formal coronation, the soldiers of Henry and Otto had saluted their victorious Kings as Imperatores and Patres Patri\u00e6, and, with the same feeling, \u00c6thelstan assumed, or received from his counsellors, the titles which placed him on a level with them. The new birth of the Empire Revival during the reign of Eadgar, the coronation of Otto the Empire Great, which at once restored to the Imperial crown no ?ng e,r Otto small share of its ancient power and dignity, would by not likely no means tend to make our princes lay aside any Imperial the Eng claims which they had already asserted. Eadgar was on withdraw the best terms with his Imperial uncle ; still it might be their Im\" r \u00b0 perial thought needful to assert that England owed him no kind claims. of homage, and that the other princes of Britain owed homage to Eadgar and not to Otto. Here then, as it seems to me, and not in any traditions of Ambrosius or Carausius, is to be found the true expla nation of the otherwise startling title of Emperor of Britain. That title was meant at once to assert the inde- Pull ii pendence of the English crown upon any foreign superior, imperial and to assert the dependence of all the other powers of tltles' Britain upon the English crown. It was meant to assert that the King of the English was, not the homager but the peer, alike of the Imperator of the West and of the Basileus of the East, and it was meant to assert that Scots, Welsh, and Cumbrians owed no duty to Rome or to Byzantium, but only to their Father and Lord at Winchester.

They were Kings of England, and they knew the strength and value of England ; some of them had wisdom enough to value England for her own sake ; still in the eyes of all of them, one main value of England was to serve as a nursery of men and a storehouse of money to serve their plans of continental ambition. They were Kings of England, but they were also Counts of Anjou, Dukes of Normandy and Aquitaine, striving after an equality with their liege lord at Paris, sometimes per- haps after a superiority over him. The British Empire in which \u00c6thelstan gloried, and in which Cnut in the midst of his Northern triumphs gloried no less, was assuredly not despised by the wisdom of Henry of Anjou. But if it was one object of his policy, it was not the only one. In the eyes of the Poitevin knight-errant who came after him, it seemed hardly worth keeping; and it was something which could not be kept in the grasp of John and Henry the The old Third.

But traces of the old ideas still lingered on. the ideas. Through the fourteenth, the fifteenth, the sixteenth cen- turies, a chain of instances may be put together which show that the idea of an Empire of Britain was not wholly for gotten.1 Even when no Imperial claims were put forward on behalf of England, it was thought needful carefully to shut out all claims on the part of any other power to Im perial supremacy over England. And in the sixteenth cen tury, along with the revived study of our early history, the Imperial titles themselves revive in a more definite form. The Imperial character of the English sovereignty was 1 See Appendix B."], [189, "LATER ASSERTIONS OF IMPERIAL CLAIMS. 145 strongly asserted both by Henry the Eighth and by chap. m. Elizabeth. In the days of Charles the Fifth a denial of all dependence on the Roman C\u00e6sar may have been no less needful than a denial of all dependence on the Roman Pontiff. Henry may well have deemed it prudent to take the same precautions against his Imperial nephew which Eadgar had taken against his Imperial uncle. Protests of the like sort were again made in the reign of Elizabeth. We find her more than once formally described as Empress, an Empress whose Empire reached from \" the Orcade isles to the mountains Pyjenee.\" In this last description we find the key to the style. An Empire implied subordinate kingdoms. Elizabeth claimed to be Empress as being independent of the continental Emperor ; she also claimed to be Empress as having a royal vassal within her own island. The same phrases which assert the independence of England upon the Austrian Emperor also assert the dependence of Scotland upon the English Empress.1 This then I believe to be the true account of the Impe- rial titles and Imperial pretensions of the English Kings in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Our Kings meant to assert at once their own perfect independence and the dependence of the other princes of Britain upon them.

Wessex held the supremacy over England ; Eng land held it over Great Britain; Great Britain held it over Ireland and a crowd of smaller islands and colonies ; the United Kingdom holds it over colonies and depen dencies of every kind, from Man to New Zealand. Since the days of the Roman Commonwealth, no other land has had so large an experience of the relations between a central power and half-incorporated states of various kinds. In this sense, England is now a more truly Imperial power than any other in the world. Putting aside the local associations of Rome and Constantinople, no modern state comes so near to the notion of an Empire as understood either by \u00c6thelstan or by Otto.

I thus bring to an end my survey of the political con dition of England and its dependent states in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The dominion won by Eadward and \u00c6thelstan was handed over unimpaired to William the Bastard. We have seen what that dominion was. There was a home monarchy in which the power of the King was strictly limited by law, but in which his per sonal influence was almost unbounded. There was also an external lordship over a body of vassal princes who had the right and the duty, though perhaps but seldom the will, to appear in the Great Council of their Over-lord along with the Bishops and Ealdormen of his own realm. This dominion was, by the forced election of the English Witan, transferred to the hands of the Norman Conqueror. Under his successors the character of the. monarchy gradually altered, but it altered far more through a change in the spirit of the administration than through actual The old Kingdom and Em pire trans ferred to William.

The power of the crown was vastly chap. hi. increased in the hands of William and his sons, and in after the Conquest. other respects the kingdom gradually changed from the old Teutonic to the later medi\u00e6val form. But it was always the constitutional doctrine that William, a legal claimant of the crown, received the crown as it had been held by his predecessors. It follows that a thorough knowledge of the position of those predecessors, of the nature of their authority and of the limits on their power, is absolutely necessary, if only to understand the position of the Norman Kings, what changes they made and what changes they did not make. What was the real nature and amount of those changes, political and social, will be shown in my last volume. And, along with them, I shall deal more specially with some points, like language and art, the earlier forms of which are most fittingly treated of by way of comparison with their later forms. For the present we turn for a while from the history and state of England as they stood under \u00c6lfred and his immediate successors, to trace out the early history of the land which became closely connected with England in the course of the tenth century, and which sent forth the conquerors of England in the eleventh. L a"], [192, "CHAPTER IV. SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF NORMANDY DURING THE TENTH CENTURY.1 THE two foreign conquests of England which form the main subject of English history during the eleventh century were the work of nations which came originally 1 For the Norman and French history of the tenth century there are three principal authorities. The only writer on the Norman side is Dudo, Dean of Saint Quintin, whose work will be found in Duchesne's Rerum Normannicarum Scriptores. His history is nearly coincident with the century, going down to the death of Richard the Fearless. He is a most turgid and wearisome writer, without chronology or arrangement of any kind. He is in fact one of the earliest of a very bfjd class of writers, those who were employed, on account of their supposed eloquence, to write histories which were intended only as panegyrics of their patrons. It is only just before the end of his narrative that Dudo begins to be a contemporary witness ; up to that time he simply repeats such traditions as were acceptable at the Norman court. Of the two French writers, Flodoard or Frodoard, Canon of Rheims (whose Annals will be found in the third volume of Pertz), is a far more valuable writer in himself, but his notices of Norman affairs are few and meagre. He perhaps avoids speaking of the terrible strangers any more than he can help. Flodoard is a mere annalist, and aspires to no higher rank, but in his own class he ranks very high. He is somewhat dull and dry, as becomes an annalist, but he is thoroughly honest, sensible, and straightforward. His Annals reach from 919 to 966, the year of his death, so that he is strictly contemporary throughout. The other French writer is Richer, a monk of Rheims, whose work was discovered by Pertz. and is printed in his third volume (also separately in his smaller collection, and in a French edition by M. Gaudet, with a French translation, 2 vols. Paris, 1845). He was the son of Rudolf, a knight and counsellor of King Lewis the Fourth, and derived much of his information from his father. He also makes use of the work of Flodoard. He goes down to 998, which was seemingly the year of his death. Richer is not"], [193, "CONNEXION BETWEEN NORMANS AND ENGLISH. 149 of the same stock. First came the Danes themselves ; chap. iv. then came the Normans, the descendants of Danish or Normans r-i andEng other Scandinavian settlers in Gaul. In mere blood there- lish origi fore the Normans were allied in different degrees to all the Teutonic inhabitants of Britain, and they were very closely allied to the descendants of the Danish settlers in the North and East of England. And there can be little doubt that this original community of blood really had an important practical effect, and that the speedy fusion of Normans and English was greatly promoted by the fact that conquerors and conquered were in truth kinsmen. But this influence was a purely silent one, and it was in Practical, no way acknowledged by those on whom it acted.

It needed no historical research to find it out ; it was something which men of both nations could feel for themselves. Among the earlier Teutonic settlers in Britain, we can well believe that there were some whose original kindred with the Teutons of Scandinavia was quite as close as their original kindred with some of their fellow Teutons in content with being an annalist ; he aspires to be an historian. He is much fuller and more vivid than Flodoard, but I cannot look on him as equally trustworthy. On this writer see Palgrave, History of Normandy and England, i. 748. The second volume of Sir Francis' own work contains a most vivid, though very discursive and garrulous, history of the time before us, full of all the merits and defects of its author. I would refer to an article of mine on it in the Edinburgh Review for April 1859; also to another, \"The Franks and Gauls,\" in the National Review for October 1860, since reprinted in my first series of Historical Essays."], [194, "HISTORY OF NORMANDY. 150 Britain. Anyhow, the languages of the two nations were closely allied ; their institutions were very similar, those of England being doubtless the more advanced and regu larly organized of the two. Religion formed the main difference between them ; but the Danes in England soon adopted the Christian faith, and they were followed, after no very great interval, by their brethren in Denmark. Thus the Danish settler in England, when once baptized, readily became an Englishman, differing from the Angle or the Saxon only as the Angle and the Saxon differed from one another. This absorption into a kindred nation is less remarkable than the fact that the same people in another land adopted, with not much greater difficulty, a language and culture which was wholly alien to them. For, as the Danes who settled in England became English men, so the Danes who settled in Gaul equally became Frenchmen. The Normans of the eleventh century were men of Scandinavian descent who had cast away every outward trace of the language, manners, and feelings which made them kindred to Englishmen, and had adopted instead the language, manners, and feelings of Latin France. Before they landed in England, they had become Frenchmen ; though still proud of the Norman name, they were content, as speakers of the French tongue, to call themselves Frenchmen in distinction from the Teutonic English.1 No doubt the old Scandinavian element was still at work within them ; it made them Frenchmen on a far nobler and grander scale than other Frenchmen, and it enabled them, when they had once settled in England, unconsciously but surely to become Englishmen. Still, when they followed their Duke to the conquest of England, they were in every outward respect no longer Scan dinavians but Frenchmen.

General Effects of the Scandinavian Settlements in Gaul. The settlement of the Northmen in Gaul, and their con- Import- sequent change into Normans, is the great continental Norman event of the first half of the tenth century; it challenges settlement a place alongside of the restoration of the Empire by Otto in the second half. Its beginnings indeed might seem Compari- small. A band of Scandinavian pirates settled in Northern settlements Gaul, exactly as another band of Scandinavian pirates had, p and thirty years before, settled in Eastern Britain. In both cases the sovereign of the invaded land found it expedient to secure the safety of the rest of his dominions, by sur- rendering a portion of them to the invader and by requiring baptism and nominal homage as guaranties for peace and good neighbourhood. The settlement of Rolf in Neustria exactly answers to the settlement of Guthrum in East- Anglia. Charles the Simple and his counsellors may well have justified their act by quoting the example of \u00c6lfred himself. But the results of the two events were widely different.

Till the ninth century there was no geogra phical division which at all answered to modern France.2 Charles the Great more than once contemplated a division of his Empire ; but not one of his proposed divisions coin cided even in the roughest way with the limits of the kingdom of the Valois and the Bourbons.

The final settlement of Verdun confirmed the existence of the new kingdom. The Empire was then divided into three kingdoms, the Western, the Eastern, and the narrow debateable ground between them, known as Lotharingia. This last kingdom fell to pieces, while the kingdoms on each side of it grew, flourished, and con- tended for its fragments.

There it was that the rebels assembled who seized and imprisoned, and at last deposed, the pious Emperor.1 Later in the ninth P\"\u2122 the century Paris won for herself a more honourable renown ; wark she became the bulwark of Gaul against the inroads of the Northmen Northmen. The pirates soon found out the importance of the position of the city in any attack or defence of Gaul on her northern side. The Seine, and Paris upon the Seine, now became the great objects of Scandinavian attack. Thrice in the reign of Charles the Bald did the invaders enter the city. At last a new power was formed, Formation chiefly with the object of defending Gaul from their March of attack. A large district was granted in fief by Charles gg\"8' the Bald to Robert the Strong, as a march or border territory, to be defended against the invading Northman and the rebellious Breton. And of this march, under Robert's son Odo, Paris became the head. The power thus formed was destined to a career which seems not unusual for such frontier districts. Rome herself, then still the home of Empire, had begun her own career as a march of the Latin against the Etruscan. So, in later times, the Mark of Brandenburg, the outlying defence of Germany against the Slave, and the Eastern Mark, her out lying defence against the Magyar, have, under the names of Prussia and Austria, eclipsed the older names of Saxony, Swabia, Bavaria, and Eastern Francia. So it was with this outlying march granted to Count Robert by Charles the Bald. Paris now became a centre, a capital; if not a royal, at least a ducal, city. The fief of Robert grew 1 \"The City of Revolutions begins her real history by the first French Revolution.\" Palgrave, i. 282.

On the deposition of Charles the Third ineffectual attempts were indeed made on behalf of other candidates, but, in the Odo elected end, Count Odo was elected and consecrated to what now 888/ begins to be called the Kingdom of France, a kingdom over 1848. which his descendants were still reigning thirty years ago.1 Odo of Paris then became \" Rex Francorum,\" in a sense which, as applied to his family, we cannot better represent than by the title of \" King of the French.\" His own family was of German descent ; 2 but, throughout the fol lowing century, his dynasty represents, perhaps quite unconsciously, the growing French nationality, just as the dynasty of Laon represents the decaying Teutonic element. The Dukes and Kings of Paris spoke French long before the end of the tenth century, while the Karlings of Laon still spoke their ancestral Frankish.3 The hundred years' struggle between the Carolingian house at Laon and the Capetian4 house at Paris now begins. This period falls naturally into two stages. In the first stage, the lords of Paris directly disputed the crown with the heirs of Charles ; in the second, they preferred the position of king makers to that of Kings. Odo was elected as the hero of ' On the sieges of Paris and the origin of the Parisian dynasty, see more in Historical Essays, first series, \" The Early Sieges of Paris.\" 2 Richer, i. 5. \" Hie [Odo] patrem habuit ex equestri ordine Rotbertum ; avum vero paternum, Witichinum advenam Gerinanum.\" 3 See Appendix \"V. 4 I use this familiar name prospectively, as I know not what other to put in its place.

It was in beltl the course of his troubled reign that the Scandinavian invaders made that settlement in Gaul which grew into the Norman duchy. It was at his hands that the first Norman Duke received the investiture of his dominions. But the settlement was made at the immediate cost, not of the Carolingian King at Laon, but of the Capetian Duke at Paris. It was from France, in the strictest sense, that Normandy was cut off. The lord of Rouen now stepped in as a kind of umpire between the two rival powers, and throughout the whole struggle of the century no question was of greater importance than whether the power of Normandy should be arrayed on the side of Paris or on the side of Laon. We have now to record the history of the Norman settlement itself, and the history of the Normans in Gaul during the period of struggle, and to show how important an element they were in determining the controversy in favour of the competitor most foreign to their own ancient blood and speech. \u00a72.

The two stories are nearly"], [206, "HISTORY OF NORMANDY. 160 the same, except that the Gaulish part of the tale especially reads, so to speak, like one long reign of \u00c6thelred from the very beginning. There is nothing at all answering to our long succession of great and victorious Kings from \u00c6lfred onwards. That such was the case was not wholly the fault of the princes who reigned in any part of the Empire. The power of the great Charles had kept the heathen in awe, but it is not granted to every man to be a Charles or even an \u00c6thelstan. When the great Emperor was gone, when the terror of his name was forgotten, ceaseless internal divisions made his Empire an easy prey. Those divisions were themselves inevitable, but they brought with them their inevitable consequences ; the land lay open, almost defenceless, before the enemy. Indeed the divisions were actually more fatal because they were not complete ; the very amount of unity which the Empire still kept proved a further source of weakness. The Empire did not at once split up into national king doms, divided by ascertained boundaries, each of them actuated by a national feeling and capable of national resistance to an invader. The state of things was not unlike the elder state of things in the days of the tyrants or provincial Emperors. In those days each ambitious general gave himself out as C\u00e6sar and Augustus ; he aspired to the whole Empire, and he held such portions of it as he could win and keep. So now every King was a King of the Franks, ready to hold so much of the common Frankish realm as he could win and keep. Between potentates of this kind there could hardly be either the same formal alliances, or the same sort of international good understanding, which may exist be tween really distinct nations, each of which is assured of its own position. None of the rival Kings could feel sure that any other King would help him against the common enemy. None of them could feel sure that some CHAP. IV.

It followed therefore that the invaders never encountered the whole strength of the Empire, that they seldom encountered the whole strength even of any one of its component kingdoms. The Carolingian princes, as far as mere vigour and ability goes, have been grossly and unfairly depreciated.1 The truth is that most of them were men of by no means contemptible natural gifts, but that they were, partly by their own fault, partly by force of circumstances, placed in a position in which they could not use their real vigour and ability to any good purpose. Thus the whole second half of the ninth century is taken up with almost uninterrupted incursions of the Scan dinavian pirates on the whole coast of both the Eastern and the Western kingdoms. Germany indeed, owing to Position of the inland position of the greater part of her territory, remained comparatively unscathed. She suffered far more from the Magyars than she suffered from the Northmen. Still the whole Saxon and Frisian coast was as cruelly ravaged as any other part of Europe, and the great rivers afforded the heathens the means of making their way far into the interior of the country. The Western Kingdom, Gaul, with its far greater extent of sea-board, suffered far more severely than the Eastern. Even the Mediterranean coasts and Italy. of Burgundy and Italy were not wholly spared,2 though in those seas the Northman was less to be dreaded than the Saracen. In all these countries we find the same kind of devastations which we find in England. In the course 1 Sir Francis Palgrave has altogether upset the vulgar error which looks on the later Karlings as a line of utterly incapable Kings, like the later Merwings.

But we nowhere find any such steady check put to their progress as marks the first half of the tenth century in England. That is to say, no Carolingian prince had the means, even if he had the ability, to carry out the vigorous policy of Eadward the Elder. Yet it would be unjust to withhold their due share of honour from several kings and princes who at Victory of least did what they could. The Emperor Arnulf in the Arnulf, 8yi ; East,1 the young King Lewis in the West,2 gained glorious of Lewis, andj for the moment, important victories over the invaders, and the triumph of Lewis is commemorated in one of the earliest surviving efforts of High-German poetry.3 The great siege of Paris and its defence by Odo have already been spoken of as among the determining causes which led in the end to the change of dynasty. But such victories were, after all, mere momentary checks ; they delivered one part of the country at the expense of another, and the evil went on till it was gradually cured by various indirect The ra- means.

The Danish settle ments in Gaul were therefore scattered, while in England they were continuous. The Danes in England therefore, though they gradually became Englishmen, still kept on a distinct local existence and local feelings, and they con tinued to form a distinct and important element in the country. But the Danish settlers in Gaul, holding a district here and a district there, sank much more com pletely into the general mass of the inhabitants. Some of these settlements were a good way inland, like Hasting's settlement at Chartres.1 Ragnald too occupied, at least for a while, the country at the mouth of the Loire.2 But these settlements led to no permanent results.

But it is well to bear in mind that it was only one colony among several, and that, when the grant was made, it was probably not expected to be more lasting or more important than the others. But, while the others soon lost any distinctive character, the Rouen settlement lasted ; it grew, it became a power in Europe, and in Gaul it became even a determining power. It is perhaps the unexpected developement of the Rouen settlement, together with the peculiar turn which Norman policy soon took, which accounts for the bitterness of hatred with which the Northmen of Rouen are spoken of by the French writers down to at least the end of the tenth century. By that time they had long been Christian in faith and French in speech, and yet the most truly French writer of the age can never bring himself to speak of them by any other name than that of the Pirates.1 To this feeling we see nothing at all analogous in English history. We see traces of strong local diversities, some times rising into local jealousies, between the Danes in England and their Anglian and Saxon neighbours ; but there is nothing to compare with the full bitterness of hatred which breathes alike in the hostile rhetoric of Richer and in the ominous silence of the discreet Flodoard.

We have no really contemporary narrative of his actions, unless a few meagre and uncertain entries in some of the Frankish annals may be thought to deserve that name. I cannot look on the narrative of our one Norman writer, put together, from tradition and under courtly influence, a hundred years after the settlement, as at all entitled to implicit belief. Even less faith is due to Northern Sagas put together at a still later time. The French authors again are themselves not contemporary,2 and their notices are exceedingly brief. I therefore do not feel myself at all called upon to narrate in detail the exploits which are attributed to Rolf in the time before his final settlement. He is described as having been Earlier engaged in the calling of a wiking both in Gaul and in j^1,/ Britain for nearly forty years before his final occupation 87r,-9iI ? of Rouen,3 and he is said to have entered into friendly relations with a King \u00c6thelstan in England.

From this Latin form modern French writers have, oddly enough, made a form Rollon. The strangest form is Rodla, which occurs in a late manuscript of the English Chronicles (A. 8711. Thorpe's ed.). This was clearly meant to be an English form of Rollo. The English masculine ending a was substituted for the Latin 0, just as Giso and Odo are in English Gim and Oda. The writer also clearly thought that Rnllo was a name of the same type as Robert and others, and he fancied that by putting in a d he was restoring it to its genuine Teutonic shape. 2 Flod >ard was perhaps contemporary with the settlement, but we have no narrative of those years from his hand.

Anglia.1 In all this there is nothing improbable, but we can hardly look upon it as certain. And the exploits attributed to Rolf are spread over so many years,2 that we cannot help suspecting that the deeds of other chieftains have been attributed to him, perhaps that two leaders of (the same name have been confounded. Among countless expeditions in Gaul, Britain, and Germany, we find Rolf charged with an earlier visit to Rouen,3 with a share in the great siege of Paris,4 and with an occupation or destruction of Bayeux.5 But it is not till we have got some way into the reign of Charles the Simple, not till we have gone through several years of the tenth century, that Rolf begins clearly to stand out as a personal historic Rolf in reality.

Rolf was not dislodged from Rouen, nor was his career of havoc and conquest at all seriously checked.

All this we may safely put aside, partly as the deliberate creation of Norman vanity, partly as the inflated rhetoric of an author who was writing as the mere laureate of the Norman court. The historian's own tale of the homage, with its real or mythical incidents, is of itself enough to upset his constitutional theories. That Rolf did homage is plain enough, and, on Rolf's death, his successor in the duchy renewed the homage. But I must again repeat the Little caution how little of real subjection is implied in such submission vassalage at any time, and how purely nominal it became \u2122phed whenever the lord was weak and the vassal strong.

In the hands of Charles the Great or of \u00c6thelstan such an over-lordship as this was a reality; in the hands of \u00c6thelred or of Charles the Simple it was a mere name. Yet Rolf undoubtedly proved a really faithful vassal to King Charles. No doubt his interest happily coincided with his duty. Still we can well believe that in a new Christian and a new vassal, and a man evidently disposed honestly to do his duty in his new state of life, the sense of right and wrong, in this as in other respects, may well have been far stronger than it was in Dukes of Paris or Burgundy who had long been used to form and to break such engagements with equal ease. It must not be thought that the district now granted to 1 See Appendix W."], [216, "HISTORY OF NORMANDY. 170 chap. iv. Rolf took in the whole of the later duchy of Normandy. Extent Rouen was the heart of the new state, which took in lands of the territory on both sides of the Seine. From the Epte to the sea was to Ro!f. its undoubted extent from the south-east to the north. But the western frontier is much less clearly defined. On the one hand, the Normans always claimed a certain not very well defined superiority over Britanny as part of the original grant. On the other hand, it is quite certain that Rolf did not obtain immediate possession of what was afterwards the noblest portion of the heritage of his The Bessin descendants. The Bessin, the district of Bayeux, was not catentin won till several years later, and the Cdtentin, the peninsula sitfons!:qUi\" of Coutances, was not won till after the death of Rolf. The district granted to Rolf was doubtless, as in the case of Guthrum, mainly determined by the extent of his actual possessions. If, as is most likely, the Dive was the western boundary, the ceded territory answered to nothing in earlier geography, civil or ecclesiastical. It was larger than the diocese of Rouen ; it was very much smaller No geo- than the province. As a new division, it had \u2014 sharing graphical name for therein the fate of Germany and France \u2014 no recognized Northman- geographical name. Its inhabitants were the Northmen, norum.\" tne Northmen of the Seine, the Northmen of Rouen.

So in Britain the vague description of the Benalagu supplanted the ancient names and boundaries of more than one Old-English kingdom.

What Normandy became shows plainly enough that its first prince must have been a worthy forerunner of our own Cnut. Once settled in the land, he seems to have become as eager for its welfare as he had before been for its devastation. He must have promoted the general adop tion, not only of the religion, but of the speech and manners of his neighbours. Otherwise Normandy could never have played the part which it did play even in the next reign, nor could his capital have become so thoroughly French as it was within a short time after his death. But of the early institutions and early internal No records of Gstrly history of Normandy all records have perished, or, more Norman probably, no records ever existed.

But it is from the . , peasant certain that, a hundred years after the conquest, there TqJ77 was a peasantry at once oppressed enough and powerful enough to rise in a well-organized revolt.1 Though in Normandy, as in England, the condition of the private settlers is likely to have gradually sunk, still we cannot believe that any descendants of the original conquerors could, in so short a time, have been brought down to such utter bondage. These peasants must have been mainly the descendants of the original Gauls, with whatever intermixture of Roman and Teutonic elements the suc cessive conquests of the country had brought with them. Probable Probably the landowners, great and small, were almost the races universally of Scandinavian descent, while the remnant of the original population had been brought down to a state country. o r~r & of serfdom. It is certain that there is nothing in English history at all answering to this insurrection till we come to the great revolt of the villains of the fourteenth century. This difference seems to point to a wholly different condition of the lower orders in the two coun- Vestiges of tries. As regards the language of Normandy, the Danish the Danish . . -i-i -i \u25a0 i j lancuawe. tongue has utterly vanished out of the land ; it had vanished out of the greater part of the land even before we reach any contemporary records ; still considerable vestiges, strangely disguised as they are, may to this day be made out in the local nomenclature. In Northern Gaul, just as in Eastern England, many a place lost its name, and took a new name from its new Scandinavian lord. Here and there also we find descriptive names, meaningless in French, but which are, with a slight effort, intelligible in English.2 These may, according to their 1 See further on in this Chapter. 2 See Palgrave, i. 700 ; Lappenberg's Anglo-Norman Kings, 97 ; and,"], [219, "173 CONSTITUTION OF THE DUCHY. geographical position, be either remnants of the Danish chap. iv. speech of Rolf and his followers or remnants of the speech of an earlier Teutonic settlement in part of the country of which I shall presently have to speak.

On the absence of such information one illus- Normandy not an tnous inquirer has grounded a theory that Normandy absolute had no assembly, no Parliament, no Estates of any kind, moliarc ?\u25a0 hut that the Duke, Marquess, Patrician, or whatever he is to be called, ruled without any restraint on his personal will. I confess that I find it impossible to accept a theory so utterly repugnant to the analogy of every other Teutonic people. If there be any truth in Norman tradition, the followers of Rolf, as long as they stayed on ship-board, acknowledged no lord, and professed prin ciples of the most extreme democratic equality.2 However this may be, it is not likely that, as soon as they were settled on land, they should at once east away those free institutions which were common to them with all the other branches of the common stock. And there is Instances evidence enough to show that an assembly of some kind action of was often consulted from the very beginnings of the l e tates> Norman state, and especially that the transfer of the ducal crown from one prince to another was effected with much the same forms as the same change would have called for in England.3 At the same time I fully admit that to more at large, Depping, ii. 339.

The Saxons of Bayeux kept on the their name and their distinct being under the Frankish district. dominion ; 2 we can hardly doubt that the Scandinavian settlers found some parts at least of the district still Teutonic, and that nearness of blood and speech exercised over them the same influence which the same causes exercised over the Scandinavian settlers in England. Danes and Saxons were welded together into one Teutonic people, and they kept their Teutonic language and character long after Rouen had become, in speech at least, no less French than Paris. With their old Teutonic speech, the second body of settlers seem to have largely kept their old Teutonic faith. We shall presently find Bayeux the centre of a heathen and Danish party in the duchy, in opposition to Rouen, the centre of the new speech and the new creed. The blood of the inhabitants of the Bessin must be composed of nearly the same elements, mingled in nearly the same proportions, as the blood of the inhabitants of the Danish districts of England.3 To this day there is no Romance-speaking region of the continent in which an Englishman feels himself so thoroughly at home as in this 1 On the history of the Saxons of Bayeux, see Lappenberg, Anglo- Norman Kings, p. 2.

In every part of Normandy, chap. iv. as compared with France or Aquitaine,1 the Englishman feels himself at home; but in the district of Bayeux he seems hardly to have left his own island. The kindred speech indeed is gone ; but everything else remains. The land is decidedly not French ; men, beasts, everything, are distinctively of a grander and better type than their fellows in the mere French districts ; the general aspect of the land, its fields, its hedges, all have an English look. And no contrast can be greater than that which may be often seen between the tall, vigorous, English-looking, Norman yeoman, out of whose mouth we instinctively feel that the common mother-tongue ought to come, and the French soldier, whose stature, whose colour, whose every feature, proclaims him to be a man of another race, and whose presence proclaims no less unmistakeably that the glory of Normandy has passed away. \u00a7 3.

His mother was sword French ; but he did not spring from the union of the con- verted Northman with the royal blood of the West- Franks. Gisla bore no children to her already aged husband, and William was the son of a consort who both preceded and followed her in his affections. She was known as Popa, whether that designation was really a baptismal name or, as some hint, a mere name of endearment. She was the daughter of a certain Count Berengar, and was carried off as a captive by Rolf when he took Bayeux in his pirate days.1 Her brother, Bernard Count of Senlis, plays an important part in the reigns of his nephew and great nephew. Popa and her son seem to have stood in a doubtful position which they share with more than one Norman other Norman Duke and his mother. Rolf and Popa were ish laxity \" most likely married, as the phrase was, \" Danish fashion,\" 2 as to mar- which, in the eyes of the Church, was the same as not being nage. J \u00b0 married at all. A woman in such a position might, almost at pleasure, be called either wife or concubine, and might be treated as either the one or the other. Her children might, as happened to be convenient, be either branded as bastards or held entitled to every right of legitimate birth. Rolf put away Popa when he married King Charles's iv. 1 23), and M. Francisque Michel (note on Benolt, v. 8349) is inclined to believe it. It runs thus ; \" Postea vero [Rosus, see above, p. 165] factus Christianus a sacerdotibus Francorum, imminente obitu, in amentiam versus, Christianos captivos centum ante se decollari fecit in honore, qu\u00e6 coluerat, idolorum, et demum centum auri libras per ecclesias distribuit Christianorum in honore veri Dei in cujus nomine baptismum susceperat.\" But the manuscript which Pertz follows in his text does not make the sacrifice take place immediately before his death, and it is as well to see how Ademar's whole story hangs together. He makes his \"Rosus\" be defeated by King Rudolf in the battle of Limoges in 930 ; he then retreats, and finding Rouen unoccupied, takes possession. 1 Dudo, 77 D ; Benolt, v. 4122. 2 Will.

Popa back again.1 So William, Popa's son, put away Sprota, the mother of his son Richard, when he married Liudgardis of Vermandois.2 This strange laxity with regard to marriage, though spoken of as something specially Danish, was in truth hardly more Danish than Frankish. The private history of the Frankish Kings, Merwings and Karlings alike, is one long record of the strangest conjugal relations. Ordinary concubinage is not amazing anywhere; what stands out specially conspicuous in the history of these Kings \u2014 nowhere more conspicuous than in the history of the great Charles \u2014 is the liberty which they assumed of divorcing their Queens at pleasure, and some times of having several acknowledged Queens at once. William, born of a doubtful union of this kind, was far William more French than Danish in feeling. His tutor was Erench Botho, a Danish companion of Rolf, but one who threw than himself thoroughly into the French and Christian interest. Such an education made William familiar with the lan guage and feelings of both classes of his subjects ; but his own sympathies lay with the speech, as well as with the creed, of his mother ; he was more at home in Roman ized Rouen than in Teutonic Bayeux. In the existing state of things, divided as the duchy was between the Danish or heathen and the French or Christian party, the personal sympathies of the prince were of the highest importance, and there can be no doubt that the French feelings and Christian convictions of William had a most decisive effect on the history of the Norman state.3 1 Will.

The descendants of those who had originally fled before the English conquerors now sought for safety in the very land from which their fore fathers had been driven.

The Norman historian even puts forth a claim on the part of his Duke to a dominion over England,2 which is 1 Dudo, 93 C. \" Ipse vero in Britannia, nee in tota Francia usquam morari ob metum Willelmi ducis nequivit, sed profugus expetivit auxilium Alstemi Anglorum regis.\" Benolt, 8834 ; \"En Engleterre au rei engleis Alestan, au proz, au corteis, La se remist, la s'en fo'i Deserite' e mauballi.\" a Dudo, 97 B. \" Francisc\u00e6 gentis principes Burgundionumque comites famulabantur ei ; Dacigen\u00e6 et Flandrenses, Anglique et Hibernenses parebant ei.\" Ib.

Still such a boast speaks something as to the feelings which existed between the Danes in Gaul and the great destroyer of the Danish power in Britain. With \u00c6thel stan then, the common champion of Christian and civil ized Europe, at the court which was the common shelter of the oppressed, the common school of every princely virtue, did the Breton prince, fleeing from his conqueror, seek the safest and the most honourable refuge. At a later date, when the influence of \u00c6thelstan on the affairs of Gaul was specially great, Alan and his companions were allowed to return.1 He received a large part of Britanny as a vassal of the Norman Duke ; he appears to have remained steady in his allegiance, and he is henceforth constantly mentioned among the chief peers of the Nor man state.2 But he could win back the actual possession of his dominions only by hard fighting against the inde pendent Normans of the Loire. These pirates, even after Rudolf's victory at Limoges, held many points of the country, and they were hardly more inclined to submit to the Norman Duke at Rouen than to the Breton Count at Vannes.3 Alan restored the ruined city of Nantes, and CHAP.

Flodoard (A. 936) is willing to magnify even an Englishman in comparison with a Norman. William is not named. \" Brittones a transmarinis regionibus Alstani Regis pr\u00e6sidio revertentes terram suam repetunt.\" Dudo mixes up their return with the return of King Lewis, which in Flodoard follows it, and he makes \u00c6thelstan something like a suppliant to William (95 D.) He calls \u00c6thelstan \" An glorum Rex pacificus.\" Was he thinking of Eadgar, who may have come within his own memory ? 2 Dudo, 98 A. \" Ipseque Alanus postea Willelmi mandatis indesinenter inh\u00e6sit.\" Cf. 102 B,C; 113 D; 117 D. 3 Flodoard seems to imply that some of these independent Normans entered Britanny, about the same time as this suppression of the Breton revolt, perhaps even in concert with Duke William (A. 931); \"Incon Nortmannus, qui morabatur in Ligeri, cum suis Britanniam pervadit"], [233, "THE COTENTIN AND AYRANCHIN. 187 did much for his recovered dominions in various ways. chap. iv.

Along with the peninsula of Coutances the Norman Dukes obtained a possession which was afterwards to form a bond of connexion of a singular kind between Normandy and England.1 In comparing the extent of the West-Frankish kingdom at this ag-e with that of modern France in our own day,2 while mentioning many points in which the French frontier has advanced, I had to mention three points where it has fallen back. The Normandy extent of the land whose princes acknowledged a nominal the Chan superior in the West-Frankish King took in Flanders, nel Mands- Barcelona, and the Channel Islands.

As long as the English Kings kept the title either victisque et c\u00e6sis vel ejectis Brittonibus regione potitur.\" Of the return of the Bretons he has two notices.

This insular Normandy remains to this day French in speech, but deeply attached, and with good reason, to the English connexion. The islands form distinct common wealths, dependent on the British crown, but not incor porated with the United Kingdom. This condition of a dependency is perhaps that which best suits a community which has a distinct existence of its own, but which could not possibly maintain its independence as a distinct and sovereign state. Keeping their ancient constitutions, and enjoying the protection of the power of England, the Norman islands unite the safety of a great kingdom with the local independence of a small commonwealth. How much they would lose by becoming a French department I need not stop to point out. But they would also lose, not nearly so much, but still not a little, by becoming an English county. The right of sending one or two members to the British Parliament, where, among so many greater interests, their voice could hardly be heard, would be a poor exchange for their present legislative indepen dence. Parliament can indeed, on any emergency which may call for its interference, legislate for the Norman islands. But it must legislate specially for them, after special consideration of the circumstances of the case. The islands cannot find themselves unexpectedly bound by some piece of general legislation, passed without their knowledge and possibly contrary to their interests. Thus the dependent condition of the islands secures a greater consideration of their interests than they could receive if they formed an integral portion of the kingdom. We occasionally hear of internal abuses in the Channel Islands which are held to need the intervention of Parliament, but we never hear of external grievances laid to the charge chap. iv.

The Norman islands seem to be far chap. iv. more contented as dependencies than those Norwegian Compari- son with islands which, having been formed into a Scottish county, Orkney. have become an integral part of the United Kingdom. The ancient earldom of Orkney, represented in Parliament by a single member, has its wrongs, or at least its griev ances ; of the wrongs or grievances of Jersey or Guernsey no one ever heard. And this singular and beneficial relation in which these interesting little communities stand at this day to the English crown is connected by a direct chain of cause and effect with the revolt of the Bretons against Norman supremacy nine hundred and forty years ago. William, thus become the conqueror of the Bretons, ruled for the present as a French prince. As such, his French speech, French connexions, and French religion, caused him to be hated and dreaded by a large portion of his subjects. A strong Danish and heathen party still sur vived within the older limits of the duchy, and the newly won lands probably contained some of those independent Danish settlements by which Britanny in general was so infested. Out of these two elements a Danish and heathen Revolt of revolt was organized. Its leader was Riulf, seemingly party jn an independent Danish chief settled in the Constantine Normandy peninsula. The story, as we have it,1 reads like a romance. Legendary The rebels rise in arms ; they demand one concession after v\u00b0lt another ; the panic-stricken Duke is ready to yield every- and its sup- \u25a0 a pression. thing; he even proposes to resign his duchy and to flee to his French uncle at Senlis. But he is recalled to a better mind by his veteran counsellor, the Danish-born Bernard. He then wins an almost miraculous victory over the rebels, and, for the time at least, crushes all signs of revolt. These details cannot be accepted as historical ; but one or two points in the story are instructive. The rebels are made to demand the cession of all the country 1 Dudo, 94 et seqq."], [236, "190 HISTORY OF NORMANDY. chap. iv. west of the river Risle. The land which would have been left to the Duke after such a cession nearly answers to the original grant to Rolf, excluding the later acquisitions of Geogra- Bayeux and Coutances. This demand, like everything else racter of in. the history, shows how thoroughly the Norman parties were geographical parties. The Christian and French- speaking Duke might keep Christian and French-speaking Rouen and Evreux ; but the heathen and Danish land to the west must be independent of a prince who had cast Christi- away the creed and speech of his forefathers. On the French other hand, we see that there were men of Danish birth, manners 0j(j companions of Rolf, men who retained a strong supported r ' \u00b0 by a party national feeling, who still distinctly threw in their lot among the . . native with the French party. They wished Normandy to remain an united and independent state ; they had not the slight- est wish to merge Normandy in France in any political sense ; but they wished the Norman duchy to be a member of the general French commonwealth, French in religion, language, and civilization. Such a man was Botho, the old tutor of William and afterwards tutor to William's son ; such were Oslac, bearing a name famous in our own Northumbrian history, and Bernard the Dane, who plays an important part in Norman affairs for many years to William's come. Through the overthrow of the rebellion this party Christian was now dominant, and William reigned as a Christian govern- prince, as a French prince, aiming at an influence in French affairs proportioned to the extent of his dominion on Gaulish soil. Through his whole life he was subject to strong religious impulses, and, according to a legend which may well contain some groundwork of truth, he was with difficulty hindered from becoming a monk in his own foundation of Jumieges.1 Yet he was by no means lavish 1 From this scheme he was dissuaded by the good sense of the Abbot Martin. Those who care to read the Abbot's sermon on the practical and the contemplative life will find it in Latin (diversified with a little Greek) in Dudo, p. 101 et seqq., and in Old-French in Benoit, v. 1 105 7 et seqq."], [237, "CHRISTIAN AND HEATHEN PARTIES. 191 in grants to the Church, and the ecclesiastical foundations, chap. iv. which had suffered so cruelly during the Scandinavian incursions, still remained weak and impoverished, and, in many cases, altogether desolate. His general government is described as just and vigorous, and he seems to have deservedly won the general love of his subjects. And it He does is certain that, though he laboured to bring his dominions break with within the pale of Christian and French civilization, he Dam8h L element. did not wholly cast away the national speech and national feelings of his fathers. It is not unlikely that his policy towards the Danish element in the duchy varied at dif ferent periods of his reign. He may have found that the transformation of a nation must needs be a work of time, that too much haste might hinder the object which he had at heart, that a certain measure of toleration, in language, in manners, and even in religion, might be needful in order to bring about a final change in any of those points. In his later days he may even have Towards gone further than this. After all his efforts to identify his reign himself with the French, and to act as a French prince further ad among other French princes, he still found himself scorned \u2122\u2122^( and hated, still looked on as Duke only of the Pirates. Under the influence of such feelings, he may to some extent have thrown himself into the hands of the Danish party. According to a story which cannot be received as it stands, but which probably contains some germs of truth, he admitted a fresh Danish colony, direct from Denmark, into the newly-acquired peninsula of Coutances.1 1 William of Jumieges (iii. 9) makes Harold Blue-tooth, driven from his kingdom by his son Swegen, take refuge with William Longsword, who allows him to settle in the Cdtentin till he can recover his kingdom. Now Harold's expulsion by Swegen did not happen till long afterwards, and Swegen could hardly have been born when William died. The story no doubt arises from some confusion with Harold's dealings with Normandy in the next reign, but it may very well preserve a memory of some real Danish colonization of the peninsula with or without William's permission."], [238, "HISTORY OF NORMANDY. 192 chap. iv. It is certain that he entrusted his son Richard to the care, not of any French clerk or Bishop, but to his own old Danish tutor, the Danish-bom Botho. The boy was purposely of his son taken to Bayeux, the Teutonic city which Botho himself, Richard. in nig pjrate (jayg; helped to harry. He was sent thither expressly to become familiar with the ancestral tongue, which was already forgotten at Rouen,1 but which was still spoken by the mixed Saxon and Danish popu lation of the Bessin. The boy was to be brought up in a Danish city, but by a native Dane who had accepted Christianity and French manners. We may be sure that no religious apostasy was dreamed of; but William now saw that the sovereign of Normandy must be neither pure Dane nor pure Frenchman, but, as far as might be, Dane and Frenchman at once. Part For the purposes of the present sketch, the internal William7 developement of the Norman duchy, the distinction between Longsword its Danish and its French elements, its relations to its in general history. Celtic neighbours and vassals, are points of more import- ance than the part played by its second Duke in the general politics of Gaul.

The reign of William this period. Longsword forms the most confused part even of the confused Gaulish history of the tenth century. It is a period utterly without principles, almost without de finite parties ; even the strife between Laon and Paris, between the Karling and the house of Robert, between the Frank and the Frenchman, is in a manner lulled as long as Rudolf of Burgundy fills the Western throne. Every vassal of the Western crown sought little beyond his own gain and aggrandizement, and all of them freely 1 Dudo, ii. 112 D.

And William himself added as much to the con fusion as any man, by changing sides perhaps oftener than anybody else. And hardly any practical difference Compari was made by the fact that William seems to have been tweenWil several degrees less selfish and unprincipled than his H8\u2122 Land , & . r r the French neighbours. He was evidently a creature of impulse, Princes. and his impulses, if they often led him astray, often led him to righteous and generous actions. Though we cannot set him down, with his panegyrist, as a saint and a martyr, we can at least see in him far nobler qualities than any that can be seen in the contemporary princes of Vermandois, of Flanders, or even of ducal France. Still the practical difference was slight. William was doubtless morally a better man than his neighbours ; but politically he was as untrustworthy as the worst of them. His plighted faith went for as little as the plighted faith of a deliberate perjurer. Impulse led him to one course one day, and impulse led him to an opposite course the next day. He probably never was intentionally treacherous, but he did as many of what were in effect treacherous actions as the basest traitor among them all. Northern Gaul was at this time divided in very un- Condition equal proportions between the King and several vassal \u00b0 princes more powerful than himself. Of Southern Gaul it is hardly needful to speak; of Aquitaine we hear just Practical enough to show that the lands north and south of the \"e^of Loire were aware of each other's existence, and that a Aquitaine. nominal connexion was held to exist between them. The Aquitanian princes now and then stooped to pay a nominal homag-e to the King- of the West-Franks ; otherwise the South moved in a world of its own, a world which was very slightly touched by the revolutions of Laon, Rouen, or Paris.

But all its fluctuations follow one unvarying principle, namely that its inhabitants preferred the rule of a Karling to that of any one else, but that, when no Karling was to be had, they preferred the rule of a Germany. German to that of a Frenchman. Beyond Lotharingia lay the Eastern Francia, the Teutonic Kingdom, now rapidly rising into greatness under the vigorous Kings The Saxon of the Saxon house. Deeming themselves the true suc- cessors of Charles, speaking his tongue and crowned in his royal city, the Saxon Kings already aspired to reunite the scattered fragments of his Empire. Within the West- Amulf of ern Kingdom we find three chief princes, Arnulf of Flan- xJftHQGrs ders, Herbert of Vermandois, and Hugh of Paris. The Flanders of those days, it should be remembered, reached far to the south of any border which Flanders has had for some centuries past. Calais, Boulogne, and Arras were all Flemish, and in those days Flemish still meant Low- Dutch. Ponthieu was a frontier district, with a Count of its own, whose homage was disputed between Flanders and Normandy. Of the present sovereign of Flanders it is enough to say that his actions show him to have been Herbert of capable of any crime. To the south of Flanders lay Ver dois. mandois, governed by the faithless, unprincipled Herbert, himself of Carolingian descent, but the greatest of all 1 Richer (i. 47) distinctly calls the immediate subjects of Charles the Simple \" Germani.\""], [241, "STATE OF GAUL IN WILLIAM'S TIME. 195 sinners against Carolingian royalty; the gaoler, most likely chap. iv. the murderer, of Charles the Simple. His one object was to extend by any means his comparatively narrow terri tories. More powerful than any other Western prince, far more powerful than his nominal King, was the lord of the Western Francia, the Duke of the French, Hugh the Great of Paris. His dominions took in the The Duchy greater part of central Gaul north of the Loire, but, \u00b0 rance' since the establishment of the Norman duchy, they no where reached to the sea. Ducal Burgundy need hardly Ducal be mentioned ; on the death of Rudolf, Duke and King, urgun y' the duchy was split into several parts, a large share falling to the lot of Hugh himself. Along with these Arch temporal principalities we might almost reckon the me- 0f Rheims. tropolitan see of Rheims, whose Primate, alone among Western bishops, made some faint approach to the posi tion of the princely prelates of Germany. This great and wealthy church constantly formed an apple of dis cord among the temporal powers which surrounded it. The rival princes were always striving, sometimes to thrust their nominees into the archbishopric, sometimes to ap propriate to themselves the estates of the see. A large share of the history of the times is taken up with disputes about the succession to the archbishopric, which some times take the form of ecclesiastical synods, sometimes that of temporal campaigns and sieges. In the end the temporal importance of the see was greatly lessened through the loss of several of its most valuable possessions, among them the famous lordship of Coucy. Among all Hugh the these princes Hugh of France stands out the foremost, alike from the extent of his dominions and from the peculiarity of his personal position. The nephew of King Odo, the son of King Robert, the father of King Hugh, the brother-in-law of King Rudolf, King \u00c6thelstan, and King Otto himself, the Duke of the French never would o z"], [242, "196 HISTORY OF NORMANDY. be himself a King. He had no scruple against making war on the King, none against robbing him of his do minions, none against assuming a complete control over his actions and even keeping him in personal bondage. He had no scruple even against transferring his allegiance from one King to another, against becoming a vassal of the Eastern instead of the Western crown. But if he went thus far, he would go no further ; he would always have a King over him, if only to show how much greater he was than any King ; but a King he himself never would be. Three times at least he might easily have mounted the throne ; but he always declined the glittering bauble that lay within his grasp. In all this there seems something like a guiding principle ; and even in other respects, faithless and ambitious as Hugh was, he was dis tinctly better than some of his fellows. It is some slight comfort to find that a man who was honoured with the hand of a sister of \u00c6thelstan was at least not stained with any such frightful crimes as those which have handed down the names of Arnulf and Herbert to everlasting shame.1 CHAP. IV. His Policy, When William succeeded his father, Normandy was at war with France ; that is, it was at war with Herbert of Vermandois and Hugh of Paris, and with Rudolf of Burgundy, their King of the West-Franks. But Rolf, and after him William, acknowledged no King but the imprisoned Charles. From him Rolf had received his lands ; to him Rolf had done homage ; to him William repeated that homage on the earliest opportunity, and he never did homage to Rudolf till the death of Charles left the Burgundian Duke without a competitor for the kingly title. Peace was made and peace was again con firmed, without any acknowledgement of the usurper's William's relation to the King dom, (927) ; his fidelity to Charles. 926-928 1 I of course assume that Hugh had no share in the murder of William, a point which I shall discuss elsewhere."], [243, "William's relations to the kingdom. 197 claim.

Meanwhile Hugh and Herbert were running their usual course ; it is hardly the duty of an English, or even of a Norman, historian to reckon up the number of times that they transferred their allegiance from Charles to Rudolf and from Rudolf to Charles. It is of more Herbert importance to mark that Herbert, at a moment when m\u00b0age tJ Rudolf and Hugh were both at war with him, did not Henry. scruple to transfer his allegiance to the Eastern King Henry.2 At last Rudolf died, and now a most important Rudolf change took place. It might not be very clear what was \u201e,6' the use of a King, if his vassals, several of them more powerful than himself, might rebel against him and make war on him at pleasure. Still, though all the princes were agreed in allowing to the King the smallest possible amount of territory and power, none of the princes was prepared to do without a King altogether. A Diet of Diet of election was held, of which some most remarkable details the new are preserved.3 The prime mover in the whole matter \u25a0Kms was Hugh the Great. He might himself have become a 1 Flod.

But the Eastern part of the kingdom, where there still lingered some traces of Teutonic blood and speech, some feelings of reverence for the blood of the great Emperor, favoured the election of Lewis the son of Charles, who was now living under the protection of his English uncle. Hugh, according to his invariable policy, declined the crown for himself. He already enjoyed the reality of kingship, and he shrank with a superstitious dread from a title which had brought little gain to his uncle and his brother-in-law and still less to his own father. It was on the motion of the Duke of the French that the assembly agreed to elect Lewis as King of the West Franks, and to send an embassy to \u00c6thelstan to ask for the restoration of his nephew to the throne of his fathers. The embassy passed over into England, and found the King at York.1 It was the year before Bru nanburh, when the presence of \u00c6thelstan was doubtless specially called for in his northern dominions. The ambas sadors spoke in the name of Duke Hugh and of all the chief men of the Gauls, and prayed for Lewis to be their King. \u00c6thelstan, somewhat doubtful of their good faith,2 demanded oaths and proposed a further conference. The King of the English hastened to the coast of Kent, and the Duke of the French to the coast of Flanders, not far from Boulogne.

Several English Bishops and Thegns passed over, having at their head Oda, Bishop of the Wils\u00e6tas or of Ramsbury, afterwards the famous Primate.2 Before \u00c6thelstan would trust his nephew across the sea, he demanded satisfactory oaths from the assembled princes ; otherwise he would give Lewis one of his own kingdoms, where he might reign safely and prosperously.3 This was no empty boast ; the Emperor of Britain had kingdoms to bestow, lower indeed in rank, but safer and more power ful, than the nominal royalty of Laon. The princes of Gaul swore as they were bidden ; but it was agreed that the Duke of the French should be the chief adviser, or rather the protector and guardian, of the new King.4 Lewis crossed the sea ; he landed in the realm which was now his, he sprang on his horse,5 and rode on amid the cheers of his new subjects.

His life was in truth one of preternatural activity. Early adversity, combined with an education at the hands of glorious \u00c6thelstan, had brought out some very vigorous qualities in his young nephew. If Lewis was ambitious, turbulent, and perfidious, he was but paying off Hugh of Paris and William of Rouen in their own coin.

The nominal ruler of a vast realm, led about as an occasional pageant and leaving the government of his dominions to an all-powerful minister, is the exact opposite to a King whose domains have shrunk up to the territory of a single city, and who has to spend his life in hard blows to keep that last remnant of his heritage from the ambition of vassals whose territories are far wider than his own. Lewis had to strive in turn against France, 1 Flod.

And, small as was the extent of the King's actual domains, there was still an abiding reverence for the royal name, which breathes in every page of the chroni clers, and which was not without influence even on the minds of the men who fought against him. Still Lewis had constantly to fight for the small remnant of dominion which was left to him. The restless Herbert had to be driven from a fortress built on the very slope of the King's 938. own rock of Laon.1 The next year we find both William 939. and Hugh in arms against the King in a quarrel arising out of the border disputes of Normandy aud Flanders.2 William was at war with Arnulf, the quarrel between these two great potentates being, if not caused in the first instance, at any rate aggravated by their differences as Affairs of to the affairs of a smaller neighbour. This was Herlwin, 93g Count of Montreuil or Ponthieu, whose dominions lay between Normandy and Flanders.

By the aid of a Norman force, beaded, according to one Montreuil account, by the Norman Duke himself, Montreuil was 27ulf and recovered, and Herlwin reinstated.4 But greater powers recovered than any of these were soon to come on the stage.

That they should have taken refuge at his court would have been only the natural course of things ; but it sounds strange at first that the prisoners should be sent to the King of the English, if not actually as captives in bonds, yet at least as persons over whom some degree of watch was to be kept.1 The explanation is most likely to be found in the close alliance between \u00c6thelstan and Lewis, possibly also in the kindred between \u00c6thelstan and Arnulf, who was, like \u00c6thelstan, a grandson of \u00c6lfred. Just now Arnulf was the friend, and William the enemy, of Lewis, and William was actually excom municated by the Bishops in the King's interest for his harryings of the Flemish territory. That a similar fate fell on Herbert for his aggressions on the lands of the archbishopric of Rheims is less wonderful.2 \u00c6thelstan soon afterwards again appears as the ally of his nephew, even when ties equally strong might have drawn him to wards his nephew's enemies. King Henry of Germany was now dead, and his son, the great Otto, the brother-in-law of \u00c6thelstan, had succeeded to the throne of the Eastern Franks in the same year in which their common nephew had succeeded to the royalty of the West. After some opposition at the hands of his own brothers, the future re storer of the Empire had received the Frankish diadem in the great Emperor's minster at Aachen.

IV. The year in which William Longsword was murdered was an important year in many ways for the whole of Gaul. It marks in some sort the beginning of a new epoch. Besides the death of William and the important events which followed upon it, this year was marked by a birth and a death which had no small influence on the course of affairs. Herbert of Vermandois, the regicide, the tyrant as he is called, died this year, and died, according to some accounts, in a mysterious and horrible fashion.2 His dominions were divided among his sons, except some portions which passed into the hands of Hugh of Paris. The royal power thus lost one of its most formidable enemies, while another enemy yet more formidable was still further strengthened. And this year, for the first time, Hugh had a son to be the heir of his greatness. His English wife Eadhild had died childless; but her successor, Hugh's third wife, Hadwisa, daughter of King Henry and sister of King Otto and Queen Gerberga, now bore him a son, Hugh surnamed Capet, the future King. One can hardly doubt that the birth of his son had an effect on Hugh the Great's policy. He would not be a King himself, but he would put no hindrance in the way of his son being a King. From this time onwards the contrast between the two dynasties, between the old and the new, between the Frank and the Frenchman, between Events of the year 943; death of Herbert of Ver mandois; birth of Hugh Capet.

The English reader will find all he can want in Sir Francis Palgrave. I cannot help also mentioning Miss Yonge's tale of the \" Little Duke,\" where the whole legend is very pleasantly told, though with too great a leaning to the Norman side. 2 Richer, ii. 37 ; R. Glaber, i. 3."], [255, "GERMAN INFLUENCE IN GAUL. 209 Laon and Paris, becomes even more sharply marked than chap. iv. before. From this time onwards also we must remark another Constant tendency which was doubtless closely connected with the o{ Ge\" e one just mentioned, and of which we have already seen the 2^\"^ ln beginning. I mean the continued and constantly strength- affairs. ening influence of Germany, the Eastern Kingdom, in the affairs of the West. The Council of Attigny, with the two Kings of the Franks sitting and acting as colleagues, was but the first of a long series of assemblies of the like kind. It is to Otto that all parties in the Western Kingdom appeal as their natural mediator; the King appeals to him as his natural protector. If the Eastern King receives no formal homage as over-lord, still he is clearly looked on both by Lewis and by Hugh as something more than a mere neighbour and brother. Towards Lewis Otto appears as the senior colleague in a common office ; in the language of the elder dnys of the Empire, the Saxon acts as the Augustus, while the Frank is only the C\u00e6sar.1 While Otto is absent on distant expeditions, his vice-gerent in Lothar ingia, Duke Conrad 2 or Archbishop Bruno, is competent to act in his name as moderator of the Western realm. This From 942 kind of relation between the two kingdoms lasted during t0 9j,3 the whole remainder of the reign of Otto the Great, that is, otj^h during the rest of the reign of Lewis and during the minority and early reign of his son Lothar. The changed state of things in the days of the two cousins, Otto the Second and Lothar, was undoubtedly one determining cause of the fall of the dynasty of Laon. But there was another determin ing cause of its fall with which we have more immediately to do. Under Rolf Normandy had stuck faithfully to the 1 See above, p. 206. 2 On the influence of Conrad, see Flodoard, A. 948, 949, 952 ; Richer, ii. 82, 97. Conrad afterwards lost his duchy.

The towards grant had been made on the express condition that the mandy. Normans should become members of a Christian and Frankish commonwealth. If heathen invasions were to begin again, and to be powerfully helped by men settled on Gaulish soil, the Norman duchy was serving an object exactly opposite to that for which it was founded. In such a case both Duke and King might well feel them selves justified in getting rid of the nuisance altogether. Feudal ideas also were fast developing, and King Lewis may have already begun to entertain some dim notion that wardship over the fief of a minor vassal was a right which of necessity belonged to the lord. In any case, The Chris neither Hugh nor Lewis was unwilling to extend his mend dominions, and at first a large party in the duchy seemed them ready to welcome either of them. The Christian Normans some to were divided between the rival attractions of the King and some to the Duke. The Duke, nearer and more powerful, could Lewls give the most effectual aid at the moment ; the King, more distant, would be less dangerous as a permanent protector, and the kingly title still commanded a feeling of deep, if vague and unreasoning, veneration. Some of the Norman chiefs therefore commended themselves to King Lewis and others to Duke Hugh. This choice of different protectors seems to mark a difference of feeling among the Normans themselves -,1 but the relations of King and Duke were just now unusually friendly, and no immediate dissension seems to have arisen between them on this account.

Lewis, according to them, came of his own accord to Rouen after the death of William, and was received with joy, as he was supposed to have come in order to plan an expedition against the common enemy Arnulf.1 Still from this point it is just possible to patch the two narratives together, though I confess that I receive every detail which comes clothed in the rhetoric of Dudo with very great suspicion. Lewis then, according to this account, remains at Rouen, and a suspicion gets afloat that he is keeping the young Duke a prisoner, and that he means to seize on Normandy for himself.

That Lewis fully intended to keep Normandy can hardly be doubted. That great duchy, with its seven bishoprics, its flourishing capital, its fields and towns and harbours all springing into new life after their recovery from Scan- dinavian havoc, must indeed have been a tempting prize to the King of Laon and Compiegne. If he could not hold both Rouen and Laon, he might be well pleased to make the exchange, and to transfer the seat of his kingship to the banks of the Seine. How far any part of the Norman people was really prepared for such a transfer, how far Lewis was deceived by the false representations of men who only pretended to wish for it, it is impossible to determine. But we can well believe that all Normandy was soon united in hostility to the foreign King. And either by invitation or by accident, a most powerful and faithful ally was ready at hand to help the Normans in Harold their struggle for independence. Denmark, like Sweden th'e^Danes, an(l Norway, had, in this age, out of an union of small [935-985.] principalities, become a single powerful kingdom. Gorm son of the Old, the founder of the Danish monarchy, had died [840-935 ?] after a reign said to have been of extraordinary length,1 and had passed on his dominion to his son Harold, sur named Blaatand, Blue-tooth or Black-tooth. Harold was 974. still a heathen ; in later times he became a compulsory convert to Christianity; but when he had once embraced 985. the faith, he clave stedfastly to it, and lost his crown and life in defence of his new creed.2 And if we can at all trust the account of Harold's conduct in Norman affairs. 1 The chronology of Gorm's reign is of course mythical ; some give him quite a short reign ; others make two or three Gorros. In short, we have hardly any standing-ground in Danish history before the time of Swegen. 2 See above, p. 191, for the rebellion of his son Swegen, which the later Norman writers misplace. Of Swegen I shall have much to say in my next Chapter."], [263, "INTERVENTION OF HAROLD BLAATAND. 217 as given by the Norman writers, it is easy to see that, in chap. iv. his case at least, the seed of the Gospel was sown in the fruitful field of an honest and good heart.1 The heathen Harold's ... ii-i \u25a0 i disiiite wiking, utterly unlike most of his tribe, set an example rested con of straightforward, honest, and unselfish dealing, which Normandy shines all the brighter from its contrast with the endless 945 aggressions and backslidings of the selfish and faithless princes of Gaul. Whatever brought Harold into Nor mandy, he acted there as a disinterested friend of the Norman Duke and his subjects.

That Harold defeated Lewis in a battle on the banks of the Dive is allowed on both sides ; Battle by that the battle was preceded by a conference is allowed on both sides. But the French writers represent the battle as a treacherous attack made by the Danes on a prince who had come in all confidence to a peaceful meeting.5 1 I may for once quote an \" Apostropha\" of Dudo, 125 D ; 0 pius, prudens, bonus, et modestus ; Fortis et constans, sapiensque, Justus, Dives, insignis, locuplesque, sollers Rex Haygrolde.

The Normans, on the other hand, say that the fight was brought about by the imprudence or insolence of Herlwin of Montreuil.1 He who had caused, however innocently, the death of William, he who had ruled in Rouen as the deputy of Lewis, now appeared prominently among the royal troops, and stirred up the wrath of Danes and Normans by his presence. This certainly seems a very lame story, and we may well believe that Harold, how- ever faithful to his allies, might see no crime in practising a little of the usual Danish treachery towards an enemy.

In his pages indeed Richard appears as a King, holding the Norman monarchy in fee of no earthly power. But in those pages he also appears as one who far more than forestalled the work of his descendant, as one who held all Gaul and all Britain, with seemingly Germany and Denmark to boot, as dependencies of his Norman monarchy.2 By the accuracy of the one description we may perhaps judge of the accuracy of the other. CHAP. IV. But the commendation of Normandy to the Duchy of France rests on much better authority. Norman vanity was less inclined to dwell on it than on the alleged independence of Normandy on the kingdom, but it is incomparably the better ascertained fact of the two. In the days of Richard we get our first glimpses of docu mentary evidence for Norman history in the form of charters, and in an extant charter Richard distinctly speaks of the Duke of the French as his lord.3 And it is clear that homage to the Duke carried with it a much more practical relation than homage to the King. Throughout this whole period we find Normandy con stantly acting as a subsidiary ally of France. Hugh is followed in his campaigns by Norman troops, seemingly as a matter of course.4 Practical character of the com mendation of Richard to Hugh. 1 Dudo, 128 D et seqq.

The real question was not whether Hugh or Artald was the more regularly elected Primate, but whether the great city of Rheims should be held by a prince devoted to the Duke or by a prince devoted to the King.

Lewis set forth the whole story of his wrongs before his brother King and the bishops, and prayed both of them to use their several arms, temporal and spiritual, against Final his enemy. The result was, not only that Rheims was Trier ; restored to the royalist Archbishop, but that, after due Great ' e notice> the Duke of the French was solemnly excom- excom- municated in a final synod at Trier,2 which, oddly enough, municated. ... 948. consisted mainly of Western bishops.

CHAP. IV. His death. 954- The long reign of Lothar, the son and successor of Lewis, answers to only a part of the much longer reign of Richard the Fearless. In the course of a few years most of the principalities of Gaul changed masters. Long be fore the reign of Lothar was over, almost before he had personally entered on his government, Richard, so lately a child, the youngest of princes, became the eldest ruler within his own world. King Lewis was dead already; Hugh the Great died two years later ; Arnulf of Flanders, at an almost incredible old age, died nine years later still.2 Otto, King and Emperor, outlived all these princes, but Richard outlived both him and his son. Richard suc ceeded to his duchy in the time of Eadmund of England ; he outlived Eadmund, Eadred, Eadwig, and Eadgar, and lived far on into the reign of \u00c6thelred. In France he beheld and furthered the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty, and he died in the same year as the first King of the permanent Parisian line. But this long period is, if we contrast it with that which went before it, compara tively barren of events bearing on the history of the Norman duchy. Richard wrought great changes within his own dominions, and he had many enemies to contend against without; still the greater part of his reign was no longer one incessant struggle, like the reign of his father and his own early days. For some years wars and disputes went on almost as vigorously as before ; but for Reign of Lothar. 954-986. The old generation of princes dies off. Hugh the Great. 956. Arnulf born 873, died 965.

Duke Hugh espoused his cause ; so did Archbishop Bruno, who now ruled Lotharingia in the name of his brother King Otto.1 But Hugh soon contrived to employ the boy whom he recognized as his sovereign as the tool of his own crafty policy.

But Hugh procured from Lothar a grant of the duchy of Aquitaine, in addition to those of France and Burgundy,4 and it was doubtless in order to enforce this claim that he involved the King in a war with the Aquitanian princes. But Hugh was utterly baffled before Poitiers,5 and, soon after this 1 Flod.

This prince, who, like Arnulf, reached an unusual age, was the son of an elder of Chartres \u201e towards Theobald, who is said to have bought the county ot Richard. Chartres of the famous wiking Hasting.1 The second Theobald had married Liudgardis, the widow of William Longsword and step-mother of Richard ; he was a vassal of the Duke of the French,2 and, in that character, he had acted for Hugh the Great as the gaoler of King Lewis.3 But he seems to have by no means adopted his lord's policy towards the Normans ; on the contrary he appears as the instigator of Gerberga and Lothar to every sort of hostility against Richard.4 The French accounts, which commonly speak of Theobald with a certain tone of con tempt,5 tell us just enough to show that there is some ground of truth in all this. Theobald's chief object seems Theobald to have been the acquisition of Evreux, which at one time Evreux. he actually gained by the help of Lothar.6 Before this, if 9 \u2022 we may trust the Norman tale, Theobald and the King had pi\u201et 0f formed with Bruno, Archbishop and Duke, a treacherous \u00a3otnar> ' r ' Bruno, plot to beguile Richard to a conference at Amiens, and and Theo- ... \u201e bald there to put him to death or imprison him.7 I confess that against this sounds to me very like a Norman perversion of a fact .g1^ which is much better authenticated. King Lothar had summoned to Soissons a general assembly of the chief men of his realm, an event so common in England and Germany government, or else resigned in his favour.

Whether the Duke of the Normans was summoned or not does not appear ; but he came with an armed force and attempted to disperse the assembly, but was beaten off by the King's troops.1 In the next year we find Theobald at war with Richard and defeated by him. Being also on ill terms with his own lord Duke Hugh, he took shelter with Gerberga and Lothar, and was kindly received by them.2 In the Nor man version this grows into a long and striking story.3 Just as in the tale of Lewis and Harold Blaatand, a con ference between Lothar and Richard developes into a battle in which Lothar, like his father, is of course utterly defeated. Yet even while thus victorious, Richard is neither satisfied nor confident. He sends again to King Harold in Denmark ; Harold at once comes at his call, but he has no opportunity of renewing his old exploits. For his enemies are thoroughly afraid of him. Count Theobald at once makes peace, and restores Evreux. King Lothar begs for peace also, and craves that the terrible Danes may be sent away. But it is not so easy to send them away as to bring them in. However Duke Richard does his best ; he goes in person and preaches an eloquent sermon to the pagans, exhorting them to embrace Chris tianity and to settle quietly in the country. This a por tion of them are induced to do, while the stiflhecked heathens are persuaded to sail southwards and to ravage infidel Spain instead of Catholic Gaul. After this a peace CHAP. IV.

The French writers help us to little more than \u201e r Compan the fact that there was some measure of hostility between son of the Tii -i-n-1-i-r.-i-i- i \u25a0 xi) French and Lothar and Richard. Richard tries to disperse Lothar s Norman solemn parliament ; Lothar kindly entertains Richard's accoun 3 vanquished enemy. Where there was as much mutual ill-will as this, it is likely that there was much more. And while we must always allow for the inventions and exaggerations of the Norman writers, we must also allow for the evident unwillingness of the French writers to say one word more about the Normans than they could help. But the whole Norman story is strange and unlikely, and many of the events sound most temptingly like repetitions of earlier events. We seem to be reading the tale of Lewis and Harold over again with but slight changes. Yet the dates come within the life, perhaps within the memory, of our one original informant on the Norman side.2 I leave the more minute examination and final decision of the matter to those with whom Norman history is a primary object. It is enough for my purpose that the few certain facts fall in with the more elaborate picture in the legend, so far as to bring out the same general view of Richard's position as the firm ally of France and as the enemy of the Carolingian crown. During the latter part of the reign of Lothar things Later years took a different turn.

He was ready to be a King as soon as he could become one quietly and with a decent pretext ; but he would not hazard the prize by General clutching at it too soon. The relations between King tween the anc^ Duke during the last twenty years of Lothar were Kmgdom ver\u201e unlike the relations which had existed between the aud the J Duchy of father of Lothar and the father of Hugh. There was very little of open enmity, and when there was any, the wily Duke contrived that it should be the King who was out wardly in the wrong. For a long time Duke Hugh acted as the vassal and friend of King Lothar, and the friendship of Duke Hugh of course carried with it the friendship of Duke Richard. On the whole this was a time of peace, a thing hitherto so unusual, between Duke and King, so much so that the duchy actually underwent a German invasion in the royal cause. For it was now that the relations between the two kingdoms of the Franks again became of paramount importance. It was now that the folly of Lothar forfeited the German protectorate for him self and his kingdom.

As Odo had to struggle with Charles the Simple, so Hugh had to struggle with his grandson Charles of Lotharingia.

To Hugh's own thechange' subjects it made little practical difference whether their prince were called Duke or King. Beyond the Loire, men cared little who might reign either at Paris or at Laon. But though the immediate change was slight, the election of Hugh was a real revolution ; it was the completion of the change which had been preparing for a century and a half; it was the true beginning of a new period. The Duchy of France had successfully played in Gaul the part which in Britain had been played by Wessex, which in Spain has been played by Castile, which in Scandinavia has been less thoroughly played by Sweden, which Prussia before our own eyes has played in Germany.

Everything leads us to believe that Richard took a leading Personal personal share in the revolution, and it is quite certain share of Richard, that, but for the policy which Richard followed, that re- volution never could have taken place. It was the alliance between Normandy and France which determined the fate of the Carolingian dynasty.1 And thus we are led back to the proposition with which I started at an earlier stage The Nor- of this Chapter,2 that it was the settlement of the Scan menVmade dinavians in Gaul which definitively made Gaul French. Gaul They settled just at the point of transition, when the old German state of things was beginning to give way to the new French state of things. The influence of the new comers, notwithstanding their own Teutonic blood and speech, was thrown altogether into the French scale. The Normans became French, because a variety of circum stances brought them more within the range of French influences than of any other. The connexion between Rolf and the Carolingian dynasty was something purely political, or rather personal ; Rolf had done homage and sworn oaths to King Charles, and to King Charles he stuck against all pretenders. But the main object of his successors was to bring Normandy within the pale of Christianity and civilization, in such shapes as Christ ianity and civilization bore immediately before their eyes. This object they naturally sought by establishing a con nexion with their nearest neighbours ; their standard of language and manners was set by the French court of Paris, not by the German court of Laon or by the more Hugo Capeth, adminiculante ei duce Richardo.\" (iv. 19.)

Toulouse. The Normans thus became Frenchmen, and, with the zeal of new proselytes, they became first and foremost in everything that is characteristically French. The earliest and best productions of the new-born French language were the work of Norman poets. All the ideas French which were then growing up in France, ideas which it is rooTm\" hard to express otherwise than by the vague and mis- Normandy leading names of feudalism and chivalry, took firm root in Normandy, and there brought forth their most abundant fruit. Had Normandy remained Danish, the Scandinavian settlement would have been a most important diversion on behalf of the Teutonic element ; Romance Paris would have been in a manner hemmed in between two Teutonic lands. And if the Scandinavian settlement had never taken place at all, the French developement would at least have lost the decisive support which it gained from the enlistment of such fresh and vigorous disciples. It was the Normans, I repeat, who made Gaul French ; it was the Normans who made French Paris the capital of Gaul, and who gave Gaul the French lord of Paris for her King. On the The posi other hand, it was the Capetian revolution which gave Normandy Normandy her definite position in Gaul and in Europe, established Hitherto, in the minds and mouths of good Frenchmen, Capetian and most likely of good Germans also, the Normans were tion. still simply the Pirates, and their sovereign the Duke of the Pirates. Their presence was endured, because they were too strong to be got rid of; but the half-heathen Danish intruders were still hateful to the princes and people of Latin and Christian Gaul. With the election of Hugh Capet all was changed. The firmest ally and supporter of the new dynasty could no longer be looked on as an outcast or as an enemy. The old question as to the relation between Normandy and the Kings of Laon was buried for ever. Whatever relations had hitherto"], [292, "246 HISTORY OF NORMANDY. chap. iv. existed between the Duke of the Normans and the King of the West-Franks, there was no doubt that the Duke of the Normans was the vassal, the most powerful and the most loyal vassal, of the Duke of the French, and the Duke of the French and the King of the West-Franks were now one and the same person. Normandy was now thoroughly naturalized ; the doubtful position which it had held in Carolingian times passed altogether away; it became the mightiest and noblest among the fiefs of Compara- the Capetian crown. And for a long while the relations friendly between the duchy and the crown remained, on the whole, relations friendly. It was not till later days, till Normandy was the duchy under the sway of her greatest Duke, that the old hos crown. tility broke out afresh, and that King Henry of Paris showed himself as eager as King Lewis of Laon to dis possess the prince and people who cut off himself and his city from the mouth of the Seine. Up to the days of Henry and William the good understanding between France and Normandy was seldom broken. And, even counting the wars of Henry and William, we shall find that, considering the power of the vassal and his close neighbourhood to his lord, hostilities between Rouen and Paris were not specially frequent. The rebellions of Hugh the Great alone against the Kings whom he had set up and put down would probably be found to be more in number than the wars between France and Normandy, from the commendation of Richard to Hugh to the day when England and Normandy alike were merged in the vast dominions of the princes of Anjou. Connexion The close connexion between Norman and French his of French . history tory, the way in which we may say that Normandy ge^rll6 created France and that France created Normandy, must subject. be my excuse for dwelling at an apparently dispropor- tionate length on some subjects which are only indirectly connected with English history. In order thoroughly to"], [293, "COMPARISON BETWEEN ENGLAND AND GAUL. 247 understand the Norman Conquest of England, it is almost chap. rv. as needful to have a clear view of the condition and earlier history of Normandy as it is to have a clear view of the condition and earlier history of England. And such a clear view of Norman affairs cannot be had without constant re ferences to French, and occasional references to German, history. And the notices of French history which are needed for this end may serve to illustrate English history in another way. The contrast between the political con- Contrast dition of England and that of the Western Kingdom is most the%poli% striking, even at this early time. Looked at superficially, t].cal co\"\" there is a certain likeness between the two. In both cases, England a King of narrow limited power stands at the head of a Gaul. body of princes, some of whom, in extent of dominion, might almost\u2014 on the mainland not only almost but altogether \u2014 rank as his peers. But when we come to look more narrowly into the matter, we shall see that the likeness is only superficial. In truth there is very little real likeness at all ; and if we admitted a stronger likeness than there is, if we admitted that the two countries had accidentally met at the same point, still their meeting would have been wholly accidental, because the two countries were moving in exactly opposite directions. England was England directly tending to unity; Gaul was directly tending to to^nity, division. In the long run indeed the division to which (fa'.,1.to \u00b0 division. Gaul was tending paved the way for a closer unity than England has ever reached ; but, at the moment, it was to division that Gaul was directly tending. The English in England Pnncss kingdom was formed by the gradual union of many dis- nacl sunk tinct states; to independent Kings had succeeded de- \u2122*\u00b0^\u00b0\". pendent Kings, and to dependent Kings had succeeded Ealdormen appointed by the King and his Witan. Great and powerful as was an English Ealdorman, he stdl was not a sovereign, not even a dependent or vassal sovereign ; he ruled only with a delegated authority; the King was"], [294, "HISTORY OF NORMANDY. 248 chap. iv. supreme, and the Ealdorman was only a governor sent by in Gaul him. In Gaul the process was directly opposite. Local had6grown governors who, under the first Carolingian Kings and in*\u00b0 Emperors, had been simple lieutenants of the sovereign, had gradually grown into hereditary princes, who at most went through the decent ceremony of receiving their do minions as a grant from a King who could not withhold them. The Dukes, Counts, and Marquesses of France, of Flanders, of Aquitaine, of Septimania, of Barcelona, had in this way grown into sovereigns. Starting from the position of an English Ealdorman, they had won the formal position, and more than the practical indepen dence, of a vassal King of Wales or Scotland. Normandy was a real fief from the beginning ; the grant to Rolf was the exact parallel of the grant to Guthrum ; but during the second half of the tenth century the dominions of Rolf were ruled by a native sovereign of his own blood, while the dominions of Guthrum were administered by Difference Ealdormen appointed by the English King. Again, the tations on Power \u00b0f the King was narrowly limited in both king- tile power doms, but it was limited in altogether different ways. of the King . . in England The power of the King of the English was limited, because Gaul. he could do no important act without the consent of his Witan. The power of the King of the West-Franks was limited, because he was shorn of all direct authority beyond the narrow limits of Laon and Compiegne. The King of the English, in the exercise of such authority as the law gave him, was obeyed in every corner of his kingdom. The King of the West-Franks did as he chose in his own city of Laon ; at Paris and Rouen, at Poitiers and Toulouse, he received only such measures of obedience as the sovereigns of those capitals chose to yield to him.

We read of conferences of"], [295, "249 POSITION OF THE LATER KARLINGS. princes ; but they are rarely held, except for some great chap. iv. and extraordinary occasion like the election of a King. An assembly, meeting yearly or oftener, to sanction the ordinary acts of the King and to pass laws binding on the whole kingdom, was something utterly un known. And yet, when we see how narrow was the immediate Amount of dominion, how small were the available resources, of the retained by later Karlings, it strikes us with wonder throughout the J\u00a3e J?ter whole history to see how much influence, how much real power, they still kept. The King, however many enemies may be in arms against him, is always an important person, and he commonly finds an army to bring against the rebel army. We wonder where he got his army, and where he got the resources to set his army in motion. In days when war maintained itself an army was doubtless less costly than it is now, and a victorious army might even enrich its leader. But whence did the armies come ? Surely not wholly from the narrow limits of the King's immediate territory. Nor were they likely to be formed by the spontaneous loyalty of volunteers. The influence of the royal name, the reverence attaching to the blood of the great Emperor, might do a good deal to paralyse the efforts of enemies, but they would hardly of themselves bring distant followers to the royal standard. But the King, if he had few subjects, was not wholly without friends. We find hints that the lesser vassals often found The Kings it their interest to support the King against the encroach- port from ments of the great Dukes. We find that in a war with vanous \u00b0 quarters. one rebellious potentate he was often supported by the rivals of that potentate, and that his more distant vassals helped him against those who were more formidable to them than he was. We find also that he could espe cially rely on the help of those Bishops who, holding directly of the crown, were clothed with the character of"], [296, "250 HISTORY OF NORMANDY. chap. iv. ecclesiastical princes.1 And in the later and more peaceful Increase of i\\mes 0f Lothar and Hugh Capet, the King appears far power un- more clearly than before in the character of an effective head of the kingdom. We read more commonly of con- sultations with the other princes, and we see the King, by common consent, wielding the forces of all his vassals, including those of the Duke of the French himself. The wily Hugh no doubt saw that it was his interest to strengthen in every wajr the power and reputation of the crown which he meant one day to place on his own brow. Altogether we may doubt whether the practical power of the later Carolingian Kings was not really quite as great Power of as that of the early Capetians. The power of the crown not imme- rested mainly on influence and prescription, and influence diately m- an(j prescription were not on the side of the Parisian creased by r *\u25a0 the change dynasty. The immediate territorial dominion of the Pari- ' sian Kings was no doubt much larger than that of the later Karlings ; Paris and Laon together were far greater than Laon by itself. But the connexion between the crown and the great vassals seems to have been distinctly weakened by the change of dynasty. The descendants of Robert and Hugh did not command the hereditary respect which attached to princes sprung from the blood of Charles and Pippin. Some disputed and outlying fiefs were alto gether lost to the kingdom, and the King's sphere of action was far more strictly confined than before to the lands north of the Loire. Lotharingia and the Spanish March fell away; the connexion with Flanders gradually weakened; Aquitaine scarcely acknowledged even a nominal dependence. Assemblies and conferences of the whole king dom, rare before, seem now to go wholly out of use. Even the vassals north of the Loire, even the former 1 See Flodoard's description of Lewis's invasion of Normandy, A. 944 ; \"Ludowicus rex in terram Nortmannorum proficiscitur cum Arnulfo et Herluino et quibusdam episcopis Franci\u00e6 ac Burgundi\u00e6.\""], [297, "POSITION OF THE FRENCH KINGS. 251 vassals of the Parisian duchy, seem to have less connexion chap. iv. with the crown than heretofore. In fact the French Duke lost by becoming King, just as the German King lost by becoming Emperor. As Duke he had been a less dignified, but he had been a more effectual, over-lord. The Parisian Dukes themselves had done more than all the rest of the world to set forth and strengthen the doctrine that the immediate vassals of a King were entitled to practical sovereignty. Thus, while England was getting more and more united, Gaul was getting more and more divided. Under other circumstances, the Western realm might very easily have changed, step by step, from a kingdom into a confederation, just as Germany did.1 But as it was, Isolation the very isolation into which the several parts of the king- ied to closer dom now fell proved in the end the path to an unity umon- such as England never has seen, such as we trust England never may see. Utter isolation paved the way for utter centralization. In England, as the different parts of the realm became more closely united, all shared in a common national freedom, without any complete sacrifice of local and municipal independence. In Gaul the crown annexed, one by one, all the dominions of its own vassals2 and such of the dominions of its neighbours as came within its reach. Thus the whole kingdom knew no will but that of the King. Widely as a modern English Parliament differs from an ancient Witenagemot, the one has grown out of the other by gradual developement, without any sudden change. In France and throughout Gaul the ancient Teutonic assemblies died out altogether, and the comparatively modern States-General came into 1302. being as an original device of Philip the Fair. 1 The different circumstances which led to such different results in France and in Germany I trust to point out in the second volume of my History of Federal Government. 2 With the exception of the three portions of the kingdom which have become wholly detached.

There can be no doubt that the various pro- cesses of which I have been speaking, the Christianizing, the Gallicizing, and the feudalizing process, all went on vigorously in Normandy during the reign of Richard the Growth of Fearless. The doctrine of nobility was fast growing ; it trine of was taking a form quite different from the ancient relations nobility. 0f e0J.i an(j ceor\\f cmite different from the later relations of thegn and ceorl, as they have been at any time under stood in England.

The legends of Lyderic the Forester 2 and of Torquatius and Tertullus 3 point to no very lofty origin on the part Origin of the princely houses of Flanders and Anjou. So it is Norman in the reign of Richard that we find the beginning of baronage, Norman baronage, and the origin of many of its members was certainly not specially illustrious. Some noble families indeed trace their descent up to old com panions of Rolf, such as the house of Harcourt, which claims Bernard the Dane as its patriarch. But the larger part of the Norman nobility derived their origin from the amours or doubtful marriages of the Norman Dukes. Not only their own children, but all the kinsfolk of their wives or mistresses, were carefully promoted by ducal grants or Children by advantageous marriages. Thus Sprota, the mother of folk of Richard the Fearless, during the troubles of her son's Richard. early reign married one Asperleng, a rich miller.

Besides undoubted bastards,3 there was a con siderable brood, including Richard, the next Duke, and Emma, the future Lady of the English, who were legiti mated by Richard's marriage with their mother. These were the children of Gunnor, a woman of Danish birth, to whom different stories attribute a noble and a plebeian origin.4 From these children and from the kinsfolk of Gunnor, all of whom were promoted in one way or another, sprang a large part of the Norman nobility. Meanwhile Progress the principles of feudalism were making fast progress doctrines. both in Normandy and in France. Hugh the Great's doctrine of commendation, practised on so magnificent a scale between the duchies of Normandy and France, was being everywhere carried out with regard to smaller possessions. Such at least is the natural inference from 1 Will.

The wealth of the clergy was also largely increasing. Richard, unlike his father, was munificent in his gifts to the Church, especially to his new, or rather restored, foundation of Fecamp and to the still more famous house of Saint Michael in Peril of the Sea.1 The original foundation of Fecamp was for secular canons.2 It was only in the days of the second Richard that the Benedictine rule was introduced.3 Fecamp, alone among the great monasteries of the Nor man mainland, stands in the land north-east of the Seine ; all the rest lie either in the valley of the river or in the true Norman districts to the west of it. Fecamp, like Westminster, Holyrood, and the Escurial, contained minster and palace in close neighbourhood ; the spot be came a favourite dwelling-place of Richard in his later days, and it was at last the place of his burial. The last years of his reign present only one important event, a dispute, possibly a war, with the English King \u00c6thelred, a discussion of which I reserve for a place in the next chapter in my more detailed narrative of English affairs.

Unlike his enemies, Arnulf and Theobald, whose lives were really prolonged beyond the common span of human existence, Richard the Fearless, or Richard the Old, as he was called to distinguish him from his successor, after all that he had done and undergone, after all the changes that he had wrought and beheld, had lived no longer than sixty-three years. \u00a76. Early years of Richard the Good. 996-997. Richard the Fearless was succeeded by his son Richard, Reign of surnamed the Good, whose reign carries us beyond the tQe qq0(i_ limits of the present sketch into the essential and central 996-1026. portion of our history. Richard was a direct actor in the events which were the immediate causes of the Conquest. He was the uncle of Eadward the Confessor, the grand father of William the Bastard ; and he personally played a certain part in English affairs. I will therefore reserve % his actions for their proper place in my general narrative, and I will here speak of one event only, which marks the complete developement of the influences which had been at work throughout the reign of his father. Richard succeeded to the government of a state in which the Danish tongue, Danish manners, perhaps even the old Danish religion, still lingered in particular spots, but which was now, in the face of other nations, a French state, a member, and the principal member, of the Cape tian commonwealth. He had imbibed to the full all the Aristo new-born aristocratic feelings of feudal and chivalrous ings 0f France. He would have none but gentlemen about him.1 Elcnar<1- This is perhaps the earliest use of a word so familiar both in French and in English, but which bears such different 1 Roman de Rou, 5955-5974."], [302, "256 HISTORY OF NORMANDY. chap. iv. meanings in the two languages. But, whoever was a gentleman in the language of Richard's court, it is plain that the word took in all who could pretend to any kind of kindred or affinity, legitimate or illegitimate, with the sovereign. The way in which the exclusively aristocratic household of Richard is spoken of seems to show that his conduct in this respect was felt to be something different from that of his father. Taken in connexion with what follows, it may well have been the last pound which broke Revolt of the camel's back. Popular discontent broke out in the great peasants, peasant revolt to which I had occasion to allude earlier in 99^ this chapter.1 We may suppose that the peasantry were mainly of Celtic, Roman, or Frankish origin ; that is, that they sprang from that mixture of those three elements which produced the modern French nation. But we may well believe that many a man of Scandinavian descent, many a small allodial holder who was unwilling to com- mend himself to a lord, threw in his lot with the insur- Their regu- gents. What is most remarkable in the story of this organiza- revolt is the regular political organization of the revolters. The systematic way in which they set to work is common enough in cities, but is exceedingly rare in rural com munities. It is almost enough to place this revolt of the Norman peasantry side by side with the more famous and more fortunate revolt of the Forest Cantons against They the encroachments of Austria.

The peasantry of Normandy, like the citizens of Le Mans in after times, \" made a commune.\" 2 Such a constitution could hardly have been devised off hand by mere peasants. We can hardly doubt that it had a groundwork in local institutions which the newly grown aristocracy were trampling under foot, and that the so-called rebels were simply defending the inheritance of their fathers.

The English Chronicles are still our principal guide. For the present they may be quoted as one work, as the differences between the different manuscripts, pointed out by Mr. Earle in the Preface to his Parallel Saxon Chronicles, are not as yet of much strictly historical importance. Florence of Worcester gives what is essentially a Latin version of the Chronicles, with frequent explanatory additions, which his carefulness and sound sense render of great value. The Charters and Laws of the reign of \u00c6thelred are abundant, and, besides their primary value as illustrating laws and customs, the signatures constantly help us to the succession of offices and to a sort of skeleton biographies of the leading men of the time. These, the Chronicles, Laws, and Charters, form our primary authorities. The later Latin Chroniclers, from William of Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon onwards, supply many additional facts ; but their accounts are often mixed up with romantic details, and it is dangerous to trust them, except when they show signs of following authorities which are now lost. This is not uncommonly the ease with both Henry of Huntingdon and William of Malmesbury. Local histories, like those of Ely, Ramsey, and Abingdon, supply occasional facts, but the same sort of cautions which apply to the secondary writers of general history apply to them in a still greater degree. We now also begin to draw some little help from foreign sources. The Danish History of Saxo Grammaticus, the Chronicles of Swegen Aggesson, the various Sagas, especially the famous Saga of Olaf Tryggvesson, are very hard to reconcile with the more authentic notices in our own Chronicles ; but among much that is doubtful and much that is clearly fabulous, they often help us to facts, and to the causes and connexions of facts, which our own writers leave obscure.

With regard to one or two members of the neracy. family the evidence is so contradictory, they were cut off so young or reigned so short a time, that we have no certain knowledge what they really were. But \u00c6thelred stands alone in giving us the wretched sight of a long reign of utter misgovernment, unredeemed, as far as we can see, by any of those personal virtues which have sometimes caused public errors and crimes to be forgotten. Personal beauty and a certain elegance of manners, quali ties consistent with any amount of vice and folly, are the highest merits attributed to a prince, who, instead of the Unconquered, the Glorious, the Magnificent, or the Peace ful, has received no nobler historical surname than that of the Unready.1 His actions display a certain amount of energy, perhaps rather of mere restlessness. It was at any rate an energy utterly unregulated and misapplied, an energy which began enterprises and never ended them, importance for the events which connect England and Normandy. For the early part of the reign of \u00c6thelred we have no contemporary Norman writer, but the accounts in the Roman de Rou and in William of Jumieges at least show us what was the Norman tradition. Later in the period, we have, in the Encomium Emm\u00e6 (reprinted in the nineteenth volume of Pertz by the name of \" Gesta Cnutonis \"), the work of a contemporary Norman or Flemish writer, which, though throughout unfair aud inaccurate, is worth comparing with our English writers. Occasional notices of Danish and English affairs are sometimes to be gleaned from the German writers, like Adam of Bremen and the contemporary Thietmar of Merseberg. On the whole the materials for this period are ample, and, as regards England, they are fully trustworthy. The difficulty lies in reconciling the English and continental narratives. 1 \" Unready \" must mean \" lacking rede \" or counsel. Walter Map (De Nugis, 199) calls him \"Edelredus, quern Anglici consilium [insilium ? see below, p. 317] vocaverunt, quia nullius erat negotii.\" \"Magnificus,\" the epithet of Eadmund the First, means rather \"worker of great deeds\"\u2014 the Greek peyaKorrpaynav \u2014 than \" magnificent \" in the vulgar sense."], [310, "262 THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. chap. v. which wasted itself on needless and distant expeditions while no effective resistance was made to the enemy at the gates. \u00c6thelred's reign of thirty-eight years displays little but the neglect of every kingly duty, little but weakness, impolicy, cowardice, blind trust in unworthy favourites and even in detected traitors. It is full of acts of injustice and cruelty, some of which are laid to the charge of the King himself, while others, if he did not himself order them, he at least did nothing to hinder or to punish. In that age almost every- thing in the history of a nation depended on the personal Import- character of its ruler. One great King could raise a personal kingdom to the highest point of prosperity; one weak or character King could plunge it into the lowest depths of degradation. So it was with England in the tenth century. The fabric of glory and dominion which was built up by the labours of \u00c6lfred, Eadward, \u00c6thelstan, Eadmund, and Eadred, the fabric which was firmly welded together by the strong and peaceful rule of Eadgar, now seems to fall to pieces at the first touch of a vigorous and determined enemy. And yet it was not wholly so. The work of so many conquerors and lawgivers from Ecgberht The Eng- onwards was not wholly fruitless. England passed into only ' *ne hands of a foreign master; but England passed into leaders his hands as a single king-dom, retaining- too her old worthy . \u00b0 . of the dominion over her vassal principalities. And it should not be forgotten how completely the whole evil was due to incompetent, cowardly, or traitorous leaders. The heart of the English people was still sound. Wherever a brave and honest man was in local command, local resistance was as vigorous as it could have been under \u00c6lfred himself. And in the last agony, when valour and wisdom seemed all too late, Eadmund, the glorious son of the wretched \u00c6thelred, stood forth like one of the old heroes of his house, to win back half the land from the invader, and to lose the rest far more through guile and treason than"], [311, "CHARACTER OF THE NATION. 263 through open warfare. The thing which is utterly inex- chap. v. plieable throughout the reigns both of \u00c6thelred and of Eadmund is the strange and incomprehensible treason of two or three Englishmen in high command. It is equally strange how their treachery could repeatedly paralyse the efforts of a whole nation, and how, after their repeated treasons, the traitors were again taken into favour and confidence by the princes whom they had betrayed. Our facts are minute and explicit; but we often need some explanation of their causes which is not forthcoming. A few of those private letters of which we have such abundance two or three centuries later would give us the key to many difficulties which chronicles, laws, and charters leave wholly insoluble. \u00a7 1.

Eadgar was succeeded by his eldest son Eadward, whose Death treacherous murder, though he did not die in any cause \u00b0. a gar' of religion or patriotism, gained him the surname of the Martyr. But he did not succeed without an interregnum, without a disputed election, or even without something approaching to a civil war. It shows how thoroughly we are now standing on the firm ground of contemporary history that we can recover a distinct portraiture of many of the actors in these scenes. The moment Eadgar was Movement dead, a reaction took place against the monastic party, which was met by as powerful a movement on their behalf. byf \u00c6lfhere, the Ealdorman of the Mercians and a kinsman Mercia ; of Eado-ar,1 headed the movement against the monks, and drove tbem out of several churches into which Eadgar's favour had introduced them.

More interesting how the crown. ever iQ a constitutional point of view than these eccle- siastical disputes is the controversy as to the succession to the crown. The election of a minor is in any case a thing to be noticed, and a dispute between two minors is more remarkable still.

But there was no son of Eadmund living ; indeed it is not clear that there was any male descendant of \u00c6lfred living. There were indeed men, like \u00c6thelweard the historian,5 who were 1 Fl.

At this moment there was no grown man among the immediate members of the royal family, and there was no one, either among strangers or among more distant kinsmen, who possessed that predo minant merit and predominant influence which marked out Harold for the crown ninety years later. The evils of a minority had therefore to be risked. Yet it seems strange that, if a minor King was to be accepted, there could be any doubt as to which minor was to be chosen. Eadward is said to have been distinctly recommended by his father, and with good reason. He was the elder son, and though primogeniture gave no positive right, yet it would surely be enough to turn the scale, even in a doubtful case, and this case, one would have thought, was not doubtful. The election of Eadward would have the unspeakable gain of bringing the minority to an end six years sooner than the election of his brother. Yet we read on good autho rity * that there was a distinct division of sentiment among the electors, and that a strong party supported the child \u00c6thelred against the boy Eadward. In this we can hardly fail to see the influence of the widowed Lady \" \u00c6lfthryth, in alliance with one of the two parties in the state.

Oswulf, thus appointed by Eadred, ruled over all North 966. humberland, till Eadgar again divided the old kingdoms of Berniciaand Deira, giving the northern province to Oswulf and the southern to Oslac.3 On Oslac's banishment, the whole seems to have been again united under Waltheof, who was probably of the family of Oswulf, and of whose own descendents we shall often hear again \u00a7 2.

Swegen, baptized in his infancy, and held at the font by an Imperial god-father, had received the name of Otto, as Guthrum received the name of \u00c6thel stan.2 But he cast away his new name and his new faith, and waged war against his Christian father on behalf of Thor and Odin.3 The life of Olaf, as told in the sagas of his country,4 is one of the most amazing either in histoiy or in romance. The posthumous child of a murdered King and a fugitive Queen, he is sold as a slave in Esthonia, he flourishes through court favour in Russia, he wins princi palities by marriage in Wendland and in England, and is converted to Christianity by an abbot in the Scilly Islands. The early life of Swegen is likewise connected by tradition with England ; he is said to have been driven from Denmark, to have sought for shelter in England, and, when repelled by \u00c6thelred, to have taken refuge for a time at the more hospitable court of Kenneth of Scotland.5 It is highly probable that Swegen took a part as a private wiking in the first three years of piracy, which chiefly laid waste the shores of Wessex and Kent.

The fight of Maldon is the only battle of the days of \u00c6thelred of which any minute details are preserved, and every detail throws light on something in the manners or the military tactics of the age. The battle took place near the town of Maldon, on the banks of the tidal river Panta, now called the Black water. The town lies on a hill; immediately at its base flows one branch of the river, while another, still crossed by a medi\u00e6val bridge, flows at a little distance to the north. The Danish ships seem to have lain in the branch nearest to the town, and their crews must have held the space between the two streams, while Brihtnoth came to the rescue from the north. He seems to have halted on the spot now marked by the church of Heybridge,1 having both streams between him and the town. He rode to the spot, but when he had drawn up his army in order, he alighted from his horse and took his place among his own household troops.2 These were men bound to him by the traditional tie of personal fidelity handed on from the earliest recorded days of the Teutonic race. Like Harold at Senlac, Brihtnoth fought on foot ; an English CHAP. V. were found in a Latin prose chronicle a century or two later.

King or Ealdorman used his horse only to carry him to and from the field of battle ; in the actual combat the first in rank was bound to share every danger of his lowlier comrades.1 The wikings now sent a herald, offering to withdraw and go back to their ships, on payment of money to be assessed at their own discretion. Brihtnoth of course indignantly refused any such demand ; steel and not gold was the only metal that could judge between him and them. The two hosts now stood on the two sides of the water, a deep and narrow channel, which, as the tide was coming in, could not be at once crossed. The bridge, a still older predecessor doubtless of that which still re mains, was held, at Brihtnoth's order, by three champions whose exploit reminds us, like some other incidents of the battle, of one of the most famous tales in the poetical history of Rome. The dauntless three who kept the bridge at Maldon were Wulfstan the son of Ceola, \u00c6lf here, and Maccus, the name of which last champion may suggest some curious inquiries as to his origin.2 Till the tide turned, the two armies stood facing each other, eager CHAP.

The English stood, as at Senlac, in the array common to them and their enemies, a strong line, or rather wedge, of infantiy, forming a wall with their shields. As in the old Roman battles, the fight began with the hurling of the javelins, and was carried on in close combat with the broadsword.2 Brihtnoth was wounded early in the battle, and his sister's son Wulfm\u00e6r was dis abled. But the brave old chief went on fighting, and, after slaying several wikings with his own hand, he was cut down, and two gallant followers who fought at his side were slain with him. One of these was another Wulfm\u00e6r, the young son of Wulfstan, who fought by his lord while his father was guarding the bridge. After the death of the valiant Ealdorman, the thoroughly Homeric character of the story comes out more strongly than ever.

Godric even added the further treason of mounting the horse on which Brihtnoth had ridden to the field, so that many thought that it was the Ealdorman himself who had fled.2 The English were thus thrown into confusion ; the fortress of shields was broken.3 The enemy had thus time to mangle the body of Brihtnoth, Faithful- and to carry off his head as a trophy.4 But the fight comitatus of was renewed by Brihtnoth's special comrades, whose names n tnot . anci eXp]0its are handed down to us in verses which breathe the true fire of the warlike minstrelsy common to Greek and Teuton.

This was Dunnere, a churl by birth, but whose rank is spoken of without the least shadow of contempt, and whose words and deeds placed him on a level with the noblest of his comrades.

Among the benefactors of the new house the Ealdor- man of the East-Saxons was one of the foremost. The first Abbot, whether from kindred or from accident, bore the same name as his benefactor the Ealdorman. He, according to the legend, died a martyr's death, through the practice of the Lady \u00c6lfthryth, the unworthy niece of the pious chieftain.1 The second Abbot \u00c6lfsige was bound to Brihtnoth by the tie of mutual benefits. He now hastened to the place of slaughter, and carried off the body of so great a benefactor of his house. The remains of Brihtnoth were buried in the newly hallowed minster, the humble forerunner of the most statelyand varied of England's cathedral churches. Under its mighty lantern the brave and pious Ealdorman slept in peace, till, under pretence of restoration, his bones were disturbed by the savages of the Gifts of his eighteenth century.

With the slight improvement of painting \u00c6lfthryth as a witch, it is the story of Joseph and Zuleikha, or of Bellerophontes and Anteia, over again, with such changes as were needed when the tale was transferred from a married woman to a widow. It should be remembered that \u00c6lfthryth's first husband \u00c6thelwold seems to have been a nephew of Brihtnoth. 2 Hist.

But the dastardly flight of the sons of Odda showed that England also contained men of another temper. And unhappily the policy of \u00c6thelred was now guided by men of the stamp of Godric, not by men of the stamp of Brihtnoth. The shameful payment of money, which the brave old Ealdor man had so indignantly refused, was the only means of safety which suggested itself to a King in the first vigour of youth and to his chief counsellors in Church and State.

But this plain lesson was one which \u00c6thelred and his advisers seemed never able to learn.

The first [990-994] ; act 0f this prelate was to drive out the secular priests from the metropolitan church, where Dunstan himself had let them abide.1 If Sigeric was at all versed in the fitting lore of his office, the history of the Old Testament might have supplied him with many precedents to show the fatal nature of his policy. No Jewish King had ever gained anything by buying off the Assyrian, and an English King was not likely to fare any better by buying off the Dane.

Each was, as it were, marked out by great public services to become the capital of the whole kingdom.

V. their duty to defend.1 Our narrative is thus far, on the whole, straightforward and intelligible ; but two difficult questions now present themselves. Were these Scandinavian invasions accom panied by any efforts on the part of the Celtic inhabitants of Britain to shake off the English supremacy? Was \u00c6thelred, while thus attacked by foreign invaders, him self engaged in foreign disputes and wars, perhaps in actual invasion of a foreign land? As far as the Welsh are concerned, it would be alike impossible and unprofit able to try to trace out every detail of the border warfare which was always going on along the Mercian frontier. The English Chronicles scarcely ever condescend to speak of the ups and downs of these endless skirmishes, while the Welsh Chronicles are full of them. They tell us of a good many incursions of the \" Saxons,\" but they are far fuller of the ravages of the \" Black Pagans,\" who were probably much oftener Northmen from Ireland and the Western Islands than actual Danes from Denmark. And it is small honour to the Emperor of all Britain that his plan of buying off the heathen ravagers had perhaps been forestalled by a vassal prince of Wales.2 This prince, Mere dydd, son of Owen, seems to have spread his dominion over the greater part of the modern principality,3 and in the year of the battle of Maldon we distinctly find Affairs of Wales.

One would be more anxious to know what was the posi tion of Scotland at this time. The reception of Swegen by Kenneth, if it be historical, might seem to point to an unfriendly feeling towards England ; but we have no notices of Scottish affairs till some years later. A more important question still now presents itself. \u00c6thelred's As far as we can gather from most imperfect and con- Nor tradictory accounts, it seems that it was during these mand.v years that the first direct intercourse between England and Normandy took place, and that that intercourse was of an unfriendly, if not a directly hostile, kind.3 The Disputes quarrel seems to have arisen out of the hospitable recep- rrom fDe tion which was given in the Norman ports to the piratical shelter, \u00b0 x \u00b1 given m fleets which were engaged in the plunder of England. Normandv The old connexion with Denmark, the good services which vessels. had been rendered by King Harold, were not forgotten in Normandy. The kind reception thus due to the Danes in general may have extended itself even to those who were in fact Harold's rebellious subjects, warring against the champion of the faith common to Normandy and England. The Norman havens lay most conveniently 1 He is called Owen, Guyn, and Etwin. Was this last name borrowed from the English Eadwine ?

A dis pute thus arose between \u00c6thelred and the Duke ; whether it led to open war is uncertain. At any rate it assumed importance enough to call for the intervention of the common father of Christendom. The reigning Pope, John the Fifteenth, stepped in to reconcile two Christian princes who were weakening one another in the presence of threat ening, if not triumphant, heathendom. A prelate named Leo, described as Bishop of Trier, was sent by the Pontiff to the court of \u00c6thelred on a message of peace. He thence went to Duke Richard at Rouen, accompanied by an English embassy, consisting of \u00c6thelsige, Bishop of Sherborne, and two thegns named Leofstan and \u00c6thel noth, who are no otherwise distinguished, but whose names are attached to many of the charters of the time. Peace was concluded on the terms that neither party should receive the enemies of the other, nor even each other's subjects, unless they were provided with passports from their own sovereign.2 CHAP.

They were no longer the plundering expeditions of private wikings, or of the sons of Kings spending their hot youth in this wild warfare against their neighbours. They were no longer the expeditions of adventurous chief tains seeking to better their fortunes by winning them selves new homes at the point of the sword. The two mightiest powers of the North were now joined together in a momentary league to compass the utter subjugation of England. Instead of the sea-rovers of a few years back, the invaders are now two powerful Kings with royal fleets and armies at their disposal. Olaf, King of the Norwe gians, and Swegen, King of the Danes, joined their forces in a greater expedition than any that Brihtnoth had ever met with steel or \u00c6thelred with gold. The pretext for war on the part of Olaf is not clear; Swegen gave out"], [336, "THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. 288 chap. v. that he came to revenge the inhospitable treatment which he had received from the King of the English in the days Attack on of his adversity.1 At the head of a fleet of ninety-four defeated ships, the two Kings of the North sailed up the Thames b.y tne and laid siege to London \u2014 the first, but not the last, siege CltlZcDS. 994- which the great city was to undergo in this fearful war- fare. For the first, but not for the last time, the valiant burghers, who had already learned to grapple with the Dane on his own element, beat back the invaders from their walls. The fire of twelve years back had doubtless been a mere passing blow; it could have done little to lessen the strength of the Roman rampart and of the tower of \u00c6lfred. But it was not only to such worldly bulwarks that the defenders of London trusted ; on that day the Mother of God, of her mild-heartedness, rescued the Christian city from its foes.2 An assault on the wall, coupled with an attempt to burn the town, was defeated with great slaughter of the besiegers, and the two Kings sailed away the same day in wrath and sorrow.3 Here was another triumph of English valour ; but in this reign valour and counsel were always local ; cowardice and utter incapacity reigned at head- quarters. Under \u00c6lfred or \u00c6thelstan, such a check as the invaders had met with before London would have been followed up by some crushing defeat, and the slain of Maldon would have been avenged in the glories of another Brunanburh. Under the wretched \u00c6thelred the very valour of the Londoners only led to the more fearful desolation of other parts of Ravages in the kingdom.

London and Essex might have been forgotten, but it was now clearly time to do something. But what was to be done ? \u00c6thelred and his Witan could think of nothing but their old wretched expedient. The invaders were again bought \u00c6thelred off; they were allowed to winter at Southampton; a tf^ UJS special tax was levied on Wessex to supply the crews with food and pay, and a general tax was levied on all England to raise the sum of sixteen thousand pounds as a pay ment to the two Kings.2 For once this policy, favoured by special circumstances, was partly successful. The union Embassy of of Denmark and Norway was broken, and one of the in- and\u00c6thel vading Kings was won over to lasting peace and neutrality. Q^f \u00b0 \u2022 Both the leaders of the heathen fleet were baptized men. Swegen indeed, the godson of C\u00e6sar, had denied his faith, and had waged war against his own father on behalf of heathendom. But the baptism of Olaf was more recent and more voluntary. His later history sets him before us as a zealous Christian, who evangelized his kingdom at the point of the sword, and who, in the name of the religion of mercy, paid back upon the heathen all that 1 It would, I imagine, be very hard to find out the exact point in Olaf Tryggvesson's life when, according to his Saga (c. xiii.), be made expeditions in Britain, Ireland, and Scotland, attacking the heathen and keeping peace with the Christians. It would be hardly more difficult to identify the daughter of an Irish King and widow of an English Ealdorman, whom Olaf marries in the next chapter. See above, p. 269. 2 I conceive this to be the distinction intended by Florence, when he says \" de tota West-Saxonia stippendium dabatur [\" and hi mon J\u0153r fedde geond eall Westseaxena rice,\" say the Chronicles] ; de tota vero Anglia tributum, quod erat xvi. millia librarum, dependebatur.\" VOL I.

A faith which shows itself in such works as these may indeed be far removed from the true spirit of the Gospel ; but such fiery zeal at least implies the firmest belief in the dogmas which it is ready to force upon all men at all hazards. We can then well understand that Olaf, already a Christian, might easily be led to repent of the wrongs which he was dealing out on a Christian land, whose sovereign and people had never wronged him. He willingly listened to an English embassy which came to win him over more completely to the side of his brethren in the faith. One of the ambassadors sent was \u00c6lfheah \u2014 the Alphege of hagiology \u2014 then the Bishop of the diocese in which Olaf was wintering, but who was some years later to ascend the metropolitan throne and to win the crown of martyrdom at the hands of the still heathen Danes.

One enemy was thus changed, if not into a friend, at Inaction of least into a neutral ; and the other, perhaps weakened by q94-I003. the conversion of his ally, seems to have remained com paratively inactive for several years. Of Swegen himself we hear nothing in English history for nine years, and when he did come again, he had a terrible reason for coming. The Danish fleet however stayed on the English coast, but for a while we hear of no further ravages. It would seem that the interval was partly employed in attacks both on the vassals and on the continental kinsmen of England. In the year of Olaf's departure, Swegen is said to have ravaged the Isle of Man,1 and there is no doubt that these years were a time in which both Danes and Swedes were busily employed in attacks on the land of the continental Saxons.2 In England this short respite was largely devoted to the work of legis lation, and to the carrying on of the ordinary business of government. Meetings of the Witan were frequent. More Meetings than one such took place during the year of Olaf's de- witena parture,3 a year of some importance in ecclesiastical history, jj\u21221 ' Archbishop Sigeric died, and the vacant office was given, \u00c6lfric by the election of the Witan assembled at Amesbury in Arch- Wiltshire,4 to the Bishop of the diocese in which they were 1 Ann.

Those of the same year at pp. 28 1 and 290, which \u00c6lfric signs as Archbishop elect, must belong to a later meeting, probably that at which he was elected. He was consecrated next year (Chron. and Fl. Wig.). Had he held the bishopric of Ramsbury without consecration ? 4 So the Chronicles, but only in the late Canterbury manuscript (Cott. TJ %"], [340, "THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. 292 met, \u00c6lfric of Ramsbury, a prelate whose name is still remembered as the author of various contributions to our early theological literature. In the same year also one of the greatest and most famous of English bishoprics found its permanent resting-place. The bishopric of Bernicia or Northern Northumberland, one originally planted by Scottish missionaries, had its first seat in the Holy Island of Lindisfarn, where, for a short time during the later part of the seventh century, the lonely see was made illustrious by the monastic virtues of its sixth Bishop Saint Cuthberht.1 He became the patron of the see, and his body was looked on as its choicest possession. In the great Danish invasion of the ninth century, the Bishop and his clerks fled from their island, and carried the body of the saint hither and thither, till it found a resting-place at Cunegaceaster or Chester-le-Street.2 Here the bishopric remained for more than a century, till, in the year which we have now reached, Ealdhun, the reigning prelate, re moved it once more to the site which his successors have kept ever since. This translation was not exactly a fore stalling of that general removal of bishoprics from smaller to more considerable towns, which we shall find carried out systematically soon after the Norman Conquest. Ealdhun removed his see to a spot which he was the first to make into a dwelling-place of men. As in after days the Wiltshire bishopric was translated from the hill of the elder Salisbury to the plain which has been covered by the younger, so, by an opposite process, Ealdhun now moved his chair from Cunegaceaster to a site nobler than that CHAP.

Saint Cuthberht and the episcopal throne of his successors were placed by the happy choice of Ealdhun on that height whence the abbey and castle of Durham still look down upon the river winding at their feet. He found the spot a wilderness ; 1 but a town soon grew up around the church ; Cunegaceaster was before long outstripped by Durham, and we shall in a few years see the new city acting as an impor tant military post. And as the city grew, its prelates grew also. In process of time the successors of Ealdhun came Greatness to surpass all their episcopal brethren in wealth and in j)0rai au temporal authority. The prelate of Durham became one, +n\u00b0roty off and the more important, of the only two English prelates Durham. whose worldly franchises invested them with some faint shadow of the sovereign powers enjoyed by the princely churchmen of the Empire. The Bishop of Ely in his island, the Bishop of Durham in his hill-fortress, held powers which no other English ecclesiastic was allowed to share. Aidan and Cuthberht had lived almost a hermit's life among their monks on their lonely island ; their suc cessors grew into the lords of a palatinate, in which it was not the peace of the King but the peace of the Bishop which the wrongdoer was, in legal language, held to have broken. The outward look of the city at once suggests its peculiar character. Durham alone among English cities, 1 Sim. Dun., Hist. Dun. iii. 2. \"Comitans sanctissimi patris Cuthberti corpus universus populus in Dunelmum, locum quidem natura munitum, sed non facile habitabilem invenit, quoniam densissima undique silva totum occupaverat.\" Compare the description of Durham given by W'illiam of Malmesbury, De Gest.

The translation of the see to Durham by Ealdhun is the turning-point in the history of that great bishopric. And it is something more; it is worthy of notice in the general history of England as laying the foundation of a state of things which in England remained exceptional, but which, had it gained a wider field, would have made a lasting change in the condition of the country. The spiritual Palatine of Durham and the temporal Palatine of Chester stood alone in the possession of their extraordinary franchises. The unity of the kingdom was therefore not seriously endangered by the existence of these isolated principalities, especially as the temporal palatinate so early became an apanage of the heir to the Crown. But had all bishoprics possessed the same rights as Durham, had all earldoms possessed the same rights as Chester, England could never have remained an united monarchy. It must have fallen in pieces in exactly the same way in which the Empire did, and from essentially the same cause. CHAP. V.

At an earlier rlji Gemot, held at Woodstock in an uncertain year, a code had been published,2 designed mainly for the purely English parts of the kingdom ; the labours of the Witan at Wantage, remarkable as it seems in a spot so purely Saxon, seem to have had a special reference to the country which had been occupied by the Danes.3 These laws, like so many other of our ancient codes, are chiefly devoted to the administration of justice and to the preservation of the peace. Neither in them nor in the earlier laws of Woodstock can we discern any distinct allusion to the special circum- stances of the times.

And it is clear that, to bring about such cientresist a state of things, there must have been causes which lay pac\u00aee*\u00b0 the deeper than the mere incapacity or carelessness of \u00c6thelred or than the treachery of a few chiefs of Danish descent.2 On the other hand, it is perfectly clear that there was no lack of zeal or courage on the part of the people in any part of the country where the invaders landed. This is shown by the valiant resistance which the invaders always met with whenever local power was in worthy hands. It is not unlikely that the forms of the English constitution of that day were partly in fault. The power of resistance was perhaps weakened by the very amount of freedom, general and local, which the English already enjoyed ; it was certainly weakened by the still very imperfect nature of the union which existed between the different parts of the kingdom. We have in our own times often heard General the complaint that a free government is less able than a acyon despotism to carry on a war with vigour. This charge is of consti refuted, if by nothing else, by the result of the great civil states. war in America. But the experiences of that civil war, 1861-5. and many experiences of our own, combine to show that a free country has greater difficulty than a despotism in the mere setting about of a war. No free state could expect to rival the readiness, vigour, and daring with which Prussia opened the wonderful campaign which made 1866. her the head of Germany. The very institutions which secure national, local, and personal freedom, sometimes form 1 See the Chronicles (followed by Florence) for the years 998 and 999.

The old free institutions of England threw diffi culties in the way of national resistance, difficulties which the genius of \u00c6lfred, his son, or his grandson, would have overcome, but which were utterly overwhelming to \u00c6thelred and his advisers. Most likely too, while the kingdom was still so imperfectly united, one part of the country did not greatly care for the misfortunes of another. The devastation of Kent and Wessex would not cause any very deep sorrow or alarm to the Danish people of Northumber land. Local resistance was always possible. A valiant Ealdorman might, with comparative ease, get together his own personal following and the able-bodied men of his shire. But even this process took time. While the English were arming, the Danes were plundering ; and when a battle took place, the Danish force, which a general national movement would have crushed at once, commonly proved too strong for the array of any one district. A general national resistance was of course still more necessarily a work of time. The King had no standing army; he could at all times demand the services of his personal following, but even they could not be assembled in a moment ; and no real national step could be taken, no national army or fleet could be brought together, no money could be gathered or expended, without the consent of the Witan. And when the Witan met, we can well understand that personal jealousies and still more local jealousies, to say nothing of the causes which always affect all assemblies, would often hinder, or at least delay, the adoption of any vigorous resolution. And when the Witan had passed their vote, they had to go back to their shires and hundreds to an nounce the determinations of the national council,1 and to gather together the forces of their several districts.

Under \u00c6thelred nothing was done ; or, more truly, throughout his whole reign he left undone those things which he ought to have done, and he did those things which he ought not to have done. For the fault of \u00c6thelred, after all, was not mere Character i -,r- i -i -ii- of\u00c6thel weakness.1 The Unready King showed occasional glimpses red; vigor of vigour which might for a moment remind men that he came of the same stock as Eadward the Unconquered and wrong -r. \u25a0 l-l P'ace as \u00c6thelstan the Glorious. But it was a vigour which came only by fits and starts, and which acted only at unfitting times and for unfitting objects. As far as we can judge by his actions, the character of \u00c6thelred was not one of mere abject incapacity like Edward of Caernarvon. He was rather like Richard of Bourdeaux, idle, careless, 1 Compare on this head a remarkable passage of William of Malmesbury, ii. 165. \" Verumtamen multa mihi cogitanti mirum videtur cur homo, ut a majoribus accepimus, neque multum fatuus, neque nimis ignavus, in tarn tristi pallore tot calamitatum vitam consumpserit. Cujus rei caussam si quis me interroget, non facile respondeam ; nisi dncum defectionem, ex superbia regis prodeuntem.\" This hardly goes to the root of the matter ; but William's perplexity clearly shows that the traditional character of \u00c6thelred did not paint him as a mere idiot, but as a man with the capacity, though only the bare capacity, for better things. See also Palgrave's Hist. of England and Normandy, iii. 103."], [348, "300 THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. governed by worthless favourites, but showing ever and anon, though always in the wrong place, signs of a strong will and a capacity for vigorous action. So now it was at this memorable crisis of his kingdom. He had at last got together a fleet and an army, and, having got them together, he would do something with them. But the Danes were gone ; they had got together their plunder, and had sailed away, as before, to sell it in the Norman havens.1 \u00c6thelred took advantage of their absence to plunge into a needless war with one of his own vassals. It does not seem that, up to this time, he had ever once thought of going forth in person to battle against the Danes; but the Emperor of Britain could trust no one but himself to lead an army against the Under-king of Cumberland. He ravaged nearly the whole of the prin cipality by land, and he would have ravaged it by sea also, only the fleet which set out from Chester was hindered by contrary winds from meeting him at the appointed spot.2 It did however reach Man, and harried the island. The cause of all this untimely activity is not stated by our best English authorities. Man especially, which had been harried by Swegen only a few years before,3 must have been singularly unlucky if it contrived thus to provoke the wrath of both the contending Kings. Nor is it at all clear why Malcolm was attacked in his under-kingdom of Cumberland.

In short he wished chap. v. to make the dependent kingdom of Cumberland liable, like an English shire, to the impost of Danegeld. Malcolm, we are told, answered with proper spirit. If King \u00c6thelred went forth to battle, he was ready, as in duty bound, to follow his over-lord with his own forces ; but he had never covenanted to pay money, and no money would he pay. The authority for this story is not of the first order ; but it falls in so exactly with the relations between the two princes that it has strong internal likelihood in its favour. Malcolm was not an English Ealdorman, ruling an integral part of the English realm ; he was a vassal prince reigning over a dependent kingdom, a kingdom which formed a part of the English Empire, but which had never been under the direct rule of the English crown. That king dom Malcolm held on the terms on which it had been originally granted to his predecessor, those of military service by land and sea.1 A. money tribute had indeed been levied on some of the Welsh princes; but military service was clearly the only contribution which a King of Cumberland owed to the Emperor of Britain. But \u00c6thelred was enraged at his refusal, which, he alleged, could proceed from nothing but good will to the enemy. He accordingly ravaged the country, but afterwards concluded peace with Malcolm. If this story be true, Malcolm was fully justified in his refusal, and the con duct of \u00c6thelred was a gross breach of the mutual duty of lord and vassal. It is also likely that this untimely activity on the part Second of \u00c6thelred led him also to match himself against an with Nor. enemy of a very different kind from the vassal King of \u2122a0^dy' Cumberland.

Of the dealings be- tween the two countries we have no account from any English authority, and the version which we find in the Norman writers, though doubtless containing some germs \u00c6thelred's of truth, is evidently exaggerated in detail. According to oTnot-1 them \u00c6thelred sent a fleet into Normandy, with orders mandy, as \u00a30 hum and destroy throughout the land, and to spare by Norman nothing except the Mount of Saint Michael with its revered sanctuary. As for the reigning Duke, he was to be taken prisoner, and to be brought into the presence of his conqueror with his hands tied behind his back. The English fleet crossed the Channel, and its crews landed in the peninsula of Coutances and began to carry out the Defeat of royal orders. But Neal, the valiant Viscount of the lish. ng\" district, gathered the men of the country, and smote the invaders with such a slaughter that of those who actually landed one man only escaped to the ships. The fleet sailed home with the news of its discomfiture. \u00c6thelred is pictured as waiting for the triumphant return of his fleet with the news of the conquest of Normandy. His first inquiry is for the captive Duke. But instead of seeing Richard with his hands tied behind him, he only hears that his men have not so much as seen the Duke, that the men of one county had been enough to destroy all their host, that the very women had joined in the strife, striking down the choicest warriors of England with the staves on which they bore their waterpots. These details are of course pure romance; but the existence of such a story seems to show that some hostilities really did take place. \u00c6thelred's fleet may have pursued the Danish fleet 1 See Appendix EE."], [351, "INVASION OF NORMANDY. 303 when it sailed to Normandy, and in so doing it may in chap. v. some way have violated the neutrality of the Norman Probable J explana coast. Or \u00c6thelred, in his present fit of energy, may tion of the have been so indignant at the reception of the Danes in s 0I7' the Norman havens as to send out an expedition by way of reprisal. But the grotesque pride and folly implied in the Norman story is incredible even in \u00c6thelred. The details are valuable only as showing the kind of tales which, as we shall see more fully as we go on, the Norman writers thought good to pass off as the English history of the time. Whatever was the exact nature of the mutual wrongs Marriage now done to each other by Normans and Englishmen, the red and \" quarrel did not last long. \u00c6thelred seems now to have Emma ; lts. 1 \u00b0 evil re been a widower ;J the peace between the two countries was suits. therefore confirmed by a marriage between him and the Duke's sister Emma, one of the legitimated children of Richard the Fearless and Gunnor.2 Her beauty and accomplishments are highly extolled, but her long con- 1002-1051. nexion with England, as the wife of two Kings and the mother of two others, brought with it nothing but present evil, and led to the future overthrow of the English king- dom and nation.

Through 1 See Appendix SS. 2 See above, p. 253. 3 On this marriage and its results see the opening of the sixth book of Henry of Huntingdon. He clearly sees the connexion of events, and he as clearly believes that William's kindred with Emma gave him some right to the English crown. \" Ex hac conjunctione regis Anglorum et fili\u00e6 ducis Normannorum, Angliam juste, secundum jus gentium, Normanni et calum niati sunt et adepti sunt.\" This is perhaps the strangest theory of inter national law on record."], [352, "THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. 304 Emma came that fatal kindred and friendship between her English son and her Norman great-nephew, which suggested and rendered possible the enterprise which seated her great-nephew on the throne of England. From the moment of this marriage, English and Norman history are inextricably connected, and Norman ingenuity was ever ready to take any advantage that offered itself for strengthening the foreign influence in England. The former dispute between \u00c6thelred and the elder Richard was a mere prologue ; we have now reached the first act of the drama. If an English fleet really did sail to Nor mandy and ravage the Constantine peninsula, those ships were like the ships which Athens sent across the \u00c6g\u00e6an at the bidding of Aristagoras \u2014 they were indeed the beginning of evils.1 CHAP. V. The marriage however did not take place for two years. According to one story \u00c6thelred went over to Normandy to bring home his bride in person.2 The evidence is distinctly the other way; but to go on such an errand, when the miseries of war were at their height, was per haps in character with a prince so apt to be enterprising at the wrong moment. A like piece of vigorous courtship is the one act of energy recorded of one of \u00c6thelred's de scendants, James, Sixth of Scotland and First of England. If \u00c6thelred really did go over to Normandy, he was the first English King, since \u00c6lfred in his childhood, who set foot on the continent, as his son Eadmund was the last Emma comes to England. 1002. 1589. 1 Herod, v. 97. avrai 0% al vtts apx^l Kanatv fyevoVTouE\\Krj(ji T\u20ac Kal LSapPapoiai. 2 No writer mentions this but Geoffrey Gaimar (4126.

The marriage of the daugh ters of English Kings with foreign princes had been common from the days of \u00c6lfred onwards ; but a foreign Lady by the side of an English King had not been seen since \u00c6thelwulf brought home the young daughter of 855.

The foreign marriage of \u00c6thelred paved the way for the more thorough fusion of England into the general European system, by giving her a foreign King, a foreign nobility, and, for many purposes, a foreign tongue. It shows the strong insular feeling of the nation, Emma and it curiously illustrates the history of English personal ner name nomenclature, that the foreign Lady had to take an Eng- to \u00c6lfSlfu lish name. The English stock of personal names, though made out of the same elements as the names used by other Teutonic nations, contained but few which were common to England and to the continent.4 This Old-English nomenclature, with the exception of a few specially royal and saintly names, has gone so utterly out of use that it sounds strange to us to read that the Lady, to make 1 I cannot answer positively for Harold the son of Cnut, but we shall come across evidence which makes it probable that he visited Den mark. 2 Chron. 855, and Florence (after Asser) more at length.

And it is well to mark that the royal bride, like other Teutonic brides, had her morning-gift, a gift which took the form of cities and governments, and a gift which brought no good to England.2 And according to some accounts, the marriage brought with it as little of do mestic happiness as of public advantage. Emma bore to \u00c6thelred two sons, \u00c6lfred, who perished miserably in an attempt on the English crown, and Eadward, who lived to be at once King and saint, and to be, perhaps through his own grovelling superstition, the last male descendant of Cerdic and Ecgberht by whom that crown was actually worn.3 But we are told that the royal parents did not agree.

It would appear that, though the mass of the Danish fleet had sailed to Normandy, some of the ships must have stayed in their old quarters in the Danes in Solent. Some at least among the Danes had taken service service ; under the English King. Such was the case with Pallig, PaUlg' a Danish Earl, evidently of the highest distinction, as he was married to Gunhild, a sister of King Swegen himself.1 His wife, and probably himself, had embraced Christianity, and he had received large gifts from the King, both in Invasion of money and in land.

The details of the battle are unusually minute ; eighty one of the English were killed and a much greater number of the Danes ; but the Danes kept possession of the place of slaughter. Among the English dead were several men of rank,3 among them two \" high-reeves \" of the King \u2014 probably the Sheriffs of Hampshire and Sussex \u2014 \u00c6thel weard and Leofwine.4 The Danes then went westward, 1 Will.

But \u00c6thelstan, in the course of his Western wars, thought it good that so important a post should be left in no hands but such as he could wholly rely on.

The chief architectural ornament of the city had indeed no exist- ence. The cathedral church, so strange in its outline, Exeter so commanding in its position, did not yet crown the Bishop's height which, alone among the episcopal seats of Southern See- England, makes some pretensions to rival the temples built on high at Lincoln and at Durham, at Geneva and at Lausanne.

But the result of the resistance of Exeter was much the same as the result of the resistance of London. The city was saved, but, for that very reason,3 the ravages of the invaders fell with redoubled violence upon the surround ing country. \u00c6thelred was as unready as ever ; the host which had been prompt to ravage Cumberland and perhaps Normandy, was not at hand to aid any local efforts. The Danes spread themselves over the country, harrying, burn ing, killing, in their accustomed manner. The men of Somerset and Devonshire gathered their forces, and met the enemy at Pinhoe,4 not far from the rescued city. But the force of two shires was not enough for the purpose. The Danes had the advantage of numbers,5 and put the irregular English levies to flight. They then, as usual, took to themselves horses, and ravaged the country still more thoroughly and unsparingly than before. At last they went back to their ships with a vast booty, and sailed to their old quarters in the Isle of Wight. Thence they carried on their usual harryings, both in the island and on the coasts of Hampshire and Dorset, no man now daring to withstand them. CHAP. V.

Except that other means of destruction must have been intended, this sounds very like a forestalling of the Gunpowder Plot. The Danes were indeed thoroughly faithless, but an in tended general massacre of the whole Witenagemot when in full session, which the words seem to imply, is hardly credible. Another attack on London or Exeter, or a harrying of some district which was as yet untouched, would be much more likely. One cannot help suspecting that we have here a good deal of exaggeration, exaggera tion, I mean, not in the Chroniclers but in the reports spread abroad at the time by \u00c6thelred and his advisers. However this may be, the King, no doubt with the consent of the second (or third) Gemot of the year, ordered a general massacre of all the Danes in England, an order which could never have been carried into execution if it had not been supported by the general hatred of the whole nation. It is said that letters were secretly sent to all parts of the kingdom, ordering the bloody work to be done throughout the whole land on one day. The persons slain Probable extent of were most likely such among those Danes who had served the mas in the late invasions as had stayed in England on the faith saore of the treaty concluded in the spring. A general massacre of all persons of Danish descent throughout England is not to be thought of; such a massacre would have amounted 1 On the details of the massacre, see Appendix GG."], [364, "316 THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. chap. v. to the slaughter of a large part of the inhabitants of Northumberland and East-Anglia. There is nothing in the earliest account to imply that any but men were slaughtered, and, among the Danes, every man was a soldier, or rather a pirate. That such men were not slaughtered without resistance is not wonderful. One instance is incidentally recorded, how such Danes as were at Oxford, flying from their English destroyers, sought shelter in the minster of Saint Frithswyth, and how they defended themselves against all the people of the borough, until their assailants betook themselves to fire and burned the Danes along with the church and its records. This one piece of detail seems to be trust- worthy ; 1 but the tale began very early to get improved by all kinds of romantic additions. The slaughter of ac- tual enemies was not enough. We first hear of a massacre of Danish women ; then, among an infinite variety of horrors of all sorts, we come to a massacre of English women who had become wives or mistresses of Danes, and of the children who were the fruit of such unions. It is not likely that there were many Danish women to mas- sacre, and the notion of a general massacre of women most likely arose out of one particular case. That Gunhild, the Murder of wife of Pallig and sister of Swegen, was put to death is too probable, especially if it be true that she had given herself as a hostage for the good faith of her countrymen. The prince who blinded the son of \u00c6lfric to avenge his father's treason,2 and who afterwards took the father himself again into favour, was capable even of so cowardly and foolish a vengeance as this. The traitor Pallig, if he was caught, would doubtless be put to death, and that with perfect justice, unless he was personally included in the last treaty. And it may be that Gunhild had to behold the slaughter of her husband and her son, and that with her dying voice 1 See Appendix GG. 2 See above, p. 280."], [365, "INVASION OF SWEGEN. 317 she foretold the woes which her death would bring upon chap. v.

The next year Invasion King Swegen came again in person.1 He now had a real in p^un.11 injury; the blood of his sister and his countrymen might I003 have called for vengeance at the hands of a gentler and more forgiving prince. He did not land in any of those parts of the island where we should have most naturally looked for the opening of a campaign ; he began his attack in the region which had been the chief seat of warfare for years before. Most likely he knew well where the weakness of England lay. The Danish King sailed to Exeter be- Exeter, the city whose burghers had so gallantly repelled g^enbv the former attack. But the state of thing-s within the Hugh the \u00b0 French walls of the western capital was now sadly changed for man. the worse.

Hugh was either a coward or a traitor, most likely both. Exeter was stormed and plundered; the noble walls of King \u00c6thelstan were broken down from the east gate to the west, and the city was left defenceless.1 Swegen returned to his ships with a vast plunder, and then went on to the harrying of Wiltshire. The men of that shire and their neighbours of Hampshire were gathered together, ready and eager to meet the enemy in battle. The people were as sound at heart as they had been three years before, but they had no longer the same valiant leaders. The battle of \u00c6thelingadene seems to have fallen with special severity on the chief men, and we now find the force of these two shires in the last hands in which we should have looked to find them. The old traitor \u00c6lfric,2 who had done his best, eleven years before,3 to betray London to the enemy, who had himself been driven from the land, and whose innocent son had paid a cruel penalty for his offence, was now, through some unrecorded and inexplic able intrigue, again in royal favour, again in command of an English army, again trusted to oppose the very enemy with whom he had before traitorously leagued himself.

One wonders that some brave man, how ever unauthorized, did not seize the command by common consent;2 but the paltry trick was successful; the spirits of the English were broken, and they went away in sadness without a battle.3 In all this history, just as in Fluctua old Greek history,4 we are often surprised at the mere accidents on which the fate of battles depends, how much am0I1g non-pro one man's valour or cowardice or treason can bring about, sessional how much turns on the mood in which the soldiers find themselves at the moment of action. In this case the English are described as having come together with the utmost good will, and as being thoroughly eager to do their duty. Yet a transparent artifice at once paralyses them, and they become wholly incapable of action. We must remember that here, just as in Greece, we are dealing, not with professional soldiers, but with citizen soldiers ; we are dealing with times when every man was some- times a soldier, and when none but professed pirates were soldiers always. Such soldiers are not mere machines in the hand of a master of the game ; they do not simply do their professional duty in blind obedience; they have a real part and interest in what is going on ; they are therefore liable to be affected by the ordinary feelings of men in a way in which professional soldiers are much less 1 Chron. 1003. \" pa gebr\u00e6d he hine seocne, and ongan he hine brecan to spiwenne, and cwavS p\u00e6t he gesicled w\u00e6re.\" 2 Like Lydiadas at Ladokeia and Philopoimen at Sellasia.

Such men are specially liable to fluc tuations of the spirits; they are easily encouraged and easily disheartened; men who fight like heroes one day may be overcome by a sudden panic the next. Hence the extraordinary importance which, with troops of this kind, attaches to the personal exhortation and personal example of the general ; a chief who simply stands aloof and gives orders can never win a victory. The particular speech put into the mouth of a general before battle is no doubt commonly the invention of the historian ; but that generals found it needful to make such speeches, and that such speeches had a most important effect on the spirit and conduct of their armies, is clear in every history of this kind of warfare. No doubt even professional soldiers still remain men, and are liable to be in some degree affected in the same way; still habit and discipline make a great change ; an army in which each man is really fighting for his hearth and home is liable to these influences in a tenfold degree. Before long- we shall see England possessed of an army combining the merits of both systems, an army uniting discipline and patriotism; but as yet the country had no standing force, and had to depend solely on the enthusiasm and the sense of duty of the general levies of each particular district. In this case, the spirit of the men of Wiltshire and Hampshire was all that a leader could wish for ; if some brave man had stepped forward, had cut down the traitor \u00c6lfric, and had called on the English to follow him against the enemy, a battle would have been certain and a victory probable. But no man had the energy to do this ; there fore the base trick thoroughly succeeded, the spirit of the troops was damped, and the English host went away without striking a blow.

We shall now see the efforts of a single hero, boldly struggling against every difficulty, feebly backed by those who should have supported him, and winning, in a succession of defeats, a glory as pure as that of the most triumphant of conquerors. This man was Ulfcytel, who is said to have been a son-in-law of the King, and who was at this time Earl, or at least military commander, of the East-Angles.1 His name proclaims his Danish origin, but it was in him that England now found her stoutest cham pion in her hour of need. This next summer Swegen took his course towards a part of England which was largely peopled by men of his own race, to the old kingdom of Swegen Guthrum. His coming was sudden ; he sailed to the surprises , and burns mouth ot the Yare ; he pushed his way up the stream, and . orwic . stormed and burned the town which had arisen near the point of its junction with the Wensum, and which, at least in later times, has spread itself on both sides of the smaller History of river. Norwich was in East-Anglia what Exeter was in the Western shires. But the city itself could not boast of the same antiquity as the Damnonian Isca. The changes of the waters in that region had caused the British and Roman site to be forsaken ; the Icenian Venta survived only in the vague description of Caistor, a de scription common to it with many other Roman towns whose distinctive names have been forgotten. At some distance from the Roman site, where the hills slope down to the right bank of the Wensum, the East-Anglian Kings had reared one of those vast mounds which form so marked a feature in the Old-English system of defence, and had crowned it doubtless with a fortified dwelling.

The castle of Norwich became the stronghold of the earls of the house of Bigod, one of whom lived to wrest the final confirmation of the liberties of England 1297. from the hands of the great Edward himself. As at Exeter, as at Salisbury, the Norman castle had already a rude fore runner, but the Norman minster had none. The Bishop of Norwich the East- Angles still had his seat at Elmham. A two-fold b^w-* translation of the see towards the end of the century, first See to Thetford and then to Norwich, points out those two towns as being at this time the most considerable in the district, and we accordingly find them the principal ob jects of hostile attack. Norwich was now one of the.Tmport greatest seats of commerce in England ; the city had town been greatly favoured by several successive Kings, and it enjoyed the privilege of a mint. A place thus rich and Norwich flourishing was naturally marked as a prey by the in- Swegen. vaders, who harried and burned it, seemingly without re sistance. The blow was so sudden that even a guardian like Ulfcytel was unprepared. He now gathered together Ulfcytel the provincial council, the Witan of East-Anglia,1 whose witan of mention shows how much of independence the ancient \u00a3 Anglia kingdom still retained.

He at once gathered his forces together as secretly as he could, and sent a detachment to the coast to destroy the ships of the invaders. In this latter part of his scheme he wholly failed ; those whom he sent on that errand proved either cowardly or unfaithful. And, even with the force under his own command, he was unable to save Thetford. The town was entered by the Danes, who plundered it, stayed there one night, and in the morning set fire to, it and marched away towards their ships. But they were hardly clear of the burning town when Ulfcytel came upon them with his army. That army was comparatively small ; had the whole force of East-Anglia been there, so our authors tell us, never would the heathen men have got back to their ships. As it was, the Danes themselves said that they never met in all England with worse handplay than Ulfcytel brought upon them.2 It seems to have been a drawn battle. The Danes so far succeeded that they were able to accomplish their object of reaching their ships ; but the fighting was hard, and the slaughter great on both sides, and we do not hear of either side keeping the field.

This was Eadric, the son of \u00c6thelric,1 surnamed Streona, who is described as a man of low birth, of a shrewd intellect \u2014 which he used only to devise selfish and baleful schemes \u2014 of an elo- quent tongue \u2014 which he used only to persuade men to mis- chief \u2014 as proud, cruel, envious, and faithless. From elaborate pictures of this sort we instinctively make some deduc- tions ; still the character of Eadric is written plainly enough in his recorded crimes. That such a man should rise to power was the greatest of evils for the nation; still his rise illustrates one good side of English society at the time. In England the poor and ignoble still could rise ; on the continent they had nearly lost all chance. Eadric rose to rank and wealth by his personal talents, talents which no writer denies, though they all paint in strong colours the evil use which he made of them. And he really rose ; he did not merely, like many low-born favourites of other princes, exercise a secret influence over a weak master. He was advanced to the highest dignities of the realm ; he stood forth in the great council of the nation among the foremost of its chiefs; he commanded the armies of his sovereign ; and, what would most of all shock modern pre judices, he was allowed to mingle his blood with that of kings. Now, if a bad man could thus rise by evil arts, it clearly was not impossible that a good man might also rise in a worthier way. Instances of either kind were doubtless unusual ; the general feeling of the time was strongly aristocratic ; still there was no legal or even social hindrance to keep a man from rising out of utter obscurity to the highest places short of kingship. Eadric, like most favourites, seems to have made his way to power through the ruin of an earlier favourite. A man named Wulfgeat CHAP. V. Rise and character of Eadric.

Bu*: he clearly exercised some functions which clothed him with a good deal of power, for, among his other offences, unjust judgements are spoken of.1 Wulfgeat was now, doubtless through the influence of Eadric, deprived of all his offices, and his property was confiscated, a sentence which would seem to imply the authority of a Witena gemot. The sentence may have been a righteous one ; but at all events the degradation of Wulfgeat opened the way for the elevation of a worse man than himself. Wulfgeat is at least not described as an open traitor and murderer.

There Eadric received him as a familiar friend, entertained him for some days, and on the third or fourth day took him out to a hunting-party. While others were intent on the sport, the executioner of the town, one Godwine, surnamed Porthund,3 whom Eadric had won over by large gifts and promises, started forth from an ambush at a favourable moment and put the Earl to death.4 The sons of \u00c6lfhelm, 1 On Wulfgeat, see Appendix II. 2 See Appendix KK. 3 \" Id est Oppidi Canis,\" says Florence.

In tiie summer a new Danish invasion began, and there seems reason to believe that it took place at the same time as a Scottish inroad, which was perhaps planned in concert.1 It is now a long time since we have heard Death of of any disturbances on the part of Scotland proper. King . ' Kenneth, the faithful vassal of Eadgar, had died in Accession the year of the great invasion of Olaf and Swegen. But t'..im.a nls son Malcolm did not obtain quiet possession of the I0\u00b04- Scottish crown till ten years later. He was now, it would there than \u00c6lfhelm ? The teller of the tale might almost seem to have looked on Eadric as already Ealdorman of the Mercians, and as therefore naturally called on to receive his Northumbrian brother in one of the chief towns of his government. But for Florence to insert, like William of Malmesbury, a mere piece of a ballad without even the attraction of a miracle, is most unlikely. Florence, as I shall presently show, is not infallibl ', but few writers are less given to romance. I therefore accept the story, though I do not feel perfect confidence in it. 1 This story comes from a separate tract by Simeon of Durham on the Earls of the Northumbrians (X Scriptt. 79). By some strange confusion, it is there put under the year 979, the first year of \u00c6thelred. If it happened at all, it must have happened in this year, the only one which suits the position of the King, Bishop, and Earl spoken of. Ealdhun became Bishop in 990, and removed the see to Durham in 995. Malcolm began to reign in 1004 ; a Northumbrian earldom became vacant in 100\"). This fixes the date. The authority of Simeon is, I think, guaranty enough for the general truth of the story, and the silence of the Chronicles and Florence is not conclusive as to a Northumbrian matter. The story also derives some sort of confirmation from a passage of Fordun (Scot. Hist. iv. 39, p. 683, Gale), which is very vague and confused, but which at least implies warfare of some kind between Malcolm and Uhtred. \" Othredum itaque comitem Anglicum, sed Danis subditum, cujus inter eos simultatis exort\u00e6 caussam nescio, Cumbriam pr\u00e6dari conantem, receptis pr\u00e6dis, juxta Burgum bello diffkili superavit.\""], [377, "SCOTTISH INVASION REPELLED BY UHTRED. 329 seem, determined to revenge the wrong which he had chap. v. suffered at the hands of \u00c6thelred in the devastation of l1000-J Cumberland. He is said to have invaded Northumberland besieges and to have laid siege to Durham. The new seat of the Duillrim- Bernician bishopric 1 was growing into an important city, and it had already become an important military post. But the government of the country was in feeble hands. Waltheof,2 the reigning Earl, was old and dispirited, and, Cowardice instead of meeting the invaders, he shut himself up in yvaltheof King Ida's castle at Bamburgh. But he had a son, Uhtred, Victory of whose name we shall often meet in the history of the time, uhtred. and whose career is a strangely chequered one. When his father failed in his duty, he supplied his place, he gathered an army, rescued Durham, and gained a signal victory over the Scots.3 Towards the city which he thus saved Uhtred stood in a relation which we should have looked for rather in the eighteenth than in the tenth century. He was married to a daughter of Ealdhun, the Bishop who had just removed his see to Durham, and in the character of episcopal son-in-law he held large grants of episcopal lands. Uhtred's behaviour gained him the special savour He unites of \u00c6thelred, who \u2014 doubtless by the authority of one of Noltnum. the Gemots of this year \u2014 deposed Waltheof from his b,rla,n, x Earldoms. earldom, bestowed it on his son, and also added the earldom of Deira, now vacant by the murder of \u00c6lfhelm.4 Uhtred, thus exalted, seems to have had no further need His mar of episcopal leases ; for he sent the Bishop's daughter back to her father, honestly returning the estates which he had received with her. He then married the daughter of a rich 1 See p. 292. \" See Appendix KK. ' The heads of the handsomest of the slain Scots, with their long twisted hair, were exposed on the walls of Durham.

This he, unluckily for himself, failed to do, and this failure would seem to have set aside the second marriage also, as we presently find him receiving the hand of King \u00c6thel red's daughter \u00c6lfgifu.1 If all this is true \u2014 and the genealogical and local detail with which it is given seems to stamp it as true \u2014 the ties of marriage must have sat quite as lightly on a Northumbrian Earl as ever they did on a Norman Duke. The tale indeed suggests that even the daughters of Bishops, a class whom we should hardly have expected to find so familiarly spoken of after Dun stan's reforms, may have been sometimes married Danish fashion. But the fact that an Earl did not disdain the daughter of a rich citizen at once shows the importance which some even of the northern English cities \u2014 for either York or Durham must be meant \u2014 had already reached, and it also shows that no very broad line as yet separated the different classes of society in such matters. The story again marks the ferocious habits of the Danish parts of England. It seems the most natural thing in the world for a man on his marriage to undertake to kill his father in-law's enemy. We shall find that this engagement of Uhtred to kill Thurbrand was the beginning of a long series of crimes, of an hereditary deadly feud, which went on till after the Norman Conquest. CHAP, v.

The old causes were still at work, and the enemy, perhaps remembering the reception which they had met with at the hands of Ulfcytel, seem now to have avoided a battle.2 They plundered here and there, and went backwards and forwards to their ships, till, as winter approached, the English army dispersed, and the King returned to his old quarters at Shrewsbury. There is a vein of bitter sarcasm in the way in which the tale is told in the Chronicles. The writers keenly felt the incapacity of their rulers, and the degradation of their country.

They marched along the ridge till they reached the vast barrow which, under the corrupted form of Cuckamsley,1 still preserves the name of Cwichelm, one of the two West- Saxon Kings who first submitted to baptism. This was a spot where, in times of peace, the people of that inland shire had held their local assemblies, and some unknown seer had risked the prediction that, if the Danes ever got so far from the sea, they would never see their ships again. The falsehood of the prophecy was now shown. The Danes crossed the range of hills ; they marched down on the other side, and went on to the south. At Kennet, now Marlborough, an English force at last met them, but it was speedily put to flight. The Danes then turned homewards. They passed close by the gates of the royal city of Winchester, displaying in triumph to its inhabitants the spoils of the inland shires of Wessex, now become the defenceless prey of the sea-rovers.2 CHAP.

Of course nothing more than a respite was ever gained ; when the Danes had spent the money, they came again for more. And it would seem, from the example of Ulfcytel, that a respite could be as easily won by a manful, even if not perfectly successful, resistance. Still this payment did gain for the country a breathing-space at a time when a breathing space was absolutely needed. We hear nothing of any more invasions for two years, and there was at least an attempt made to spend the interval in useful legislation and in putting the country into a more efficient state of defence. \u00c6thelred and his favourites, as usual, spoiled everything ; but we need not attribute their cowardice and incapacity to all the Witan of England. As far as we can see, the schemes of the legislature were well con sidered ; a respite was needed in order to devise any scheme at all, and humiliating as it was to buy that respite, such a course may have been absolutely necessary."], [382, "334 THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. But in this reign everything was thwarted by executive misconduct. \u00c6thelred first laid on his Witan the neces sity of consenting to all this degradation, and he then frustrated their endeavours to make such degradation needless for the future. CHAP. V. Meanwhile the reigning favourite attained the height of his greatness. He was made Ealdorman of the Mercians,1 dishonouring the post once held by the glorious daughter of \u00c6lfred. It was most likely at this time that he re ceived the King's daughter Eadgyth in marriage. We have now to repeat the same comments which we made in the case of \u00c6lfric. That old enemy, after his last treason four years before, now vanishes from history, and his place as chief traitor is taken by Eadric. The history of Eadric from this moment is simply a catalogue of treasons as unintelligible as those of his predecessor. Why a man who had just risen to the highest pitch of greatness, son in-law of his sovereign and viceroy of an ancient kingdom, should immediately ally himself with the enemies of his King and country, is one of those facts which are utterly incomprehensible. But that it is a fact there is no good reason to doubt. Our best authorities for this period, the writers nearest to the time, those least given to exaggera tion or romantic embellishment, distinctly assert that it was so, and we have nothing but ingenious guesses on the other side.

The civil functions of the King and his Witan were in full activity during the two years of respite. The laws of \u00c6thelred form several distinct statutes or collec tions of clauses, most of which are without date ; but, of the few dated ordinances, one belongs to the former of 1 See Appendix II."], [383, "EADRIC EALDORMAN OF THE MERCIANS. 335 these two years, while another may, on internal evidence, chap. v. be safely set down as belonging to the same period. The Laws of former statute1 deals mainly with ecclesiastical matters, but it also contains provisions both of a moral and of a political kind. On these points however we get much more of general exhortations than of really specific enact ments. The whole reads like an act of penitence on the part of a repentant nation awakened by misfortune to a sense of national sins. Heathenism is to be cast out, an ordinance which shows what had been the effect of the Danish invasions. Such a precept would have been need less in the days of Ine or Offa. But now, not only were many heathen strangers settled in the land, but we may even believe that some native Englishmen may have fallen off to the worship of the gods who seemed to be the stronger. Some of the clauses are vague enough. All laws are to be just ; every man is to have his rights ; all men are to live in peace and friendship \u2014 excellent advice, no doubt, but hard to carry out in any time and place, and hardest of all when \u00c6thelred and Eadric were to be the chief administrators of the law. Punishments are to be mild ; death especially is to be sparingly inflicted ; Christian and innocent men are not to be sold out of the land, least of all to heathen purchasers.2 This last prohibition is Laws one which is constantly repeated in the legislation of this the slave age, showing at once how deeply the evil was felt, and ra e\" how little legislation could do to get rid of it. We must never forget that slavery was fully established throughout England, though the proportion of slaves varied greatly in 1 Thorp\u00bb, i. 304; Schmid, 220. 2 Cap. 2. \" And fires hlafordes ger\u00e6dnes and his witena is, ]>\u00e6t man criatene menn and unforworhte of earde ne sylle, ne huru on h\u00e6Sene leode, ac beorge man georne, p\u00e6t man pa sawla ne forfare, J)a Crist mid his agenum life gebohte.\" The same practice is forbidden in the Capitularies of Charles the Bald.

The slave class was recruited from two sources. Englishmen were reduced to slavery for various crimes by sentence of law, and the children of such slaves followed the condition of their fathers.1 Welsh captives taken in war formed another class, and the pro- portion of slaves to freemen was unusually large in the shires on the Welsh border. Slaves of both classes were freely sold to the Danes in Ireland, and the words of the statute seem to imply that the kidnapping of persons of free condition was not unknown.2 Both these practices our present statute endeavours to hinder. The same prohi- bition was re-enacted under Cnut,3 but the practice sur- vived all the laws aimed against it, and we shall see, as we go on, it was in full force a few years after the Norman Conquest. The intention in this enactment is as good as it could be ; but the enactment is vague, no definite penalty is attached to breaches of the law, and we are not surprised to hear that it had little practical effect. Some of the other precepts are even vaguer. We may sum up the whole by saying that all virtues are to be practised and all vices avoided ; all church-dues are to be regularly paid, and all festivals are to be regularly kept, especially the festival of the newest English saint, the martyred King Eadward.4 The whole is wound up with a pious and patriotic resolve of real and impressive solemnity.

We may indeed fairly suppose that both these statutes were more distinctly the work of the Witan, and less distinctly the work of the King, than in most other cases. The laws of \u00c6lfred were the work of the King, which he submitted to the Witan for their approval.2 So, we may be sure, was the case with the laws of the other great Kings who came after him. But we may well believe that the laws of \u00c6thelred were the work of \u00c6thelred only in the sense in which the Great Charter was the work of John. Both statutes breathe the 1 It is headed, \"Be Witena ger\u00e6dnessan.\" The statute begins, \"Bis sindon ]>a ger\u00e6dtiessa, )>e Engla r\u00e6d-gifan gecuran and gecw\u00e6dan, and geornlice l\u00e6rdan, ]>\u00e6t man scolde healdan.\" And many clauses begin, \" And witena ger\u00e6dnes is.\" Mr. Kemble (ii. 212) remarks, \" If it were not for one or two enactments referring to the safety of the royal person and the dignity of the crown, we might be almost tempted to imagine that the great councillors of state had met, during \u00c6Selred's flight from England, and passed these laws upon their own authority, without the King.\" This is possible, and even tempting, but on the whole I think they must belong to the years 1007-9. The great importance given to naval pre parations seems distinctly to refer them to this time.

They clearly sprang from the best elements of wisdom that the Great Council of the nation could still supply. They show a real desire to mend the ways of the nation, to make satisfaction to God and man for the past, and for the future to work manfully alike for national reformation and for the national defence. The whole tone is at once pious and patriotic ; and the piety is of a kind which, while it strictly enforces every ecclesiastical observance, by no means forgets the weightier matters of the law, judgement, mercy, and truth. In all this we can hardly fail to trace the hand of good Archbishop \u00c6lfheah. A fleet then was to be raised, a fleet such as guarded the The fleet land in the days of \u00c6lfred and Eadgar.

In those days land was of course taken as the only standard of property on which the assessment could be made. It does not appear that either individuals or districts were called on to make any contributions in money to the royal treasury. They were to contribute in kind, according to a scale laid down by the Witan, in the shape of ships, or of things needful for the ships or their crews. There can be no doubt that, in the reign of \u00c6thelred, this was a much wiser arrangement ; money which had to pass through the hands either of the King or of his favourite would most likely not have appeared again in the form of ships. The The practice was not one which was invented for the nonce, 1 See Appendix LL. Z 2"], [388, "340 THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. chap. v. There is evidence to show that a contribution of ships in 995-1005. kind was the ancient custom. In the will of Archbishop \u00c6lfric, which must of course have been drawn up a few years before this time, that prelate bequeaths a ship to his flock in Kent and another to his former flock in Wiltshire.1 This gift must have been intended to relieve the people of those shires from some part of their share in this doubtless heavy impost. It is hardly possible that the bequest can have any other object ; one can think of no other motive which could lead an Archbishop or any one else to leave The contri- a ship to a shire, especially to an inland shire. This evi made by dence seems to show that the contribution was made by shires. shires, that each shire had to furnish a certain number of ships according to its extent, the assessment on individuals or on smaller districts being doubtless settled in the Scir gemot. This was most likely the old and regular way of raising a fleet, the way in which the great fleets of \u00c6lfred This assess- and Eadgar had been raised. But this vote of King origin of \u00c6thelred's Witenagemot does not only look backward ; it shlp\" looks forward. There can be no doubt that, in this ancient money. way of gathering together a fleet, we have the germ of the famous ship-money of the seventeenth century.2 The writs discovered by Noy calling on maritime, and some- times on inland, counties and places to furnish ships, and l634-5- the writs issued by Charles the First in pursuance of the precedents thus discovered, undoubtedly take their root in the statute of the thirtieth year of King \u00c6thelred. They are the degenerate successors of that great vote of the Witenagemot of 1008, just as that vote was the more lawful successor of earlier votes in the days of England's greatest Kings. There is of course one all-important difference between the two cases. The contributions levied 1 Cod.

But the impost was the same, though the authority by which it was raised was lawful in the one case and unlawful in the other. The earlier writs of ship-money under Charles demanded actual ships, just as in the case before us. And there was a call for special heed to the fleet in the days of Charles, just as much as there was in the days of \u00c6thelred. To say nothing of the general complications of Europe, the Alge rine corsairs, though not quite so formidable as Swegen's Danes, did serious damage to English commerce, and they sometimes actually landed and plundered on the English and Irish coasts. The objection was to the illegal shape in which the demand came. And the later writs, which, under pretence of a composition for the actual ships, levied a tax by royal authority over the whole country, were a further abuse. Money came into the King's clutches, not only without any lawful right, but without any kind of guaranty that it would be applied to the purposes for which it professed to be raised. This was the very evil against which the ancient mode of contributions in kind effectually guarded. Besides these vigorous preparations at home, there seems Embassy to Nor some reason to believe that an attempt was made at this mandy. time to strengthen England by foreign help. It was I0\u00b09 plainly felt that the peace bought from the Danes had secured only a breathing-space, that their attacks would soon begin again, and that it was necessary to employ the blessed interval in obtaining support from every possible quarter. It was not unnatural to hope that the marriage of Emma had gained for England a continental ally, and we are told, on secondary but not contemptible authority, that \u00c6thelred now sent to his brother-in-law Duke Richard,"], [390, "THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. 342 chap. v. asking for both help and counsel.1 There is nothing un- likely in the statement ; but, whatever may have been given by Richard in the way of counsel, it does not appear No Nor- that a single Norman ship or Norman soldier was sent to given. the help of England. Hugh, the betrayer of Exeter, is the only recorded contribution which either Norman chivalry or Norman churlhood made to the defence of our shores against the Dane. Nor indeed was there any strong reason why Richard should help his brother-in-law, unless he had taken up the cause as a kind of crusade, and had stepped in as a Christian champion against the heathen invaders. But Richard and his subjects were Normans before they were Christians, and all the traditions of Norman policy tended to fraternization with their Danish kinsmen. Such fraternization with the Danes had already caused, certainly a dispute, perhaps an open war, with England. Richard the Good in no way departed from this traditional policy. Richard's According to a Norman account, told with great confusion treaty with . Swegen. as to time, Richard was, either now or a few years later, actually bound by a treaty with Swegen, not only to re- ceive sick and wounded Danes in his dominions, but to allow the spoils of England to be sold in the Norman ports.2 This was the old ground of quarrel, but \u00c6thelred was just now not likely to retaliate by another invasion of the Cotentin. And, according to another story, told with equal confusion as to dates, Richard, like his father, did not scruple to accept the help of two heathen Kings of the North in his warfare with his Christian neighbours.3 At a later time indeed he could not well refuse shelter in 1 Hen. Hunt. M. H. B. 753 A. * Will. Gem. v. 7. But this writer makes Swegen sail to Northumber land immediately after the massacre in 1002, whereas he did not go thither till 1013.

There the ships were, enough and ready to guard the land against any foe.1 And, under \u00c6lfred or \u00c6thelstan, we may be sure that those ships would have kept the seas clear from every foe, or else they would have met the invaders face to face on their own element. But in the reign of \u00c6thelred domestic treason ruined everything. The fleet raised by such unparalleled efforts was doomed to do no more for England than any other preparations which had been made during this miserable reign. The fleet was ready, but there was discord among the commanders. Eadric, in his own rise, had raised along with himself several of his brothers,2 of one of whom, Brihtric, we read a character quite as bad as of Eadric himself. This man, at this time or a little Affair of earlier, brought unjust charges to the King, of what and Briht kind we are not told, against a leader named Wulfnoth, nc described as \"Child Wulfnoth the South-Saxon.\"3 Orders were given to seize Wulfnoth ; he fled, and persuaded the crews of twenty ships, most likely the contingent of his own shire, to flee with him. They presently began to plunder the whole south coast. Brihtric then followed him with eighty ships, thinking to win great fame,4 and to bring back Wulfnoth alive or dead. But a violent storm, such as had never before been known, beat his ships to pieces, 1 I here follow the words of the Chronicles almost literally. 2 See Appendix HH. 3 See Appendix MM. * Chron. \" And ])ohte l>\u00e6t he him micles wordes wyrcan s\u00e6olde.\""], [392, "344 THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. and dashed them against the shore, where presently Wulf noth came and burned them. A hundred ships were thus lost in one way or another ; but these must have been only a small portion of so great an armament. Yet an unac countable panic seized on all men. In the emphatic words of the Chronicles, \" When this was known to the other ships where the King was, how the others had fared, it was as if all were redeless ; and the King gat him home, and the Ealdormen and the High- Witan, and forsook the ships thus lightly; and the folk then that were in the ships took the ships eft to London, and let all the nation's toil thus lightly perish, and there was no victory the better that all Angle-kin had hoped for.\"1 CHAP.

The fleet was lost just when it was most needed. \u00c6thelred, Wulfnoth, and Brihtric had, among them, wrought the utter ruin of their country. As might have been looked for, and as evidently was looked for, the Danes, when they had spent their money, came again. First came a fleet commanded by an Earl Thurcytel or Thurkill, who plays a great part in the history for about twelve years to come.2 In the month of August this detachment was followed by a still larger one, under the command of Heming and Eglaf.3 The treason of Wulfnoth had left neither fleet nor army to withstand them. The two fleets met at Sandwich, whither their crews marched to Canter bury and assaulted the city.

They crossed the Chiltern hills, reached Oxford, and burned the town. They then turned back, as if intending another attack on London. They went on in two divisions, plundering on both sides of the Thames. But hearing that a force was gathered against them in London, the northern division crossed the river at Staines. They then marched through Surrey back to their ships, and passed Lent in repairing them.1 Progress In each of these campaigns, if plundering expeditions Danish 'n which no resistance is met with can be called campaigns, ravages. {he ravages of the Danes become wider and more fearful, spreading every year over some portion of the land which had hitherto remained untouched.

It was not till four years later, when it was too late, that the national spirit again awoke after the flight and return of April, \u00c6thelred. After Easter the Danish fleet sailed forth, and this time it attacked East-Anglia. They landed near Ulscytel's Ipswich, at a place called Ringmere. But there a hero batrie, at was waiting for them. In this reign however a hero was Rmgmere, commonly accompanied by a traitor to thwart his efforts.

There died \u00c6thelstan, a son-in-law of the King,2 the noble Thegn Oswig and his son, and Eadwig or Eadwine the brother of Eafic, whose murder was recorded eight years before.3 There too died Wulfric the son of Leofwine a man of the stamp of Brihtnoth, at once bountiful to ecclesiastical foundations and true to his country in the day of battle.4 Through his bounty the great monastery of Burton had been called into being six years earlier. But it is more to our purpose to note that, on the field of Ringmere, Wulfric, in noble contrast to the spirit which was so rife throughout the land, must have come as a volunteer, defending a part of the country which was not his immediate home. According to some accounts, he held the rank of Ealdorman in one of the shires of north western Mercia, and among his vast possessions, scattered over a large part of Mercia and southern Northumberland, we find none that could have given him any special personal interest in East-Anglian warfare. The Danes kept possession of the battle-field; they harried all East- Anglia for three weeks ; they burned Thetford and Cam bridge, and then, partly on horseback and partly in their ships, returned to the Thames. This second burning of Thetford, a town which had already been once burned six years before, shows, like so many other cases in these wars, the ease with which, when houses were almost wholly CHAP.

Such selfish- ness is at all times rife enough in the ordinary mind. In times of any local pestilence or other misfortune, the districts which are exempt are often inclined to hug themselves in their supposed safety, to be unwilling to take any active exertion for the relief of others, or even 1 \" Man,\" according to the familiar German idiom ; it is impossible to modernize the English without it, unless the whole force were to be lost. 2 Beafodman = Captain, like the German Hauptmann. 3 \" And ponne hi to scipon ferdon, bonne sceolde fyrd ut eft ongean p\u00e6t hi up woldan ; ponne ferde seo fyrd ham, and ponne hi w\u00e6ron be easton ponne heold man fyrde be westan, and ponne hi w\u00e6ron be sufian, bonne w\u00e6s ure fyrd be norftan. ponne bead man eallan witan to cynge, and man sceolde bonne r\u00e6dan hu man bisne eard werian sceolde.

And, in the times of which we speak, war of all kinds, a Danish invasion, a border war with the Welsh or the Scots, was a scourge at least not more out of the common way than a visitation of cholera or cattle-plague is now. That the Danes should be somewhere in the land had begun to be taken for granted. Each district had thus learned to think only of its own momentary safety, and to be careless about everything else. And this would be especially the case in a country, like England at that time, where the different parts of the kingdom were still very imperfectly welded together, where the habit of common action was still new and needed the strong arm of an able King thoroughly to enforce it. Even in this wretched year we may mark three stages of degradation. The first expedition met with real resistance, resistance which, had not Ulfcytel and Wulfric been betrayed by Thurcytel, would probably have been successful. In the second stage, though it does not appear that a blow was struck after the battle of Ringmere, yet there was at least the show of calling out troops against the enemy. But before the year was out we hear of a third Danish expedition, to which it would seem that not the least shadow of resistance was offered. At the end of November the enemy set forth again. They now struck deep into the heart of the country, going much further from their own ele ment than they had ever been before.

Northumberland and the western and northern shires of Mercia were still un touched ; and the western part of Wessex, which had suffered severely in former years, seems to have seen no enemy since Swegen's march from Exeter to Salisbury.

The price was, of course, again raised, and it now reached forty-eight thousand pounds. But such a sum was not at once forth coming, and it was not actually paid for a full year. This negotiation seems not to have gained for the country even that temporary repose which had been gained by earlier payments ; the delay of payment may even have provoked the enemy to fresh ravages.

It is a highly probable conjecture 2 that, just as in the case of Malcolm, the wrath of the English over-lord was aroused by a refusal on the part of the Welsh princes to contribute to the Danegeld. The expedition, at all events, made a deep impression on the Welsh, as it is the only warfare with England which their national chroniclers think worthy of record for many years before and afterwards.3 An English army entered South Wales, under the command of Eadric, who, as Ealdorman of the Mercians, would be the natural commander. With him was joined in command another Englishman, whose name is too hopelessly disfigured in the Welsh accounts to be recovered.4 They marched through 1 \"Ealle Jjas ungesealda us gelumpon purh unr\u0153des.\" Is there an allusion to the name of \u00c6thelred, and is this the origin of his nickname of Unready'1.

The Danes Canter- now again besieged Canterbury,1 and on the twentieth day Sent' 8- city was betrayed to them by a traitorous churchman, 101 1. one \u00c6lfm\u00e6r, whose life had been saved by Archbishop \u00c6lfheah on some unrecorded occasion. The Danes seem on this occasion to have been in an unusually merciful mood. This was most likely owing to the influence of Thurkill, who, if he had not already embraced Chris tianity, certainly did so soon afterwards. The most au thentic accounts distinctly exclude any general massacre, though the later narratives give us a harrowing picture of slaughter and torture, worked in doubtless from the stock accounts of Danish barbarities elsewhere. That the metropolitan church was sacked and burned is a matter of course for which we hardly need any evidence. The number of captives was untold ; the rich would doubtless be ransomed, and the rest sold for slaves. \u00c6lfm\u00e6r, the Abbot of Saint Augustine's, was, for some unexplained reason, allowed to escape.

At Deerhurst, at Bath, perhaps at Glastonbury, he strove after all monastic perfection. According to some reports, he was first Prior of one of the two great monasteries of Somerset, and after wards Abbot of the other.\" But it is more certain that Bishop of Win he was advanced to the bishopric of Winchester, by the cheater special favour of Dunstan, at a comparatively early age. 9 4- A few years before the present time he had, as we have Arch seen, been raised to the metropolitan throne. The Arch- canter bishop was now led away captive by the Danes. According bury' I0\u00b09' to the most trustworthy account, he at first promised them a ransom,3 in expectation of which they kept him seven months in their ships. Meanwhile, not only the ransom of \u00c6lfheah, but the general ransom of all England remained unpaid. The forty-eight thousand pounds, the price of the pretended peace, was still owing.

On the Saturday after Easter the Danes seem to have held some kind of festival, at which they got very drunk on wine lately brought from the south. This was no doubt one fruit of that commerce between the Danes and the Norman ports which Duke Richard and his people found so profitable. The Normans exchanged the wines of Aquitaine for the tribute-money or the slaves of England. The Danes in their drunkenness now called on \u00c6lfheah for the payment of the promised ransom. He refused ; he would pay nothing; he had sinned in promising to pay; no one should give anything for his life ; he offered him self to them to deal with him as they pleased. They then dragged the Archbishop to their husting or place of as sembly. Thurkill tried to save him, offering gold and silver, anything save his ship only, to save the holy man's life. But the rest would not hearken, and they began to pelt the Archbishop with stones, logs of wood, and the bones and skulls of oxen,1 the remains of their late feast. At last one Thrim, whom \u00c6lfheah had converted and whom he had confirmed the day before, moved by a feeling of pity, clave his head with his battle-axe. The conduct of the Danes both before and afterwards shows that this attack on the Archbishop was a mere sudden outbreak, caused half by drunkenness, half by wrath at the Archbishop's failure to make the promised payment. Thurkill had not been able to save the Archbishop's life, but it must have been owing to his influence, and to that of any other con verts whom \u00c6lfheah had made, that the body was allowed to be taken to London with all reverence. It was there received by two Bishops, \u00c6lfhun of London and Eadnoth of Dorchester, and was buried in Saint Paul's minster. CHAP. V. Murder of \u00c6lfheah. April 19th. 1012.

Anselm, on the ground that, though \u00c6lfheah did not die for any point of Christian, belief, yet he died for Christian justice and charity, as refusing to plunder his people in order to obtain a ransom for himself.1 \u00c6lfheah is not the only one in the list of our ancient martyrs whose technical claim to the honours of martyrdom may fairly be doubted. As in the case of the young King Eadward, the name was freely bestowed on any good man who died by an un righteous death. According to the most trustworthy narrative, \u00c6lfheah, however innocently, brought his death upon himself, by making a promise and then failing to perform it. Hagiographers have of course surrounded him with a halo of sanctity and miracle, and they have clearly exaggerated the evil deeds of his destroyers. But, putting all exaggerations aside, it is easy to see in \u00c6lfheah a thoroughly good and Christian man, one of those men of simple, straightforward, benevolent, earnestness, of whom the English Church in that age produced many. He was undoubtedly a saint, and it seems hard to refuse him the title of martyr. He had at least as good a right to it as many martyrs of earlier times, who brought on themselves a death which they might have avoided by provoking or challenging their heathen enemies. Soon after the Archbishop's murder, the forty-eight The money thousand pounds, the ransom of England, was paid, oaths Danes. were sworn, and the Danish fleet dispersed. But Thurkill, Thurkill whose whole conduct had shown a distinct leaning to English Christianity, now entered the English service.2 As we j!,r\u2122e' afterwards find him a zealous Christian, he was doubtless baptized now, if he had not been already baptized by 1 See vol. iv. p. 442. 2 On Thurkill's conduct, see Appendix NN.

Character Thurkill is a character of .much interest, as he in of Thurkill. many p0ints resembles, on a smaller scale, his wonderful countryman Cnut. He came to England on an errand of destruction, and he was gradually won over to be the stoutest defender of the land which he came to ravage. He was not a mere Pallig,1 to accept English wealth and honours, and then to go over to the enemy at the first opportunity. When he swore oaths to \u00c6thelred, he honestly devoted himself to the master whose bread he ate. He fought valiantly for England, and his ships for a while were the only refuge where the native King of the English could find shelter. If we find him at a later time once more on the Danish side, it was probably. not till death had set him free from all personal ties, to his first master, certainly not till English Ealdormen had set him the example of acknowledging the foreign King.

On the one hand, the country was thoroughly weakened and disheartened, and seemed to stand ready for him to take possession. On the other hand, as far as material help went, England had gained greatly by the accession of the valiant Thurkill and his followers. To chastise Thurkill, at least to guard against the possible consequences of his conduct, seems to have been the 1 See above, pp. 308-309."], [405, "SWEGENS LAST INVASION. 357 immediate occasion of Swegen's last and greatest invasion.1 chap. v. But this motive can have done little more than hasten a purpose which was already fully determined. Swegen had no doubt long resolved on the complete conquest of England ; but he may well have seen that Thurkill's new position rendered his own presence immediately necessary, lest his schemes should be supplanted by the establishment of a rival Danish dynasty in the country. However this may be, Swegen set forth, accompanied by his son Cnut, afterwards so famous, and reached England in July. The Magnifi- ccncfi of mngnificence of his fleet is described in the most glowing Swegen's colours.2 There is no doubt that, savages as they appear fleet' in warfare, the Northern nations of that age had made no small progress in many of the arts. The fact is fully proved by the antiquities of that time and of earlier times which still remain. And the adornment of the ships which were so dear to the heart of every Northern warrior3 was a favourite form of splendour.4 There may doubtless be some exaggeration, but there is also doubtless a certain measure of truth, in the account of Swegen's splendid fleet, of the birds and dragons on the tops of the masts which showed the way of the wind, of the figures of men and animals in gold, silver, and amber, which formed the signs of the ships, the lions, the bulls, the dolphins, and, what we should hardly have looked for, the centaurs. With this fleet, armed with the whole force of Denmark, Swegen crossed the sea, and came first to Sandwich. He then changed his course, and sailed to Swegen the mouth of the Humber, to a country among whose number.

The work of so many valiant Kings, of Eadward, of \u00c6thelstan, of Eadmund, was undone in a moment. The North of Eng land was again severed from the West-Saxon monarchy. The Danish King sailed up the Trent, he pitched his camp at Gainsborough, and all the country on the Danish side of Watling- street submitted without resistance. Embas sies came in from all parts of the North. The North humbrians first submitted under their Earl Uhtred, the King's son-in-law. We have seen him acting vigorously before,1 and we shall see him acting vigorously again ; but just now he did nothing to check the panic, even if he was not the first to be carried away by it.2 Next came the men of Lindesey, and, somewhat . later, the men of the Five Boroughs. The conquest of that famous confederacy had been reckoned among the most renowned exploits of Eadward and of Eadmund ; 3 but their mention now shows that they must still have kept up some measure of independ ence and of connexion wTith each other. Before long, all the population north-east of Watling-street had acknowledged Swegen. From all these districts he took hostages, whom he entrusted to his son Cnut, who was left in command of the fleet.

His character of the Londoners does not badly describe that of the English generally; \"Lau dandi prorsus viri, et quos Mars ipse collata non sperneret basta, si ducem habuissent.\" But the Londoners had a leader, only William throughout refuses to name any honourable act of Thurkill. 4 Florence ventures to say, \"\u00c6thelredus . . . muros viriliter defendit.\""], [408, "360 THE DANISH COjNQUEST OF ENGLAND. CHAP. v. brave Dane Thurkill was there, faithfully discharging the duties of his new service. For the fourth time during this reign, the invaders were beaten back from the walls of the great merchant city, the only resistance that Swegen seems to have met with during this fearful march. He then turned back into Wessex, first to Wallingford, then to Bath, destroying in his former fashion as he went. At Bath the terrible drama was brought to an end. \u00c6thelm\u00e6r, Ealdorman of Devonshire, with all the thegns of the West, came to him, submitted, and gave hostages. Putting the language of the different accounts together, there can be little doubt that this was, or professed to be, a formal act of the Witan of Wessex, deposing \u00c6thelred and raising Swegen to the throne. Northumberland had already acknowledged him ; and, considering that Swegen brought the contingents of the North of England with him, it is possible that there may have even been enough of the chief men of different parts of the kingdom present to give the assembly something like the air of a general Witenagemot. An election of Swegen was of course an election under duresse in its very harshest shape, and would in no way express the real wishes of the electors. But that some approach to the usual legal formalities were gone through seems implied in the significant way in which we are told that Swegen was now looked upon as \"full King\" by the whole people.1 Whether he was crowned is a much more doubtful matter ; the nominal religion of Swegen at this moment is a great problem, and we may doubt whether, if the apostate sought the Christian rite, any prelate would have been found to admit him to it. But that Swegen was acknowledged as King is perfectly plain. He now went northward to his fleet, seemingly for the purpose of attacking by sea the one city which still held out.

He makes \u00c6thelred fly secretly from London to Southampton, and thence to the Isle of Wight. He there holds a synod of Bishops and Abbots (see Appendix 00), makes a long speech to them, and sends Emma and the children across. Roger of Wendover tells the same story, only without mentioning the Bishops. William of Jumieges (v. 7) has a romance about \u00c6thelred bringing over some hidden treasures which he kept concealed at Winchester. He fancies that \u00c6thelred was living there, whereas the city was in the power of Swegen.

Of \u00c6thelred's sons by his first marriage, the gallant \u00c6thelings \u00c6thelstan and Eadwig and their glorious brother Eadmund, we hear nothing. As far as we can see, Swegen was the one acknowledged King over the whole realm. If the West-Saxon banner was anywhere displayed, it could have been only on the masts of Thurkill and his sea-rovers. During the whole winter, Swegen on his side, and Thurkill on his, levied contributions and ravaged the land at pleasure.2 \u00a7 5.

It was Swegen's conquest which made the conquests both of Cnut and of William possible. Cnut's conquest was of course only the completion of Swegen's. It was Swegen who conceived the idea, and who actually for the first time carried it out. That idea Distinction was something very different from anything which had Sweden's been set before the eyes of any earlier Scandinavian in- Conquest unci tn.6 vader. Hitherto England had been largely ravaged, and earlier had even been partly occupied. But mere ravages were invasions. in their own nature temporary; and the Danes who had settled in England had been gradually brought into a greater or less degree of submission to the English King, into a greater or less degree of amalgamation with the Eng lish people. The third stage of the Danish wars, that which had now for a moment accomplished its object, aimed at something of quite another kind. It sought, as I have before shown,1 not merely to ravage or even to occupy, but to transfer the crown of all England, the rule of all its inhabitants, English and Danish alike, into the hands of the King of all Denmark. This object Swegen had now accomplished. Succeeding events indeed called for the work to be done over again by his son Cnut. But the example was set ; the establishment of a foreign King in England, his willing or unwilling acknowledgement by the English nation, were things which had now become familiar. What Swegen had done Cnut might do, and what Cnut had clone William might do. Swegen now, Circum like William afterwards, was singularly favoured by for- favouTof\" tune. But the good luck of the two invaders took quite Swegen, different shapes. Swegen found an incapable prince on the throne, under whom no effective resistance was possible. He was thus able to wear out the strength and spirit of 1 See above, pp. 44, 162, 268."], [412, "364 THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. the nation by a series of successful, though partial, attacks. He was thus able, at the end of a long series of years, to obtain possession of the whole land without ever having put his forces to the risk of a decisive engagement. William found a hero on the throne ; he had therefore, at the very beginning, to stake all his chances on a single battle. But in that single battle England lost her hero, and with him she lost her hope. Swegen and William were thus equally lucky, but William ran a far more terrible hazard. Swegen is apt to be forgotten in a cursory view of English history, because he is over shadowed by the fame of his son. But Swegen was no ordinary man. If greatness consists in mere skill and stedfastness in carrying out an object, without regard to the moral character of that object, he may even be called a great man.1 His purpose was doubtless fixed from the beginning ; but he knew how to bide his time, how to mark and to seize his opportunities. Of that species of <jlory which is won by steady and skilful destruction of one's fellow-creatures, the glory of an Attila or a Buonaparte, the first Danish conqueror of England is entitled to a large share. Of the high and generous purposes which well nigh justify the ambition of Alex ander and of Charles, even of that higher craft of the ruler which goes some way to redeem the crimes of the Norman Conqueror, we see no trace in his career. He was so constantly occupied in aggressive warfare that he had hardly time to show himself as a beneficent prince, even in his native kingdom, and in England, if he had the will, he never had the opportunity, of showing himself in any light but that of a barbarian destroyer.

Early in the year after his conquest, February about the feast of Candlemas, he died at Gainsborough.3'1014' The Danish writers bear witness to the Christianity of his later years. During one of his seasons of adversity, His he was won back again to the faith from which he had re lsl0n' apostatized; he became a zealous believer, a founder of churches and bishoprics. But the German and English writers seem to know nothing of his piety or of his re conversion, unless indeed the denial of the claims of one particular Christian saint can be held to be evidence of Christian belief in general. That denial, we are told, Legend of was punished by a strange and horrible death. For such 0f swegen. an enemy as Swegen could hardly be allowed to go out of the world without some accompaniment of wonder and miracle. For once the discreetest of our Latin chroniclers opens his pages for the reception of a legend. Swegen, he tells us, had a special hatred for the martyred King Saint Eadmund, the famous victim of Danish cruelty 870. at an earlier time. He denied him all power and holiness ; he demanded a heavy tribute from his renowned minster ; he threatened, if it were not paid, to burn the town and the townsfolk, to destroy the minster, and to put the clergy2 to death by torture. All this is likely enough ; we can well believe that Swegen did thus threaten the church of Saint Eadmund, and that he died suddenly while preparing to set out to carry out his threats. The special reverence which Swegen's son Cnut showed to Saint Eadmund almost amounts to a proof that his father was held to have specially sinned against that martyr. Swegen had held an assembly of some kind which most likely 1 See Appendix QQ. 2 \" Clericos,\" says Florence ; for Saint Eadmund's was then held by secular priests. It was Cnut who first placed monks there."], [414, "THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. 366 chap. v. passed for a Witenagemot of his new realm .T He was on his horse, at the head of his army, seemingly on the point of beginning his march from Gainsborough to the threatened minster. He then saw, visible to his eyes only, the holy King of the East-Angles coming against him in full harness and wjth a spear in his hand. \" Help,\" he cried, \" fellow-soldiers, Saint Eadmund is coming to slay me.\" The saint then ran him through with his spear, and the tyrant fell from his horse, and died the same night in horrible torments.2 This is a legend of the simplest class. If Swegen died just as he was about to wreak his sacrilegious wrath on Saint Ead- mund 's minster, his sudden death would naturally be attributed to the vengeance of Saint Eadmund. The details of the legend are nothing more than a poetical way of expressing this supposed fact.

But, whatever was the immediate ground of censure, the expression is remark able, as illustrating a whole class of feelings which were peculiarly strong in that age, and which afterwards lost much of their power. Under our native Kings the Church Identifica and the nation were far more truly one than they were at church and any time after the Norman Conquest. The nation was'n\u00aeNa'!on J 1 before the deeply religious ; the Church was deeply national. The Norman same assemblies and tribunals dealt alike with ecclesiastical and with temporal affairs, without the least idea that either power had thrust itself into the proper province of the other.

Such is the general summary of the last recorded legislation of \u00c6thelred, conceived in exactly the same tone as the laws of earlier assemblies. The spirit which breathes in the decrees of the assembly breathes also in a remarkable specimen of the pious ora tory of the age, namely the famous address of Archbishop Wulfstan to the English nation.1 Somewhat of exaggera tion is always to be looked for in compositions of this kind, but, after making all allowances, we find a frightful \"Ac on bam gemotan, J)eah r\u00e6dlice wuriSan on naincuftan stowan, \u00e6fter Eadgares lif-dagum, Cristes lage wanodan, and cyninges lage lytledon.\" \" And }>a man getw\u00e6mde, p\u00e6t \u00e6r w\u00e6s gem\u00e6ne Criste and cyninge on woroldlicre steore, and a hit weor'o' pe wyrse for Gode and for worlde ; cume nu to bote, gif hit God wille.\" Cf. \u00a7 43, where the three Kings are named. 1 Printed in Hickes' Thesaurus, vol. i. pt. iii. p. 99.

Since the days of Eadgar everything had gone wrong ; sacrilege and unjust judgements, lust and rapine, the neglect of every natural and artificial tie, had stalked unpunished through the land. One King had been mur dered; another had been driven into banishment. The abuses of the slave-trade are specially noticed ; men even went so far as to sell their nearest kinsfolk. The English, in short, had become worse than the Britons whom they had conquered, even as the Britons were painted by their own Gildas. For all this the judgement of God had come upon the land ; the enemy wrought his will upon England without let or hindrance ; ten Englishmen would flee be fore one of the invaders ; the last excesses of cruelty and outrage had to be endured without resistance.

And for one moment the burst of patriotism reached even to the King.

But before they were ready, \u00c6thelred came up with his full force, and drove \u00c6thelred marches against Cnut and drives him out of Lindesey. 1 Northern tradition assigns to Olaf Haraldsson, afterwards Saint Olaf, a share in this campaign on the English side.

This prince seems to have been the third son of \u00c6thelred;1 one at least of his elder brothers seems to have died before him ; but, if he was not the eldest of the royal house by birth, he soon won for himself the first place by merit. A great Witenagemot was held this year at Oxford, a city whose renown as the seat of a great University belongs to later times, but which the whole course of these wars shows to have been already a place of considerable importance. Its importance however would seem to have been comparatively recent. The well-known legend of Saint Frithswyth 2 cannot be accepted as his torical ; but it may be taken as some presumption that Oxford had already become a habitation for man early in the eighth century. But there is no certain historical mention of the place till the early years of the tenth cen tury, when it appears as one of the chief acquisitions of Eadward the Elder. As it was a frontier town of Mercia and Wessex, we might have expected to find it playing a historic part in far earlier days ; but in those times the now utterly insignificant Bensington 3 seems to have been the chief military post of the frontier. So the now no less insignificant Dorchester was the ecclesiastical capital of a vast diocese, of which the diocese of Oxford, as it stood before recent changes, formed only a small portion. Oxford however was now a place of note ; in the new nomenclature of Mercia it had given its name to a shire ; and it must have derived some further importance from the presence of the minster which bore the name of the heroine of the local legend. That minster, after an unusual number of changes in its foundation, has at last settled down into the twofold office of the cathedral church of the modern diocese and CHAP. V.

In this year the town, so lately rebuilt after its burning, was the scene of an assembly which was evidently attended by a more than usually numerous body of the Wise Men.2 Eadric was now guilty of a crime of the same kind as that by which he destroyed Ealdorman \u00c6lfhelm at Shrewsbury nine 1007. years before. Among the assembled Witan were Sigeferth Murder of and Morkere, the sons of Earngrim, two of the chief ana Mor thegns in the Danish Confederacy of the Seven Boroughs.3 E^i/ These chiefs were invited by Eadric to his own quarters,4 where he slew them at a banquet. \u00c6thelred, if he had not ordered this villany, at any rate made himself an accessory after the fact ; he confiscated the property of the murdered thegns, and ordered Ealdgyth, the widow of Sigeferth, to be led as a prisoner to Malmesbury. All this would seem to imply some co-operation on the part of the Witan ; it may even imply some real guilt in 1 See above, p. 316, and Appendix GG, and the curious story recorded in the charter of \u00c6thelred, 995, in Cod.

When such things were done, we can understand that men may have thought the rule of the Dane at least not worse than the rule of such Ens'- lishmen. A gleam of romance now flashes across the Marriage dreary tale of crime and misfortune.1 The \u00c6theling mund and Eadmund had seen the fair widow of Sigeferth, and was Ealdgyth. smitf_en with a sudden passion for her. There was no time to be lost ; he followed her to her retreat and mar ried her against the will of his father.2 The marriage was not without political consequences. Eadmund seems to have looked upon himself, and to have been looked upon by his wife, as the lawful heir of her former husband. Possibly the wealth and dignities of Sigeferth, or some part of them, may have come through his marriage. At any rate Eadmund, at Ealdgyth's suggestion, demanded the lordships of Sigeferth from his father,3 and was re- His estab- fused. He then went to the P'ive Boroughs, took pos lishment or in the Five session of the estates of Sigeferth and Morkere, and AugusV received the submission of the men of the confederacy.4 1015. 1 The marriage of Eadmund and his establishment in the North are recorded by the Chronicles and by Florence, but more fully by WTilliam of Malmesbury. As his details in no way contradict, but in some degree explain, the account in the Chronicles, I do not scruple to follow him. 2 \"Visam concupivit, concupit\u00e6 communionem habuit,\"- says William. That the \"communio\" was a lawful marriage is clear from the distinct words of the Chronicles and from William's own words afterwards. The presence of Ealdgyth at Oxford suggests a question whether the Witan usually brought their wives with them to these assemblies. The question is not a frivolous one, as it bears on another, namely the time which meetings of this sort usually lasted. All the Chronicles speak of Eadmund's wife as Sigeferth's widow, and Florence gives her the name of Ealdgyth. But in the will of Wulfric (Cod. Dipl. vi. 149) we find an Ealdgyth wife of Morkere. Is there a mistake of any kind, or did the brothers marry wives bearing the same name ? 3 I speak vaguely, because William of Malmesbury surely goes too far when he speaks of \" comitatus Sigeferdi, qui apud Northanhimbros amplis simus erat.\" * Was this submission willing or unwilling ?

According to one ac count, the voyage was undertaken at the express sug gestion of Thurkill, who sailed to Denmark and there made his peace with Cnut.4 Thurkill was certainly on Cnut's side in the war of the next year; he may have thought himself absolved from his duty to \u00c6thelred by that prince's flight; but on the whole it is more likely that his change of sides happened later.

Or it may have been after \u00c6thelred's death and the election of Cnut by a large body of the English Witan.3 In the latter case, at all events, his allegiance to his old master was no longer binding ; the war between Cnut and Eadmund might seem to him a struggle between two candidates for the English crown, in which he, as a Dane, might honourably take the side of the candidate of his own nation.

But the old ill luck was at work ; the only thing that can be said is that \u00c6thelred was most likely dragged to the field from his death-bed.

These he made an excuse for disbanding the whole army and going back to London. Eadmund With such a King what could be done ? Eadmund with joln forces, drew to Northumberland, the government of his brother- in-law Uhtred.

But he armies. aQd Uhtred contented themselves with ravaging three Mercian shires which had refused to help them against the Danes,1 namely Staffordshire, Shropshire, and Cheshire. Cnut meanwhile went plundering on his side through the shires of Buckingham, Bedford, Huntingdon, North hampton, then by Stamford, through Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, on towards York. The ravaging of his country and the danger of his capital caused Uhtred to Northum- cease his own ravages and to hasten homewards.

The earldom of North- Eric made humberland was given by Cnut to a Dane named Erie, North who had married his sister Gytha, and had held the humbriaiis government of Norway under Swegen.2 But it seems that Eadwulf Cutel, the brother of the murdered Uhtred, either was allowed to hold Bernicia under the supremacy of Eric, or else succeeded to the whole when Eric was banished some years later. The whole North was thus lost ; it was again as thoroughly under Danish rule as it had been before the conquests of Eadward. And, worse still, Wessex was under Danish rule too, and it had even outrun North humberland in its submission. But London still held out; Cnut therefore hastened to subdue the last stronghold of the national life. Events had followed fast upon one another. Christmas had passed before Cnut crossed the \"Commendatis West- Saxonibus, et Merciorum parte quam subjecerat, ducibus suis, ipse in Northanhimbros profectus.\" London probably pro tected Essex. We hear nothing of East-Anglia, but see Appendix NN. 1 The murders of Uhtred and Thurcytel are mentioned in the Chronicles ; Florence adds the name of Thurbrand. The other details come from the tract of Simeon before quoted.

The throne was now again vacant ; England was at last set free from the worst and weakest of her native Kings. \u00c6thelred had misgoverned his kingdom till the rule of heathen invaders was felt to be at least not worse than his. He had been deposed and driven out; his kingdom had been reduced to the decks of a few hired Danish ships. He had been restored ; adversity had wrought no lasting reform ; he had thrown away every advantage, and his kingdom was again confined within the walls of London. That true-hearted city was once more the bulwark of England, the centre of every patriotic hope, the special object of every hostile attack. Beyond its walls, all was either actually in the hands of the invader or exposed to his power. The Witan of England, Bishops, Abbots, Ealdor- 1 The Chronicles seem to place Eadmund's departure for London after the submission of Uhtred, Florence places it before.

The assembly therefore passed him by; they chose \u2014 per haps they could hardly help choosing \u2014 the Conqueror; they hastened to Southampton, they abjured the whole house of \u00c6thelred, they swore oaths to Cnut and received oaths from him that he would be a good and faithful lord to them before God and before the world. It was per haps at this time that he received baptism or confirmation at the hands of \u00c6thelnoth the future Archbishop ; but he does not seem to have received the ecclesiastical rite of coronation.1 And even his election did not represent the voice of all England. We now meet with, what is so common in German, and so rare in English, history, a double election to the crown. Cnut was chosen at South hampton, but the citizens of London, with such of the other Witan as were within the city, held a counter Gemot \u2014 no doubt the earlier of the two in date \u2014 and with one voice2 elected the \u00c6theling Eadmund. His coronation at the hands of Archbishop Lyfing followed. The town which had been of late the usual place for the consecration of Kings, Kingston in Surrey, was pro bably in possession of the enemy; at all events the rite was done within the walls of the city, no doubt in the minster of Saint Paul, where the late King had just been 1 On all the points of the Double Election, see Appendix TT. 2 \" Unanimi consensu,\" says Florence."], [430, "382 THE DANISH CONQUEST OF ENGLAND. chap. v. buried. Whether Eadmund was the eldest surviving son of \u00c6thelred is uncertain ; x there could be no doubt as to short and his being the worthiest. Now, after the long and dreary reio-n of reign of his father, England had once more at her head Eadmund. a King 0f Men, a hero worthy to wield the sword of \u00c6lfred and \u00c6thelstan. The change came at once ; with her new King England received a new life ; after twenty- 988-1016. eight years of unutterable weakness and degradation, we now come to seven months of almost superhuman energy. Change We see that all that had been wanting through that long a single y and wretched time was a worthy leader; we see that, worthy without such a leader, the English people Were helpless ; we see that, under such a leader, even after all that they had gone through, they were still capable of exertions which, twenty or even ten years before, would have driven back the invaders for ever. Everything that could weaken and demoralize a people, everything that could thoroughly weigh down and dishearten them, had fallen on the English nation during the long misgovernment of \u00c6thel- red. A generation had grown up which had been used from its childhood to see invaders land and ravage at pleasure. They had seen the noblest local efforts thwarted by incompetence and treachery at head-quarters. They had seen a King and his counsellors incapable of any better device than that of buying off the heathen invader for a moment. They had seen the strength of the nation, while the enemy was preying on its vitals, wasted on distant, bootless, and unrighteous enterprises. They had seen the basest of traitors basking in the royal smiles, while the true and valiant defenders of their country were left unrewarded and unnoticed. Such had been the un- varied course of English history for eight and twenty years. But, even after all this, the heart of the English people still was sound. The wretched \u00c6thelred had ended 1 See Appendix SS."], [431, "REIGN OF EADMUND. 383 his days, and under his glorious son hope and courage chap. v. woke to life again. In the days of the father, one shire would no longer help another ; in the days of the son, the most distant parts of the land sent their contingents to the national armies of England. Those armies, instead of flying at the first blow, instead of disbanding before a blow was struck, could now face the enemy in pitched battle after pitched battle. The standard of England again waved over fields on which the English arms were often crowned with victory, and where defeat at least never was disgrace. Once only in the course of his long reign had \u00c6thelred dared to meet a Danish King in open fight. Now six great battles in seven months showed what Englishmen could still do under a King worthy of his people. The year of the battles of Eadmund is worthy to be placed alongside of the year of the battles of \u00c6lfred. 871. But the traitor still lived to thwart the noblest efforts of the hero; Eadric still remained the evil genius of the reign of Eadmund no less than of the reign of his father. Eadmund, surnamed Ironside,1 was now King in London ; Eadmund but Cnut, by virtue both of his election and of military iedged in possession, was King over at least the whole of Wessex, Wessex- Mercia, and Northumberland. The first act of Eadmund was to go forth from London to try to win back the im mediate realm of his forefathers, the kingdom of the West-Saxons. He was at once acknowledged, and English troops flocked to him from all quarters.2 Meanwhile the rival King, having received the homage of the Witan at 1 This surname is not only found in the Latin writers, but also in the poem in the Chronicles on the return of Eadmund's son Eadward in l\u00b057 ; \" Eadmund cing Irensid was geclypod For his snellscipe.\" 2 On the order of events in the war of Cnut and Eadmund, see Appendix V V."], [432, "384 THE DANISH CONQUEST OP ENGLAND. Southampton, continued his voyage towards London. He halted at Greenwich,1 and prepared to form the siege of the city. The course of the ships up the river was checked by the bridge \u2014 a wooden forerunner, no doubt, of that London bridge which lasted down to our own times, and which was no doubt made the most of as part of the defences of the city. But Cnut dug a deep ditch to the south of the river, so that the ships evaded the obstacle, and sailed round to the west side of the bridge.2 He then dug another ditch round that part of the city which was not washed by the Thames, so that London was again hemmed in on every side. But every attempt on the walls was again baffled by the valour of the citizens, and at last Cnut found it more to his interest to check the progress of his rival in the West than to go on with an undertaking which seemed utterly hopeless. He raised the siege, and marched after Eadmund. The English King was now collecting troops on the borders of the three shires of Somerset, Wiltshire, and Dorset. Cnut had followed so fast that Eadmund had had time to gather only a small force ; still he did not fear to meet the enemy in battle.3 The armies met at a point near CHAP.

I therefore, with Lappenberg (ii. 188), understand the story as I have told it in the text ; the phrase \"traxerunt \" (so in the Chronicles \" drogon \") seems to mean that the ships were towed along the new-made canal. 3 Flor.

The English wavered, and some were on the point of flight, when Eadmund, like William at Senlac, tore off his helmet, showed himself alive to his army, and hurled a spear at Eadric. He unluckily missed the traitor, and slew another soldier who was near him.1 The English then took heart again ; they attacked the Danes with still greater vigour, and kept up the battle till twilight, when the two hosts again separated. Neither side had gained any decided success; neither host, it would seem, kept possession of the place of slaughter. But if neither side could claim the formal honours of victory, the practical advantage was clearly on the side of the English.

They sailed away from London, they coasted along the shores of Essex ; they then entered the Orwell, and thence they marched across East-Anglia and spread themselves over Mercia, plundering, burning, slaying, according to their wont. Then, gorged with plunder, those who were on foot went back to their ships, and sailed up the Medway, the fierce and swift-flowing stream which washed the fair walls of Rochester.2 Those who had horses seemed to have reached the same trysting-place by land. But King Eadmund followed them with his fourth army, which must have been partly at least levied in Mercia, as he was Fifth now north of the Thames.

The traitor contrived to \u00b0 x J Danes from detain the King at Aylesford, and the Danish army was degtmo saved from utter destruction. The last act of this great drama was now drawing near. Since the end of April, Eadmund had gathered four armies ; he had fought five pitched battles ; he had been decidedly victorious in four of them, and he had, to say the least, not been decidedly defeated in any. Never had the efforts of one man been greater or more successful ; \u00c6lfred himself, in his most hard-sought cam paigns, had not worked for England with a truer heart than his valiant descendant. Eadmund again marched Eadmund westward, he gathered a fifth army, and made ready for gftQ arm a sixth battle. The war, which in the beginning might aU have almost passed for a local struggle, had now become thoroughly national. Cnut had now to fight, not against Wessex, but against England, and there is nothing which leads us to think that he now had any English followers under his banners. Eadmund's new host was gathered from all parts of England, even from districts whose inhabitants were largely of Danish origin. We have no complete list of the shires which sent contingents, but we incidentally find that men came from districts as far apart from each other as Herefordshire, East-Anglia, and Lindesey. The Danes meanwhile sailed along the coast of Essex, and entered the estuary of the Crouch.

Along these heights Eadmund followed them, and at last overtook and en gaged them in the sixth and last battle of this wonderful year, the memorable fight of Assandun.1 At the end of the range, two hills of slight positive height, but which seem lofty in the low lands of the East of England, look down on the swampy plain watered by the tidal river. Between the hills and this lowest ground lies a considerable level at an intermediate height, which seems to have been the actual site of the battle. Of the two hills one still keeps the name of Ashington, an easy corruption of the ancient form, while the other, in its name of Canewdon, perhaps preserves the memory of the Danish conqueror himself. On Assandun then, a site marked by entrenchments which are perhaps witnesses of that day's fight, perhaps of yet earlier warfare, Eadmund drew up his forces in three ranks, he made the speech usual before action, and at first seemed disposed to await the attack of the enemy.2 The King took the post which immemorial usage fixed for a royal general, between the two ensigns which were displayed over an English army, the golden Dragon, the national ensign of Wessex, and the Standard, seemingly the personal device of the King.3 But Cnut had no mind to attack ; most likely he CHAP.

At all events he had no mind to attack the English as long as they were posted on a spot where the ground gave them the advantage. Yet the moment was favourable for battle ; the Raven fluttered her wings, and Thurkill, overjoyed at the happy omen, called for immediate action.1 But Cnut, young as he was, was wary, and would fight only after his own fashion. He gradually led his troops off the hills into the level ground,2 that is, the intermediate height between the hills and the swampy plain. The main object of Eadmund was to cut off the Danes from their ships ; he had there fore no choice but to leave his strong post and to come down to the lower ground. This movement differed from that of those English troops at Senlac, who, in defiance of Harold's orders, left the hill to pursue the Normans in their real or pretended flight. At Senlac, in withstanding horsemen, the one thing to be done was to keep the strong post against all assaults ; at Assandun, English and Danes, using much the same tactics and the same weapons, could meet on equal terms on the level ground. If Eadmund gave up the advantage of his strong position for defence, he gained the advantage of the charge down hill for his attack. He accordingly began the battle with a furious First at- f ifk OT fri*-* assault upon the Danes ; he even forsook the royal post, English. and, charging sword in hand in the front rank, he burst like a thunderbolt upon the thickest of the enemy.3 The from Zealand, figures as aquilifer on the other side, when he surely ought to have been conifer. 1 The Danish Raven, according to the story, opened its mouth and fluttered its wings before a victory, but held its wings down before a defeat.

Danes held their ground manfully, and the fight was kept up with equal valour, and with frightful slaughter, on both sides. But on the whole the Danes had the worse, and they were beginning to give way, when Eadric again be trayed his lord and King and all the people of English kin.1 He was in command of the Mages\u00e6tas or men of Herefordshire and of the forces of some other parts of his old earldom ; at the head of these troops, according to a previous agreement with Cnut, the English Ealdorman, the brother-in-law of the King, took to flight.

We have seen that, in this age, Arch bishop \u00c6lfric not only bequeathed ships to his dioceses, but personally commanded fleets,1 and it may well be that the arm of Eadnoth, if not that of Wulfsige, was found as strong as those of Ealhstan in an earlier, and of Ealdred in a later, generation.2 At all events, whether they came to pray or to fight, the prelates met with no more mercy from the Danish sword than the lay chieftains. At last, under cover of night, the King and the remnant of his army escaped; Eadmund Ironside, for the first time in this year of battles, was a fugitive. The Danes hardly dared to pursue ; but they kept possession of the place of slaughter. They tarried on the field all night ; in the morning they buried their own dead ; they gathered the spoils of the slain English, and left their bodies to the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the land.3 They then went to their ships and sailed towards London,4 most likely meaning to begin the siege a fourth time. When they were gone, some of the scattered English ventured to return and carry off the bodies of the slain leaders. \u00c6thelweard and Wulf sige found an honourable grave in their own church at Ramsey; the body of Eadnoth lay in the rival minster of Ely, the resting-place of Brihtnoth.5 CHAP.

This remarkable slaughter of the nobility is em phatically pointed out in all our narratives,1 and it is not unlikely that it had a real political effect, like the cutting off of the medi\u00e6val baronage in the Wars of the Roses. But as a mere military success, Cnut's victory at Assandun does not seem to have been very decisive. At any rate, instead of being followed up by any vigorous blow, it led only to a conference and a compromise be tween the contending Kings. Neither the spirit nor Eadmund the resources of Eadmund were worn out. Indeed he for a seems to have been readier than his rival to try his fate ?eT?.nth J battle. once more in a seventh battle. As undaunted as ever, he made his way into Gloucestershire, and there began gathering recruits for a new campaign.2 He seems to have been actually ready with a fresh army, when Cnut, with his victorious host, came after him. But no battle took place. Eadric \u2014 still, strange to say, in the King's confidence \u2014 and the other Witan who were with him, the relics of Assandun, persuaded Eadmund, much against his will,3 to consent to a conference and a division of the kingdom. The two Kings drew near to the Severn from opposite sides, Eadmund from the west, Cnut from the claim of Ely. It is rather odd that the Ely historian mentions neither the miracles nor the burial of Eadnoth, but he goes on to say that the Ely monks went to the field with certain of the relics of their church, which were lost. Some, he says, said that Cnut carried them away and placed them at Canterbury. Such a pious robbery would be quite in harmony with Cnut's later character. 1 Fl.

They met in an island of the river, called Conference Olney,1 to which the Kings were, seemingly together with chosen witnesses,2 rowed over from their several banks of the river. The meeting was a friendly one ; we can well believe that two such valiant captains as Cnut and Eadmund might, in the course of their warfare, conceive a real respect for each other. But, among the many great qualities which Cnut, in after times, gradually developed out of his original barbarism, this particular virtue of generosity towards personal rivals is one of which we see few signs. Without imputing to Cnut any actual treachery, we may feel sure that in this, as in most other acts of his life, he was guided by policy rather than by sentiment. Still, from whatever motives, the two Kings treated one another with the utmost courtesy. Division A division of the kingdom was the essential principle of of the kingdom the treaty; the two Kings now agreed on details. They Eadmund se^tied the extent of their respective dominions, and and Cnut. a]s0 the amount of money which, as a necessary conse- quence of any treaty with Danes, was to be paid to the Danish fleet. They moreover swore oaths of friendship and brotherhood, and, like the heroes of Homer,3 they exchanged arms in token of mutual good will.4 The 1 On this conference between Eadmund and Cnut, and the process by which in most later accounts it has grown into a single combat between the rival Kings, see Appendix WW. 2 So I infer from the proceedings of Cnut after the death of Eadmund. 3 As Glaukos and Diomedes, 11. vi. 230 et seqq. ; Hektor and Aias, vii. 303.

It seems to exist among other Slaves as well, and we shall come across other cases in our own story. * \" Armis et vestibus mutatis,\" says Florence, but, if the tradition as to the personal stature of the two kings be correct, a judgement of Cyrus would have been presently needed to restore the clothes to their former owners."], [445, "DIVISION OF THE KINGDOM. 397 terms of the treaty, indeed the fact of Cnut's consenting to any treaty at all, show how formidable the power of Eadmund must still have seemed. The Imperial dignity remained to the English King, who, unlike his rival, was already a King in the fullest sense of the word, a King crowned and anointed. With this over-lordship of the whole realm, Eadmund kept the immediate do minion of all England south of the Thames, together with East-Anglia, Essex, and London. Cnut took the remainder, the larger portion of the kingdom. As com pared with the division between \u00c6lfred and Guthrum, the dominions of Eadmund were larger on one side and smaller on another. Eadmund gained Essex and East-Anglia, which, in the earlier division, fell to the lot of the Danes, while he lost the part of Mercia which was kept \u2014 or, more strictly, won back \u2014 by \u00c6lfred. It would seem that each prince was to succeed to the dominions of the other, at all events if he died childless. The brothers of the two Kings seem to have been for mally shut out. The sons of Eadmund were left in the usual position of minors. No immediate provision or stipulation was made for them; but their position as \u00c6thelings, entitled to a preference on any future vacancy, seems to have been distinctly acknowledged. It is hardly possible that a lasting separation of the two parts of the kingdom was seriously meant. Such a division could not have lasted longer than the joint lives of the two reconciled competitors, and it would probably have been annulled at no distant time by the first quarrel between them.1 CHAP.

But meanwhile a sudden event set aside all the late engagements and made Cnut master of the whole realm. 0 O On Saint Andrew's day King Eadmund Ironside died in London. The manner of his death is uncertain.1 Perhaps the overwhelming toil of the last seven months may have worn out the strength even of one whose vigorous frame had won him his distinctive surname. The personal exertions of Eadmund must in truth have been greater than those of any other man in the two armies. Besides actual marching and fighting, there was the going to and fro after each battle to gather fresh troops. This labour must have pressed more severely on Eadmund than on any one else, far more severely than on Cnut, who had his army always ready at hand. It is therefore quite possible in itself that the death of Eadmund was natural, and such a belief is in no way contradicted by our best authorities. But, according to a report which obtained a wide belief, he died by the hand, or at least by the practice, of Eadric. The traitor, or some kindred wretch in his employ, slew the King and brother whom he had so often betrayed, and that by a specially base and treacherous form of assas sination. That Cnut himself had a hand in the deed is an obvious surmise, and one which his conduct imme diately afterwards certainly does not belie. But no Eng lish authority hints at any such suspicion ; the only Death of Eadmund Ironside. November 30, 1016.

But whether the death of Eadmund was natural or violent, whether Cnut was or was not the instigator of the murder, if murder there was, he at least reaped all the advantage of the opportune end of his former rival and now sworn brother. The unbroken succession of the West-Saxon Kings, of the English Emperors of Britain, had now come to an end. The remains of the last, and one of the noblest, of that great line were carried to the common sanctuary of Briton and Englishman, and the body of Eadmund Ironside was laid by that of his grandfather Eadgar in the great minster of Glastonbury.1 In later Eadmund's times, through all the rebuildings of that wonderful Jj\u2122 t0* . pile, the memory of the hero of Sherstone and Assandun bury still lived. Till men arose in whose eyes art, history, and religion were alike worthless, he held a worthy place among a galaxy of royal tombs which Winchester or Westminster could hardly surpass.2 Behind the high altar, in his own chapel as a canonized saint, rested the body of Eadgar the Peaceful. Before the altar lay the supposed remains of the legendary Arthur and his yet more legendary Queen. North and south slept two champions of England, alike in name and in glory. On the north side lay Eadmund the Magnificent, one of the brother heroes of Brunanburh, the conqueror of Scot and Cumbrian and Northman, the deliverer of English cities from the heathen yoke. To the south lay his namesake 1 Chronn. \"His lie HS on Gl\u00e6stingabyrig mid his ealdan f\u00e6der Ead gare.\" 2 On the Glastonbury tombs, see Willis, Architectural History of Glas tonbury, p. 33.

Dipl. iii. 369) of \" Eadmundus \u00e6Seling rex,\" granting lands \" \u00e6t Pegecyrcan\" (Peakirk in Northamptonshire) to the New Minster at Winchester. Its style, less turgid than that of most Latin documents of the kind, may be characteristic either of the man or of the circumstances of the time. The time when Eadmund was most likely to exercise acts of sovereignty in Northamptonshire would be in the autumn of 1016, be tween the battles of Otford and Assandun, when he was drawing troops from Lindesey and other distant parts of the kingdom."], [449, "CHAPTER VI. THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND.1 IOI7-IO42. I HAVE thought it right to narrate the course of events by which the Danish power was established in England at nearly as great detail as I purpose to narrate the central events of my history. The Danish and Norman Conquests 1 Our authorities for this period are nearly the same as those for the reign of \u00c6thelred. The Chronicles and Florence are still our main guides, and, as Florence draws nearer to his own time, he more commonly inserts independent matter which is not to be found in the Chronicles. We get the same kind of supplementary help as before from the secondary English authorities, the later and the local writers. We have the same hard task as before in trying to reconcile the English accounts with the various Scan dinavian sagas and chronicles. The Encomium Emm\u00e6 becomes of greater importance, but it must still be used with caution, as it is clear that the writer, though contemporary, was deeply prejudiced and often very ill informed. We now also begin to draw our first help from one most valuable document, the contemporary Life of Eadward the Confessor, published by Mr. Luard. This was written, between the years 1066 and 1074, by one who was inti mately acquainted with Godwine and his family, and it helps us to many facts and aspects of facts which are not to be found elsewhere. But the most important point with regard to our authorities for this time is that we must now cease to quote the English Chronicles as one work. The differ ences between the various copies now begin to assume a real historical importance. The narratives often differ widely from each other, and often show widely different ways of looking at men and things. They show that something very like the distinction of Whig and Tory can be traced as far back as the eleventh century. I first pointed out the difference of feeling which the different Chronicles display with regard to Godwine in a paper on the Earl's Life and Death, in the Arch\u00e6ological Journal for 1S54-1855. Since that time Mr. Earle, in the Introduction to his \"Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel,\" has gone fully and exhaustively into the matter from his point of view, and has given what may be called VOL.

Within the realm of England itself we do not hear of a single disturbance. And the forces of England had now but seldom to be employed against Celtic enemies within her own island. One Scottish in vasion of England, one English invasion of Wales, make up nearly the whole of the warfare of this reign within our own seas. There was indeed warfare enough elsewhere, war fare in which Englishmen had their share. But the details of Cnut's wars in the Scandinavian North are often not a little doubtful, and, even if they were far better ascer tained, they would not call for any minute attention at the hands of an historian either of England or of Normandy. After Cnut's power was once fully established in England, biographies of the various records which are commonly confounded under the name of \" the Saxon Chronicle.\" I shall hereafter follow Mr. Earie's nomenclature (grounded on that of Jocelin, Secretary to Archbishop Parker), and shall quote them as follows. The manuscript commonly quoted as \" C. C. C. C. clxxiv.\" I quote as the Winchester Chronicle. For our period this Chronicle contains only a few entries added at Canterbury. '\u2022 Cott. Tib.

(This part however was composed at Worcester, the Chronicle being transcribed and continued at Peterborough.) \"Cott. Domit. A. viii.\" is Canterbury, the least valuable of all, but of more importance now than in earlier times. 1 Cnut or Knud, in one syllable, is this King's true name, and the best Latin form is Cnuto, according to the usual way of Latinizing Scandinavian names. See above, p. 165. The form Canntus seems to have arisen from Pope Paschal the Second's inability to say Cnut. The later King Cnut, the supposed martyr, was therefore canonized by him as \" Sanetus Canutus.\" See \u00c6thelnoth's Life of Saint Cnut, capp. iv. vi. xxxiii. (Langebek, iii. 340, 382). The writer, an English monk settled in Denmark, thinks the lengthening of the name a great honour, and compares it with the change from Abram to Abraham ; but he somewhat inconsistently cuts down his own name to Ailnothus."], [451, "CHARACTER OF THE PERIOD. 403 we have next to no purely English events to record. Still chap. vi. there are few periods of our history which call for more attentive study. We have to contemplate the wonderful character of the man himself, his almost unparalleled position, the general nature of his government and policy. A few particular events which directly connect English and Norman history will also need a special examination. Of one event, more important than all in its results, no man could discern the importance at the moment. While Cnut sat on the throne of England, William the Bastard 1027 first saw the light at Falaise. ]028. The remainder of the period contained in this Chapter, Character taking in the reigns of the two sons of Cnut, is of a reigns of different character. The reigns of those two worthless *f cnut8 youths were short and troubled, and the accounts which we find in our best authorities are singularly contradictory. But the seven years between the death of Cnut and the election of Eadward are highly important in many ways. Several men who were to play the most important part in the times immediately following, men formed under Cnut, but who, while he lived, were overshadowed by their sovereign, now come forth into full prominence. Foremost among them all is the renowned name of Godwine, Earl of the West-Saxons. These reigns also prepared the way for the Norman Conquest in a most remarkable, though an indirect manner. The great scheme of Cnut, the establish ment of an Anglo-Scandinavian Empire, fell to pieces after his death through the divisions and misgovernment of his sons. Harold and Harthacnut disgusted Englishmen with Danish rule, and led them to fall back on one of their own countrymen as their King. But the English King thus chosen proved to be, for all practical purposes, a French man, and his French tendencies directly paved the way for the coming of William. Now it is not likely that any power whatever could have permanently kept all Cnut's D d 2,"], [452, "404 THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. chap. vr. crowns upon the same head. But had his sons been at all worthy of him, a powerful dynasty, perhaps none the less English in feeling because Danish in blood, might well have been established in England. Under such a dynasty it is still possible that England might have been con- quered in the open field. But it is quite impossible that the path of the Conqueror should have been made ready for him in the way that it actually was by the weakness of Eadward and the intrigues of the foreign favourites with whom he surrounded himself. \u00a7 1. The Reign of Cnut in England. 101 7-1035.

He was in actual possession of the larger half of the kingdom. But Cnut, if valiant, was also wary; it might be too much, especially at this stage of his life, to attri- bute to him any actual shrinking from bloodshed; but he at least fully understood the value of constitutional forms, and he had no wish to resort to violence when his 1 Nothing can be made of the unintelligible story in Snorro (c. 25 ; Laing, ii. 21, and see Appendix W), according to which the sons of \u00c6thelred and Emma, assisted by Olaf of Norway and his foster-father Rane, made an unsuccessful attempt upon England after Eadmund's death. The tale may have arisen from some confusion with the later attempt on behalf of the \u00c6thelings made by Duke Robert of Normandy. Snorro is throughout, as we shall often have occasion to see, most ill-informed on English affairs. Can this Rane be the same as Ranig, whom we find Earl of the Mages\u00e6tas twenty years later ? 2 See above, p. 367. s See above, p. 381."], [453, "FINAL ELECTION OF CNUT. 405 purpose could be better accomplished by peaceful means, chap. vi. He was determined to be King of all England;1 he was equally determined not to parade the right of conquest offensively before the eyes of his new subjects, but to rest his claim to the crown on an authority which no man could gainsay.

The usual compact1 between King and people was gone through, with a further mutual promise on the part of Danes and English to forget all old grudges. Money was, as a matter of course, to be paid to the Danish army. The new King was crowned, no doubt in Saint Paul's minster, by Archbishop Lyfing.2 Measures for the security of the new dynasty were taken. With regard to the \u00c6theling Eadwig, who is described as a prince of high character and the object of universal esteem, the jealousy of Cnut was not satisfied with his exclusion from the crown. A decree of outlawry was passed against him, as also against another Eadwig, who is unknown to us, except that he bears the strange title of King of the Churls.3 This last Eadwig is said to have made his peace with the King ; but Eadwig the \u00c6theling \u2014 so at least the rumour of the time said \u2014 was treacherously murdered by Cnut's order before the year was out. chap. vi. Outlawry of the two Eadwigs. Murder of the \u00c6theling Eadwig. In this important Gemot a division of England was made which shows how thoroughly at home the new King already felt in his new kingdom. It is clear from the whole course of Cnut's reign that of all his dominions England was that which he most prized. In the midst of his most brilliant victories England was always his fa vourite dwelling-place, better loved than his native Denmark, better loved than any of the other lands which he brought under his power. In the roll-call of his titles England held the first place. England was his home ; she was, as it were, the love of his youth ; her crown., was the prize which he had won with his own right hand, when he had as yet neither inherited the ancestral kingship of Denmark Cnut's pre ference for England, 1 Fl. 1017. \" F\u0153dus etiam cum principibus et omni populo (see Ap pendix Q) ipse, et illi cum ipso percusserunt.\" 2 See Appendix TT. 3 On the two Eadwigs, see Appendix YY."], [455, "CNUT'S PREFERENCE FOR ENGLAND. 407 nor spread his dominion over Norwegians, Swedes, and chap. vi.

Already King of the Northumbrians and Mercians, it would not have been wonderful if he had fixed the seat of his rule in his own half-Danish realm, and had dealt with East-Anglia and the Saxon shires as conquered dependencies. And we may conceive that the future history of England might have been different in many ways, if York had been permanently established by Cnut as the capital of the kingdom. But Cnut, when once chosen King by the Witan of all England, was determined to fill in every thing the place of the Kings of the English who had been before him. Those Kings were primarily Kings of the West-Saxons; the other English kingdoms were depen dencies of the West-Saxon state. They had gradually been more or less closely incorporated with the dominant realm, but they still remained distinct governments, each with its own Ealdorman and its own Gemot. This form of administration was continued, and was more definitely organized by Cnut.

Eric the King's brother-in-law was confirmed in, or restored to, the government of North humberland, with which he had been invested a year before.1 Eadric, as the reward of his treasons and mur ders, was again appointed to his old earldom of Mercia. But the signatures to the charters show that the title of Earl was by no means confined to these three great viceroys. As before with the title of Ealdorman, so now its equivalent Earl was the title borne alike by the governor of an ancient kingdom and by the subordinate governor of one or more shires.2 We can trace the names of several such Earls, both English and Danish, through the charters of Cnut's reign. And among them we see, as filling a marked and special position, the name of one who was presently to become the first man in the English Empire \u2014 one who rose to power by the favour of strangers, only to become the champion of our land against strangers of every race \u2014 one who, never himself a King, was to be the maker, the kinsman, the father of Kings.

We feel that we are at last drawing near to the real centre of our history when we bring in the name of the great champion of England against Norman influence, the father of the King who died as her champion against Norman invasion. The sudden and mysterious rise of this Probably Eadric kept the English title ; if so, it was its last use in the old half-kingly sense, and in a year or two the title dies out altogether from the Chronicles, though its use still goes on in private documents, and even in Cnut's own Laws. 1 See above, p. 379. 2 So we now apply the title of Lord Lieutenant \u2014 the nearest modern approach to the ancient Ealdorman \u2014 both to the Viceroy of the ancient kingdom of Ireland and to the military chief of a single county."], [457, "FIRST APPEARANCE OF GODWINE. 409 great man is one of the most striking features of our chap. vi. history, and his origin is perhaps the most obscure and difficult question of all the obscure and difficult questions which our history presents.

He became a personal, favourite with the King, high in his confidence, and he soon rose to greater power and dignity still. Cnut's Cnut's power now seemed firmly established ; at the with same time he thought it expedient to resort to more Emma11\" than one means of strengthening it. In the month of July, 1017. July in this year he contracted a marriage which is one of the most singular on record. The widow of \u00c6thelred, \u00c6lfgifu-Emma, was asked to share the English throne a second time. Nothing loth, she came over from Nor mandy, married the new King, and took up her old position as Lady of the English.1 Fifteen years before, she had in her youth crossed the sea on the same errand ; now, a mature widow, she gave herself to a man who was much younger than herself, who had overturned the throne of her first husband, and had driven her children Motives into banishment. Cnut s motives for this singular mar for the . ... marriage, riage are not very clear, unless, as one historian suggests, it was part of his system of reconciliation. He wished, we are told, to win the hearts of the English, and to make as little change as possible in the appearance of the English court, by putting again in her old place a Lady to whom they were accustomed.2 But this would seem to imply that Emma enjoyed a popularity among the English, which the foreign woman, the cause of so many evils, was not likely to have won. If a connexion with the ducal house of Normandy was all that Cnut aimed at, a marriage with one of Duke Richard's daughters would have seemed a more natural alliance for the young 1 On the marriage of Cnut and Emma, see Appendix BBB. 2 Will.

But it is possible, after all, that personal preference may really have led to this strange match. There is some slight reason to think that Cnut and Emma may have met for the purposes of negotiation during the siege of London.1 And Emma, though much older than Cnut, may still have kept much of the beauty which won her the title of the Gem of the Normans.2 The marriage was, after all, less strange than one which had scandalized the West-Frankish court two generations earlier. Eadgifu, the daughter of Eadward, the sister of \u00c6thelstan, the widow of Charles, the mother of Lewis, had, when already a grandmother of some standing, eloped with the young 95 '\u2022 and handsome Count Herbert, and had bestowed two half-brothers on her royal son.3 At any rate, whatever may have been Cnut's motive in his marriage with the royal widow, it is certain that at the time of his forming this more exalted connexion he was, like so many of the Norman Dukes, already hampered by an earlier connexion of that doubtful kind of which I have often spoken.4 Cnut had already taken as his concubine or Danish wife, Cnut's \u00c6lfgifu of Northampton, the daughter of \u00c6lfhelm the with murdered Earl of the Northumbrians. By her Cnut believed himself to be the father of two sons, Haroldton and Swegen, who after his death succeeded to two of his kingdoms. But scandal affirmed that neither of them was really of kingly birth. The barren \u00c6lfgifu 1 See Appendix VV. 2 Hen. Hunt. M. H.

But it was doubtless the existence of one or other of these children which made Emma stipulate, as she is said to have done, that the throne should pass to Cnut's children by her, to the exclusion of those by any other wife. The King agreed, no doubt only so far as he constitutionally could ; the marriage took place, and was blessed with the births of Harthacnut and Gunhild. Emma seems to have utterly forgotten, not only the memory of \u00c6thelred, but the existence of her children by him ; her whole love was transferred to the young Danish King and to the children whom she bore to him. The marriages of Emma would seem to have needed a bloodbath as their necessary attendant. Her bridal with \u00c6thelred was almost immediately followed by the great massacre of the Danes -,1 her second bridal with Cnut was followed in the like sort, if not by an actual massacre, yet by a considerable slaughter of Englishmen who were felt to be dangerous to the Danish monarch. The whole course of the year was marked by executions Fate of the and banishments. The \u00c6theling Eadwig, the most dan \u00c6thelred. gerous of Cnut's possible competitors, was removed as we have seen.2 The rumour of his assassination at least implies that he died during the year in some way or other. Of the other sons of \u00c6thelred's first marriage we can give no account, except of those who seem to have been already dead.

His half-brother, Olaf or James, the son of his mother Sigrid,4 now reigned over Sweden. To him he sent the babes, begging him to put them to death. The Swede, a zealous propagator of Christianity in his own dominions,5 abhorred the crime, but stood in fear of his brother's power. He therefore sent the children to the King of the Hungarians, the sainted Stephen,6 to be saved alive and brought up. Both lived, and one will appear again 1 See above, p. 374.

This last name introduces us to a family which was to play a most important part in the times immediately before and immediately after the Norman Conquest.3 Of Leofwine personally we know nothing; the fate of his son Northman is in one of our accounts specially connected with the fate of Eadric.4 One thing is plain, that Northman's offence, whatever it was, was something wholly personal to himself and in no way touched the rest of his family.5 This fact, together with the advancement of Godwine, should be carefully borne in mind. Whatever was the justice or injustice of these executions,0 they were at least no part of any deliberate 1 So Florence; \"in nativitate Domini, cum esset Lundoni\u00e6.\" A different order of events might perhaps be inferred from the Chronicles ; but Florence is clearly more careful in his arrangement in this place. \" \u00c6ftelm\u00e6res p\u00e6s greatan,\" say the Abingdon, Worcester, and Peter borough annalists.

The new King however kept a careful eye on all who Treatment were in any way connected with the English royal family. in_iaw 0f The sons-in-law of \u00c6thelred seem to have awakened the \u00c6tbelred suspicions of Cnut almost as strongly as his sons. Of the daughters of \u00c6thelred three were certainly married, to Eadric, to Uhtred, and to an unknown \u00c6thelstan.2 A fourth is said to have been the wife of Ulfcytel, and to have passed with his East- Anglian government to the Dane Thurkill. All these men were gradually got rid of by death or banishment. \u00c6thelstan and Ulfcytel had had the good luck to die in open battle. We have already seen how easily Cnut was led to consent to the death of Uhtred,3 and we shall presently see Thurkill himself, to Thurkill , \u201e , . . -ii- l \u2022 banished. whom Cnut in a great measure owed his crown, driven ]03I into banishment.

So short a time had he I0I7 enjoyed the dignity which he had kept or recovered by so many treasons. That he was put to death at this time is certain, but that is nearly all that can be said.

If this be the necessary meaning of the Ramsey writer, his authority is very small on such a point, and the general course of Cnut's conduct looks quite the other way. 2 See Appendix SS. 3 See above, p. 379. * On the different versions of the tale, see Appendix DDD."], [464, "THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. 416 crimes, was an Englishman of the highest rank; in the absence of available male heirs, his marriage made him in some sort the nearest representative of the royal house; the very success of his repeated crimes shows that he must, somehow or other, have obtained the lead of a considerable party. In all these characters he was dan gerous ; Cnut must have felt that a man who had so often betrayed his former masters would have as little scruple about betraying him ; x he could hardly avoid confirming him in his earldom in the assembly of the former winter, but he had doubtless already made up his mind to seize on the first opportunity to destroy him. We may believe that Cnut, as we are told in most versions of the story, gave himself out as the avenger of his adopted brother ; but the removal of the arch-traitor was a step which prudence, as prudence was understood by Cnut at that stage of his reign, called for fully as much as justice. CHAP. VI. The character and career of Eadric, like those of \u00c6lfric, his predecessor in office and in crime,2 form one of the standing puzzles of history. It is hard to understand the motives for such constant and repeated treasons on the part of one who had, solely by royal favour, risen from nothing to the highest rank in the state. It is equally difficult to understand by what sort of fascination he could have found the means either to work his treasons or to blind the eyes of those who suffered by them. That both his crimes and his influence have been much exaggerated is highly probable. It is likely enough that he has been made the scape-goat for many of the sins both of other individuals and of the whole nation. A tendency of this Character and influ ence of Eadric. 1 So Florence ; \" Quia timebat insidiis ab eo aliquando circumveniri, sicut domini sui priores \u00c6gelredus et Eadmundus frequenter sunt circum venti.\" 2 See above, pp. 278, 326."], [465, "CHARACTER OF EADRIC. 417 kind to lay all blame upon some one man is not nncom- chap. vi. mon. Thus in our Norman history we have seen all the mischief that happened attributed at one time to Arnulf of Flanders, and at another to Theobald of Chartres.1 But exaggeration of this kind must have had some sub stantial ground to go upon. Without necessarily be lieving that Eadric personally wrought all the countless and inexplicable treasons which are laid to his charge, it is impossible to doubt that he knew how to exercise an extraordinary influence over men's minds, and that that influence was always exerted for evil. It may be observed Two classes that the crimes attributed to him fall into two classes, ascribed to His treasons on the field of battle, at Sherstone aud at Eadrlc- Assandun, were wrought openly in the sight of two armies, and, asserted as they are by contemporary writers,' we cannot do otherwise than accept them. But there is Difference another class of charges which do not rest on the same credibility firm ground. Such are his supposed share in the deaths \u00b0^ t!ro of Eadmund and Eadwig, his advice to destroy the children charges. of Eadmund, and other cases where his counsel is said to have led to various crimes and mischiefs, or to have thwarted the accomplishment of wise and manly purposes. Some of these charges are not found in our best autho rities, and, of those which are, some may well be merely the surmises of the time, going on the general principle that, whenever any mischief was done, Eadric must needs be the doer of it. The annalists could not well be mis taken as to Eadric's conduct on the field of Assandun ; they might easily be mistaken as to any particular piece of advice said to have been given by him to \u00c6thelred, to Eadmund, or to Cnut. In these last cases their statements prove little more than the universal belief that Eadric was capable of every wickedness. But that universal belief, though it proves little as to this or that particular action, 1 See above, p. 205, 233. VOL. I. e e"], [466, "418 THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. chap. vi. proves everything as to Eadric's general character. After making every needful deduction, enough is left, not only to brand the name of Eadric with infamy, but to brand it with infamy of a peculiar kind, which holds him up as a remarkable study of human character as well for the philosopher as for the historian. We have much more both of crime and of sorrow to go through in the course of our history; it is at least some comfort that no sinner of the peculiar type of Eadric will occur again. Leofwine By the death of Eadric his earldom of Mercia became SUCC6CU.S Eadric in vacant. It was most likely conferred on Leofwine, the Christmas fother of the slain Northman, who had seemingly hitherto I0I7- held the ealdormanship of the Hwiccas under the superior rule of Eadric.1 And an earldom held by Northman, per haps that of Chester, is said to have been conferred on his brother Leofric, who some years later succeeded his father in the government of all Mercia. The next year we hear that a fleet of thirty pirate ships, seemingly coming to' attack England, was cut off by Cnut. Thus, as a contemporary writer says, he who had once been the destroyer of the land had now become its Payment defender.2 In the same year a heavy Danegeld was paid, geld. doubtless that which had been agreed upon in the treaty 101 between Cnut and Eadmund at Olney.3 London paid ten thousand five hundred 4 pounds, and the rest of England 1 See Appendix CCC. 2 Thietmar, viii. 5. \"In Anglis triginta navium habitatores pirat\u00e6 a rege eorum, Suenni regis filio, Deo gratias, occisi sunt ; et qui prius cum patre hujus erat invasor et assiduus destructor provinci\u00e6, nunc solas sedit defensor, ut in Libycis basiliscus arenis cultore vacuis.\" a It took some time to collect these large sums. Thus the Danegeld voted in 1011 was paid in 1012. See above, pp. 350-355. This Danegeld is referred to in Huming's Worcester Cartulary, 248 (Mon.

This is something like a chap. vi. measure of the position which the great merchant city held in the kingdom.

The renewal of the laws of Eadgar has the same meaning as the renewal of the laws of Rolf after the expulsion of the French from Normandy, as the renewal of the laws of Cnut after the expulsion of Tostig from Northumberland, as the often promised and often evaded renewal of the laws of Eadward in the days of the Norman Florence. \u00a311000, according to the Peterborough and Canterbury Chronicles. 1 See above, p. 373. 2 The Abingdon Chronicle has only, \"And Dene and Engle wurdon s\u00e6mm\u00e6le \u00e6t Oxnaforda.\" The Worcester annalist makes the important addition, \" to Eadgares lage.\" So Florence ; \" Angli et Dani apud Oxena fordam de lege regis Eadgari tenenda Concordes sunt effecti.\" 3 See above, p. 218. e e 2"], [468, "THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. 420 chap. vi. Kings of England. It does not always imply that the princes spoken of were specially looked on as lawgivers. Eadgar and Cnut had undoubtedly some claim to that title, but we know not that Rolf had any, and Eadward certainly had none. But the demand does not refer to codes of law issued, or believed to be issued, by any of these princes. The cry is really, as an ancient writer explains it,1 not for the laws which such a King enacted, but for the laws which such a King observed. It is in fact a demand for good government in a time of past or expected oppression or maladministration. It is, as in this case, a demand that a foreign King should take the best of his native predecessors as his model. The name of the last King who left behind him a name for just and mild government is taken as the embodiment of all just and mild government. The people in effect demand, and the King in effect promises, that his government shall be as good as that of the popular hero whose name is put forward. Now, with a foreign conqueror for their King, with the ancient kingly house cut down to a few exiled children, with the flower of the ancient nobility cut off in the carnage of Assandun, Englishmen looked back with yearning to the days of their native rulers. The reign of \u00c6thelred was a time which the national memory would be The me- glad to deal with as a blank. English imagination leaped Eado-ar back to the glorious and happy days of the peaceful bothPtobth Basileus, when Englishmen beat their swords into plough- English shares and their spears into pruning-hooks, when the and to the .

And the name of Eadgar was one which would be hardly less acceptable to the Danes than to the English themselves. When their King was more and more throwing off the feelings of a conqueror, when he was more and more closely making himself at one with the realm which he had won, when the Earls and Thegns of the conquered land stood around his throne on a perfect level with the proudest of their conquerors, when the mass of the victorious army had just been sent away to their own homes, the Danish followers of Cnut might well tremble, not only for their supremacy over the vanquished English, but almost for their equality with them. To them the name of Eadgar may well have represented a prince who was raised to the throne in a great measure by Danish swords, who, while he defended his island against Danish invasions, did full justice to the Dane within his own realm, who guaranteed to his Danish subjects every right that they could desire, and whose fondness for them, among other strangers, was the only fault with which Englishmen could reproach him.1 Danes and Englishmen therefore joined in looking back to Eadgar as the ideal of kingship, and in demanding of their com- mon sovereign that he should take that incomparable2 example as the model of his government. Men of both nations looked back to the happy days of Eadgar, as in after days the Northumbrians, groaning under the tyranny of Tostig, looked back to the happy days of Cnut himself and demanded the renewal of his law. They looked back Contrast to them, as Englishmen under the Norman yoke looked Cnut a*d back to the happy days of Eadward, and put forth the g 1 See above, p. 65. 2 \" Incomparabilis Eadgarus,\" says Cnut in his Glastonbury Charter, which, if spurious, as marked by Mr. Kemble (Cod.

That prayer was not, and could not be, granted, till the swords of Robert Fitzwalter and Simon of Montfort had won back for us more than the laws of Eadward in another shape. The great Dane was more happily placed. With him the renewal of the ancient laws was neither an empty nor an impossible promise. If by renewing the laws of Eadgar was meant the establishment of a rule as strong and as just and as safe against foreign invasion as that of Eadgar, King Cnut fully kept his word.1 CHAP. VI. Cnut had now been absent from his native country for five years. He had stayed in England ever since his re turn thither after he had been driven out by the solitary military exploit of King \u00c6thelred the Unready.2 It was clearly his intention to make England the seat of his empire,3 but as he was now, by the death or deposition of his brother Harold, sovereign of Denmark,4 and as England was perfectly quiet and reconciled to his govern ment, he deemed it , expedient to pay a visit to the land of his birth.5 He took with him Godwine, whose conduct in this foreign journey, perhaps in one of Cnut's northern wars, procured him a still higher degree of his sovereign's esteem.6 According to one account, it was by a gallant 1014-5.

Godwine, without the King's knowledge, attacked the enemy by night at the head of his countrymen, routed them utterly, and occupied their camp. In the morning Cnut missed the English portion of his army, and hastily inferred that they had deserted, or even gone over to the enemy. He marched however to the Wendish camp, and there, to his surprise, found Godwine and the English in possession, and nothing left of the Wends but their dead bodies and their spoil. This exploit, we are told, greatly raised both Godwine and the English in general in the opinion of Cnut. The tale has a mythical sound ; but, whatever may be the truth or false hood of its details, that Godwine rose still higher from the time of this Danish expedition is beyond doubt.

The father of Thurgils, Biorn, was the offspring of a bear, who carried off a human damsel.1 Ulf himself is said to have served in Cnut's English wars, and according to one version, it was to him that Godwine owed his earliest introduction to Cnut.2 But in English history he plays hardly any part.3 His 1 Saxo (193) tells the tale at length.

She shared the momentary banishment of her husband in the days of Norman in trigue, and she lived to undergo an eternal banishment in the days of Norman dominion. No mother was ever surrounded by a fairer or more hopeful offspring; none ever underwent a longer series of hopeless bereavements. She saw a nephew on the throne of Denmark, a daughter and a son on the throne of England. She saw her other children and kinsfolk ruling as princes in England and allying themselves with princes in foreign lands. But she also saw her brother cut off by the hand of his kinsman and sovereign ; she saw one son stained with the blood of a cousin, and another son stained with treason against his house and country. Of her remaining sons she saw three cut off in one day by the most glorious of deaths, while the sole survivor dragged on his weary days in a Norman prison.

It was now that Godwine received a title and office Godwine which no man had borne before him, but which, saving Earl of the the few months of his banishment, he bore for the thirty- Sa^n3 two remaining- years of his life, the title and office of Earl [ioao- . . .

He was now already King of two kingdoms, and he had no doubt by this time began to meditate a further extension of his dominion in the North.

Wessex then, the ancient hearth and home of English kingship, now for the first time received an immediate ruler of a rank inferior to that of Kins'. Godwine became the first, and his son Harold was the second and last, of the Earls of the West- Saxons. To reduce the ancient kingdom to an earldom was not, as has been sometimes imagined, any badge of the insolence of a conqueror ; the act was in no way 1 All the Chronicles, and also Florence, mention this banishment of \u00c6thelweard. 2 On Godwine's West-Saxoo earldom, see Appendix AAA."], [474, "THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. 426 analogous to the change of Northumberland from a king dom to an earldom under Eadred. The case is simply that the King of all England and all Denmark, King in a special manner of the old West-Saxon realm, found the need of a special counsellor, and in absence of a viceroy, even in this his chosen and immediate dominion. No man of the kindred or nation of the conqueror, but Godwine, the native Englishman, was found worthy of this new and exalted post. Through the whole remainder of the reign of Cnut, the great Earl of the West-Saxons ruled in un interrupted honour and influence. The wealth which he acquired, mainly, it may be supposed, by royal grant, was enormous. His possessions extended into nearly every shire of the south aud centre of England. Whether the son of the churl or the great-nephew of the traitor, he was now, three years after the completion of the Danish Conquest, beyond all doubt the first subject in the realm. CHAP. VI. Consecra tion of the church on Assandun. The year of Cnut's return and of Godwine's great promotion beheld the King engaged in a remarkable solemnity on the spot which had witnessed his last battle, his only distinct victory, in his great struggle with Eng lish Eadmund. On the hill of Assandun, Cnut, in part nership with Thurkill, at once as Earl of the district and as his chief comrade in the battle, had reared a church, which was consecrated, in the presence of the King and the Earl, by Wulfstan, Archbishop of York, and several other bishops. That the ceremony was performed by the Northern Metropolitan was probably owing to a vacancy in the see of Canterbury. Lyfing, who had crowned Cnut, died in the course of the year, and was succeeded, by \u00c6thelnoth the Good,1 who had baptized or confirmed him.2 The ceremony .at Assandun doubt less took place between these two events.

Cnut how ever employed the rarer material, and the fact that his church was built of stone and lime was looked on as something worthy of distinct record.1 The stone church of Assandun was something remarkable in Essex, exactly as the wooden church of Glastonbury2 was something remarkable in Somerset. But the building was small and mean, at least as compared with the stately pile which the next conqueror of England reared in memory of his victory. The foundation of Cnut and Thurkill, for a single priest,3 was poor and scanty, compared with the lordly Abbey of Saint Martin of the Place of Battle.4 But the minster of Battle simply spoke of the subjugation of a land by a foreign conqueror ; the minster of Assandun told a nobler tale. It was reared as the hallowing of his victory, as the atonement for his earlier crimes, by a prince who, conqueror as he was, had learned to love the land which he had conquered, to feel himself one with CHAP. VI. 1 The Canterbury Chronicle is fuller than the others on this head, calling the building \" an mynster of stane and lime.\" This is one of the passages which have been strangely applied to prove that stone architecture was hardly known in England before the Norman Conquest. Any one who knows the buildings of Essex, as compared with those of Somerset or Northamptonshire, will at once see that the notice of a stone building as something singular must be purely local. The present church of Ashington contains no detail earlier than the last years of the twelfth century ; but I suspect that the walls are mainly those of Cnut's minster. 2 Will.

With him his English wife Eadgyth had to leave her country; if she was the daughter of \u00c6thelred, and the widow of either Ulfcytel or Eadric,2 we are almost driven to infer that the marriage was contracted after the consecration on Assandun, that the connexion with the ancient royal family awakened Cnut's jealousy, and was in fact the cause of Thurkill's banishment. One cannot help seeling a certain interest in the fate of one who had so long played an important and, on the whole, not a dishonourable, part in English history. The savage pirate gradually changed into the civilized warrior; if at one time he was the enemy, he was at another the de fender, of England. The heathen who had striven to save a Christian martyr from his persecutors had developed the good seed within him till he grew into a founder and restorer of Christian churches. With the banishment which I have just recorded the history of Thurkill, as far as England is concerned, comes to an end. But his banishment was merely local ; he was held to be dangerous in Eng-land, and he was therefore removed from the country, but his removal was little more than an honour able ostracism. He kept, or soon won back, his sove reign's favour ; there is no evidence that he ever came back to England ; but two years later he was formally reconciled to Cnut ; he was established as his viceroy in Thurkill Denmark, seemingly as guardian to one of the King's of sons who was meant to succeed him in that kingdom.3 Denmark. 1023- The only sign of suspicion shown on Cnut's part was his bringing back the son of Thurkill with him to England, evidently as a hostage.

No doubt Cnut had largely rewarded his followers with grants of 1 Fl. Wig. 1046. 2 See Appendix GGG. 3 Fl. Wig. 1041, and vol. ii. Appendix G. Thored was perhaps Thurkill's nephew.

Dipl. iv. 43) signed by a crowd of Danish names otherwise unknown. But this is a charter relating wholly to Northumbrian affairs, and the signatures are no doubt those of local thegns, many of whom were most likely not followers of Cnut, but descendants of the Danish settlers in \u00c6lfred's time."], [480, "432 THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. land, and we can well believe that some of these new Danish thegns often behaved with great insolence to their English neighbours.1 But the general principle of Cnut's government is not affected by any local wrongs of this kind. Cnut, from the very beginning, admitted Englishmen to high office; still, in the earlier years of his reign he appears mainly as a foreign conqueror sur rounded by those whose arms had won his crown for him. He gradually changes into a prince, English in all but actual birth, who could afford to dispense with the dangerous support of the chieftains of his own nation, who could venture to throw himself on the loyalty of those whom he had subdued, and to surround himself with the natural leaders of those whom he had learned to look on as his own people. CHAP. VI, This gradual change in the disposition of Cnut makes him one of the most remarkable, and, to an Englishman, one of the most interesting, characters in history. There is no other instance \u2014 unless Rolf in Normandy be admitted as a forerunner on a smaller scale \u2014 of a barbarian con queror, entering a country simply as a ruthless pirate, Character of Cnut. 1 Something of this sort, which is quite likely in itself, is implied in some stories told by the Eamsey historian, who enters into much detail about various Danish thegns at this time. For instance, in cap. lxxxiv. (p. 440) we read about the Dane Thurkill when summoned before the Bishop's court ; \" Quo citato apparere contemnente, a severitate tamen merit\u00e6 ultionis censuit episcopus ad tempus temperandum, ne Anglus Dacum ad regis injuriam injuste vcxare dicerttur.\" Cnut however steps in to support the law against his grantee. In cap. lxxxvi. again is a story about a Danish thegn, who greatly oppressed the neighbouring \"rustici,\" who conspired his death. He is \"vir factiosus et dives, qui Anglorum animos ex suo ponderans, illis Dacos fore semper exosos, quod patriam suam invasissent, et sibi insidias, occulte tamen propter metum regis, ab eis parari arbitrates. \" He escapes by selling his estate to the Bishop, who was always on the look-out for such chances, and who gave it to Ramsey abbey. The really important point in the story is an aUusion to Welsh robbers (\"Britones latrones\") as still possible in Huntingdonshire in the time of Cnut."], [481, "CHARACTER OF CNUT. 433 plundering, burning, mutilating, slaughtering, without chap. vi. remorse, and then, as soon as he is firmly seated on the throne of the invaded land, changing into a beneficent ruler and lawgiver, and winning for himself a place side by side with the best and greatest of its native sovereigns. Cnut never became a perfect prince like \u00c6lfred. An insatiable ambition possessed him throughout life, and occasional acts of both craft and violence disfigure the whole of his career. No man could charge him with that amiable weakness through which Eadmund lent so ready an ear to protestations of repentance and promises of amendment even from the lips of Eadric. Cnut, on the other hand, always found some means, by death, by banishment, by distant promotion, of getting rid of any one who had once awakened his suspicions. Reasons of state were as powerful with him, and led him into as many unscrupulous actions, as any more civilized despot of later times. But Englishmen were not disposed to canvass the justice of wars in which they won fame and plunder, while no enemy ever set foot on their own shores. They were as little disposed to canvass the justice of banishments and executions, when, for many years, it was invariably a Dane, never an Englishman, who was the victim.

As an English King, he fairly ranks beside Cnut's the noblest of his predecessors. His best epitaph is his Rome.fr0m famous letter to his people on his Roman pilgrimage.1 l\u00b02<- Such a pilgrimage was an ordinary devotional observance according to the creed of those times. But in the eyes of Cnut it was clearly much more than a mere perfunctory ceremony. The sight of the holy places stirred him to good resolves in matters both public and private, and, as a patriotic King, he employed his meeting with the Pope, the Emperor, and the Burgundian King, to win from all of them favours which were profitable to the people of his various realms. No man could have written in the style in which Cnut writes to all classes of his English subjects, unless he were fully convinced that he possessed and deserved the love of his people. The tone of the letter is that of an absent father writing to his children. In all simplicity and confidence, he tells them the events of his journey; he tells them with what honours he had been received, and with what presents he had been loaded, by the two chiefs of Christendom, and what privileges for his subjects, both English and Danish, he had obtained at their hands. He confesses the errors of his youth, and promises reformation of anything which may still be amiss. All grievances shall be redressed; no extortions shall be allowed ; King Cnut needs no money raised by injustice. These are surely no mere formal or hypocritical professions; every word plainly comes from the heart. England had more than led captive her con- queror ; she had changed him into her King and father.

The local rights and customs of the Danish and English portions of the kingdom are to be strictly observed.4 But this is only what we have already seen in the legislation of Eadgar.5 The Danes spoken of in Cnut's laws, as in Eadgar's, are the long-settled Danish inhabitants of Northumberland and the other countries of the Denalagu ; no kind of preference is made in favour of Cnut's own Danish follow- ers ; we cannot doubt that a Dane who held lands in Wessex had to submit to English law, just as a West- Saxon who held lands in Northumberland must, under Eadgar no less than uuder Cnut, have had to submit to Danish law. On one point the legislation of the great Dane is distinctly more rational and liberal than the legislation of our own day. Trespasses on the King's forests are strictly forbidden ; but the natural right of every man to hunt on his own land is emphatically as- serted.'1 And as Cnut's theory was, so was his practice. No King was more active in what was then held to be the first duty of kingship, that of constantly going through every portion of his realm to see with his own eyes whether the laws which he enacted were duly put in force.7 In short, after Cnut's power was once fully 1 ii. iS. \"And p\u00e6r beo on b\u00e6re scire bisceop and se ealdorman, and p\u00e6r \u00e6grSer t\u00e6can ge Godes riht ge woruld-riht.\" See Appendix K. a i. 20. 3 ii. 12, 14, 15. * ii. 1 5, 45,49,63, 66, 72,84. \"See above, p. 66. 6 ii. 81.

He bountifully rewards the sturdy peasant who proves the thickness of the ice over which the royal sledge has to pass.0 One tale alone sets him before us in a somewhat different light. He mocks at the supposed sanctity of Eadgyth< the daughter of Eadgar ; he will not believe in the holiness of any child of a father so given up to lust and tyranny. It is needless to add that the 1 See Appendix III. 2 See Appendix GGG. 3 Prior Godfrey (Satirical Poets, ii. 148) thus sums up his character ; \" Quique cruentus erat et in hostes pr\u00e6do superbus, In sibi subjectos regis habebat opus.

Cnut is represented as accepting the Eadgar of the minstrels, not the Eadgar of the monks, nor yet the Eadgar of history, who is somewhat different from either. But even in this tale Cnut is described as showing something of the spirit which breathes in his Roman letter. The King who loathed the supposed tyranny of Eadgar could hardly have been conscious of any tyranny of his own. CHAP. VI. In ecclesiastical matters Cnut mainly, though not ex clusively, favoured the monks. His ecclesiastical appoint ments, especially that of good Archbishop \u00c6thelnoth;2 who had baptized or confirmed him, do him high honour. He was also, after the custom of the age, a liberal bene factor to various ecclesiastical foundations. According to one account, not Assandun only, but all his battle-fields were marked by commemorative churches.3 But as As sandun was Cnut's only undoubted victory on English soil, and as men do not usually commemorate their defeats, we may conclude that, in England at least, Assandun was his only foundation of that kind. That church, as we have seen, was a secular foundation, seemingly for one priest only. A more splendid object of Cnut's munificence throws Cnut's ec clesiastical policy. 1020.

In Cnut's days it was doubtless still deemed a wonder of art, though it was doomed before the end of the century to give way to the vaster conceptions of the Norman architects. The invention and translation of the legendary Arthur were as yet distant events, and the new tomb of King Eadmund Ironside still kept the place of honour before the high altar.3 There the conqueror knelt and prayed, and covered the tomb of his murdered brother with a splendid robe on which the gorgeous plumage of the peacock was reproduced by the skilful needles of English embroideresses.4 Equal honours were paid by Cnut to another victim of the late wars, in his devotion to whom he was expiating the crimes of his nation, though not his own or those of his father's house.

The foreign Relations of Cnut. 1018-1035. Cnut had come into England as a conqueror and destroyer ; but his reign, as far as the internal state of England is concerned, was a time of perfect peace.1 No invasion Unparal from beyond sea, no revolt, no civil war, is recorded ternal during the eighteen years of his government. A single Pea?e , Scottish inroad and victory of which we shall presently reign of hear was wiped out by the more complete submission of the northern vassal of England. Within England itself we read of no district being ravaged either by rebels or by royal command ; we read of no city undergoing, or even being threatened with, military chastisement. This is more than can be said of the reign either of Eadgar the Peaceful or of Eadward the Saint. No doubt the whole nation was weary of warfare ; after a struggle of thirty-six years, England would have been glad of a season of repose, even under a far worse government than that of Cnut. But a period of seventeen years in which we cannot see that a sword was drawn within the borders 1 Compare Snorro's description of the reign of Cnut (c. 139; Laing, ii. 194) ; \"In his whole kingdom [seemingly both England and Denmark] peace was so well established that no man dared break it. The people of the country kept their peace towards each other, and had their old country law : and for this he was greatly celebrated in all countries.\""], [492, "THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. 444 chap. vi. of England was something altogether unparalleled in those warlike ages, something which speaks volumes in favour of the King who bestowed such a blessing on our land. It is true that the old enemies of England were now the fellow-subjects of Englishmen, and that the first attempt of her new enemies came to nought without a blow being struck. Danish invasions ceased when Den- mark and England had- the same King, and the first Norman invasion, as we shall presently see, ignominiously failed. But a great deal is proved by the absence of any recorded attempt on the part of any Englishman to get rid of the foreign King. No one thought of taking advantage of Cnut's frequent absences from England in the way in which men did take advantage of the similar absences of William the Norman. It is quite impossible that England and all Cnut's other kingdoms should have been kept down against their will by the King's The Housecarls. It is now that we first hear of this famous Housecarls or Thing- force, the name of which will be often heard during the following reigns, even after the Norman Conquest. Hitherto England had possessed nothing that could be called a standing army. When a war had to be waged, the King or Ealdorman called on his personal followers, attached to him by the ancient tie of the comitatus, and on the general levy, the fyrd or militia, either of the whole kingdom or of some particular part of it. But no Eng lish King or Ealdorman had hitherto kept a standing military force in his pay. But Cnut now organized a regular paid force, kept constantly under arms, and ready to march at a moment's notice.1 These were the famous Thingmen, the Housecarls, of whom we hear so much under Cnut and under his successors. This permanent body of soldiers in the King's personal service seems to have had its origin in the crews of the forty Danish 1 On the Housecarls, see Appendix KKK."], [493, "THE HOUSECARLS. 445 ships which were kept by Cnut when he sent back the chap. vi. greater part of his fleet in the seconct year of his reign. In his time the force consisted of three thousand, or at most of six thousand, men, gathered from all nations. For the power and fame of Cnut drew volunteers to his banner from all parts of Northern Europe. The force A revival was in fact a revival of the earliest form of the comitatus, Comitatus. only more thoroughly and permanently organized. The immediate followers, the' hearth-company, of earlier Kings and Ealdormen had been attached to them by a special tie, and were bound to bear to them a special fidelity in the day of battle.1 The Housecarls or Thingmen of Cnut were a force of this kind, larger in number, kept more constantly under arms, and subjected to a more regular discipline than had hitherto been usual. Receiving regu lar pay, and reinforced by volunteers of all kinds and of all nations, they doubtless gradually departed a good deal from the higher type of the comitatus, and came nearer to the level of ordinary mercenaries. So far as the force consisted of foreigners, they were mercenaries in the strictest sense ; so far as it consisted of Englishmen, they were mercenaries in no other sense than that in which all paid soldiers are mercenaries. The housecarls were in fact a standing army, and a standing army was an institution which later Kings and great Earls, English as well as Danish, found it to be their interest to continue. Under Cnut they formed a kind of military guild with the King at their head. A set of most elaborate articles The mili of war determined the minutest points of their duty.2 of Cnut.

But all the provisions of the code relate wholly to the internal discipline of the force and to the relations of its members to one another. Of the position in which they stood to the community at large we hear absolutely nothing. And it should be remembered that all our details come from Danish writers and those not contemporary. Our English authorities tell us nothing directly about the matter. The insti- From them we could at most have inferred that some tinued by institution of the sort arose about this time ; we never l~er read of housecarls before the reign of Cnut, while we Kings. \u00b0 often read of them afterwards. That a body of soldiers, many of them foreigners, were guilty of occasional acts of wrong and insolence, we may take for granted even without direct evidence. That under a bad King they might sometimes be sent on oppressive errands we shall presently see on the best of evidence. But that under the great Cnut they were the instruments of any general system of oppression, that they held the nation in un- willing submission to a yoke which it was anxious to throw off, is proved by no evidence whatever. And when England was again ruled by Kings of her own blood, the housecarls became simply a national standing army, and an army of which England might well be proud. The name of the housecarls of King Harold became a name of fear in the most warlike regions of the North,1 and it was this brave and faithful force which was ever foremost in fight and nearest to the royal person alike in the hour of victory and in the hour of overthrow. Foreign policy of Cnut. We have still to speak of Cnut's relations with lands be yond the bounds of England. This subject starts several important points in the history of foreign lands; but, as far as English history is concerned, most of them may 1 See vol. iii. ch. xiv., end of \u00a7 2."], [495, "RELATIONS WITH WALES. 447 be passed by in a few words. Within our own island, we chap. vi. hear little of Wales, and out of it, Cnut's wars with the other Scandinavian powers and his relations to the Empire, though highly important, have hardly any bearing on English history. The case is different with his dealings both with Scotland and with Normandy, both of which, the latter especially, call for a somewhat fuller ex amination. Cnut, as King of all England, alike by formal election and by the power of the sword, of course assumed the same Imperial claims and Imperial style which had been borne by the Kings who had gone before him. As King of all England, he was also Emperor of all Britain, Lord of all Kings and all nations within his own island. Of Relations his relations with his Welsh vassals we are driven to pick Wales. up what accounts we can from their own scanty annals. Early in Cnut's reign, on what provocation we know not, the exploit of Eadric Streona1 was repeated. Wales was Eglaf invaded by Eglaf, a Danish Earl in Cnut's service, pro- g.,mt bably the same who had joined in Thurkill's invasion Da\u2122 s of England, and who, according to some accounts, was brother of that more famous chief.2 He ravaged the land of Dyfed and destroyed Saint David's.3 This is our sole fact, except that in one of the last years of Cnut's reign, 1035 ? a Welsh prince, Caradoc son of Rhydderch, was slain by 1 See above, p. 351. 2 See above, p. 344, and Lappenberg's note at p. 475 in the original. Mr. Thorpe (ii. 210) has turned Eilaf or Eglaf into TJlf, to the utter perversion of Lappenberg's meaning. Eglaf's name is attached to several charters of Cnut. See Cod. Dipl. iv. 2, 28, 29. On the death of Cnut he is said (Brut y Tywysogion, 1036), for what cause we are not told, to have left England and to have sought a refuge in Germany. One can hardly doubt as to the identity of these two Eglafs ; yet the words of the Brut (1020) might almost make us think that Eglaf was some wandering wiking; \"After that Eilad (al. Eilaf) came to the isle of Britain, and Dyved was devastated and Menevia was demolished.\" 3 Ann. Camb. 1022. \"Eilaf vastavit Demetiam.

With Scotland the case is somewhat different, especially as the affairs of that kingdom are closely mixed up with those of the great Affairs of earldom of Northumberland. We have seen that, on the rf^ber- fourfold division of England, the great Northern govern- land and ment was entrusted to the Dane Erie, who seems however Scotland. , Earldom not *\u00b0 nave disturbed the actual Jinglisn possessors/ He of Eric; most likely kept a superiority over them till his own banishment,3 after which it is clear that the family of the of Eadwulf former Earls remained in possession. The reigning Earl, Eadwulf, the son of the elder Waltheof and brother of Uhtred, is spoken of as a timid and cowardly man, who, according to one account, now surrendered .Lothian to King Malcolm for fear that he might avenge the victories won over him by his brother.4 But if any cession was made to the Scots at this time, it was most likely Battle of extorted by Malcolm by force of arms. For the second ioigam' year of Cnut was marked by a Scottish invasion and a Scottish victory of unusual importance.5 King Malcolm entered England, accompanied by Eogan or Eugenius, seemingly an Under-king of Strathclyde. A great battle took place at Carham on the Tweed, not far from the scene of the more famous fight of Flodden, in which the Scots gained a decisive victory over the whole force of the Bernician earldom. The slaughter, as usual, fell most heavily upon the English nobility. Bishop Ealdhun is said to have fallen sick on hearing the news, and to have died in a few days. His great work was all but done. The height of Durham was now crowned by a church, stately doubtless after the standard of those times, 1 Ann. Camb. 1035 ; Brut. 1033. 2 See above, p. 379. 3 See above, p. 429. 4 On the Northumbrian Earls see Appendix KK, and on the cession of Lothian see Appendix I. - * On Cnut's relations with Scotland, see Appendix LL."], [497, "BATTLE OF CARHAM. 449 of which only a single tower lacked completion.1 It was ohap. vi. doubtless owing to the confusion which followed the Scot tish inroad that three years passed between the death of Ealdhun and the succession of the next Bishop Eadmund.2 According to one theory, which I shall discuss elsewhere,3 the annexation of Lothian to the Scottish kingdom was the result of this battle. It is equally strange that a prince like Cnut should have consented to the cession of any part of his dominions, and that he should have allowed a Scottish victory to pass unrevenged. But we do not, in our English authorities, find any mention of Scottish affairs till a much later stage of his reign. According to Affairs of the Scottish account, Duncan, the grandson of Malcolm iamj through his daughter Beatrice, who now held the under kingdom of Cumberland or Strathclyde, refused, though often summoned, to do homage to Cnut.4 His refusal was clbked under a show of feudal loyalty; his homage was due only to the lawful King of the English; he would do no kind of service to a Danish usurper. Cnut, after his return from his Roman pilgrimage, marched against his refractory vassal, with the intention of incorporating his dominions with the English kingdom. Certain Bishops Submission j ,, , \u25a0 n t \u2022 j of Duncan. and other chief men stepped in to preserve peace, and a compromise was brought about. Duncan withdrew his claim to independence ; Cnut relinquished his design of complete incorporation ; the Under-king of Cumberland was again to hold his kingdom on the old terms of vassalage. Such is the Scottish story, which character istically puts Cumberland in the foreground, and leaves out all mention both of Scotland proper and of Lothian. It may very likely be true in what it asserts; it is 1 Simeon (Hist. Eccl. Dun. iii. 5); \"De ecclesia quam inceperat solam turrim occidentalem imperfectam reliquit.\" 2 Simeon, Hist. Dun. iii. 6 ; Flor. Wig. 1020. 3 See Appendix I. * See Appendix LLL. VOL. I. G g"], [498, "jT THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. 450 chap. vi. eminently false in what it conceals. For there is no doubt that Cnut's dealings with his northern neighbours were by no means confined to Cumberland, but touched Scotland itself quite as nearly. It is just conceivable that both Duncan and his grandfather Malcolm refused homage to Cnut on the ground that the Dane was an usurper of the English kingdom. If so, they were perhaps brought to reason at an earlier time than would appear from our own Chronicles only. According to a French historian, an expedition of Cnut against the Scots was hindered, and peace was restored, by the in- tercession of the Lady Emma and her brother Duke Richard. According to a Norwegian saga, two Scottish Kings, probably Malcolm and Duncan, submitted to Submission Cnut in the early years of his reign. However all this land. may be, it is certain, on the highest of all authorities, that I031, the whole kingdom of Scotland did in the end submit to his claims. Cnut, like William after him, was not minded to give up any right of the crown which he had won. The more famous ceremony of Abernethy forty [io73] years later was now forestalled. As the younger Malcolm then became the man of the Norman, so now the elder Malcolm became the man of the Dane.1 Cnut, after his return from Rome \u2014 in the very year of his return, accord- ing to those who give the later date to that event \u2014 marched into Scotland, meeting, it would seem, with no Malcolm, opposition.

It seems to be a step Under beyond the terms of the original commendation to Eadward the Elder. It seems to be a step towards the more com plete submission made by William the Lion to Henry the Second and to the homage done by all Scotland to the Lord Paramount Edward. The, choice of the English King as Father and Lord over the King and people of the Scots did not make this or that Scot his \" man.\" x But now, not only King Malcolm, but Jehmarc and Macbeth became the \"men\" of the King of all England. Yet the fact may perhaps be explained another way. When we remember the later history, we shall perhaps be inclined to look for the cause of this change in the slight authority possessed by Malcolm over the lesser Scottish princes. His legendary character paints him as a King who granted away all his domains, and left himself nothing but the hill of Scone, the holy place of the Scottish monarchy.2 And more authentic history shows that Jehmarc and Macbeth, princes ruling on the western and eastern shores of the island, were so far independent of the King of Scots that the homage of Malcolm alone would have been no sufficient guaranty for the retention of the Scottish kingdom in its proper submission to the Imperial crown. Macbeth indeed was the representative of a line which had claims on the Scottish crown itself. Cnut therefore prudently exacted the homage of Malcolm's dangerous vassals as well as that of Malcolm himself. Malcolm, already an old man, survived the ceremony Death of /.Malcolm. only three years, and died in the year before the death of 1034. 1 See above, p. 131, and Appendix G. 2 Fordun, iv. 43 (Gale, p. 686).

Of this prince, afterwards canonized as a saint and martyr, we have heard somewhat already ; 2 but the part assigned to him in English affairs evidently belongs to romance aud not to history. His career in his own country is more authentic and more important. The rule of Olaf was at Reign of first acceptable to the country; but both his virtues and 1015-1028. his faults gradually raised up enemies against him. He was preeminently a reformer. His strictness in the ad ministration of justice, the first of virtues in a prince of those times, is highly praised.3 He was moreover a zealous Christian ; his whole soul was devoted to spreading throughout his kingdom the blessings of religion and civilization, and to reforming the manners and morals of his people in every way. He brought bishops and other churchmen from England, and, not satisfied with the evangelization of his own kingdom, he employed them as missionaries in Sweden, Gothland, and the neighbouring islands.4 But, just like the elder Olaf, his choice of means was often less praiseworthy than the excellence of his objects. The reformer tried by harshness and violence to force on a rude people manners and institutions for which they were not ready, and the Christian missionary sank into a persecutor of those who clave to the creed of their fathers. In his lofty ideas of kingly power, Olaf set little store by the rights either of the ancient chiefs or of the free peasantry of the land, and, in dealing with these 1 See above, p. 379. 2 See above, p. 370, and Appendix W. 3 See Adam of Bremen, ii. 55, and cf.

With the Frankish Emperor Conrad the mighty ruler of Northern Europe was on the best terms. Cnut, as we have seen, made his acquaintance and friend ship in his Imperial capital, and bore a part in the splendours of his Imperial consecration. The alliance was cemented by a treaty of marriage between their children, and by a cession of territory on the part of the potentate higher in formal rank. Gunhild, the daughter of Cnut Marriage and Emma, was betrothed to Conrad's son King Henry, t0 King afterwards the renowned Emperor Henry the Third. The Henry of 1 \u2022> Germany . marriage however did not take place till after the death of I036 the bride's father, and Gunhild, like her predecessor Eadgyth, was destined to be neither the wife nor the mother of an Emperor. Gunhild, like Eadgyth, died before her husband succeeded to the Empire, and his suc cessor was the offspring of his second and better known marriage with Agnes of Poitiers.2 The more strictly political result of the friendship be- Cnut re tween Cnut and Conrad was the restoration of the ancient frontier frontier between Denmark and Germany. After the vie- \u00b0f]lhe torious expedition of Otto the Second into Denmark, a German mark had been established beyond the Eider, extending from that river to the Dannewirk, the great battle is a well attested fact, yet Adam says ; \" Alii dicunt eum in bello peremptum, quidam vero in medio populi circo ad ludibrium magis ex positum.

He was the special friend of Duke William of Aquitaine, surnamed the Great, a prince whose tastes were in many respects congenial with his own. He sent him embassies and gifts, among them a splendid book of devotions in golden letters.1 But Cnut's most important relations among the states of Gaul were with the great duchy which lay opposite to his southern shores, and where his banished step-sons were being brought up as his possible rivals.

The new Duke was, in [997-1 the full sense of the word, a Frenchman.

Richard was the loyal vassal and faithful ally of Friendly the Parisian King ; his friendship with Robert, the second w;th King of that house, seems to have always remained unbroken, f^\u2122' t and the two princes acted together in various expeditions. The Normans were by this time thoroughly naturalized in their Gaulish possessions. In the records of the time they appear as recognized and honoured members of the French monarchy. The memory of their foreign and heathen de scent is forgotten ; their prince is no longer the mere Duke of Pirates,2 whom a loyal Frenchman spoke of as seldom as he could ; the cherished ally of the Parisian King is now spoken of with every respect as the Duke of Rouen.3 The chief French historian of the time is as ready to exaggerate the external power and influence of the second Richard as ever his own Dudo was to exaggerate those of his father.4 Richard, on the other hand, did not hesitate to have his gifts to his own Fecamp confirmed by his over-lord,5 and he dated his public acts by the regnal years of the King.6 1 See above, p. 221. 2 See above, pp. 164, 254. 3 In Rudolf Glaber (ii. 2) Richard appears as \"Rotomagorum dux.\" Duke or Earl of Rouen (Rudu Jarl) is also the title which the Norman princes bear in the Northern Sagas.

Constance, according to Rudolf Glaber (iii. 9), was \"avarissima, maritique magistra.\" The flocking of her southern countrymen to the court of Paris is described by Rudolf in language which reminds one of England under Henry the Third. 2 This Burgundian war is described by R. Glaber, ii. 8 ; Will. Gem. V. 15. The Norman contingent is said to have amounted to 30,000 men. 3 See Sigebert's Chron. 1006 (Pertz, vi. 354), and the Gesta Episc.

His sister Matilda had married Odo the Second, Count of Chartres, the grand son of the old enemy Theobald. The town and part of the district of Dreux had been given to Odo as her marriage portion,2 and this, on her death, he refused to give back. A War with war followed, which was made conspicuous by the foundation chartres. of the famous castle of Tillieres,3 which long remained a border fortress of Normandy. Of course every effort of Odo to take or surprise the Norman outpost was rendered hopeless by Norman valour, and yet we are told that Richard found it expedient to resort to help of a very questionable kind to support him against his enemy. The Normans were now Frenchmen ; Duke Richard and his court of gentlemen 4 had doubtless quite forgotten their Scandinavian mother-tongue ; some traces of the old nationality may still have lingered at Bayeux, but, as a whole, Normandy was now French in language, feeling, and religion. But the old connexion with the North was still cherished. We have already seen how the friendly reception which the Danish invaders of England met with in the Norman ports had led to hostile relations between Normandy and England.5 So now we have the old story of Harold Blaatand over again.6 Richard, like his father, does not scruple to bring heathen invaders into Gaul to help him against his Christian enemies. 1 W.

And, just as in the second appearance of Harold Blaatand, this shameful help is called in at a time when there seems to be no need for it, at a time when the Norman arms are completely victorious. Odo could surely have been crushed by the combined forces of Normandy and Britanny,1 even if King Robert was not disposed to repay in kind the services of his loyal vassal. The tale how ever, as we find it, represents the Norman Duke as entering into a league with two heathen Kings, who were engaged in inflicting the most cruel ravages on his own vassals and allies of Britanny, having just taken and burned the frontier city of Dol.2 These Kings are de scribed as Lacman of Sweden and Olaf of Norway. With regard to the former there must be a mistake of some kind, as no King bearing any such name occurs in Swedish history.

Nothing can be plainer than that both William and Wace meant their Olaf for Olaf Haraldsson, as they speak of his subsequent martyrdom. Mr. Thorpe adds, \" Lagman is the name of an office. Angl. lawman.\" So it is, and names of offices, from Pharaoh onwards, have often been mistaken for proper names ; but would a King, specially a King of the sea, be called a Lawman ? Lagman too is a real Scandinavian name. Lagman, Harold, and Olaf appear as brothers in the history of Man (Chron. Man. 4. ed. Munch, A. 1075.)

Peace was made by the mediation of the King ; Count Odo kept his town of Dreux, and Duke Richard kept his new fortress of Tillieres. The heathen Kings were to be got rid of as they might.

The alliance between Richard the Good and King Robert had caused the Norman arms to be felt and dreaded throughout the length and breadth of Gaul. -But now the limits both of the Norman duchy and of the French kingdom became too narrow for the energies both of the sovereigns of Normandy and of their subjects. The part played by the Normans in Europe had hitherto been partly defensive and partly secondary. They had withstood French, English, and German invasions, and they had aided their lords, ducal and royal, at Paris in a variety of military adventures. But now that no invader was to be feared, now that the Norman state held a fully established position in France and in Europe, the old Scandinavian spirit of distant enterprise and distant conquest awoke again. The Christian and French-speaking Norman was now as ready to jeopard his life and fortune in distant lands as ever his heathen and Scandinavian forefathers had been.

As yet no distant conquest had been undertaken by any Norman Duke. Yet even under Richard the Good we find the power of Normandy em- ployed beyond the bounds of the French kingdom, and in a cause which was not that of any immediate interest of the Norman duchy. Besides the campaign in which Duke Richard vindicated the claim of his over-lord over the ducal Burgundy, he carried his arms beyond the frontier of the Western Kingdom into that further Bur- gundy which still kept its own line of Kings, and which was soon to return to its allegiance to C\u00e6sar.

Towards the end of Richard's reign. this prince fell into the hands of his turbulent neighbour, Hugh, Count of Challon 1 and Bishop of Auxerre. Hugh was a vassal of France, while Reginald's dominions were held in fief of the last Burgundian King, the feeble Rudolf, himself little better than a vassal of the Emperor. But neither King nor C\u00e6sar stepped forward to chastise the wrong-doer or to set free the captive.

Spain had long before attracted the sPilln attention of a Norman sovereign ; it was to Spain, as a heathen land, to which Richard the Fearless had per suaded the unbelieving portion of his Scandinavian allies to depart.1 It was in Spain, as the battle-ground of Christian and Saracen, that Roger now sought at once to wage warfare against the misbeliever and to carve out a dominion for himself. Roger was of the noblest blood of Normandy, boasting a descent from Malahulc, uncle of Rolf,2 and he may well have looked down upon the upstart gentlemen whose nobility had no higher source than the tardy bridal of their kinswoman Gunnor.3 Roger fought manfully against the infidels, and marvellous tales are told of his daring, his hard-won victories, his deeds of cannibal ferocity.4 He married the daughter of the widowed Countess of Barcelona, a princess whose dominions were practically Spanish, though her formal allegiance was due to the Parisian King.

One can hardly doubt that the wonder ful successes of their countrymen in the South of Europe did much to suggest to the minds of those Normans who stayed at home that a still greater conquest nearer home was not wholly hopeless. The unsuccessful attempt of Duke Robert, which we shall presently have to mention, and the successful attempt of his greater son, may well have been partly suggested by the exploits of the sons of Tancred in Apulia. When private adventurers thus grew into sovereigns, what might not be done by the sovereign of Normandy himself, wielding the whole force of the land which gave birth to men like them ? For it must be re membered that the Norman conquest of Apulia was no national enterprise, no conquest made in regular warfare waged by the Duke of the Normans against any other potentate. Private Norman adventurers, pilgrims return ing from the Holy Land, Norman subjects under the displeasure of their own Duke,1 gentlemen of small estate whom the paternal acres could no longer maintain, gradually deprived the Roman Empire of the East2 of the remnant of its Western possessions, and won back the greatest of Mediterranean islands from the dominion of Mahomet to that of Christ.

But when we tweenCnut andRobert. ask for dates and details, we are at once plunged into every kind of confusion and contradiction. The English writers are silent; from the German writers we learn next to nothing ; the Scandinavian history of this age is still at least half mythical ; the Norman writers never held truth to be of any moment when the relations of Normandy and England were concerned. That Robert provoked Cnut by threats or attempts to restore the \u00c6thelings, and also by ill-treating and repudiating Cnut's sister, seem to be facts which we may accept in the bare outline, whatever we say as to their minuter details. That Cnut retaliated by an invasion of Normandy, or that the threat of such an invasion had an effect on the conduct of the sovereigns of Normandy, are positions which are strongly asserted by various authorities. But their stories are accompanied exspirasset.\" Even here there is a confusion between Henry's coronation and his restoration by Robert,"], [520, "THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. 472 chap. vi. by circumstances which directly contradict the witness of authorities which are far more trustworthy. In fact, the moment we get beyond the range of the sober contem- porary Chronicles of Our own land, we find ourselves in a region in which the mythical and romantic elements outweigh the historical, and moreover, in whatever comes from Norman sources, we have to be on our guard against interested invention as well as against honest error. Marriages We have seen that Estrith, a sister of Cnut, was married withljif to the Danish Earl Ulf, the brother-in-law of Godwine, and Robert, fo wuom she bore the famous Swegen Estrithson, after- wards King of the Danes, one of the most renowned princes in Danish history. We are told by a crowd of authorities that, besides her marriage with Ulf, Estrith was married to the Duke of the Normans, that she was ill-treated by him in various ways, and was finally sent back with ignominy to her brother. Most of the writers who tell this story place this marriage before her marriage with Ulf, and make the Danish Earl take the divorced Supposed wife of the Norman Duke. With this story several writers tweenCnut connect another story of an invasion, or threatened in- andRobert. vas;0Ilj 0f Normandy undertaken by Cnut in order to redress his sister's wrongs. The most popular Danish writer even makes Cnut die, in contradiction to all authentic history, while besieging Rouen. We read also how the Norman Duke fled to Jerusalem or elsewhere for fear of the anger of the lord of six Northern kingdoms. Details of this kind are plainly mythical ; but they point to some real quarrel, to some war, threatened if not actually waged, between Cnut and Robert. And chronology, as well as the tone of the legends, shows that the whole of these events must be placed quite late in Cnut's reign. Robert The natural inference is that the marriage between Robert rnarrted7 anCl Estrith took place, not before Estrith's marriage Estrith witn Ulf, but after Ulf 's death.

A superior attraction c. 1026. nearer his own castle may easily account for Robert's neglect of his Scandinavian bride, a bride no doubt many years older than the young Count of Hiesmes. Within three years after Estrith's widowhood, Robert became the father of him who was preeminently the Bastard.1 It seems impossible to doubt that Robert's intervention Robert's on behalf of his English cousins was connected with these tion on be. events.

Robert in English affairs must have been in Cnut's later days. Each prince would doubtless seize every opportunity of annoying the other ; the tale clearly sets Robert before us as the aggressor ; but as to the order of events we are left to guess. It would be perfectly natural, in a man of Robert's character, if the repudiation of Estrith was accompanied, or presently followed, by the assertion of the claims of the \u00c6thelings to her brother's crown. The date then of the first contemplated Norman invasion of England can be fixed only within a few years ; but the story, as we read it in the Norman accounts, seems credible enough in its general outline.2 The Duke sends an embassy to Cnut, demanding, it would seem, the cession of the whole king dom of England to the rightful heir. That Cnut refused to surrender his crown is nothing wonderful, though the Norman writer seems shocked that the exhortation of the Norman ambassadors did not at once bring conviction to the mind of the usurper.3 The Duke then, in great wrath, Robert's determines to assert the claims of his kinsmen by force of ful attempt 1 On these events and on those which follow, see Appendix PPP. 2 See Appendix NNN. 8 Will.

An assembly of the Normans is held, a forerunner of the more famous assembly at Lillebonne, in which the invasion of England is determined on. A fleet is made ready with all haste, and Duke Robert and the \u00c6theling Eadward embark at Fecamp. But the wind was con trary; instead of being carried safely to Pevensey, the fleet was carried round the Cotentin and found itself on the coast of Jersey.1 All attempts were vain; the historian piously adds that they were frustrated by a special Pro vidence, because God bad determined that his servant Eadward should make his way to the English crown without the shedding of blood.2 The Duke accordingly gave up his enterprise on behalf of his cousin of England, and employed his fleet in a further harrying of the domi nions of his cousin of Britanny.3 At last Robert, Arch bishop of Rouen, the common uncle of Robert and Alan,4 reconciled the two princes, and the fleet seems now to have sailed to Rouen.5 Thus far we have a story, somewhat heightened in its details, but which may be taken as evidence that Robert, who had restored the fugitive sove reigns of France and Flanders, really thought of carry- CHAP.

Sir F. Palgrave (iii. 1 76) remarks that this is the first time that Jersey is spoken of in medi\u00e6val history. Wace (7937) seems to have thought that a special description of the position of his native island was needed ; \"Gersui est prez de Costentin, En mer est devers Occident, La u Normendie prent fin ; Al fie de Normendie appent.\" 2 Will.

Cnut, with no Tostig, no Harold Hardrada, to divert him from the main danger, and with the force of his other kingdoms ready to back him, would most likely have speedily crushed the invader. But had it been otherwise, one can hardly fancy that the results of the English expedition would have been of as little moment as the results of the French and the Flemish expedition. In France and Flanders Robert had simply turned the scale between two princes of the same house. But if a Norman army had set one of the sons of \u00c6thelred on the English throne, the result would have been something more than a mere personal change of sovereign. Had Eadward held his crown by virtue of a victory won by Norman troops over Cnut's Danes and Englishmen, the practical aspect of such a revolution could have hardly differed at all from the revolution which did take place under William. The prince thus established in his kingdom would have been, according to formal pedigrees, the cyne-hlaford, the de scendant of \u00c6lfred, Cerdic, and Woden. But half-Norman by birth, wholly Norman in feeling, raised to his throne by Norman swords, Eadward would have reigned still more thoroughly as a Frenchman than he did reign when, a few years later, he came to the crown in a more peace able way. The storm, or whatever it was, which kept back Duke Robert from his invasion of England, put off the chances of a Norman Conquest for nearly forty years."], [524, "476 THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. The Norman writers wind up their story with an asser tion which is much less credible than their account of the expedition itself. Robert, on his return from his Breton expedition, was met in the very nick of time 1 by ambas sadors from Cnut offering half of the kingdom of England to the sons of \u00c6thelred. The lord of Northern Europe was sick, and felt himself near his end ; he therefore wished for peace during the remnant of his days.2 Of course this is not to be understood as an offer of an immediate sur render of any part of his dominions. What is meant is that Cnut offered to secure peace with Normandy by acknowledging Eadward as his successor in the kingdom of Wessex. The Norman and the Danish accounts may be set one against another. Any number of embassies may have passed between the two princes; any amount of mutual threatenings may have been exchanged ; but Cnut's fear of Robert and Robert's fear of Cnut may be set aside as equally mythical. The Norman story is utterly improbable. Nothing could be more unlikely than a disposition made by Cnut in favour of either of his step sons. He could have no personal motive for alienating any portion of his dominions from his own children. In almost any other case the influence of his wife would supply a natural and sufficient motive for such an arrange ment. But all that we hear of Emma leads us to believe that her whole heart was set on Harthacnut and Gunhild, and that she was not at all likely to use her influence on behalf of her sons by \u00c6thelred.

But among all the disputes which followed on the death of Cnut, we hear not a word of the claims of the \u00c6thelings, we hear nothing of any single voice raised in their favour.1 Still that tale may have been the distortion of something which really happened. We must not forget that Hartha cnut was Robert's cousin no less than Eadward. It may be that some announcement or confirmation of Cnut's intentions in his favour, as opposed to the succession of Harold or Swegen, may have been made by Cnut to the Norman Duke. Such an announcement might easily have been mistaken by Norman writers, ill-informed about English affairs, for a disposition in savour of another son of Emma. Whatever the relations between Cnut and Robert may Deaths of ...... o -nri Cnut and have been, the two princes died in the same year. When Robert. Cnut made his pilgrimage to Rome, religious motives were doubtless the leading cause of his journey. But the politic King knew how to make use of the errand which was to profit his soul in order to advance at once his own power and credit and the interests of the many nations over which he ruled. A fit of purer religious enthusiasm, a fierce impulse of penitence for past sins, carried Robert of Normandy on the more distant pil grimage to Jerusalem.3 On his return he died at the 1 It will be seen that I do not look on a single expression of William of Malmesbury (ii. 188) as evidence enough to prove the existence of a party in England in favour of the \u00c6thelings. 3 Robert died in 1035.

The two rivals, if rivals they were, passed from the Western world almost at the same moment ; the death of Cnut happened about the time when the death of Robert must have become known in England and in Normandy. The dominions of both rulers passed away to their spurious or doubtful offspring. The son of Herleva succeeded in Normandy; the supposed son of \" the other \u00c6lfgifu \" succeeded in England.

The Scan- England was the seat of his own dominion, while the States Scandinavian kingdoms were entrusted to Viceroys or Under3-7 Under-kings.

In both countries we see signs of disaffection towards Cnut's government, while we see none such in England. The rule of Swegen and his mother is said to have been highly oppressive in Norway. In Denmark we even hear of an attempt, headed by Earl Ulf and said to be favoured by Queen Emma, to displace Cnut in favour of Harthacnut. The reason assigned is the preference shown Impossi- by Cnut to England and Englishmen.

The process of their formation may, as chap. vi. in the cases of Alexander and Charles, leave results behind I>lre3 ln general. it which affect the whole later history of the world ; but the Empires themselves are ephemeral. As united dominions, swayed by a single will, they last only as long as there, is an Alexander or a Charles at their head ; they fall to pieces as soon as the sceptre of the great conqueror passes into weaker hands. So it was with the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire of the great Cnut. With our scanty knowledge, we cannot positively either assert or deny that he dreamed of preserving any kind of union among his vast and widely severed dominions. If he did Cnut's entertain such thoughts, his designs were scattered to carried out. the winds immediately upon his own death. When he died, Swegen was in possession of Norway, and Harthacnut in possession of Denmark. It appears that England also was designed for the son of Emma, Cnut's specially royal offspring, the one son who was the child of a crowned King and his Lady. What provision, if any, was made for Harold by his father's last dispositions does not appear. But things turned out far otherwise than Cnut had intended. Swegen was almost immediately driven out Swegen of Norway, and Magnus, the son of Saint Olaf, was re- fro^ ceived as King. In Denmark Harthacnut kept possession, Norway. though the aspect of Magnus was threatening. In Eng land, as usual, all attempts to influence the free choice of the Witan before the vacancy came to nothing. If Cnut tried to do more than exercise that vague power of recommending a successor which the law vested in him, his bequest went for as little as the older bequest of \u00c6thelwulf had gone.1 The events which immediately followed the death of State of Cnut are told with much contradiction and confusion ; on the but, by closely attending to the most trustworthy authori- ce^t of 1 See above, p. 109.

That the English were divided, some being for Harthacnut and some for one of the sons of \u00c6thelred, is a statement which seems hardly to rest on sufficient authority.2 On the other hand, Harold, the supposed son of Cnut and of \u00c6lfgifu of Northampton, also appeared as a candidate. Northum- He seems to have been supported by Earl Leofric of Mercia.and Mercia, by the great body of the thegns north of the Harold. f\u00b0r Thames, and by the \" lithsmen,\" the sea-faring folk, of London. It would even seem that he ventured on a daring act, whether we call it an act of sovereignty or Harold of violence, before the election was held. He sent to Emma. Winchester and despoiled the Lady \u00c6lfgifu-Emma of the treasures which had been left her by Cnut.3 Person ally, as the event proved, both candidates were equally worthless; but each had strong political motives on his side, and it is clear that men's passions were deeply stirred by the struggle. As far as we can see, Harold was the candidate of the North, Harthacnut of the South ; Harold was the candidate of the Danes, Harthacnut of Apparent the English. At first sight this division of parties motives of .... the two seems exactly opposite to what might have been expected. parties. 1 On the disputed election between Harold and Harthacnut, see Appendix RRR. 2 See above, p. 477, and Appendix RRR. 3 The accounts in the Abingdon and Worcester Chronicles, the only copies which mention the seizure, would seem to imply that it took place while Harold was still only a candidate for the Crown. Florence (in anno) indeed says, \" Is tamen, adepta regia dignitate, misit Wintoniam suos con stipatores celerrime, et gazarum opumque quas rex Canutus Algiv\u00e6 reli querat regin\u00e6 majorem melioremque partem ademit illi tyrannice.\" So Roger of Wendover, i. 473. But Harold could hardly have ventured on this after the peaceful division of the kingdom, and this business is quite different from Harold's expulsion of Emma in 1037, though it is confounded with it by Roger."], [531, "CANDIDATURE OF HAROLD AND HARTHACNUT. 483 Harthacnut, the son of a Danish father and a Norman chap. vi. mother, had not a drop of English blood in his veins. Harold, if he was what he professed to be, the son of Cnut by the other \u00c6lfgifu, was English at least by the mother's side ; if he was what scandal asserted him to be, the son of a shoemaker by some nameless mother, he was doubtless English on both sides. The election of Harthacnut involved the continuation of the connexion with Denmark; the election of Harold would again make England an independent and isolated kingdom. Yet English feeling lay with Harthacnut, Danish feeling lay with Harold. The explanation is probably to be found Attach in the personal position of Cnut towards his West-Saxon the West subjects. He had lived more habitually among them g^rtha- \u00b0 than among the people of any other part of his dominions ; cnut \"* the the greatest of living Englishmen had been his minister and Cnut. representative; he had in every way made Wessex his home, and Wessex had flourished under his government as it had never flourished before. It was no wonder then if the wishes of Cnut with regard to the succession or to anything else were looked on by the West-Saxon people as a sacred law. Harthacnut too, if not the de scendant of their ancient rulers, was at least a kingly bairn, the son of a crowned King and his Lady. Who was Harold the bastard, whose parents no one knew for certain, that he should rule over them? If Hartha cnut was at this moment in Denmark, his earliest days had been spent in England, while we have seen reason to believe that the earliest days of Harold had been spent in Denmark. The continued connexion with Denmark which Aspect of was implied in the choice of Harthacnut might even nexionwith appear to patriotic Englishmen as an argument in favour r,enmar \u25a0 of the Danish King.1 In the later days of Cnut the 1 I believe there were people who, on the accession of the present Queen, regretted the separation between England and Hannover. i i 3"], [532, "THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. 484 connexion with Denmark had taken a form which must have been distinctly gratifying to English, and above all to West-Saxon, national feeling. The lord of all Northern Europe had worn his Imperial crown in the old West-Saxon capital ; he had thence sent forth his earls and his sons to govern his dependent realms of Denmark and Norway. As it had been in the days of Cnut, so men deemed that it would be in the days of Harthacnut. Denmark, like Mercia or Northumberland, would be only another earldom whence homage, and perhaps tribute, would be paid to the Imperial court and the Imperial treasure-house at Winchester. The sons of \u00c6thelred were strangers ; no man in England had seen them since their childhood ; their claims had been made the pretext for a threatened foreign invasion ; no sentiment attaching to their remoter ancestry could at all counterbalance the sentiment which attached to the undoubted, the royal, the chosen, son of the King who had given England eighteen years of peace, pros perity, and foreign dominion. West-Saxon feeling there fore took the shape of loyalty to the undoubted son of the late King, of obedience to his declared wishes as to the succession. Earl Godwine and all the men of his earldom were for Harthacnut. CHAP. VI. On the other hand, it is not hard to see how Harold might appeal to a very intelligible line of feeling in the minds of the Danish and half-Danish inhabitants of Northern England. His bastardy would in their eyes be no objection. Whether we look on his mother as a mere concubine or as bound to Cnut by an irregular or un canonical marriage, her children would, according to Danish notions, be as fit to reign as the children of the Norman Lady. Indeed a powerful vein of Northumbrian sentiment might not unnaturally attach to the grandson of the murdered Earl \u00c6lfhelm.

Danes and Angles ; a day might seem to be coming in which Winchester would have to bow to York. And if the son of \u00c6lfgifu thus had a local connexion with North - humberland, he had also a local connexion with Mercia. Whether by birth, by residence, or by maternal descent, the daughter of \u00c6lfhelm was in some way \u00c6lfgifu of Northampton, and her son might call on Mercian local feeling to support the claims of a countryman. Again, if Harold, after having been designed for the crown of Denmark and brought up in Denmark as a future Danish King, had been deprived by his father's later arrangements of any share in either England or Denmark, Danish and Northumbrian feelings would centre round him still more strongly. He would become the embodiment of any jealousies which had been called forth by Cnut's open preference of England to Denmark, by his preference of the Saxon part of England to the Anglian and Danish lands. It was better to have a King who should reign over England without Denmark, better to have a King who should reign over Northumberland and Mercia with out Wessex, than for a West-Saxon King, of whatever ancestry, to hold both Northumberland and Denmark as dependencies. The old provincial feelings, often con cealed but never completely stifled, ever ready to break out on any strong provocation, now broke out in their fulness. The Danish provinces sided with Harold. And with them we find a new element, the \" lithsmen,\" the nautie mul titude of London.

We hear now, not of the citizens, but of the sea-faring men.1 Every invasion, every foreign settlement of any kind within the kingdom, has in every age added 1 See Appendix RRR."], [534, "THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. 486 a new element to the population of London. As a Nor man colony settled in London later in the century, so a Danish colony settled there now. Some accounts tell us, doubtless with great exaggeration, that London had now almost become a Danish city.1 But it is certain that the Danish element in the city was numerous and powerful, and that its voice strongly helped to swell the cry in favour of Harold. Northumberland, Mercia, and London thus demanded that the son of \u00c6lfgifu of Northampton should, if possible, be King over all England ; in the worst case they would have him, like Eadgar and like Cnut, for King over all Northumberland and Mercia. CHAP. VI. There was perhaps no country except England in which such a question could have been settled in that age other wise than at the cost of a civil war.

The usual midwinter meeting may, or may not, have been forestalled by a few weeks ; certain it is that, soon after the death of Cnut, the Witan of all England met in full Gemot at Oxford. That town was, no doubt, on this as on other occasions, recommended for the purpose by its position on the frontiers of the two great divisions of the kingdom. The national council proceeded to debate the claims of the two candidates.

If this tale be true, it was an assertion of independence on the part of the ecclesiastical power for which we might in vain seek a parallel in the English history of those times. \u00c6thelnoth, as a member of the Gemot, might give his vote for whichever candidate he thought good ; but when the election was once made, he had clearly no right as Archbishop to refuse to consecrate the King chosen by the majority. But the tale is most likely a fiction. There seems to be little doubt that Harold was regularly crowned at Oxford by \u00c6thelnoth, either now or after his later election to the whole kingdom.1 But, if the tale be true, and if it belongs to this time, it plainly implies the Imperial supre macy of Harold.

It was in the course of the next year that an event happened of which advantage has ever since been taken by hostile tongues and pens to stain the character of the great Earl of the West-Saxons with a charge of the blackest treachery. But even in the period on which we are now entering, a period in which we have at every step to weigh the conflicting statements of national and political partizanship, there is no event as to which the various versions of the tale are more utterly at variance with each other. The story is told with every conceivable variety of time, place, and person, and even our earliest and best authorities contain statements which cannot be reconciled with one another. Thus much seems certain ; first, that, Attempt about this time, one or both of the sons of \u00c6thelred andoftne Emma made an attempt to recover their father's kingdom; \u00c6thelings. secondly, that \u00c6lfred, the younger of the two \u00c6thelings, fell into the power of Harold and was cruelly put to death ; thirdly, that Godwine was suspected of being an accom plice.

As he went onwards into the country, Godwine met him, received him friendly, and seemingly did homage to him.3 The Earl and the \u00c6theling supped together, and talked over their plans.

VI. There is yet quite another version, that of the special panegyrist of Emma, according to whom, it must be re membered, Eadward and \u00c6lfred are not sons of \u00c6thelred, but younger sons of Cnut and Emma, sent over to Nor mandy for education.2 Harold, anxious to destroy his half-brothers, forges a letter to them in the name of their mother. She tells them that she is Lady only in name ; Harold has usurped the kingdom and is daily strength ening himself; he is winning over the chief men by gifts, threats, and prayers. Yet the feeling of the nation is still in their favour rather than in that of Harold. Let one of her sons come over to her quickly and secretly; she can then consult with him what is to be done.3 The \u00c6thelings fell into the snare ; \u00c6lfred, the younger of the brothers, went with a few comrades into Flanders ; there he stayed a short time with the Marquess Baldwin, and increased his company by some adventurers from Boulogne.4 He then set sail, and came near to some point of the English coast which is not further described. But, as the inhabitants came down to the shore with evidently hostile intentions, he changed his course to another point equally undeter mined. There he landed, and tried to go to his mother ; on the way he was met by Godwine, who swore oaths to Harold forges a letter froi Emma to the \u00c6thelings, 1 \"At the west end, near the steeple, in the south portice.\" This makes one think that the present arrangements of the west front of Ely reproduce something far earlier. 2 See Appendix BBB. 3 The letter is given at length in the Encomium Emm\u00e6, iii. 3.

We are here on the dangerous ground of martyrology, and we must be on our guard against the evident wish, shown in all such cases, to make the sufferings of \u00c6lfred follow the pattern of the sufferings of Christ. Possibly too, in the language about these judges, whoever they were, we may discern an allusion to Saint Paul's precept, 1 Cor. vi. 4."], [542, "494 THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. state of the case was. The unhappy fate of \u00c6lfred caused him, according to the universal English instinct, to be looked on as a martyr ; his tale became a piece of hagiology, to which, as to other pieces of hagiology, ordinary ways of thinking were not to be applied. This way of looking at the matter began very early; but, in order really to get to the bottom of the question, we must try and understand how things must have looked at the moment of \u00c6lfred's landing. CHAP. VI. First of all, whatever was the crime either of Godwine or of Harold, we must remember that, in any case, it was not the kind of crime which the exaggerated language of some of our narratives would lead us to think. God wine might be a traitor in the sense of. one who betrays any fellow-creature to his ruin ; on the worst showing, he was not a traitor in the sense of one who betrays or rebels against his lawful sovereign. \u00c6lfred was not, as the legends of his martyrdom might seem to imply, a lawful King driven from his throne. Harold was not an usurper, keeping the lawful heir out of his lawful pos session. Godwine was not a rebel, conspiring to betray a prince to whom his allegiance was lawfully due. Ac cording to any version of the story, \u00c6lfred appeared in England as the enemy of a settled government, established by a regular vote of the legislature. As such it was the part and duty of the King, of the Earl, and of the whole people, to resist him. He was a pretender to the crown entering the kingdom at the head of a foreign force, whether great or small. There has never been any time or place in which such a pretender would not have been at once arrested ; there have been few times and places in which such a pretender would not have been speedily put to death. Against the arrest of \u00c6lfred not a word can be said in any age ; his execution was perhaps more deeply offensive to the public feeling of the eleventh Statement of the case."], [543, "REAL POSITION OF \u00c6LFRED. 495 century, a time when the shedding of blood by the sen- chap. vi. tence of law was singularly rare,1 than it would have been to the public feeling of the fifteenth or the sixteenth century. The real question is whether either the arrest or the execution was accompanied with any circumstances of treachery or needless cruelty. The sons of \u00c6thelred were \u00c6lfred's very much in the position of the elder and younger Pre- analogous tenders in the reigns of George the Eirst and Second. *\u00b0 *\u00a3at In both cases the power which had a right to dispose of Stewart the crown had disposed of it, and had not disposed of it in ders. their favour. Now no man could have blamed any officer, civil or military, in the service of King George, for arrest ing either James or Charles Edward Stewart. In so doing he would simply have been doing his duty to his King and country. If either Pretender had been arrested, his execution would doubtless have been a very harsh measure ; but it would have been a perfectly legal measure ; he was attainted, and he might have been as regularly executed as Monmouth was. Nay, the letter of the law, as the law stood till the reign of George the Third, as it was actually enforced as late as the reign of Charles the Second, would have condemned the pretended Prince of Wales to in dignities and torments quite as cruel as any that Harold Harefoot inflicted on the \u00c6theling and his companions.2 To have put James or Charles Stewart to death in the horrible form which the law decreed for the traitor would doubtless have called forth as fierce a storm of righteous indignation as was called forth by the death of the \u00c6theling \u00c6lfred. Still the act would have been legal ; it might have inflicted undying shame on the King and his counsellors who ordered it, but it would have been no 1 Our history gives us several examples of murders, and of murders left unpunished.

So it was with the case of \u00c6lfred. According to one account, first Eadward and then \u00c6lfred entered the land at the head of a foreign army ; they tried, in short, to repeat the exploit of Cnut, to forestall the exploit of William. In banished men, eager for a re storation to their country on any terms, such conduct may admit of many excuses. Still, on the face of it, they put themselves in the position of open enemies of their country. If Eadward really landed at the head of a Norman army, if he really fought a battle against an English force at Southampton, those who withstood him were as plainly doing their simple duty as the men who fought at Maldon or on Senlac. Even if we reject this version, if we believe that \u00c6lfred entered the country, not with an army but with a mere escort of strangers, still he was coming, seemingly without any invitation from any party in the country, to disturb a settlement which the legislature of the kingdom had established, and which he was not likely to upset except by force of arms. Men who run such desperate risks must take the consequences. The real If Godwine, as a military commander, fought against question -n i -i -p ---i as to God- Eadward, if, as a civil magistrate, he arrested \u00c6lfred, he Was he simply did his duty and nothing else. The only question guilty of would be, as I before put it, Was there any treachery or treachery L j j or needless needless cruelty in the matter ? Now cruelty is perhaps of all charges that which most needs to be looked at with reference to the habits and feelings of the age. What one age looks on as mildness another age looks on as barbarity. But it is clear that the cruelties which were wrought by Harold on his captives deeply revolted the public opinion of the time in which he lived. As for deliberate treachery, that is a crime in all ages alike. If then we set aside accusations which rest on mere misconception of the case, the question remains whether the evidence is enough"], [545, "REAL POSITION OF GODWINE. 497 to convict Godwine either of personal treachery towards chap. vi. the \u00c6theling or of any share in the savage cruelties of Harold. Now in reading any version of the story one great Incon j-a* i \u2022 \u2022 sistency difhcuf ty at once presents itself. Godwine is always of the described as acting a part which, in his real position at gtor'y'with the time, he cannot have acted. Not one of the versions the fact ot the of the tale takes any notice of the division of the kingdom, division They all seem to look on Harold as sole King and to look Kingdom. on Godwine as his minister, or at least as his subject. Yet we know that, at this time, Godwine was neither Harold's minister nor Harold's subject. Harthacnut was still the acknowledged King, at all events King-elect, of the West-Saxons ; Emma was still sitting at Winchester as regent in his name ; Godwine, who had secured for them this remnant of dominion, was the chief minister and general of the Lady and her son. If Godwine acted in any way in the interest of Harold, it could only have been because Harold was, as I suggested above, the superior lord of his own sovereign \u2014 because the invasion, or attempt of whatever kind, made by the \u00c6thelings threatened not only the rights of the King of the West-Saxons, but also the rights of the Emperor of Britain. This is certainly possible, but it is rather straining a point ; nothing of the sort is at all implied in the language of any of the writers who tell the tale. They all, even the best informed, seem to know nothing of the kingship of Harthacnut and the regency of Emma. This seeming ignorance of writers, some of them contemporary, on such a point shows in the most remarkable way how soon and how completely the first ephemeral reign of Harthacnut was forgotten. But their forgetfulness certainly goes a good way to lessen the trust- worthiness of their own tale. In fact the story as it stands cannot be made to agree with the known facts of the history. Godwine cannot have played the part attributed VOL. i. K k"], [546, "498 THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. to him by his enemies while the arrangement decreed by the Witenagemot of Oxford was still in force. But the historical character of that arrangement is undoubted. That the kingdom really was divided, that Godwine really was at this time not the minister of Harold but the minister of Harthacnut, are facts which cannot be gain sayed. The details of the story of \u00c6lfred cannot have happened in the manner and at the time in which they are said to have happened. It was perhaps a feeling of this inconsistency which led several later writers to shift the story to a later time, to the time immediately fol lowing the death, not of Cnut, but of either Harold or Harthacnut. But the part played by Harold is the most essential part of the story; the tale cannot be fitted in to a later time except by a complete change of its circum stances. Altogether I think it must be allowed that the direct evidence brought to implicate Godwine in any guilty share in the business altogether breaks down. CHAP. VI. The direct evidence against Godwine fails. On the other hand, we have to explain the fact that GodwTine was suspected, that the suspicion arose early and prevailed extensively, and that it was not confined to Godwine's foreign enemies and slanderers. Godwine in deed was not the only person who was suspected. One tale or legend accused Emma herself; another laid the guilt to the charge of Lyfing, Bishop of Devonshire, a prelate who often appears as a powerful supporter of Godwine's policy ; in another version, if Godwine was the instigator, the English people in general seem to have been his accomplices.1 Still Godwine was specially suspected, and suspected while the memory of the event was still fresh. His own special apologist and panegyrist seems to imply that the charge against him was a mere invention of the Norman Archbishop Robert.2 This however was not the ease ; Godwine was formally accused and formally acquitted Early suspicions against Godwine. 1 See Appendix SSS. 2 Vita Eadw. 401. See Appendix SSS."], [547, "QUESTION AS TO GODWINE'S CONDUCT. 499 of the crime soon after the accession of Harthacnut, four chap. vi. years after the event. He was acquitted, as we shall [I04\u00b0-] presently see,1 by the solemn judgement of the highest court in the realm, and he is fully entitled to the benefit of that acquittal. Still the mere fact of his accusation has to be explained. The charge, brought at such a time and in such a shape, could not have been a mere Norman slander. Godwine's accuser, in fact, was an Englishman of the highest rank. Nor would a mere Norman slander ever have been embodied in popular songs, or have found a place in any version of the English Chronicles. Such Some a suspicion \u2014 strong, early, native \u2014 proves something. for the Godwine, guilty or innocent, must have done some act which, to say the least, was capable of an unlucky mis- supposed. construction. By putting together one or two hints in the different accounts, we may perhaps come to a probable conjecture as to what his share in the matter really was. There is one version, and only one, which, while consistent with Godwine's innocence, explains the early and prevalent suspicion as to his guilt. Let us look how things stood. It seems that the feeling which broke out openly in the Probable next year was already beginning to show itself ; men were the case. beginning, even in Wessex, to be weary of the absent Harthacnut. Well they might; to wait so long for an absent King, who, still uncrowned, unsworn, unanointed, could not be looked on as full King, was something of which no man had seen the like. It was not wonderful if popular feeling was, as we are told, veering round, whether wrongfully or not, in favour of Harold.2 At such a moment, a son of \u00c6thelred, either knowing the state of the kingdom or eager to try his chance in any case, lands in England. We of course dismiss the story which speaks 1 See below, p. 514. 2 Chronn. \" ForSan hit hleo'Srode pa swiSe toward Haraldes, peh bit unriht w\u00e6re.\" K k 2"], [548, "THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. 500 of actual invasion and warfare, which is probably a mere repetition of the attempted invasion by Duke Robert. But the \u00c6theling was in England; if Godwine really wished to preserve the settlement which gave Wessex to a son of Emma, it might well occur to him to ask whether the game could not be better played with the present son of \u00c6thelred than with the absent son of Cnut. He may have sought an interview with the \u00c6theling ; he may even have pledged himself to his cause. But if a son of \u00c6thelred was at large in England, the throne of Harold would be endangered as well as the throne of Harthacnut. Harold and his emissaries would be on the alert. The prince who had, perhaps before his election, seized on Emma's treasures at Winchester, wrould not, in such a case, be very scrupulous about respecting the frontiers of his brother's kingdom. Perhaps, if he were superior lord, he might have a real right to interfere in a matter which clearly touched the interests of the whole Empire. At any rate, if the \u00c6theling and his companions were known to be lodged in a West-Saxon town not very far from the borders of the Northern kingdom, it is perfectly conceiv able that they might be seized by the agents of Harold, against the will or without the knowledge of Godwine. When the \u00c6theling was once seized and carried off, Godwine might well think that the game was up, that the star of Harold was fairly in the ascendant, and that neither interest nor duty called on him to plunge Wessex into a war with Northumberland and Mercia either to chap. vi. Godwine probably met \u00c6lf red. \u00c6lfred probably seized by Harold without Godwine's conniv ance. deliver \u00c6lfred or to revenge his wrongs. Such conduct would not be that of a sentimental and impulsive hero ; it would be that of a wary and hard-headed statesman. Such conduct would involve no real treachery; but it might easily give rise to the suspicion of treachery. If Godwine received the \u00c6theling, if Harold's agents afterwards seized him, it would be an easy inference that Godwine"], [549, "PROBABLE INNOCENCE OF GODWINE. 501 betrayed him to Harold. As soon as the tale had once chap. vi. got afloat, mythical details would, as ever, gather round it. When Godwine was once believed to have betraj'ed \u00c6lfred, it would be an obvious improvement on the story to make him a personal agent in the barbarities to which his sup posed treason had given occasion. It is clear that the ordinary narrative, as it stands, cannot be received ; but in some such explanation as this we may discern the probable kernel of truth on which the fabulous details gradually fastened themselves.1 On the whole then I incline to the belief that the great Probable Earl, every other recorded deed of whose life is the deed of 0HJod-Ce an English patriot, who on every other occasion appears as wlne conciliatory and law-abiding, who is always as strongly opposed to everything like wrong or violence as the rude age in which he lived would let him be, did not, on this one occasion, act in a manner so contrary to his whole character as to resort to fraud or needless violence to compass the destruction of a man of English birth and kingly descent. The innocence of Godwine seems to me to be most likely in itself, most consistent with the circum stances of the time, and not inconsistent with such parts of our evidence as seem most trustworthy. But in any case, even if, while casting aside palpable fables and con tradictions, we take the evidence, so far as it is credible, at the worst, even then it seems to me that the great Earl is at least entitled to a verdict of Not Proven, if not of Not Guilty. The next year after the unlucky attempt of \u00c6lfred2 was Disap marked by the breaking down of the short-lived arrangement 0f the hopes x It will be seen that my view is built mainly on the account in the Encomium Emm\u00e6. 2 The year of \u00c6lfred's death was the year of the marriage of his half sister Gunhild.

The West-Saxons had seemingly supported Harthacnut as the representative of that policy of his father which had raised Wessex, not only to the headship of England and of all Britain, but to the practical headship of all Northern Europe. No hope on the part of any people was ever more grievously disappointed. No contrast could be greater than the contrast between Wessex in the days of Cnut and Wessex in these two years of Harthacnut. Wessex was no longer the chosen dominion, Winchester was no longer the chosen capital, of an Emperor of the North, whose name was dreaded on the Baltic and reverenced on the Tiber. The old Imperial kingdom had sunk to be, what it had never been before, a dependent province ruled by repre sentatives of an absent sovereign. A King of the Danes, who did not think England worthy of his presence, held the West-Saxon kingdom, seemingly as a vassal of the King of the Mercians and Northumbrians, and entrusted it to the government of his Norman mother. It would doubtless be no excuse in English eyes that Denmark was now threatened by Magnus of Norway,1 and that Hartha cnutfs first duty was to provide for its defence. To the West-Saxon people it would simply seem that they had chosen a King whom no entreaties on the part of his English subjects could persuade to come and take personal possession of his English kingdom. Being absent, he must have remained uncrowned, and his lack of the con secrating rite would alone, in the ideas of those times, be enough to make his government altogether uncertain and provisional. Even the influence of Godwine could not prolong \u2014 most likely it was not exerted to prolong \u2014 a state of things so essentially offensive to all patriotic feeling. It was felt that to accept the rule of Harold would be a far less evil than to keep a nominal independence which was CHAP. VI. oftheWest Saxons.

Popular feeling there- ohap.vi. fore set strongly in favour of union with Mercia and North humberland, even under the doubtful son of \u00c6lfgifu of Northampton. \" Man chose Harold over all to King, and Hartha forsook Harthacnut, for that he was too long in Denmark.\"1 posed in That is, I conceive, the Witan of Wessex, in discharge of andHarold their undoubted constitutional rig-lit ,2 deposed their King- chosen Harthacnut, and elected the King of the Mercians and all Eng- Northumbrians as their immediate sovereign, the election IO-J being, as it would seem, confirmed by a vote of the Witan of all England.

England again became one kingdom under one King, an union which since that day has never been broken. The reign of the new King of the English was short and troubled. His first act was the banishment of the Lady Banish- Emma, who was sent out of the land at the beginning of Emma. winter.4 She did not return to Normandy, as that country io37- 1 So the Abingdon and Worcester Chronicles, those which do not dis tinctly mention the division ; \" Her man geceas Harold ofer eall to kyninge ; and forsoc HarSacnut, forfam he w\u00e6s to lange on Denmarcon.\" So Florence ; \" Haroldus Rex Merciorum et Nortbhymbrorum, ut per totam regnaret Angliam, a principibus et omni populo rex eligitur.

The expression is the same as that which is used in the years 963 and 964 for the expulsion of secular priests from several churches, and in 1045 for the banishment of Gunhild. One would like to know in what this driving out differed from regular outlawry. Possibly the driving out involved an actual personal removal, while the banishment involved in a sentence of outlawry was only constructive, like the Roman aqu\u00e6 et ignis interdictio. Godwine, on his outlawry, was allowed five clays to leave the country (Peterborough Chronicle, 105 1). The tone of the Worcester and Abingdon Chronicles certainly seems to imply that the"], [552, "504 THE DANISH KINGS IN ENGLAND. was now in all the confusion attendant on the minority of its new sovereign, the future Conqueror. She betook herself to the court of Baldwin of Flanders, which we shall henceforth find serving as the general place of refuge for English exiles. She was received with all honour by Baldwin and his Countess Adela.1 Two of the near kinswomen of Baldwin will play a prominent part in our future history; one of them indeed, his daughter Matilda, the wife of the great William, was destined, within thirty years, to fill the place from which Emma herself had been driven. CHAP. VI. Character of Harold Of the administration of Harold himself we hear hardly anything. The tale which affirms that he reigned with out the usual consecrating rite charges him also with entire neglect of Christian worship, and of choosing the hour of mass for his hunting or other amusements.2 Other accounts however imply that he was not wanting in the conventional piety of the age.3 He at least, like measure was a harsher one than that of ordinary outlawry; \"And man draf ut his [HarSacnutes] modor \u00c6lfgyfe pa cwene [a rare use of that word instead of hl\u0153fdige~\\, butan \u00e6lcere mildheortnesse, ongean fone walk-ndan winter.\" Florence translates, describing her as \" Alfgiva, quondam Anglorum regina.\" Does this imply any formal deposition from royal rank ? 1 Enc.

On Adela, see above, p. 469. 2 The Encomiast (iii. 1), after mentioning \u00c6thelnoth's refusal to crown Harold, continues ; \" Tandem desperatus abscessit, et 'episcopalem bene dictionem adeo sprevit, ut non solum ipsam odiret benedictionem, verum etiam universam fugeret Christianitatis religionem. Namque, dum alii ecclesiam Christiano more missam audire subintrarent, ipse aut saltus canibus ad venandum cinxit, aut quibuslibet aliis vilissimis rebus occu pavit, ut tantum declinare posset quod odivit.\" There is also what seems to be an allusion to the alleged irreligion of Harold in a foreign Chronicle, the Annals of Hildesheim, Pertz, iii. 100; \" Hiemali tempore Chnuht, rex Danorum et Anglorum, immatura morte pr\u00e6ventus obivit, et Christiana religio ab ipso fideliter exculta periclitari c\u0153pit.\" Yet Harold is not mentioned, and the entry goes on with only partial accuracy ; \" Filius ejus junior, Haerdechunt nomine, regnum ipsius post eum consensu provincialium obtinuit.\" 3 There is a very remarkable document of this reign, in which Harold"], [553, "REIGN OF HAROLD. 505 other Kings, kept chaplains in his personal service, so that chap. vi. he can hardly have been the avowed heathen or infidel which he appears in the hostile picture.

Certain revenues at Sandwich belonging to Christ Church at Canterbury had been seized by the King's officers, and partly alienated to the rival monastery of Saint Augustine's. It appears however that this was done without the order or knowledge of Harold, who was then sick at Oxford, and who, on learning the fact, expressed great indignation and ordered restitution. Mr. Kemble dates the document in 1038, but it is clear that it must, as Sir Henry Ellis says, belong to 1039, or perhaps to the beginning of 1040. 1 See Hook, Archbishops, i. 487; Stubbs, Reg. Sacr.

That these men shared in the Harold ,. o,.,tti-ii-i i i i and the promotions of which Harold had an unusual number to Godwine distribute, that Lyfing especially became the King's per- sonal friend,2 seems to show that a perfect reconciliation was now brought about between Harold and the party which had opposed his original election. We may infer that Emma was sacrificed to the King's personal dislike, a dislike which, it seems to be implied, was shared by the mass of the people.3 But there seems to have been no disposition on Harold's part to bear hard in any other way on his former antagonists. A certain amount either of generosity or of policy must have found a place in his character. It is probably a sign of degeneracy and weakness on the part of Harold's government that the vassal king doms no longer remained in the same state of submission to which they had been brought during at least the later days of Cnut.

The canons of Durham are met to choose a Bishop after the three years' widowhood of the see which followed the death of Ealdhun (see above, p. 448) ; Eadmund asks in joke why they do not choose him; they forthwith choose him in earnest, but agree to consult Saint Cuthberht ; a voice issuing from his tomb thrice names Eadmund as Bishop. Eadmund now objects, on the ground of his not being a monk like his predecessors \u2014 an odd reason to give to a chapter of seculars \u2014 but the election is approved by King Cnut, Eadmund makes his profession as a monk, and he is consecrated by Archbishop Wulfstan. This story seems to imply a degree of freedom of election in capitular bodies of which we find a few, but only a few traces at this time.

VI, Hartha cnut pre pares to assert his claims. The reign and life of Harold were now drawing to an end. Harthacnut was not at all disposed to acquiesce in the arrangements which had wholly shut him out from England. His Northern possessions were now safe. A treaty had been concluded with Magnus, according to which, as in some other instances of which we have heard, each King, in case of the other dying childless, was to succeed to his kingdom.3 Harthacnut therefore was now able to turn his thoughts in the direction of England, and a message from his mother in Flanders is said to have further worked upon his mind.4 He began to make great preparations for an invasion of England,5 but for the present he merely sailed to Flanders with ten ships,6 i\u00b039- 1 So I understand the words of Simeon, Hist. Dun. iii. 9 ; \" Magna parte equitum suorum ab his qui obsidebantur interfecta, confusus aufugit, fugiens pedites interfectos amisit.\" The mention of \" equites \" need not imply that the Scottish army contained cavalry strictly so called, that is, men who used their horses in actual battle. It is enough to justify the expression if, among the Scots, as among the English, the chief men rode to the field (see above, p. 271); the chief men, as usual, would suffer most severely in the actual combat, while those among them who survived would have the advantage in flight. There is another entry in the Durham Annals which places both this siege and the death of Harold in 1039. \"Hoc anno Du nechanus rex Scotorum cum exercitu magno Dunelmum obsidens, fugatus ab obsessis, magnam suorum multitudinem amisit.\" 2 Sim.

The universal belief of the moment was that the choice of Harthacnut was the right and wise course.1 An embassy, of which \u00c6lfweard, Bishop of London and Abbot of Evesham, was a leading member,2 was sent to Bruges, to invite the newly-chosen Sandwich ; \" Hardecnut . . . susceptus est [underfangen] et electus in regem simul ab Anglis et Dacis.\" This comes, with improvements, from the Peterborough Chronicle ; \" On pis ilcan geare com Hardacnut cyng to Sandwic. . . . and he was sona underfangen ge fram Anglum ge fram Denum.\" Taken alone this might imply that Harthacnut came over, like \u00c6lfred, to seek his fortune, only with a luckier result ; but the other Chronicles distinctly assert the previous embassy and therefore imply the previous election. 1 Chronn. Ab. and Wig. \" And man sende \u00e6fter HarSacnute to Brygce ; wende p\u00e6t man wel dyde.\" So Florence, \"bene se facere putantes.\" 2 See Hist. Rams. c. 94, 95, for the embassy and for an accompanying miracle. \u00c6lfweard was a somewhat remarkable person. He was first a monk of Ramsey and then Abbot of Evesham, which office he held in plurality with his bishopric. The church of Evesham had fluctuated more than once between monks and secular canons, the canons being last intro duced by \u00c6lf here of Mercia in the disputes which followed the death of Eadgar. See above, p. 263. Many of the estates fell into the hands of laymen, especially into those of Godwine of Lindesey, who died at Assandun. They were recovered from Godwine by a legal process, seemingly before the Witan of Mercia (\" coram multis principibus hujus patri\u00e6 \"), by the Abbot Brihtni\u00e6r. But Godwine seized them again during the absence of \u00c6thelred in Normandy in 1013. One almost fancies that this must have been by a grant from Swegen, to whom Lindesey was one of the first parts of England to submit. See above, p. 358. \u00c6thelred on his return in 1014 appointed \u00c6lfweard Abbot, who again expelled Godwine, seemingly by force (\" fretus auxilio Dei atque regis . . . cum magna fortitudine hine expulit \"). The local chronicler looks on Godwine's death at Assandun as the punishment of this sacrilege; \" Godwinus vero qui eas injuste habuit eodem anno (?)

His short reign is merely a repetition of the first and worst days of his father, while he could not, like his father, invoke even the tyrant's plea of necessity in palliation of his evil deeds.

His first act was to wring a heavy contribution from his new subjects for an object which in no way concerned them. We now learn incidentally that the standing navy of England, both under Cnut and under Harold, had consisted of six- teen ships, and eight marks were paid, seemingly yearly, either to each rower singly or to some group of rowers.1 Hnrtha- Harthacnut had come over with sixty ships, manned by Danegeld. Danish soldiers, and his first act was to demand eight marks for each man of their crews, a piece of extortion which at once destroyed his newly gained popularity.2 He then began to revenge himself on his enemies alive and dead. His first act in this way was an act of sense less brutality towards the dead body of his half-brother the Harold's late King. The dead Harold, the Chronicles tell us, was ten-ed. 1Sm dragged up and shot into a fen. Other writers tell the story with more detail.3 Some of the officers of his house hold, Stir his Mayor of the Palace,4 Eadric his dispenser, Thrond his executioner, all, we are told, men of great dignity, were sent to Westminster to dig up the body, and in their company we are surprised to find Earl Godwine and \u00c6lfric Archbishop of York. Westminster was neither in Godwine's earldom nor in \u00c6lfric's diocese, so that both 1 Chron.

We are however told that \u00c6lfric was some thing more than an instrument in the matter; it was specially at his advice that Harthacnut was guilty of this cowardly piece of spite, one which, like the brutalities of Harold himself towards the comrades of \u00c6lfred, did not go without imitators in more polished times. The body of and buried Harold was treated on the restoration of Harthacnut much \u00b0 as the body of Oliver Cromwell was treated on the restora tion of Charles the Second. The late King was dug up, beheaded, and thrown, according to this account, into the Thames. The body was afterwards brought up by a fisher man, and received a second burial. The large Danish population of London had a burial-place of their own with out the walls of the city, the memory of which is still retained in the name of the church of Saint Clement Danes. There Harold's body was again buried, secretly, we may suppose, though the act is spoken of as a tribute of honour paid by the Danes of London to the King whose accession to the throne had been so largely their own doing. No act could have been more offensive to the Danes settled in England than these insults offered to the body of their own chosen prince. Harthacnut's next act was to Hartha enrage all his subjects, English and Danish, by laying on seconri them another enormous Daneg-eld of about twenty-two a J 1040-1. thousand pounds, with another sum of more than eleven thousand pounds for thirty-two ships, probably a fresh contingent which had just come from Denmark.1 He was 1 Florence seems to put the two Danegelds together, but the Peter borough Chronicle (1039, I\u00b04\u00b0) clearly distinguishes them.

Some other persons unnamed joined with him in bringing the charge.2 Of the two defendants the Bishop was the easier victim. Lyfing lost his bishopric of Worcester, which was given to his accuser to hold in plurality,3 as it was held by several Archbishops of York before and after. Lyfing however recovered Worcester in the course of the next year, as the Trial and price, we are told, of money paid to the King.4 Whether Godwine.0 the deposition of Lyfing was effected with any legal forms we are not told ; but the Earl of the West-Saxons certainly underwent a regular trial before the Witan.

Godwine asserted his own innocence on oath, and his solemn plea of Not Guilty was confirmed by the oaths of most of the Earls and chief thegns 1 of England. We must not judge of the value of such an acquittal by the ideas of our own time. In a modern trial, some of Godwine's compurgators would have had to act as his judges ; some would have been examined as witnesses to the facts ; others might, at least in the case of a less illustrious defendant, have appeared as witnesses to character. In the rude state of the law in those times, these distinctions were not thought of. But it does not follow that substantial justice was not done. Godwine's acquittal was as solemn as any acquittal could be. All the chief men of England swore to their belief in his innocence. The only difference between such an acquittal and a modern acquittal on a trial before the House of Lords is that, in the ancient mode of procedure, the voices of those who of their own knowledge affirmed Godwine to be innocent, and the voices of those who accepted bis inno- cence on their witness, were all reckoned together.

There are those who hold, in defiance of all fact and all reason, that Sir Thomas More and Anne Boleyn must have been guilty, because English courts of justice pronounced them to be guilty. I am surely asking much less if I ask that Godwine may be held to be innocent, because an English court of justice, whose verdict is outweighed by no facts or 1 Flor.

VI. One circumstance which in our days would at once throw suspicion upon the verdict proves nothing at all according to the ideas of those days. Ages after the time of Hartha- cnut, in times which by comparison seem as yesterday, English judges did not scruple to receive presents from their suitors, and English sovereigns did not scruple to receive presents from their subjects. It is always possible that such presents may be bribes in a guilty sense ; it is always equally possible that they may not. It therefore proves nothing either way when we read that the Earl of the West- Saxons, solemnly acquitted by his peers, had still to buy his full restoration to the friendship) of his highest judge at the cost of a magnificent gift. We have already seen how dear a possession a ship was in Danish eyes ; 2 we have seen how acceptable a gift it might be in English eyes.3 We have seen too what an astonishing amount of adornment the warriors of the North lavished upon these cherished instruments, almost companions, of their war fare.4 Though we hear nothing of any warlike exploits of Harthacnut,5 he had enough of the wiking in him for a well-equipped ship to be the most acceptable of all gifts.6 Godwine therefore gave Harthacnut a ship with a beak of gold, manned with eighty chosen warriors armed with all the magnificence of the full panoply of Godwine purchases the favour of Hartha cnut by a magni ficent ship, 1 See Appendix VVV. 2 See above, pp. 354, 357. 3 See above, p. 340. 4 See above, p. 357. 5 Except in one Danish Chronicle (Chron.

Taxes of this kind always came in slowly,2 and this particular tax came in with special slowness. Military force was needed to extort payment ; the housecarls, who do not seem to have been sent on such errands in the clays of Cnut, were now turned into tax gatherers, and were sent into every shire in England to collect the King's tribute.3 That soldiers entrusted with such a duty behaved with insolence and violence we might take for granted in any age. In their conduct we may probably find the historical groundwork for those wonder ful tales of Danish oppression in which later and rhetorical writers indulge.4 No doubt this collection of the Dane geld was accompanied by much oppression ; but there is no evidence that it was oppression inflicted by Danes as Danes on Englishmen as Englishmen. As far as we can see, the state of things under Harthacnut must have been something like the state of England under John and Henry the Third. The natives, of whatever race, and the settlers who were fairly naturalized in the country, were all alike taxed for the sake of the mere strangers who had come in the King's train.5 We cannot suppose that CHAF.

The murder deserved legal punishment, but Harthacnut preferred a form of chastisement for which unluckily he could find precedents in the reigns of better princes than him self.3 He is said to have been further stirred up to vengeance by one who ought to have been the first to counsel mercy. Archbishop \u00c6lfric had, as we have seen, received the bishopric of Worcester on the deposition of Lyfing ; 4 it would seem that the citizens refused to receive him.5 They were doubtless attached to their own patriotic pastor, and they may well have been unwilling to be again made an appendage to the Northumbrian metropolis. In revenge for this injury, \u00c6lfric, we are told, counselled the terrible punishment which Harthacnut now decreed for his flock. The offending city and shire were to feel the full extremity of military vengeance ; the town was 1 See above, p. 316. 2 Flor.

For this purpose Harthacnut sent nearly all his housecarls \u2014 unhappily we are not told their numbers \u2014 under the command of all the chief men of England. The three great Earls, Godwine of Wessex, Leofric of Mercia, Siward of Northumberland,1 and their subordinate Earls, among whom Thored of the Middle- Angles or Eastern part of Mercia,2 and Banig of the Mages\u00e6tas or Herefordshire 3, are specially mentioned, were all sent against the one city of Worcester. Ten years later, when Eadward the Confessor required the like chastisement to be inflicted on the town of Dover, Godwine utterly refused to have any hand in such a business, and distinctly asserted the right of every English man to a legal trial. But in that case the alleged crime had been done in Godwine's own earldom, and no doubt Godwine's power was much less under Harthacnut than it became under Eadward, most likely much less than it had been under Cnut. As things now stood, it was hardly possible to disobey, unless the Earls had been prepared for the extreme measure of deposing the King.

It was not at the head of the forces of their several chap. vi. governments that the Earls were bidden to attack the offending city. Those forces would have taken some time to bring together, and. when they were brought together, they would doubtless have sympathized with their intended victims. The King had now at his command a body of Janissaries, who could march at a moment's notice, a force bound to him by a personal tie, and ready to carry out his personal will in all things. It was no doubt deemed a great stroke of policy to implicate in the deed all the chief men of the land, English and Danish, by putting them at the head of the King's personal force. But it seems plain that the Earls showed little zeal in the bloody errand on which they were sent.

And Worcester. ls a natural conjecture that the restoration of the popular prelate and the exclusion of the Northumbrian Metropolitan was one of the articles agreed on between the Earls and the citizens. Worcester has been happy in its Bishops in more than one great crisis of our history. Side by side with Godwine we find Lyfing ; side by side with Harold we find Wulfstan ; and in later times, when the part of Godwine is played again by Simon of Montfort, we find Walter of Cantelupe walking in the steps of Lyfing, and [1265.] saying mass and hearing the confession of the martyred Earl on the morning of the fight of Evesham.2 Harthacnut had still another great crime in store; but the burning of Worcester seems to have set the final seal to the shame and hatred which he had drawn upon himself Hartha- among all classes of his people.3 It may have been a cnut recalls Eadward desperate effort to win back some measure of popularity mandy.\u00b0r\" w\"ich now led him to send for his half-brother Eadward out I04r- of Normandy.4 He could have had no personal affection mischief.

But the events of the next year showed that popular feeling was now veering round towards the ancient royal family. The memory of Cnut had secured the throne to two of his sons in succession ; but this feeling could hardly have survived the evil deeds of Harold and Harthacnut. Harthacnut himself was childless; he was also, young as he was,1 in failing health.2 The recall of Eadward at once provided him with a successor in case of his death, and with one whose presence would be some support to him while he lived. Foreign writers tell us that he associated Eadward with him in the kingdom.3 For this statement there is no English authority, and it is not according to English customs. But to have given Eadward the government of a part of the kingdom, whether as Earl or as Under-king, would have been in no way wonderful. We do not however hear anything of such an arrangement; Eadward is set before us as living in great honour at his brother's court, but no English writer describes him as holding any administrative office.4 affirm that Harthacnut sent for him, but it is surely a natural inference. The invitation is distinctly asserted by the Encomiast, p. 39. William of Mahnesbury however (ii. 188) seems to imply that Eadward came unin vited ;' \" Germanum Edwardum, annos\u00e6 peregrinationis t\u00e6dio, et spe fra tern\u00e6 necessitudinis, natale solum revisentem, obviis, ut aiunt, manibus excipiens indulgentissime retinuit.\" 1 Cnut married Emma in 1017.

Emma had brought with her Hugh the French churl, who betrayed Exeter to the Dane.1 So her son, even when coming back as a private man, brought with him the advanced guard of that second swarm of strangers who were finally to bring the land into bondage. Among other Frenchmen, Eadward brought with him to England his nephew Ralph, the son of his sister Godgifu by her first husband Drogo of Mantes.2 He must now have been a mere youth ; but he lived to be gorged with English wealth and honours, to bring his feeble force to oppose the champions of England, and to be branded in our history as \" the timid Earl,\" 3 who sought to work improvements in English warfare, and himself turned and fled at the first sight of an armed enemy. CHAP. VI. The latest internal events of the reign of Harthacnut call our thoug-hts once more to the 2-reat Northumbrian earldom. They set vividly before us the unrestrained barbarism of that part of the kingdom. I have already described the strange career of Uhtred, and how he at last died, by the connivance of Cnut in his early days, but by the personal vengeance of an enemy whom he had himself unwisely omitted to slay.4 A fate almost literally the same now overtook one of his descendants and successors, whose story introduces us more directly to one of the great actors of the next reign. Uhtred, as we have seen, was suc ceeded by his brother Eadwulf Cutel, at first, it would seem, under the superiority of the Danish Eric.5 The The North humbrian Earls.

Whether this was puts Thur done by way of public justice or of private assassination J?ra\u00b0,d to does not appear, and the savage manners of the Northum brian Danes most likely drew no very wide distinction between the two. But at all events the deadly feud w ent on from generation to generation. A bitter enmity raged between Ealdred and Thurbrand's son Carl, evidently a powerful thegn.3 The two, we are told, were constantly seeking each other's lives.4 Common friends contrived to reconcile them, and, like Cnut and Eadmund, they were more than reconciled ; they became sworn brethren. In this character they undertook to go together on a pil grimage to Rome ; but this pious undertaking, like so many other undertakings of that age, was hindered by stress of weather.5 They returned to Northumberland together.

His gigantic stature, his vast strength and personal prowess, made him a favourite hero of romance. He boasted of the same marvellous pedigree as Ulf; perhaps indeed Siward and Ulf might claim a common forefather on the non-human side. His name is attached to several charters of the reign of Cnut, but he does not seem to have risen to Earl's rank in his time. He married \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d,3 a daughter of Earl Ealdred, a marriage which seems to have been his only connexion with the house of the Northumbrian Earls. Whether he laid any claim to the Bernician earldom in right of his wife it is hard to say; he was at any rate ready to abet the criminal designs of Harthacnut against its present possessor. Eadwulf seems to have been a ruler of more vigour than his uncle of the same name ; at least we hear, though rather darkly, of a devastating campaign carried on by him against the Britons, a name which here can mean only the inhabitants of Strathclyde.4 He was however in ill odour at the court of Harthacnut ; probably he and the men of his earldom had been among the fore most in pressing the claims of Harold. He now came to make his peace with the King, and was received by him to full friendship.5 But Harthacnut was as little bound CHAP. VI. Si ward of Deira. 1 See above, p. 520. 2 Will. Malms, iii. 253.

He held large estates in Somerset, Essex, and elsewhere. Accord ing to the legend, a miraculous crucifix was found on his lordship of Lutgaresbury in Somerset, on the top of the peaked hill from which the place in later times took its name of Montacute. For the reception of this revered relic he built a church on his estate of Waltham in Essex, and made a foundation for two priests. The place was then a mere wilderness, unmarked by any town, village, or church ; Tofig had only a hunting-seat in the forest. But along with the building of the church, he gathered a certain number of inhabitants on the spot, and thus, like Ealdhun at Durham, founded the town as well as the minster of Waltham.1 This was in the days of Cnut. Tofig must have been an elderly man at the time of his marriage with Gytha, \u2014 his eulogist indeed tells us that his youth was renewed like that of the eagle.2 His son \u00c6thelstan was of an age to take a share in public affairs, and his grandson Ansgar was able to hold great offices a few years later. Gytha then can hardly fail to have been his second wife, and he seems not to have long survived his marriage. But the bridal, held at the house of Gytha's father at Lambeth, was honoured with the presence of the King.

He died, and his body' was carried to Winchester and buried by that of his father Cnut in the Old Minster.1 With him the direct line of Cnut came to an end. The times were such that the land could not long abide without a King. Even before the burial of Harthacnut another great national solemnity had taken place. If Swegen cherished any hopes of the English succession, they vanished when, on his return to England, he found a son of \u00c6thelred already called to the throne of his fathers. \"Before the King buried were, all folk chose Eadward to King at London.\"2 CHAP. VI. Eadward chosen King. June, 1042. I have thus gone through the whole of that part of my history which I look upon as introductory to its main subject. We have now gone through all the events which form the remoter causes of the Norman Conquest. The accession of Eadward at once brings us among the events which immediately led to the Conquest, or rather we may look upon his accession as the first stage of the Conquest itself. Swegen and Cnut had shown that it was possible for a foreign power to overcome England by force of arms. The misgovernment of the sons of Cnut hindered the formation of a lasting Danish dynasty in England; the throne of Cerdic was again filled by a son of Woden ; but there can be no doubt that the shock given to the country by the Danish Conquest, especially the way in which the ancient nobility was cut off in the long struggle with Swegen and Cnut, directly opened the way for the coming of the Norman. Eadward did his best, wittingly or unwittingly, to make the path of the Norman still easier. This he did by accustoming Englishmen to the sight of strangers \u2014 not national kins- End of the pre liminary part of the history. The Norman Conquest begins with the election of Eadward. 1 Chronn. Petr. et Cant. The latter adds, \" His moder for his sawle gief into niwan mynstre S.

The great national reaction under Godwine and Harold made England once more England for a few years. But this change, happy as it was, could not altogether do away with the effects of the French tastes of Eadward. With Eadward then the Norman Conquest really begins, and his election there fore forms the proper break between these two great divisions of my subject. The men of the generation Position before the Conquest, the men whose eyes were not to leading behold the event itself, but who were to do all that they S\u2122 of. could do to hasten or to delay it, are now in the full the next maturity of life, in the full possession of power. Eadward is on the throne of England ; Godwine, Leofric, and Siward divide among them the administration of the realm. The next generation, the warriors of Stamford bridge and Senlac, of York and Ely, are fast growing into manhood. Harold Hardrada is already following his wild career of knight-errantry in distant lands, and is astonishing the world by his exploits in Russia and in Sicily, at Constantinople and at Jerusalem. Swegen Estrithson is still a wanderer, not startling men by wonders of prowess like Harold, but schooling himself and gather ing his forces for the day when he could establish a lasting dynasty in his native land. In our own land, the younger warriors of the Conquest, Eadwine and Mor kere and Waltheof and Hereward, were probably born, but they must still have been in their cradles or in their mothers' arms. But among the leaders of Church and State, Ealdred, who lived to place the crown on the head both of Harold and of William, was already a great prelate, Abbot of the great house of Tavistoek, soon to succeed the patriot Lyfing in the chair of Worcester.

Wulfstan, destined to outlive them all, had begun that career of quiet holiness, neither seeking for, nor shrinking from, responsibility in temporal matters, which distinguishes him among the political and military prelates of that age. In the house of Godwine that group of sons and daughters were springing up which for a moment promised to become the royal line of England. Eadgyth was growing into those charms of mind and person which perhaps failed to win for her the heart of the King who called her his wife. Gyrth and Leof wine were still boys ; Tostig was on the verge of man hood ; Swegen and Harold were already men, bold and vigorous, ready to march at their father's bidding, and before long to affect the destiny of their country for evil and for good. Beyond the sea, William, still a boy in years, but a man in conduct and counsel, was holding his own among the storms of a troubled mi nority, and learning those arts of the statesman and the warrior which fitted him to become the wisest ruler of Normandy, the last and greatest Conqueror of England. Thus the actors in the great drama are ready for their parts ; the ground is gradually clearing for the scene of their performance. The great struggle of nations and tongues and principles in which each of them had his share, the struggle in which William of Normandy and Harold of England stand forth as worthy rivals for the noblest of prizes, will form the subject of the next, the chief and central portion of my history. CHAP VI,"], [581, "APPENDIX. NOTE A. p. 13. The use of the word \"English.\" My readers will doubtless have remarked \u2014 indeed I have, in the text, expressly called their attention to the fact \u2014 that, in speaking of the Teutonic inhabitants of Britain looked at as a whole, I always use the word \"English,\" never the words \"Saxon\" or \"Anglo-Saxon,\" which are more commonly in use. I do this advisedly, on more grounds than one. I hold it to be a sound rule to speak of a nation, as far as may be, by the name by which it called itself in the age of which we are speaking. This alone would be reason enough for using the word \" English\" and no other. But besides this, the common way of talking about \" Saxons\" and \"Anglo-Saxons\" leads to various confusions and miscon ceptions ; it ought therefore to be avoided on that ground still more than on the other. I am not aware of any instance in which a Teutonic inhabitant of Britain, living before the Norman Conquest, and speaking in his own tongue and in his own name of the whole nation formed by the union of the various Teutonic tribes in Britain, uses the word \"Saxon.\" \"Engle,\" \"Angel-cyn,\" are the words always used. The only exceptions, if we can call them exceptions, are certain charters in which the King of the English is called \" King of the Anglo-Saxons.\" Of these I shall presently speak (see below, p."], [582, "534 APPENDIX. 540, and Appendix B). But I am not aware that the word \"Anglo-Saxon\" is ever used in English writings except in the royal style, and even there it is excessively rare. It is quite certain that the word \" Anglo-Saxon\" was not used, any more than the word \" Saxon,\" as the ordinary name of the nation. An inhabitant of one of the real Saxon settlements might indeed call himself a Saxon as opposed to his Anglian or Jutish neigh bours. But even in this case it is remarkable that we very seldom find the word \"Saxon\" used alone. It is almost always coupled with one of its geographical adjuncts, \" West,\" \" East,\" or \"South.\" Cuthred's army at Burford (see pp. 38, 51*7) is not spoken of as the \" Saxon\" but as the \" West-Saxon\" host, even though its adversaries were Angles. But the word \" Saxon\" is never used, in the native tongue, to express either the whole nation or any part of it which was not strictly Saxon. On the other hand, the words \"Engle\" and \"Angel-cyn\" are constantly used to express, not only the whole nation, but particular parts of it which were not strictly Anglian. The Chronicles use the words in this sense from the very beginning. They expressly tell us that Hengest and Horsa were, in strictness, not Angles, but Jutes; yet their followers are called \"Engle\" (473), and the Teutonic settlers as a whole are called \" Angel-cyn\" (449). One single passage in the Chronicles (605), which has another look, I shall have presently to speak of as being most distinctly an exception which proves the rule. \"Engle,\" in short, in native speech, is the name of the whole nation, of which the \" Seaxe\" are a part. On the other hand, for reasons which I have already stated (see p. 13), all the Teutonic settlers in Britain have always been known to their Celtic neighbours as \"Saxons.\" They were so in the fifth century ; they are so still. In the Pictish Chronicle, for instance, Lothian is always \" Saxonia.\" On the continent too the word was sometimes used to describe the Teutonic settlers in Britain before they were fully consolidated into one kingdom. At the very beginning Prosper (see Appendix C) talks of Saxons, while Prokopios (see above, pp. 22, 31) talks of \"AyyiXot. As Gregory the Great calls the Jutish \u00c6thelberht \"Rex Anglorum\" (B\u00e6da, Hist. Eccl. i. 32), so Einhard speaks of certain Northumbrians, who therefore were strictly Angles, as"], [583, "THE USE OF THE WORD \" ENGLISH.\" 535 Saxons. Ealhwine (Alcuin), who was certainly a Northumbrian, is called (Vita Karoli, 25) \" Saxonici generis homo,\" and one Ealdwulf, who seems also to have been a Northumbrian, appears (Annals, 808) as \"de ipsa Britannia, natione Saxo.\" But I suspect that this way of speaking was peculiar or nearly so to Einhard. A generation earlier, Paul Warnefrid has several pass ages which illustrate the uncertain way in which the Teutonic settlers in Britain were for a long time spoken of on the Continent. But though he uses the words \"Angli\" and \" Saxones'r as it might seem indiscriminately, there is no case in which it is clear that he applies the Saxon name to any but real Saxons, while he uses the Anglian name to take in those who were not real Angles. First of all, in ii. 6 the Saxons who joined in Alboin's invasion of Italy are distinguished as \" vetuli Saxones.\" In iii. 25 he records the conversion of the English, how \" Beatus Gregorius Augustinum, .... in Britanniam misit, eorumque pr\u00e6dicatione ad Christum Anglos convertit.\" In v. 30 we read of the \"ecclesi\u00e6 Anglorum;\" but in c. 32 the banished prince Bertavid \"ad Britan niam insulam Saxonumque regem properare disponit ;\" and in c. 33, \"navem ascendit ut ad Britanniam insulam ad regnum Saxonum transmearet.\" Here a West-Saxon King is doubtless meant. In vi. 28 we find two persons, seemingly Ine and his wife \u00c6thelburh, described in the text as \" duo reges Saxonum,\" and in the heading as \" duo Anglorum reges.\" Lastly, in vi. 37 the fashion of pilgrimage is attributed to \" multi Anglorum gentis nobiles et ignobiles ; \" and in the same chapter Saxones is used in its common meaning of Old-Saxons. Altogether, \"Anglus\" is the received and usual name even from the earliest times ; it became more usual as time went on, and after the nation was consolidated, when the \"Bex Anglorum\" was known on the con tinent as a great potentate, any other way of speaking altogether died out, and foreign nations always spoke of us as we spoke of ourselves. The opposition between \" Saxon \" and \" Norman,\" so commonly made by modern writers when speaking of the days of the Conquest, is never found in any contemporary writer of any nation. The rule on this head during the period of the Conquest is very plain. In the English Chronicles, in Domesday and other legal documents, and in the Bayeux Tapestry, the opposition is made between \"French\" and \" English.\" \" The King's"], [584, "536 APPENDIX. men, French and English,\" form an exhaustive division. In Latin writers, especially those on the Norman side, the opposition is made between \"Normans\" and \"English.\" \"Normans\" and \" Saxons\" are not opposed till long after. The earliest instance that I know of the usage is in Robert of Gloucester, who opposes \"Normans\" and \"Saxons\" exactly as Thierry does, in verses which Thierry has not inappropriately chosen for the epilogue of his work ; \" Of fe Normannes bep J>ys hey men, bat beb of bys lond, And be lowe men of Saxons, as ych understonde.\" (Vol. i. p. 363, ed. 1810.) It is possibly owing to the comparative laxity of the foreign use of the words that even the native use is not quite so strict in Latin writings as it is in those which are composed in the native tongue. Native writers, when following, or translating from, Welsh authorities, often follow the Welsh usage, and use the word \" Saxones\" in positions where, if they had been speaking in their own persons, they would certainly have used the word \"Angli.\" There is one instance, and, as far as I know, one instance only, of this Welsh usage having made its way into the English speech. In the entry in the Chronicles under the year 605, the word \" Saxon\" does occur for once in the wider sense. But the word is not used by the Chronicler in his own person, nor is it put into the mouth of any Angle or Saxon. It is found in a speech of Augustine to the Welsh Bishops; \"Gif Wealas nellaS sibbe wi<5 us, hy sculon \u00e6t Seaxena handa for wurcan,\" a prediction which was accomplished by the invasion of the Anglian \u00c6thelfrith. Here is a story, probably preserved by Welsh tradition, in which a Roman speaking to Welshmen is made to adopt a Welsh form of speech. The contrast between this passage and the ordinary language of the Chronicles makes the ordinary usage still more marked. In Latin the usage is more common. Asser, as a Welshman, naturally speaks of \" Saxones,\" and his so speaking is a strong proof of the genuineness of his work. Florence of Worcester therefore, in that part of his Chronicle in which he copies Asser, keeps Asser's language, and speaks of \"Saxones,\" whereas, when speaking in his own words or translating from the English Chronicles, he speaks of \"Angli\" from the beginning. No doubt the subjects of \u00c6lfred, the books,"], [585, "THE USE OF THE WORD \" ENGLISH.\" 537 poems, &c. to which the name \"Saxon\" is thus applied, were strictly Saxon; but no West-Saxon, speaking in his own tongue, would have called them so. \u00c6lfred calls his own tongue \" English,\" and nothing else ; but Asser naturally called it \" Saxon.\" So B\u00e6da, as long as he draws from Welsh sources or repeats Welsh traditions, uses the words \"Angli\" and \"Saxones\" almost in discriminately (Hist. Eccl. i. 14, 15, 22); but, as soon as he begins fairly to speak in his own person, he always uses \"Angli\" (i. 23 et seqq.). Exactly the same distinction will be found in the use of the words by \u00c6thelweard and Henry of Huntingdon, who constantly use the word \" Saxones\" in what we may call the Welsh stage of their histories. But Henry uses \"Anglus\" also from the beginning, and, when he gets fairly clear of Welsh matters, he uses it exclusively. It is most curious to see him, as in the Prologue to the fifth Book, fall back on the Welsh way of speaking when he has to make a summary of what has gone before. And as the Welsh way of speaking affected these writers, we find writers who had occasion to speak of Pictish matters affected in the like way by Pictish usage. Thus \u00c6ddi or Eddius, the biographer of Wilfrith (c. 19, 20), speaking of the relations between Picts and Northumbrians, uses the Pictish mode of speech ; he speaks of \" Saxones,\" and says that the Picts \" subjectionem Saxonum despiciebant.\" Besides these instances of Celtic influence on English speech, it is not uncommon to find in the charters the. word \"Saxonice\" used as a definition of language, where the vernacular definition would undoubtedly have been \" on Englisc.\" In West-Saxon charters the usage is in truth no more than we might have looked for. The words and things spoken of were Saxon in the strict sense. B\u00e6da too not uncommonly (iii. 7 et al.) uses \"Saxon\" as a description of language; but it is usually, if not always, when he is speaking of persons or places which are strictly Saxon. He may therefore mean \"Saxon\" as opposed to \"Anglian.\" But the usage certainly now and then passes these bounds, and we find the word Saxon and its derivatives applied to objects which were not strictly Saxon. Thus in a charter of Ecgfrith of Mercia in 796 (Cod. Dipl. i. 207), we find the words \" celebri vico qui Saxonice vocatur \u00e6t BaSum.\" Though even here it is worth remarking that the place spoken of, though at that time under"], [586, "538 APPENDIX. Mercian rule, was in a district which was originally Saxon and which became Saxon again. So in a deed of Archbishop Oswald as late as 990 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 253) we read how a certain grant \"in ista cartula Saxonicis sermonibus apparet.\" But the land spoken of is in Worcestershire, also a district originally Saxon. It is more remarkable when in a charter of Archbishop Wulfred in 825 (Cod. Dipl. i. 280), the Synod of Clovesho is said to be \" de diversis Saxonice partibus congregatum.\" As the docu ment chiefly relates to Mercian affairs, it is clear that \"Saxonia\" here means England generally. The word is used in the same sense at an earlier time in a petition of Wilfrith to Pope Agatho (Eddius, c. 29), in which he describes himself as \" episcopus Saxonice.\" So again in the letter \u2014 whether genuine or not, matters little \u2014 of Eleutherius of Winchester in William of Malmesbury (i. 30), he is described as \" pontificatus Saxonice gubernacula regens.\" In this passage \"Saxonia\" might mean Wessex; but Hw\u00e6tberht, Abbot of Wearmouth (B\u00e6da, Hist. Abb. Wiremuth, c. 14. p. 329 Hussey), also calls himself \"Abbas c\u0153nobii beatissimi apostolorum principis in Saxonia.\" It should of course be re membered that these are letters addressed to foreigners, and in which a foreign mode of speech is naturally adopted. Still, when I have these examples before me, and when I remember how late it was before the names \" Anglia\" and \"Englaland \" became thoroughly established in use, I am inclined to think that \" Saxonia\" may be the older name of the two. We have seen (see p. 79) that the name Englaland dates only from the last period of the Danish wars ; the earliest use of it that I have come across is not earlier than the reign of \u00c6thelred, being found in the treaty with Olaf and Justin in 991 (see p. 79, and below, Note DD). Here the word Englaland, \u00c6nglalancl, is twice found. From the latter days of \u00c6thelred and the reign of Cnut the territorial name becomes more and more commonly used. (It is needless to say that the entry in the Canterbury Chronicle for 876 and the long insertion at 995 are not contemporary.) It would seem then that the name of England was first used in opposition, not to Wales or Scotland, but to the Scandinavian lands. As opposed to the lands of the Scot and the Briton the strict territorial name was rather Saxony than England. It was only natural that it should be so. The part of Britain occupied by the Teutonic invaders, the English"], [587, "THE USE OF THE WORD \" ENGLISH.\" 539 land as distinguished from the English people, would receive its first territorial name from the Celts of the island, and that name would naturally be, as we have seen in the case of Lothian, \" Saxonia.\" In dealing with foreigners, even Englishmen might, in the days of Wilfrith or Hw\u00e6tberht, use the only territorial name which their country had as yet acquired, and, in the days of Wulfred, the same word might be now and then used as a rhetorical flourish. I am therefore inclined to think that there is really more authority for calling England, as a whole, \" Saxony,\" than there is for calling Englishmen, as a whole, \" Saxons.\" The Latin name Anglia is most likely older than the English Englaland. But it is hard to say when it came into contemporary use. It seems to be unknown to B\u00e6da, but it is familiar to \u00c6thelweard. A rarer form, \" Angul-Saxonia,\" \" Anglo-Saxonia,\" is now and then found, as in a charter of Eadward the Elder in Cod. Dipl. v. 165, and in a doubtful charter of \u00c6thelred (see below, p. 557). So in a Frankish ecclesiastical writer in Duchesne, Rer. Franc. Scriptt. i. 665, Queen Balthild is said to come \" de ultramarinis partibus Angli- Saxoni\u00e6.\" Still, whatever may have been the case in earlier times, all these usages had died out long before the time of the Norman Conquest. After all England and all Britain had been brought into subjection to a Saxon dynasty, we hear no more about \"Saxons\" or \"Saxony.\" The latest instance that I can remember of \"Saxonice\" being used for \"on Englisc\" is in a passage of Florence of Worcester (1002, see p. 306), where he says that the Norman Emma was \"Saxonice \u00c6lfgiva vocata.\" The ex- pression stands almost by itself; but it should be remembered that it is of the West-Saxon speech that it is used. During the period of the Conquest, as the people are always \"Angli\" and their land \" Anglia,\" so it is always the English language (\" lingua Anglica or Anglicana\"), never the Saxon, which contemporary writers oppose to the French. The fact that the word \" Saxon \" is thus occasionally used in Latin, in cases where we always find \" English \" used in the native tongue, is, I think, mainly to be attributed to the tendency, one which has more or less influence on almost all Latin writings then and since, to use expressions which sounded in any way grander or more archaic than those which were in common use. I suspect that the occasional use of \" Saxon \" instead of \" English \" was very"], [588, "APPENDIX. 540 much of a piece with the use, not uncommon in the charters, of \" Albion \" to express Britain. To talk of \" Saxonia,\" \" Saxonice,\" &c. was doubtless one of the elegancies of the Kanzleistyl of those days. It is an archaism, just as when, in a charter of Eadwig (Cod. Dipl. ii. 324; cf. 391), we read of the \" Gewissi,\" a name which had passed out of use ages before. Once or twice we find \"Teutonice\" instead of either \" Anglice \" or \"Saxonice.\" The decrees of the Synod of Cealcyth in 787 (Labbe and Cossart, vi. 1873) were published \"tarn Latine quam Teutonice, quo omnes intelligere possent.\" So in the Encomium Emm\u00e6 (ii. 18) we once find the word used where either English or Danish is intended, and the expression is an unusual and affected one as applied to either. In a most remarkable story told by Giraldus (Itin. Kamb. i. 6. p. 64 Dimock), a Welshman is said to speak to Henry the Second \" quasi Teutonice,\" and is presently answered \" Anglice.\" But Giraldus elsewhere (i. 8. p. 77), in his curious philological discussion, distinguishes \" Anglice \" and \" Teutonice,\" though his \" Teutonice \" does not seem to be High-~D\\iich. There can be no doubt that this use of \" Teutonice \" was simply an instance of \" the grand style.\" It is less clearly so when Fordun (ii. 9) says that in Scotland \" duabus utuntur linguis, Scotica videlicet et Theu thonica.\" For he writes at a time when men were just beginning to be unwilling to give the English name to the Teutonic speech of Scotland. But in earlier times we may be sure that, when men said either \"Teutonice\" or \"Saxonice\" instead of \"Anglice,\" the unusual word was chosen mainly as being finer. Still, in the great mass of instances, the use of the word \" Saxon,\" affected and archaistic as it is, is still accurate. It is rarely used out of the strictly Saxon dis tricts, while \" Anglus \" and its derivatives are freely used out of the strictly Anglian districts. The title of \" Rex Saxonum,\" so common in the age of \u00c6lfred, was, as I have elsewhere said (see p. 54), the most accurate which he could assume. Still it appears only as a Latin title ; in his vernacular will and his vernacular laws he is only \"King of the West-Saxons.\" (See p. 52, and Cod. Dipl. ii. 114.) It might be thought to have an English equivalent in the Abingdon Chronicle under 867, where we read, \" Her feng \u00c6pered \u00c6pelbryhtes bropor to Seaxna rice,\" but as all the other copies have \" West- Seaxna rice\" it is most likely a slip of the pen. The name \" Anglo-Saxon,\" though rare, is a genuine and ancient"], [589, "THE USE OF THE WORD \"ENGLISH.\" 541 description of the nation. There are some, though rare, vernacular examples of its use (see below, pp. 549, 556), to which I shall have to refer again. It is also used rather more commonly in Latin, as by Asser (M. H. B. 483 A), by Florence of Worcester (A. 1066), by Simeon of Durham (X Scriptt. 137). In the Latin charters, especially those of Eadwig, it is not uncommon (see the list in pp. 554-558). So in a charter of Eadward the Elder which has been quoted already (Cod. Dipl. v. 168, 169), as he calls the land \" Angul-Saxonia,\" so he twice calls himself \" Angul-Saxonum rex.\" The word is not uncommon in foreign writers; it occurs for instance in the singular passage of Lambert of Herzfeld (1066) in which Harold is called \" Rex Angli-Saxonum.\" To go back to earlier writers, it is found in Paul Warnefrid (iv. 23), where, describing the manners of the Lombards, he says, \" Vestimenta eis erant laxa et maxime lintea, qualia Angli-Saxones habere' solent.\" In c. 37, \" Cunibertus rex Hermilindam e Saxonum Anglorum genere duxit uxorem.\" Here the name Eormenhild, cognate with the royal Kentish names Eor- menred, Eormenburb, Eormengyth, and Eormengild, seems to show almost for certain from what part of England the Lombard King brought his wife. But presently in vi. 15 the West-Saxon Cead- walla appears as \" Cedoaldus rex Anglorum- Saxonum,\" though in the heading he is \" Theodebaldus rex Anglorum.\" (These passages show how fast the Anglian name was spreading over the Saxon and Jutish districts.) The compound name is used also by Widu- kind in a very amusing passage (i. 8 ; cf. p. 567), where, having mentioned how certain Saxons settled in Britain, he adds, \" Et quia ilia insula in angulo quodam maris sita est, Anglisaxones usque hodie vocitantur.\" So Prudentius of Troyes (Pertz, i. 449) calls \u00c6thelwulf \"Edilvulfus rex Anglorum-Saxonum.\" Elsewhere (i. 451) he gives him his usual title of \" Rex Occidenta- lium Saxonum.\" In another passage (i. 452) he records how in 860 a Danish fleet sailed \" ad Anglo-Saxones.\" And in a third, under the year 844 (Pertz, i. 441), \"Nortmanni Britanniam insulam ea quam maxime parte quam Angli-Saxones incolunt impetentes.\" So in the Annals of Quedlinburg (Pertz, iii. 32), \" Angli-Saxones in Britannia fidem percipiunt ; \" in those of Weissemburg, 1066 (Pertz, iii. 71), \"Comes Willihelmus qui et Basthart (see vol. ii. p. 582) Anglos-Saxones et regem illorum occidit regnumque obtinuit.\" In the Annales Altahenses, 1066"], [590, "APPENDIX. 542 (Pertz, xx. 817), we hear of \" Angli-Saxonici.\" In the Life of Saint Boniface (Pertz, ii. 338) London or \" Lundenwich \" is so called \" Anglorum Saxonumque vocabulo ; \" and in Aimon of Fleury (Pertz, ix. 375) Lewis the son of Charles the Simple flies \" ad Anglo-Saxones.\" All these passages remind us of the \"Prisci Latini,\" and all are in the plural. Orderic too once or twice uses expressions to the same effect. Thus he (666 A) makes certain Normans say \" Saxones Anglos prostravimus.\" Elsewhere he makes Wimund (525 B) speak of the original English conquerors as \"Angli-Saxones.\" Again, speaking in his own person (722 B), he recounts the Norman exploits, and adds, \" Hoc Itali et Guinili Saxonesque Angli usque ad internecionem experti sunt.\" And again in 887 B, where he is talking of Welsh matters and the pro phecies of Merlin, he speaks of \" Saxones Anglos, qui tune pagani Christicolas Britones oppugnabant.\" But these unusual phrases are clearly mere flourishes, just as when he calls the Byzantine Empire \" Ionia \" and its inhabitants \" Danai \" and \" Pelasgi.\" The passage reminds one of the comment of William of Poitiers (137), where, after describing the valour of the English at Senlac, he adds, \" Gens equidem ilia natura semper in ferrurn prompta suit, descendens ab antiqua Saxonum origine ferocissimorum hominum.\" But he never calls the English of his own time \" Saxons.\" \" Anglo-Saxon \" then, unlike \" Saxon,\" is a description which is fully justified by ancient authority. But it is quite clear that it is a description which never passed into common use. It is found mainly in charters and as a peculiarity of one or two writers, who doubtless thought that it had a grander or more learned sound than the usual name. The name by which our forefathers really knew themselves was \" English \" and none other. \" Angli,\" \" Engle,\" \" Angel-cyn,\" \" Englisc,\" are the true names by which the Teutons of Britain knew themselves and their language. The people are the English, their tongue is the English tongue, their King is the King of the English. The instances of any other use are to be found in a foreign language, and are easily accounted for by exceptional causes. And even these exceptional usages had quite died away before the stage of our history with which we are immediately concerned. The people whom William overcame at Senlac, and over whom he was crowned King at Westminster, knew themselves and were"], [591, "THE USE OF THE WORD \"ENGLISH.\" 543 known to their conquerors by the name of English and by the name of English alone. But it is sometimes argued that, though our forefathers con fessedly called themselves English, yet we ought, in speaking of them, to call them something else ; that, though \u00c6lfred called his own tongue English, we ought to correct him and call it Saxon. Now the presumption is surely in favour of calling any people by the name by which they called themselves, especially when that name had gone on in uninterrupted use to our own days. Our national nomenclature has never changed for a thousand years. In the days of \u00c6lfred, as now, the Englishman speaking in his own tongue called himself an Englishman. In the days of \u00c6lfred, as now, his Celtic neighbour called him a Saxon. As we do not now speak of ourselves by the name by which Welshmen and High landers speak of us, some very strong reason indeed ought to be brought to show that we ought to speak of our forefathers, not as they spoke of themselves, but as Welshmen and Highlanders spoke of them. But the reason commonly given springs out of mere misconception and leads to further misconceptions. From some inscrutable cause, people fancy that the word English cannot be rightly applied to the nation, its language, or its institutions, till after the Norman element has been absorbed into it ; that is, they fancy that nothing can be called English till it has become somewhat less English than it was at an earlier time. The tongue which \u00c6lfred, in the days of its purity, called English, we must not venture to call English till the days when it had received a considerable infusion of French. This notion springs from an utterly wrong conception of the history of our nation. The refusal to call ourselves and our forefathers a thousand years back by the same name springs from a failure to take in the fact that our nation which exists now is the same nation as that which migrated from Germany to Britain in the fifth century. In the words of Sir Francis Palgrave, \" I must needs here pause, and substitute hence forward the true and antient word English for the unhistorical and conventional term Anglo-Saxon, an expression conveying a most false idea in our civil history. It disguises the continuity of affairs, and substitutes the appearance of a new formation in the place of a progressive evolution.\" (Normandy and England, iii. 596.) People"], [592, "APPENDIX. 544 talk of the \" English \" as a new nation which arose, in the thirteenth century perhaps, as a mixed race of which the \" Saxons\" or \" Anglo-Saxons \" were only one element among several. Now in a certain sense, we undoubtedly are a mixed race, but not in the sense in which popular language implies. We are a mixed race in the sense of being a people whose predominant blood and speech has incorporated and assimilated with itself more than one foreign infusion. But we are not what our High-Dutch kinsmen call a Mischvolk, a mere colluvies gentium, a mere jumble of races in which no one element is predominant. People run over the suc cession of the various occupants of Britain \u2014 Romans, Britons, Saxons, Danes, Normans \u2014 sometimes as if they were races each of which ate up the one before it, sometimes as if they were, each in the same sense, component elements of the modern English nation. The correct statement of the case is much clearer and simpler. A Low-Dutch people, which took as its national name the name of one of its tribes, namely the Angles, settled in Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries. It has occupied the greater part of Britain ever since. It has ever since kept its unbroken national being, its national language, its national name. But it has at different times assimilated several foreign elements. The con quered Welsh were, as far as might be, slaughtered or driven out ; but a small Welsh infusion into our language, and therefore no doubt a small Welsh infusion into our blood, is owing to the fact that the women were largely spared. A small Welsh element was thus assimilated. The Danish element, far greater in extent than the Welsh, hardly needed assimilation ; the ethnical difference between the Englishman and the Dane was hardly greater than the ethnical difference between one tribe of Englishmen and another. Lastly came the Norman, or rather French, element, which was also gradually assimilated, but not till it had poured a most im portant infusion, though still only an infusion, into our institutions and our language. Thus, besides the kindred Danes, we have assimilated two wholly foreign elements, British and French, what our forefathers called Bret -Welsh and Gal -Welsh. But these elements are not coequal with the original substance of the nation. In all these cases, the foreign element was simply incorporated and assimilated into the existing Low-Dutch stock. The small Welsh element, the large Danish and French elements, were absorbed in"], [593, "THE USE OF THE WORD \"ENGLISH.\" 545 the predominant English mass. The Briton and the Norman gradually became Englishmen. The kindred Dane of course became an Englishman with far greater ease. All adopted the English name ; all adopted, while to some extent they modified, the English tongue. If we confine the name \" English \" to the men, the speech, the laws, of the time after the last assimilation had become complete, if we talk of \" Saxons \" as only one coequal element among others, we completely misrepresent the true history of our nation and our language. Such a way of speaking cuts us off from our connexion with our forefathers ; it wipes out the fact that we are the same people who came into this island fourteen hundred years back, and not another people. We have absorbed some very important elements from various quarters, but our true substance is still the same. We are like a Roman gens, some of whose members, by virtue of the law of adoption, were not Fabii or Cornelii by actual blood, but which none the less was the Fabian or Cornelian gens. If we allow ourselves to use, as people constantly do, the words \" Saxon \" or \" Anglo-Saxon \" as chrono logical terms, we altogether wipe out the fact of the unbroken life of our nation. People talk of \" Saxons \" and \" Anglo-Saxons \" as of races past and gone. Sometimes, especially in architectural disquisitions, they seem to fancy that all \" the Saxons \" lived at one time, forgetting that Harold is removed from Hengest by as many years as Charles the First is removed from Harold. A man, a word, a book, a building, earlier than 1066 is called \" Saxon ;\" whether the same man, word, book, or building, after 1066 is \" Norman,\" I have never been able to find out. Waltheof, born before 1066, was of course a \"Saxon;\" what were the children whom he begot and the buildings which he built after 1066 ? This chronological use of the word \" Saxon \" implies one of two alternatives ; either the \" Saxons \" were exterminated by the Normans, or else the \" Saxons \" turned into Normans. People talk of \"the Saxon Period\" and \"the Norman Period,\" as if they followed one another like the periods of geology, or like Hesiod's races of men. The \" Norman Period \" is a phrase which may be admitted to express a time when Norman in fluences were politically predominant. We may speak of a Norman period, as we may speak of an Angevin period or an Hanoverian period. But, if we are to talk of a \" Saxon period \" VOL. 1. N n"], [594, "APPENDIX. 546 at all, it is a period which began in 449 and which has not ended in 1877. The most grotesque instance of this confused sort of nomenclature is to be found in the technical language of unscientific philologers. The gradual result of the Norman Conquest on the English language was twofold. The English language, like other languages, especially other Low-Dutch languages, was, at the time of the Conquest, already beginning to lose, in popular speech at least, the fulness and purity of its ancient inflexions. This process the Norman Conquest hastened and rendered more complete. It also brought in a great number of foreign words into the language, many of which supplanted native words. The result of these two pro cesses is that the English of a thousand years back, like the Scandinavian or the High-Dutch of a thousand years back, is now unintelligible except to those who specially study it. But the English language has never either changed its name or lost its continuity. In the eyes of the scientific philologer, it is the same English tongue throughout all its modifications. But by unscien tific philologers, the language, from some utterly mysterious cause, is not called English until the two processes of which I speak are accomplished. Before those processes begin, it is \" Saxon \" or \"Anglo-Saxon;\" while they are going on, it is \"Semi-Saxon\" \u2014 a name perhaps the most absurd to be found in the nomenclature of any human study. It is manifest that, with such a nomencla ture as this, the true history of the English language and its relation to other Teutonic languages never can be understood. One word as to the name \" Anglo-Saxon.\" I have shown that it is a real ancient name, used, though very rarely, in English documents, and somewhat more commonly in Latin ones. But it was always a mere -formal description; it never became the familiar name of the nation. The meaning of the word also is commonly completely misconceived. In modern use \"Anglo-\" is a prefix which is used very freely, and which is certainly used in more than one meaning. We have heard of \" Anglo-Saxons,\" \" Anglo- Normans,\" \" Anglo-Americans,\" \" Anglo-Indians,\" \" Anglo-Catho lics.\" I cannot presume to guess at the meaning of the prefix in the last formation; but I conceive \"Anglo-Normans\" to mean Normans settled in England, and \"Anglo-Americans\" to mean Englishmen settled in America. By \" Anglo-Saxons,\" I conceive."], [595, "THE USE OF THE WORD \" ENGLISH.\" 547 in the vulgar use of the word, is meant Saxons who settled in England (meaning of course in Britain), as opposed to the Old- Saxons who stayed in Germany. It is as when Henry of Hunting- don (M. H. B. 708 C) inaccurately talks of an \"adventus Saxonum in Angliam,\" while the accurate B\u00e6da (Hist. Eccl. i. 23) talks of the \" adventus Anglorum in Brittaniam.\" And it would seem that this really was the sense in which the compound name was used by some of the foreign writers. Indeed, as soon as the Teutonic part of Britain came to be commonly known by the name of \" Anglia,\" some such phrase as \" Anglo-Saxones \" would be, from a continental point of view, not an unnatural description of the Saxons of the island as distinguished from those of the mainland. It is plain that all remembrance of continental \"Angli\" must have passed away from the mind of Widukind when he made the grotesque derivation \u2014 one not all peculiar to himself \u2014 which was quoted in p. 541. But this is not the meaning of the word \" Anglo-Saxon \" as used by Asser, Florence, and King \u00c6thelstan. \" King of the Anglo-Saxons,\" as a title of \u00c6thelstan or Eadred, meant simply \" King of the Angles and Saxons,\" a way of describing him which was clearly more correct, though far less usual, than the common style of \" Rex Anglorum.\" In the ancient Coronation Service (see vol. iii. chap. xi. and Appendix E ; Selden's Titles of Honour, 116), in the same prayer we twice read \"Anglorum vel ( = et) Saxonum,\" once \" Anglo-Saxonum.\" The latter form is clearly a mere abbreviation, perhaps a mere clerical error. That, under a purely Saxon dynasty, the title of \"Rex Anglorum \" became regular and universal, that \" Rex Saxonum \" died completely out, that \" Rex Anglo-Saxonum \" was always rare, is the most overwhelming proof that \" English \" was the real and only recognized name of the united nation. \" Anglo- Saxon\" then, in certain positions, is a perfectly correct descrip- tion. But it is dangerous to use it, because it is so extremely liable to misconstruction. Again, its correct use is so very narrow, that the term becomes almost useless. It has no real meaning except in the plural. It is quite correct to call \u00c6thelstan \" King of the Anglo-Saxons,\" but to call this or that subject of \u00c6thelstan \" an Anglo-Saxon \" is simply nonsense. I have as yet only once lighted on the use of the word in the singular, namely in the Vita Alchuini, 1 1 (Jaffe, Monumenta Alcuiniana, p. 25), where a N n a"], [596, "APPENDIX. 548 certain priest is described as \" Engelsaxo.\" See Mullinger, Schools of Charles the Great, 113. As a chronological term \"Anglo-Saxon \" is equally objectionable with \" Saxon.\" The \"Anglo-Saxon period,\" so far as there ever was one, is going on still. I speak therefore of our forefathers, not as \" Saxons \" or even as \"Anglo-Saxons,\" but as they spoke of themselves, as Englishmen \u2014 \"Angli,\" \"Engle,\" \"Angel-cyn.\" I call their language, not \"Saxon\" or even \"Anglo-Saxon,\" but, as \u00c6lfred called it, \" English.\" I thus keep to the custom of the time of which I speak, and I also avoid the misconception and confusion which must follow any other way of speaking. But the different shapes which names have taken in later times allow us to make an useful distinction between the two uses of the same word. In Latin it was necessary to use the single word \"Anglus\" to express both the whole nation and one particular part of it. But we can now speak of the whole nation as \" English,\" while we can speak of the tribe from which the nation borrowed its name as \" Anglian.\" When I wish pointedly to distinguish the men, the language, or the institutions of the time before 1066 from those of any time after 1066, I speak distinctively of \" Old-English,\" as our kinsmen sjDeak of \" Alt-Deutsch.\" I now leave the subject with a reference to the golden words of Sir Francis Palgrave, England and Normandy, iii. 630-2. NOTE B. pp. 28, 133. The Bretwaldadom and the Imperial Titles. It is almost impossible, after the connexion between them which Sir Francis Palgrave so earnestly strove to establish, to treat the question of the Bretwaldas apart from the question of the Imperial titles borne by the English Kings of the tenth and eleventh cen turies. The unbroken connexion between the two is the very life and soul of his theory. And in discussing the matter we must never forget that it is to Sir Francis Palgrave, more than to any other scholar, that we owe the assertion of the great truth, without which all medi\u00e6val history is an insoluble puzzle, that the Roman Empire did not come to an end in the year 476, but that the Empire and Imperial ideas, continued to be the very life of Euro pean politics for ages after. On this head I must refer my readers"], [597, "THE BRETWALDADOM AND THE IMPERIAL TITLES. 549 to Mr. Bryce's brilliant Essay on the Holy Roman Empire, where the whole doctrine is drawn out with wonderful clearness and power. (See also Historical Essays, First Series, p. 126.) But Sir Francis Palgrave, as usual, made too much of his theory ; his very learning and ingenuity carried him away. The Imperial doctrine itself, as put forth by him, was greatly exaggerated, and connecting, as he did, the Bretwaldadom with the later Imperial style, he was disposed to make as much as possible of the Bretwalda dom. Mr. Kemble, ou the other hand, is equally disposed to make as little as possible of the Bretwaldadom, and I must say that he slurs over the question of the Imperial titles in a strange way. In both parts of the controversy, Sir Francis Palgrave may have given a wrong explanation ; but he has at least given a very elaborate and ingenious explanation. Mr. Kemble leaves passages which must have some meaning without any explanation at all. For my own part, I cannot help adding that, years ago, when I first began these studies, I was altogether carried away by the fascination of Sir Francis Palgrave's theories. I soon saw their exaggerated cha racter, and how utterly unfounded a great part of them were. I was thus led to go too far the other way, and altogether to cast aside the notion of any Imperial sovereignty in our Kings. Later thought and study have at last brought me to an intermediate posi tion, for which I trust that stronger grounds will be found than for either of the extremes. The name Bretwalda comes from the well-known passage in the Chronicles under the year 827, where it is found only in the Winchester version, all the others having different spellings, Bry tenwalda, Bretanenwealda, Brytemvealda, Brytenweald. The only other place that I know where any of these forms or anything like them occurs is in a charter of \u00c6thelstan in 934, in which that King is described (Cod. Dipl. v. 218) as \" Ongol-Saxna cyning and Brytcenwalda eallozs ftyses iglandces;\" the Latin equivalent (p. 217) is \" Angul-Saxonum necnon et totius Britanni\u00e6 rex, gratia Dei regni solio sublimatus.\" Mr. Kemble (ii. 13, 20) argues that the reading Bretwalda is a false one, and that the meaning wielder, ruler, or Emperor of Britain, or of Britons, is altogether wrong. He takes the true reading to be Brytemvealda, which he derives from the adjective bryten, so as to mean wide ruler, quoting the word Bryten cyning and other similar cognates as compound forms. As a piece"], [598, "APPENDIX. 550 of Teutonic scholarship Mr. Kemble is most likely right, hut I doubt whether his correction of the etymology is of much strictly his torical importance. When the entry in the Chronicles was made, the title must have been familiar, and it must have conveyed some meaning. And the forms Bretwalda and Bretanenwealda seem clearly to show that those who used those forms meant them, rightly or wrongly, to mean wielder of Britain. In the charter of \u00c6thelstan again, though the Latin and the English do not exactly translate one another, I think it is plain that Britannia, Rex was meant to be the equivalent to Bryt\u00e6nwalda. I have therefore no scruple in keeping to the more usual form and in attaching to it the com monly received meaning. Less correct as a matter of scholarship, I conceive it to be more correct as a matter of history. But the passage in the Chronicles, as is well known, is founded on an equally well-known passage in B\u00e6da (ii. 5). B\u00e6da there reckons up seven Kings, \u00c6lle of Sussex, Ceawlin of Wessex, \u00c6thelberht of Kent, R\u00e6dwald of East-Anglia, Eadwine, Oswald, and Oswiu of Northumberland, as having a supremacy, if not over all Britain, yet at least beyond their own immediate kingdoms. This supremacy he first calls Imperium and then Ducatus. The latter somewhat lowly form may perhaps be a warning against attaching any exaggerated importance to the other. The Chroni clers translate the \" Imperium hujusmodi \" of B\u00e6da by the words \" pus mieel rice.\" They record Ecgberht's conquest of Mercia, and say that \" he w\u00e6s se eahtejsa cyning se pe Bretwalda w\u00e6s.\" They then give B\u00e6da's list of seven, with Ecgberht for the eighth. It is of course an obvious difficulty that several Kings, especially of Mercia, who seem to have been at least as powerful as any of those on the list, such as Penda and Offa, and \u00c6thelbald, whom Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 728 D) speaks of as \"rex regum,\" are not found on the list. The writer of the entry, a subject of Ecgberht or one of his successors, no doubt simply copied B\u00e6da's list and added the name of Ecgberht, unwilling perhaps to record the glories of princes of the rival kingdom. Now this objection quite upsets the old notion with which Mr. Kemble makes himself so merry, of a regular Federal monarchy under an elective Emperor or Bretwalda ; nor do I attempt to be wise above what is written or to define anything with precision as to the nature of a supremacy of which we have such slight records. Still the passages both"], [599, "THE BRETWALDADOM AND THE IMPERIAL TITLES. 551 in B\u00e6da and the Chronicles must have a meaning. They show that those seven Kings did exercise a supremacy of some kind beyond the limits of their own kingdoms, which supremacy Ecg berht was held to have continued or to have revived. This supremacy is equally a fact whether those seven princes bore any special title or not. That the Bretwaldadom of \u00c6thelberht car ried with it some real dominion beyond the limits of Kent is shown by the ease with which Augustine went and held a synod in a distant part of England and a part still heathen. (See B\u00e6da, ii. 2.) This could hardly be except by virtue of a safe conduct from the common overlord. Indeed B\u00e6da's words are explicit \u2014 \" adjutorio usus \u00c6dilbercti regis.\" The supremacy of Ecgberht needs no comment, and Mr. Kemble himself (ii. 19) calls attention to the fact that Ducatus, one of the words used by B\u00e6da, is used by Ecgberht himself in three charters (Cod. Dipl. vi. 79, 81, 84), in which Ecgberht dates the year of his Ducatus ten years later than the beginning of his reign as King, exactly like the years of the Regnum and the Imperium of the later Emperors. I believe then there was a real, though not an abiding or a very well defined, supremacy which was often, perhaps generally, held by some one of the Teutonic princes of Britain over as many of his neighbours, Celtic and Teutonic alike, as he could extend it over. I believe that this fact was remembered in the days of Ecgberht and of \u00c6thelstan, and that \u00c6thelstan probably looked on himself as the successor of Ceawlin in his wider no less than in his narrower dominion. What I cannot bring myself to believe is that Ceawlin looked on himself as the successor of Maximus and Carausius. Sir Francis Palgrave (i. 398) really seems to have believed that \u00c6lle the South-Saxon, the first recorded Bretwalda, was called to the post of Emperor of Britain by the choice of the Welsh princes. Now it is not easy to see in what \u00c6lle's Bretwaldadom consisted. It is possible that the Jutes of Kent, and the settlers who had already begun to make the east coast of Britain a Teutonic land, may have invested him with some sort of general leadership for the better carrying on of the Conquest. It is possible that he may have brought under tribute some Welsh tribes which he did not root out, and that he may so far have presented a dim foreshadowing of the glories of \u00c6thelstan and Eadgar. But the days of the Commend ation had not yet come. It is utterly incredible that \u00c6lle held"], [600, "552 APPENDIX. any authority over any Welsh tribe, save such as he won and held at the point of the sword. It is utterly incredible that any Welsh congress ever assembled to make him C\u00e6sar, Augustus, Tyrant, Bretwalda, or anything else. Cnut and William indeed were chosen Kings of the English by electors, many of whom must have shared as unwillingly in their work as any Welsh prince could have shared in the work of investing \u00c6lle with an Imperial crown. But the times were utterly different ; Cnut and William were not mere destroyers; they took possession of an established kingdom, and it was not their policy to destroy or to change one whit more than was absolutely necessary for their own purposes. But \u00c6lle, who did to Anderida as Joshua did to Jericho and to Ai, was little likely indeed to receive an Imperial diadem at the hands of the surviving Gibeonites. The dream of a transmission of Imperial authority from the vanquished Briton to his Teutonic conqueror seems to me the vainest of all the dreams which in genious men have indulged in. What then was the Bretwaldadom 1 As we may fairly assert that the passages which I have already quoted imply a real supremacy of some kind, so, on the other hand, we may be equally sure that whatever they imply was something of purely English growth, something in no way connected with, or derived from, any older Welsh or Roman dominion. Nothing is proved by the fact that \u00c6thelberht imitated the coinage of Carausius and put a wolf and twins on his money. Nothing was more common than for the Teutonic states everywhere, and for the Saracen states too, to imitate the coinage which supplied them with their most obvious models. But on a coin of Carausius the wolf and twins had a most speaking meaning ; on a coin of \u00c6thelberht they had no meaning at all. It may be that Eadwine assumed some ensigns of dignity in imitation of Roman pomp ; the tufa, may have the special meaning attached to it, or it may not; Eadwine, with the Roman Paulinus at his elbow, might well indulge in a certain Imperial show, without any need of traditions handed on from Maximus and Carausius. These are, I believe, the only attempts at evidence to prove that the Bretwaldadom had a Roman origin ; and they prove about as much as King \u00c6lfred's notion (see his Laws, Thorpe, i. 58) that the immemorial Teutonic (or rather Aryan, see H. ix. 629) practice of the ivergild was introduced by"], [601, "THE BRETWALDADOM AND THE IMPERIAL TITLES. 553 Christian Bishops in imitation of the mild-heartedness of Christ. The title of Bretwalda, or Brytenwealda, as borne by \u00c6thelstan, was most likely equivalent to Imperator or Basileus ; but if it was used by \u00c6lle or Ceawlin, I cannot think that it had any such meaning in their day. It does not however seem that the supremacy of the early Bretwaldas necessarily reached over the whole of Britain or even over the whole of the Teutonic kingdoms in Britain. A marked predominance in the island, a distinct superiority over other states than his own, seems to have been enough to win for a prince a place on the list as given by B\u00e6da and the Chro- nicler, though there might be other states over which his dominion did not reach. The supremacy of \u00c6lle, and even that of Ceawlin, must have been very far from reaching over all Britain. The supremacy of \u00c6thelberht is expressly limited by B\u00e6da (ii. 5) to the English states south of the Humber ; \" Tertius in regibus gentis Anglorum cunctis australibus eorum provinciis qu\u00e6 Hum- bra fluvio et contiguis ei terminis sequestrantur a borealibus, imperavit.\" This excludes all the Celts and also the Northum- brians. And it is worth noting that at least this same extent of dominion is elsewhere (v. 23) attributed by B\u00e6da to \u00c6thelbald of Mercia, whose name does not appear on his list ; \" H\u00e6 omnes provinci\u00e6 [all England east of Severn and Hereford west of it] c\u00e6ter\u00e6que australes ad confinium usque Hymbr\u00e6 fluminis, cum suis qu\u00e6que regibus, Merciorum regi \u00c6dilbaldo subject\u00e6 sunt.\" On the other hand, the dominion of Eadwine is distinctly said not to have taken in Kent, and it seems implied that it did not take in the Picts and Scots ; \" Aeduini . . . majore potentia cunctis qui Brittaniam incolunt, Anglorum pariter et Brettonum populis pr\u00e6- fuit, pr\u00e6ter Cantuariis tantum.\" Sir Francis Palgrave indeed (ii. cccix.) attributes to Eadwine a dominion over the Picts and Scots. The words of B\u00e6da however seem to me to exclude it ; I understand him as attributing to Eadwine a dominion over the Britons only, that is the Welsh (probably of Strathclyde), as distinguished from the Picts and Scots. And the words which follow might seem to imply that Oswiu was the first to extend the power of Northumberland beyond the Forth. After describing the dominion of Eadwine he adds, \" Sextus Oswald et ipse Nordan hymbrorum rex Christianissimus, iisdem finibus regnum tenuit ;"], [602, "554 APPENDIX. Septimus Osuiu frater ejus, \u00e6qualibus pene terminis regnum nonnullo tempore coercens, Pictorum quoque atque Scottorum gentes, qu\u00e6 septemtrionales Brittani\u00e6 fines tenent, maxima ex parte perdomuit ac tributarias fecit.\" So afterwards (iii. 24), \" Osuiu . . . qui gentem Pictorum maxima ex parte regno Anglorum subjecit.\" Yet elsewhere (iii. 6) he attributes to Oswald also a dominion over Picts and Scots ; \" Denique omnes nationes et provincias Brittani\u00e6, qu\u00e6 in quatuor linguas, id est Brettonum, Pictorum, Scottorum, et Anglorum, divis\u00e6 sunt, in ditione accepit.\" It should be remembered that there was a family connexion between the Pictish royal family and that of Bernicia, and the words just quoted might imply a voluntary acceptance of Oswald on the part of the northern tribes. The peculiarity of Ecgberht' s position was that he had received a formal submission from all the English princes in Britain, and that he was able to do what no other Bretwalda had done, to hand on his power to his children. This dominion Eadward and \u00c6thelstan won back and strengthened after the Danish invasion, and extended it over Scotland and Strathclyde. Now begins the use of the Imperial style, and I accordingly go on to give some examples of the various titles assumed by our Kings from \u00c6thelstan to Cnut. One such instance, that in which \u00c6thelstan uses the title of \" Brytenwealda,\" I have already quoted (see above, p. 367). Among the others I select such as either illustrate the use of the Latin Imperial titles, or which distinctly claim a dominion beyond the English kingdom, or which are remarkable on some other ground. I shall abstain from quoting those which present nothing beyond the mere use of the word Basileus, which is almost as common as Rex. Those which are found in charters marked by Mr. Kemble with an asterisk I mark with an asterisk also. 1.

Of these forms, Nos. 10, 11, 13 are used over and over again with various slight changes. The forms \" totius Britanni\u00e6 \" or \"Albionis rex\" or \"Basileus\" occur constantly. They are dis tinctly more common than the simple \" Anglorum rex.\" \" Anglo rum Basileus \" and forms to the like effect are also common. In fact a charter which does not in one way or the other assert a dominion beyond the simple royalty of the English nation is rather the exception. On the other hand we now and then, as in Nos. 21, 32, come upon forms which are startling from their very simplicity. No. 32, I suppose, belongs to the days when Eadwig was reduced to the kingdom of Wessex. Meanwhile Eadgar in his Mercian charter, No. 38, seems to claim, what doubtless was the case, the external dominion of the crown as belonging to himself rather than to his West-Saxon brother. Nos. 14, 15, 16, 18, 27, 50 are re markable for the use of the word \"Angli\" and \" Angulseaxe\" in a sense excluding Northumberland. In No. 14 indeed \"Angli\" ex cludes the Mercians. It might be almost rendered \" Saxons.\" So completely had \" Anglus\" become the national name, even in the most purely Saxon parts of the country. Some of these titles call for some special notice. Brytenwealda I have already spoken of. No. 19 is remarkable as the only one in which the title of C\u00e6sar occurs in any shape. Casere is the regular English description of the continental Emperors, but I know no other instance of its application to an English King. (Perhaps the most striking instance of its use is where \u00c6lfred in his Boetius"], [607, "THE BRETWALDADOM AND THE IMPERIAL TITLES. 559 calls Odysseus \" an cyning p\u00e6s nama Aulixes, se h\u00e6fde twa pioda under pani kasere . . . and p\u00e6s kaseres nama w\u00e6s Agamemnon.\") This solitary English use of the word is a remarkable contrast to the fact that Kaiser altogether dis2)laced Kbnig as the title of the German sovereign. In fact none of these titles ever came into common use, even in Latin, much less in English. Basileus, so common in charters, is very rare anywhere else. It occurs twice in Florence, once (975) where Eadgar is called \"Anglici orbis Basileus,\" and again (10 16) where Eadric at Sherstone is made to talk of \"dominus vester Eadmundus Basileus;'\" and once in the Ramsey History, c. 87, where the writer speaks of \" \u00c6dgari victoriosissimi Anglorum Basilei muni ficentia regalis.\" Imperator, less rare than C\u00e6sar, is less usual than Basileus. Pr\u0153dux in No. 39 reminds one of the ducatus of B\u00e6da and of Ecgberht' s charters (see above, p. 551). The oddest titles of all are Primicerius and Curagulus or Coregulus. Pro bably Curagulus means caretaker, but with the idea of Rex or Regulus floating in the mind of the scribe, which accounts for the spelling Coregulus. I am uncertain whether the words monarchus, monarchia, are to be reckoned as strictly Imperial. They are so used by Dante in his famous treatise \" De Monarchia ; \" but it is clear that they have no such special meaning in the rhetoric of Dudo. They may have been used with equal vagueness in the kindred rhetoric of our charters. Thus for instance in a doubtful grant of Eadgar, dated 958, in possession of the Chapter of Wells, Eadgar is made to call himself \" Rex Merciorum et NorSanbym brorum atque Brettonum ; \" and afterwards, \" divina favente gratia totius regni Merciorum monarchiam obtinens.\" That of these titles Casere, Basileus, and Imperator are meant to be Imperial in the strictest sense I have no doubt. If the title of Basileus stood alone, it might possibly be merely an instance of the prevalent fondness for Greek titles ; the King might be called Basileus only in the same vague way in which his Ealdormen are called satrap\u0153 and archontes. Yet even this would be unlikely ; satrapa and archon were not established titles, assumed by a single potentate in a special sense, and which the diplomacy of the age confined to that potentate. But Basileus was simply Greek for Imperator. To be addressed as Imperator and Basileus by the ambassadors of Nikephoros (Einhard, an. 812. \" Laudes et"], [608, "560 APPENDIX. dixerunt, Imperatorem eum et Basileum appellantes \") is reckoned among the most brilliant triumphs of Charles the Great. It was the formal acknowledgment of the claims of the Western C\u00e6sar at the hands of his Eastern colleague or rival. So, later in the ninth century, the title of Basileus became the subject of a curious diplo matic controversy between the rival claimants of the dignity which it denoted, Basil of the New, and Lewis of the Old, Rome, and the Western disputant went very deep into the matter indeed. (See the letter of Lewis, \" Imperator Augustus Romanorum,\" to Basil, \" \u00e6que Imperator Nov\u00e6 Rom\u00e6,\" in the Chronicle of Salerno, cap. 93 et seqq. ; Muratori, t. ii. p. ii. p. 243. See Comparative Politics, 49> 353-) So Liudprand (Legatio, c. 2) complains that the Nike phoros of his day refused the title to Otto ; \" Ipse enim vos non Imperatorem, id est (Saai\\ca sua lingua, sed ob indignationem pr/ya, id est Regem nostra vocabat.\" So late as John Kinnamos, lib. v. 9 (pp. 228, 229, ed. Bonn), Frederick Barbarossa is only p'i)\u00a3 'AXapavav ; the Eastern Emperor alone is Pao-i\\cis and avroKparap. That the titles Casere and Imperator are strictly Imperial hardly needs proof; the only question is whether we are to look for a strictly Imperial meaning in every instance of the use of the noun imperium and the verb imperare. The use of Basileus seems more common in England than any where else ; yet we find it in Abbo (i. 43) of Charles the Third ; \" Urbs mandata suit Karolo nobis Basileo, Imperio cujus regitur totus prope kosmus, Post Dominum, regem dominatoremque potentem. Imperator (see Ducange, in voc.) seems to have been used by several Kings of Castile, on precisely the same ground on which it was used in England, namely that they were Emperors, inde pendent of Rome or Byzantium, but holding an Imperial power over princes within their own peninsula. So Robert de Monte, 11 53 (Pertz, vi. 503), \" Quia principatur regulis Arragonum et Gallici\u00e6, Imperatorem Hispaniarum appellant.\" The West Frank ish and French instances which Ducange quotes seem very doubtful. Charles the Bald, it must be remembered, really was Emperor in his last years. The oddest thing of all is the fact that the Saxon Kings Henry and Otto were saluted Imperator by their soldiers in the sense of the days of the Roman Republic. See Widukind, i. 39 ; iii. 49. Henry was \"pater patri\u00e6, rerum dominus et Imperator ab"], [609, "THE BRETWALDADOM AND THE IMPERIAL TITLES. 561 exercitu appellatus ; \" Otto \" triumpho celebri rex factus gloriosus, ab exercitu pater patri\u00e6 Imperatorque appellatus est.\" (See p. 143.) In this sense not only C\u00e6sar, but Cicero also was Emperor. Per haps the strangest description of all is that of Charles the Fat in Will. Malms, ii. in, \"Ego Karolus imperator, gratuito Dei dono rex Germanorum et patricius Romanorum, atque imperator Fran corum.\" It is worth noticing that, though some of the most distinctly Imperial descriptions are found in charters whose genuineness is undoubted, yet the proportion of them which are found in doubtful or spurious charters is remarkably large. This fact in no way tells against the Imperial theory, but rather in its favour. A forger will naturally reproduce whatever he thinks most characteristic of the class of documents which he is imitating ; but, in so doing, he is likely somewhat to overdo matters. A forger, thus attempting to copy the style of a charter of Eadgar or \u00c6thelred, perhaps actually reproducing a genuine charter from memory, would natu rally fill his composition with the most high-sounding of all the titles that he had ever seen in any genuine charter. The most purely Imperial style would thus find its way into forgeries in greater abundance than into genuine charters. Still the spurious documents are, in this way, evidence just as much as the genuine ones. The doubtful and spurious charters have therefore a certain value ; their formulae are part of the case, and I have not scrupled to add them to my list. With regard to the assertion of the Imperial character of English royalty in later times, the doubtful title of \" monarcha \" or \" mon arches \" still goes on. Thus in the charter of William Rufus to John of Tours, preserved in manuscript at Wells, the King is described as \" Willelmus Willelmi regis filius, Dei dispositions monarches Britan ni\u00e6.\" So, long after, in a letter from Henry the Sixth to James the Second of Scotland (correspondence of Thomas Bekynton, ii. 141), the English King is made to say, \" verum et notorium est supremum jus et directum dominium regni Scoti\u00e6 ad regem Angli\u00e6 utpote totius Britanni\u00e6 monarcham de jure pertinere.\" So in i. 119 of the same collection, where Henry the Sixth petitions Pope Eugenius the Fourth for the canonization of \u00c6lfred, the West-Saxon King is de scribed as \" Sanctus et Deo devotissimus rex Aluredus, qui incliti regni Angli\u00e6 primus monarcha erat.\" It was also held necessary at VOL. I. 0 0"], [610, "562 APPENDIX. various times to deny any superiority of the continental Emperors over England. Thus it was declared in Edward the Second's reign (1330), \"Quod regnum Angli\u00e6 ab omni subjectione Imperiali sit liberrimum \" (Selden, Titles of Honour, p. 2 1. b. i. c. 2). And in 1416a renunciation of all supremacy was required from Sigismund, King of the Romans, before he was allowed to land in England (see Selden, u. s. ; Lingard, iii. 505 ; Bryce, 207. But the account in Redman, p. 49, and Elmham, Liber. Metr. p. 133, is much less explicit). So late as Elizabeth's reign, Sir Thomas Smith, in his Commonwealth of England (10), describing the union of the English kingdoms into one, goes on to explain that \"neither anyone of those Kings, neither he who first had all, tooke any investiture at the hands of the Emperor of Rome, or of any other superiour or forraine Prince, but held of God to himselfe, and by his sword, his people, and crowne, acknowledging no Prince in earth his superiour, and so it is kept and holden at this day.\" But beside this denial of all Imperial supremacy anywhere else, we also find the Imperial character of our sovereigns from Edward the First to Elizabeth from time to time directly asserted. Thus there are two cases in which the title of Emperor is given to Edward the First, in both cases with distinct reference to his supremacy over Scot land. The elder Robert Bruce (Palgrave, Documents, p. 29) claimed the kingdom from Edward the First as Emperor. \" Sire Robert de Brus .... prie a nostre Seignur le Rey, come son sovereyn Seigneur e son Empeur!' So when the question is raised whether the controversy between the candidates for the Scottish crown should be judged by the Imperial law or by any other, one of the Prelates consulted (\" episcopus Bibliensis,\" perhaps a Bishop of Byblos in partibus) answers that the King of England must follow the law of his own realm because \"he is Emperor here\" (Rishanger, Riley, p. 255). \"Dixit quod dominus rex secundum leges per quas judicat subjectos suos debet procedere in casu isto, quia hie censetur Imperator.\" So Professor Stubbs (Const. Hist. ii. 491) quotes a statute of 1397 in which Richard the Second is described as \"entier emperour de son roialme.\" The title is also challenged for Henry the Fifth in a negociation at the siege of Rouen. In the riming Chronicle of John Page (Historical Col lections of a Citizen of London, Camden Society, 1876) an English knight is made to say of his own King,"], [611, "THE BRETWALDADOM AND THE IMPERIAL TITLES. 563 \"And he ys kyng excellent, And unto non othyr obedyent, That levythe here in erthe be ryght, But only unto God almyght, With-yn hys owne Emperoure, And also kyng and conqueroure.\" In Henry the Eighth's time the words \"Empire\" and \"Imperial Crown \" are constantly used in a way which cannot fail to be of set purpose. The Statute of Appeals of 1537, in renouncing all jurisdiction on the part of the Roman Pontiff, clothed the renun ciation in words whose force can hardly be misunderstood, and which seem designed expressly to exclude the supremacy of the Roman C\u00e6sar as well. The emphatic words run thus ; \" Whereas by divers and sundry old authentic histories and chronicles, it is manifestly declared and expressed that this realm of England is an Empire, and so hath been accepted in the world ; governed by one supreme head and King, having the dignity and royal estate of ilie Imperial Grown of the same .... without restraint, or provocation to any foreign prince or potentate of the world.\" So again, \"to keep it from the annoyance as well of the See of Rome as from the authority of other foreign potentates attempting the diminution Or violation thereof\" (Selden, p. 18; Froude, Hist. Eng. i. 410-412). In an Irish Act of the same reign a further step is taken, and the King is distinctly spoken of as Emperor. As Selden (u. s.) puts it, \" The Crown of England in other Parlia ments of later times is titled the Imperial Crown ; the Kings of England being also in the express words of an Irish Parliament titled Kings and Emperours of the Realm of England and of the Land of Ireland, and that before the title of Lord of Ireland was allied with King.\" As for Elizabeth, at her coronation her herald formally proclaimed her as \" most worthy Empress from the Orcade isles to the mountains Pyrenee.\" (See Strickland's Life of Eliza beth, p. 166, where a very strange interpretation is put on the words.) \" The mountains Pyrenee \" are a flourish which seems to have come from the days of Henry the Second, when Gilbert Foliot (Ralph of Diss, X Scripts. 542) speaks of \" dominationis su\u00e6 loca qu\u00e6 ab boreali oceano Piren\u00e6um usque porrecta sunt.\" (So William of Newburgh, i. 94.) And the special mention of the \"Orcade isles\" might seem to come out of a charter of \u00c6thelred (Cod. 0 0 a"], [612, "APPENDIX. 564 Dipl. iii. 346) ; \" Angligenum, Orcadarum necne in gyro jacentium monarchus.\" So in 1559, in the debate on restoring to the Crown the ecclesiastical jurisdiction surrendered under Mary, those who opposed Elizabeth's spiritual claims still pointedly admitted her Imperial position in temporal matters. Archbishop Heath says, \" She being our Sovereign Lord and Lady, our King and Queen, our Emperor and Empress, other Kings and Princes of duty ought to pay tribute unto her, she being free from them all\" (Strype's Annals, I. Append. No. 6). And in the first English translation of Camden's Britannia (London, 1625), the title of the book is given as \" The true and Royall history of the famous Empresse Elizabeth, Queen of England.\" Lastly, a pamphlet was published in 1706, when the Union with Scotland was under debate, headed, \" The Queen an Empress, and her three kingdoms an Empire,\" proposing a curious scheme for a British Empire, with subordinate Kings, Princes, and a Patriarch of London. It is of course an imitation of the constitution of the Empire, but the writer refers once or twice to the days of Eadgar for precedents. The Imperial position of the English King seemed naturally (see p. 1 34) to carry with it the Papal position of the English Primate. Britain is another world, a world beyond the sea, distinct from the \"orbis Romanus.\" On this head I have collected a good many ex tracts in Comparative Politics, 351. So Eumenius Constantio, Pan. Vet. v. 11 ; \"Quam C\u00e6sar, ille auctor vestri nominis, eum Roman orum primus intrasset, alium se orbem terrarum scripsit reperisse, tant\u00e6 magnitudinis arbitratus, ut non circumfusa oceano sed com plexa ipsum oceanum videretur.\" (Cf. R. de Diceto, i. 438, ed. Stubbs.) As another world then, Britain is entitled to its own C\u00e6sar, \" mundi dominus \" within his own four seas, and no less to its own Pontiff. As Florence (see above, p. 559) calls Eadgar \" Anglici orbis Basileus,\" and as in No. 1 2 of our extracts we heard of \" totius Britanni\u00e6 orbis,\" evidently in this sense, so Pope Urban (Eadmer, Vit. Ans. ii. c. 4) salutes Anselm with an analogous title, as \" com parem vel ut alterius orbis apostolicum et patriarcham jure vene randum,\" or as William of Malmesbury (Gest. Pont. ap. Scripts, p. Bed. 127) puts it still more strongly, \" Includamus hunc in orbe nostro, quasi alterius orbis pap>am.\" The same idea, one degree"], [613, "EARLY RELATIONS WITH THE CONTINENT. 565 less strongly expressed, is found in William of Jumieges' (vi. 9) description of Lanfranc as \" gentium transmarinarum summus pon tifex.\" This of course connects itself with the not uncommon description of England and the English King as \" parses trans marin\u00e6,\" \"rex transmarinus,\" &c. See for instance Flodoard, A. 945. So, on the other side, in the Fulda Annals, 876 (Pertz, i. 389), \" Karolus .... ablato regis nomine, se Imperatorem et Augustum omnium regem cis mare consistentium appellare pr\u00e6cepit.\" I have thus, I trust, brought together quite evidence enough to show what was the meaning and purpose of the Imperial style which was anciently adopted by our Kings, and distinct traces of which still survive in more than one familiar expression to this day. I do not doubt that other scholars, in their several lines of study, must often light on other passages bearing on the subject. I will wind up with one more, not the least remarkable of the number, that in which Abbot Baldric, the poetical panegyrist of the great men of bis day, describes (Duchesne, Rer. Franc. Scriptt. iv. 257) the great William as one \"Qui dux Normannis, qui C\u00e6sar pr\u00e6fuit Anglis.\" NOTE C. p. 30. The Early Relations between England and the Continent. The notices of Britain between the time of the English Con quest and the conversion of the English to Christianity are indeed few and far between. They are chiefly to be found in an episode of Prokopios (Beil. Goth. iv. 20), from which I have made two quotations in the text (pp. 22, 30). That the Brittia of Prokopios is Britain, and not, as Dr. Latham (Diet. Geog., art. Britannic\u00e6 Insul\u00e6) fancies, Heligoland, Rugen, or some other island, I have no kind of doubt, and Mr. Kemble seems not to have entertained any. The difficulty is what his Brettania is. It strikes me that he had heard both of the continental and the insular Britannia, and that he fancied them to be two islands. His Brittia therefore"], [614, "APPENDIX. 566 is Britain and his Brettania is Britanny. (Cf. Zeuss, Die Deutschen, 362; \"BpiTTia, Britannia, und Bpirawla, Hibernia, wahrscheinlich durch Vermengung mit Britannia cismarina, Bretagne.\") John Kin namos (ii. 12, p. 67 ed. Bonn), ranks Bplmoi Kal Bperavol among the Crusaders. Allowing for the primary error of fancying Britanny to be an island, his geographical description is really not so monstrous as might be thought. His well-known story about the souls of the dead being ferried over to Brittia, and his confused and marvellous account of the Roman wall, show how strange and mysterious a land Britain had already become. But the two passages which I have quoted are distinct and intelligible. For an island inhabited by Angles, Frisians, and Britons we need not go far afield. Prokopios tells us nothing of the process by which these three nations came into the island. There is, as far as I know, only one foreign notice of the English Conquest, which is however probably contemporary with one stage or another of it. This is in the Chronicon Imperiale of Prosper (see Diet. Biog. and Potthast's Wegiueiser in Prosper), written either in the fifth or in the sixth century. Here we have two entries (Duchesne, Rer. Franc. Scripts. i. 198, 199; M. H. B. lxxxii.); the former saying that \"hac tem pestate [the time of Constantine the Tyrant, 407-411 ; cf. Zosimos, vi. 5], pr\u00e6 valitudine Romanorum, vires funditus attenuat\u00e6 Bri tanni\u00e6.\" The other says that, some time before the death of Aetius in 454, \"Britanni\u00e6 usque ad hoc tempus variis cladibus eventibusque lacerat\u00e6, in ditionem Saxonum rediguntur.\" I am however not sure that Prokopios has not a dark aud confused allusion to the Armorican migration when he speaks of vast numbers of people coming from Britain to settle in the land of the Franks, on the strength of which it was that the Frankish Kings claimed the dominion of the island (roo-aurn f] ravSe tS>v i8va>v Tro\\vav8pamla (paiverat overa wore ava nav eros Kara iroWovs ivdevSe fieravio-Tcipevoi \u00a3iv yvvaigl Kal naio-lv es $pdyyovs x<upoC,f7U\\ 01 8e airoiis evoiKi^ovciv iv yrjs tijs ocpeTepas tiji/ ipnporepav SoKovcrav clvai, Kal cm' avrov rijv vr)<jov nposiroieio-Bai cpaciv). In an earlier passage Prokopios makes Belisarios (ii. 6) make the Goths the offer of Bretannia as an island much larger than Sicily. This is evidently in mockery, and it seems to imply that both Britain and Britanny were looked on as lands which had quite passed out of all practical reckoning on the part of the Empire."], [615, "EARLY RELATIONS WITH THE CONTINENT. 567 Prokopios goes on, in the same chapter, to tell a long story, which is discussed by Mr. Kemble (Saxons in England, i. 23 ; cf. Zeuss, Die Deutschen, 362), of an English princess (napdivov nopr/s, ytvovs BpiTTiac, . . . .Inrr-nsp abeXtpos /ifao-iXeuc rjv totc Ayyt\\<ov tov Wvovs), who was betrothed to Radiger, son of the King of the Varni, who, on his father's death, instead of fulfilling his engage ment, married his father's widow, a sister of Theodberht, King of the Pranks, who reigned from 534 to 537. The incestuous marriage, which was repeated in after days by Eadbald of Kent and \u00c6thelbald of Wessex, is expressly said to have been contracted in obedience to the dying commands of Radiger's father (cf. Soph. Trach. 1 199-1207), by the advice of his chief men, and in con formity with the custom of the nation (xadinep 6 Trdrpios ggXv t'cplgo-i uopns). The English princess however gathers a vast fleet and army, takes with her one of her brothers, not the King, as its commander, sails to the mouth of the Rhine, fights a battle, defeats Radiger, and compels him to send away his step-mother and marry her. The tale, which is told in great detail, is doubtless mythical in its details ; but we may, with Mr. Kemble, accept it as pointing to the possibility of some intercourse, both peaceful and warlike, between the insular and the continental Teutons. But I cannot follow Mr. Kemble when he goes on (i. 25) to build up, on the expressions of a German ecclesiastical writer, a theory of insular Saxons aiding the Frank Theodoric in a war with the Thuringians. The author of the Translation of Saint Alexander (Pertz, ii. 674) is not speaking of any particular detachment of Saxons from Britain coming over to Germany to take a part in a particular war. By a strange perversion, this writer of the ninth century derives the continental Saxons, as a nation, from the English in Britain ; \"Saxonum gens, sicut tradit antiquitas, ab Anglis Britannia? incolis egressa, per Oceanum navigans Germanise litoribus studio et necessitate qu\u00e6rendarum sedium appulsa est.\" On this the editor remarks, \"More solito traditio res gestas invertit, ita ut Saxones non e Saxonia Britanniam, sed ex Britannia Saxoniam appulisse dicantur.\" The legend is no doubt a corruption of the legendary origin of the Saxons given by Widukind, i. 3-6. On the sense in which the English had a better right to the name* of \" Old-Saxons \" than the Saxons on the continent, see Zeuss, Die Deutschen, 188. I"], [616, "APPENDIX. 568 It is worth remarking that Jordanes, though he devotes his second chapter to a description of Britain, simply gives an account patched up from C\u00e6sar, Livy, Strabo, and Dio, and seems to describe the Britons as still the inhabitants of the island, without any reference to the settlement of the English. He makes another reference to Britain in his fifth chapter, but it is of a purely mythical kind. I doubt whether there is any mention of England in Gregory of Tours, except in the two passages where he records the marriage of \u00c6thelberht with the daughter of Chariberht. He does not use the words Saxon, Angle, or Britain, but he speaks of Kent as if the name were familiarly known. \" Charibertus . . . filiam habuit qu\u00e6 postea in Cantiam, virum accipiens, est deducta\" (iv. 26). So afterwards (ix. 26) he speaks of \"filiam unicam quam in Cantia regis cujusdam filius matrimonio copulavit.\" Coming down later among continental writers, there is a well known passage in the Annals of Einhard (A. 786) in which he speaks of the English Conquest and of the Armorican migration as its consequence. Charles leads his army \" in Brittanniam cis marinam,\" and the Annalist goes on to explain ; \" Nam quum ab Anglis ac Saxonibus Brittannia insula fuisset invasa, magna pars incolarum ejus mare trajiciens in ultimis Galli\u00e6 finihus Venetorum et Coriosolitarum regiones occupavit.\" There is another mention of the Armorican migration in Ermoldus Nigellus, iii. 1 1 (Pertz, ii. 49\u00b0)- Lantpreht (Lambert), whose command lies in Britanny, is thus described ; \"Pr\u00e6videt hie fines, quos olim gens inimica Trans mare lintre volans ceperat insidiis. Hie populus veniens supremo ex orbe Britanni, Quos modo Brittones Francica lingua vocat. Nam telluris egens, vento jactatus et imbri, Arva capit prorsus, atque tributa parat. Tempore nempe illo hoc rus quoque Gallus habebat, Quando idem populus fluctibus actus adest.\" On the whole it would seem that a certain amount of intercourse was kept up between the Franks in Gaul and the Southern English states, but that to the world in general Britain had become an unknown land about which any fables might be put forth."], [617, "RELATIONS OF CHARLES THE GREAT WITH BRITAIN. 569 NOTE D. p. 38. The Relations of Charles the Great with Mercia and Northumberland. All the passages bearing on the relations of Charles the Great with Mercia, Northumberland, and Scotland are collected by Sir Francis Palgrave, English Commonwealth, i. 484 et seqq. The cream of the matter is contained in the account given by Einhard, A. 808 ; \" Interea rex Nordanhumbrorum de Brittania insula, nomine Eardulf, regno et patria pulsus, ad Imperatorem dum adhuc Noviomagi moraretur venit, et patefacto adventus sui negotio, Romam proficiscitur Romaque rediens, per legatos Romani ponti ficis et domni Imperatoris in regnum suum reducitur.\" One of the legates was \" Aldulfus diaconus de ipsa Brittania, natione Saxo,\" spoken of in p. 534. That Eardwulf became the man of Charles there seems no doubt. Pope Leo says \"vester semper fidelis exstitit.\" The submission of the Scots is also mentioned by Einhard in the Life of Charles, c. 16; \" Scotorum quoque reges sic habuit ad suam voluntatem per munificentiam inclinatos, ut eum numquam aliter nisi dominum, seque subditos et servos ejus, pro nunciarent.\" One would suppose that the Scots both of Ireland and of Britain are included. This mention of the Scots comes between the dealings of Charles with Alfonso of Gallicia and those with Haroun al Rashid. The relation both of the Scots and of the Northumbrians seems to have been a relation of commendation, a term on which I shall presently have much to say. The Scots doing homage to Charles on account of his gifts is not unlike the homage which we shall find done by certain French princes to Eadward the Confessor. The relations between Charles and Offa, and their temporary difference, are also fully explained in the passages collected by Sir Francis Palgrave. A number of important letters will be found in Haddan and Stubbs, Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents, iii. 486 et seqq. ; Jaffe, Monumenta Alcuiniana, 155, 167, 290, et al. There is a long mythical account of it in the Vita Off\u00e6 Secundi, pp. 13 et seqq. From thence Sir F. Palgrave quotes the story that Arch bishop Janberht had promised to admit a Frankish army into"], [618, "570 APPENDIX. England (Vita Off\u00e6, 21). This is doubtless a good deal exag gerated, but notice should be taken of a very remarkable expression in the account given in Cod. Dipl. i. 281 of the relations between Ossa's successor Cenwulf and Archbishop Wulfred. It is plain that a deep impression had been made on the minds of Englishmen by the dealings of Charles in the matters of Eardwulf, Ealhwine, and Janberht ; \" Tune in eodem concilio cum maxima districtione illi episcopo mandavit quod omnibus rebus qu\u00e6 illius dominationis sunt dispoliatus debuisset fieri, omnique de patria ista esse profugus, et numquam nee verbis domni Pap\u00e6 nee G\u00e6saris seu alterius alicujus gradu hue in patriam iterum recipisse.\" Cenwulf clearly held that neither the Bishop of Rome nor the Emperor of Rome either had any jurisdiction in his realm of Mercia. The odd description of Offa as the Western and Charles as the Eastern potentate comes from a very suspicious source, namely the Life of Offa, p. 2 1 ; \" Ego Karolus regum Christianorum orientalium potentissimus, vos, O Offane, regum occidentalium Christianorum potentissime, cupio l\u00e6tificare,\" &c. But the expression is singular enough to be worth quoting, if only on account of its very singu larity, as it is the sort of thing which one can hardly fancy a forger inventing. The influence of Charles in English affairs is strangely exag gerated in a passage of John of Wallingford (Gale, 529) ; \"Rex Pipinus obiit regni ejus anno xii. Successitque Karolus filius ejus anno ab Incarnatione Domini dcclxix. Porro iste, sicut alia regna, sic et Angliam tempore hujus regis Off\u00e6 sibi subegit.\" The description of Offa in the Chronicle of Saint Wandrille (Pertz, ii. 291) as \"Rex Anglorum sive Merciorum potentissimus\" should be noticed. NOTE E. p. 48. The Changes in Nomenclature produced by the Danish Settlement. Mr. Kemble has gone (Saxons in England, i. 77-84) very minutely into the subject of the old divisions of England,- and he has collected a great number of names, some of which can be easily identified, while others can only be guessed at and some are"], [619, "NOMENCLATURE OF SHIRES. 571 quite hopeless. But it is plain (see Kemble, i. 78, 79) that the West-Saxon names, Wils\u00e6tas, Sumors\u00e6tas, Dorns\u00e6tas, are all older than \u00c6lfred's time, while the names of the present Mercian shires are later than \u00c6lfred, and have supplanted earlier names, as appears from Mr. Kemble 's list of old Mercian shires (i. 81), some of which are quite unintelligible. One or two very obvious instances will be enough for my purpose. Thus the principality of the Hwiccas has long formed two whole shires, Worcester and Gloucester, and part of another, Warwick. The Mages\u00e6tas seem to be divided between Herefordshire and Shropshire. Lincolnshire contains several prin cipalities, Gainas, Lindisfaras, &c, but the traces of their original independence are not wholly lost even at the present day. In Wessex most of the shires, Berkshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devonshire, are clearly not called from towns. Somerset and Dorset have cognate towns in Somerton and Dorchester ; but they are merely cognate ; the shire is not called after the town. But Hampshire, the County of Southampton, is simply Hamtunscir, from the town of Hampton. Hampshire was the first conquest ; no doubt it had originally no local name like the other shires, but was simply Westseaxe or Westseaxnarice. When therefore it became a mere shire, it had to take a new name, and was named from the town. It may be asked why the shire which contained the capital was called from the town of Hampton and not from the royal city of Winchester. I can only suggest that some prerogative of the crown or some privilege of the citizens may have kept the capital more distant from the body of the shire than Hampton was. Wiltshire is a case intermediate between Hampshire and Somerset. The Wils\u00e6tas are a tribe, and have their chief town Wilton. But the form Wiltunscir shows that the shire is immediately called from the town, whence the t in the modern form Wiltshire. In Mercia, on the other hand, all the shires are now called from towns with one, perhaps two exceptions. Shropshire seems to be rather cognate with Shrewsbury than directly derived from it, and alongside of Scrobbesbyrigscvr the Scrobs\u00e6tas continue to be heard of. Rutland, at once the smallest and the most modern of Mercian shires, is, oddly enough, the only one which has a distinct terri torial name, not even cognate with that of any town. Rutland, as a distinct shire, is later than Domesday, where it appears, strangely"], [620, "572 APPENDIX. enough, as a kind of appendage to Nottingham. How it gained the rank of a shire, while the adjoining and larger district of Holland did not, would he an interesting question for local antiquaries. I have no doubt that the Mercian shires were mapped out afresh after the reconquest. That the redistribution was not made by the Danish invaders is plain from the fact that the boundary laid down between Guthrum and \u00c6lfred is not attended to in marking out the divisions of the shires. We may conceive that the work was begun by \u00c6lfred, or rather perhaps by \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d in that part of Mercia which was assigned to them by the peace with Guthrum, and that it was further carried on by Eadward the Elder after the recovery of Danish Mercia. In this we may see the groundwork of the legendary belief that \u00c6lfred first divided England into shires and hundreds. With the shires within his own kingdom there was no need to meddle. Gneist (Englische Verwaltungsrecht, i. 56) enlarges on- the share of \u00c6lfred in this matter, but leaves out Eadward. As for the nomenclature of towns and villages, it would seem that places were more commonly named directly after individuals in the course of the Danish Conquest than they had been by the earlier English occupiers. At least, among the names given during the English occupation, those which are formed from the proper name itself are less common than those which are formed from the patronymic ending in -ing. These last again raise the question, how far they are called after historical individuals and how far they are tribe-names called after some mythical patriarch. This last view will be found discussed at length by Kemble, Saxons in England, i. 59 and Appendix A. (See also Comparative Politics, 395.) Names like Tooting, Bensin^/ton, Gillni^iham, give the typical forms. On the other hand (see Kemble's note, p. 60), it should be re membered that this familiar form ing, being so familiar, has often swallowed up others ; thus Ethandiin, \u00c6bbandun, Huntandiin, forms of quite different origin, have been corrupted into TZdington, Abinjrdon, Huntingdon. Hirvaingh&va again has been thought to to be a corruption of Bromicham, but Mr. Kemble (i. 457) admits it as a genuine patronymic from the Beormingas. On the other hand, Gl\u00e6stnw/abyrig, a genuine patronymic, has been corrupted into Glastonbury, and a wrong derivation given to the name."], [621, "\u00c6THELRED AND \u00c6THELFL\u00c6D OF MERCIA. 573 An exact parallel to the Danish system of nomenclature is supplied by a later and less known, though very remarkable, settle ment of the same kind, the Flemish occupation of Pembrokeshire in the twelfth century. The villages in the Teutonic part of that county bear names exactly analogous to those of Lincolnshire, only ending in the English ton instead of the Danish by. Such are Johnston, Williamston, Herbrandston, and a crowd of others. NOTE F. p. 54. \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d or Mercia. The Chronicles speak of \u00c6thelred as Ealdorman of that part of Mercia which was kept by \u00c6lfred, in 886, when London was entrusted to his keeping. See also the extract from Asser in Florence, where he is described as \" Merciorum comes.\" He married \u00c6lfred's daughter \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, and he appears, even in the older state of things in Mercia, to have held a special position under Burhred, as in a charter in Cod. Dipl. ii. 99, confirmed by \" Burhred rex Merciorum,\" he describes himself as \"\u00c6Selred Deo adjuvante Merciorum dux,\" a title which suggests those of \" Fran corum\" and \" Anglorum dux.\" His reappointment by \u00c6lfred must have been one of the King's first acts after the peace with Guthrum, as we find a charter of his of the year 880 in Cod. Dipl. ii. 107, in which his style runs thus; \"Ego \u00c6tSelred, gratia Domini largiflua concedente, dux et patricius gentis Merciorum cum licentia et impositione mamis \u00c6lfredi regis, una cum testi monio et consensu seniorum ejusdem gentis episcoporum vel principum, pro redemptione animarum nostrarum et pro sospitate necnon et stabilitate regni Merciorum.\" So in a charter of 883 (Cod. Dipl. ii. no), which begins in Latin and goes on in English, and which even in the English part comes nearer than usual to the inflated style of the Latin documents ; \" Ic \u00c6Selr\u00e6d ealdorman inbyrdendre Godes gefe gewelegod and gewlenced mid sume dale Mercna rices .... mid \u00c6lfredes cyninges lease and gewitnesse, and mid ealra Myrcna witena godcundra hada and woroldcundra.\" The words \"sume d\u00e6le \" seem to mark \u00c6thelred as holding a smaller territorial jurisdiction under \u00c6lfred than he had held"], [622, "APPENDIX. 574 under Burhred, and the formula reminds one of Cnut's style (Florence 103 1); \"Rex totius Angli\u00e6 et Denemarci\u00e6 et Norre ganorum et partis Suanorum.\" Mercia however is still a kingdom, like Ireland up to 1801, and \u00c6thelred looks very like a Lord Lieutenant holding an Irish Parliament. Heming's Worcester Cartulary (93) records another Mercian Gemot held by \u00c6thelred; \"pa r5e gere gebeon \u00c6Selred alderman alle Mercna weotan to somne to Gleaweceastre biscopas and aldermen and all his dugucSe, and ]?\u00e6t dyde be \u00c6lfredes cyninges gewitnesse and lease.\" The position of \u00c6thelred in Mercia is thus described by William of Malmesbury (ii. 125); \"Hie [Elfredus] duo regna Mercionmi et West-Saxonum conjunxerit, Merciorum nomine tenus, quippe commendatum duci Etheredo, tenens.\" He had already said (ii. 121), \" Londoniam, caput regni Merciorum [\" caput regni, Merciorum \" ?] cuidam primario Etheredo in fidelitatem suam cum filia Ethelfl\u00e6di concessit.\" This use of \"regnum\" is like the use of the same word as applied to Bavaria under the Agilolfing Dukes. (See Waitz, iii. 302.) It may perhaps be thought that \u00c6thelred and the Lady felt themselves more nearly on an equality with their brother than they had done with their father; at least in a charter of 901 (Cod. Dipl. ii. 136) they seem to assume a more royal style ; \" \u00c6Selred \u00c6tS[elfl\u00e6dque o]pitulante gratuita Dei gratia monarchiam Mercio rum tenentes honorificeque gubernantes et defendentes.\" And it may be a sign of a higher rank that \u00c6thelred, who in \u00c6lfred's time (as in 886) is called only Ealdorman, in Ead ward's reign is twice called \" Myrcna hlaford \" in the Chronicles. One time is in 911, when his death is recorded (though he is called \"Ealdorman\" in other entries of the same event), and again in 919, when his daughter \u00c6lfwyn is spoken of. Florence too in 912 calls him \" dux et patricius, dominus et subregulus Merciorum ; \" and again in 919, \" subregulus.\" This last title he also gives him in \u00c6lfred's time in 894, but in 886 he is only \"comes.\" However this may be, in another charter of 904 (Cod. Dipl. ii. 148), granted to a subordinate Ealdorman \u00c6thelfrith, the supremacy of Eadward is distinctly recognized ; \" pr\u00e6dictus dux rogavit Eaduuardum regem et \u00c6Selredum quoque et \u00c6tSelfl\u00e6dam qui tune principatum et potestatem gentis Merciorum sub pr\u00e6dicto rege tenuerunt, omnes etiam senatores Merciorum.\""], [623, "THE COMMENDATION OF 924. 575 As \u00c6thelred is \" Myrcna hlaford,\" so \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d always appears in the Chronicles as \" Myrcna hl\u00e6fdige,\" and in Florence as \" Merciorum domina.\" Lady, I need hardly say, was in Wessex the highest female title, being reserved for the King's wife. But in Mercia, as not being affected by the crime and punishment of Eadburh, the title of Queen seems to have gone on. In the Chronicles (888) we read of \u00c6lfred's sister, the widow of Burhred, as \" \u00c6SelswicS cwen.\" \" Hl\u00e6fdige \" therefore may perhaps have been meant as a title less distinctly royal; but in the Annales Cambri\u00e6 (917) we read, \" \u00c6lfled regina obiit.\" On the whole it seems plain that the position of \u00c6thelred, and still more the position of his widow, was something above that of an ordinary Ealdorman. It should be remembered that he was the first Ealdorman of what had not long before been a mighty king dom, and this quasi-royal position was a natural stage in the process of incorporation. NOTE G. pp. 58, 119. The Commendation of 924. My narrative of the relations between England and Scotlaud, and my view of the dependence of the Scottish crown on the English Empire from 924 to 1328, are grounded on what I believe to be the sure witness of ancient authorities, read to a great extent under the guidance of Sir Francis Palgrave. All notion of any legal or permanent dependence such as I assert is cast aside by the late Mr. E. W. Robertson in his book entitled \" Scotland under Early Kings.\" That book is one which, though I hold many of its views to be erroneous, cannot be passed by without notice. It is a work of deep research and ability, and Mr. Robertson has the advantage of an acquaintance with Celtic literature to which I can make no pretensions. And I find with especial pleasure that, on several points where our theories do not clash, Mr. Robertson and myself have come independently to the same conclusions. Still on the points at issue I confess that, after reading Mr. Robert son's arguments, I remain of the same opinion as I was before. He has thrown a certain amount of doubt on a few details which are not absolutely essential, but I think that he has utterly failed to"], [624, "APPENDIX. 576 upset those clear passages of the Chronicles on which the belief which I share with Sir Francis Palgrave mainly rests. Unluckily the scheme of my work does not allow me to grapple in detail with all Mr. Robertson's arguments as to the earliest stages of the question. But I confess that I feel strongly inclined to enter minutely into them in some other shape. The subject is one excellently suited for a monograph. I have myself dealt with some parts of it somewhat more fully in my Historical Essays (First Series, p. 56). But I feel that the question is very far from being exhausted, and I trust that some other champion of the rights of Eadward and \u00c6thelstan may be forthcoming. The point which forms the immediate subject of this Note is the Commendation of Scotland to Eadward in 924, the most impor tant point in the whole dispute. The choosing of Eadward as Father and Lord by the King of Scots and the whole people of the Scots is, both in the thirteenth and in the nineteenth century, the primary fact from which the English controversialist starts. William of Malmesbury, or even Florence of Worcester, may have blundered or exaggerated about Eadgar's triumph at Chester or about any other point of detail, but, as long as the fact of the great Commendation is admitted, the case of the West-Saxon Emperors of Britain stands firm. That Commendation is recorded, as clearly as words can record it, not in a ballad or in a saga, not in the inflated rhetoric of a Latin charter, but in the honest English of the Winchester Chronicle. Than its words no words can be plainer ; \" Aud hine geces pa to f\u00e6der and to hlaforde Scotta cyning and eall Scotta peod, and R\u00e6gnald and Eadulfes suna and ealle pa pe on Norphymbrum, bugeap, \u00e6gper ge Englisce, ge Denisce, ge Norjjmen, ge opre, and eac Str\u00e6cled Weala cyning, and ealle Str\u00e6cled Wealas.\" I add the translation of Florence, who places the event in 921, not however as holding that it adds anything to the authority of the original record ; \" Eo tempore rex Scottorum cum tota gente sua, Reignoldus rex Danorum cum Anglis et Danis Northhymbriam incolentibus, rex etiam Streat cledwalorum cum suis, regem Eadwardum seniorem sibi in patrem et dominum elegerunt, firmumque cum eo f\u0153dus pepigerunt.\" Now if we are not to believe a fact on such evidence as this, there is nothing in those times which we can believe. It is strange that, in the obvious place for treating of the subject, in the text of his"], [625, "THE COMMENDATION OF 924. 577 history at vol. i. p. 59, Mr. Robertson has not a word to say about the matter, but passes over the year 924 as if it were bare of events. But in an Appendix (vol. ii. p. 394) he discusses the matter at some length. To the truth of the famous record which I have quoted at pp. 58, 119 of my own text Mr. Robertson makes several objections. First, he alleges that the Northumbrian Danes did not submit to Eadward. It is almost enough to answer that this passage is evidence that they did. If we are not to accept the distinct statements of the Chronicles, we are altogether at sea in the history of these times. Mr. Robertson's reason for doubting the truth of the statement is that it is inconsistent with certain passages in other English writers \u2014 he might have added in the Chronicles themselves \u2014 which attribute the first annexation of Northumber land to \u00c6thelstan in 926. But there is nothing irreconcileable in the two statements. I gave the explanation in the text of my first edition without having heard of Mr. Robertson's objections ; \" Eadward's immediate kingdom reached to the Humber, and his over-lordship extended over the whole island \" (p. 58). But, from 926 onwards, the object of \u00c6thelstan and his successors was to extend, not their over-lordship but their immediate sovereignty, over the whole of Northumberland. \" \u00c6thelstan cyning feng to NortShymbra rice.\" He became the immediate King of the country, whereas Eadward had been only Father aud Lord to its Kings and people. After 926 Northumbrian Kings were often set up, but, except the lords of Bamburgh, of whom I shall speak in another Note, no Northumbrian prince was admitted by \u00c6thelstan to vassalage. He asserted and maintained an immediate dominion over the country. This system was followed by his successors, except during the momentary recognition of Olaf and B\u00e6gnald by Eadmund in 943. There is therefore no contradiction. Eadward introduced one state of things in Northumberland and \u00c6thelstan introduced another. Secondly, Mr. Robertson objects that the Chronicles represent the Commendation to have been made at Bakewell in the Peakland, and that this is inconsistent \" with the words which Simeon and Florence place in the mouth of Malcolm Ceanmore\" in 1092 (it should be 1093), which \" show that, in the opinion of that age, no Scottish King had ever met an Anglo-Saxon sovereign except upon VOL. I. Pp"], [626, "578 APPENDIX. their mutual [sic] frontiers.\" Now, if there were any real incon sistency between the two statements, the direct statement of the Chronicle under the year 924 is surely much better authority for the events of the year 924 than an inference made by Mr. Robert son from a speech attributed to Malcolm in 1093. If Malcolm's speech contradicts the facts of history, so much the worse for Malcolm and his speech. But there is really no inconsistency at all. The Chronicle in no way implies that the Commendation was made at Bakewell, and Malcolm in no way implies that it was not made at Bakewell. The Chronicler puts the Commendation of the King of Scots and the other princes in the same year as the build ing of the fortress of Bakewell ; he may even imply that Eadward's progress towards the North, of which the fortification of Bakewell was a part, had a share in bringing about the submission of all these Northern Kings. But he does not say that any of them came to Bakewell to make the Commendation. Malcolm says only that the Kings of Scots had been used to \" do their duty \" (rectitu dinem facere) to the Kings of the English only on the confines of their dominions. The assertion may be true or false ; but it is quite another thing from asserting that no King of Scots had ever met an English King anywhere but on the frontier. The first place of meeting need not have been the same as that which was usual 169 years later. There is in short nothing to show whether the Commendation took place at Bakewell or anywhere else. Lastly, Mr. Robertson objects that R\u00e6gnald or Regenwald, who is described as one of the princes who submitted in 924, died in 921. I presume that, along with the Commendation of R\u00e6gnald in 924, Mr. Robertson sets aside his taking of York, which the Chronicles place in 923. This is asking us to give up a good deal out of deference to his Irish guides. But here again there is no necessary inconsistency. Mr. Robertson refers to the Annals of Ulster. Those Annals (Ant. Celt. Norm. p. 66) undoubtedly kill \"Reginald OTvar,\" not in 921 but in 920 ; but the name was a common one, and I see no evidence that the two R\u00e6gnalds need be the tame. The Annals of Ulster themselves show that there was another person of the same name, \" Reginald Mac Beolach,\" living in the same part of the world in 917, and it would be worth inquiring whether any of these R\u00e6gnalds \u2014 the name is spelt in endless ways \u2014 can he the same as the R\u00e6gnald who figures at this"], [627, "THE COMMENDATION OF 924. 579 time in the history of Gaul (see p. 163). I will not rely on the signatures of two charters of 930 by Regenwald or Reinwald (Cod. Dipl. ii. 1 68-1 71), because Mr. Kemble marks them as doubtful. Anyhow I see no proof of error in our Chronicles. There is no real contradiction between the English and Irish authorities ; and if there be, I really do not see why the Englishman must needs go to the wall. But granting that R\u00e6gnald's name was wrongly inserted, such a mistake would not touch the main fact of the Commendation. Such a fact as the Commendation of Scotland and Strathclyde is a thing about which there could be no mistake. It is either an historical truth or a barefaced lie. But in mention ing several minor princes who commended themselves at the same time, a wrong name might easily slip in without any evil intention. Several Northumbrian chiefs commended themselves ; R\u00e6gnald was a famous Northumbrian name ; a scribe might easily put R\u00e6gnald instead of some other name. The blunder would not be so bad as when Thietmar calls \u00c6lfheah Dunstan (see Appendix 00), or as the utter confusion which the Scandinavian writers make of the names and order both of English Kings and of Norman Dukes. I have examined this question in full, because it is the root of the whole matter. Other questions raised by Mr. Robertson I must pass by, or reserve for some other opportunity for discussion. I certainly think that the Commendation of 924 is in no way touched by Mr. Robertson's objections, and I feel sure, from the acuteness which Mr. Robertson displays in other parts of his work, that he would never have satisfied himself with such futile argu ments except under the influence of strong national partiality. Another point, which I have briefly mentioned at pp. 131, 451, is worth notice. The fact that the people, as well as the King, choose Eadward as their lord does not seem to me to imply that he became lord to each particular man. In cases where the relation was much closer than between Scotland and England, the arriere vassal was not the man of the over-lord. Thus John of Joinville, as a vassal of the Count of Champagne, refused to do homage to the King of the French, because he was not his man. When Henry the Second exacted an oath of fealty from the vassals of William the Lion, the claim was a novelty, and it was given up by p p 2"], [628, "580 APPENDIX. Richard the First, a renunciation which has been perverted into a renunciation of all superiority over Scotland. But when we reach the final quarrel between Edward the First and John of Balliol, it turns on a question which looks very like a claim on the part of the King of England to jurisdiction in internal Scottish affairs. That is to say, Edward the First, as a feudal superior, received appeals from the courts of the King of Scots, exactly as the King of the French, Edward's own feudal superior for the duchy of Aquitaine, received appeals from Edward's courts in that duchy. We can hardly suppose that any such right was contemplated in the original Commendation ; it is a notion essenti ally belonging to a later time. But it was no arbitrary invention of Edward ; he did but receive the appeals which Scottish suitors brought before him of their own accord. The truth is that, when the commendatory relation had, in the ideas of both sides, changed into a strictly feudal one, the right of appeal would seem to follow as a matter of course, and neither side would stop to ask whether such a right was really implied in the ancient Commendation. NOTE H. pp. 63, 125. The Grant of Cumberland Nothing can be plainer than the entry on this head in the Chronicles (945), \" Her Eadmund cyning ofer hergode eal Cumbra land, and hit let eal to Malculme Scotta cyninge on p\u00e6t gerad p\u00e6t he w\u00e6re his midwyrhta \u00e6gper ge on s\u00e6 ge on lande.\" Florence simply translates, except that a slight tinge of the later feudalism is perhaps thrown in when he expresses the word \"midwyrhta\" by \"fidelis.\" Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 746 C), though bringing in some rather vague matter, is more literal in his version on this point; \"Sequenti vero anno totam Cumberland, quia gentem provinci\u00e6 illius perfidam et legibus insolitam ad plenum domare nequibat, pr\u00e6davit et contrivit et commendavit earn Malculmo regi Scoti\u00e6 hoc pacto, quod in auxilio sibi foret terra et mari.\" William of Malmesbury (ii. 141) merely says, \"Provincia qu\u00e6 vocatur Cumberland regi Scottorum Mal colmo, sub fidelitate jurisjurandi commendata.\" Roger of Wend-"], [629, "THE GRANT OF CUMBERLAND. 581 over (ii. 398) adds the two important details, which he could hardly have invented, that Eadmund was helped in his expedition by Llywelyn of Dj-fed, and that the sons of Dummail or Donald were blinded ; \" Eodem anno rex Eadmundus, adjutorio Leolini regis Demeti\u00e6 fretus, Cumbriam totam cunctis opibus spoliavit, ac duobus filiis Dummail, ejusdem provinci\u00e6 regis, oculorum luce privatis, regnum illud Malcolmo, Scotorum regi, de se tenendum concessit, ut aquilonales Angli\u00e6 partes terra inarique ab hostium adventantium incursione tueretur.\" The Scottish writers, as I have said in the text, in no way deny the fact of the grant ; they are indeed rather inclined, for obvious reasons, to make too much rather than too little of it. Fordun (iv. 24) is more explicit than any of the English writers, and uses the most distinctly feudal language ; \" Provinciam, qu\u00e6 vocatur Cumbreland, regi Scotorum Malcolmo rex sub fidelitate juris jurandi commendavit, h\u00e6c ille. Postmodum vero statim inter eos concordatum est, et amborum consilio decretum, ut in futurum, pro bono continuand\u00e6 pads utriusque regni, Malcolmi regis proximus h\u00e6res Indulfus, c\u00e6terorumque regum Scotorum h\u00e6redes qui pro tempore fuerint, Edmuudo regi suisque successoribus Anglis regibus homagium pro Cumbria facerent, ac fidelitatis sacramen tum.\" He goes on to say, in language which seems to come from the same source as the words of Henry of Huntingdon, that neither King was ever to take the Cumbrians, \" barbaram aquilonis et perfidam genteru,\" into his direct favour or homage, a promise which was afterwards broken on both sides. The fact of the grant is also admitted in the book called \"Extracta ex Cronicis Scocie,\" pp. 49, 50, though the compiler vigorously asserts a former Scottish possession which was lost through the Scottish defeat at Brunauburh. Of King Gregory (875-892) we read (p. 46), \" Hie etiam strenue totam subjugavit Hiberniam et pene totam Angliam.\" Of Constantine (p. 47), \"Hie rex xl annis regnavit, et quamvis contra eum bellabant reges Anglorum, Eadwmws [sic] et fifius suus nothus Adelstanus suc cessive regnantes, et contra Scotos cum Danis pactum et pacem inierunt, qui post iv annos rumpitur, et Angli a Scotis veniam precantes iterum Scotos sibi reconciliarunt. Quo toto tempore rex Constantinus Cumbriam et ceteras terras in Anglia posse dit, et regni sui anno xvi dedit Eugenio filio Dovenaldi sperato"], [630, "APPENDIX. 582 successori dimidium regni Cumbri hereditarie possidendum.\" It is curious to see the frame of mind in which he approaches the mention of Brunanburh ; \" Infaustus ille dies Scotis, nam qu\u00e6que dominia temporibus Gregorii et hactenus conquesta, necnon liv annis possessa, quidam scribunt Constantinum regem hoc bello perdidisse.\" So we find it also in Hector Boece (218 b), by whose time the story had got further confused, and the grant, or rather treaty, is now attributed to \u00c6thelstan instead of Eadmund ; \" Secundum legationem omnibus consentientibus f\u0153dus inter Anglos Scotosque veteribus conditionibus est ictum, hac unica adjecta, ut Anglis Northumbria, Danico turn sanguine pene referto, cederent ; Cum bria ac Vestmaria Scotis ; ea lege, ut Scotorum princeps (ita eum qui secundum regem vita functum summum obiturus est magis tratum, uti est significatum antea, vocant nostrates) in verba Anglorum regis ea pro regione juraret.\" This passage is worth notice, as showing that the modern use of the word Prince, as equivalent to \u00c6theling, was coming into use in Boece's time, but that it still needed explanation. As to the fact and the nature of the grant to Malcolm there can, I think, be no doubt. It was probably the earliest instance in Britain of a fief in the strictest sense, as opposed to a case of commendation. But I wish to keep myself as clear as possible from all mazes as to the ever fluctuating boundaries of Strathclyde or Cumberland. On the whole matter, I would refer to Palgrave, English Commonwealth, i. 440 et seqq. NOTE I. p. 65. The Cession of Lothian. The question with regard to Lothian is briefly this. Was the cession of that part of Northumberland to the Scottish crown a grant from Eadgar to his faithful vassal Kenneth 1 Or was the district wrung by Malcolm from the fears of Eadwulf Cutel, or won by force of arms after the battle of Carham in 1018 ? Mr. Robertson (Scotland under Early Kings, i. 96 ; ii. 390 et seqq., 426 et seqq.), consistently with his theory, strongly adopts"], [631, "THE CESSION OF LOTHIAN. 583 the latter view, and maintains the former to be a mere \" fabrica tion.\" To me the question seems a very difficult one, about which it will be well to go minutely through all the authorities. The Chronicles, Florence, William of Malmesbury, Simeon of Durham in his main history, are all silent as to any transfer of Lothian from English to Scottish dominion. And yet nothing is more certain than that Lothian was at one time English and that at a later time it became Scottish. The only question is as to the date of the change. The first beginnings of the Scottish occupa tion of Lothian are certainly older than either of the dates given above. Indulf, who reigned from 954 to 962, occupied Edinburgh, Eadwinesburh, the frontier fortress of the great Northumbrian Bretwalda, which ever after remained in the power of the Scots. This does not seem to have been a conquest made in war. The English forsook the post. \" In hujus tempore,\" says the Pictish Chronicler (Ant. Celt. Norm. p. 142), \" oppidum Eden vacuatum est, ac relictum est Scottis usque in hodiernum diem.\" Possibly Edinburgh was a grant made by Eadred on his final acquisition of Northumberland in 954. Eadred's relations with Scotland were friendly. The Scots made full submission to him on his election in 946 ; they acted as his allies in his wars with the rebellious Northumbrians; Scots and English, \"the men of Alba and the Saxons,\" were, according to the Four Masters (vol. ii. p. 668), defeated by the \"foreigners\" \u2014 doubtless the Danes \u2014 in 951. If Eadred rewarded his Scottish ally with the grant of Edinburgh, the step would be very like the grant of Cumberland to Malcolm in 945. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the relin quishment of Edinburgh by the English may have been less wholly an act of free will than the grant of Cumberland ; it may have been found difficult or useless to maintain so distant a fortress during the troubles of the reign of Eadwig. But on any showing, the event of Indulfs reign was simply a relinquishment of the single fortress of Edinburgh, though such a relinquishment may well have been felt, especially on the Scottish side, to be merely a step towards the transfer of the whole province. For the date of the great cession our authorities are John of Wallingford (p. 544) and Roger of Wendover (i. 416), who give the earlier date, and Simeon of Durham in his Tract on the Northumbrian Earls (X Scripts. 81), who gives the later."], [632, "584 APPENDIX. According to John of Wallingford, Eadgar (see p. 266 and Appendix KK), in a meeting of the Northumbrian Witan at York (\"barones Northumbrenses in concilium convocans apud Ebora cum\"), divided the ancient kingdom into two earldoms, giving Deira to Oslac and Bernicia (which John confusedly calls Deira) to Eadwulf \" Evelchild.\" The name of Eadwulf is seemingly due to some confusion with Oswulf, whom John, fancies to be dead. But Lothian, the northern part of Bernicia, lying exposed to the incur sions of the Scots, was little valued by the English Kings. The King of Scots moreover asserted a claim to it by hereditary right. Kenneth accordingly went to London, accompanied by the two Northumbrian Earls and by \u00c6lfsige Bishop of Lindisfarne, to seek a conference with Eadgar. Eadgar received him friendly, and Kenneth opened his case, praying for Lothian as an ancient possession of the Scottish Kings. Eadgar referred the matter to his Witan (\" caussam curi\u00e6 su\u00e6 intimavit \"), by whose consent the province was granted in fief \u2014 I cannot avoid the terms of a later jurisprudence \u2014 to Kenneth, who did homage for it. Kenneth also promised that the ancient laws and customs of the country should be preserved and the English language retained, an engagement which was strictly carried out (\" sub cautione multa promittens quod populo partis illius antiquas consuetudines non negaret, et sub nomine et lingua Anglicana permanerent. Quod usque hodie firmum manet \"). Thus the old dispute about Lothian was settled, though new ones often arose (\" sicque determinata est vetus querela de Louthion, et adhuc nova s\u00e6pe intentatur \"). Roger of Wendover is briefer. He tells how Earl Eadwulf \u2014 he does not mention Oslac \u2014 and Bishop \u00c6lfsige took the Scottish King to the court of Eadgar; how the King of the English gave Kenneth many magnificent presents, and granted to him the whole land of Lothian. The tenure was that, each year, on the great feasts when the King wore his crown (see the Peterborough Chronicle under the year 1087), the King of Scots should come to his court with the other princes of his realm. Eadgar also assigned to his royal vassal and his successors several houses at different points of the road, at which they could be entertained on their way to the English court, Which mansions the Kings of Scots retained down to the time of Henry the Second."], [633, "THE CESSION OF LOTHIAN. 585 Simeon places the cession after the death of Uhtred in 1016 (see p. 448) ; \" Quo [Ucthredo] occiso, frater ipsius Eadulf cognomento Cudel, ignavus valde et timidus, et successit in comitatum. Timens autem ne Scotti mortem suorum quos frater ejus, ut supradictum est [see p. 329], occiderat, in se vindicarent, totum Lodoneium ob satisfac tionem et firmam concordiam eis donavit. Hoc modo Lodoneium adjectum est regno Scottorum.\" Now, looking at our authorities in the abstract, there is no doubt as to the infinite superiority of Simeon, our very best au thority for Northumbrian affairs, over two late and often inaccurate writers like John of Wallingford and Roger of Wendover. If there is an irreconcileable contradiction between the two stories, Simeon's story is to be preferred without hesitation. I hold that Simeon's statement distinctly proves that some cession of Lothian was made by Eadwulf, and, if so, we can hardly be wrong in setting down that cession as a result of the battle of Carham. The question is whether this can be admitted, aud at the same time some kernel of truth be recognized in the story told by John and Roger. Let us first see what the witness of those writers is worth in itself. I need hardly say that secondary writers of this sort, even the best of them, must be subjected to much severer tests than any that we apply to the Chronicles, to Florence, or even to William of Malmesbury. We accept nothing, strictly speaking, on their authority. We weigh their statements and judge what they are worth, both according to the laws of internal evidence aud according to the way in which they may incidentally fall in with or inci dentally contradict the statements of better writers. We put very little faith in their details, which are more likely than not to be romantic additions. Still in all cases we acknowledge the likelihood that there is some kernel of truth round which the romantic details have grown. John of Wallingford is undoubtedly a writer whom it is not safe to trust, unless his statements have some strong confirmation, internal or external. Of his way of dealing with matters, I have given some specimens in the course of this volume (see Note GG). Still he is not to be cast aside as wholly worth less. A few pages before the passage with which we are concerned (pp. 535, 540), he shows a good deal of critical acumen in pointing"], [634, "586 APPENDIX. out the chronological impossibility of the tale which makes Rolf an ally of the great \u00c6thelstan (see above, p. 165). Roger of Wendover is, on the whole, a more trustworthy writer than John, and when he comes nearer to his own time, he becomes a very valuable authority ; but for times so far removed from their own days, John and Roger must be set down as writers belonging essentially to the same class. Now in comparing their two statements as to the cession of Lothian by Eadgar, we are at once struck by the fact that the two accounts seem quite independent of each other. There is no sign that either narrative is borrowed from the other, no sign that the two are borrowed from some common source. The two stories do not directly contradict one another ; but they have nothing in common, except the bare facts that Kenneth received the province from Eadgar, and that Earl Eadwulf and Bishop \u00c6lfsige had a hand in the business. They are two independent witnesses, pointing, as it seems to me, to two independent sources of tradition or lost record. And of the two, the narrative of John of Wallingford certainly has the clearer inherent signs of trust worthiness. If there is any ground to suspect fabrication with a motive \u2014 not necessarily in the historian himself, but in those whom he followed \u2014 it certainly appears in the narrative of Roger rather than in that of John. Roger gives no account of the cir cumstances of the grant, he assigns no intelligible political motive for it, he describes no intelligible tenure by which the fief was to be held; he dwells mainly on the magnificence of the presents made by Eadgar to Kenneth, and on points bearing on questions which, when he wrote, were matters of recent controversy and negotiation. The points brought out into the greatest prominence are the duty of the King of Scots to attend at the English court, and the signs at once of English munificence and of Scottish submission displayed in the preparations made for the due reception of the royal vassal. These were points of no small interest in the times when Roger was young, and which were not forgotten when he wrote. There is nothing of this kind in the narrative of John of Wallingford. He has undoubtedly made a false step on ground on which it is very easy to make a false step, namely in the succession of the Northumbrian Earls. Even the accurate Simeon, writing so much nearer to the place and to the time, has himself, in one case at least, done the like (see Note LLL). John's Eadwulf Evelchild"], [635, "THE CESSION OF LOTHIAN. 587 ought to be Oswulf, just as Simeon's Uhtred, in the account of the battle of Carbarn, ought to be Eadwulf. But John's main story fits in very well with the facts of the case. Mr. Robertson (ii. 391) objects that there was no \" old quarrel about Lothian.\" But the facts show that there was. Surely Lothian was an old Pictish possession which had been conquered by the Angles, and which was sometimes partially won back by its old owners. The wars of \u00c6thelfrith (B\u00e6da, i. 34) and of Ecgfrith (iv. 26) surely make up a very old \" querela de Louthion,\" but one not too old for Celtic memories to bear in mind. The acquisition of Edinburgh, however made, shows that the Scottish Kings in the tenth century were looking steadily in the direction of Lothian. Kenneth him self, friendly as he now was to Eadgar, had made at least one foray into the country. The Pictish Chronicle (Ant. Celt. Norm. 143) says, \"Primo anno perrexit Cinadius et pr\u00e6davit Saxoniam [Lothian] et traduxit filium regis Saxonum\" (see p. 65). The captivity of an English \u00c6theling is a grotesque exag geration ; but we may accept the fact that Kenneth had some border skirmishes with the local Earl, who in 971, the first year of Kenneth, would be Oswulf. All this shows that the acquisition of Lothian was at this time a favourite object of Scottish ambition. And now that Eadgar and Kenneth were on friendly terms, a grant of the country, like the undoubted grant of Cumberland, like the probable grant of Edinburgh, might be an act of thoroughly good policy on the part of England. A distant province, which it was hard to keep as an integral part of the kingdom, might be pru dently granted as a fief to the prince by whom it was claimed, and to whose incursions it lay open. That the conditions spoken of by John of Wallingford, the retention of the laws and language of Lothian, were strictly kept, is proved by the whole later history. The laws and language of Lothian became the laws and language of the historic Scotland. The cession recorded by John of Wallingford seems therefore to be in itself highly probable. But is it inconsistent with the later, and undoubtedly better authenticated, cession recorded by Simeon of Durham 1 It does not seem to me to be so ; neither did it to Sir Francis Palgrave (Engl. Comm. i. 474, 477) or to Dr. Lap penberg (ii. 141, 207, p. 473 of the original). It may be that the word Lothian, a somewhat vague name, has a slightly different"], [636, "APPENDIX. 588 meaning in the two passages ; it may be that a cession was made to Kenneth by Eadgar, and a further cession by Eadwulf Cutel to Malcolm. It is less easy to believe, with Sir Francis Palgrave, that Eadwulf's cession was a cession of the rights of the local Earl, reserved, or not formally surrendered, at the time of the \"earlier grant by the King. The simplest explanation is to suppose that Lothian was recovered by the English after the great victory of Uhtred in 1006, that it was occupied again by the Scots after their victory at Carham, and that then the cowardly Eadwulf gave up all claim to it. Cnut however, in 1031, if not before (see p. 450 and Note LLL), set matters straight. In that year at least, \"Scotta cyng him to beah,\" \"and wear?? his mann\" \u2014 Malcolm then became the liegeman of the King of all England for Scotland and Lothian and all that he had. This I believe to be the most probable explanation of this difficult question. The silence of the Chronicles proves nothing either way; it has to be accounted for equally on either view of the story. No transfer of Lothian at any time is mentioned in the Chronicles, yet we know that a transfer did take place at some time. The positive argument from the statement of the Chronicles is always the strongest that can be found ; the negative argument from their silence is, under varying circumstances, of every degree of strength and weakness. Here it seems easily accounted for. The Chroniclers are at all times somewhat capri cious in their mention or neglect of Scottish affairs. They mention neither the vidory of Durham nor the defeat of Carham. And the reigns of Eadgar and Cnut, the periods with which we are imme diately concerned, are periods in which the Chronicles are decidedly meagre, as compared with their minute narratives of the reigns of \u00c6thelred aud of Eadward the Confessor. How thoroughly English Lothian was held to be long after either date assigned to the cession appears from the words of the Chronicler, 1091; \" Melcolm ... for mid his fyrde ut of Scotlande into LotSene on Englaland.\" Florence translates \" Northymbriam invasit.\" One would like to know whether the \"xii. villae quas in Anglia sub patre illius [Willelmi Rufi se.] habuerat [Malcolmus] \" (Flor. Wig. 109 1 ) were in Lothian or where."], [637, "EALDORMEN AND KINGS. 589 NOTE K. pp. 75, 117. Ealdormen and Kings. The description of the oldest Teutonic constitution given by C\u00e6sar (Bell. Gall. vi. 23) tells us, \"In pace nullus est communis magistratus ; sed principes regionum atque pagorum inter suos jus dicunt.\" This seems to imply a government by Ealdormen as distinguished from one by Kings. Pagus is the Gau or Shire. So Dio (lxxi. n), describing the German embassies to Marcus, says, 0! pev Kara yevt], 01 hi Kal Kara edvn in-pco-lievo-avro. But Tacitus (Germ. 25, 44) seems to distinguish the tribes \"qu\u00e6 regnantur\" from others. So Arminius was suspected of aiming at royalty (Ann. ii. 88) ; \" Regnum adfectans, libertatem popularium adver sam habuit.\" So B\u00e6da (v. 10) describes the Old-Saxons at the end of the seventh century. They had no King, but Satraps, that is doubtless Ealdormen ; in war-time one Satrap was chosen as a common commander, but his superiority ended with the conclusion of peace. \" Non enim habent regem iidem Antiqui Saxones, sed satrapas plurimos su\u00e6 genti pr\u00e6positos, qui ingruente belli articulo mittunt \u00e6qualiter sortes, et quemcumque sors ostenderit, hunc tempore belli ducem omnes sequuntur, huic obtemperant ; peracto autem bello, rursum \u00e6qualis potenti\u00e6 omnes fiunt satrap\u00e6.\" I have collected some other analogous cases in the Growth of the English Constitution, 172-3 (3rd ed.), and Comparative Politics, 414. In Zosimos (iv. 34) Athanaric is apx^v and Frithgar We may compare the description of the Alemanni at the battle of Strassburg in Ammianus, xvi. 12. Chnodomarius, the Bretwalda, so to speak, comes first, then some other chiefs by name ; \" Hos sequebantur potestate proximi reges numero quinque, regalesque decem et optimatum series magna.\" Are the regales \u00c6thelings, or are they subreguli, under -cyningas, ealdormen 1 With regard to the Kentishmen and the West-Saxons, the case seems perfectly clear. We read of the Jutes in the Chronicles, 449, \" Heora heretogan w\u00e6ron twegen gebroSra, Hengest and Horsa.\" Here heretogan translates the duces of B\u00e6da, i. 15. And of the West-Saxons in 495, \" Her comen twegen ealdormen on Brytene Cerdic and Cynric his sunu.\" Afterwards in 519 we find nearly the same words applied to them as to Ida, \" Her Cerdic and"], [638, "APPENDIX. 590 Cynric Westseaxena rice onfengon.\" The word rice I take to mark the change from ealdormanship to kingship. Between the two dates, in 514, is placed the reinforcement under Stuf and Wihtgar. The temporary change from Kings back again to Eal dormen is distinctly asserted by B\u00e6da, iv. 12 ; \" Quumque mortuus esset Coinvalch . . . acceperunt subreguli regnum gentis, et divisum inter se tenuerunt annis circiter decem . . . Devictis atque amotis subregulis, C\u00e6dualla suscepit imperium.\" The Chronicles however give an uninterrupted succession of Kings during this time. In 672 Cenwealh dies; his widow Sexburh succeeds \u2014 a most rare case of a female reign. Then follow \u00c6scwine in 674, Centwine in 676, Ceadwalla in 685. The change from Ealdormen to Kings in Mercia and East-Anglia is also plainly marked in the remarkable passage of Henry of Huntingdon which I quoted in page 26. And we may with all likelihood, as I there said, assert much the same of Northumberland. But between the case of Wessex and the case of Mercia or Northumberland there would be this difference. In Mercia, and probably in Northumberland, a number of small but quite independent kingdoms or ealdormanships were brought in under the power of a single conqueror, while in Wessex, though there were several Kings at once, a certain national unity was never lost. The change therefore from Kings back again to Ealdormen was possible in Wessex, where it was merely a change in the form of government ; in Mercia it would have been the utter dissolu tion of every tie between the different parts of the country. The history of the Lombards affords in this respect a singular parallel to the history of the West-Saxons. According to Paul Warnefrid (Gest. Langob. i. 14, ap. Muratori, i. 413), they were at first governed by Dukes, but afterwards they chose a King ; \" Nolentes jam ultra Langobardi esse sub ducibus, regem sibi ad ceterarum instar gentium statuerunt.\" There is no reason to doubt the fact, though it is placed in a mythical age, and though Paul the Deacon is evidently thinking of Saul and the Hebrews. Indeed the change from Judges and \" Dukes\" to Kings among the Hebrews and Edomites is only another instance of the same law. At a later time, after their settlement in Italy, the Lombards fell back again from Kings to Dukes or Ealdormen. Paul Warn. ii. 32; \"Post cujus [Cleph] mortem, Langobardi per annos decem regem non habentes sub ducibus fuerunt. Unusquisque"], [639, "EALDORMEN AND KINGS. 591 enim ducum [there were thirty of them] suam civitatem obtinebat.\" (See Allen, Royal Prerogative, 1 65.) In comparing these Lombard revolutions with those of the West-Saxons and Old-Saxons, it should not be forgotten that a considerable body of Saxons is said (Paul Warn. ii. 6) to have taken a part in the Lombard invasion of Italy. But parallels may be found in very distant times and places. Compare the twelve Kings of Egypt in the second Book of Herodotus. That Heretoga and Ealdorman express the same office in different aspects, there can, I think, be no doubt. See Kemble, Saxons in England, ii. 126. I do not however understand Mr. Kemble's meaning when he says ; \" The word Heretoga is nowhere found in the Saxon Chronicle, and, to the best of my remembrance, but once in the Charters.\" Besides the passage above quoted, it is found in the Chronicles under the years 794 (of Danish pirates), 993 (of English commanders), 1003 (in a proverb), 1121 (of a Duke of Lotharingia). I have not looked through all the Charters for the purpose, but it is used in three successive grants of Bishop Oswald (Cod. Dipl. iii. 259, 260, 262) to express an Ealdorman of the Mercians. We have just seen Heretoga used in English to translate the High-Dutch Herzog ; but the Dukes and Counts of Gaul commonly appear in the Chronicles as Eorlas. Eorl however, as the later equivalent of Ealdorman, is also equivalent to Heretoga. \u00c6lfred uses Heretoga to translate the Latin Consul, just as, in return, Gaulish Counts and English Ealdormen are constantly spoken of as Consules. On the use of Ealdor, Ealdorman, Yldestan pegnas, to express simply rank and office without any reference to actual age, and for analogous uses in other languages, see Kemble, ii. 128; Heywood's Ranks of the People, 53; Schmid's Glossary under Eald, Ealdorman, &c; Comparative Politics, 366. We have Ealdorapostol, Ealdorbiscop, and even, if I mistake not, Ealdordeofol. Kemble compares the use of Senatus, yipav, npeo-Birepos, and the feudal use of Senior, Seigneur. np<rV/3ur in the sense of Ambassador may be added to the list, and the Latin Patres, Patricius, express the same general idea. In the same spirit the Ealdorman's deputy is called his Younger; see \u00c6lfred's Laws, 38, \u00a7 2 (Schmid, 92);"], [640, "592 APPENDIX. \" gif pises hw\u00e6t beforan cyninges ealdormonnes gingran gelimpe, ocjoe cyninges preoste,\" etc. So Lewis the Pious (Waitz, iv. 262, 368) speaks to his officials of \" vos et juniores vestri, juniores et ministeriales vestri.\" Hlaford, as equivalent, or perhaps something more than equi valent, to Ealdorman, seems peculiar to \u00c6thelred of Mercia (see above, p. 382), though of course the word may be applied to an Ealdorman, as it is to Brihtnoth in the Song of Maldon, with reference to those persons to whom he was personally hlaford. Eorl, I need hardly say, supplanted Ealdorman in later times. The older English meaning of the word Eorl has been already explained. The later special sense in which it is equivalent to Ealdorman came in with the Danes, whose leaders had always been called Jarls. The governors of Northumberland, after the incorporation under Eadred, certainly bore the Danish title. Urm, Andcol, Uhtred (the ancestor of a long line of Northumberland Earls), Grim, and Scule, all seemingly Northumbrian chiefs, sign a charter of Eadred in 949 (Cod. Dipl. ii. 292) with the title of Eorl. The same title is applied to Oslac both in the Chronicles under 975 (\"Oslac se m\u00e6ra eorl\"), and in the laws of Eadgar (Thorpe, i. 278), where the Earl Oslac seems to be pointedly distinguished from the Ealdormen \u00c6lfhere of Mercia and \u00c6thel wine of East-Anglia. So in the Chronicles for 992 \"\u00c6lfric ealdorman\" (the well-known \u00c6lfric, of whom more in Note CC) is no less pointedly distinguished from \" pored eorl.\" But when the word Eorl is found in this sense in the Chronicles at an earlier date, it is always a sign of later insertion. (See Earle, p. 38.) Whether the title was in use throughout the Denalagu is less clear. Brihtnoth is called Eorl in the poem of Maldon ; but this may be a poetical use. He is also called Ealdor in the wide sense in the poem itself, as well as Ealdorman in various docu ments and in the Chronicles. On the other hand the Chronicles con stantly speak of Ealdormen, even in Danish districts like Lindesey; but this may be an accommodation to Southern language, and they do so even when speaking of Northumberland. In the purely Saxon districts there can be no doubt that the ancient title of Ealdorman went on uninterruptedly, till, under Cnut, Eorl gra dually supplanted it everywhere. Se.e p. 407. That birth was of less importance in the case of an Ealdorman"], [641, "ORIGIN OF THE WORD KINO. 593 than in the case of a King appears from the well-known words of Tacitus (Germ. 7), \"Reges ex nobilitate, Duces ex virtute sumunt.\" This is most curiously illustrated in the Song of Bru nanburh, where seven earls of the Danes are killed and five young kings (\"Fife lagon On ?S\u00e6m campstede Ciningas geonge\"). The King ruling \"ex nobilitate\" might be young ; the Earl ruling \"ex virtute\" was likely to be old. On this whole subject of the origin and growth of kingship see the Authorities and Illustrations to Allen on the Royal Prerogative. NOTE L. p. 78. Origin of the Word King. It is enough for my purpose that the word Cyning is closely connected with the word Gyn. (See Allen, Royal Prerogative, 176; Kemble, i. 153.) That the two words are of the same origin, as is shown by a whole crowd of cognates, cynebarn, cynecyn, cynedom, cynehelm, cynehlaford (used in the Chronicles, a. 1014, as equivalent to gecynde hlaford), cynelice, cynerice, cynestol. (I copy from Mr. Earle's Glossarial Index.) In all these words cyn has the meaning of royal. What little I venture to say on the remote Aryan affinities of the word I have said in Comparative Politics, 450, Growth of the English Constitution, 172. The modern High-Dutch Kbnig is an odd corruption ; but the elder form is Chuninc. The word has never had an English feminine ; Queen is simply civen, woman, wife, the same as the Greek yvi/17, but in Wessex, from the days of Beorhtric to those of William, Gwen most rarely occurs (Chron. 855 and Chron. Petrib. 1043, though in both these passages it may simply mean wife); Hl\u00e6fdige (see above, p. 575) is the regular title. Sir Francis Palgrave's attempt (ii. cccxli.) to derive the word from a Celtic root Gen (head), to say nothing of other objections, could not account for the use of the word among the Teutonic nations on the Continent. Still more ludicrous is the notion of the King being the canning or cunning man, an idea which could have occurred only to a mind on which all Teutonic philology was thrown away. It is however as old as Sir Thomas Smith, who, VOL. I. Q q"], [642, "APPENDIX. 594 in the Commonwealth of England (pp. 9, 10) says, \" That which we eal in one sillable king in English, the old Englishmen, and the Saxons, from whom our tongue is derived, to this day call in two sillables, cyning, which whether it commeth of cen or ken, which betokeneth to know and understand, or can, which be tokeneth to be able, or to have power, I cannot tel.\" The connexion of Cyning with Cyn is closely analogous to the connexion of the word peoden (the Gothic piudans) with peod (see Kemble, i. 152) and that of Drihten with Driht. In all these cases the ruler takes his name from those whom he rules. The origin of the word is curiously illustrated in Cardinal Pole's exposition of the nature of kingship, quoted in Froude's History of England, iii. 34. '\"What is a king?' he asks. ' A king exists for the sake of his people ; he is an outcome from Nature in labour [partus natur\u00e6 laborantis] ; an institu tion for the defence of material and temporal interests . . . . In human society are three grades \u2014 the people \u2014 the priesthood, the bead and husband of the people \u2014 the king, who is the child [populus enim regem procreat], the creature, and minister of the other two.'\" One can hardly suspect Pole of any Teutonic scholarship, but if he had not the true derivation of the word king before his eyes, the coincidence is remarkable. Not very unlike is the speech of Philip Pot, Great Seneschal of Burgundy in the States General of Tours in 1484. \"La royaute est une dignite et non un heritage. Dans l'origine, le peuple souverain crea des rois pour son utilite.\" De Cherrier, Histoire de Charles VIII. i. 76. NOTE M. p. 78. King of England or King of the English ] It is most curious to see how very modern are those terri torial titles which, for some centuries past, European Kings have thought good to assume. In Greek we always find a national sovereign described by the national style ; it is always AaKeSaipoviiav, MaKeSovav, even Uepcrav and MijSuk, fiao-iXevs. In Livy (xxxi. 14, xxxv. 13) we no doubt read of \" Antiochus rex Syri\u00e6\""], [643, "KING OF ENGLAND OR KING OF THE ENGLISH ? 595 and \" Ptolem\u00e6us rex \u00c6gypti.\" But this is of course, because the kingship of the Ptolemies and Seleucid\u00e6 was so utterly unnational that any but a territorial description would have been absurd. In fact it is a description and not a title. As a description of this kind, the words \"Rex Franci\u00e6\" actually occur as early as the tenth century. (Flodoard, A. 924.) But this is not a formal title; it is merely the annalist's Vague way of describing or pointing at a prince who had as yet no formal title. If one Rudolf is \" Rex Franci\u00e6,\" in the very same year another Rudolf is \" Cisalpin\u00e6 rex Galli\u00e6,\" which certainly never was the formal title of any man. The truth is that, throughout the ninth and tenth centuries, the various Frankish Kings had no formal title beyond the vague \" Rex Francorum,\" common to all of them. The Chroniclers had therefore to describe each King as they might, just as the sons of Charles the Great are indifferently called \"Rex super Aquitaniam,\" or \"Italiam,\" Ann. Laur. 781 (Pertz, i. 32); \"Rex in Aquitania,\" Ann. Egin. 781, and \"Aquitani\u00e6 Rex\" (ib. 813). But when the French Kings adopted a formal title, Rex Francorum Christianissimus was the style down to the end of the line of Valois. Franci\u00e6 et Navarr\u00e6 Rex came in with Henry of Bourbon. When the ancient style was revived in 1791, and again in 1830, many people seem to have thought it a strange innovation. In both Empires, down to the last days of each, the style is always \" Romanorum Imperator,\" 'Papalav Bao-ikeis. It is only late in the thirteenth century, and when a prince has to be described by his dominions, that we find such a title as the Trapezuntine Style mo-ros BacriXevs Kal avroKpaTiop 'AvaroXrjs, iBnpaiv, Kal nepaTiias. (Finlay, Medi\u00e6val Greece and Trebizond, 370.) In earlier days Charles the Great was \" Patricius Romanorum.\" In England it would seem that Cnut, and Cnut alone before the Norman Conquest, did call himself \" King of England.\" In the Preface to his Laws (Thorpe, i. 358; Schmid, 250) he is called \" Cnut cyningc, ealles Englalandes cyningc, and Dena cyningc and NortSrigena cyningc.\" In the letter from Rome in Florence (1031) he calls himself \"Rex totius Angli\u00e6 et Denemarci\u00e6 et Norreganorum et partis Suanorum.\" In a doubtful charter (Cod. Dipl. iv, 50) he is \"Rex totius Angli\u00e6 regni atque Danorum;\" \"Cing ealles Englelandes and ealre Dene.\" In two most Qqa"], [644, "APPENDIX. 596 doubtful charters (Cod. Dipl. iv. 25, 41) he is \"Kining of \u00c6ngle lande,\" and \"Rex totius Angli\u00e6 et Danmarchi\u00e6 et Norwagi\u00e6 et magn\u00e6 partis Swavorum.\" In other charters he is either \"Rex Anglorum\" (as Florence calls him when speaking in his own person) or else he assumes the Imperial style. It has been suggested that Cnut took up his territorial style as being a conqueror of the land, not a native monarch of the people. But the above instances show that, though he fluctuates between the two forms, he makes no consistent distinction between his hereditary and his acquired kingdoms. Moreover Cnut, like William, was formally elected King, and he was even less likely than William to assume any title which would be offensive to his English subjects. This makes one inclined to look a little further. In the most authentic documents, Anglia, Englaland, does not occur without a qualification; the words are \"totius Angli\u00e6,\" \"ealles Englalandes.\" Is this description so distinctly and un mistakeably territorial as the later forms, \"Rex Angli\u00e6,\" \"King of England\"? The totius, the ealles, strikes me as making a difference. It may show that what is meant is, not \" King of England\" in the later sense, but \" King over the whole land of the English,\" as distinguished from Cnut's earlier and narrower dominion while the kingdom was divided between him and Eadmund. But anyhow Cnut stands alone before the Norman Conquest in the use of this style. After the Conquest \" Rex Angli\u00e6\" begins to creep in, but at first very rarely. William himself is all but invariably \" Rex Anglorum.\" Richard is the first King who is systematically \" Rex Angli\u00e6\" in his charters, and even he is \"Rex Anglorum\" on his seal. And during his reign his mother stuck to the old style \" Regina Anglorum.\" The final innovation of \"Rex Angli\u00e6\" on the seal is due to King John. See Allen, p. 51. In everything, in short, belonging to our old days it is the people who stand forth and not the mere land. In fact, except in the case of old geographical names like Gaul and Britain, the land can hardly be said to have a being or a name apart from the people. The land is simply called by the name of the people, like Lokroi and Leontinoi in Greek geography, like Franken and Hessen in Germany. So in our Chronicles, in the year 774, we read \" gefuhton Myrce and Cantwara,\" where Myrce is clearly"], [645, "COMMENDATION. 597 the people ; but in 796 we read \" hine l\u00e6ddon on Myrce,\" where we must take Myrce for the country. On the use of the name Englaland I shall speak in Note T. On this modern notion of \" territorial sovereignty,\" see Maine, Ancient Law, 103. He remarks that \"territorial titles were not unknown, but they seem at first to have come into use only as a convenient mode of describing the ruler of a portion ; the king of a whole tribe was king of his people, not of his people's lands.\" This is, I suppose, the \"rex super Aquitaniam,\" and the like. NOTE N. pp. 91, 122. Commendation. On the subject of Commendation a good deal will be found in Hallam's Middle Ages (i. 114, edition 1846), and still more in the Supplementary Notes (p. 118; and see specially Waitz, iv. 204). By the time of \u00c6thelstan a lordless man seems to have become something exceptional, and to have needed special legislation (see \u00c6thelstan's Laws in Schmid, 132. \"Be hlafordleasum mannum\"). The passages from the Capitularies quoted by Hallam imply the necessity of every man seeking a lord, though they leave to him the right of choosing what lord he will seek. There is another remarkable Capitulary of Lewis the Pious in the year 815 (Baluz. i. 552), in which the Emperor grants the power of Commendation, as an accustomed right of his own subjects, to the Spanish Christians who had taken refuge within his dominions from the oppression of the Saracens ; \" Noverint tamen iidem Hispani sibi licentiam a nobis esse concessam ut se in vassaticum commitibus nostris more solito commendet. Et si beneficium aliquod quis- quam eorum ab eo cui se commendavit fuerit consequutus, sciat se de illo tali obsequium seniori suo exhibere debere quale nostrates homines de simili beneficio senioribus suis exhibere solent.\" This is remarkable as showing the distinction between the personal Commendation of a man to his lord and the grant of a feudal benefice by that lord. The grant is not necessarily implied, but it is looked on as something which is likely to follow. \" Commen dati homines \" are often mentioned in Domesday, and there are"], [646, "APPENDIX. 598 numberless phrases which come to the same thing, though the exact words are not used. There is one very curious story in Hertfordshire (136 b), where a certain Godwine held lands for a life or lives of the church of Westminster, but after his death his widow illegally transferred the lordship of the lands to Eadgifu the Fair. \" Hanc terram tenuit Godwinus de ecclesia Sancti Petri; non potuit vendere, sed post mortem ejus debebat ad ecclesiam redire, ut hundreda testatur ; sed uxor ejus cum hac terra vertit se per vim ad Eddevam pulcram, et tenebat ea die qua Edwardus rex suit vivus et mortuus.\" This Godwine who could not sell his land is distinguished from various \" homines \" of Eadgifu \" qui potuerunt vendere.\" See more in vol. v. p. 885. This process of seeking a lord we find described in the Laws of \u00c6lfred (37, Schmid 90), where the proper formalities are de scribed ; \" Gif mon wille of bold-getale in otSer bold-get\u00e6l hlaford secan, do }>\u00e6t mid p\u00e6s ealdormonnes gewitnesse pe he \u00e6r in his scire folgode.\" And this phrase of seeking or choosing a lord is the very phrase which is used to express the international commenda tion of Wales and Scotland to the English King. In the Chronicles, 922, we read of Eadward, \"and pa cyningas on Norp Wealum, Howel and Cledauc and leopwel, and eall Norp Weallcyn hine sohton him to hlaforde.\" And in the famous passage which describes the great commendation of 924 (see above, p. 576) the words are, \" hine geces pa to feeder and to hlaforde Scotta cyning,\" &c. Of the use of the word as applied on an international scale there is an early instance in the letter of Pope Stephen to Pippin (Waitz, iii. 84 ; cf. 87), where he says, \"tarn ipsi Spoletani quam que etiam Beneventani omnes se commendare per nos a Deo servat\u00e6 excellenti\u00e6 tu\u00e6 cupiunt.\" But the best setting forth of the doctrine between sovereign princes is to be found in the words which Dudo (128 D) puts into the mouth of Hugh the Great, when he explains to young Richard the need of seeking a lord ; \"Hugo vero Magnus intelligens animadvertisse utrumque affectum voluntatis su\u00e6, aperta cordis sui intentioue dicitur respondisse : ' Non est quippe mos Franci\u00e6, ut quislibet princeps duxve con stipatus abundantius tanto milite perseveres cunctis diebus taliter in dominio ditionis su\u00e6, ut non aut famulatu voluntatis su\u00e6, aut coactus vi et potestate, incumbat acclivius Imperatori, vel"], [647, "GROWTH OF THE THEGNHOOD. 599 regi, ducive : et si forte perseveraverit in temeritate audaci\u00e6 su\u00e6, ut non famularetur alicui volenter pr\u00e6copiosa ubertate sufficienti\u00e6 su\u00e6; solent ei rix\u00e6 dissentionesque atque casus innumerabilis detrimenti s\u00e6pissime accidere. Quapropter si placuisset Richardo duci tuo nepoti seipsum flectere ut militaret mihi, vestro saluber rimo consilio sponte filiam meam connubio illi jungerem ; et terr\u00e6, quam hereditario jure possidet, continuus defeusor et adjutor contra omnes adessem.' \" NOTE O. p. 91. Growth of the Thegnhood. I cannot forbear transcribing the passage in which Mr. Kemble (Saxons in England, i. 183) sums up the general results of the growth of the Thegnhood. \" As the royal power steadily advanced by his assistance, and the old, national nobility of birth, as well as the old, landed freeman sunk into a lower rank, the gesicS found himself rising in power and consideration proportioned to that of his chief : the offices which had passed from the election of the freemen to the gift of the crown, were now conferred upon him, and the ealdorman, duke, gerefa, judge, and even the bishop, were at length selected from the ranks of the comitatus. Finally, the nobles by birth themselves became absorbed in the ever-widening whirlpool ; day by day the freemen, deprived of their old national defences, wringing with difficulty a precarious subsistence from incessant labour, sullenly yielded to a yoke which they could not shake off, and commended themselves (such was the phrase) to the protection of a lord ; till a complete change having thus been operated in the opinions of men, and consequently in every relation of society, a new order of things was consummated, in which the honours and security of service became more anxiously desired than a needy and unsafe freedom ; and the alods being finally surrendered, to be taken back as beneficia, under mediate lords, the foundations of the royal, feudal system were securely laid on every side.\" The supplanting of an older by a newer form of nobility has several parallels in history. The distinction between patricii and"], [648, "600 APPENDIX. nobiles at Rome has some analogies to the distinction between eorlas and pegnas in England. The plebeian could not become patrician, but he could become noble ; and this plebeian nobility, derived from the possession of curule magistracies, answered to our thegnhood in being a nobility of office, though in this case it was office conferred by the people and not by a King or other lord. See more in Comparative Politics, 246-270. On the growth of the official comitatus in the courts of the Frankish Kings and Emperors see the chapter of Waitz (iii. 410), \" Der Hof und die Reichs versammlung.\" He comments on the difference between this and the earlier comitatus; but both are instances of the same principle. See also iv. 278 of the same work, \"Dabei wird immer auch aus Abstammung, Ansehn des Geschlechtes Werth gelegt ; aber ein bes timmter rechtlicher Vorzug war damit nicht verbunden.\" He has collected a great number of cases of the use of the word nobilis and other equivalent words in the Carolingian age, that is to say, just at the point when the old notion of nobility had come to an end and when the new one had not fully developed itself. In that immediate stage nobility means simply to have meant free birth, or at all events free birth combined with the possession of land. NOTE P. p. 95. Grants of Folkland. I hope to say something more in my fifth volume about the tenure of land in England. I will here only give one or two specimens of the form of these grants. In 977 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 157) King Eadward makes a grant to \u00c6lfric (which \u00c6lfric?) in these terms; \"Aliquam partem terr\u00e6 juris mei perpetuali donatione libenter concedo cuidam fideli meo ministro [pegn] vocitato nomine \u00c6lfric, ob illius amabile obsequium dignatus sum largiri.\" He is to have it in full property, with the right of bequest, and to hold it free of all services \" exceptis istis tribus, expeditione, pontis arcisve munitione.\" So \u00c6thelred in 982 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 188) grants \"ruris quamdam sed communem portionem, quam hujus nationis indigen\u00e6 usitato \u00e6t Stoce nun cupant onomate, cuipiam mihi pislicd [one thinks of the irurroi in"], [649, "THE CONSTITUTION OF THE WITENAGEMOT. 601 the Persians of \u00c6schylus] devotione subnixo vocitamine Leofrico.\" The grantee is to have full power of bequest, and to hold the land \" ab omni terren\u00e6 servitutis jugo liberum, excepta expeditione, pontis arcisve restauratione.\" Fearful curses are imprecated on any one who shall disturb the grantees in their possessions. Bishops make grants to their own thegns of Church lands to be held for one, two, or three lives, and then to revert to the Church. The Codex contains a great many grants of this kind made by Bishop Oswald, the grant being made by leave of the King and of the reigning Ealdorman of the Mercians. In one, in English, which immediately follows the grant to \u00c6lfric (iii. 159), we find the trinoda necessitas duly excepted. \" Sie hit \u00e6lces pinges freoh buton ferdfare and walgeworc and brygcgeworc and cyrcanlade.\" The consent of the Witan is marked in the grant to Leofric by the words \" his testibus consentientibus quorum inferius nomina caraxantur.\" So Eadgar (iii. 153) makes a grant \" optimatum meorum utens consilio,\" &c, &c. The Codex Diplomaticus is of course the great store-house of knowledge on this subject. NOTE Q. p. 101. The Constitution of the Witenagem6t. I conceive that my notions about the Witenagemot do not differ essentially from those of Mr. Kemble. The process by which a primary Assembly in a large country naturally shrinks up into a small official or aristocratic body could not be better drawn out than they are in his chapter on the Witenagemot (Saxons in England, ii. 191 et seqq.). He winds up (p. 195) with the words ; \" At what exact period the change I have attempted to describe was effected, is neither very easy to determine nor very material. It was probably very gradual, and very partial ; indeed it may never have been . formally recognized, for here and there we find evident traces of the people's being present at, and ratifying the decisions of the Witan.\" In a note on the next page Mr. Kemble goes on to refute the strange notion of Sir Francis Palgrave (ii. ccclxxxvi.) that a property qualification was needed for a seat"], [650, "602 APPENDIX. in the Witenagemot. In fact Mr. Kemble's remarks are all that could be wished, if he had only brought forward more clearly some of those \" evident traces \" to which he cursorily alludes. I will try, partly at least, to fill up the gap. Take for instance the very beginning of recorded English legislation, the Dooms of \u00c6thelberht (Thorpe, i. 2) ; \"Gif cyning his leode to him gehated.\" Leode here surely means people in the widest sense. So in the Preface to the Laws of Wihtr\u00e6d (p. 36) ; \" D\u00e6r pa eadigan fundon mid ealra gemedum pas domas.\" The great men propose, the people accept, just as in the concilia described by Tacitus. So the deposition of Sigeberht in 755 (of which more in the next Note) was, according to Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 729 C), who is clearly following some earlier writer, the act of the whole West-Saxon people ; \" Congregati sunt proceres et populus totius regni, et provida deliberatione et unanimi consensu omnium expulsus est a regno. Kinewlf vero, juvenis egregius de regia stirpe oriundus, electus est in regem.\" So the \" Decretum Episco porum et aliorum sapientum de Kancia,\" addressed to \u00c6thelstan (Thorpe, i. 216), whatever its exact bearing, is drawn up in the name of the \" thaini, comites [eorlas], et villani [ceorlas].\" So the \" Judicia Civitatis Lundoni\u00e6 \" (p. 228, Schmid, 156) are con firmed by all, \" \u00e6gder ge eorlisce ge ceorlisce,\" in the Latin \"comites et villani.\" So in the Chronicles a popular element is often mentioned in the election of Kings and in other national acts. In 959 Eadgar was, according to Florence, \" ab omni Anglorum populo electus.\" In 1016 Eadmund is chosen by the Witan and the citizens (burhwaru) of London. So in 1036 Harold the First is chosen by most of the thegns north of Thames and by the liSsmen or sailors of London. In 104 1 \"all folk chose Eadward to King.\" So in 1066 Harold took the kingdom \"as men chose him thereto.\" So in 1048, when Godwine proposes to interfere in the wars of the North, \" hit puhte unr\u00e6d eallum folce.\" So too Godwine, on his return in 1052, makes his speech in the Mycel Gemot \"wiS Eadward cyng his hlaford and wi$ ealle landleodan.\" So with regard to a local body, in the account of a Scirgemot of Herefordshire in Cod. Dipl. iv. 54, though the thegns (\"ealle (Sa pegnas on Herefordscire \") are mentioned in a special way, yet the finaf judgement is given by the popular voice \u2014 \" be ealles cS\u0153s folces lease and gewitnesse.\" With regard to the action"], [651, "THE CONSTITUTION OF THE WITENAGEMClT. 603 of the citizens of London, the case no doubt simply was that they, being on the spot, could assert this right, which others at a distance could not do. But it must be remembered that till the eleventh century the Witan did not commonly meet either in London or in any other of the chief towns. Possibly, when a Gemot was held at Winchester or Exeter, the citizens of those towns would hold the same position as the Londoners did when the Gemot was held in their city. Something of this kind seems to be referred to in a charter of \u00c6thelstan (Cod. Dipl. ii. 194) of the year 934 \u2014 a charter remarkable on other grounds from the vast number of signatures, including four vassal Kings, and evidently passed in what was indeed a Mycel Gemot. It is given \" in civitate opinatissima [sic] qu\u00e6 Winteceaster nuncupatur, tota populi generalitate sub alis regi\u00e6 dapsilitatis ovanti.\" The citizens both of London and of Winchester seem to be mentioned as electors of Kings as late as the accession of Stephen. (See W. Malms., Hist. Nov. i. 11.) Even as late as 1461, Edward Earl of March was elected King by a tumultuous assembly of the citizens of London, and the citizens were foremost in the revolution which placed Richard the Third on the throne in 1483. These elections are fully described in Hall's Chronicle, pp. 253, 372. (See Growth of English Constitution, 204.) And that of Edward comes out well in the Collections of a London Citizen (Camden Society), 215, where we read how the Earl of March \"enteryed unto the cytte of London, and there he toke uppon hym the crowne of Inglond by the avysse of the lordys spyrytual aud temporalle, and by the elexyon of the comyns. And so he be-gan hys rayne.\" These are plainly the last traces of the right which the citizens had more regularly exercised in the elections of Eadmund Ironside and of Harold the son of Cnut. These passages seem distinctly to imply that every freeman had a theoretical right to attend. Some of the expressions used might be applied without impropriety to a representative assembly ; but they could not be applied to a body not representative, unless, in theory at least, it took in the whole nation. These passages prove also that some form of demanding the assent of the people at large was always retained. But the retention of some such usage is almost proved, without going any further, by the custom which still exists of presenting the King at his coronation for the acceptance"], [652, "604 APPENDIX. of the people (see vol. iii. Appendix E). This is at once the last trace of our elective monarchy, and the last vestige of the ancient right of the Teutonic freeman to take a direct part in the affairs of the nation. We may see the working of the same process on the continent in what Waitz, iii. 56, says of the Frankish Assemblies under the Karlings ; \" Das Volk, oder die Grossen, welche aus den allgemeinen Versammlungen im Namen des Volkes handelten.\" But in the quasi-official language of Einhard (Vita Kar. 1) it is \" publicus populi sui conventus,\" and the Continuator of Fredegar (117 a, 752) speaks of the change of dynasty as made \" cum consilio omnium Francorum.\" The charter of 934, which I have just quoted, starts a point of quite another kind, namely the question as to the attendance of the vassal Celtic princes in the English Witenagemot. On this I have said something in p. 132. The attendance of the Welsh Kings is not uncommon, especially in the reign of \u00c6thelstan. They often sign charters with the titles of subregulus or under cyning. See the signatures, ranging from 930 to 956 (Cod. Dipl. ii. 170, 173, 193, 196, 203, 292, 304, 326, 413 ; v. 199, 208, 217), of the subreguli Howel, Morcant, Owen, Juthwal, Tudor, Syferth, Jacob, Jukil, and Wurgeat. The Cumbrian signatures are rarer, but we have those of Eugenius in 931 (v. 199) and 937 (ii. 203), and of Malcolm in 966 and 970 (ii. 413, iii. 59). The signature of Kenneth of Scotland is attached to three charters (Cod. Dipl. ii. 413, iii. 69; Palgrave, ii. ccli. cclii.), but the authenticity of all three has been suspected. Still his preseuce at the great ceremony at Chester shows that the appearance of the King of Scots in the Witenagemot was a thing that might be looked for. The treaty between Bichard the First and William the Lion, by which the novel claims of Henry the Second were given up, contains elaborate rules for the reception of the King of Scots on his way to the King's court as due of ancient custom (Palgrave, ii. cccxxxix.). NOTE R. p. 106. The Right of the Witan to depose the King. Mr. Kemble (ii. 219) formally reckons among the powers of the Witan that they \"had the power to depose the King, if his"], [653, "THE RIGHT OF THE WITAN TO DEPOSE THE KING. 605 government was not conducted for the benefit of the people.\" He adds that \" it is obvious that the very existence of this power would render its exercise an event of very rare occurrence.\" He then goes on to discuss the case of Sigeberht at length, and adds, \"I have little doubt that an equally formal, though hardly equally justifiable, proceeding severed Mercia from Eadwig's kingdom, and reconstituted it as a separate state under Eadgar ; and lastly from Simeon of Durham we learn that the Northumbrian Alchred was deposed and exiled, with the counsel and consent of all his people.\" This last Northumbrian case is worth notice, as showing that a perfectly legal proceeding may lurk under words which at first sight seem to imply mere violence. The two Chronicles, Wor- cester and Peterborough, which record the deposition of Ealhred in the year 774, use the words, \"Her NortShymbra fordrifon heora cyning Alchred of Eoforwic on Eastertid, and genamon \u00c6pelred Molles sunu him to hlaforde.\" So Florence, \"Festi paschalis tempore Northymbrenses regem suum Alhredum, Molli regis successorem, Eboraco expulere, filiumque ejusdem regis Molli, \u00c6thelberhtum, in regem levavere.\" This might suggest the notion of a mere revolutionary act ; but the words of Simeon bring out the legal character of the deposition much more strongly; \" Alcre- dus rex, consilio et consensu suorum omnium, regi\u00e6 famili\u00e6 ac principum destitutus societate, exilio imperii mutavit majestatem.\" With this new light before us, we better understand the force of the words of the Chronicles, \" of Eoforwic on Eastertid.\" It is plain that Ealhred was deposed by the Easter Gemot of his kingdom assembled in his capital. Simeon then goes on to speak of \u00c6thelred as \"tanto honore coronatus ;\" and it should be noticed that in 779, when he records the expulsion of \u00c6thelred himself, richly deserved as it was by the treacherous murder of three of his Ealdormen, he does not use the same legal language ; \"Ethelredo expulso de regali solio et in exilio fugato, cogitur m\u0153stos inire modos miserasque habere querelas. Elfwald vero filius Oswlfi, Ethelredo expulso, regnum Northanhymbrorum sus cepit.\" So in the Chronicles (778), \"And pa feng Alfwold to rice and \u00c6peldred bedraf on lande.\" To turn to the case of Sigeberht, I have already quoted (see above, p. 400) the words of Henry of Huntingdon, in whose ac count the legal action of the nation stands out most clearly ; but"], [654, "606 APPENDIX. the consent of the Witan appears also in all the other accounts. In the Chronicles (755) we read, \" Her Cynewulf benam Sige bryhte his m\u00e6ge his rices and W\u00e6st-seaxna witan for unrihtum d\u00e6dum butan Hamtunscire.\" So Florence, \" Cynewlfus, de pro sapia Cerdici regis oriundus, auxilium sibi ferentibus West-Saxonicis primatibus, regem illorum Sigebertum, ob multitudinem suormn iniquorum factorum, reguo exterminavit, et loco ejus regnavit ; unam tamen provinciam, qu\u00e6 Hantunscire dicitur, eidem concessit.\" And even \u00c6thelweard (ii. 17), who seems to tell the story with a certain royalist leaning against Cynewulf, witnesses to the same facts ; \" Post decursum unius anni ex quo Sigebryht regnare c\u0153pe rat, cujus regnum invadens Cynulf abstraxit ab eo, et sapientes totius partis occidentalis facietenus traxit cum eo propter inconditos actus supradicti regis ; nee illi derelicta pars potestatis nisi pro vincia una qu\u00e6 Hamtunscire nuncupatur.\" In this case, as in the case of Ealhred, we may remark the different colourings given to the same action. The deposition of Sigeberht was clearly a legal act, but it might be spoken of as an \" invasio,\" just as equally legal acts later in our history could be also spoken of as \" invasiones.\" With regard to the separation of Mercia from the kingdom of Eadwig, spoken of by Mr. Kemble, the whole of Eadwig's reign is shrouded in such darkness that, as it forms no part of my imme diate subject, I have rather avoided going into it. But at any rate that separation would present one point of difference from any of the other cases. As Eadgar seems to have been Under-king of the Mercians from the death of Eadred, the act by which the Mercians threw off the authority of Eadwig was rather the rejec tion of the supremacy of an over-lord than the deposition of an immediate sovereign. Of the other cases which I have mentioned in the text, those which come within the range of my History I have discussed in their proper places. Among the later cases, some may have ex pected to see the names of Henry the Sixth and Charles the First. But neither of these Kings were, in strictness of speech, deposed. By deposition I understand an act by which a King, whose right to be King is acknowledged up to that time, is, by virtue of such act, declared to be no longer King. This was not exactly the esae with Henry the Sixth. When Richard Duke of York claimed the crown in preference to Henry, a compromise was made, by"], [655, "THE RIGHT OF THE WITAN TO DEPOSE THE KING. 607 which Henry was to keep the crown for life and Richard was to become his heir-apparent. It was therefore the Yorkist theory that Henry reigned by virtue of this agreement, and that, when he afterwards, as was alleged, broke the agreement, the Crown was thereby forfeited and the Duke became de jure King. (See Growth of the English Constitution, p. 149.) Yet, as we have seen, a kind of popular election was thought needful to confirm the rights of his son. Charles the First, it is still more clear, was not deposed. He was tried and executed being King, a process of which English history supplies no other example. The depositions of Edward the Second and Richard the Second are too plain to need comment. James the Second was clearly deposed in Scotland ; whether the vote against him in England could be strictly called a vote of deposition is less clear. On the character of this famous vote, logically so absurd, yet practically so thoroughly adapted to all the circumstances of the time, see Macaulay, Hist, of Eng. ii. 623. So on the vote of the Scottish Estates, iii. 285. I have spoken in the text of that milder form of deposition by which the King was removed from his authority without being formally removed from his office. Of this process the simpler forms of our early constitution will hardly supply an instance, unless we see an approach to it in the engagement (see p. 368) entered into by \u00c6thelred on his restoration to rule in all things by the advice of his Witan. But it was done in the cases of Henry the Third, Edward the Second, and Richard the Second ; in the two latter cases the act was a kind of forewarning of the severer punish ment which was to follow. It must be remembered that throughout this argument I am dealing with the legal right of deposition, not with the justice of its exercise in any particular case. As to Sigeberht, and as to Ealhred too, both of them clearly deserved their fate, but how far in either case the West-Saxon and Northumbrian Witan may have been influenced by any personal intrigues of Cynewulf or \u00c6thelred, who play in the two stories respectively the part of Henry of Bolingbroke or William of Orange, is not to the purpose. So too with the later fates of the deposed Kings, with the certain murder of Edward, the all but certain murder of Richard, the con stitutional question has nothing to do. The deposed prince was let off the most easily in the earliest case. Sigeberht, deposed from the"], [656, "608 APPENDIX. kingdom of Wessex, was allowed to retain Hampshire as Under-king. Having murdered one of his Ealdormen, he was banished altogether by Cynewulf, the new head King, and he was afterwards killed by a private enemy. For instances of deposition among other Teutonic nations see Kemble, ii. 221. The most famous case of all, the deposition of Childeric and election of Pippin, was somewhat spoiled by the application to the Bishop of Rome about a matter which it clearly lay within the power of the Frankish nation to settle without his interference. NOTE S. p. 107. The Election of Kings. Some passages bearing on the election of Kings by the Witan, that is in truth by the people, have been already quoted (see above, p. 602). At every stage of my history I shall have to call attention to the way in which the right of free election was carried out in prac tice. But it is worth while to point out how long the old Teutonic feeling survived, and at how late a time it was still formally put forth as a constitutional principle. Nowhere can a better exposi tion of the ancient doctrine as to the election of Kings be found than in the speech which Matthew Paris (Chronica Majora, ii. 454, ed. Luard) puts into the mouth of Archbishop Hubert at the election of King John. Whether the speech is Hubert's or Matthew's matters little ; or rather, if it be Matthew's own, it is the more valuable, as carrying on the ancient tradition still later. No one has any right to be King unless he be chosen by the whole people of the land on account of his merits (\" nullus pr\u00e6via ratione alii succedere habet regnum, nisi ab universitate regni unanimiter, invocata Spiritus gratia, electus \"), but if any member of the royal family be worthy, he is to be preferred to any one else (\"verum si quis ex stirpe regis defuncti aliis pr\u00e6polleret, pronius et promptius in electionem ejus est consentiendum \"). The preamble is excellent, but the practical inference is strange, nameiy that Duke John, for his many virtues, should be chosen King. With this speech, made by, or attributed to, an English Archbishop, we may compare the similar doctrine of elective"], [657, "NAMES OF KINGDOMS AND NATIONS. 609 monarchy laid down by a French Archbishop, Adalbero of Rheims, at the election of Hugh Capet in 987; \"Non ignoramus Karolum fautores suos habere, qui eum dignum reguo ex parentum col latione contendant. Sed si de hoc agitur, nee regnum jure h\u00e6reditario adquiritur, nee in regnum promovendus est nisi quem non solum corporis nobilitas, sed et animi sapientia illus trat, fides munit, magnanimitas firmat. Legimus in annalibus, clarissimi generis Imperatoribus ignavia ab dignitate pr\u00e6cipitatis, alios modo pares, modo impares successisse.\" (Ridier, iv. 11.) So again the combination of the elective and hereditary principles, as found in all the old Teutonic kingdoms, is well set forth by Rudolf Glaber, i. 3 ; \" Totius regni primates elegerunt Ludovicum, filium videlicet pr\u00e6dicti regis Caroli, unguentes eum super se regem h\u00e6re ditario jure regnaturum.\" We shall find as nearly as possible the same words in an important passage of our Chronicles (A. 1042). NOTE T. p. 151. Names of Kingdoms and Nations. It should be carefully borne in mind that, throughout the times with which we are dealing, two systems of geographical nomenclature were in use, we might say in rival use. The ancient names, Roman or ante-Roman, still survived, as many of them survive still, as purely geographical descriptions, and the new names, the names of states and kingdoms named after their inhabitants, were still only in pro cess of forming. I have said something of this in an earlier Note (see above, p. 596) with regard to the nomenclature of our own island ; the nomenclature of continental countries we shall find to be still more confused. But the two classes of names can be clearly distinguished. Gallia and Britannia were doubtless in their origin names derived from a people, no less than Francia and Anglia ; but, in the times with which we have to deal, Gallia and Britannia had become purely geographical terms, simply expressing a certain extent of territory on the map, while Francia and Anglia (if the latter name was used at all) were political names, expressing the territory occupied or ruled by Franci and Angli. The shifting of names of this latter class are frequent and well known. The W> modern kingdom of Saxony, for instance, has not an inch of ground vol. 1. R r"], [658, "APPENDIX. 610 in common with the Saxony which was conquered by Charles the Great, and the various meanings of the word Burgundy have become a proverb among the learned and a touchstone to bewray the half-learned. Another cause of confusion is that the ancient geographical names were constantly used, not only in their straight forward geographical sense, but also by way of fine writing, in which case they are constantly used affectedly, and often inac curately. This is especially the case with Richer. Take for instance the opening of his second book, where he describes the political parties of his own day in the geographical language of C\u00e6sar, \" Galli namque Celt\u00e6 cum Aquitanis Hugonem Rotberti regis filium, Belg\u00e6 vero Ludovicum Karoli sequebantur.\" Here we get a real distinction of race and language. The Celt\u00e6 and Aquitani are the nations of the Romance tongues, the forerunners of the future French and the future Provencal, while the Belg\u00e6 mark the still Teutonic part of the kingdom, whose inhabitants Richer elsewhere (i. 47) distinctly calls Germani. But none would guess this from the antiquated phraseology which he chooses. A still more re markable instance of Richer's way of misusing antiquated terms will be found in a passage which seems to have misled Sir Francis Palgrave. Sir Francis, describing the campaign of 944 (see p. 225) says (ii. 543), \"Among other vassals or dependants . . . Otho was joined by Conrad ' King of Geneva,' under which style we might have some difficulty in recognizing the King of Burgundy, yet the title is not undeserving of notice, as embodying the very few remaining recollections of a kingdom practically effaced from his torical memory.\" This I do not understand. As Sir Francis gives no references, I cannot undertake to deny that Conrad may be called \" King of Geneva \" somewhere, but he certainly is not so called in any of the most obvious authorities for this campaign. Widukind does not mention him at all. In Flodoard (A. 946) he is, as usual, \"Cisalpin\u00e6 Galli\u00e6 rex.\" In Richer (ii. 53) he is \" Rex Genaunorum.\" (Did Sir Francis read \" Genevanorum\"?) It is strange geography of Richer to place the Genauni in Bur gundy, but we find again in ii. 98, \"urbem Vesontium, qu\u00e6 est metropolis Genaunorum, cui etiam in Alpibus sit\u00e6 Aldis Dubis pr\u00e6terfluit.\" The ecclesiastical province of Besancon answers almost exactly to Transjurane Burgundy. In iii. 86 the same Conrad is, still more wonderfully, made into \" Rex Alemannorum.\""], [659, "NAMES OF KINGDOMS AND NATIONS. 611 Richer, in short, despised the geography of bis own age, aud used his obsolete names without much discretion. But this affectation extends to better writers than Richer. Lam bert himself constantly uses the word Galli\u0153 in a vague sort of way, or rather as equivalent to Germany. Thus, for instance, we hear of the church of Fulda as one of the chief churches of the Gauls (\" illius monasterii opes usque ad id temporis florentissim\u00e6 erant cunctisque Galliarum ecclesiis eminebant.\" A 1063), while Mainz (A. 1074) is \"caput et princeps Gallicarum urbium.\" And the word is used in the same sense in several other passages under those two years. So, as I have implied in discussing Richer's description of Conrad, the name \" Gallia Cisalpina,\" as used by Flodoard, always, I cannot conceive why, means the kingdom of Burgundy or some part of it (see A. 924, 937, 939, 946). Of these the third is the passage referred to in p. 203. M. Gaudet in his note on Richer takes the \" Hugo Cisalpinus \" there spoken of for Hugh the Black, one of the Princes of the ducal Burgundy who is mentioned by Flodoard the next year. But there can be no doubt that the person meant is Hugh of Provence, the famous King of Italy. But the great source, not so much of confusion as of vague and strange descriptions or rather indications of kingdoms and states, arises from the fact that none of the states formed by the division of the Carolingian Empire, none at least of those north of the Alps, had as yet won for itself a geographical name. There were old national names in abundance, Saxony, Bavaria, Aquitaine, Britanny, but there were no general names to express the kingdoms of Charles, Lothar, and Lewis, respectively. Each King was a King of the Franks ; he reigned over so much of the old Frankish dominion as he could get hold of; he had no distinct and recog- nized national or territorial title ; he and his kingdom had to be described, or rather pointed out, as they might be. We nowhere see this better than in the way in which our own Chronicles under the year 887 record the division of the Empire after the deposition of Charles the Third. The four kingdoms are clearly marked out, but not one of the four has a territorial name ; the three which lie north of the Alps are simply pointed to geographically ; \" Earnulf wunode on pam lande be \u00e6stan Rine ; and HrotSulf pa feng to pam middel rice, and Oda to pam west d\u00e6le, and Beorngar and WiSa to r r 2"], [660, "612 APPENDIX. Langbeardna lande.\" This is at least clearer than the description given by Erchempert (Hist. Langobardorum, n; Pertz, iii. 245) of the earlier division between the sons of Lewis the Pious ; \" Ab hoc Francorum divisum est regnum, quoniam Lutharius Aquensem et Italicum, Ludoguicus [this form, with the git for the w, is worth noting philologically] autem Baioarium, Karlus vero, ex alia ortus genitrice, Aquitaneum regebat imperium.\" Here, in the hopeless ness of finding a name for Lothar's kingdom, we find an unique \"regnum\" or \"imperium Aquense,\" while Saxony and the rest of Germany are merged in Bavaria, and Neustria is merged in Aquitaine. Another way of distinguishing kingdoms and their inhabitants was to describe them by the names of their rulers, as in the passage of Widukind (i. 29) quoted in p. 155; \"Unde usque hodie certamen est de regno Karolorum stirpi et posteris Odonis, concertatio quoque regibus Karolorum et Orientalium Fran corum super regno Lotharii.\" Here \"regnum Lotharii\" is of course Lotharingia, Lothringen, Lorraine, though it must be re membered that the name takes in a far wider territory than the modern duchy. So Gregory the Seventh (Jaffe, Mon. Greg. 465) speaks of \"regnum Lotharii\" and Bonitho (ib. 631) of \"Lotha riorum regnum.\" And in the continuation of Regino (Pertz, i. 618) \" Lothariensi regnum \" is opposed to Gallia Romana. But it should also be noticed that the Western Kingdom also has no name ; its Kings are \" reges Karolorum ; \" it was quite a chance that France was not permanently called Carolingia to match Lotharingia. So in Widukind (iii. 2) the Western kingdom is \"regnum Karoli,\" though in the reign of a Lewis ; so, still more distinctly, in the Gesta Episcoporum Cameracensium (i. 55, iii. 50 ; Pertz, vii. 421, 481) the inhabitants of France and Lotharingia are distinguished as \" Karlenses \" and \" Lotharienses.\" So in the same work (i. 116; Pertz, vii. 452) \"Robertus rex Karlensium\" is coupled with \"Richardus rex Rotomagensium.\" And strangest of all, in the Chronicle of the Counts of Flanders (Corp. Chron. Fland. i. 86) the Emperor Henry the Third is spoken of as \" Rex Lothariensis, qui et C\u00e6sar Imperator Augustus appellatus est.\" (So in our own Chronicle, n 26, \"pone kasere Heanri of Loherenge ;\" in the next year we hear of \"r5es Caseres wif of Sexlande.\") This way of describing countries by their rulers is very common just at this time, when divisions were springing up for which there were no"], [661, "NAMES OF KINGDOMS AND NATIONS. 613 received geographical names. Thus Germany is sometimes \" Terra Heimici\" (Flodoard, 933); Flanders and Normandy are, in our own Chronicles, \"\u25a0 Baldwines land \" and \" Ricardes rice.\" But Lotharingia, perhaps as the name of the most purely artificial division of all, is the only name of the class which has survived. This same passage leads us to the way which (except in the case of Lotharingia, a kingdom which almost always bore the name of its founder) became more usual, that of distinguishing the kingdoms and their inhabitants by some distinctive epithet of race or lan guage, or by some word which simply points to them geographically. The difficulty, as I have already hinted, arises from the still abiding notion of the existence of a single Frankish kingdom, however many might be the Kings among whom its administration was divided. None of the Kings, nor yet the subjects of any of the Kings, would give up their right to be at least one of the Kings of the Franks, to be at least part of the people of the Franks. While such a state of feeling was rife, it was impossible that any King or kingdom should bear any title distinctly and permanently recog nized. A King most commonly describes himself simply as \" Rex ; \" any more particular description might have been construed either as a surrender of his own rights or as an infringement of the rights of some other prince. Thus it has often been remarked that in the act of election (see Pertz, Legg. i. 547, cf. the election of Lewis at p. 558) by which Boso was raised to the kingship of Burgundy \u2014 the \" middel rice \" of our Chronicles \u2014 he is simply made King without any particular title, and without any particular geogra phical extent being traced out for his kingdom. It was not so while the Frankish dominions remained undivided. In the days of the early Karlings, the King had a title and his dominions had a name. His dominions were Francia ; he himself was the Rex Fran corum. In Einhard, Francia means the whole territory occupied or ruled by the Franks and their King. This comes out very strongly in the Life of Charles, c. 2 ; \" Pater ejus [Pippini] Karolus, qui tyrannos per totam Franciam dominatum sibi vindicantes oppressit, et Sarracenos Galliam ocoupare tentantes duobus magnis pr\u0153liis, uno in Aquitania apud Pictavium civitatem, altero juxta Narbonam apud Birram fluvium devicit.\" Here, with the strictest precision, Gallia is a part of Francia and Aquitania is a part of Gallia. And this will be found to be the common use throughout"], [662, "APPENDIX. 614 the Life and Annals. So the Monk of Saint Gallen (Gesta Karoli, i. 10; Pertz, ii. 735) defines Francia in the widest sense to take in \"omnes Cis-alpinas provincias.\" But the name Francia gradually came to be confined to two portions of the original Francia, one on each side of the Rhine, those where the name still survives alike in France and in Franken or Franconia. These two had therefore to be distinguished by various epithets. Thus we find \"Francia Teutonica \" opposed to \" Francia Latina \" and \" Francia Orien talis\" opposed to \" Francia Occidentalis.\" Sometimes \"Francia\" and \" Gallia \" are opposed, as in Ann. Xant. 877 (Pertz, ii. 234), and the use is not uncommon in the Annals of Fulda, as 880 (i. 393). See too specially Bruno, Bell. Sax. 36 (Pertz, v. 342), and Liudjrrand (Antapodosis, i. 14, 16), who talks of \"Franciam quam Romanam dicunt,\" and elsewhere (iii. 20) of \" Francorum genus Teutonicorum.\" See also Widukind, i. 16, 29 ; Wfpo, Vit. Chuon. 1, 6, 27, and especially c. 2, where he describes the Rhine as the frontier of \" Gallia \" and \" Germania,\" and reckons up the nations in both countries which formed the kingdom of Conrad, among which are \" Franci Orientales,\" and \" Franci qui supra Rhenum habitant,\" an unusual distinction. See also Otto of Freising, Gest. Frid. i. 34, where he speaks of \" Orientalis Francia,\" and Ann. vii. 5, where he distinguishes \" Franci Romani et Teutonici.\" In the Annals of Saint Vedast, 887 (Pertz, ii. 203), we find \"Franci Australes\" and \"inferiores;\" but in those Annals \"Franci\" and \"Francia\" commonly mean the Western kingdom. The word is some times used in this sense in the phrases \" rex Franci\u00e6 \" and \" regnum Franci\u00e6\" (see above, p. 595, and Dudo, 97 D). But Francia, as used by writers within the Western kingdom, commonly means the Parisian duchy, and it is only through the successive conquests of the Parisian Kings that the word France has gained that modern meaning which now takes in the old Western kingdom and some thing more. The ordinary meaning of the word Francia in Flodoard and Richer is plain from such passages as Flodoard, A. 923, 926. It means the dominion of the \" Dux Francorum,\" whether he be \" Rex Francorum \" as well or not. In the latter passage, we find a Danegeld levied \" per Franciam et Burgundiam,\" where Burgundia does not mean the kingdom of Boso, but the duchy which did homage to the West-Frankish King. So in the Vita Hludowici, 49, we find \" Francia, Burgundia, Aquitania, et Germania.\" Fran-"], [663, "NAMES OF KINGDOMS AND NATIONS. 615 cia, in short, as used by these writers, excludes Lotharingia and all the Burgundies ; it excludes Aquitaine, Normandy, and Britanny ; and it has further to be distinguished as \" Latina \" or \" Occidenta lis \" from the other Francia east of the Rhine. In the like sort, we read iu the Chronica Regum Francorum, ap. Pertz, iii. 214; \" Hie [at the deposition of Charles the Third] divisio facta est inter Teutones Francos et Latinos Francos.\" But it is remarkable to trace how early, especially within the Western Francia, the word Franci began to mean the Western as opposed to the Eastern Franks. Thus the Astronomer (ap. Pertz, ii. 617) speaks of Lewis the Pious as \" monitus tam a Francis quamque a Germanis,\" and again (p. 633), \" diffidens Francis, magisque se credens Germanis.\" So Liudprand (Antapod. i. 14, 17) uses \"Rex Galli\u00e6 \" and \" Rex Francorum \" as synonymous. And the word seems to be used in the same sense by Nithard, i. 5, ii. 3, in the former of which passages Francia seems to be opposed to \" universi qui trans Renum morabantur.\" So Wipo (31) distinguishes the Western kingdom as \"Galli\u00e6 Francorum,\" and Lambert (1073), unlike Bruno, allows the title of \" Rex Francorum\" to the Western potentate. Still in Germany Franci kept its natural meaning clown to the days of Frederick Barbarossa. \" Sic emitur a Francis Imperium,\" says Otto of Freising (Gest. Frid. ii. 22). Yet else where (i. 58) he speaks of \"Rex Francorum\" and \"Rex Fran ci\u00e6\" in the other sense. So William of Malmesbury (i. 68), in a passage the whole of which is worth study, says, \" Lotharingi et Alemanni, et c\u00e6teri Transrhenani populi qui Imperatori Teutoni corum subjecti sunt, magis proprie se Francos appellari jubent ; et eos quos nos Francos putamus, Gahvalas antiquo vocabulo [did William know the force of the walasl] quasi Gallos nuncupant. Quibus et ego assensum commodo,\" &c. Elsewhere (iv. 360) he says, \" Romanum Imperium prius ad Francos, post ad Teutones, decli navit;\" he yet more strangely adds, \" orientale apud Persas semper durat.\" In other cases the words Franci or Francia are altogether left out. \" Occidentales \" alone is used as equivalent to West-Frankish or French, and \"Orientales\" is used as equivalent to German. Perhaps the most remarkable case \"of this use is to be found in the treaty between Charles the Simple and Henry of Saxony in 921 (Pertz, Legg. i. 567). Here the two Kings of the"], [664, "APPENDIX. 616 Franks are geographically distinguished, as \" Gloriosissimus rex Francorum Occidentalium, Karolus \" and \" Magnificentissimus rex Francorum Orientalium Heinricus.\" But in the text of the treaty, where Charles speaks in his own person, he says, \"Ego Karolus, divina propitiante dementia, rex Francorum Occidentalium, amodo ero huic amico meo regi Orientali Heinrico amicus.\" We find the same use in Dudo, 130 B, and in a very remarkable passage of Richer (iv. 12, 13), where he gives two descriptions of the extent of the Western kingdom in the tenth century. Hugh Capet is made King over \" Galli, Britanni, Dahi [doubtless Dani, i.e. the Normans], Aquitani, Gothi, Hispani [the county of Barcelona], Wascones.\" He then associates his son Robert in the kingdom \u2014 \"a Mosa fluvio usque Oceanum Occidentalibus regem pr\u00e6fecit et ordinavit.\" So in the extract from Thietmar in p. 175, \" Occidu\u00e6 partes\" is the German writer's description of the kingdom of Charles the Simple. In other passages a King is simply, as it were, pointed at. In Flodoard, 938, Otto is \" Rex Transrhenensis,\" in Richer, i. 20, his father is simply \" Heinricus Transrhenensis,\" and in Dudo, 130 B, where the Germans are still \" Orientales,\" their King is still \"Rex Transrhenanus.\" So \"Rex Orientalis \" is opposed to \"Rex Galli\u00e6,\" Ann. Xant. 873 (Pertz, ii. 235). More curious still is the description of no less a person than Hugh the Great in Flodoard, A. 960 ; \" Richardus, filius Willelmi Nort mannorum principis, filiam Hugonis trans Sequanam [or ' Trans sequani '] quondam principis, duxit uxorem.\" So in 946 our Eadmund is \" Edmundus rex transmarinus.\" See above, p. 565. This way of describing suggests some of those curious medi\u00e6val verbs, \" transfretare,\" \" transpadare,\" and the like. Germany in fact was longer than any of the other countries of which we have been speaking in getting a true territorial name for itself, and a true territorial title for its sovereign. We have seen several instances of the use of Germania ; but then Germania, like Gallia, is a purely geographical name, and the Eastern kingdom took in a large part of Gallia. The kingdom itself is commonly \" Regnum Teutonicum \" (Lambert, 1073), a phrase which is the more remarkable when we find it coupled with the geographical name Italia, as in Gregory's anathema in Muratori, iii. 336. Lewis the son of Lewis the Pious is repeatedly called \" Rex Germanorum\" by Prudentius of Troyes (Pertz, i. 441, 443), and"], [665, "NOTICES OF LANGUAGE IN THE TENTH CENTURY. 617 \" Bex Germani\u00e6 \" by Hincmar (Pertz, i. 458). So Henry is \"Germanise princeps \" in Flodoard, 928. But these are mere descriptions, and no such formal title seems to be found earlier than the days of Maximilian. Indeed the German kingdom was so soon swallowed up by the Roman Empire that a distinct title for its King was hardly needed. The kingdom of Boso, on the other hand, though he and his electors shrank from giving it a name, soon found one in common use. Liudprand (Ant. ii. 60) tells how \"Rodulfusrex superbissimus Burgundionibus imperabat,\" and Wipo speaks familiarly (15, 19) of \"Rex Burgundi\u00e6\" and \" Burgundionum.\" Flodoard, however, besides his favourite flourish about Cisalpine Gaul, tells us of \" Rex Jurensis \" under the years 935 and 940. Lastly, the Norman duchy, as I have once or twice implied in the text, was also slow in gaining for itself any distinct territorial name. There is no trace of any such name in Flodoard or in Richer. In Dudo's time the country is beginning, but only beginning to have a name ; it is sometimes \" Northmannia,\" some times only \" Terra Northmannorum,\" \" Northmannica regio,\" and the like. In the next century the people have become \"Normanni,\" and their land has become \" Normannia,\" \" Normendie.\" \" North mannia,\" with Einhard, meant Denmark. In Adam of Bremen \"Nortmannia\" means distinctively Norway, though he also uses the word \" Norvegia.\" With him \" Nortmanni \" always means Norwegians, except in ii. 52, where Richard is described as \" Comes Nortmannorum \" and his duchy as \" Nortmannia.\" It is perhaps needless to add that in our own Northumbrian geo graphy the local names Normanton and Normanby point to Northmen, not to Normans, just as the word \" Norpmen \" is used in our own Chronicles in describing the Commendation of 923- NOTE V. p. 158.

We get perhaps our first glimpse of this feeling in Nithard's description (iii. 5) of the famous oath of Strassburg in 842. The two languages, the parents of modern High-Dutch and modern French, are distinguished as \"lingua Teudisca\" and \"lingua Romana.\" Charles the Bald himself spoke Lingua Romana ; Pertz, Legg. i. 472. \" Romana,\" Romance, is the usual description of the new language, as distinguished from the classical \" Latina,\" though we have seen (see p. 182) at least one instance where \" Latinus sermo \" means the popular Romance. In the course of the next century the language became nationalized, and in Richer (iv. 100) it appears as \" lingua Gallica,\" which becomes its usual later name. I leave to professed philologers to fix the exact relation of the \" lingua Romana \" of Nithard to French and to Provencal respec tively. For my purpose it is enough that it is Romance, as distinguished both from Latin and from Teutonic. We also in the course of the narratives of Flodoard and Richer come across several curious passages where the Romance and Teutonic languages are opposed to each other. Thus Charles the Simple has a conference at Worms with Henry of Saxony (\" Heinricus Transrhenensis \"), when (Richer, i. 20) \" Germanorum Gallorumque juvenes, linguarum idiomate offensi, ut eorum mos est, cum multa animositate maledictis sese lacessire c\u0153perunt.\" In 948 Lewis and Otto attend a synod, where letters are read in Latin, and are translated \"propter reges juxta Teutiscam linguam.\" (Flod. in an. ; Pertz, iii. 396.) Lewis therefore spoke German no less than Otto. Otto however (see Widukind, ii. 36) could speak French on occasion (\" Romana lingua Slavanicaque loqui scit \"), which makes the employment of German still more im portant. In 981 Hugh Capet and Otto the Second met. Otto spoke Latin, and a Bishop translated his speech to Hugh. (Richer, iii. 85.) Hugh therefore did not understand German, and the Romance which he spoke had departed so far from Latin that Latin needed an interpreter. In 996 certain Gaulish and German Bishops meet (Richer, iv. 100), and the Bishop of Verdun is chosen to speak \" eo quod linguam Gallicam norat.\" The Lotharingian prelate could doubtless speak both languages. These passages seem enough to make out the view which I have everywhere maintained, that throughout the tenth century the Carolingian Kings at Laon were a strictly German dynasty, speaking German"], [667, "NOTICES OF LANGUAGE IN THE TENTH CENTURY. 619 as their mother-tongue, while the Dukes and Kings of Paris were already French. Sir Francis Palgrave's assertion (i. 72) that \"the German Ritterschaft of Otho the Great raised the war-cry in French \" is an evident misconception of the passage in Widukind (ii. 17) on which it seems to be grounded. The historian is clearly speak ing of the Lotharingian borderers who spoke both languages. His words are simply, \" Ex nostris etiam fuere, qui Gallica lingua ex parte loqui seiebant, qui clamore in altum Gallice levato, exhortati sunt adversarios ad fugam.\" Of the speed with which French displaced Danish as the language of Normandy, I have said something in p. 181. For the retention of the ancient speech at Bayeux, after it had been forgotten at Rouen, our chief authority is Dudo, 112 D; \" Quo niam quidem Rotomagensis civitas Romana potius quam Daeisca utitur eloquentia, et Baiocacensis fruitur frequentius Daeisca lingua quam Romana ; volo igitur ut ad Baiocacensia deferatur quantocius mcenia, et ibi volo ut sit, Botho, sub tua custodia, et enutriatur et educetur cum magna diligentia, fervens loquacitate Daeisca, tamque discens tenaci memoria, ut queat sermocinari profusius olim contra Dacigenas.\" (\" Contra sermocinari,\" in Dudo's language, is simply to converse with.) So Benoit, 11 520; \"Si a Eoem le faz garder E norir, gaires longement 11 ne saura parlier neient Daneis, kar nul l'i parole. Si voil qu'il seit a tele eseole Ou 1'en le sache endoctriner Que as Daneis sache parler. Ci ne sevent riens fors romanz ; Mais a Baiues en a tanz Qui ne sevent si Daneis non : E pur ceo, sire quens Boton, Voil que vos l'aiez ensemble od vos.\" Wace (Roman de Rou, 2502) says only \"Richart sout en Daneiz, en Normant parler.\" Here \" Normant \" can mean nothing but French, but it is less clear what he means by it in v. 2377, where we read, \"Cosne sout en Thioiz et en Normant parler.\" Wace probably meant French, but he seems to have misunderstood a passage of Dudo (99, 100) which contains a curious notice of the use of the Danish language, the force of which Dudo himself seems hardly to have understood. William is at a conference with Henry of Germany (really with Otto). Certain Lotharingians and Saxons"], [668, "APPENDIX. 620 talk to their own chief Cono; William, by his knowledge of Danish, understands them (\" per Daciscam linguam qu\u00e6 dicebant subsanuantes, intelligendo subaudit\"). The Saxon Duke Hermann afterwards speaks to William in Danish, and being asked how the Saxons came to understand that language, explains the fact by the constant incursions of the Northmen. Duke Hermann might very well understand Danish, and might speak Danish to William ; but the Saxons and Lotharingians would not speak Danish to Cono. What the story seems to point to is that the Low-Dutch of Saxony and Lower Lorraine was so far intelligible to one who understood Danish that he could guess at the general meaning of what was said. But the most remarkable notice of language at all is to be found in the Tours Chronicle in Duchesne, Rer. Franc. Scripts, iii. 36c, which records the homage of Rolf to Charles (see p. 168), and the traditional origin of the name Bigot as applied to the Normans. When Rolf is called on to kiss the King's feet, \" lingua Anglica respondit, Ne se bigoth, quod interpretatur, non per Deum, rex vero et sui ilium deridentes, et sermonem ejus corrupte referentes, ilium vocaverunt Bigoth. Unde Normanni adhuc Bigothi dicun tur\" (see Wace, 9907, et seqq.). Here we read that this famous refusal of Rolf to abase himself was made in a language which by Frankish hearers was looked upon as English. That Rolf spoke English in any strict sense is most unlikely ; the tongue in which he answered was doubtless his native Danish. Nor is it enough to say, with Sir F. Palgrave (i. 70.0), that any Teutonic speech was loosely called English by the French ; for Rolf was speaking in the presence of a prince whose native speech was undoubtedly Teutonic. But Charles the Frank spoke High-Dutch ; Rolf the Dane spoke a language which, in a wide sense of the words, might be called Low-Dutch. England was the most famous and most familiar country of the Low-Dutch speech, and the Scandinavian talk of Rolf was by his Frankish hearers accordingly set down as English. NOTE W. pp. 168, 222. The Vassaxage of Normandy. That Rolf became in the strictest sense the \" man \" of King Charles, I have no doubt whatever. Against plain facts and"], [669, "THE VASSALAGE OF NORMANDY. 621 probabilities we have nothing to set except the shirkings and twistings of Dudo's rhetoric. Thus he tells us (83 D) ; \" Dedit itaque [Karolus] filiam suam Gislam nomine uxorem illi Duci, terramque determinatam in alodo, et in fundo, a flumine Ept\u00e6 usque ad mare, totamque Britanniam, de qua posset vivere.\" And again (84 A) ; \" Ceterum Karolus rex, duxque Rotbertus, comi tesque et proceres, pr\u00e6sules et abbates, juraverunt sacramento Catholic\u00e6 fidei patricio Rolloni vitam suam, et membra, et honorem totius regni, insuper terram denominatam,\" &c. See Palgrave, ii. 361. And he is rather fond of speaking of Normandy as a kingdom or a monarchy ; \" Tenet sicuti rex monarchiam North mannic\u00e6 regionis ; \" \" Regnum Northmannic\u00e6 Britonic\u00e6que regio nis.\" (no D ; 128 B, C; 136 C.) Still the homage of Rolf is perfectly plain, and so is the homage of his son William Longsword. (See pp. 168, 196.) The testimony of Flodoard (927, cf. 933) is express ; \" Se filius Rollonis Karolo committit.\" But whether Richard the Fearless ever did homage to Lewis or Lothar is not so clear. Richard may be included among the \" c\u00e6teri regni primores\" who (seep. 221) did homage to Lewis in 946. Dudo however (126 C) seems very anxious to except him; \"Venit rex supra fluvium Ept\u00e6 contra Northmannos, cum magno duce Hugone. . . . Propriis verbis fecit securitatem regni quod suus avus Rollo vi ac potestate, armis et pr\u00e6liis sibi acquisivit. Ipse que et omnes episeopi, comites, et abbates reverendi, principesque Franci\u00e6 regni Richardo puero innocenti, ut teneat et possideat, et nullis nisi Deo servitium ipse et successio ejus reddat, et si quis pervers\u00e6 invasionis rixatione contra eum congredi, vel alicujus rixationis congressione invadere regnum, maluerit, fidissimus adjutor in omni advers\u00e6 inopportunitatis necessitate per omnia exstiterit.\" As for any homage to Lothar (see p. 232), I suspect that no such homage was ever rendered. The French writers do not mention it, though they would doubtless have been glad to mention it if it had happened. And Flodoard's way of speaking of Richard is remarkable. William was \"the Prince of the Normans ;\" Richard is only \" the son of William Prince of the Normans \" (\" filius Willelmi Northmannorum principis;\" see p. 232, note 3). But I have no doubt that the homage was lawfully due, and it was most likely its refusal which led to the differences between Lothar and Richard. On the other hand,"], [670, "022 APPENDIX. the Commendation of Richard to Hugh the Great (see p. 222) seems to be quite authentic, and it is clear that it was renewed to Hugh's son. This appears from a charter, which I am obliged to quote at secondhand from Lappenberg, Norman Kings, p. 30. Richard there uses the words, \" cum assensu senioris mei, Hugonis, Francorum principis.\" The date is 968 ; the lord therefore is Hugh Capet. With regard to this matter a remarkable passage of Sir Francis Palgrave (ii. 494-5) must be quoted and commented on. His words are, \" A perfect reciprocity was established between France and the ' Norman Monarchy.' . . . That Dominion which Rollo the Grandsire had won by so many battles, Richard shall hence forward have and hold, owing service to none but God. . . . Should any enemy attempt to disturb the right of the Norman Sovereign, the King of France shall be his help and aid in all things. . . . No other service shall Normandy render unless the King should grant the Duke some Benefice within the Kingdom of France. Therefore, as it was explained in after-time, the Duke of Normandy doth no more than promise faith and homage to the King of France. In like manner doth the King of France render the same fealty to the Duke of Normandy ; nor is there any other difference between them, save that the King of France doth not render homage to the Duke of Normandy like as the Duke of Normandy doth to the King.\" If I rightly understand Sir Francis Palgrave, his meaning is that the Duke of the Normans ceased from that time to be the man of the King of the French ; that he merely entered into a treaty on equal terms with his former lord ; that by voluntary commendation he became the man of the Duke of the French ; that the later vassalage of Normandy to France was due, not to the kingdom of France but to the duchy, that it had its beginning in the homage done by Richard the Fearless to Duke Hugh, not in the homage done by Rolf to King Charles. I say, if I rightly understand Sir Francis, because I cannot quite reconcile his statements with one another. In one page there \" is perfect reciprocity established between France and the Norman monarchy.\" Richard has and holds his dominion, owing service to none but God, \u2014 yet directly afterwards it is allowed that \" the Duke of Normandy promises fealty and homage to the King of France.\""], [671, "THE VASSALAGE OF NORMANDY. 623 It is dangerous to dispute with Sir Francis Palgrave on a question of feudal law, and the more so, as the relations between Normandy and France at once awaken the whole controversy about \"liege\" and \"simple\" homage. But surely, even in a case of simple homage, there is not \"perfect reciprocity\" between him who pays and him who receives the homage ; and certainly, in the tale as I read it, I see nothing but the simple relation of lord and man, only clouded over by the big words of Dudo. And as for reci procity, surely reciprocity of a certain kind was the essence of the feudal relation. Lord and vassal were each to help and defend the other. No one denies that Henry the Second was the vassal of King Lewis the Seventh, if not for Normandy, at any rate for his other continental possessions, but an equal obligation is imposed, in their mutual oath, on Lewis to defend Henry \" sicut fidelem suuni\" and on Henry to defend Lewis \"dominum siium.\" See Roger of Wendover, ii. 388. y The notion of the independence of_ Normandy on France comes out very strongly in the speech which Henry of Huntingdon puts *\u00bb into the mouth of William the Conqueror before the Battle of Senlac (M. H. B. 762 D). A much later instance will be found in William of Worcester's Collections (Stevenson's Wars in Fiance, ii. 522), when the relations between Normandy and France had again begun to interest Englishmen. We there read of \" Normandy, which ducdom, as yt ys sayde by auncyent wrytyng, holdeth of noone higher souverayn in chief but of God.\" The exact relations between Richard the Fearless and the two \u2014 if any one cares to reckon the last Lewis, the three \u2014 last Karlings I must be content to leave doubtful. When the Duke of the French \u2014 the undoubted over-lord of Normandy \u2014 became also King of the French the question ceased to be a practical one. As I have said in p. 246, the French King was the lord of the Norman Duke in some character, whether in that of Duke or of King it mattered little. The question was not likely to be stirred again till that change in the relations and mutual feelings between France and Normandy which marked the days of King Henry and Duke William."], [672, "624 APPENDIX. NOTE X. p. 180. Danish Marriages. The \" mos Danicus\" with regard to marriage or concubinage, or rather with regard to some third state between marriage and concubinage, is often mentioned in the Norman history of the time. And, though I do not remember the exact words being used in England, yet something of the same kind seems to have existed there also. The ease with which Earl Uhtred (see p. 329) parts with two successive wives, the relations between Cnut and his two \u00c6lfgifus (see p. 411), perhaps the relation between Harold the son of Godwine and the East-Anglian Eadgyth Swanneshals (see vol. iii. Appendix NN), all seem to point to a practice of the same kind. Indeed we shall find (see below, Note SS) that it is by no means clear whether the first wife of \u00c6thelred, the mother of his heroic son, was not in the same way cast aside to make room for the Norman Lady. Instances of the same sort might indeed be found very much later in German, in French, and in English history, and we find a relation essentially the same as far as we can go back in the history of the Aryan race. The \"mos Danicus\" might just as well be called \"mos Achaicus;\" the relation between Rolf and Popa at once reminds one of the relation of Briseis to Achilleus, or of Andromache to Neoptolemos. Briseis is a captive ; but she receives the honourable appellation of aXo^oj (II. ix. 336, 340) ; she has hopes of becoming even Kovpiilrj aXoxos (II. xix. 298). Still Achilleus' relation to her in no way hinders him from taking another wife (H. ix. 394), any more than it hinders Diomede (ib. 661) from taking her place during her constrained absence. In just the same way, Popa is put away to make room for King Charles's daughter; but afterwards we read (Will. Gem. ii. 22), \" Repudiatam Popam .... iterum repetens sibi copulavit.\" (See more in detail, Benoit, v. 7954, and Roman de Rou, 2037.) The \"mos Danicus\" is opposed to the \"mos Christianus.\" The tardy bridal of Richard and Gunnor (see p. 253) was done Christian fashion; \" Virginem [viraginem?] . . . sibi in matrimonium Christiano more desponsavit. \" So says William of Jumieges (iv. 18), and he even thinks it necessary to guarantee (v. 5) that the marriage of Alan of Britanny and"], [673, "DANISH MARRIAGES. 625 Hadwisa the daughter of Richard the Good was celebrated \" Christiano more.\" The expressions used with regard to Sprota herself are many and various. She is in Dudo, 97 A, \"conjux dilectissima ;\" in no D, \" matrona venerabilis,\" a description which, I need hardly say, proves nothing as to her age. In Flodoard, A. 943, her son is \"natus de concubina Britanna.\" King Lewis, if we may believe William of Jumieges (iv. 3), went a step further, and called young Richard \" meretricis filium ultro virum alienum rapientis.\" This is mere Billingsgate, as Richard was certainly born before William's marriage with Liudgardis, though from the Roman de Rou (v. 2073, 2251) one might be led to think otherwise. Elsewhere (iii. 2), in announcing the birth of Richard, William calls her \" nobilissima puella, Danico more sibi [William Longsword] juncta, nomine Sprota.\" And so Benoit, 8872; \"Icele ama mult e tint chere; La vout aveir, non autrement, Mais a la Danesche manere Ce dit l'estorie qui ne ment.\" The last line is most likely meant as a compliment to William of Jumieges. The essence of this kind of connexion seems to be that the woman is the man's wife but that the man is not the woman's husband. He can evidently leave her at pleasure, but there is no recorded instance of her leaving him. This difference may however be simply the result of the difference of rank between the parties in all the cases with which we have to deal. The wife or mistress of a prince is obviously less likely to forsake him than he is to forsake her. And from a modern Scandinavian writer I gather that Scandinavian manners, at a somewhat later time, allowed of a connexion of nearly the same kind, but one which put the sexes more on a level. \" The term fylgikona (literally companion-woman), which fre quently occurs in the Sagas, must have originally meant the same as frilla. Later on, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it received a more honourable import, as it was applied to a free woman living with a man in connubial intercourse according to the terms of a formal contract, but without the observance of the usual wedding ceremonies, and especially without consecration by the Church. Connexions of this kind seem to have been rather common, especially in Iceland, and dated from the time when vol. 1. s s"], [674, "APPENDIX. 626 the Church began to lay greater hindrances in the way of obtaining a divorce than had formerly been the case. This connexion would be dissolved at the wish of either of the parties, or in accordance with the terms which had been previously agreed upon, without the intervention of the Church, a result which was not in accordance with Christian views, and could not be applied to marriages proper. . . . The fglgikona frequently occupied the posi tion of house-wife.\" Keyser's Private Life of the Old Northmen, PP- 35. 36. As for earlier Frankish laxity, among many strange examples I choose the strangest. \" Luxuri\u00e6 supra modum deditus [Dago bertus] tres habebat ad instar Salomonis reginas, maxime et plurimas concubinas. Regiu\u00e6 vero h\u00e6 erant, Nantechildis, Wlfegundis, et Berchildis. Nomina concubinarum, eo quod plures fuissent, increvit huic chronic\u00e6 insert.\" Fredegar, c. 60. NOTE Y. p. 197. The Election of Lewis. We have two main accounts of the election of Lewis. Flodoard (A. 936) tells the tale very briefly; Richer (ii. 1-4), as usual, is much fuller. But the longer version only expands, and in no way contradicts, the shorter one. The main points, that Hugh the Great was the chief mover in the business and that application had to be made to King \u00c6thelstan in England, come out equally in both accounts. Flodoard tells us, in his dry annalistic way, \" Hugo comes trans mare mittit pro accersiendo ad apicem regni suscipiendum Ludowico Karoli filio, quem rex Alstanus avunculus ipsius, accepto prius jurejurando a Francorum legatis, in Franciam cum quibusdam episcopis et aliis fidelibus suis dirigit.\" We may here note how completely the words \" trans mare\" had got to mean England and nothing else, and also that Francia seems to be used in a wider sense than usual (see above, p. 614), though not necessarily in a sense taking in the whole of the Western kingdom. Lewis is met at Boulogne by Hugh and the other princes (\" c\u00e6teri Francorum proceres\"), who do homage to him on the sea-shore (\" in ipsis litoreis areiiis apud Bononiam sese committunt, ut erat utrimque depactum \"). He then goes to Laon, and is crowned."], [675, "THE ELECTION OF LEWIS. 627 Richer (ii. i) first gives us that geographical distribution of parties which I have mentioned in the text, and of which I have also spoken in an earlier Note (see above, p. 609). He distinctly mentions Hugh's unwillingness to assume the crown; \"Quum Hugo patrem ob insolentiam periisse reminiscebatur, et ob hoc regnare formidaret\" (cf. c. 73, where King Lewis says the same), and adds that, through the absence of Lewis and the unwillingness of Hugh, the choice of a King at least seemed freer than usual (\"Galli itaque in regis promotione liberiores videri laborantes\"). They meet under the presidency of Duke Hugh (\" sub Hugone duce deliberaturi de rege creando collecti sunt\"). The Duke makes a speech, which we may safely set down as the composition of the historian. Hugh, we cannot doubt, really had a superstitious feeling against taking the title of King, but he is not likely to have made the strong legitimist harangue which is put into his mouth by Richer. He deplores the sin of his father in reigning, even though he had been chosen to reign by the common voice of the nation ; \" Pater meus vestra quondam omnium voluntate rex creatus, non sine magno regnavit facinore, quum is cui soli jura regnandi debebantur viveret, et vivens carcere clauderetur. Quod credite Deo non acceptum fuisse. Unde et absit ut ego patris loco restituar.\" He then goes on to speak of the reign of Rudolf as teaching the same lesson (\"quum ejus tempore visum sit, quid nunc innasci possit, contemptus videlicet regis ac per hoc principum dissensus\"). He therefore counsels a return to the lawful royal stock (\"repetatur ergo interrupta paullulum regi\u00e6 generationis linea\"). The rest agree, and the embassy is sent to England in the name of the Duke and the other princes (\" Ducis benevolentia atque omnium qui in Galliis potiores sunt\"). The real importance of this speech, like that of many other speeches, consists in its setting forth the feelings of Richer, not the feelings of Duke Hugh. It points to a strong royalist tone as prevailing at Rheims when this part of Richer's history was written, and it is curious to contrast his language now with the language which he uses after the revolution of 987. See p. 240. William of Normandy is not mentioned in either of these accounts. Dudo (97 D) has quite another story, in which, as I hinted in the text, the first step is taken by \u00c6thelstan, who prays Duke William to restore his nephew. \" Audiens autem Alstemus, S S 2"], [676, "APPENDIX. 628 rex Anglorum pacificus, quod pr\u00e6cellebat Willelmus virtute et potentia Francisc\u00e6 nationis omnibus, misit ad eum legatos suos cum donis pr\u00e6maximis et muneribus, deprecans ut Ludovicum nepotem suum, Karoli capti regis morte jam in captione pr\u00e6oc cupati filium, revocaret ad Franci\u00e6 regnum,\" &c., &c. It is in recording this election of Lewis that Rudolf Glaber (i. 3) uses those expressions, so well setting forth the union of election and hereditary right, which I have quoted elsewhere (see above, p. 609). He does not mention Hugh at all, though he had just before enlarged on his share in the election of Rudolf. NOTE Z. p. 205. The Death of William Longsword. Our accounts of the circumstances which led to the death of William Longsword differ widely from each other. Flodoard (943) simply tells us that Arnulf invited him to a conference, and there caused him to be put to death. \"Arnulfus comes Willelmum Nortmannorum principem ad colloquium evocatum dolo perimi fecit.\" Thus much we may accept as certain ; but the oldest French and Norman versions of the events immediately going before are remarkably unlike, and in later writers we find quite another version of the whole affair. Richer (ii. 30 et seqq.) connects the murder of William with an insult offered by him to King Otto in the Council held by Otto and Lewis at Attigny. William, whether by accident or by design, was not admitted at the beginning of the meeting. After waiting for seme time, he forced his way in in great wrath, and his in dignation was further heightened at what he then saw. The two Kings were sitting on a raised couch, the Eastern King, the truer successor of Charles, taking the seat of honour. Below them, on two chairs, sat Hugh the Great and Arnulf. William had lately renewed his homage to Lewis, and was filled with zeal for the honour of his over-lord. He bade Lewis rise, and he himself took his seat immediately below Otto. It was not fit that the Western King should allow any man to sit above him (\"ipse resedit, dixitque indecens esse regem inferiorem, alium"], [677, "THE DEATH OF WILLIAM LONGSWORD. 629 vero quemlibet superiorem videri \"). He then made Otto rise, and made Lewis take the seat left empty by Otto, he himself keeping the place immediately below Lewis, that where Lewis himself had been seated at first ; \" Quapropter oportere Ottonem inde amoliri, regique cedere. Otto pudore affectus surgit ac regi cedit. Rex itaque superior, at Wilelmus inferior consederunt,\" William thus set forth his theory of precedence ; the King of the West-Franks first, the Duke of the Normans second, the Teutonic King and the other princes of Gaul seemingly nowhere. Such a doctrine was naturally unacceptable alike to Otto, Hugh, and Arnulf. They dissembled their anger at the time; but, when the council had broken up, and when Lewis and William had gone away together, they met and discussed their wrongs privately. Otto in vague terms (c. 31) exhorted Hugh and Arnulf to vengeance against William ; he who had not spared him, King Otto, would certainly not spare them (\"qui sibi regi non indulsit, minus illis indul turum\"). Richer however does not charge Otto with counselling the assassination of William, unless such a charge is implied in the words, \" conceptum facinus variis verborum coloribus obvelat.\" Hup-h and Arnulf then met together and determined on the murder of William. His death was expedient, because it would enable them to get Lewis altogether into their power, whereas now William supported the King against them (\" regem etiam ad quodcumque volent facilius inflexuros, si is solum pereat, quo rex fretus ad qu\u00e6que flecti nequeat.\" c. 32). The plot was laid; Arnulf invited William to the conference at Picquigny ; the Norman Duke was there killed by some of the conspirators whose names are not given, but not in the presence or by the avowed orders of the Count of Flanders. Dudo's story (pp. 104 et seqq.) is quite different. He knows nothing of the Council of Attigny, nothing of King Otto as having even an involuntary share in William's murder. With him the first deviser of the scheme is Arnulf, to whom all mischief is as naturally attributed at this stage of Norman history as, at a later stage of English history, it is attributed first to \u00c6lfric and then to Eadric. Arnulf s quarrel with William arises wholly out of the affair of Herlwin of Montreuil (see p. 201). But certain French princes who are not named join with Arnulf in the conspiracy; \" Arnulfus dux Flandrensium supra memoratus, veneno"], [678, "APPENDIX. 630 vipere\u00e6 calliditatis nequiter repletus astuque diabolic\u00e6 fraudis exitialiter illectus, gentisque Francisc\u00e6 quorumdam principum subdolo consilio et malignitate atrociter exhortatus, c\u0153pit meditari et tractare lugubrem mortem ejus Willelmi.\" From this point the two tales are nearly the same ; only Dudo of course throws Arnulf's talk with William into a characteristic Dudonian shape. Arnulf is not only ready to make up his differences with Herlwin; he asks for William's protection against King Lewis, Duke Hugh, and Count Herbert ; he is ready to become William's vassal during life, and to make him his successor at his death; \" Quamdiu superstes fuero ero tibi tributarius, meique servient tibi ut domino servus. Post me\u00e6 resolutionis excessum, possidebis me\u00e6 ditionis regnum\" (105 A). No one but Dudo could have thought of putting such words into Amulf s mouth, even by way of a blind. The assassination itself is described in much the same way as it is by Richer; Dudo also gives us the names of the actual murderers. They are Eric, Balzo, Robert, and Ridulf or Riulf. Now these two versions, though at first sight so utterly different, do not formally contradict one another. It is quite possible that Arnulf may have been led to his crime by a combination of causes, of which Richer has enlarged on one part and Dudo on another, according to their several points of view. Arnulf may well have had a grudge against William, both on account of the wrong done to him in the matter of Montreuil and also on account of the insult offered to him at Attigny. And in fact the two narratives to a certain degree incidentally coincide. Richer (ii. 31) implies that Arnulf and his confederates already had a grudge against William before the meeting at Attigny ; \" Qu\u00e6 oratio [Ottonis sc] pluri mam invidiam paravit, ac amicos in odium Wilelmi incitavit, quum et ipsi, quamvis latenter, ei admodum inviderent.\" Dudo, as we have seen, speaks of a conspiracy of Arnulf with other princes of Gaul. It was not at all unnatural that the affair of Attigny should be of primary importance in the eyes of Richer, and that the affair of Montreuil should be of primary importance in the eyes of Dudo. Attigny lay quite beyond the reach of ordinary Norman vision, and William's doings there might not seem very meritorious in Norman eyes. It was certainly some thing to have put an open affront upon the Eastern King; but"], [679, "THE DEATH OF WILLIAM LONGSWORD. 631 it was perhaps hardly becoming in the independent lord of the Norman monarchy (see page 221, and above, p. 621) to show such ostentatious deference to the Western King. It is therefore quite possible to put together a very probable narrative, taking in the main statements both of Richer and of Dudo, but of course allowing for the rhetorical and exaggerated form into which both of them throw their details. This is very much what is done by Sir Francis Palgrave (Normandy and England, ii. 299 et seqq.), only in one or two places he gives the story a strange colouring of his own. I can find nothing about William being himself too late, either on purpose or by accident. The statement of Richer, as I read it, is simply that, whether by design or by accident, he was shut out of the council-chamber. Again, Sir Francis simply says that William \" compelled King Otho to rise ; \" he says not a word about William's motive for so doing or about the exaggerated loyalty which he displayed towards Lewis. One can hardly doubt, on the authority of Flodoard and Richer, that William was really killed at Picquigny by the machinations of Arnulf. But there is quite another story, briefly alluded to by Sir Francis Palgrave in two places (pp. 298, 303), which transfers the scene of the murder from the Somme to the Seine. This version turns up in several shapes. We get it in Rudolf Glaber (iii. 9. Duchesne, vol. iv. p. 38), according to whom the chief criminal was Theobald of Chartres. Theobald the Tricker is the first to devise the plot, and he is also the actual murderer. In concert with Arnulf, William is invited by Theobald to a con ference somewhere on the Seine. Rudolf is not clear whether the summons was sent in the name of the King or of the Duke of the French (\" promittens se ex parte regis Francorum seu Hugonis Magni, qui fuerat filius Roberti regis, quern Otto dux Saxonum, postea vero Imperator Romanorum, Suessionis inters ecit \") ; that is to say, Rudolf already failed to understand that there had been a time when the Rex Francorum was quite a different person from the lord of Paris and the Seine. The story of the murder then follows much as before, with the Seine for the Somme and Theobald for Arnulf; only Theobald kills William with his own hand. In the Tours Chronicle (Duchesne, Rer. Franc, iii. 360) we find another version; \" Guillelmus filius Rollonis ducis Normanni\u00e6 a"], [680, "APPENDIX. 632 Balzone Curto in medio Sequan\u00e6 occisus est, propter mortem Riulfi et filii sui Anchetilli.\" Now we found Balzo in Dudo's account as the name of one of William's murderers, but we had no account of the man or of his motives. He here appears as the avenger of Riulf, doubtless the Riulf who headed the revolt against William in 932 (see p. 189). We then however heard nothing of Riulf's death, the statement of Dudo (96 D) being that \" Riulfus fugiendo evanuit.\" But who is Anchetillus, Anquetil, Anscytel, a palpable Dane like our own Thurcytels and Ulfcytels ? And why should Balzo avenge either Ancytel or Riulf? Here comes in the story of William of Malmesbury, which he first tells (ii. 145) as if he fully believed it, and then adds, as more trustworthy (\" vera ciores liter\u00e6 dicunt \"), an abridgement of Dudo's story. Anscytel (Oscytel) is the son of Riulf, a Norman chief who had somehow incurred William Longsword's displeasure, and who greatly troubled him with his revolts. But Anscytel is the faithful soldier of Duke William, and he carries his loyalty so far as to take his father prisoner and to hand him over to the Duke. He does however exact a promise that Riulf shall suffer no punishment worse than bonds. But, not long after, Anscytel is sent by Duke William to Pavia with a letter for a potentate described as the Duke of Italy, asking that the bearer may be put to death (\" Comes Anschetillum in Papiam dirigit, epistolam de sua ipsius nece ad ducem Itali\u00e6 portantem \"). This, I need hardly say, is a story as old as Bellerophontes (H. vi. 168) and as modern as Godwine (see Note EEE). The Duke of Italy of course abhors the crime, and, equally of course, is in dread of the power of his brother of Normandy. A thousand horsemen are sent to attack Anscytel and his companions as soon as they are out of the city. Anscytel, like the Homeric Tydeus, was small in stature but valiant in war (\" vir exigui corporis sed immanis fortitudinis \" \u2014 p.iKP6s lrp> Upas, akVa paxnrljs- H. v. 801), whence his surname Curtus. But, less suc cessful than Tydeus (II. iv. 387; v. 803 et seqq.) or Bellerophontes (H. vi. 188), Anscytel and his comrades indeed slay all their enemies, but they are also all slain themselves, except Balzo. This sole survivor, unlike Othryades (Herod, i. 82), does not kill him self, but at once accuses his immediate lord Duke William in the court of his over-lord the King. Besides the treachery practised against Anscytel, Riulf too, contrary to Duke William's promise,"], [681, "LEADING MEN AT THE DEATH OF EADGAR. 633 had been blinded in prison. The Duke of the Normans is summoned by his over-lord to answer for the crime, and, somewhat strangely, the court of the Carolingian King of Laon is held at Paris. Thither Duke William humbly comes, and there he is, like Uhtred (see p. 379) and Eadwulf (see p. 527), killed by Balzo under the pretext of a conference. I need hardly say that this tale, as it stands, is a mere romance ; but it is an instructive romance, because it is so easy to trace out the mythical elements out of which it is made up. Still, like most other such stories, it most likely contains its kernel of truth. Balzo may have been one of Riulf's followers in the Cotentin, who took an opportunity to revenge his chieftain's defeat. More than this it would be rash to infer. So the story in Rudolf Glaber may justify us in adding Theobald of Chartres to the list of conspirators against William, and the same story falls in with the charge against Hugh brought by Richer. But there is no kind of need to breathe the least suspicion against King Lewis ; William was just then his firm friend, and any mention of the King as having a hand in the business seems to be owing only to the fact that the later writers had forgotten what were the true relations between Laon and Paris in the days of William Longsword. NOTE AA. p. 263. Leading Men in England at the Death of Eadgar. \u00c6lfhere of Mercia is called by Florence (983) \"Regis Anglorum Eadgari propinquus,\" which most likely means kindred by the mother's side. His name is affixed to most of the charters of the time, and many acts in Mercia are stated to be done by his consent. See, for instance, a charter of Bishop Oswald (Cod. Dipl. iii. 5), where he bears the title of \" heretoga.\" The Chronicles (A. 975), followed by Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 748 C), who calls him \"consul nequissimus,\" charge him with actually destroying monasteries. Florence speaks only of his bringing in married priests and their wives. In some cases it appears that former owners of lands then in monastic occupation laid legal claims to them as having been taken from them unjustly."], [682, "APPENDIX. 634 See Hist. El. lib. i. c. 5, 8 ; Gale, pp. 465. 4^7- It is curious to find among these claimants against the monastery of Ely no less a person than Ealdorman \u00c6thelwiue himself (Hist. El. lib. i. c. 5). \u00c6thelwine, worshipped at Ramsey, was thought much less highly of at Ely, just as we shall find Harold spoken of very differently at Wells and at Waltham. Of the house of the Ealdormen of the East-Angles, of whom \u00c6thelwine, who has just been mentioned, was the most famous, we can get a still more distinct idea. See Florence, A. 975, 991 ; Hist. Rams. 387, Gale. \u00c6thelwine was the youngest son of \u00c6thelstan, surnamed the Half-king (Hist. Rams., u. s.), Ealdor man of the East-Angles, who seems to have died about 967, when we find his last signature (Cod. Dipl. iii. 16). He married (Hist. El. ii. 8 ; Gale, p. 495) \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, daughter of Brihthelm, and sister of the famous Ealdorman Brihtnoth, of whom we shall hear more presently. They had four sons, \u00c6thelwold, \u00c6lfwold, \u00c6thel sige, and \u00c6thelwiue. Of these, the eldest and youngest were in turn joined with their father in the government of East- Anglia. \u00c6thelwold, whose widow \u00c6lfthryth married King Eadgar in 964 (when Florence calls him \" gloriosus dux Orientalium Anglorum\"), signs several charters as dux down to 962, probably the year of his death. From that year his youngest brother (see Florence, 992) \u00c6thelwine takes his place. It is not easy to see why \u00c6lfwold was excluded, as he lived on in a private station, and was on good terms with his brother the Ealdorman (Fl. Wig. A. 975). \u00c6thelsige also, the third brother, signs many charters with the title of \" minister,\" that is, Thegn. \u00c6thelwine died in 992 (Fl. Wig. 992). The portentous title of \"totius [Orientalis ?] Angli\u00e6 aldermannus,\" said (see Hist. Rams. p. 462) to have been inscribed on his grave, is hardly credible, but it has its parallels in the title of \" Dux Francorum,\" borne by the contemporary Lords of Paris, in that of \" Princeps Francorum\" borne by the Mayors of the Palace in earlier days (Ann. Mett. 621 ; Pertz, i. 320, &c.), and in that of \"Dux Anglorum\" given by the Bayeux Tapestry to Harold when Earl of the West- Saxons. Who succeeded him in his earldom is not very clear. He had a son \u00c6thelweard, who died at Assandun in 1016. Florence calls him \"\u00c6thelwardus dux, filius ducis East- Anglorum \u00c6thelwini Dei amici,\" but the Chronicles call him simply \"\u00c6pelweard \u00c6pelwines sunu ealdormannes.\" The tes-"], [683, "LEADING MEN AT THE DEATH OF EADGAR. 635 timony of Florence shows that \"\u00c6pel wines,\" the reading of the Abingdon Chronicle, is the right one. Worcester has \"\u00c6lfwines,\" Peterborough, more remarkably, \" \u00c6cSelsiges.\" The question as to the right of this \u00c6thelweard to the title of \" dux \" at once leads us to the position of the famous Ulfcytel of East-Anglia, of whom see below, Note HH. With regard to \u00c6thelsige, the question at once arises whether this is the \u00c6thelsige of whom \u00c6thelred speaks in a charter of 999 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 305) as having beguiled him into his spoliation of the see of Rochester. See above, p. 267. This \u00c6thelsige, he complains, corrupted his inno cent youth, and he draws a fearful picture of his evil deeds in various ways. He was at last punished by the loss of all his own honours and property. This is no doubt the \u00c6thelsige who signs many of the earlier charters of \u00c6thelred (Cod. Dipl. iii. 171, 190, 202, 212, 216, 222, 224, 228, 280); but it is not clear either whether this is our \u00c6thelsige, or whether either of them is the same as the captain who ravaged South Wales in 991. Of Brihtnoth, the uncle and ally of \u00c6thelwine, we shall hear again as the hero of Maldon (see p. 270). Of the many ways of spelling his name and kindred names, Brihtric and the like, Briht noth is the one which I prefer. Beorht is the older, briht the later form of the word ; so that Beorhtnoth and Brihtnoth are the correct earlier and later forms of the name. Bgrhtnoth and other spell ings are simply transitional and irregular. Brihtnoth, we learn from the Song of Maldon, was the son of Brihthelm. I take him to be the same as Brihtnoth the Thegn, to whom a grant of land is made by Eadgar in 967 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 15), and who signs as \"minister,\" another man of the same name signinn; as \" dux.\" This elder Ealdorman Brithnoth can be traced back to the beginning of Eadgar's reign. It is not easy to say to which of these two Brihtnoths the signatures of \" Brihtnoth dux\" in the latter years of Eadgar belong. Nor iB it clear which of the two it is to whom Eadgar makes another grant of land in 967 (Cod. Dipl. vi. 82). But it is certain that our Brihtnoth had attained the rank of Ealdorman before the death of Eadgar in 975. In 991 he was an old man, \" Har hilderinc.\" It should be noticed that Brihtnoth the Thegn gives the lands granted him by the King to the church of Worcester, an act eminently characteristic of our Brihtnoth."], [684, "APPENDIX. 636 There is another notice of Brihtnoth in a charter of \u00c6thelred of 1005 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 339), which seems to contain a reference to a genuine will of his. In the confirmation charter of Eynsham abbey the King\u2014\" ego EtSelredus, multiplici Dei dementia indul- gente, Angul-Saxonum antedictus rex, c\u00e6terarumque gentium longe lateque per circuitum gubernator et rector \"\u2014records among other gifts, \" villam qu\u00e6 Scipford dicitur dedit vir pr\u00e6dictus [the founder \u00c6thelmar] ad monasterium antedictum, quam ei Leof- winus suus consanguineus spiritu in ultimo constitutus donavit, quam Birhtno'Sus antea dux pr\u0153clarus ab Eadgaro patre meo dignis pr\u0153mium pro meritis aceipere l\u00e6tabatur; Micclantun similiter ad monasterium dedit, quam ille BirhtnocSus dux pr\u00e6dictus ultimo commisit dono ab Eadgaro quoque ei antea donatam et in cartida frmiter commendatam.\" We here see the favour in which Briht- noth stood with Eadgar. Brihtnoth appears also in the will of \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d (recited in that of \u00c6lfl\u00e6d, Cod. Dipl, iii. 271), a document of the reign of Eadgar. Large bequests are made to the Ealdorman by \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d ; but his death seems to have hindered their taking effect, as a different disposal of the property is made by \u00c6lfl\u00e6d. Mr. Thorpe (Dipl. Ang. 519) identifies this \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d with the widow of King Eadmund, but his reference to the Chronicles should be 946 instead of 925. Brihtnoth had married \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's sister. As his own widow bore the same name, was she a second wife, or were there two sisters both called \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d ? We find another case of three \u00c6thelfl\u00e6ds in one family, p. 521. In the alleged will of Brihtnoth himself in Palgrave, ii. ccxxiii., I put very little faith. The accounts of Brihtnoth in the Histories of Ely and Ramsey seem to be mixed up with a good deal of fable. They both (Ramsey, c. lxxi. ; Gale, p. 422 ; Ely, lib. ii. c. 6 ; Gale, p. 493) tell a story how the Ealdorman, on his march against the Danes, came to Ramsey and asked for food for his army. The niggardly Abbot Wulfsige was ready to entertain the Ealdorman and a few select companions, but he would not undertake to feed the whole host. Brihtnoth, like Alexander, will partake of nothing in which all his soldiers cannot share, and marches on to Ely, where Abbot \u00c6lfsige receives the whole multitude. Brihtnoth accordingly gives to the abbey of Ely certain lands which he had intended for that of Ramsey. This is hardly history; we see too clearly the"], [685, "LEADING MEN AT THE DEATH OF EADGAR. 637 stories of Gideon and the elders of Succoth and of David and Abiathar the Priest. It is also hard to see how a march to Maldon from any part of Brihtnoth's government could lead him by either Ramsey or Ely. The Ely History escapes this difficulty by making him Earl of the Northumbrians instead of the East- Saxons, and by making two battles of Maldon. Brihtnoth, vic torious in the former, returns to Northumberland ; the Danes land again ; Brihtnoth comes from Northumberland, taking the two abbeys on his march ; he then fights the second battle, in which, after fourteen days of combat, he is killed. Of the three Thegns of Lindesey or Deira, who played such a cowardly part in 993 (see p. 283), two at least are known to us by the charters of Eadgar's reign. The account of the affair in the Chronicles is simply, \" pa onstealdon pa heretogan \u00e6rest pone fleam- p\u00e6t w\u00e6s Fr\u00e6na and Godwine and FritSegist.\" Florence expands somewhat ; \" Duces exercitus, Frana videlicet, Frithogist, et Godwinus, quia ex paterno genere Danici fuerunt, suis insi diantes, auctores fug\u00e6 primitus exstiterunt.\" The words \" ex paterno genere \" would imply that the earlier Danish settlers, like the followers of Cnut and of William afterwards, often took English wives. Also Florence translates \" heretogan\" by \" duces exercitus\" lest \" heretogan \" should be taken to imply the per manent rank of Ealdorman. Neither Fr\u00e6na nor Frithegist ever held that rank. They sign charters in abundance, from the days of Eadgar onwards, but never with any higher rank than that of \" minister \" or \" miles.\" Fr\u00e6na signs a great many charters long after this. In 995 he signs two of \u00c6scwig, Bishop of Dorchester (Cod. Dipl. iii. 286, 288), which probably implies that he belonged to Lindesey and not to Deira. Of Godwine we may suspect that he also was of Lindesey, that he reformed, and rose to the rank of Ealdorman. Godwine, Ealdorman of Lindesey, who died at Assandun in 10 16, is most likely the man here spoken of; but Godwine is so common a name that it is impossible to say to whom all the signatures of \"Godwine minister\" belong. Some times two or more Godwines sign without further distinction. These are the chief men of the days of Eadgar who are also heard of under \u00c6thelred, with the exception of those who are connected with Northumberland, of whom I shall speak in a separate Note (KK). It would also be easy, by the help of the"], [686, "638 APPENDIX. charters, to trace the succession and promotions of several men of less renown. NOTE BB. p. 265. The Election of Eadward the Martyr. The Chronicles do not, either in prose or in verse, say anything about the disputed election which is said to have followed the death of Eadgar, though three of them notice in verse that the crown passed to a minor. Eadgar dies, \"And feng his beam sySSan Eorla ealdor To cynerice, pam w\u00e6s Eadweard nama.\" Cild unweaxen. Either there is here a play on the words \" ealdor \" and \" cild unweaxan,\" or else the passage is a sign how utterly the word \" ealdor \" had lost its primitive sense. Florence describes the disputed election very clearly ; \"De rege eligendo magna inter regni primores oborta est dissensio ; quidam namque regis filium Edwardum, quidam vero fratrem illius elegerunt \u00c6gelredum. Quam ob caussam archi pr\u00e6sules Dunstanus et Oswaldus, cum coepiscopis, abbatibus, ducibusque quam plurimis, in unum convenerunt, et Eadwardum, ut pater suus pr\u00e6ceperat, elegerunt ; electum consecraverunt et in regem unxerunt.\" William of Malmesbury (ii. 161) makes Eadward be supported by Dunstan and certain Bishops in opposition to the Lady \u00c6lfthryth and a party of the nobles ; \" contra voluntatem quorumdam, ut aiunt, optimatum et noverc\u00e6, qu\u00e6 vixdurn septem annorum pueru lum Egelredum filium provehere conabatur, ut ipsa potius sub ejus nomine imperitaret.\" Osbern, the biographer of Dunstan (Anglia Sacra, ii. 113), speaks of Eadward as the heir, but says that some of the chief nobles objected to his election (\" in cujus electione dum quidam principes palatini adquiescere nollent \") because of their fears from his supposed character (\" existimantes juvenem regem inhumanuni futurum, consilia sapientum non curaturum, sed pro libidine omnia acturum\"). Eadmer, in his Life of Dunstan (Ang. Sac. ii. 220), makes them dread his severe justice (\" quia morum illius severi-"], [687, "THE TWO \u00c6LFR1CS. 639 tatem, qua in suorum excessus acriter s\u00e6vire consueverat, suspectam habebat \"). They also object that he was not the son of a crowned King and his Lady (\" quia matrem ejus, licet legaliter nuptam, in regnum tamen non magis quam patrem ejus dum eum genuit sacratam fuisse sciebant\"). Waitz (iii. 65) remarks, when Pope Stephen anointed the sons of Pippin along with their father, \" dass dies geschehen sei, um den vor der Wahl gebornen Sbhnen das voile Erbrecht zu geben und die Moglichkeit zu entfer nen, dass man etwa spater gebornen Scihnen einen Vorrang beilege.\" In both these accounts the matter is brought to an issue by the vigorous action of Dunstan. One would like to know how far there is any truth in these state ments of the objections brought against Eadward. One would have thought that there could not have been much to fear from either the virtues or the vices of a boy of his years. But the objection brought against him on the ground of his not being of kingly birth is much more likely to be a piece of genuine tradition. The difficulty about it is that, as Lappenberg remarks, it was an objection which told just as much against \u00c6thelred as against Eadward. For the meaning can hardly be other than that Eadward was born before his father's coronation at Bath in 974, which \u00c6thelred was also. Otherwise the objection would really be a good one, and it was used long after on behalf of Henry the First against his elder brothers. (Cf. Herod, vii. 2-3.) Perhaps all that was meant was to deny that Eadward had any preference over his half-brother, so that the two boys might be candidates on equal terms. I may add that the Bath coronation of Eadgar is to me one of the most puzzling things in our history. I should have taken it to be, according to one story, a mere taking again of the crown after the penance for the matter of Wulfthryth ; only the Chronicles, which have hitherto freely called Eadgar King, in recording the corona tion pointedly call him \u00c6theling. NOTE CC p. 278 The Two \u00c6lfrics Who was \u00c6lfric, and how many \u00c6lfrics were there ? An \u00c6lfric, son of \u00c6lfhere of Mercia, had, as we have seen, succeeded his father"], [688, "640 APPENDIX. in the government of that country, and had been banished five years before (see p. 268) the time which we have reached. An Ealdorman \u00c6lfric died fighting for his country twenty-five years later (seep. 293). Most likely these are three distinct persons; but, as the \u00c6lfric of whom we are now speaking was pardoned after crimes which might seem unpardonable, he might easily be thought to be the same as the already banished son of \u00c6lfhere. At the same time it should be noticed that Florence in no way identifies the \u00c6lfric of 991 with the banished \u00c6lfric of 986, while he takes great pains to show that the \u00c6lfric of 991 is the same as the traitor of 992 (\"Alfricum cujus supra meminimus \") and of 1003 (\" Alfricus dux supra memoratus\"). The charters also seem to show that \u00c6lfric the son of \u00c6lfhere and the \u00c6lfric of 991 are two distinct persons. In 983 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 196) we have the signatures of \"\u00c6lfhere dux,\" \"\u00c6lfric dux.\" In another charter of the same year we find these two signatures and also those of two persons called \"\u00c6lfric minister.\" In 984 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 202) we find two signatures of \" \u00c6lfric dux \" and one of \" \u00c6lfric minister.\" In 984 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 203) we find \"\u00c6lfric ealdor- man \" addressed along with \" ealle pa pegenas on Hamtunscire.\" A mention of Bishop \u00c6lfheah in the charter shows that this means Hampshire and not Northamptonshire, and \u00c6lfric the traitor seems to command the men of Hampshire in 1003 (see p. 318). In Cod. Dipl. iii. 292 we have mention of an \"\u00c6lfric ealdorman\" who seems to have jurisdiction in Berkshire; his government may easily have taken in the two adjoining shires. I infer, then, that \u00c6lfric the traitor was not Ealdorman of the Mercians, but of Hampshire and Berkshire, and that he was appointed in or before 983, when we find his signature along with that of \u00c6lfhere. \u00c6lfric the son of \u00c6lfhere succeeded his father in Mercia in 983 ; in 984 there fore there were two Ealdormen of the name, and we find the signatures of both. Another argument to the same effect is supplied by two charters which evidently refer to the banishment of \u00c6lfric the son of \u00c6lfhere. One in Cod. Dipl. vi. 174, attributed to the year 993, granting certain lands to the monastery of Abingdon, says, \" Has ten-arum portiones Alfric cognomento puer a quadam vidua Eadfled appellata violenter abstraxit, ac deinde quum in ducatu suo contra me et contra omnem gentem meam reus exsisteret .... quando ad"], [689, "THE TREATY WITH OLAF AND JUSTIN. 641 synodale concilium ad Cyrneceastre universi optimates mei simul in unum convenerant, et eumdem Alfricum majestatis reum de hac patria profugum expulerunt.\" The other charter, of 999 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 312, Hist. Abingdon. i. 373), states much the same of a person described as \" comes vocitamine \u00c6lfric.\" This charter is signed by an \" \u00c6lfric dux,\" that is, no doubt, \u00c6lfric of Hampshire. \" Alfricus cyld,\" that is, of course, \" cognomento puer,\" is spoken of also in the Ely History (i. 12, Gale) as a man of importance, as the son of Ealdorman \u00c6lfhere would be, before \u00c6thelred was King (969-979). The description of the Witenagemot at Cirencester reads very like the banishment in 986. As for the hero of Assandun, I can only say that the name \u00c6lfric is exceedingly common, and that it is open to us to identify him with any of the men who sign as \"\u00c6lfric minister.\" I am thankful that I have only to deal with the lay \u00c6lfrics. There is an ecclesiastical difficulty of the same kind which I cheerfully leave in the hands of Professor Stubbs. NOTE DD. p. 279. The Treaty with Olaf and Justin. The text of the Treaty is given in Thorpe, i. 284 ; Schmid, 204. It is drawn up between King \u00c6thelred and his Witan on the one side and the invading army on the other. \" pis synd pa fritS-mal and pa, forword, pe \u00c6tSelred cyng and ealle his witan wiS pone here gedon habbaft, pe Anlaf and Justin and GutSmund Stegitan sunu mid w\u00e6ron.\" It must belong to this year, and, if so, it seems to prove that Olaf Tryggvesson was present, and also that he was not yet either King or catechumen. Had the docu ment belonged to the later dealings with Olaf, he would hardly have been placed alongside with Justin and Guthmund, but some notice would have been taken both of his Christianity and of his royal rank. Compare the different language of the treaties of \u00c6lfred with the first and of Eadward with the second Guthrum, Thorpe, i. 152, 166; Schmid, 106, 118. The treaty between \u00c6lfred and Guthrum is drawn up between \" \u00c6lfred cynincg and VOL. I. T t"], [690, "APPENDIX. 642 GycSram cyning and ealles Angeleynnes witan and eal se6 peod pe on East-En\"lum beotS.\" That between Eadward and the second Guthrum is between \" Eadward cyng and GuoYum cyng,\" and the Christianity of both sides is distinctly set forth. Schmid (p. li.) supposes, either that the Anlaf here spoken of was another person from Olaf Tryggvesson, or else that the name Anlaf is an inter polation in the text. But surely these suppositions are rather violent, when the matter can be explained without recourse to them. By this treaty provision is made for wergilds, for the reception of merchants, and for various civil contingencies, which clearly imply that a long stay was expected on the part of the Northmen. Neither side is to receive the other's thieves, foes, or Welshmen (Schmid, 208). \"And p\u00e6t natSor ne hy ne we underfon otfres Wealh ne ooYes peof ne oSres gefan.\" The Wealas of the North men must have been simply their prisoners or servants of any kind, many of them perhaps Englishmen. So completely had the word shared the fate of the word Slave, as is still more plainly the case with the feminine form Wylne. On the use of the word Englaland in the treaty, see above, P- 538- NOTE EE. pp. 285, 302. The Relations of \u00c6thelred with Normandy. The English Chronicles, and also Florence, are silent as to any intercom se, whether friendly or hostile, between England and Normandy earlier than the marriage of \u00c6thelred and Emma. The one passage which has been sometimes thought to refer to one of the events recorded in the text cannot possibly have that meaning. The entry in the Chronicles in the year 1000, \"And se unfriS flota w\u00e6s S\u00e6s sumeres gewend to Ricardes rice,\" can refer only to the Danish fleet. \" UnfriS flota \" must be taken in the same sense as \" unfriS here\" in the year 1009. And so it is taken by Florence ; \" Danorum classis pr\u00e6fata hoc anno Nortmanniam petit.\" We are thus left wholly to the testimony of inferior authorities, and we must get such an amount of truth out of them as we can."], [691, "THE RELATIONS OF \u00c6THELRED WITH NORMANDY. 643 I have, in my text, after some hesitation, described two disputes between \u00c6thelred and the Norman Dukes. The first quarrel was with Richard the Fearless in 991, which was appeased by the intervention of Pope John the Fifteenth; the second was with Richard the Good in iooo, which led to open hostilities which are described as an English invasion of the Cotentin. The stories rest respectively on the authority of William of Malmesbury (ii. 165, 6), and of William of Jumieges (v. 4). It is open to any one to reject both stories. It is still more open to any one to reject the second story, the exaggerated character of which is manifest, and the chronology of which must be a year or two wrong. But I do not think that it is safe to take them, with Sir Francis Palgrave (England and Normandy, iii. 103), and Dr. Lappenberg (p. 421 of the original, ii. 154 Thorpe), as different versions of one event, still less to fix, with Sir Francis, that event to the later date of the two. William of Malmesbury tells us very little in his own name. He says only that Richard the Fearless had provoked \u00c6thelred in various ways (\"vir eximius, qui etiam Edelredum s\u00e6pe injuriis pulsaverit\"), and that Pope John, wishing to hinder war among Christians (\"non passa sedes apostolica duos Christianos digladiari\"), sent Leo Bishop of Trier into England to make peace. A docu- ment then follows, described as the \" legationis epistola\" of this prelate, which contains an account of his mission, and gives the terms of the peace between \u00c6thelred and Richard, and the names of the plenipotentiaries on both sides. The document is very strange in point of form, as it begins in the name of the Pope, while the latter part clearly gives the actual words of the treaty. Sir Francis Palgrave (iii. 106) objects to the genuineness of the letter that its style is unusual, if not unparalleled, which it certainly is. It runs thus; \"Johannes quintus decimus, sanct\u00e6 Roman\u00e6 ecdesi\u00e6 Papa, omnibus fidelibus.\" Sir Francis does not mention another objection, namely, that neither in 991 nor in 1001 was the Archbishop of Trier named Leo. The reigning Archbishop in 991 was Eckebert; before iooo he had been succeeded by Ludolf (Gesta Treverorum, ap. Pertz, viii. 1 69-1 71). But Sir Francis (iii. 107) adds, \"While we reject the convention in the shape now presented, we accept its import. \u2014 The quarrel and the reconciliation are unquestionable verities.\" But the quarrel and T t 2"], [692, "APPENDIX. 644 reconciliation recorded by William of Malmesbury are a quarrel and reconciliation between \u00c6thelred and Richard the Fearless in a definite year 991. They cannot be turned into a quarrel and reconciliation between \u00c6thelred and Richard the Good nine years later. The apparently wrong name of the papal legate is a difficulty either way, but it is not a very formidable one. Lappenberg (p. 422 of the original German) calls Leo \" Picebischof von Trier,\" which Mr. Thorpe (ii. 154) translates simply \"Bishop.\" Lappenberg gives no reference for his description of Leo ; but a fact in German history may be safely accepted on his authority, and the local history of Trier which I have just referred to contains a statement which curiously fits in with our story. Archbishop Eckebert (977-993), son of Theodoric, Count of Holland, was the son of an English mother, and he kept up a close connexion with England. It is therefore quite natural that either he or an officer of his church should enter with zeal into a scheme for the advantage of a country which Eckebert seems almost to have looked on as his own. The other names are accurately given. John the Fifteenth was Pope, and \u00c6thelsige was Bishop of Sherborne, in 991. Both were dead in 1000. I think it follows that the account in William of Malmesbury cannot possibly refer to a transaction with Richard the Good in 1000. The story is definitely fixed to the year 991. Is then William of Malmesbury's account ground enough for accepting a quarrel between \u00c6thelred and Richard the Fearless, and a reconciliation brought about by Pope John Fifteenth ? On the whole, I think it is. It is not the kind of transaction which any one would invent, if nothing of the sort happened at all, and it is hard to see to what other transaction the account can refer. The story also, as it seems to me, fits in well with the circumstances of the times. The \" legationis epistola\" can hardly be genuine in its actual shape as a letter of the Pope, but it seems to be made out of two genuine documents, a letter of Pope John and the text of the treaty. The unusual style might be simply the bungling attempt of a compiler to show which of all the Popes named John was the one here meant. The treaty itself bears every sign of genuineness, and the names of the plenipotentiaries are distinctly in its favour. One of the Norman signatures is that of \" Rogerus episcopus,\" and there was a Roger Bishop of Lisieux"], [693, "THE RELATIONS OF \u00c6THELRED WITH NORMANDY. 645 from 990 to 1024. The lesser Norman plenipotentiaries I cannot identify, but on the English side, as the Bishop is right, the Thegus also are right. A mere forger would not have inserted such names as those of Leofstan and \u00c6thelnoth. He would either have put in names quite at a venture, or else have picked out the names of some famous Ealdormen of the time. There could be no temptation for a forger to pitch on Leofstan and \u00c6thelnoth, real contemporary men, but men of no special celebrity. The reader has still to determine whether, accepting this account of \u00c6thelred's quarrel with the elder Richard, he will go on to admit a second quarrel with the younger Richard. The only question is whether the story in William of Jumieges is pure invention, or whether its manifestly exaggerated details contain some such kernel of truth as I have supposed in the text. It certainly seems to me that to set the whole affair down as a mere lie is attributing too much even to the Norman power of lying, which I certainly have no wish to underrate. The story, in its general outline, seems to fit in well with the position of things at the time, and even with the character of \u00c6thelred. But if we accept it as thus far true, we must suppose that William of Jumieges transposed the invasion of the Cotentin and the marriage of Emma. He places the latter event first. Now the marriage would follow very naturally on the conclusion of peace, while the invasion would not be at all likely to follow the marriage. Sir Francis Palgrave silently transposes the two events in the same way that I have done. He also connects the invasion, as I have done, with the reception of Danish vessels in the Norman havens. If this was, as I suppose, a breach of the treaty of 991, the wrath of \u00c6thelred becomes still more intelligible. In this view of the matter, looking at the entry in the Chronicles under the year iooo, we can hardly fail to fix the event in that year. Lappenberg, whose note (p. 422) should be read in the original text, takes the opposite view to Sir Francis Palgrave. He accepts the account of the transaction in 991, but carries back the invasion of the Cotentin to that year. This is at least more probable than Sir Francis' version, and perhaps some readers may be inclined to accept it rather than my notion of two distinct disputes. But the narrative of William of Jumieges connects the"], [694, "APPENDIX. 646 invasion in a marked way with the marriage of Emma, though he has clearly confounded the order of events. Roger of Wendover (i. 427) boldly carries back the marriage of Emma to some date earlier than 990, and makes the quarrel between \u00c6thelred and her father arise out of his ill-treatment of her. He was misled by William of Malmesbury's characteristic contempt for chronological order. NOTE FF. p. 300. \u00c6thelred's Invasion of Cumberland. The Chronicles, followed by Florence, state the fact of \u00c6thel red's expedition against Cumberland without any explanation of its motives ; \" Her on pisum geare se cyning ferde in to Cumer lande, and hit switSe neah eall forheregode.\" So Florence ; \" Rex \u00c6gelredus terram Cumbrorum fere totam depopulatus est.\" For the motive of this unusual piece of energy we have, in default of any better authority, to go to Fordun, iv. 35 (vol. i. p. 179 ed. Skene). He attributes it to Malcolm's refusal to contribute to the Danegeld. Having spoken of several of the payments made to the Danes, he thus goes on ; \"Unde rex Ethelredus regulo Cumbri\u00e6 supradicto Malcolmo scribens per nuntium mandavit quod suos Cumbrenses tributa solvere cogeret, sicut c\u00e6teri faciunt provinciales. Quod ille protinus contradicens rescripsit suos aliud nullatenus debere vectigal, pr\u00e6terquam ad edictum regium, quandocumque sibi placuerit, cum c\u00e6teris semper fore paratos ad bellandum Hac caussa quidem, et sicut rex in ira motus asseruit, eo quod regulus contra saoramentum sibi debitum Danis favebat, maximam ex Cumbria pr\u00e6dam arripuit. Postea tamen Concordes per omnia statim effecti, pace firma de c\u00e6tero convenerant.\" This account seems so likely in itself that I have not scrupled to adopt it in the text But it must be compared with an account given by Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 750 A), which at first sight sounds very different ; \" Exinde rex Edelred ivit in Cumber land cum exercitu gravissimo, ubi maxima mansio Dacorum erat, vicitque Dacos hello maximo, totamque fere Cumberland pr\u00e6dando"], [695, "\u00c6THELRED'S INVASION OF CUMBERLAND. 647 vastavit.\" Here is no mention of Malcolm, and the Danes are described as being actually in possession of the country, of which the other accounts give us no hint. But that Malcolm was reigning in Cumberland at this time there is no doubt, and if any Danes were settled there, they must have been settled by Malcolm's consent, willing or constrained. It is of course possible that one ground of \u00c6thelred's wrath against Malcolm may have been that he had not only refused to pay Danegeld, but had allowed Danes to settle in his dominions. And it may be that we may here have lighted on the clew to the great puzzle of Cumbrian ethnology. That Cumberland and Westmoreland are to this day largely Scandinavian needs no proof. But we have no record of the process by which they became so. In Northumberland and East- Anglia we know when the Danes settled, and we know something of the dynasties which they founded. But the Scandinavian settlement in Cumberland \u2014 Norwegian no doubt rather than Danish \u2014 we know only by its results. We have no statement as to its date, and we know that no Scandinavian dynasty was founded there. The settlement must therefore have been more peaceful and more gradual than the settlements in Northumberland and East-Anglia, and the reign of Malcolm may have been the time when it happened. As I understand the story about the ships, the fleet, which had doubtless been gathered in some of the southern ports, was to assemble at Chester, and thence to sail to support the King's land-force in Cumberland. \" His scypu,\" say the Chronicles, \" wendon ut abutan L\u00e6gceaster, and sceoldon cuman ongean hyne : ac hi ne meahton.\" But to get to Chester they had to sail round Wales, which Florence expresses by the words \" mandavit ut, circumnavigata septemtrionali Brytannia, in loco constituto sibi occurreret.\" Lappenberg (430) takes \"Monege\" in the Chronicles to be Anglesey; his translator (ii. 162), rightly I think, substitutes Man, but he adds the strange assertion, of which there is no trace in the original, that the fleet \" was ordered to sail round the north of the island,\" as if \" septemtrionalis Britannia \" meant Caithness. See p. 41, and the Winchester Chronicle, 922."], [696, "APPENDIX. 648 NOTE GG. p. 315. The Massacre of Saint Brioe. The account of the massacre in the Chronicles stands thus ; \" On pam geare se cyng bet ofslean ealle pa Deniscan men pa on Angelcynne w\u00e6ron. Dis w\u00e6s gedon on Britius m\u00e6ssed\u00e6g, forSam pam cynge w\u00e6s gecyd p\u00e6t hi woldon hine besyrewan \u00e6t his life, and siStSan ealle his witan, and habban siScSan pis rice.\" To this account I have in the present edition ventured to add one piece of local detail, namely the story of the Danes at Oxford who took refuge in Saint Frithswyth's minster. This is recorded in the charter of \u00c6thelred in Cod. Dipl. iii. 327, which is marked by Mr. Kemble as spurious or doubtful, but which I am now inclined to follow Mr. James Parker (Historical Notices of Oxford, p. 20) in accepting as at all events recording a real fact. The story runs thus ; \" Omnibus in hac patria degentibus sat constat fore notissi mum, quoddam a me decretum cum concilio optimatum satrapumque meorum exivit ut cuncti Dani qui in hac insula, velut lolium inter triticum, pullulando emerserant justissima examinatione necarentur, hocque decretum morte tenus ad effectum perduceretur, ipsi quique in pr\u00e6fata urbe [Oxoneford\u00e6] morabantur Dani mortem evadere nitentes, hoc Christi sacrarium, fractis per vim valvis et pessulis, intrantes, asyl\u00bbm sibi propugnaculumque contra urbanos sub urbanosque ibi fieri decreverunt ; sed cum populus omnis in sequens, necessitate compulsus, eos ejicere niteretur nee valeret, igne tabulis injecto hanc ecclesiam, ut liquet, cum munimentis ac libris combusserunt.\" I am now inclined to accept this story, and to hold that it has been wrongly transferred by William of Malmesbury to the time of the murder of Sigeferth and Morkere at Oxford in 1015. His story runs thus (ii. 179). After describing the murder of the two Thegns, much as in the Chronicle, but with some further details, he adds, \" clientuli eorum, dominorum necem vindicare conantes, armis repulsi et in turrim ecclesi\u00e6 Sanct\u00e6 Frideswid\u00e6 coacti, unde dum ejici nequirent, incendio conflagrati. Sed mox regis p\u0153nitentia, eliminata spurcitia, sacrarium repara tum ; legi ego scriptum quod in archivo ejusdem ecclesi\u00e6 contine tur index facti.\" This certainly looks very much as if William had seen the original of the charter, which records the reparation of the church (\" Dei adjutorio a me et a meis constat renovata \"), and had"], [697, "THE MASSACRE OF ST. BRICE. 649 put the story at a wrong time. That this is so is almost proved by the date. \u00c6thelred could have had no time for church restora tion between the Gemot of 1015 and his death in 1016. Between the massacre in 1002 and the date of the charter in 1004, though the state of things was not very favourable for such works, he had rather more time. The confusion between the two stories was easy. Sigeferth and Morkere and their followers, though not Danes in the same sense as the victims of Saint Brice, were almost certainly of Danish descent. In Florence we get the first touch of amplification in the general story. The rest of the passage he merely translates, but the words \" ealle pa Deniscan men pa on Angelcynne w\u00e6ron \" become \" omnes Danos Angliam incolentes, majores et minores, utriusque seams.\" This is the first hint of any slaughter of women, and it is confined to Danish women. William of Malmesbury directly mentions the massacre twice. The first time (ii. 165) it comes in almost incidentally, in a rheto rical passage about the character of \u00c6thelred and the wretched ness of his reign. He speaks of \" Danos, quos levibus suspicionibus omnes uno die in tota Anglia trucidari jusserat, ubi suit videre miseriam, dum quisque carissimos hospites, quos etiam arctissima necessitudo dulciores effecerat, cogeretur prodere et amplexus gladio deturbare.\" We begin here to get a dim vision of Danes possessed of English wives or mistresses. In the other passage (ii. 177) he describes the slaughter of Pallig, Gunhild, and their son, which is again brought in incidentally, as the moving cause of Swegen's great invasion in 1013. Gunhild, \"non illepid\u00e6 form\u00e6 virago,\" had given herself as a hostage on the conclusion of peace with the Danes (\" accepta Christianitate, obsidem se Danic\u00e6 pads fecerat \"). She was beheaded by order of Eadric (\" earn cum c\u00e6teris Danis infaustus furor Edrici decapitari jusserat\"), and, before her own death, she had to see her husband killed in some undescribed way, and her son, a promising lad, pierced with four spears (\"occiso prius ante ora marito, et filio, commod\u00e6 indolis puero, quattuor lanceis forato \"). I suspect, as I said in the text, that the notion of a massacre of women, which we find even in Florence, arose out of this one tale of Gunhild. In William of Jumieges (v. 6) we get some soul harrowing details ;"], [698, "650 APPENDIX. \" Edelredus, Anglorum rex, regnum, quod sub magna potentissi morum regum gloria diu floruerat, tanto nefari\u00e6 proditionis scelere regiminis sui tempore polluit, ut et pagani tarn exsecrabile nefas horrendum judicarent. Nam Danos per omne regnum unanimi concordia secum cohabitantes, mortis periculum minime suspicantes, subito furore sub una die perimi, mulieres quoque alvo tenus terr\u00e6 esse defossas, et ferocissimis canibus concitatis mamillas ab earum pectoribus crudeliter extorqueri, lactentes vero pueros ad domo rum postes allisos excerebrari jussit, nullis criminum existentibus culpis.\" Here we have only Danish women and Danish children. In the Roman de Rou (6352 et seqq.) we get the first hint of a massacre of English women. It is not directly asserted, but it seems to be implied. \" En Engleterre erent Daneis Cumune'ment od li Engleis, Des Englesches fames perneient, Filz et filles asez aveient.\" (vv. 6358-6361.) Then we read an account of nearly the same horrors as in William of Jumieges, with some improvements. The details of the throat cutting are given more minutely ; we hear also of embowelling (\"et as auquanz esbueloent \"), and not only dogs but bears are employed to tear off the breasts of the women. \"Li dames e li dameseiles Ors enchaenez e brohuns, Enfoient tresk 'as mameles, Ki lnr traient li cerveles Poiz amenoient li gainuns, E d^srumpeient li mameles.\" (vv. 6384-6389.) In both accounts the destruction is all but complete ; certain young men, two or more \u2014 \"quidam juvenes\" in William of Jumieges, \"douz valez\" in Wace \u2014 escape \u2014 according to William\u2014 in a ship which they found in the Thames, and carry the news to King Swegen in Denmark. We now turn to John of Wallingford, who died in 12 14, and who (Gale, ii. 547) knows much more about the matter. The Danes were far from being such comfortable neighbours to the English as they appear in the two Norman accounts. They held all the chief towns and did much mischief; \"optima terr\u00e6 municipia vel occupaverant vel pr\u00e6paraverant, et genti terr\u00e6 multas molestias inferebant.\" But the chief evil was the way in which they made themselves too agreeable to the English"], [699, "THE MASSACRE OF ST. BRICE. 651 women. They took great care of their persons ; they changed their clothes often, they combed their hair every day, and took a bath every Saturday ; \" habebant ex consuetudine patri\u00e6 unoquo que die comam pectere, sabbatis balneare, s\u00e6pe etiam vestituram mutare, et formam corporis multis talibus frivolis adjuvare.\" The consequence was that many English matrons broke their marriage vows and many noble maidens became mistresses of Danes. Many wars and confusions arose out of these and the other evil deeds of the Danes, till it was settled that each province should get rid of its own Danes ; \" ut qu\u00e6libet provincia suos Danos occideret.\" They were accordingly all killed on Saturday, their bathing-day. John of Wallingford does not mention the day of Saint Brice, but in 1002 that festival would really fall on a Saturday. Here we get the destruction of women and children ; but they are now distinctly the English women who had yielded to the seductions of the Danes and the children who were born of these unlawful unions ; \" ipsas mulieres suas, qu\u00e6 luxuries eorum consenserant, et pueros, qui ex f\u0153ditate adulterii nati erant.\" John of Walling ford does not employ either dogs or bears for the torture of the women ; he is satisfied with cutting off their breasts ; but those who had their breasts cut off and those who were put in the ground \u2014 in Italian phrase \"planted\" \u2014 now form two classes, while before there was only one ; \" mammas quarumdam abseide runt, alias vivas terr\u00e6 infoderunt.\" The number of young men who escape is raised to twelve. I must now go back a generation or two to Henry of Hunting don. He was living in 1154, yet he seems to profess to get his information from contemporaries \u2014 \" de quo scelere in pueritia nostra quosdam vetustissimos loqui audivimus.\" \u00c6thelred, ac cording to his account (M. H. B. 752 A), was puffed up with his marriage with Emma (\" quo proventu rex Adelred in superbiam elatus \"), and so massacred the Danes. He sent letters secretly to every town, ordering them to be put to death at one and the same hour, which was done on Saint Brice's day. Some were slain with the sword, others were burned; \"vel gladiis truncaverunt in pr\u00e6meditatos, vel igne simul cremaverunt subito comprehensos.\" There is no mention of women, not even of Gunhild. This account of Henry of Huntingdon appears in an abridged form in \u00c6thelred of Rievaux (Gen. Regg. X Scripts. 362), who"], [700, "652 APPENDIX. sarcastically adds that his royal namesake was \"fortior solito,\" though directly after he calls him, seemingly in earnest, \"rex strenuissimus.\" Roger of Wendover (i. 444) transfers the story to the year 1012. In his version Swegen is present in England at the time of the death of \u00c6lfheah ; the tribute is paid ; on its payment the Danes and English made a league of brotherhood to have but one heart and one soul ; Swegen goes back to Denmark ; then comes the massacre, on which Swegen comes back for his last invasion. The instigator of the massacre was \" Huna quidam, regis Ethelredi militi\u00e6 princeps, vir strenuus et bellicosus.\" The relations between Danes and English women are here, as in John of Wallingford, a chief ground of offence, but they take a somewhat different form ; \" Dani . . . per totam Angliam adeo invaluerant, quod uxores virorum nobilium regni et filias violenter opprimere et ubique ludibrio tradere pr\u00e6sumpserunt.\" We hear nothing of the Saturday bath and the other attractions of the Danes. Huna \u2014 a man who does not appear in history, but of whom we shall hear again in romance\u2014 complains of this state of things, and, by his advice, letters for a general massacre on Saint Brice's day are sent to all parts, much as in Henry of Huntingdon. The Danes, \" qui paullo ante cum Anglis, additio juramento, fuerant conf\u0153derati ut pacrfice cum illis habitarent,\" are massacred ; the women too \u2014 what women we are not told \u2014 are killed with their children, but now both are killed by being dashed against door-posts ; \" mulieres cum parvulis ad postes domorum allis\u00e6 animas miserabiliter effuderunt.\" Young men (\"quidam juvenes\") take the news to Swegen as before. Immediately after this, Roger goes ou to tell the story of Gunhild in a form founded on that of William of Malmesbury, but with some improvements. Not only Gunhild herself, but her husband and son are hostages (\" virago prudentissima, inter Danos et Anglos pacis mediatrix exsistens, obsidem sese cum viro et unico quern habebat filio, Ethelredo regi ad pacis securitatem dedit \"), a thing plainly impossible in the case of Pallig. William of Malmesbury had mentioned Eadric in connexion with her death, probably because he looked on Eadric as the author of the whole scheme of massacre. But, as Huna fills that post in Roger's story, Eadric becomes the special gaoler of Gunhild ; \" h\u00e6c quum fuisset"], [701, "ULFCYTEL OF EAST-ANGLIA. 653 a rege Eadrico duel\" \u2014 which he was in 1012, though not in 1002 \u2014 \"ad custodiendum commissa.\" Her death, by Eadric's order, and that of Pallig and their son, follow much as in William of Malmesbury. Here is a good case of the growth of legend, but the growth of legend is not all. It is easy to see from this last account that the massacre of Saint Brice got mixed up with quite different stories belonging to quite different dates, of which I shall have to speak again. The massacre of Saint Brice may be compared with the two mas sacres of the Goths recorded by Ammianus, xxxi. 16 ; Zosimos, iv. 26, 27, v. 35. The former, which was done \"datis tectioribus lit teris,\" is distinctly approved by both historians ; they speak of the \" consilium prudens\" and dyxwoia of Julius, the Eadric of the story, who took care that Theodosius, unlike \u00c6thelred, should not know of his scheme. The second is a massacre of women and children. NOTE HH. p. 322. Ulfcytel of East-Anglia. I have some doubt as to the formal position of Ulfcytel. The Latin writers all give him titles equivalent to Earl or Ealdorman. In Florence (1004) he is \" magn\u00e6 strenuitatis dux East-Anglorum Ulfketel.\" So Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 752 C) calls him \"Wlfketel dux illius provinci\u00e6,\" and William of Malmesbury (ii. 165) \"comes Orientalium Anglorum Ulfkillus.\" But the Chronicles introduce him at this point without any title, and though he signs several charters, as in this year in Cod. Dipl. iii. 334, in 1005 (iii. 346), and in 1012 (iii. 358), he uses no higher titles than \"minister\" and \"miles.\" On the other hand the Chronicles, in recording his death in 1016, seem to call him Ealdorman by implication; \"Godwine ealdorman on Lindesige and Ulfcytel on East-Anglum.\" And, as we find him gathering the forces of the earldom and summoning and consulting the local Witan, it is plain that he acted with the full authority of an Ealdorman. It has sometimes struck me that he may have been in some way a deputy of \u00c6thelweard who died along with him at Assandun, the son of the former Ealdorman \u00c6thelwine. See Appendix AA."], [702, "APPENDIX. 654 William of Malmesbury (u. s.) gives Ulfcytel the praise of being one who \" solus ex omnibus . . . impigre contra invasores restitit.\" He evidently made a great impression on the Danes themselves. We see this, not only from the passage in our own Chronicles quoted in p. 321, but from the mention of him in the Sagas. They speak of him, as William of Malmesbury does, by the con tracted form Ulfkill or Ulfkell, as Thurcytel becomes Thurkill. He bears the surname of Snilling, the Bold or Quick, and is described in the Knytlinga Saga, c. 15 (Johnstone, 138), as \" mikill hofdingi.\" His battle of Ringmere in 1010 (see p. 344) is there strangely transferred to the war of Cnut and Eadmund in 1 01 6. He appears again in the Saga of Saint Olaf (Laing, ii. 11 ; Johnstone, 93), where the battle of Ringmere is mixed up with the apocryphal and unintelligible exploits of Olaf. It should be marked that East-Anglia is called \" Ulfkelsland,\" just as our Chronicles talk of \" Ricardes rice \" and \" Baldwines land.\" We meet him again in the Jomsvikinga Saga, c. 51 (Johnstone, 101), where he is described as ruler of the whole North of England, and as mar ried to Wulfhild daughter of King \u00c6thelred (\" Nordr red fyrir Englandi Ulfkell Snillingr, hann atti Ulfhildi dottur Adalrads konungs \"). See Appendix SS. NOTE II. p. 326. The Rise of Eadric. I describe Eadric as I find him described in contemporary writers. I fully admit that there is much in his character, actions, and general position which is extremely puzzling ; but I cannot undertake to be wise above what is written, or to put a theory of my own in the place of the unanimous witness of all our authorities. It has been ingeniously argued that Eadric was simply a forerunner of Leofric, that he represents a Mercian, therefore an intermediate, policy, which was misunderstood or misrepresented by West-Saxon writers. But all our authorities, AVest-Saxon as well as Mercian, agree in giving Leofric a very good character ; all our authorities, Mercian as well as West- Saxon, agree in giving Eadric a very bad character. He has been called a \" Trimmer,\" and, as such, he has been likened, not"], [703, "THE RISE OF EADRIC. 655 only to the Leofric of the generation following his own, but to the Halifax of a much later age. The obvious answer is that neither Leofric nor Halifax was ever charged with going about murdering people in various parts of the kingdom. Now, as I have already said (see p. 417), many of the particular crimes laid to the charge of Eadric are open to much doubt ; but the evident general belief that, whenever any mischief was done, Eadric must have been the doer of it, points to an universal estimate of his general character which cannot have been mistaken. The first mention of Eadric in the Chronicles is on his appoint ment to the Ealdormanship of Mercia in 1007. He there comes in without any notice of his character or parentage, but the opinion which the Chroniclers had of him is shown plainly enough in other passages, as when the death of Sigeferth and Morkere is described in 1015 and the battle of Assandun in 1016. Florence first introduces him as \" dolosus et perfidus Edricus Streona,\" in 1006, when he records the murder of \u00c6lfhelm. William of Malmesbury, as we have seen in the last Note, attributes to him the murder of Gunhild in 1002, and perhaps the whole plot for the destruction of the Danes. Florence gives a fuller character of him in 1007, when recording his appointment as Ealdorman. It runs as follows ; \"Rex Edrfcum supra memoratum, \u00c6gelrici filium, hominem humili quidem genere, sed cui lingua divitias ac nobilitatem com paraverat, callentem ingenio, suavem eloquio, et qui omnes id temporis mortales, turn invidia atque perfidia, turn superbia et crudelitate, superavit, Merciorum constituit ducem.\" These words of Florence seem to have been before William of Malmesbury, when, in his general picture of the reign of \u00c6thelred (ii. 165), after speaking of the treasons of \u00c6lfric, whom he con founds with the son of \u00c6lfhere, he goes on, \"Erat in talibus improbe idoneus Edricus, quern rex comitatui Merciorum pr\u00e6fecerat ; f\u00e6x hominum et dedecus Anglorum, flagi tiosus helluo, versutus nebulo, cui non nobilitas opes pepererat, sed lingua et audacia comparaverat [\"non\" and \"sed\" are left out in some manuscripts, but they are clearly needed to make up the sense]. Hie dissimulare cautus, fingere paratus, consilia regis ut fidelis venabatur, ut proditor disseminabat. S\u00e6pe, ad hostes missus"], [704, "656 APPENDIX. pacis mediator, pugnam accendit. Cujus perfidia, quum crebro hujus regis tempore, turn vel maxime sequentis apparuit.\" Henry of Huntingdon too, whose authority is of the most varying degrees of value, but who always represents an independent tra dition, says (M. H. B. 752 E), in recording Eadric's appointment to the ealdormanship, \" Dei providentia ad perniciem Anglorum factus est Edricus dux super Merce, proditor novus sed maximus.\" The surname of Streona comes, as we have just seen, from Flo rence. Eadric also appears as Heinrekr or Airekr Striona in Snorro (Johnstone, 98), and in another Saga (101), where we are astounded at finding him made a brother of Emma. (The name Henry, in any of its forms, is hardly English, but we find in Cod. Dipl. iii. 87 a \"Heanric minister,\" perhaps one of the Old-Saxons favoured by Eadgar.) In Orderic too (506 B) a later Eadric is said to be \" nepos Edrici pestiferi ducis cognomento Streone, id est acquisitoris.\" The nickname evidently alludes to his great accu mulations of property. To trace Eadric and his father \u00c6thelric by the charters is not easy, as neither name is uncommon. Thus we find in Cod. Dipl. iii. 304, a will of a certain \u00c6thelric in Essex, made in 997, in which an Eadric is mentioned, who however seems not to be his son but his tenant. This \u00c6thelric lay under suspicion of treason able dealings with Swegen at the time of his first invasion in 994 (\" (Sam kincge w\u00e6s ges\u00e6d S\u00e6t he w\u00e6re on tSam unr\u00e6de, cS\u00e6t man sceolde on East-Sexon Swegen underfon Sa he \u00e6rest pyder mid flotan com\"). See Cod. Dipl. iii. 314, a document which the com bined signatures of Archbishop \u00c6lfric (see p. 292) and Ealdorman Leofsige (see p. 313) fix to some date between 995 and 1002. Another \u00c6thelric distinguished himself in quite an opposite way in the same part of the world, for he appears as one of the heroes of Maldon (see Thorpe, Analecta, p. 139). This last is probably the \u00c6thelric \" minister \" and \" miles,\" who signs many charters from 987 to 1006 (see Cod. Dipl. iii. 228-351). In the last char ter, if it be genuine, he describes himself as \"the old\" \u2014 \"\u00c6Selric ealda trywe gewitnys.\" This is not unlikely to be the \u00c6thelric who appears as a legatee in the will of Wulfric Spot, Cod. Dipl. vi. 148. Then there are one or more churchmen of the name, who, with the titles of \"clericus,\" \"diaconus,\" and \"monachus\" sign a vast number of documents of Archbishop Oswald and his successor"], [705, "THE RISE OF EADRIC. 657 Ealdwulf from 977 to 996 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 159-296), and one of whom possibly goes on till 1017 (see Cod. Dipl. vi. 177). I almost suspect that it is in one of these clerical \u00c6thelrics that we are to look for the father of Eadric. It is certain that, among the many persons to whom Archbishop Oswald grants Church lands on the usual terms for three lives, three separate grants are made to a Thegn of his named Eadric. See Cod. Dipl. iii. 164, 216, 241. The dates are 977, 985, 988. May not these be the beginnings of the traitor? An Eadric also appears in Cod. Dipl. iii. 293, and another in vi. 127 ; but the latter at least is not our Eadric, as he was dead before 993. The first signature which seems likely to be that of the future Ealdorman is one in iooi (Cod. Dipl. iii. 317) as \" Eadric minister.\" He signs many charters by that title, including two (vi. 143) in company with a namesake of the same rank. In 1007 (vi. 157, 159) he of course begins to sign as \"dux.\" The charter of 1004 (vi. 151) where he appears as \" dux\" cannot be genuine, as King \u00c6thelred, Archbishop \u00c6thelnoth, and Ealdorman Brihtnoth are made to sign together. Lappenberg also (431, note 2. The passage is left out in Mr. Thorpe's translation) quotes a charter of Eadgar in 970 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 56) as containing the signatures of Eadric and most of his brothers. But it is quite impossible that this can be our Eadric. Mr. Kemble marks the Latin version, in which alone the signatures occur, as spurious. The English version, which he accepts, has no signatures. That Eadric rose to power by the fall of Wulfgeat is nowhere said in so many words; but the confiscation of the goods of Wulfgeat and the first mention of Eadric are put by Florence significantly near to one another. Wulfgeat signs a great many charters from 986 to 1005 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 224-345 and vi. 154). But he nowhere appears with any higher title than \"minister,\" except an one document of 996 (Cod. Dipl. vi. 136) where he appears as \"dux.\" I suspect that Wulfgeat, as well as Eadric, rose in the beginning through the favour of Archbishop Oswald. At least Oswald grants lands in Worcestershire to a knight of his of that name (\" sumum cnihte Sam is Wulfgeat noma,\" Cod. Dipl. iii. 259). This was in the reign of Eadward. The confiscation of Wulfgeat's goods is recorded in the Chronicles for 1006 without remark ; \" And on pam ilcan geare w\u00e6s Wulfgeate eall his ar VOL. 1. V u"], [706, "APPENDIX. 658 ongenumen.\" Florence says, \" Rex \u00c6gelredus Wlfgeatum Leovec\u00e6 filium, quern pene omnibus plus dilexerat, propter injusta judicia et superba qu\u00e6 gesserat opera, possessionibus omnique honore pri vavit.\" There is also a charter of 1006 (Cod. Dipl. vi. 160), in which we find a notice of Wulfgeat as marrying one \u00c6lfgifu the widow of \u00c6lfgar (was this \u00c6lfgar the son of \u00c6lfric ?) and as hold ing some lands which had been taken by \u00c6lfgar from the monastery of Abingdon. His wife is described as sharing both in his crimes and in his fall ; \" Qui ambo crimine pessimo juste ab omni incusati sunt populo caussa su\u00e6 machinationis propri\u00e6, de qua modo non est dicendum per singula, propter quam vero machinationem qu\u00e6 injuste adquisierunt omnia juste perdiderunt.\" Another charter of 1015 (Cod. Dipl. vi. 169) is more express. In this \u00c6thelred grants to Brihtwold the Bishop of the diocese (who succeeded in the year of Wulfgeat's disgrace), the lands of Wulfgeat at Chilton in Berkshire (\"illo in loco ubi solicol\u00e6 appellativo usu Cildatun nominant\"). Here we read, \"Nam quidam minister Wulfget vulgari relatu nomine pr\u00e6fatam terram aliquando possederat; sed quia inimicis regis se in insidiis socium applicavit, et in faci nore inficiendi etiam legis satisfactio ei defeeit, ideo h\u00e6reditatis suberam penitus amisit, et ex ea pr\u00e6nominatus episcopus pr\u00e6scrip tam villulam, me concedente, suscepit.\" The estate was not given to the see, but to Brihtwold personally, with power to bequeath it. I cannot identify Wulfgeat's father, which makes it the more pro bable that he was, like Eadric, a man of low birth. The appointment of Eadric to the Mercian ealdormanship in 1007 is distinct in all the Chronicles and in Florence. His mar riage with the King's daughter Eadgyth took place before 1009, when Florence speaks of him as the King's son-in-law, \" gener ejus, habuit enim in conjugio filiam ejus Edgitham.\" His eleva tion to the ealdormanship is the most natural date for the marriage. There may perhaps be some reference to this marriage in the wonderful declamation of Walter Map against \u00c6thelred (De Nugis, 202). He charges him with systematically preferring slaves to freemen, and giving the daughters of nobles to \" rustici,\" that is, in the language of his day, villains. By \"servi\" and \"rustici\" he most likely means merely ceorls. \" Superbus servi oculus et insatiabile cor in ipsius beneplacito ministrabat.\""], [707, "THE SUCCESSION OF THE NORTHUMBRIAN EARLS. 659 NOTE KK. p. 329. The Succession of the Northumbrian Earls. I did not come across Mr. Robertson's \" Scotland under Early Kings \" till the greater part of the first edition of my first volume was printed. I had therefore no opportunity, till towards the end of the volume, of making any use of his excellent note on the Danelage (ii. 430), which is one of the best parts of his work. The history of Northumberland from the ninth century onwards is there traced out with greater clearness and probability than I have ever seen it dealt with elsewhere. His great point, which he seems to me fully to establish, is, that at the great conquest of Northumber land in \u00c6lfred's time, Deira only was actually divided and occupied by the Danes, while Bernicia, into whatever degree of subjection it may have been brought to the Danish power, still remained occu pied by Englishmen, and under the immediate government of English rulers. The local nomenclature, as Mr. Robertson shows, bears out this view, and it also explains the otherwise puzzling fact that that part of old Northumberland which is quite away from the Humber has kept the name of Northumberland to this day, an usage which certainly began as early as the eleventh century (see Chron. Wig. 1065 and Sim. Dun. 80). Indeed Simeon (147) dis tinguishes \"Eboraeum\" and \"Northimbri\" as early as 883 ; but he is doubtless using the language of his own time, as he is not following the earlier Northumbrian Chronicle. With these Anglian rulers of Bernicia I have no concern till the Commendation of 924, when the \" son of Eadwulf,\" and again in 926 \" Ealdred Eadulfing,\" appears among the princes who submitted to \u00c6thelstan. Ealdred's son was Oswulf, who signs two charters of Eadred in 949 as lord of Bamburgh, \"Osulf ad bebb. hehgf\" (Cod. Dipl. ii. 292), and \"Osulf bebb.\" (ii. 296). The abbreviation \"hehgf\" stands, ac cording to Mr. Robertson, for heah-gerefa. And I can certainly suggest nothing better, though it is strange to find so purely ministerial a title applied to one who seems to have been rather a vassal prince than a mere magistrate. In 954, on the final con quest of Northumberland by Eadred, Oswulf seems to have exchanged this infinitesimal kind of kingship for the earldom over both provinces. See Sim. Dun. 204, who goes on to mention the U u 2"], [708, "660 APPENDIX. division of the two earldoms between Oswulf and Oslac ; \" Qui [Osulfus] postea regnante Eadgaro socium accepit Oslacum. Deinde Osulfus ad aquilonalem plagam Tin\u00e6, Oslac vero super Eboracura et ejus fines curas administrabat.\" The appointment of Oslac is noticed by three of the Chronicles in the year 966, and his banishment in 975 is recorded in prose and lamented in verse. The next Earl was Waltheof, who seems to have been a son of Oswulf, and I gather from the words of Simeon (204) \u2014 \"His [Osulfo et Oslaco] successit Walthef senior \" \u2014 that he again held both earldoms. But they must have been again dismembered at some time before 993, when \u00c6lfhelm, who had signed as \"minister\" in 985 (Cod. Dipl. vi. 121), begins to sign as \"dux\" (iii. 271). An earlier signature as \"Comes\" in 990 (iii. 251) is doubtful. Cf. iii. 253. In 997 (iii. 304) he signs as \" NorSanhumbrensium provinciarum dux.\" The only signature of Waltheof himself that I know of is one of \"W\u00e6lSeof dux\" in 994 (iii. 280). That Uhtred (p. 329) held both earldoms on the deposition of his father and the murder of \u00c6lfhelm seems plain from the words of Simeon (80), \" Rex Ethel redus, vocato ad se juvene pr\u00e6fato, vivente adhuc patre Waltheof, pro merito su\u00e6 strenuitatis et bello quod tain viriliter peregerat, dedit ei comitatum patris sui, adjungens etiam Eboracensem comi tatum.\" Tiiis last was evidently the earldom made void by the death of \u00c6lfhelm. The death of Uhtred and the bestowal of the Northumbrian earldom on Erie the Dane by Cnut I have mentioned at pp. 379> 524- Mr. Robertson (i. 95, ii. 442) seems to confine the Northumbrian government of Erie to Deira, while he extends his frontier southward as far as Watling-Street. But the fourfold division of England implies that Eric ruled over all Northumberland. On the other hand, Simeon (81), speaking in his own person (see Stubbs, Preface to R. Howden, i. xxx), in a marked way confines the government of Ealdred, the successor of Eadwulf, to Bernicia. \" Aldredus, quern pr\u00e6dictus comes Ucthredus genuerat ex Ecfrida Alduni episcopi filia, .... solius Northumbri\u00e6 comitatum suscepit, patrisque sui interfectorem interfecit Turebrandum.\" \" North humbria,\" it will be seen, is here used in the most modern sense. The obvious inference is that Eadwulf ruled at first in Bernicia only and under the superiority of Eric, but that, on Eric's banish ment, he succeeded to the government of all Northumberland"], [709, "THE ASSESSMENT OF 1008. 661 immediately under the King. Simeon gives us no dates, and Siward's accession to Deira may have followed the death of Eadwulf Cutel. Everything looks as if the reign of Ealdred was very short. One question remains as to Thored, who signs as \" dux \" in 979, 983, and 988 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 171, 198, 237), and in the Chronicles (992) is distinguished as \"pored eorl\" from \"\u00c6lfric ealdorman.\" He was therefore in all probability Earl of Deira or Yorkshire (see Robertson, ii. 441). He is doubtless the same as Thored the son of Gunner, who, according to the Chronicles, harried Westmorland in 966, and, according to some accounts (see below, Note SS), he was the father of \u00c6thelred's first wife. He was no doubt succeeded by \u00c6lfhelm in 993, and he must himself have been appointed as early as 979. Mr. Robertson conjectures that he succeeded on the banishment of Oslac in 975. But we have seen that Waltheof then succeeded to both earldoms. My conjecture therefore is that the two earldoms- were again separated on the accession of \u00c6thelred, Deira being given to Thored. If \u00c6thelred really married Thored's daughter, this is still more likely. There can be no doubt that Eorl (see p. 407) is the proper title of a governor of Deira (see Cod. Dipl. ii 293, and the Laws of Eadgar, Schmid, 198). But the Chronicles do not always observe the distinction. The pointed marking out of Thored as \"eorl\" and \u00c6lfric as \"ealdorman\" is an unusual piece of accuracy, and though Oslac, when his banishment in 975 is recorded, is called \" se m\u00e6ra eorl,\" yet his appointment in 966 is expressed by the words \"feng to ealdordome.\" NOTE LL. p. 339. The Assessment of 1008 The Abingdon and Peterborough Chronicles for 1008 have, \" Her bebead se cyng p\u00e6t man sceolde ofer eall Angelcyn scypu f\u00e6stlice wyrcan ; p\u00e6t is cSonne ; of prim hund hidum and of tynum \u00e6nne scegS, and of viii hidum helm and byrnan.\""], [710, "APPENDIX. 662 So Florence ; \" Rex Anglorum \u00c6gelredus de cccx cassatis unam trierem, de novem vero loricam et cassidem fieri, et per totam Angliam naves intense pr\u00e6cepit fabricari.\" So Henry of Hunting don (M. H. B. 753 A) and Lappenberg, ii. 170. But the Worcester Chronicle (Cott. Tib. B. iv.) reads \" of prym hund scipum and x be tynum anne sc\u00e6gtS.\" I quote Mr. Earle's note, without confidently pledging myself to his interpretation, further than that I feel sure that the assessment must have been made by shires in some shape or other. If anything else were needed to prove it, the bequest of \u00c6lfric so appositely quoted by Mr. Earle, and which I have not scrupled to mention in the text, would alone be enough. \" In this rating of land for raising a navy, the numbers are so unconformable to the statistical numbers preserved elsewhere, and so incommensurate with each other, that they must be received with suspicion. All the texts agree, except D [the Worcester Chronicle], which, of all extant texts, is probably the nearest to the source. In the confusion of the text of D, may possibly be found materials for a future emendation. \" But, taken at its worst, the annal is rich in interest. We learn the curious fact, that it was incumbent on each of the landed subdivisions, to provide the king with a ship and its armour. The government did not levy ship-money, but required each county to find its quota of ships. This would apply as well to the inland districts, as to those on the sea-board. And here we find the explanation of an otherwise inexplicable bequest of good Abp. \u00c6lfric, who died two years before this date. He gave one ship to the folk of Kent, and one to Wiltshire. The will is in Cod. Dipl. 716 [iii. 351]. Doubtless, in each of the cases, the bequest was intended as an alleviation of the heavy imposts under which the people groaned. His gift being to the shire, is an argument that the assessment was by shires. It appears to me probable that each shire had to furnish one ship for every three Hundreds contained in the shire. Thus a shire containing thirty Hundreds would have to furnish ten ships. (Accordingly, D may be right : of prym hunfl scipum: ? = of three Hundreds \u2014 Hundertschaften.) This burden would fall on the whole body of the people, according to their rating. But the wealthy landowners had a special burden besides. He who had property up to or over the extent of ten"], [711, "WULFNOTH OF SUSSEX. 663 hides, would have to furnish a sceg'iS \u2014 and every thane under ten hides, had to furnish a helmet and breastplate.\" The scegcS, according to Mr. Earle and Dr. Schmid, seems to be a smaller kind of vessel. It is a pity that even Florence was so far carried away by the wish to appear classical as to talk about triremes, instead of using words which might express the different kinds of vessels spoken of. On Mr. Earle's showing, the special imposts laid on the great landowners would exactly answer to the Attic XeiTovpylai. But it tells somewhat against his interpretation that both Florence and Henry of Huntingdon follow the reading of the other manuscripts. In any case I must confess that I do not clearly understand about the helm and breastplate. NOTE MM. p. 343. Wulfnoth of Sussex. Most writers assume that \"Wulnoth Child the South-Saxon,\" as he is called in all the Chronicles, was at once the nephew of Eadric and the father of Earl Godwine. These questions I shall discuss in a later Note, specially devoted to the origin of the Earl. I will only say here that it seems to me that, whoever was the father of Godwine, Florence did not intend to identify the Wulfnoth who, he says, was nephew to Eadric, with Child Wulfnoth the South-Saxon. That Brihtric, the accuser of Wulfnoth, was a brother of Eadric rests on the authority of all the Chronicles. They all call him \"Brihtric, Eadrices brorSor ealdormannes.\" Florence gives him the character of being \"homo lubricus, ambitiosus, et superbus,\" and adds that the accusation was unjust. He had also just before given the following list of the brothers of Eadric or sons of \u00c6thelric; \"cujus fratres exstiterunt Brihtricus, \u00c6lfricus, Goda, \u00c6gelwinus, \u00c6gelwardus, \u00c6gelm\u00e6rus, pater Wlnothi, patris West- Saxonum ducis Godwini.\" The charters are full \u2014 take for instance Cod. Dipl. iii. 355 and vi. 164, 166 \u2014 of signatures which may be the signatures of those brothers. But all the names are common, except perhaps Goda, unless it be a short form of Godric or"], [712, "APPENDIX. 664 Godwine. For instance, one charter in Cod. Dipl. iii. 345, 346 is signed by three distinct Brihtrics, all with the rank of \" minister.\" In one place (iii. 351), if the document be genuine, \" Byrhtric cinges begen gewitnys\" signs between Eadric and one who may be their father (see above, p. 656). In vi. 155 we have a \" Brihtric reada\" in Dorsetshire, and in the Chronicles (1017) a \"Brihtric \u00c6lfehes suna on Defenascire,\" who may be the same as the Brihtric of Dorset, but who is of course different from the brother of Eadric. Of \u00c6thelweards we find several in the early days of Cnut. In seems in vain tortry to make out anything more about the family, except that, according to Orderic (506 B), Eadric the Wild, so famous sixty years later, was Eadric's nephew or grand son \u2014 \" nepos Edrici pestiferi ducis.\" The title of \"cild\" or \"child\" given to Wulfnoth is a puzzling one. Florence translates it by \" minister,\" as if it were the same as Thegn ; Henry of Huntingdon by \" puer nobilis.\" It is found in one other place only in the Chronicles, namely in 1074, where it is applied to the younger Eadgar, as if it were the same as \u00c6cSeling. We have seen it (see above, p. 641) as the title of one of the \u00c6lfrics, who in English is \" cild\" and in Latin \" cognomento Puer.\" Several men bear the title in Domesday, as \" Alnod cilt \" (2 et al), Eadwine, miscalled Godwine, Abbot of Westminster (146), Edward \"cilt,\" a man of Earl Harold (146, 148, 212, 3366, 340), and several others, Brixi, Eadwig, Leofric, Leofwine, and others, whom I do not profess to identify. See Ellis, ii. 68. In a deed of Bishop \u00c6lfwold T. R. E. in Cod. Dipl. vi. 196, we find the signature of a \" Dodda cild\" (see vol. ii. Appendix G), seemingly a kinsman of Earl Odda. From all these examples, and from the later use of the word, \" Childe Waters\" and the like, one would think that \"cild\" was in some way or other a title of honour, though it is not at all easy to see exactly what it implied in the way of rank or office. On the other hand we find an \u00c6thelric (\u00c6ilricus) \" cild,\" as also an Eadwine \" cniht,\" among the inferior tenants of Battle Abbey. Chron. de Bello, 14, 15. The story of Wulfnoth, as welf as his personality, is puzzling. We hear nothing of the nature of the charge against him or of the punishment which seems to have been designed for him. In the Chronicles we simply read that the accusation was brought and that Wulfnoth took to flight and began to plunder. Florence"], [713, "WULFNOTH OF SUSSEX. 665 says \"ne caperetur, mox fugam iniit.\" Henry of Huntingdon, who does not mention the charge brought by Brihtric, says \" Rex exsulaverat Wlnod.\" So William of Malmesbury (ii. 165), who brings the story in only casually, in his general picture of the reign of \u00c6thelred. He says nothing of the flight of Wulfnoth or the pursuit of Brihtric. He mentions the storm and adds, \" Pauc\u00e6 de reliquiis multarum fact\u00e6, impetu cujusdam Wulnodi, quern rex exlegatum ejecerat, submers\u00e6 vel incens\u00e6.\" Nor have we the least hint given as to whither Wulfnoth went, or what he did, after he had burned the hundred ships. He may have joined the Danes or have done anything else in the wiking line ; I cannot believe that he went and lived quietly in Gloucestershire. In this uncertainty, modern writers seem to have thought that they had full licence to give play to their imaginations, and the results are remarkable. Mr. St. John for instance and M. de Bonnechose display a minute knowledge of the actions and motives of all parties which certainly cannot be got by the dull process of groping in the Chronicles. Let us hear Mr. St. John (Four Conquests, ii. 21) ; \" About the vicious and bewildered king, the earl of Mercia and his brethren clung like the fabled serpents about Laocoon. They were seven in all \u2014 Edric, Brihtric, Elfric, Goda, Ethelwine, Ethelward, and Ethelmere \u2014 and between them was incessantly carried on a reckless straggle for pre-eminence. Being all desirous of monopolizing the favour of Ethelred, they plotted against each other, and pursued their designs with relentless vindictiveness. \" Ethelmere, the youngest of the brothers, had a son, Wulfnoth, who for his courage and capacity had been made Childe of the South-Saxons, a post of great honour and distinction. This ex cited rancorous envy in the breast of his uncle Brihtric, who, in order to compass his overthrow, accused him of treason to the king. Familiar with the cruel and capricious temper of Ethelred, the young earl effected his escape from London.\" The French writer, M. Emile de Bonnechose (Quatre Conquetes de l'Angleterre, ii. 17), is almost more remarkable than Mr. St. John. \"De nouvelles defections aneantirent bientot les forces navales des Anglo-Saxons: un de leurs chefs, nomme\" Wulnoth, pere du fameux comte Godwin, prit la suite avec vingt vaisseaux. Britric, commandant de la flotte,.poursuivit le fugitif.\" No hint"], [714, "APPENDIX. 666 whatever why Wulfnoth fled. Presently (ii. 56) we read of \" le service que ce Wulnoth rendit au roi Sweyn en lui livrant une partie de la flotte qu'il commandait et en briilant le reste,\" events of which the Chronicles preserve no mention whatever. More amazing than all, Wulfnoth is elsewhere described (ii. 54) as \" churl ou chef des Saxons du sud,\" much as if one were to talk of a man being \" Roturier or Duke of Montmorency.\" NOTE NN. p. 344- Thurkill the Dane. This name, like many others, appears in a fuller form in Eng land than in Denmark. The English bearers of it, all doubtless of Danish descent, are always called Thurcytel. The famous Dane himself always appears, whether in Latin, English, or Danish, in a shortened form, Thurkill or something like it, in various spellings. Our Thurkill comes before us in very different lights in different accounts. In the Chronicles we first hear of him as commanding the fleet which came in 1009. The three Chronicles all agree in saying that soon after Lammas an innumerable fleet came to Sandwich (\" pi com sona \u00e6fter lafm\u00e6ssam [\" hlammessan,\" Petrib.] se ungem\u00e6tlica unfricS here to Sandwic\"), but Abingdon alone adds \" pe we heton Durkilles here.\" Florence distinguishes the fleet of Thurkill from the fleet of Heming and Eglaf (\" Danicus comes Turkillus sua cum classe ad Angliam venit : exinde mense Augusto alia classis Danorum innumerabilis, cui pr\u00e6erant duces Hemingus et Eglafus,\" &c.). But the two fleets meet in Thanet and sail together to Sandwich. We then hear no more of Thurkill by name till 1013, but it is plain that all the ravages done up to Swegen's invasion in that year were done by \" Durkilles here.\" In 1013 (see p. 360) we suddenly find him on the English side. He is in London with \u00c6thelred (\" forSan p\u00e6r w\u00e6s inge se cyng \u00c6pelred and purcyl mid him\"), and directly after (see p. 361) we find him and \u00c6thelred together in the fleet in the Thames. This makes it plain that the forty-five ships which went over to \u00c6thelred in 1012 (see p. 356) were Thurkill's ships or a part of them. It"], [715, "THURKILL THE DANE. 667 was plainly then that he changed sides. We hear of his fleet again in 1014, when a Danegeld was paid to it (see p. 371); and again in 1015, when Eadric seduced \"the forty ships from the King's service \" (\" Eadric ealdorman aspeon pa fowertig scipa fram pam cyningc \"). But Thurkill's name is not mentioned again till 1017 (see p. 407) when Cnut gives him one of the four great Earl doms, namely East-Anglia. In 1020 (see p. 426) he appears along with Cnut at the consecration on Assandun ; in 102 1 (see p. 428) he is outlawed; in 1023 (see p. 429) he is reconciled to the King and seems to become his lieutenant in Denmark, but we hear no more of him in England. Florence mentions Thurkill whenever he is mentioned in the Chronicles, except in the account of his reconciliation with Cnut, which appears in the Abingdon Chronicle only. He makes matters somewhat plainer about \"the forty ships\" in 1015, saying that Eadric \" de regia classe XL naves, Danicis militibus instructas, sibi allexit.\" He also, in recording Thurkill's banishment in 102 1, adds the name of his wife ; \" Canutus rex . . . Turkillum supra dictum comitem cum uxore sua Edgitha expulit Anglia.\" It should be noticed that neither in the Chronicles nor in Florence is there any mention of Thurkill during the wars of Cnut and Eadmund in 1016. As for the charters we can hardly expect to find him signing during the reign of \u00c6thelred. In Cnut's time, 1018-1019, we find him signing as \"dux\" (Cod. Dipl. iv. i, 3, 6, 9). His sig nature to the document of HealtSegen Scearpa in 1026 (Cod. Dipl. iv. 32) is more puzzling, as it would imply a return of Thurkill to England, of which there is no other trace. But that document, though not marked doubtful or spurious by Mr. Kemble, seems to me most suspicious. Godwine signs as \"pegen,\" but before all the Earls, and the Earls who sign are Siward, \u00c6lfgar, Thurkill, Leofric, Swegen, Tostig, and Eadred. I cannot identify any Earls \u00c6lfgar and Swegen in the time of Cnut, and the Tostig of those days (see Note WWW) is a half-mythical person. It is very doubtful too (see Note CCC) whether Leofric was an Earl so early as 1026, and Siward seems not to have been an Earl till Harthacnut's time. I cannot help thinking that an unskilful forger adapted the names from some charter of Eadward, and that Swegen and Tostig are the sons of Godwine moved out of their"], [716, "668 APPENDIX. places. I do not think that we can bring Thurkill back to Eng land without some better evidence than this. We must also take care to distinguish Earl Thurkill from several contemporary Thurkills of lesser degree. There is, for instance, a \" Durkill minister \" who signs in 1023 (iv. 27), and a Thurkill the White (\" Durcil hwita\") who figures in a private document at iv. 54. He goes into Herefordshire on the King's errand along with Tofig the Proud. Of another Thurkill, or the same, there is a long story in the Ramsey History, c. 84. William of Malmesbury seems to have a special dislike to Thurkill. He mentions him only twice (ii. 176, 181), and both times charges him with being the chief instigator of the murder of \u00c6lfheah, which, from the better authority of Thietmar (see Note PP), we know that he tried to hinder. The first passage runs thus ; \" Resederat in Anglia Turkillus Danus, qui fuerat incentor ut lapidaretur archiepiscopus, habebatque Orientales Anglos su\u00e6 voluntati parentes. Tarn c\u00e6teri, dato ab Anglis octo millium librarum tributo, per urbes et agros, quo quisque commodius poterat, dilapsi : quindecim eorum naves cum hominibus regis fidem sequut\u00e6. Turkillus interea regem patri\u00e6 su\u00e6 Suanum nuntiis accersit ut Angliam veniat.\" This is followed by a rhetorical description, put into Thurkill's mouth, of the vices and weakness of \u00c6thelred and of England. Here are several manifest misstatements; besides the misrepre sentation as to the death of \u00c6lfheah, nothing is plainer than that Thurkill, who stood by \u00c6thelred to the last, did not invite Swegen into England. The only question is whether any trace of truth lurks in the words which seem to attribute to Thurkill a settle ment in East-Anglia earlier than his investiture with that earldom by Cnut. The other passage is equally unfair. The removal of Thurkill from England is thus described ; \" Succedente tempore Turkillus et Iricius, ab Anglia captatis occasionibus eliminati, natale solum petierunt; quorum primus, qui incentor necis beati Elfegi fuerat, statim ut Danemarchi\u00e6 littus attigit a ducibus oppressus est.\" This last statement is directly contradicted by the Chronicles; but it shows us where William of Malmesbury got his notion of Thurkill, namely from the two tracts of Osbern on the martyrdom of \u00c6lfheah and his Translation. In the latter"], [717, "THURKILL THE DANE. 669 (Anglia Sacra, i. 144) we get a wonderful account of Thurkill. He is \"male audax princeps malorum Thyrkyllus, pauco tempore pr\u00e6do futurus, sed in \u00e6ternum damnati spiritus pr\u00e6da mansurus \" \u2014 a hard fate for the co-founder of Assandun and benefactor of Saint Eadmund's. He remains in England after the death of \u00c6lf heah, but presently Cnut comes, seemingly on the errand of getting rid of Thurkill and his followers (\" Cnut . . . diffidens ab illo propter quasdam res male ac perfide actas, quidquid residuum infandi populi esse poterat, sicut tabul\u00e6 stilo deleri solent, delevit, ipsumque ducem sex tantummodo navibus munitum in Danamar cam fugavit\"). Thurkill goes to Denmark; being suspected of a design to stir up civil wars, he is hunted down and killed, and his body is left unburied (\" ne intestina bella moliretur, statim per cuncta regionis illius loca agitatus, ad ultimum ab ignobili vulgo occisus, ferisque et avibus est miserabiliter projectus \"). This is plainly the source whence William of Malmesbury got his account of Thurkill's death ; still he knew the history too well to accept Osbern's introduction of Thurkill (ii. 131) as at first a joint commander with Swegen, and then, after Swegen's death, his successor (\" pirat\u00e6 . . . ducibus Swano et Thurkyllo, principibus Danorum fortissimis, nonnullam terr\u00e6 Anglorum maculam intole- rant. Sed Swano ab omnipotenti Deo terribiliter occiso, Thyrkillus malign\u00e6 h\u00e6reditatis principatum sortitus est \"). Osbern evidently looked on Thurkill as the author of all evil, but he does not again mention him by name. It is worth thinking whether William of Malmesbury 's notion of Thurkill's settlement in East-Anglia at this time arose from any confusion with the partition which, ac- cording to Osbern (see Note PP), was to be made between Eadric and the Danes. William of Malmesbury 's statement that Thurkill invited Swegen into England probably comes from some confusion with the narra tive of the Encomiast. This last writer makes (i. 2) Thurkill go to England by Swegen's leave to avenge the death of a brother who had been killed there, perhaps in the massacre of Saint Brice. But, once in England, he goes over to the English side, and seem ingly obtains some establishment in the country (\" meridianam partem provinci\u00e6 victor obtinet \"). One main object of Swegen's expedition is said to be to win back, by force or persuasion, Thurkill himself and the forty ships of which he has defrauded his sovereign."], [718, "670 APPENDIX. We hear however nothing more of him till Swegen is dead. When Cnut goes back to Denmark, Thurkill stays in England (ii. i). His motives are described at length. He then (ii. 3) goes to Cnut with nine ships, leaving thirty in England, to make his peace with him (\"memor quod Sueino fecerat, et quod tune in terra absque licentia domini sui Cnutonis inconsulte remanserat, cum novem navibus earumque exercitu dominum suum requisivit, ut ei patefaceret quia non contra ejus salutem se recedente rernan serit\"), and to exhort him to a renewed invasion of England. Cnut accordingly comes, and Thurkill is his right hand man throughout the war with Eadmund. I do not know whether our Thurkill is the same as \" porkell Hasi,\" brother of Heming and son of Earl Strut-Harold, who accompanies Cnut to England in the Knytlinga Saga, c. 8 (John stone, 105). This may be the Heming of Florence, 1009. The history of Thurkill in our Chronicles seems to hang very well together. Patching it up from Thietmar, I infer that he embraced Christianity before the death of \u00c6lfheah, which he strove to hinder. He then took service under \u00c6thelred, and served him faithfully against Swegen. But I do not know how to cast aside the assertion of the Encomiast that Thurkill was prominent on Cnut's side during the war with Eadmund. Fabulous as are many of the details, this can hardly be mere invention. He may have changed sides when Eadric beguiled the Danes in the English service in 1015 (see above, p. 376), or after \u00c6thelred's death, at the Southampton election of Cnut. Thurkill married (see Florence, 1 021) an Englishwoman named Eadgyth. Lappenberg (ii. 197, 207) makes her the widow of Ulf cytel, therefore a daughter of \u00c6thelred. But the name of Ulfcytel's wife seems to have been Wulfhild (see above, p. 654, and Lappen berg, ii. 168), while Eadgyth the daughter of \u00c6thelred was certainly the wife of Eadric. I suspect that it was Eadric's widow whom Thurkill married. At the same time I cannot lay my hand on any authority for Thurkill's wife being a daughter of \u00c6thelred; but it is very likely, and such a connexion would account for Cnut's jealousy of him (see p. 415)."], [719, "WULFRIC SPOT. 671 NOTE 00. p. 347. Wulfric Spot. Wulfric appears in the Chronicles simply as \"Wulfric Leof wines sunu \" without any further description. So in Florence he is simply \"Wlfricus Leofwini filius.\" He signs a charter of 1002 (Cod. Dipl. vi. 146) as \"minister.\" In the confirmation of his will by \u00c6thelred (Cod. Dipl. iii. 33 2 ) he is described as \" nobilis progeniei minister Wlfricus.\" He and all the other men who were slain at Ringmere all come in the Chronicles under the head of \" feala oSera godra pegna.\" I should infer from this that he never held the rank of Ealdorman; but he is called \"consul\" by Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 753 C) and Bromton (X Scripts. 888). So the Burton Chronicle printed in the Monasticon, iii. 47, calls him \" illustris et pr\u00e6potens consul ac comes Merciorum Wulfricus Spott regali propinquus prosapi\u00e6.\" The Burton Annals however (Luard, Ann. Mon. i. 183) are satisfied with calling him \"quidam nobilis nomine Wlfricus cognomento Spot.\" He cannot possibly have been Ealdorman of all Mercia, and if he were a subor dinate Ealdorman of one of the shires in which his property lay, he could hardly fail to have been somewhere spoken of as \" dux \" or \" comes.\" Sir Francis Palgrave (ii. ccxciii.) suggests that he was Ealdorman of Lancaster, on the strength of his possession of lands between the Ribble and the Mersey. This comes from his will, which is printed in Cod. Dipl. vi. 147. But Lancashire, as a shire, is later than Domesday. The lands between Mersey and Ribble appear there as an appendage to Cheshire, while Lancaster is in Yorkshire. Wulfric's lands between the Ribble and the Mersey are left to \u00c6lfhelm and Wulfheah, no doubt the murdered Ealdor man and his son, to both of whom other bequests are made as well as to \u00c6lfhelm's other son Ufegeat. A fittle way on, he leaves lands \"\u00c6lfhelme minan meage,\" and he afterwards speaks of \"\u00c6lfhelm min brotSor.\" This may raise some question as to whether he is speaking of one \u00c6lfhelm or more. Sir Francis Palgrave (ii. ccxci.) makes Wulfric the son of the person called Leofric the Second, brother of Ealdorman Leofwine and uncle of the famous Earl Leofric. But I do not find this"], [720, "672 APPENDIX. even in the very mythical document on which his genealogical table is founded, and of which I shall have again to speak (see Appendix CCC). The Chronicles distinctly describe Wulfric as the son of Leofwine, that is, not the Ealdorman of that name, but one of the many Thegns who bore it. Thus in Cod. Dipl. iii. 322 (a charter signed by Wulfric himself), we have \"Leofwine dux,\" as distinguished from \"Leofwine minister;\" and the con firmation charter of Wulfric's own foundation is signed by \" Leofwine dux\" and by two several men described as \"Leofwine minister.\" It would seem from what I have just quoted that Wulfric was a brother of Earl \u00c6lfhelm, and the Burton Chronicle gives him another brother \"dux Alwinus,\" that is, \u00c6lfwine or \u00c6thelwine, two not uncommon names, both of which will be found among the signatures, as in Cod. Dipl. iii. 345-6, a document which, I may add, is signed by three Leof wines besides the Ealdorman. Wulfric also makes bequests to a daughter of Morkere and Ealdgyth who was his goddaughter (\" ic geann minre goddohtor Morcares and EaldgytSe (S\u00e6t lande\" etc.). He mentions only one child of his own, who is spoken of rather mysteriously, without any name, as \" my poor daughter\" (\" ic gean minre earman dehter\"), with a hint that there was something wrong about her. She is to hold the land only while she deserves it (\" hwile Se heo hit geearnian cann\"), and \u00c6lfhelm is appointed guardian both of her and of the land. The name of Wulfric's wife, according to the local Chronicle, was Ealhswith. The foundation of Burton took place, according to the local Chronicles, in 1 004, which is the year of the confirmation charter. Wulfric was buried within his own monastery, not however in the church, but in the cloister ; \" in claustro monasterii sui antedicti sub arcu lapideo juxta ostium ecclesi\u00e6 superioris\" (Mon. iii. 47). Ealhswith, who seems to have died before him, as she is not mentioned in the will, was also -buried in the cloister, \"juxta ostium ecclesi\u00e6 inferioris.\" It seems then that the cloister had one door into the choir and one door into the nave, that is to say, the ritual choir was west of the crossing. The first Abbot Wulfgeat and his monks came from Winchester; he is said to have lived till 1026, but I doubt whether he signs any charters."], [721, "THE TAKING OF CANTERBURY. 673 NOTE PP. p. 352 The Taking of Canterbury and the Martyrdom of \u00c6lfheah. Of the siege of Canterbury and the martyrdom of \u00c6lfheah \u2014 the Alphege of hagiology \u2014 we have four distinct accounts. That in the Chronicles of course claims the first place. It was written before 1023, as it speaks of \u00c6lfheah's body being still at Saint Paul's and working miracles there, whereas it was translated to Canterbury in 1023. The witness of the Chronicles I of course accept unhesitatingly. And next to it I am inclined to place the narrative in Thietmar of Merseburg, which he heard when it was fresh from the lips of an Englishman named Sewald. He gives a minute account of the martyrdom, which differs a good deal from the popular version, but which falls in very well with the account in the Chronicles, contradicting it in nothing, but explaining it on one or two points. But, oddly enough, \u00c6lfheah is called Dunstan, a strange mistake to have been made by a contemporary, even though a foreigner, but one which shows how great was the fame of Dunstan, and how small the fame of \u00c6lfheah, in Christendom generally. There is also the Life of \u00c6lfheah by Osbern in Anglia Sacra, ii. 122. This is a mere piece of hagiology, in the common style of such lives, and it contains many statements which are untrue or impossible. It is in fact valuable only as affording practice in the art of unra velling the component elements of a romantic story. But the remarkable thing is that the fourth narrative, that of Florence, departs in several important points from the Chronicles and copies either from Osbern, or, what is more likely, from some third source from which Osbern also copied. Florence's knowledge and good sense kept him from repeating any of Osbern's grosser absurdities, but he has not improved his narrative by introducing several details which cannot be reconciled with the Chronicles. Simeon simply copies Florence ; Henry of Huntingdon follows the Chronicles, with some slight touches from Florence. The Chronicles (ion) describe the whole event in detail, but they give us only a picture of plunder and captivity, without any vol. 1. xx"], [722, "674 APPENDIX. mention of slaughter. The Archbishop and the other persons spoken of and a further countless number of clerks and laymen, men and women, were made prisoners (\"hi p\u00e6r genamon inne ealle pa gehadodan men and weras and wif ; p\u00e6t w\u00e6s unasecgendlic \u00e6nigum men hu micel p\u00e6s folces w\u00e6s\"). The word \"genamon\" which is applied to the mass of the people is the same word which is applied to the Archbishop, who was not put to death till long after, and to others who we know were not put to death at all. The Chronicles then go on to say how the Danes stayed in the city as long as they would, and when they had searched it thoroughly went to their ships (\"tSa hi h\u00e6fdon }?a buruh ealle asmeade, wendon him pa to scypan\"). Then follows a short poem lamenting the captivity of \u00c6lfheah and the wretchedness of the city ; but there is not a word to imply any general massacre. Neither is there anything to imply such a massacre in the shorter narrative of Thietmar. But in Osbern (Aug. Sacr. ii. 136, 137) and Florence we get a soul-harrowing account of every possible horror. Men are slaughtered, burned, thrown from the walls, tortured in hor rible ways. Women are dragged by their hair and thrown into the fire. Children are tossed on spears or crushed under the wheels of waggons. The whole ends with a systematic decima tion of the surviving adult males. By decimation is here meant the slaying, not of one out of ten, but of nine out of ten. This process leaves their lives to four monks and eight hundred laymen. If this is any clew to the population of Canterbury, the monks of the two minsters must have been fewer, and the general population much larger, than one would have expected. The metropolis of England must have gone down, relatively at least, since the eleventh century. These stories cannot be accepted in the teeth of the speaking silence of the Chroniclers. The narrative of these last is so minute and so pathetic that they could hardly have failed to dwell on the massacre if any massacre had taken place. No doubt some lives were lost ; a city was not likely to be taken, least of all by Danes in that age, without the loss of some fives. And here would be material enough for rhetorical hagiologists to work up into the picture given us by Osbern, into which they of course brought in all the horrors that they had ever heard of anywhere. The reader will perhaps not be inclined to set much store by"], [723, "THE MARTYRDOM OF \u00c6LFHEAH. 675 the authority of Osbern, if he knows the kind of story with which he (ii. 132) introduces the siege. One of the brothers of Eadric, a man \"lubricus et superbus\" like Brihtric, perhaps Brihtric himself, stirs up the wrath of the thegns of Kent by falsely accusing them to the King, and thereby procuring the confiscation of the estates of many of them. For these misdeeds they kill him and burn his house. Then Eadric, whom the King had made ruler over the whole realm (\"totius imperii sui pr\u00e6fectum statuerat\"), calls on the King to chastise them. The parts of Eadward and Godwine in a later story are thus transposed. \u00c6thelred refuses to inflict any punishment on the Kentish thegns, affirming the wrong-doer to have been rightfully slain (\"jure peremptum\"). Eadric then takes the law into his own hands ; he collects ten thousand men, who are described as being \" optime armati,\" and invades Kent at their head. The Kentish men however resist valiantly, and the expedition fails. He then leagues himself with the Danes (\" Danorum conciliabula expetit\") and exhorts them to attack, not Kent only, but the whole of Britain (\"ad totius Britanni\u00e6 fines invadendos\"). He describes the nakedness of the land, how the King \u2014 at the age of forty-two \u2014 was worn out with years, how the princes and people were all sunk in sloth and luxury. All this happens at a time when Swegen is already dead, and when Thurkill has seemingly suc ceeded to his power (see above, p. 654). So Eadric and Thurkill agree to divide the kingdom. Eadric is to take the East Angles, seemingly in addition to his Mercian government, and the Danes are to take the North (\"regnum post victoriam \u00e6qua sorte dividendum se Orientalibus Anglis principari, illos vero aquilone potiri\"). Eadric now joins the Danes in the siege of Canterbury. Thurkill is not personally mentioned, but Eadric presently vanishes from the stage, without any explanation. It might not be hard to resolve this fable into its component parts ; it is even pos sible that Eadric's attack on the metropolitan city of England is really borrowed from his capture of the metropolitan city of Wales. A point now arises as to the traitorous churchman who betrayed the city. It is not quite clear whether there were two \u00c6lfm\u00e6rs or one (see Hook, Lives of Archbishops, i. 466). The Chronicles X x 3"], [724, "APPENDIX. 676 seem to distinguish \u00c6lfm\u00e6r the traitor from \u00c6lfm\u00e6r the Abbot ; and Florence distinguishes the traitor as \" archidiaconus.\" Yet if \u00c6lfm\u00e6r the Abbot was a different man from \u00c6lfm\u00e6r the traitor, why should the Danes let Abbot \u00c6lfm\u00e6r go free, when the Archbishop and the rest were seized? I can only suggest, as seems also to have occurred to Dr. Hook, that the story is the reverse story of that of Cinna the conspirator and Cinna the poet, that the Danes mistook one \u00c6lfm\u00e6r for the other, and let go the innocent one by mistake. Abbot \u00c6lfm\u00e6r undoubtedly kept his abbey, and was afterwards raised to the bishopric of Dorset (W. Thorn, X Scripts. 1782; Hist, St. Aug. 23, 24). Thorn gives two dates, 1017 and 1022, and makes him resign his see and return to his abbey. He signs various charters of Cnut as Bishop ; he also appears as Abbot in a writ of Cnut (Cod. Dipl. iv. 9), addressed to him together with Archbishop Lyfing \u2014 therefore before 1020 \u2014 and Bishop Godwine; also as a witness to the marriage settlement of another Godwine (Cod. Dipl. iv. 10) along with King Cnut and Archbishop Lyfing. We find him also in the doubtful charter of 1023, in Cod. Dipl. iv. 23, 25, where he signs in company with \u00c6thelric, Bishop of Dorset, who otherwise seems to have left off signing in 1009. This \u00c6lfm\u00e6r must not be confounded with the contemporary \u00c6lfm\u00e6r, Bishop of the South-Saxons, whose signature also appears to the charter in iv. 25. The annals of his own abbey speak of \u00c6lfm\u00e6r with great reverence ; and, though ordinary traitors might be advanced, a churchman who had had an indirect share in the martyrdom of a saint would hardly meet with any favour at the hands of Cnut or of any one else. In describing the Archbishop's martyrdom, I have given no heed to the mythical details in Osbern, but I have formed my narrative from the Chroniclers and Thietmar. There is no con tradiction between the two accounts, but each fills up gaps in the other. Thus the statement that \u00c6lfheah first promised a ransom and then refused to pay it comes from Thietmar ; this explains the whole story, which otherwise is hardly intelligible. We thus see, what otherwise we do not clearly see, both why the Danes kept \u00c6lfheah so long in bonds, and why they were so bitterly enraged against him when he finally refused to pay. And we"], [725, "THE MARTYRDOM OF \u00c6LFHEAH. 677 can easily see why this part of the story should be left out, as tending somewhat to lessen the martyr's glory, while it is not easy to see why any one should invent or imagine it. Florence makes the Danes demand a ransom of the Archbishop on one Saturday, and tell him that, if he does not pay it, he shall be killed on the next Saturday (\"necem ejus usque ad aliud sabbatum protelant\"). He seems to connect the demand with the late vote of the Witan rather than with any promise on the part of \u00c6lfheah himself. The intercession of Thurkill comes from Thietmar; it falls in exactly with his conduct directly after. The words put into his mouth imply that he was already a Christian, which he certainly was, and a zealous one, before long. William of Malmesbury, the consistent persecutor of Thurkill, must be uttering mere calumnies when he says that he was \" incentor ut lapidaretur archiepiscopus.\" I accept from Florence the name and motive of the Dane Thrim or Thrum, who cleft the Archbishop's head. The Chronicles simply men! ion the fact. \" Drim miles,\" \" Drym dux,\" \" Drim eorl\" is a signature attached to more than one charter of Cnut (Cod. Dipl. iv. 17, 23, 25). The documents are suspicious; the title of Earl is specially suspicious. But no one would have invented a signature of Thrim, unless he had seen it attached to some genuine document. Lappenberg (ii. 177 Thorpe) has some good remarks on the impossibility of Osbern's general story, though he accepts his account of the horrors at Canterbury. Mr. St. John (ii. 30) amusingly takes Lappenberg to task for \" misinterpreting Florence and the Saxon Chronicle.\" The truth is that Lappenberg did not misinterpret anything, but that Mr. St. John failed to consult Thietmar, though Lappenberg gave him the reference. Sir Francis Palgrave, when he wrote his small history (p. 297), swallowed the whole tale about Eadric and his brother. M. de Bonnechose (ii. 17) has much to tell us about \"un chef farouche nomme Turchtill,\" but he does not take him to Canterbury. As Thietmar's account of the martyrdom is well worth reading, and as his work is much less accessible than most of my authorities, I transcribe it in full ; \"Percepi quoque a relatu pr\u00e6dicti hominis Sewaldi factum miserabile ac idclrco niemorabile, quod perfida Northmannorum"], [726, "678 APPENDIX. manus, duce ad hoc Thurkilo, Cantuari\u00e6 civitatis egregium antis titem, Dunsten nomine, cum c\u00e6teris caperent, et vinculis et inedia ac ineffabili p\u0153na, more suo nefando, constringerent.

That Swegen was acknowledged as King over England seems to be beyond doubt. The Chronicles (1013) say, \"And eall peodscipe hine h\u00e6fde pa for fulne cyning.\" So Florence; \"Ab omni Anglorum populo rex, si jure queat rex vocari, qui fere cuncta tyrannice faciebat, et appellabatur et habebatur.\" So Henry"], [727, "THE KINGSHIP AND DEATH OF SWEGEN. 679 of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 754 D) ; \" Suain vero ab omni populo habebatur pro rege;\" and again, \" Suain jam rex Anglorum.\" So, among later writers, Roger of Wendover (i. 447), \"Regem Angli\u00e6 se jussit appellari;\" and Bromton (X Scripts. 892), \" Swanus jam rex Anglorum factus.\" William of Malmesbury (ii. 177) loses himself in fine writing; \" tota jam Anglia in clientelam illius inclinata.\" On the other hand the English writers are specially fond of giving Swegen the name of Tyrant, a name, it must be remem bered, which still keeps the meaning which became familiar in the third century (see p. 137), that of \" usurper \" or \"pretender.\" We have already seen Florence use the adverb \" tyrannice,\" and under the year 1014 he begins the account of Swegen's death with the words, \"Suanus tyrannus, post innumerabilia et crudelia mala, qu\u00e6 vel in Anglia vel in aliis terris gesserat, ad cumulum su\u00e6 damnationis,\" &c. So William of Malmesbury (ii. 179), rhetorically describing the evil case of England during Swegen's occupation, says, \"H\u00e6sitabatur totis urbibus quid fieret; si pararetur rebellio, assertorem non haberent ; si eligeretur subjectio, placido rectore carerent. Ita private et public\u00e6 opes ad naves cum obsidibus deportabantur, quod non esset ille dominus legitimus, sed tyrannus atrocissimus.\" This is developed by Roger of Wendover (i. 448); \" Swanus . . . tyrannus nequissimus . . . evidenter apparet ipsum naturalem non esse dominum [cyne-hlaford] sed tyrannum. H\u00e6sitabat populus quid faceret, quia, si bellum qu\u00e6reret, ductorem non haberet, si subjeetionem eligeret, tyrannum rectorem haberet.\" The technical and the rhetorical sense of the word are struggling throughout. It will be seen at once that the former set of passages are much more distinct than the latter, which are intelligible only on the supposition that something happened, just as in the cases of Cnut and William, which at least passed for a regular election. Florence's scruple about calling Swegen \" rex \" seems of itself to imply that he had some kind of formal claim to the title. But I imagine that he was never crowned. The remarkable words of the Chroni cles that \" all the people held him for full King \" almost seem to imply that in strictness he was not full King. This would be exactly the position of a King elected but not crowned. No one hints at a coronation, except perhaps the Encomiast, who tells us"], [728, "APPENDIX. 680 (i. 5), \" Ubi jam s\u00e6pedictus rex tota Anglorum patria est inthroni zatus, et ubi jam pene illi nemo restitit, pauco supervixit tempore, sed tamen illud tantillum gloriose.\" But if Swegen had been solemnly crowned and anointed, his panegyrist would hardly have contented himself with so vague a word as \" inthronizatus.\" Florence again (1013) mentions only Ealdormen and thegns as joining in the submission to Swegen, while in the election of Cnut in 1016 he distinctly speaks of Bishops and Abbots as taking a share. And their absence seems implied in a statement of William of Malmesbury (ii. 177), which, though his narrative is evidently inaccurate in many points, is worth notice. This is that \u00c6thelred (p. 361), before he crossed into Normandy, held a meeting of Bishops and Abbots, as being the only people who still clave to him. \" Abbates et episcopos, qui nee in tali necessitate domi num suum deserendum putarent, in hanc convenit sententiam.\" This at once brings us to the problem of Swegen's religion. There seems no reason to doubt the account of his early baptism, his apostasy, his rebellion against his father. The English and German writers seem to know nothing of any reconversion. With Thietmar, for instance, a writer absolutely contemporary, who wrote while the events of 1016 were the last news of the day (see vii. 27, 28 ; Pertz, iii. 848), Swegen is to the end the \"immitis Danorum rex\" (vii. 26) and \" Suennus persecutor\" (28). But the Danish chroniclers assert a repentance and reconversion. So the Chronicle of Eric (Langebek, i. 158) mentions the baptism of Harold Blaatand and the parricidal war of Swegen, without however mentioning Swegen's early baptism. Thus we read how Swegen \" de regno expulsus, tandem ad Christi fidem conversus, baptizatus est et mox, Deo favente, regnum suum recepit.\" So the Chronicle of Roskild (i. 376); \" Christianis valde iuimicus, quos etiam finibus suis expelli pr\u00e6cepit . . . tandem Deum cognovit post flagella, quern c\u0153pit qu\u00e6rere eique credere.\" AVe then read how he founded churches and brought Bishop Bernhard from Norway into Scania. So Saxo first (186) describes his persecu tions, and then (188) tells of his conversion, how he was \"fortun\u00e6 s\u00e6vitia ad amplectendam religionis caritatem adactus.\" He too places Swegen's baptism at this stage ; \" Quinetiam cunctis circa se rite peractis, lavacri usum promptissimo religionis tenore per cepit.\" He then, as well as the Roskild Chronicle, goes on to"], [729, "THE KINGSHIP AND DEATH OF SWEGEN. 681 tell of the churches and bishoprics which he founded, and especially how he brought the English Bishop Bernhard from Norway to Lund. But Adam (ii. 53) attributes all this to Cnut. Saxo becomes (191) almost affecting on Swegen's piety in his old age ; \" Sveno senilis anim\u00e6 laboribus fessus, divinis rebus infatigabilem ultimi temporis curam tribuit,\" &c. So the Encomiast (i. 5) tells us of the good and Christian advice, as well as the instructions in the art of government, which he gave to his son Cnut before his death ; \" Pr\u00e6sciens igitur dissolutionem sui corporis imminere, filium suum Cuutonem quem secum habuit advocat, sese viam univers\u00e6 carnis ingrediendum indicat. Cui dum multa de regni gubernaculo multaque hortaretur de Christianitatis studio, Deo gratias, illi, virorum dignissimo sceptram commisit regale.\" When we balance the two sets of authorities, I think we shall hardly be inclined to reject the implied witness of the German and English writers in favour either of a careless writer like Saxo or of an abandoned flatterer like the Encomiast. The English legend of his death implies a kind of half belief in the power of Saint Eadmund which is really not unlikely in such a case. It has a kind of parallel in a story of a Danish chief, perhaps the Guthrum-\u00c6thelstan who was found making a vow to Saint Patrick. (See Dr. Todd's Introduction to the Wars of the Gaedhill and the Gaill, lxiv, lxv, xciii.) We have the like con tradictions as to Swegen's death. The Encomiast goes on to tell us how he prayed his son that his body might be taken to Denmark, and makes incidentally an admission of some importance. Swegen would not be buried in England ; \" noverat enim quia pro invasione regni illis odiosus erat populis.\" He then dies; \"Nee multo post postrema natur\u00e6 persolvit debita, animam remittendo c\u0153lestibus, terr\u00e6 autem reddendo membra.\" Saxo also (191) makes him die very quietly, perhaps in the odour of sanctity ; \" Omni humana concussione vacuus, in ipso perfectissim\u00e6 vit\u00e6 fulgore decessit.\" The English story, as it is told by Florence, I have given in the text. The Chronicle records only that \" he ended his days.\" William of Malmesbury (ii. 179) had heard more stories than one ; \" pervasor . . . ambiguum qua morte, vitam effudit.\" He then goes on to tell the story in a form slightly different from that of Florence : Swegen seems to have reached Bury and to be actually harrying the lands of Saint"], [730, "682 APPENDIX. Eadmund ; \" Dicitur quod terram Sancti Edmundi depopulanti martyr idem per visum apparuerit, leniterque de miseria conventum insolentiusque respondentem in capite perculerit, quo dolore tactum in proximo, ut pr\u00e6dictum est, obiisse.\" The Knytlinga Saga, c. 6 (Johnstone, 89), makes Swegen's death sudden, but says signi ficantly that he died in his bed ; \" urdo pau tidindi par, at Sveinn konungr Haralldsson vard braddaudr um nott i 'reckio sinni.\" The tale then goes on to speak of the legend as one told by English men ; \" Oc er pat sogn Enskra manna, at Eadmundr hinn helgi hafi drepit hann, med peima h\u00e6tti sem hinn helgi Mercurius drap Julianum niding.\" There is no mention of Saint Mercurius in Florence, but the comparison between Julian and Swegen, accord ing to the English notion of Swegen, is obvious enough, and the name \"niding\" (=the English \"nicSing\") applied to Julian is worth notice. In after times Orderic (518 A) attributes the death of Swegen to Saint Eadmund, but without details ; \" A sancto Edmundo jussu Dei peremptus est.\" In Orderic's eyes Swegen is still \" vesanus idololatra.\" The same story is told of the Bulgarian King Kalojohannes, who died before Thessalonica in 1207. He was smitten by Saint Demetrios, just as Swegen was by Saint Eadmund. See the Notes to Georgios Akropolites, p. 236 ed. Bonn, and Jirecek, Geschichte der Bulgaren, p. 242. There is another tale of the same kind in p. 246. As for Swegen's body, Thietmar (vii. 28) says, in a marked but not very clear way ; \" hujus proles, multum in omnibus patris santes, dilecti genitoris corpus delatum flebiliter suscipiunt et tumulant, et quidquid dedecoris patri suimet ingeri ab Anglis propositum est, paratis navibus ulcisci studebant.\" This must be taken in connexion with the significant remark of the Encomiast quoted in the last paragraph. He presently goes on (ii. 3) to tell us how an English lady (\" qu\u00e6dam matronarum Anglicarum \")\u2014 had Swegen found his Eadgyth Swanneshals in England ? \u2014 dug up the body which had been buried in England (\" assumpto corpore Sueini regis sua in patria sepulti \"), embalmed it, and carried it in a ship to Denmark. She then summoned Cnut and Harold to come and bury their father in the place which he had himself appointed. They come accordingly and bury him honourably in the tomb which he had himself made in the minster of the Holy Trinity of his own rearing (\" honorificentiusque illud in monasterio"], [731, "THE SERMON OF WULFSTAN. 683 in honore sanct\u00e6 Trinitatis ab eodem rege constructo, in sepulcro quod sibi paraverat recondunt \"). From the Saga of Olaf Trygg vesson (Johnstone, 101), which says nothing about the manner of Swegen's death, we find that this minster is Roskild'. \" Sveirn konungr andadist i Englandi oc f\u00e6rdo Danir han til Danmerkur oc grofo pan i Hroiskeldo hia fbdr sinum.\" The English lady is here left out. NOTE RR. p. 369. The Sermon of Wulfstan or Lupus. There is, I suppose, no question that the person affectedly described as \" Lupus \" is really Archbishop Wulfstan. And I have little doubt in fixing the discourse to the year 1014. This is the date given in the heading of one of the manuscripts, while another has 1008. In an insertion in the text itself the discourse is said to have been delivered four years before the death of \u00c6thelred. \" Dis w\u00e6s on \u00c6pelredes cyninges dagum gediht, feower geara f\u00e6ce \u00e6r he fort5ferde.\" This would at first sight look as if the right year were 1012. But the discourse itself contains a passage which shows that it must be later than \u00c6thelred's flight in 1013. The speaker says (p. 102) that the two most shameful deeds that can be done are to compass one's lord's death and to drive him out of the land. Each of these crimes, he says, has been done in England (\"\u00e6gcSer is geworden on tSysum earde\"); Eadward has been murdered ; we expect the speaker to add that \u00c6thelred has been driven out ; but either some words have been lost in the text or else Wulfstan left it to his hearers to fill up the gap for themselves. But in any case the passage would have no force or meaning at any time before \u00c6thelred's flight. And I am not sure that it is not possible, by a little chronological subtlety, to reconcile the date of 10 1 4 with the other date of four years before the death of \u00c6thelred. The year begins at different times in different reckon ings. In a chronology which made the year begin at Lady-day, \u00c6thelred's death on April 23, 1016 would come in a year 1016 1017, while, if the sermon was preached before March 25, in a year 1013-1014, this might possibly be called the fourth year before"], [732, "684 APPENDIX. the other. It may no doubt have been delivered just at the end of what we should call the year 1013, but the matter of the discourse agrees so well with the matter of the decrees of the Gemot of 1 01 4 that one is strongly tempted to connect the two. It cannot in any case belong to 1012. See p. 361. It is remarkable how little strictly historical information the speech gives us. Indeed the one historical fact which it mentions is wrong, as Wulfstan says that the body of Eadward the Martyr was burned (\" Eadweard man forr\u00e6de and sySSan acwealde and \u00e6fter pam forb\u00e6rnde \"). But it is none the less valuable as a picture of the wretchedness of the times, a picture which goes very much into detail in its general descriptions, though without men tioning the names of persons or places. I have summed up most of the chief points in the text. Among the passages which are most worthy of notice are those which relate to the slave-trade. The orator first says (p. 100) ; \" Earme men syndon sare beswicene and hreowlice besyrwde and ut of pysurn earde wide gesealde swybe unforworhte fremdum to gewealde, and cradolcild geSeowode purh w\u00e6lhieowe unlaga for lytelre SyfSe wide gynd Sas peode. And freo riht fornumene and Sr\u00e6hiht genyrwde and \u00e6lmesriht gewanode.\" The other passage (102) says; \" Eac we witan full georne hw\u00e6r seo yrmS gewearS p\u00e6t f\u00e6der gesealde his beam wiS weorSe, and beam his modor, and broSor sealde oSerne fremdum to gewealde ut of Sisse Seode.\" Slavery also brought its own punishment in other ways. The slaves often joined the heathen invaders (\"Seh pr\u00e6la hwylc hlaforde \u00e6thl\u00e6pe and of cristendome to wicinge weorSe \") ; sometimes a thegn's slave led his own master into slavery (\" and oft pr\u00e6l tS\u00e6ne Segen Se \u00e6r w\u00e6s his hlaford, cnyt swySe f\u00e6ste and wyrcS him to pr\u00e6le, Surh Godes yrre\"). The lustful excesses of Englishmen, several of whom would hire a harlot in common (p. 102), were avenged by the outrages of the invaders on the wives and daughters of English thegns (\" and oft tyne oSSe twelfe, \u00e6lc after oSrum, scendaS and tawiaS to bismore micelum S\u00e6s Segenes cwenan, and hwilum his dohtor oSSe nyd magan ; p\u00e6r he onlocaS pa l\u00e6te hine sylfne rancue and rincne and genoh godne \u00e6r p\u00e6t gewurSe.\" p. 103. Cf. Herod, viii. 33). Two or three pirates drove all the people from sea to sea (\" oft twegen s\u00e6men ooSe Sry hwilum"], [733, "THE CHILDREN OF \u00c6THELRED. 685 drifaS Sa drafe Cristenra manna fram s\u00e6 to s\u00e6 ut Surh S\u00e6s Seode gewelede tog\u00e6dere.\" p. 103). Lastly, there is an apparent allusion to the capture of Canterbury and captivity of \u00c6lfheah and others, which certainly falls in better with my notion of that event than with the notion of a general massacre. \"We hym gyldaS singallice, and by us hynaS d\u00e6gh wamlice: hy hergiaS and hy b\u00e6rnaS, rypaS and r\u00e6pialS and to scipe l\u00e6dciS.\" (p. 103). This almost sounds like the poem in the Chronicles about \u00c6lfheah. One might almost have thought that the speech was made during the time of \u00c6lfheah's im prisonment, but the manifest allusion to the flight of \u00c6thelred forbids this. NOTE SS. p. 372. The Children of \u00c6thelred. The list of the children of \u00c6thelred, among the genealogies given by Florence (i. 275, Thorpe), is manifestly imperfect. He is there said to have had by his first wife \u00c6lfgifu, the daughter of Ealdorman \u00c6thelberht, three sons, Eadmund, Eadwig, and \u00c6thelstan, and one daughter, Eadgyth. He then mentions the two sons of Emma, \u00c6lfred and Eadward, but does not mention Emma's daughter Godgifu. This list is copied by R. Higden (270) and Knighton (2314), only changing \u00c6lfgifu daughter of \u00c6thel berht into \u00c6thelgifu daughter of Ecgberht. The three sons of the first marriage here mentioned are those who survived to play a part in the history, but it appears from the charters that \u00c6lfgifu, if that was her name, was the mother of several other sons. I quote the doubtful charters along with the genuine ones, as this is the kind of point in which one who either forged a charter or wrote down a lost charter from memory would be sure to reproduce what he had seen in genuine documents. Thus in a doubtful charter of 990 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 250) we have the signatures of \u00c6thelstan, Ecgberht or Ecgbriht, Eadmund, Eadred, Eadwig, Eadgar, and Eadward. All sign with the title of \" clito,\" which is of course equivalent to \u00c6theling. In iii. 270, we have \u00c6thelstan, Ecgbriht, Eadmund, and Eadred, all with the title of \" regis filius.\" At iii. 308, a seemingly genuine charter of 998, we have the \" clitones \""], [734, "APPENDIX. 686 \u00c6thelstan, Ecgbriht, Eadmund, Eadred, Eadwig. In iii. 314 (999) we have \u00c6thelstan and Eadred. In iii. 321 (1001) \u00c6thel stan, Ecgbriht, Eadmund, Eadred, Eadwig, and Eadgar ; and the same list in iii. 325 (1002). At iii. 330, in a doubtful charter of 1004, \u00c6thelstan, as the eldest son, signs on behalf of his brothers. In a genuine charter of the same year (iii. 334) we have the same list which I have already quoted with the omission of the name Eadred. In vi. 142 (1002) we have the same list with the name of Eadred. In another of the same year, vi. 146, the list stands, \u00c6thelstan, Ecgbriht, Eadmund, Eadward, Eadwig, Eadgar. In vi. 153 (1005) the list is \u00c6thelstan, Ecgbriht, Eadmund, Eadric, Eadwig, Eadgar, Eadward. In 1007 (vi. 156) it stands, \u00c6thel stan, Eadmund, Eadred, Eadwig, Eadgar, Eadward. In another of the same year (vi. 159) \u00c6thelstan signs on behalf of all his brothers (\" Ego \u00c6Selstanus filius regis cum fratribus meis clitoni bus adplaudens consensi \"). In a doubtful charter of 1013 (vi. 166) the signatures are \u00c6thelstan, Eadmund, Eadward, \u00c6lfred, and Eadwig, and in a genuine one of 1014 (vi. 169) we have Eadmund, Eadwig, Eadward, and \u00c6lfred. Lastly, in 10 15 (vi. 171) we have Eadmund and Eadward only. From all this it seems certain that \u00c6thelstan was the eldest son and Eadmund the third, the intermediate brother Ecgbriht dying, it would seem, about 1005. It now becomes an important point whether \u00c6thelstan was alive at the time of his father's death. This I shall discuss in another Note. His will (iii. 361), a very important document, of which I shall have to speak again, is witnessed by Eadmund, and contains bequests both to him and to Eadwig. We may perhaps also infer that Eadred was dead as well as Ecgbriht, and Eadric also, if the single signature of that name be not a mistake. But from the mention of \" brothers \" (\" fratres \") of Eadmund as surviving him (see page 405) one might be inclined to think that one at least of Eadmund's younger brothers, besides Eadwig, was alive at the beginning of 1 o 1 7 . For Cnut had much more reason to dread opposition from Eadmund's brothers of the whole blood than from the sons of Emma. And if \u00c6thelstan, Ecgbriht, and perhaps Eadred, were dead, Eadgar might be alive. There would also seem to have been an Eadward a son of the first marriage, as (to say nothing of the doubtful charter of 990, and of that of 984, mentioned below) Eadward the son of Emma could"], [735, "THE CHILDREN OF \u00c6THELRED. 687 not have signed in 1002, though he might in 1005, if the pen was held in the child's hand. If so, this elder Eadward doubtless died before the birth of his namesake. Of the daughters of the first marriage Florence mentions only Eadgyth the wife of Eadric. But we seem to have evidence enough for Wulfhild the wife of Ulfcytel (see p. 654) and for \u00c6lfgifu the wife of Uhtred (see p. 330). We also need a fourth daughter to account for the King's son-in-law \u00c6thelstan, who died in the battle of Ringmere (see p. 347). The mother of these children, as I have said, is cailed by Florence \u00c6lfgifu, the daughter of Ealdorman \u00c6thelberht. I can not however find any Ealdorman of that name. \u00c6thelred of Rievaux (X Scripts. 362, 372) calls her the daughter of Earl Thored (see p. 661). William of Malmesbury (ii. 179) professes ignorance of her name, and speaks of her birth as ignoble ; \" Erat iste Edmundus non ex Emma natus, sed ex quadam alia quam fama obscura recondit.\" He then goes on to magnify Eadmund, saying that he was one \" qui patris ignaviam, matris ignobilitatem, virtute sua probe premeret si Parc\u00e6 parcere nossent.\" Roger of Wendover speaks nearly to the same effect in i. 451. I do not understand Lappenberg's note (431, ii. 163 Thorpe), where he quotes the Scholiast on Adam of Bremen as calling her \" Afficud,\" which he takes to be \u00c6lfl\u00e6d. Mr. Thorpe (Dipl. Angl. 542) further identifies her with the \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d whose will he has there printed. But, at least in Pertz' edition (ii. 51, Schol. 39), the name is \" Afelrud,\" and she is described as the step-mother of Eadward the son of Eadgar, that is, of course, \u00c6lfthryth. I would rather identify her with the \u00c6lfgifu whose will appears in Cod. Dipl. iii. 359. This cannot belong to \u00c6lfgifu -Ernma, as it speaks of her sister \u00c6lfwaru and her brother's wife \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d. (These three names again come together in the will of Wynfl\u00e6d, Cod. Dipl. iii. 293.) It reads to me like the will of a King's wife, yet it contains bequests not only to the \u00c6theling but to the Lady. Mr. Kemble gives it the date of 1012, and a bequest to Bishop \u00c6thelwold (1006-1014) shows that it cannot be far from that date. Severaf questions arise out of this. Was \u00c6thelred's first wife divorced to make room for the Norman Lady ? Or was she only a mistress or Danish wife ? I do not think she is ever called \" regina,\" and \u00c6thelred of Rievaux seems pointedly to contrast her"], [736, "688 APPENDIX. with \" regina Emma.\" And again, were all these sons and daughters children of one mother ? There is a very strange charter (Cod. Dipl. iii. 204) which must be spurious or at least wrongly dated, as \u00c6thelred, born in 969, cannot have had six sons in 984 ; but the signatures are worth notice from their veiy strangeness. They run thus, \" \u00c6Selstan,\" \" Eadgar clito,\" \" Ead mund frater pr\u00e6dicti clitonis,\" \" Eadweard clito,\" \" Eadward filius regis,\" \" Eadwig frater clitonum.\" This does not read like a list of sons of one mother. Lappenberg (u. s.) makes \u00c6thelred marry in his seventeenth year, but I have not found his authority. At any rate his third son Eadmund cannot have been born, as Roger of Wendover (i. 422) tells us, in 981, when \u00c6thelred was twelve years old. It should again be noticed that in the will of \u00c6thelstan (Cod. Dipl. iii. 363) there is no mention of his mother, living or dead, and that he speaks of his grandmother \u00c6lfthryth as having reared him (\" \u00c6lf SrySe minre ealdormodor Se me afedde \"). \u00c6lfthryth was living in 999, as appears by her signature in Cod. Dipl. iii. 314 ; perhaps later, as she (Cod. Dipl. iii. 353) addresses a writ to Archbishop \u00c6lfric who lived to 1006. The young \u00c6thelings and their grandmother are again spoken of in the will of Wynfl\u00e6d (Cod. Dipl. iii. 292), which, as mentioning Archbishop Sigeric, comes between 990 and 994. But here again is no mention of their mother, unless she lurks among the cloud of witnesses, \"\u00c6lfwaru, \u00c6lfgifu, and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d,\" names which we have just before seen in company. I am afraid therefore that I must leave the first marriage of \u00c6thelred shrouded in some obscurity. The Scandinavian writers cut the knot by giving all \u00c6thelred's children to Emma. Thus in the Knytlinga Saga (Johnstone, 130) Cnut is called Eadmund's step-father, and again (139) Emma is distinctly called the mother of Eadmund and his brothers. So Snorro (ib. 97), speaking of the Norman Dukes, says expressly that Emma, daughter of Richard and sister of Dukes William and Robert, whomever he may mean, married \u00c6thelred, and was mother of Eadmund, Ead ward the Good, Eadwig, and Eadgar (\" Eadmundr oc Eadvardr hinn godi, Eatvigr oc Eatgeir\"). It is odd that the last two names should have been remembered. So Thietmar (Pertz, vii. 28) mistakes \u00c6thelstan and Eadmund"], [737, "THE ELECTIONS OF CNUT AND EADMUND. 689 for children of Emma. Walter Map, on the other hand (De Nugis, 203), confounds the sons of Emma with their nephews, the sons of Eadmund and Ealdgyth. At least Eadward and \u00c6lfred reached Normandy (see p. 361) only by the help of the Hungarian King. Cnut, having married Emma, tries in vain to find her sons ; \" Rapuerat enim eos, ut pr\u00e6paravit Altissimus, a tumultu et turbine miles quidam, et clam in cymba positos in portum impulit, et regiis ornatos insigniis cum brevi cognitionis et cognationis eorum dispositioni divin\u00e6 supposuit. Illi autem in die secundo a mercatoribus Pannoni\u00e6 vagientes inventi sunt, et ab Hungarorum rege redempti, et ad avunculum suum ducem [Normannorum sc] remissi.\" This story is one of a whole class of tales of persons exposed in boats. See Historical Essays, First Series, p. 1 3. NOTE TT. p. 381. The Elections of Cnut and Eadmund. Cnut may be said to have been three times elected to the crown. The first time is in 1014, on the death of his father Swegen (see p. 367), when the election was made wholly by the Danish fleet, and when the Witan of England passed their vote for the restoration of \u00c6thelred. But on the death of \u00c6thelred he seems to have been more regularly elected by a large portion at least of the English Witan. The fact is not stated in the Chronicles, but it is distinctly affirmed by Florence, and the words of the Chronicles (1016), if carefully studied, will perhaps be found to give the statement of Florence a negative confirmation. It is only the latest and least authoritative version of the Chronicles, the Canterbury manuscript, which states the election of Eadmund to have been an act of the Witan of all England ; \" And \u00e6fter his [\u00c6Selredes] ende ealle Angeleynnes witan gecuron Eadmund to cinge.\" The three other Chroniclers seem carefully to mark the act as more partial and local. They say only, \"And pa \u00e6fter his ende ealle Sa witan pa on Lundene w\u00e6ron and seo burhwaru gecuron Eadmund to cyninge.\" When we remember that London was the only place which still held out, and that Wessex itself was in the power of Cnut, we shall probably have little difficulty in accepting the account in Florence. His words are as follows ; \"Cujus [\u00c6gelredi] post mortem, episcopi, abbates, duces, et VOL. I. Y y"], [738, "690 APPENDIX. quique nobiliores Angli\u00e6, in unum congregati, pari consensu, in dominum et regem sibi Canutum elegere, et ad eum in Suthamtonia venientes, omnemque progeniem regis \u00c6gelredi coram illo ab negando repudiantes, pacem cum eo composuere, et fidelitatem illi juravere ; quibus et ille juravit quod, et secundum Deum et secundum seculum, fidelis esse vellet eis dominus. At cives Lun donienses, et pars nobilium, qui eo tempore consistebant Lundoni\u00e6, clitonem Eadmundum unanimi consensu in regem levavere.\" I accept then the double election, and there can be no doubt that the election of Eadmund was the earlier of the two. The Witan of his party were on the spot, while those who chose Cnut had to come together from various places to Southampton. The election of Eadmund also seems to have been followed by a coronation, while the election of Cnut answered rather to the submission made to William at Berkhampstead, between which and his coronation at Westminster some little time passed. Flo rence seems pointedly to exclude a coronation of Cnut, while, though he does not distinctly affirm, he seems rather to imply the ceremony in the case of Eadmund. For he immediately adds, \" qui solii regalis sublimatus culmine, intrepidus West-Saxoniam adiit sine cunctatione.\" And Eadmund's coronation in Saint Paul's by Lyfing appears in three later, but two of them very respectable, authorities. Ralph de Diceto, in his series of Archbishops of Canterbury (Ang. Sacr. ii. 683), says of Lyfing, \" Hie consecravit Edmundum Ferreum-Latus, et postmodum Cnutonem regem Daci\u00e6.\" So Bromton (904), \" Londonienses cum nonnulla parte procerum Edmundum filium regis Ethelredi in regem levaverunt, qui a Livingo Dorobemensi archiepiscopo apud Londonias con secratus est.\" And in the list of coronations in the Rishanger volume (426) we read, \"Anno grati\u00e6 millesimosexto-decimo, Londoniis, coronatio Edmundi Ferrei Lateris, filii regis Ethelredi, qui in eodem anno proditionaliter interfectus, Glastoni\u00e6 est sepultus. \"Anno grati\u00e6 millesimo septimo-decimo, Londoniis, coronatio Cnutonis regis, filii David. Hie vicesimo regni anno mortuus, apud Wyntoniam est humatus.\" I have no notion whatever why Swegen or Otto should be called David ; but these entries in Rishanger, though not contemporary, are not the obiter dicta of a man who is carelessly compiling a"], [739, "THE ELECTIONS OF CNUT AND EADMUND. 691 story, but the assertions of a man who is giving the results of his special inquiries into a special subject. As therefore there is no contemporary authority to set against them, and as they fit in with the slight indication in Florence, I accept them. Lyfing then was one of the Witan who were in London with Eadmund, and he performed the ceremony of Eadmund's royal consecration at once on his election. But Cnut remained un crowned till after his second or third election after the death of Eadmund. This was doubtless one reason among others why, in the agreement between Cnut and Eadmund, the Imperial dignity remained with the West-Saxon. It is worth noticing that both candidates were most likely chosen over the heads of their own elder brothers. Cnut clearly was so chosen at his first election by the Danish fleet. In choosing a suc cessor to Swegen in his conquered kingdom of England, Harold, who succeeded him in Denmark (see p. 366), was passed by in favour of his more promising brother. At the Southampton election Cnut was chosen on the same grounds on which William was afterwards chosen, because he was the conqueror, and a conqueror far more fully in possession of the conquered land than William was in December 1066. If Harold had any share in the war, he was altogether overshadowed by his brother. But was Eadmund the eldest sur viving son of \u00c6thelred ? We have seen in the last Note that he had two elder brothers, \u00c6thelstan and Ecgbriht. Of these there can be little doubt that Ecgbriht was dead, but the case is not so clear about \u00c6thelstan. One story, which I shall have to examine in the next Note, seems to hint that he took a part in the war of Cnut and Eadmund and died during its course. His will, of which I have already spoken and shall have to speak again, was made during his father's lifetime, but it does not follow that he died before his father. The point is an obscure one, but it is worth inquiring into, for to choose a younger brother over the head of an elder, though a perfectly legal measure, was a strong and unusual one. If it be the fact, it does equal honour to both brothers. The merits of Eadmund must have been great, if he was thus preferred to an elder brother, while no praise can be too great for the conduct of \u00c6thelstan in quietly accepting and loyally serving a younger brother thus chosen over his own head. Another question arises as to the ecclesiastical position of Cnut yy a"], [740, "692 APPENDIX. at the time of the. Southampton election. It is not very clear when Cnut was baptized; our notices on this point have to be sought for in rather out of the way places. In the Aqui tanian history of Ademar, iii. 55 (Pertz, iv. 140), we read, \"Rex Canotus de Danamarcha paganus, niortuo Adalrado rege An glorum, regnum ejus dolo cepit et reginam Anglorum in con jugium accepit, qu\u00e6 erat soror comitis Rotomensis Richardi, et factus Christianus utraque regna tenuit, et quoscumque potuit ex paganis de Danamarcha ad fidem Christi pertraxit.\" Another manuscript adds, \" Pater ejus paganus nomine Asquec solum reg num de Danamarca tenuit.\" \" Asquec \" as the name of Cnut's father seems at first sight as incomprehensible as the name David, but Pertz is doubtless right in hinting that it is a corruption of his nickname Tveski\u00e6g, \"Fork-beard,\" or, in plain English, Two shag. The religion of Swegen, as we have seen, is a problem, but the chances are certainly against his son being baptized in his infancy. One Danish Chronicler, as we have already seen (see p. 375), makes Cnut be baptized by Unwan, Archbishop of Bremen, in the middle of his war with \u00c6thelred; and this may seem to draw some confirmation from the statement of the Scholiast on Adam of Bremen, 38 (ii. 50); \" Knut, filius Suein regis, abjecto nomine gentilitatis, in baptismo Lambertus nomen accepit. Unde scriptum est in libro fraternitatis nostr\u00e6 Lambrecht rex Danorum, et Imma regina, et Knut filius eorum, devote se commendaverunt orationibus f rat rum Bremensium.\" If Cnut was baptized by the name of Lambert, he was none the less always called by his heathen name, just as his father was never known as Otto, nor Rolf as Robert. We also read in Osbern's tract on the Transla tion of Saint \u00c6lfheah (Ang. Sacr. ii. 144) that Archbishop \u00c6thel noth was \" regi [Cnutoni] propterea quod ilium sancto chrismate liVisset valde acceptus.\" This cannot refer to his coronation, which was not performed by \u00c6thelnoth, and it can hardly refer to his bap tism. I suspect therefore that it refers to confirmation, and that Cnut was confirmed at the time of the Southampton election. His case would thus he very like that of the elder Olaf (see above, p. 290), who was confirmed after a much earlier baptism at the time of his peace with \u00c6thelred. The Christianity of Cnut at the time of that election is plainly implied in the words of the oath put into his mouth by Florence."], [741, "THE ELECTIONS OF CNUT AND EADMUND. 693 The final accession of Cnut after the death of Eadmund forms the first entry in each of the four Chronicles under the year 1017 ; \" Her on Jiissum geare feng Cnut kyning to eallon Angeleynnes [Englalandes, Ab.] ryce.\" The Winchester Chronicle alone, in one of its short and occasional entries, says, \" Her Cnut wearS gecoren to kinge.\" The expression in the other four is probably chosen advisedly; for, as Cnut succeeded by virtue of the terms of the Olney compact, there was no need of any formal election. Flo rence, whose fuller account I have followed in the text, uses the words expressive of election only in a sort of incidental way; \" Ipse juraverunt illi quod eum regem sibi eligere vellent, eique humiliter obedire.\" What he chiefly insists on is the examination of the witnesses \u2014 false witnesses, as he says they were \u2014 to show that Cnut really was entitled to succeed under the compact. Flo rence divides the details of Cnut's accession between the two years 1016 and 1017; he might thus be thought to speak of two distinct assemblies; but as .there is no trace of more than one in the Chronicles, I am disposed to think that the two accounts are merely two narratives of the proceedings of the same Gemot, perhaps rather unskilfully borrowed from two sources. Florence begins the year on the first of January, and the ordinary session of a Midwinter Gemot, taking in the twelve daj's of Christmas, would really extend into both years. The coronation of Cnut, like the coronation of Harold, most likely took place on the feast of the Epiphany. We have seen that there is every reason to believe that the ceremony was performed in Saint Paul's by Archbishop Lyfing. The coronation, it must be remembered, would involve the eccle siastical election by clergy and people. See vol. iii. p. 627. How utterly the real story was forgotten, and above all how utterly the true position of Cnut at the time of his father's death passed out of his mind, is nowhere better shown than in the version of Walter Map (De Nugis, 202). The English, according to him, especially the Londoners, were so tired of \u00c6thelred that they sent for help to Cnut, who, it would seem, had already founded his Northern Empire. \" Erat ilia tempestate regum omnium ditissi mus et strenuissimus Dacorum rex Chnutus. Hie ab optimatibus Angli\u00e6 vocatus, et frequentibus epistolis illectus, non invitis sed invitantibus Anglicis et cum gaudio suscipientibus, cum exercitu nimio in Danesiam illapsus est, qu\u00e6 nunc usque dicitur a Dacis, ut"], [742, "APPENDIX. 694 aiunt, Danesia.\" (Where is \"Danesey?\") Presently, Cnut comes, \" ab invitatoribus suis Londoniensibus susceptus.\" NOTE VV. p. 383. The War of Cnut and Eadmund. The English narratives of this great year of battles agree well together on the whole, and I see no difficulty in accepting the story as it is given in them. The part played by Eadric is indeed hard to understand, but so is his career throughout, and I can see no ground for casting aside the unanimous witness of our authorities and placing any arbitrary conjecture in its stead. We have first the narrative in the Chronicles. The three elder versions agree together, with only the smallest verbal differences ; the later Can terbury Chronicle gives the story in an abridged shape ; Florence, William of Malmesbury, and Henry of Huntingdon, tell essentially the same story. Their versions are plainly grounded on the history in the Chronicles, seemingly with some help from contemporary songs. This is especially plain in Henry of Huntingdon. His narrative of this campaign, like his narrative of the campaign of Stamfordbridge (see vol. iii. p. 733), is a mere meagre abridgement till he reaches the battle of Assandun, when he lights up and gives a spirited account, which evidently comes from a ballad. In all these accounts, whether coming from Chroniclers or from minstrels, the treason of Eadric stands out distinctly. And it stands out no less distinctly in the account given from the Danish side by the author of the Encomium Emm\u00e6, of which I shall speak more presently. I will now mention a few points in detail, in which the English writers differ from one another, or which call for attention on any other ground. It is, I think, plain that Eadmund, on leaving London, was at once accepted by the West-Saxons, or such part of them as he had been able to reach before he was overtaken by Cnut at Penselwood. These would be the forces of Somerset, Dorset, Devonshire, and part of Wiltshire. This we gather from Florence's account of the battle of Sherstone. The Chronicle says distinctly, \" Eadmund"], [743, "THE WAR OF CNUT AND EADMUND. 695 cyng . . . gerad pa Westsexon, and him beah eall sole to.\" So Florence more fully, \" Intrepidus West-Saxoniam adiit sine cuncta tione, et ab omni populo magna susceptus gratulatione, su\u00e6 ditioni subegit earn citissime ; quibus auditis multi Anglorum populi magna cum festinatione illi se dederunt voluntarie.\" No doubt, as soon as Eadmund's standard was once raised, volunteers would drop in from all parts which were not actually occupied by a Danish military force. The expressions of Florence implying something like a conquest, though of course a perfectly willing conquest, of Wessex by Eadmund will be understood if we remember that Cnut was actually the acknowledged King, by the choice of all the Witan who were not actually within the walls of London. I do not quite understand William of Malmesbury (ii. 1 80), who seems to think that Eadmund took a force with him from London (\" oppidaui Edmundum in regem conclamant. Ipse, mox congregato exercitu, apud Pennam juxta Gilingeham Danos fugavit\"), and that the West-Saxons did not acknowledge him till after the battle of Sherstone \u2014 \" quo facto West-Saxonum conversi animi dominum legitimum cognoverunt.\" I see no reason to doubt that the Sceorstan of the Chronicles is Sherstone in Wiltshire, and not Chimney in Oxfordshire, as sug gested by Mr. Thorpe in his note on Florence. Mr. Thorpe objects that Florence places the battle \"in Hwiccia,\" and that Sher stone, as being in Wiltshire, does not answer that description. But Florence also places the battle of Pen \" in Dorsetania,\" which Pen Selwood is not, though Gillingham is. But both Sherstone and Pen Selwood are so near to the marches of their respective shires, that military operations may well have extended in both cases beyond the border. As for the details of the battle of Sherstone, I have mainly followed Florence. The story of Eadric pretending that Eadmund was dead no doubt comes from a ballad, but I do not see that that makes it at all untrustworthy. A contemporary ballad, such as that of Maldon or the lost ballad on which Henry of Huntingdon must have founded his account of Stamfordbridge, is surely very good authority. But while Florence and William of Malmesbury place the story at Sherstone, Henry of Huntingdon transfers it to Assandun; he therefore leaves out the incident of Eadric's striking off the man's head or otherwise professing to have killed Eadmund,"], [744, "696 APPENDIX. a story which was of course inconsistent with Eadric's position at Assandun, where he held a command on Eadmund's side. But this incident is surely an essential part of the story; it is not Florence and William who have added it, but Henry who has left it out. William of Malmesbury simply says that Eadric \" gladium in manu tenens quern, in pugna quodam rustico impigre c\u00e6so, cruen tarat, Fugite, inquit, miseri, fugite, ecce, Rex vester hoc ense occisus est.\" Florence is fuller ; \" Siquidem quum pugna vehemens esset, et Anglos fortiores esse cerneret, cujusdam viri, regi Ead mundo facie capillisque simillimi, Osmeari nomine, capite amputato et in altum levato, exclamat Anglos frustra pugnare, dicens Vos Dorsetenses, Domnani, Wiltonienses, Amisso capite pr\u00e6eipites fugite ; En domini vestri caput Eadmundi Basilei Hie teneo manibus, cedite quantocius.'\" (The same stratagem is said to have been employed by an Eng lish soldier at the Battle of the Standard. See \u00c6thelred of Rievaux, X Scriptt. 345 ; \" Cujusdam prudentis viri figmento, qui caput unius occisi in altum erigens, regem clamabat occisum, revocati, vehementius solito irruunt in obstantes.\" The story is told with great spirit by Peter of Langtoft, i. 480.) The metrical character of the speech given by Florence was first remarked by Professor Stubbs (R. Howden, i. 82); but we may be sure that both this and the other longer speech are merely expan sions of the vigorous little bit of English given us in Henry of Huntingdon, \" Flet Engle, flet Engle, ded is Edmund,\" which are likely enough to be Eadric's real words. Still the speech in Flo rence is valuable (see above, p. 558). It helps us to the party divisions of Wessex at the moment of the battle. The Wils\u00e6tas are here reckoned among the followers of Eadmund, but Florence had just before said that Eadric, \u00c6lfm\u00e6r, and \u00c6lfgar were there \"cum Suthamtoniensibus et Wiltoniensibus provincialibus, in numeraque populi multitudine in parte Danorum.\" It is plain then that the northern and southern parts of Wiltshire were arrayed on opposite sides. The incident of Eadmund taking off his helmet and hurling his spear at Eadric is found only in William of Malmesbury; \" Fugissent continuo Angli, nisi rex, cognita re, in editum quemdam collem procederet, ablata galea caput suum com militonibus ostentans.\" I hope that this is not copied from the"], [745, "THE WAR OF CNUT AND EADMUND. 697 like story of William at Senlac ; it is an incident which might easily repeat itself ; and the notion of Eadmund getting on higher ground to show himself, falls in with the difference between a general fighting on foot like Eadmund and one fighting on horse back like William. There is nothing in the English accounts which calls for special remark till we come to the battle of Assandum. All the accounts agree as to the treason of Eadric at Aylesford. But it is to be noticed that the remark made in p. 4 1 7 as to the two classes of treasons laid to the charge of Eadric applies here. The treasons reported at Sherstone and Assandun must be facts ; the treason reported at Aylesford may have been only a general surmise. As to the order of events all agree, only Florence, in his reckoning, goes by the number of armies, Henry of Huntingdon by that of battles. The third army fought two battles, one under the walls of London, the other at Brentford. As for the battle of Assandun, I have no doubt that the modern Ashington is the true site. In June, 1866, I went over the ground with Mr. Dawkins, Florence in hand. We found that the place exactly answered his description, and I afterwards compared it with the other authorities. Another spot which has been proposed is Ashdown in another part of Essex. I suppose its claims rest on the description of the Encomiast (ii. 9), \"in \u00c6sceneduno loco, quod nos Latini montem fraxinorum possimus interpretari.\" But this only shows the foreign writer's imperfect knowledge of English. Assandun is simply, as Florence has it, mons asini. Henry of Huntingdon's form Esesdun may come from substituting the later genitive asses for the older assan, or from a confusion with \u00c6lfred's \u00c6scesdun in 871, or possibly from a shrinking from so unheroic a meaning as mons asini. The modern form Assington or Ashington is due to the same corruption which has changed Abbawdun and Hunt\u0153>idun and \u00c6lfred's Ethrtwdun into Abingdon, Huntm^don, and ~E,dington. The form in -ing is so common that it has swallowed up others which are less familiar. As for the other hill, Canewdon, the local explanation which connects it with the name of Cnut is certainly very tempting, though it is perhaps a little hard to get it out of Gnutesdun. But the Domesday form (ii. 44) Carendun is clearly corrupt, and the pronunciation Canewdon is a very"], [746, "698 APPENDIX. recent corruption, savouring of the schoolmaster. On the lips of the oldest inhabitant it is distinctly Canewdon, which brings us near, if not to Cnuto, at least to Canutus. The battle of Assandun was distinctly a national struggle on the English side. In the words of the Chronicles, \" p\u00e6r ahte Cnut sige, and gefeht him ealle Engla fjeode.\" So just before, Eadmund's army is called \" ealle Engla peode,\" and Florence says that he came \" cum exercitu quern de tota Anglia contraxerat.\" The presence of Ulfcytel and Godwine witnesses to the presence of the forces of such strongly Danish districts as East-Anglia and even distant Lindesey, while Eadric is distinctly marked in Flo rence as commanding, among other forces, the equally distant Mages\u00e6tas ; \" cum Magesetensibus et exercitus parte cui pr\u00e6erat.\" My account of the battle comes from three sources. The strictly military part of it, the arrangements and intentions of the two generals, comes from Florence. The poetical part, the picture of the King by his Standard and his charge upon the enemy, comes from Henry of Huntingdon ; I have even ventured to bring in a few touches from the Encomiast, whose account of this one battle seems to be historical. But it must be remembered that the stratagem of Eadric, which Florence and William of Malmesbury place at Sherstone, is by Henry of Huntingdon moved to Assan dun. Eadmund, in his great charge, has nearly reached Cnut's post in the Danish army, when Eadric cries out \" Flet Engle,\" &c, takes to flight himself, and the rest of the English army follow him. I hope that I have already shown that the story of Eadmund's pretended death is in its place at Sherstone, and that its details have been changed to make it suit the circumstances of Assandun. It is also plain from the other accounts that, though the flight of Eadric greatly weakened the English forces, yet the battle went on long after. I will now turn to the foreign accounts, beginning with the absolutely contemporary Thietmar. We have seen something of him when dealing with the accounts of the martyrdom of \u00c6lfheah. Thietmar clearly took a deep interest in English affairs without fully understanding them. He wrote down the accounts which he heard at the time as well as he could make them out, but in so doing he often made havoc of his story. Still an author to whom"], [747, "THE WAR OF CNUT AND EADMUND. 699 the struggle of Cnut and Eadmund was the latest piece of foreign news must have his use ; and we shall find that Thietmar here, as before, gives us some hints which, if used cautiously, may be of great value. His account is full of blunders, but there is nothing of perversion, romance, or colouring. His story (vii. 28, ap. Pertz, iii. 849) runs thus. After the death of \u00c6thelred, Harold and Cnut the sons of Swegen, with their Earl Thurgut (\" cum duce suimet Thurguto\"), besiege London with 340 ships, each manned by eighty men. The city was defended by the Lady Emma \u2014 who is described as \" tristis nece viri suimet et defensoris \" \u2014 with her two sons \u00c6thelstan and Eadmund \u2014 \u00c6thelred's first family being as usual mistaken for children of Emma \u2014 together with two Bishops and other chief men (\" duobus episcopis ceterisque prima- tibus\"). The siege lasted six months; at last the Lady, tired out (\" bello defatigata assiduo \"), asked for peace. The Danes de- manded the surrender of the two .\u00c6thelings to be put to death, the payment of 15,000 pounds of silver as the Lady's ransom, of 12,000 pounds as the ransom of the Bishops, the surrender of all the coats of mail in the city, 24,000 in number (\"numerus incredibilis \"), and of 300 hostages. If these terms are not agreed to, all would be put to death (\" sin autem, omnes ter clamabant eos una gladio perituros\"). The Lady (\" venerabilis regina\" \u2014 I need not say that this is a mere title of honour and has no reference to the age of the future bride of Cnut), after some hesitation, consents to these terms. The \u00c6thelings escaped by night in a little boat, and forthwith begin to gather a force for the relief of their mother and of the city. Eadmund one day falls in with Thurgut, who was engaged in plundering. A drawn battle follows, in which both Thurgut and Eadmund are killed. The Danes go back to their ships, and hearing that \u00c6thelstan is coming with a British force to the relief of the city (\" intelligentes urbi solatium ab \u00c6thelsteno superstite et Britannis venientibus afferri \"), they raised the siege after killing or mutilating their hostages (\" trun- catis obsidibus\"). The strictly contemporary character of the account is shown by the prayer with which the Bishop of Merse- burg winds up his story; \" Et destruat eos [Danos] atque disperdat protector in se sperantium Deus, ne umquam solito his vel aliis noceant fidelibus. In ereptione civitatis illius gaudeamus et iu cetero lugeamus.\""], [748, "700 APPENDIX. This account sounds very wild, and it is easy to show that there are plenty of mistakes in it. But written as it was at the very time, while the final upshot of the war was still uncertain, it suggests some very important points. To mistake \u00c6thelstan and Eadmund for sons of Emma was a common and easy blunder. But to suppose ' that Emma had come back to England with \u00c6thelred, that she was now in London, that, with or without the consent of Eadmund, she entered into negotiations with Cnut, are statements which are not found in our Chronicles, but which do not contradict what is found there. They are statements which are perfectly possible ; they may even throw light on the marriage of Cnut and Emma in the next year. The mention of the two Bishops again falls in with the fact, which we have got at in another way, that Archbishop Lyfing was in the city. Then, though it is quite certain that London did not stand a continuous siege of six months, beginning with July 1016, yet London must have been besieged off and on for about that time in the course of the year 1016. Then the death of Eadmund is of course wrongly given, and the death of Thurkill also, if by Thurgut we are to understand Thurkill. But this last point is by no means clear, as Thietmar goes on immediately to tell the story of \u00c6lfheah, in which Thurkill, though not \u00c6lfheah (see above, p. 677), appears with his right name. But the thing which is most remarkable in this account is the mention of Harold the brother of Cnut and of \u00c6thelstan the brother of Eadmund. Harold and \u00c6thelstan are men whose existence we know, but not much more about them. There was no temptation to bring them in, unless they had really played a part in the war. I think we may infer that Harold did accompany Cnut, and that \u00c6thelstan had a share in the campaign \u2014 that is, that he did not die before his father (see above, p. 691). Moreover Thietmar, who called \u00c6lfheah Dunstan, was quite capable of confounding the two brothers and transposing their names. Let us only read Eadmund for \u00c6thelstan and \u00c6thelstan for Eadmund, and we get a consistent and probable narrative. The tale was probably told Thietmar by some one who came from London and who did not enlarge on the western fights of Pen Selwood and Sherstone. He dwelt mainly on what happened in and near his own city. \u00c6thelstan, it would seem, was killed, as is perfectly probable, in one of the battles near"], [749, "THE WAR OF CNUT AND EADMUND. 701 London or in some unrecorded skirmish. The Danes raise the siege, as we know that they twice did, before the armies of Eadmund. Those armies, levied mainly in the western shires, are by Thietmar called Britanni. This expression is one of the most remarkable in the whole story. It must have some special force ; it is not Thietmar's usual way of speaking of Englishmen. We can hardly doubt that Thietmar's English informant, speaking of troops levied mainly within the shires of the old Wealhcyn, spoke of them as Brettas or Wealas. Altogether I look on this account as worthy of all heed. I have not ventured to insert the death of \u00c6thelstan or the negotiation between Emma and Cnut in the text as thoroughly ascertained facts, but I certainly look upon both as highly probable. I must now turn to a foreign writer of quite another character, the Encomiast of Emma. I have already mentioned (see above, p. 670) how he makes Thurkill bring Cnut into England. This is before the death of \u00c6thelred. He now (ii. 6) goes on to tell us how, before Cnut himself landed, Thurkill determined to win Cnut's favour by some great exploit. He therefore lands, in what part of England it is not said, with the crews of forty ships, and fights the battle of Sherstone (\" ascendit cum suis e navibus dirigens aciem contra Anglorum impetum qui tune in loco Scorastan dicto fuerat congregatus \") all by himself against an English force of more than double his numbers (\" Danorum exercitus . . . medietati hostium miiiime par fuerat \"), over whom he of course gains a complete victory. Eric then (see p. 379); fired by the example of Thurkill, is allowed to go on another expedition, in which he fights several battles and wins much plunder. Cnut then, seemingly looking on the country as his own, forbids further ravages (\"rex parcens patri\u00e6, prohibuit ultra earn pr\u00e6dari \"), but orders a strict siege to be laid to London, which is oddly called \" metropolis terr\u00e6,\" and which the writer seems half to fancy was on the sea (\" undique enim mari quodammodo non pari vallatur flumine\"). Just at this time \u00c6thelred died, being removed, according to the Encomiast, by God's special providence, in order that Cnut might enter the city and that both Danes and English men might have a breathing space ; \" Deus itaque qui omnes homines vult magis salvare quam perdere, intuens has gentes tanto"], [750, "APPENDIX. 702 periculo laborare, eum principem qui interius civitati pr\u00e6sidebat educens e corpore, junxit quieti sempitern\u00e6, ut eo defuncto liber Cnutoni ingressus pateret, et utrique populo confecta pace paulisper respirare copia esset.\" The citizens accordingly bury \u00c6thelred and make a capitulation with Cnut, by which the city is surrendered to him. Cnut accordingly enters the city, and if not crowned, is at least enthroned ; \" Cnuto civitatem intravit, et in solio regni resedit.\" But a part of the troops within the city disapprove of the agreement with Cnut, so on the night after his entrance they leave the city with a young man called Eadmund, a son of the late King; \"cum filio defuncti principis egressi sunt civitatem;\" so directly after \" \u00c6dmund, sic enim juvenis qui exercitum collegerat dictus est.\" Eadmund easily gathers an army, because the English were more inclined to him than they were to Cnut ; \" nee quieverunt quousque omnes pene Anglos sibi magis adhuc adclines quam Cnutoni conglobarent.\" Cnut is meanwhile in London, but finding that he cannot trust the Londoners, he first repairs his ships, and then leaves the city and winters in Sheppey, having declined an offer of single combat made to him by Eadmund. Eadmund enters London, where he is joyfully received, and spends the winter, having Eadric with him as his chief counsellor (\" erat quoque ejus partis comes primus Edricus, consiliis pollens, sed tamen dolositate versipellis, quern sibi ad aurem posuerat \u00c6dmund in omnibus negotiis\"). The next Lent is spent by Eadmund in gathering a vast force with the intention of driving Cnut out of the country. The story now becomes more trustworthy, and we get a spirited account of the battle of Assandun, from which I have not scrupled to draw largely in the text. I need only mention here that the treacherous flight of Eadric is as distinctly asserted as in any English account. The only difference is that it is placed before the battle has actually begun. The words are \" Ibique, nondum congressione facta, Edric, quern primum coroi tem \u00c6dmundi diximus, h\u00e6c suis intulit affamina, 'Fugiamus, 0 soeii, vitamque subtrahamus morte imminenti, alioquin occumbe mus illico, Danorum enim duritiam nosco.' Et velato vexillo quod dextra gestabat, dans tergum hostibus, magnam partem militum bello fraudabat. Et, ut quidam aiunt, hoc non caussa egit timoris sed dolositatis, ut postea claruit ; quia hoc eum clam Danis pro misisse, nescio quo pro beneficio, assertio multoram dicit.\""], [751, "THE WAR OF CNUT AND EADMUND. 703 The Scandinavian writers are, if possible, yet more wonderful. In the Saga of Olaf Haraldsson (Laing, i. 8; Johnstone, 89) we read how, when \u00c6thelred came back from Normandy, or, according to this account, from Flanders, Olaf took service under him and joined in an attack on London, which was then held by the Danes. Olaf with his ships breaks down London bridge and takes South wark, on which the Londoners surrender and receive \u00c6thelred. Olaf passes the winter in England, and, strange to say, fights the battle of Ringmere in Ulfcytel's land (p. 93); \"pa atto peir orrosto micla a Hringmaraheidi a Ulfkelslaudi, pat riki atti pa Ulfkell Snillingr.\". (See above, p. 654.) By a yet more amazing confusion Olaf is next made to take Canterbury; he then has the general command of all England, where he stays three years. In the third year \u00c6thelred dies, and is succeeded by his sons Ead mund and Eadward. Olaf now leaves England, and performs divers exploits in Valland or Gaul. Meanwhile Cnut and Eric come into England, where Eric fights a battle near London, in which Ulfcytel is killed. Cnut fights several battles with the sons of \u00c6thelred with various success. He then marries Emma, by whom he has three children, Harold, Harthacnut, and Gunhild. He then divides the kingdom with Eadmund, who is presently killed by Eadric Streona. Cnut now drives all the sons of \u00c6thelred out of England; they take refuge at Rouen in Valland, where Olaf joins them. They lay plans for recovering England from Cnut, Northumberland being promised to Olaf. Olaf sends over his foster-father Rana (see p. 404) into England, who spends a winter there, collecting forces. In the spring Olaf and the sons of \u00c6thel red go over into England themselves, but after some fighting, the power of Cnut is found to be too strong for them, so Olaf goes into Norway and the sons of \u00c6thelred return to Valland. Not less amazing is the version in the Knytlinga Saga (c. 7-16; Johnstone, 103 et seqq.). Here again \u00c6thelred is made to return after the death of Swegen with the help of Olaf. Cnut is only ten years old at his father's death ; still, as his brother Harold is dead, he succeeds in Denmark. After three years, it is thought good that he should assert his claims to England. So he sets sail with the Earls Eric and Ulf, and with Heming and Thurkill the Tall, the sons of Strut-Harold (see above, p. 670). They land in England at a place called Fliot ; their first battle is fought"], [752, "APPENDIX. 704 in Lindesey. They then take the town of Hemingburgh (\" Hem ingaborg a Englandi\") and go on conquering towards the south. In the autumn \u00c6thelred dies, Emma is just about to leave Eng land, when Cnut stops her and persuades her to marry him (see Appendix ZZ). The English now (p. 129) choose four Kings, sons of \u00c6thelred and Emma (\"Eptir andlat Adalrads konungs voru til konunga teknir synir hans oc Emmu drotningar \"). The eldest is Eadmund the Strong (\" Jatmundr enn sterki\"), the others Eadgar, Eadwig, and Eadward the Good (\" Jatvardr enn godi,\" see above, p. 688). The battle of Sherstone is now fought, but one is rather surprised to find it fought in Northumberland by the banks of the Tees. Eadmund and Cnut both fight on horseback, and meet face to face in the battle. On a report that Eadmund is killed the English take to flight. After this is placed the story of Godwine's introduction to Ulf (see Note ZZ). Cnut next defeats the sons of \u00c6thelred in a battle at Brentford, then conies (p. 134) the battle of Assundun, which is described as \"Assatun to the north of the Daneswood \" (\" Knutr konungr atti ena pridu orrostu vid Adalradsyni, }5ar sem heita Assatun : vard par en mikil orrosta : pat er nordr fra Danaskogum\"). A fourth battle and a fourth defeat of the English follows at Norwich. Eadmund and his brothers then take shelter in London. Cnut sails up the river and besieges the city. The English come out to fight, and, while Cnut continues the siege, Eric, with some of the Thingmen, fights a battle against Ulfcytel (\"Ulfkell Snillingr\") and puts him to flight. He then wins another battle at Ringmere. Cnut is still besieging Eadmund in London, when it is agreed that the kingdom shall be divided. Then follows the murder of Eadmund. (See Appendix WW.) All this is wonderful enough, but it is hardly so wonderful as what we read, not in any saga, but in the sober. Annals of Roskild (Langebek, i. 376); \" Sven Angliam invasit, regem Adel radum expulit et Britanni\u00e6 fines potitus, vix tres menses supervixit. Post cujus mortem Edmundus filius Adelradi, quem Sveno expulit, Kanutum filium Suenonis et Olavum filium Olavi regis Norwegi\u00e6, qui ibi obsides fuerant, in vincula conjecit {see p. 375). . . . Mortuo Edmundo rege Anglorum filius Adelradus in regnum successit.

Kanutus victor exsistens, ipsam Ymmam duxit uxorem, genuitque ex ea filium Hartheknud.\" It is hardly worth while examining these stories in detail, though it would not be hard to point out some of their confusions and transpositions. They should make us thankful for the priceless heritage of our own Chronicles. NOTE WW. p. 395. The Conference of Cnut and Eadmund. The conference between Cnut and Eadmund has grown in the hands of many historians, from Henry of Huntingdon onwards, into a single combat between the two Kings, which, as Mr. Earle says (Saxon Chronicles Parallel, 340), \" became in the course of time one of the established sensation scenes of history.\" The Chronicles and Florence know nothing of the story. The Chronicles simply say, \"And coman begen pa cyningas tog\u00e6dre \u00e6t Olauige,\" and go on to mention the terms of the agreement. So Florence, who is a little fuller ; \" Dein uterque rex in insulam qu\u00e6 Olanege appellatur, et est in ipsius fluminis medio sita, trabariis advehitur, ubi pace, amicitia, fraternitate, et pacto et sacramentis confirmata, regnum dividitur.\" The Knytlinga Saga knows nothing of the story, and the Encomiast (ii. 12, 13) describes at great length the negotiation which led to the division of the kingdom, without any reference to a combat. Mr. Earle ingeniously suggests that the notion of the combat arose from a misunderstanding of the words of the Chronicles, as the words \"coman tog\u00e6dre\" might mean either a hostile meeting or a friendly conference, \u2014 the latter of course being their meaning here. It is hardly worth while to go at length through all the later versions, but the utterly different accounts in William of Malmes bury and Henry of Huntingdon, and the strange tale of Walter Map, may well be compared together. According to William (ii. 180), Eadmund had already collected a new army in Gloucestershire, and VOL. 1. z z"], [754, "706 APPENDIX. the two armies are standing ready for battle, \" quum infestis signis constitissent.\" Then Eadmund, to spare further bloodshed (\" ne duo homunculi propter ambitionem regnandi tot subjectorum sanguine culparentur \"), proposes a single combat. This challenge Cnut re fuses, on the ground that he would have no chance against a man so much bigger and stronger than himself as Eadmund was ; \" Abnuit prorsus, pronuncians animo se quidem excellere sed contra tarn ingentis molis hominem corpusculo diffidere.\" He proposes instead that, as each of them had a fair claim to a kingdom which had been held by his father (\" quia ambo non indebite regnum efflagitent, quod patres amborum tenuerint \"), instead of fighting for the king dom, they should divide it between them. The armies on both sides agree, and the division is quietly carried out, though seem ingly against the wishes of Eadmund, who is spoken of as \" unanimi clamore omnium superatus.\" In Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 756 C, D), when the armies are gathered together in Gloucestershire for the seventh time, the chief men (\" proceres \"), seemingly on both sides, agree that, instead of another battle, the two Kings shall decide the matter by single combat (\"pugnent singulariter qui regnare student singulariter \"). The Kings ap prove, and Henry adds, \" nee enim mediocris erat rex Cnut probitatis.\" They fight therefore in Olney (\" positi igitur reges in Olanie duellum inceperunt \"). Henry of Huntingdon seems to have been not quite clear whether he ought to describe a French tournament or a Scandinavian holmgang. There is no mention of horses, but we read of the lances being broken, and it is not till then that the champions draw their swords. Then the fight really begins. The people on each side behold and listen to the \" horri biles tinnitus et igneas collisiones,\" which most likely come from a ballad. The strength of Eadmund however has the better of it (\"tandem vigor incomparabilis Edmundi fulminare c\u0153pit.\" See above, p. 392). Cnut resists manfully, but begins to fear for his life; he therefore proposes that they shall fight no longer, but divide the kingdom and become sworn brothers (\" fratres adop tivi\"). Eadmund agrees (\" his verbis juvenis mens generosa delinita est \"), and they exchange the kiss of peace. Walter Map (De Nugis, 204) has yet another version. The armies meet one another \" apud Durherst in valle Gloucestri\u00e6 super Sabrinam.\" The Danes have the larger host (\" Chnutus dimidium Angli\u00e6"], [755, "THE CONFERENCE OF CNUT AND EADMUND. 707 cum Dacis adduxerat\"). Still the Danes are afraid, because of the valour of the English and their own unjust cause. They therefore demand that the matter shall be settled by a single combat of champions (\" Fiat pro bello duellum, et victor pugil domino suo regnum obtineat c\u00e6teris in pace dimisis\"). Eadmund determines to fight himself and not by a champion ; so Cnut deter mines to do the same (\" quatinus informis absit imparitas, par enim congressio regum et bene consona\"). They meet in the island on horseback, their horses are killed, and they fight on foot. The personal description of the Kings is quite unlike any other (\"Chnutus procerus et major et altus, Edmundum grandem et planum, i.e. mediocriter pinguem, tarn probo tarn improbo fatigavit assultu\"). They exchange sarcasms and go on fighting, till the Danes, seeing Cnut in danger, demand that the Kings should make a treaty. They accordingly agree to divide the kingdom and to become sworn brothers (\" Dad .... in f\u0153dus eos hujusmodi multis coegerunt precibus et lacrymis, quatinus \u00e6qualiter inter eos divisum possiderent tota vita sua regnum, et post mortem alterius succederet superstes in solidum, factique sunt ibi fratres et amici, fideque firmissima conglutinati \"). Roger of Wendover (i. 457-459) tells the same story, but at much greater length and with a much greater display of eloquence. He attributes the first proposal of the single combat to Eadric (\"iniquus dux Eadricus\"). The fight and the proposal on the part of Cnut are essentially the same as in Henry of Huntingdon. Cnut makes a long speech, in which he sets forth the greatness of his own dominion in words which would have been somewhat beyond the truth some years later (\" mihi Dacia servit, mihi Norwegia succumbit, mihi rex Suanorum manus dedit \"). Besides the kiss of peace, the exchange of arms and clothes is described (\"in signum pacis vestes mutantes et arma, fit Eadmundus Cnuto et Cnuto Eadmundus\"). The exchange of garments is also mentioned by Florence in his account of the peaceful conference (\" armis et vestibus mutatis . . . ab invicem discesserunt \"); but if the tradition followed by William of Malmesbury as to the personal stature of the two Kings be at all trustworthy, a judgement of Cyrus would presently have been needed to restore the clothes to their former owners. The place of meeting, the island in the Severn called Olney, is placed near Deerhurst by the Worcester Chronicler, by Florence, Z Z 2"], [756, "APPENDIX. 708 and by Walter Map, all of whom had local knowledge ; the other Chronicles do not mention its position. Mr. Earle (Parallel Chro nicles, 341) places it close to Gloucester. I have not examined either place for the purpose, but I should be inclined to look on the witness of the Hwiccian writers as decisive. As for the terms of the treaty, three of the Chronicles simply assign Wessex to Eadmund and Mercia to Cnut. It was perhaps held that Cnut was already King of the Northumbrians, and that his possession of that kingdom could not be called in question. The Worcester Chronicle says more exactly, \" and feng pa Ead mund cyng to Westsexan and Cnut to pam norS d\u00e6le.\" Florence makes the important addition of East-Anglia, Essex, and London to the share of Eadmund. Henry of Huntingdon gives London to Cnut ; \" Edmundus regnum suscepit Westsexe, Cnut vero reg num Merce suscipiens reversus est Londoniam.\" William of Malmesbury follows the three Chronicles. The Encomiast (ii. 13) talks simply of North and South. The English deputies say to Cnut, \"Dominare in australi\" \u2014 for which we must of course read \"boreali\" \u2014 \"parte cum quiete, e regione autem sit noster \u00c6d mundus in finibus meridian\u00e6 plag\u00e6.\" Walter Map (De Nugis, 206) gives quite another division ; \" Chnutus Lundoniam et illas trans Hichenild partes habebat, Edmundus alias.\" This reads like an utter turning about of the whole geography; the Icknild way is an approach to the frontier as traced by Florence ; only Cnut is placed in Wessex and East-Anglia, and Eadmund in the rest of the kingdom. I have no doubt as to accepting the line drawn by Florence. Ever since the extinction of the short-lived dynasty of Guthrum, we always find East-Anglia heartily throwing in its lot with Wessex, never with Mercia and Northumberland. The distinct statement that the Imperial supremacy was reserved to Eadmund is found, oddly enough, only in Roger of Wendover. His text runs thus ; \" Dividitur itaque regnum, Eadmundo dictante, inter duos, ita ut corona totius regni regi remaneat Eadmundo ; cedunt ergo in usus ejus totam Angliam ad australem plagam Thamesis fluminis, cum Est-Sexia et Est- Anglia et civitate Londoniarum, qu\u00e6 caput est regni; Cnutone etiam aquilonales partes Angli\u00e6 obtinente.\" Roger would of course be by himself no authority on such a"], [757, "THE CONFERENCE OF CNUT AND EADMUND. 709 point ; but it is plain that he is copying Florence. In the text of Florence there is a gap, which can be filled up only, as Mr. Thorpe has filled it, with the words of Roger; \" West-Saxoniam, East- Angliam, East-Saxoniam cum Lundonia [civitate, et totam terram ad australem plagam Tamesis fluminis obtinuit Eadmundus, Canuto aquilonares partes Angli\u00e6 obtinente ; corona tamen] regni Eadmundo mansit.\" A certain superiority on the part of Eadmund appears also in the words of William of Malmesbury ; \" Edmundus . . . concordi\u00e6 indulsit, f\u0153dusque cum Cnutone percussit, sibi West-Saxoniam, illi concedens Merciam.\" Henry of Huntingdon (756 C), on the other hand, falls into the mistake of supposing that Cnut occupied Lon don after the battle of Assandun, perhaps that he was crowned then ; \" Rex Cnut, tanta fretus victoria, Londoniam et sceptra cepit regalia.\" In the Encomiast Cnut naturally takes a lofty tone ; the other King is to be his tributary. Such at least seems to be the meaning of the words, \" Sed tamen vectigal etiam su\u00e6 partis vester rex, quicumque ille fuerit, exercitui dabit meo. Hoc enim illi debeo, ideoque aliter pactum non laudo.\" It is hard to weigh the exact meaning of these rhetorical writers, but this sounds like something more lasting than the single Danegeld which was undoubtedly to be paid. This last is witnessed by the Chronicles. The Kings, among their other agreements, \" p\u00e6t gyld setton wiS pone here.\" So Florence, \" Tributo quod classic\u00e6 manui penderetur statute.\" One point still remains. After the death of Eadmund, Cnut, according to the account in Florence, claimed his dominions by virtue of the Olney compact. He asks the witnesses whether any provision had been made for the succession of the brothers or sons of Eadmund, in case Eadmund died before Cnut ; \" Interrogavit . . . . qualiter ipse et Eadmundus de fratribus et filiis ejusdem inter se loquuti fuissent. Utrum fratribus et filiis ejus liceret in regno Occidentalium Saxonum post patrem eorum regnare, si Eadmundus moreretur vivente illo.\" They made the answer which I have given in the text at p. 405 ; \" Se proculdubio scire quod rex Eadmundus fratribus suis nullam portionem regni sui, nee se spirante neque moriente, commendasset ; dixeruntque hoc se nosse, Eadmundum regem velle Canutum adjutorem et protectorem esse filiorum ejus, donee regnandi \u00e6tatem habuissent.\" Florence goes"], [758, "710 APPENDIX. on to say that their witness was false, and that the false witnesses were, when a convenient season came, characteristically put to death by Cnut. But an agreement that each King should succeed to the dominions of the other, that is, that the adoptive brother should be preferred to the brother by blood, is in every way likely. Such an agreement is directly asserted in the Knytlinga Saga, c. 16 (Johnstone, 139). Cnut and Eadmund divide the land and swear that, if either of them dies childless, he shall succeed to the dominions of the other (\" sva, at skipta skylldi i helminga lanndi med peim, oc hafa halft riki hvarr, medan peir lifdi ; enn ef annarrhvarr anndadiz barnlauss, pa skylldi sa taka allt rikit med frialsu, er eptir lifdi ; oc var su s\u00e6tt eidum bunndin \"). In Saxo (192) the agreement between Cnut and Eadmund (whom he calls Eadward) is all on one side ; Cnut is to have half the kingdom while Eadmund lives, and the whole at his death (\" Edvardus . . . pactum cum hoste conseruit, ut quoad ipse viveret, Canutum dimidii regni consortem haberet, extinctus omnium honorum h\u00e6re dem relinqueret \"). This would seem to shut out Eadmund's children, which seems inconsistent with the account in Florence. But some agreement to exclude the brothers on each side was almost necessary. A claim on the part of one of the \u00c6thelings to succeed Eadmund, a claim on the part of Harold of Denmark to succeed Cnut, would be almost sure to be put forward. And it might be thought to be on the whole for the common interest of both Kings to shut out such claims. The brothers on both sides were much more dangerous than the sons. Cnut most likely had no children as yet. And even if either of the doubtful brood of \u00c6lfgifu of Northampton was already born, he must have still been in his cradle. So were the two little \u00c6thelings, the \" clitun culi\" of Florence, the sons of Eadmund and Ealdgyth. The words of the witnesses clearly imply that these children were put in a different position from their uncles. The possibility of their coming to the crown is recognized ; Cnut is to be their guardian till they are of age to reign. Of course this does not mean that he was to resign in their favour when they came of age ; it means only that they were to be in the same position as other minor \u00c6thelings, as the sons of \u00c6thelred the First (see p. 109) or the sons of Eadmund the Magnificent (see p. 63). They were to be passe 1 over for the present ; at any future vacancy they might"], [759, "THE DEATH OF EADMUND. 711 be elected or they might not. An arrangement of this kind seems to agree both with the words of the witnesses and with the circum stances of the case. I assume of course that, if Cnut was to succeed Eadmund, Eadmund was equally to succeed Cnut, just as in the agreement between Harthacnut and Magnus (see p. 508). No other terms would be possible in an agreement between two sworn brothers, in which whatever superiority there was to be on either side was reserved to Eadmund. NOTE XX. p. 398. The Death of Eadmund. The Chronicles are silent as to the manner and place of Ead mund's death. All that they say is. \"pa to See Andreas m\u00e6ssan forSferde se kyning Eadmund.\" Florence adds, \" decessit Lun doni\u00e6.\" He mentions neither Cnut nor Eadric, and in a later passage he seems to exclude Eadric. At least when Cnut puts Eadric to death, the reason is said to be, \"quia timebat insidiis ab eo aliquando circumveniri, sicut domini sui priores \u00c6gelredus et Eadmundus frequenter sunt circumventi.\" If Florence had thought that Eadmund was killed by Eadric, he would surely have said so more plainly. The treasons of Eadric towards \u00c6thelred and towards Eadmund are put on a level, and no one ever charged Eadric with the death of \u00c6thelred. Florence, as his whole narrative shows, was not slack at attributing crimes to Eadric, but that he had anything to do with the death of Eadmund he nowhere hints. The language of the Encomiast (ii. 14) is obscure and mysterious, and his way of speaking of the Deity may be thought slightly anthropomorphic. God, in his wisdom, took away Eadmund, lest the contention for the crown should be renewed, and in order that Cnut might possess the whole kingdom peaceably. The whole passage is remarkable ; \"Verumtamen Deus, niemor su\u00e6 antiqu\u00e6 doctrin\u00e6, scilicet omne regnum in seipsum divisum diu permanere non posse, non longo post tempore \u00c6dmundum eduxit e corpore, Anglorum misertus Imperii, ne forte, si uterque superviveret, neuter regnaret"], [760, "712 APPENDIX. secure, et regnum diatim adnihilaretur renovata contentione. . . . Cujus rei gratia eum Deus jusserit obire, mox deinde patuit ; quia universa regio illico Cnutonem sibi regem elegit, et cui ante omni conamine restitit, tune sponte sua se illi et omnia sua subdidit.\" Adam of Bremen, who is not very well versed in English genealogy, says (ii. 51), \"Frater Adelradi Emund, vir bellicosus, in gratiam victoris veneno sublatus est.\" The murderer, whether Eadric or any one else, is not mentioned, and the words, though they might be taken as accusing Cnut, perhaps rather point to a version more like some of those which I shall presently mention. We now come to the long string of English writers who accuse Eadric. William of Malmesbury (ii. 180) says that Eadmund died \" ambiguum quo casu extinctus ; \" he then goes on to mention the charge against Eadric as a rumour ; \" Fama Edricum infamat, quod favore alterius mortem ei per ministros porrexerit. Cubioularios regis fuisse duos, quibus omnem vitam suam commiserat, quos pollicitationibus illectos, et primo immanitatem flagitii exhorrentes, brevi complices suos effeeisse. Ejus consilio ferreum uncum, ad natur\u00e6 requisita sedenti, in locis posterioribus adegisse.\" Here the deed is done by two chamberlains of Eadmund. In another version the actual murderer is a son of Eadric. The intention of this change is obvious. The son of Eadric is of course meant to be a son of Eadmund's sister Eadgyth, so that we get the additional horror of a sister's son killing his uncle. It was either forgotten that a son of Eadric and Eadgyth would be a mere child, or else to kill Eadmund by the hand of a child was thought to be a further improvement. The scene is also placed at Oxford. In this shape we get the tale in Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 756 D); \" Edmundus rex post paucos exhinc dies proditione occisus est apud Oxineford. Sic autem occisus est. Quum rex hostibus suis terribilis et timendissimus in regno floreret, ivit nocte quadam in domum evacuationis ad requisita natur\u00e6, ubi filius Edrici ducis in fovea secretaria delitescens consilio patris, regem inter celanda cultello bis acuto percussit, et inter viscera ferrum figens, fugiens reliquit.\" Walter Map (De Nugis, 205-207) has a very strange story, in which, among other things, he takes care to keep the whole tale"], [761, "THE DEATH OF EADMUND. 713 in his own part of England. He nowhere names Eadric, but, just as before in the case of \u00c6thelred (see above, p. 658), he speaks of a \" servus \" whose relations to Eadmund would seem to have been somewhat the same as those of Chiffinch to Charles the Second. This man asks the King for the lands of Minsterworth m Gloucestershire, a parish of which Walter himself was parson, and which, according to his account of the division (see above, p. 708), would come within the share of Eadmund. The King does not refuse the gift, but delays it. The servant plans his death, and carries out his purpose at Minsterworth by much the same means as those described by William of Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon. The King, mortally wounded at Minsterworth, is carried to die at Ross. Roger of Wendover (i. 459) tells the story in nearly the same words as Henry of Huntingdon, beginning with a panegyric on Eadmund which is essentially the same as the panegyrics on Godwine, Harold, and others (see vol. ii. c. vii. and above, p. 400) ; \"Rex Anglorum Eadmundus, dum justis in regno appareret man suetus et pius ac injustis terribilis et crudelis, invidit ejus bonitati dux et proditor Eadricus, Merciorum dominus, et qualiter eum perderet infatigabiliter cogitavit.\" The opportunity comes when Eadmund is at Oxford, which is evidently looked on as a town within Eadric's government. The title \" Merciorum dominus \" is odd. We have heard of nothing like it since \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thel fl\u00e6d. See above, p. 574. Bromton (X Scripts. 906) gives three versions, that of Florence, that of Henry of Huntingdon, and a third. He decides in favour of that of Henry ; \" Verior aliis et authenticior habetur.\" His other version contains quite a new story, but one which shows that the story of the murder of \u00c6lfhelm was running in the heads of those who devised it. Nothing else could have suggested the description of Eadric as \" Edricus perfidus comes Saiopi\u00e6 semper proditor.\" Eadmund and Eadric are now on good terms; the Earl asks the King to visit him at his house, seemingly either at Shrewsbury or at Oxford. After the evening meal, the King is led to his bedroom. He there finds a figure of an archer of wonderful workmanship, with his bow bent and an arrow ready to shoot. He examines and touches it ; the arrow goes off, and pierces and kills Eadmund, that being the end for which the ingenious piece of"], [762, "APPENDIX. 714 mechanism was made. This introduction of a mechanical con trivance instead of the simpler forms of murder which we find in the earlier forms of the story may be paralleled with the other mechanical contrivance which appears in the later forms of the story of Eadric's own death. See Note BBB. Knighton (X Scripts. 2316) brings in the death of Eadmund with a most amazing preface. Eadmund has reigned five years, and he is then put to death at Gloucester, seemingly by a vote of the Witan, on a charge of favouring the Danes, a precedent which seems not to have been remembered in 1649. It seems to be only the manner of his death which is left to the ingenuity of Eadric. The words ran thus ; \" Edmundus quinto anno regni sui apud Glovemiam, pro eo quod barones sui suspicabantur eum proditorem et subversorem communis profectus regni sui [\" a tyrant, traitor, murderer, and public enemy \"], eo quod nimis inclinatus suit antedictis Danis et pr\u00e6tulit eorum consilium, consilio regiorum suorum juratorum fidelium, incurrit mortem infra scriptam. De morte ejus mult\u00e6 sunt opiniones, sed sufficiat una pro omnibus, quum sit per prodi- tionem occisum Edrici.\" He then tells the story of the archer, which he calls \"unum tristegum cum imagine ad similitudinem unius sagittarii.\" Ducange (in voce) is puzzled at the \" tristegum,\" which generally means a structure of three stages, whether a house or a moveable tower. Knighton then tells, as an alternative version, the story of Henry of Huntingdon, only making Eadric himself the actual murderer, but with a further alternative of the two chamberlains. He adds that Eadric at once went to the widowed Ealdgyth, took her two children from her, and carried them away to Cnut. With regard to the place where all this happened, we have seen that the Chroniclers are silent, that Florence names London, that Henry of Huntingdon names Oxford, while other writers name various other places. Amidst all this contradiction it is safest to cleave to Florence. But Mr. James Parker (History of Oxford, p. 26 and Postscriptum 3) argues strongly on behalf of Oxford. His best argument is that Oxford lies on the road between Gloucester and London, and that it is the last place within the Mercian jurisdiction of Eadric. But this assumes that Eadric was at this moment Earl"], [763, "THE DEATH OF EADMUND. 715 of the Mercians. He was so at an earlier and at a later time, and it is assumed in the version of Roger of Wendover that Oxford was at this time under his government. But the position of Eadric at this moment is qui.-.- uncertain, and a story of a murder done by Eadric in his own earldom, especially a murder done at Oxford, seems to connect this story with the stories of \u00c6lfhelm, Morkere, and Sigeferth, the former husband of Eadmund's wife Ealdgyth. The mention of Shrewsbury in the so-called Bromton clearly conies from the same mint, and it seems to me that the mention of either Oxford or Shrewsbury is a part of the mytho p\u0153ic process. Those who put together this version most likely forgot that Oxford lay within Cnut's share of the kingdom. In none of these English versions is it hinted that Cnut had any share in the deed. Eadric, in a later stage of the story, pleads the murder of Eadmund as a merit towards Cnut, and that is all. It is only by Cnut's own countrymen that he is directly charged with the crime. The Knytlinga Saga (c. 16 ; Johnstone, 139) calmly tells us that Eadric, the confident and foster-brother of Eadmund, killed him \u2014 we are not told how \u2014 on the receipt of a bribe from Cnut. \" Heidrekr Striona het ein rikr madr, er fe tok til pess as Knuti konungi, et hann sviki Jatmund konung, oc dr\u00e6pi hann med mordvigi, oc petta var hans bani : Heidrekr var po fostri Jatmundar konungs, oc trudi hann honom sem sialfun ser.\" Saxo (192, 193) has a story how, seven years after the agreement with Eadmund, Cnut is saluted at supper by some nameless person as King of all England. The bearers of the news then say that they have killed Eadmund to win Cnut's favour, on which Cnut puts them to death. This is of course one version of the death of Eadric. See Note BBB. Saxo then adds, \" Memorant alii Edvardum [Edmundum, see above, p. 710] clandestino Canuti imperio occisum, ejusdemque jussu p\u0153nam a maleficis gratia demend\u00e6 suspicionis exactam. Ut enim innocenti\u00e6 su\u00e6 fidem adstrueret, seque ei culp\u00e6 affinem fuisse negaret, gravius in scele ratos consulendum putavit. Ea tamen res primum regis apud domesticos favorem quassavit.\" These last words are very remark able. They seem to fall in with several hints from otfier sources, which seem to show that Cnut, at least in his later days, was much less popular in Denmark than in England."], [764, "716 APPENDIX. Snorro, in the Saga of Saint Olaf (Laing, ii. 21; Johnstone, 98), simply says that Eadric killed Eadmund ; \" A sama manadi drap Heinrekr Striona Eadmund konung.\" But he adds that Cnut at once drove all the sons of \u00c6thelred out of England, and quotes the poet Sigvat, who is also quoted in the Kuytlinga Saga, who says that Cnut either killed or banished all the sons of \u00c6thelred. \"Oc senn sono Adalrads eda Slo hvern oe t>6 Utfl\u00e6mdi Knutr.\" The allusion here must be either to Eadmund or to Eadwig (see the next Note), most likely to Eadmund. Of the manner of Eadmund's death there is no mention in any of these writers. But the singularly base form of murder which so many English writers attribute to Eadric or his emissaries was not without other examples in that age. The younger Dedi of Saxony was said to have been killed in this way in 1068, and Gozelo, Duke of Lotharingia, in 1078 (see Lambert in annis, pp. 74 and 221 of the lesser Pertz). And the great Countess herself is charged with doing the like to her husband \" Gigo, Duke of Normandy,\" (Vit. Mat. c. viii ; Muratori, v. 393). It is also essentially the same as the way in which the defender of Stamfordbridge was killed (see Hen. Hunt. M. H. B. 762 B), and a large part of a German army is said to have been destroyed in nearly the same way when the Emperor Henry the Fifth invaded Poland in 1109. Dlugoss, Hist. Pol. lib. iv. vol. i. col. 378 (ed. Lips. 171 1). And now as to the truth of the story. I think we can hardly do more than say, with William of Malmesbury, \" ambiguum quo casu extinctus.\" Eadmund died at a moment most convenient for Cnut. Cnut therefore, whether he really had a hand in his death or not, was sure to be suspected of it. Eadric was held to be capable of every crime, and was popularly believed to be the actual doer of every crime that was done. Eadric therefore was sure to be suspected as well as Cnut. Eadric was doubtless capable of the crime ; so, I fear, was Cnut also at this time of his life. But the direct evidence against either does not seem strong enough for a conviction. The silence of Florence, compared with his language elsewhere, tells in favour of Eadric. The silence of all the English writers tells in favour of Cnut. This silence could hardly he owing to his later popularity in England, which has thrown no"], [765, "THE TWO EADWIGS. 717 veil over the other crimes of his early reign. Florence can hardly fail to have heard the charge both against Eadric and against Cnut, but, while speaking of their other crimes, he leaves this out. On the other hand, there is something which tells against Cnut in the studied obscurity and overdone piety of the special panegyrist of himself and his wife. NOTE YY p. 406. The\" two Eadwigs. Nothing can be plainer than that Eadwig King of the Churls is quite a different person from Eadwig the \u00c6theling. The two are confounded by Brornton (907), who says, \" Consilio Edrici exlegavit Edwinum, Edmundi regis fratrem, qui ceorlesking, id est rex rusticorum, appellabatur ; postmodum tamen dolose re conciliatus, factione secretariorum suorum fraudulenter occisus est.\" I can offer no guess as to the reason of the singular surname of \" ceorla cyning,\" which is found in the three Chronicles, Abingdon, Worcester, and Peterborough. Nor can I say anything as to Ead wig's earlier history. An \" Eadwig minister \" signs a charter of \u00c6thelred in 1005 (Cod. Dip], iii. 345), and before that, in 996, land at Bensington had been granted by \u00c6thelred (vi. 136) to three brothers, Eadric, Eadwig, and Ealdred. As to the fate of the King of the Churls, the Worcester and Peterborough Chronicles, followed by Florence, place his banishment in 1017, Florence adding, \" vero sequenti tempore cum rege pacificatus est Eadwius.' The Abingdon Chronicle puts off his banishment to the Gemot at Cirencester in 1020. Possibly he was outlawed, reconciled, and outlawed again. We hear nothing of his death. Of the \u00c6theling 'Eadwig, the Worcester and Peterborough Chronicles (1 01 7) simply say, \"Cnut cyning aflymde ut Eadwig \u00e6Seling.\" Abingdon adds, \" and eft hine het ofslean.\" Florence, under the years 10 16 and 10 17, has two stories which it is not very easy to reconcile with one another. I suspect however that they arose, like the other statements of Florence under the years 10 1 6 and 10 1 7, out of two different accounts of the acts of Cnut's first"], [766, "APPENDIX. 718 Midwinter Gemot. The first version, under 1016, immediately follows the vote by which the sons aud brothers of Eadmund were set aside. It was followed by a vote of banishment against the \u00c6theling Eadwig \u2014 \" Eadwius egregius et reverendissimus regis Eadmundi germanus.\" Then Cnut holds a conference with Eadric, and asks him if he can by any means beguile Eadwig to death (\"quomodo decipere posset Eadwium, ut mortis subiret peri culum\"). Eadric answers that there is a man fitter for the purpose than himself, namely a nobleman named \u00c6thelweard \u2014 which of all the \u00c6thelweards it is hard to say, but he is described as being \"ex nobilissimo genere Anglorum ortus.\" \u00c6thelweard, it seems, had better opportunities of familiar intercourse with the \u00c6theling than Eadric had. Cnut sends for \u00c6thelweard and makes him the largest promises, if he will undertake the murder of Eadwig. \" Bring me his head,\" says Cnut, \" and you shall be dearer to me than a brother.\" \u00c6thelweard undertakes the task, but, bike Uhtred in the case of Thurbrand, without any intention of performing it. So Eadwig escapes, at least for one while. Directly after, under 10 17, as soon as Florence has recorded the fourfold division of England and the mutual oaths of Cnut and the English, he goes on to say that, by the advice of Eadric (\"consilio perfidi ducis Eadrici\"), Cnut banished both Eadwigs (\"rex Canutes clitonem Eadwium, regis Eadmund igermanum, et Eadwium, qui rex appellabatur rusticorum, exlegavit\"). He goes on to say that the King of the Churls was reconciled to Cnut, as I have already said, but that the \u00c6theling was treacherously murdered within the year by Cnut's order (\" Eadwius vero clito, deceptus illorum insidiis quos eotenus amicissimos habuit, jussu et petitione regis Canuti, eodem anno innocenter occiditur\"). This account, which is perhaps really the same as the other, is of course founded on the Abingdon Chronicle. William of Malmesbury (ii. 180) has quite another story, which recognizes the outlawry, but makes the \u00c6theling die a natural death. \" Frater ejus [Edmundi] ex matre Edwius, non adspernand\u00e6 probitatis adolescens, per proditorem Edricum Anglia, jubente Cnutone, cessit ; diu terris jactatus et alto, angore animi ut fit corpus infectus, dum furtivo reditu inter Anglos delitescit, defungitur, et apud Tavistokium tumulatur.\""], [767, "THE ORIGIN OF EARL GODWINE. 719 Now we must choose between these stories. The authority of Florence, backed as to the main outline of the tale by the Abingdon Chronicle, is in itself much higher than that of William of Malmesbury. But Florence's authority is in this case somewhat lessened by the confused way in which he tells the story twice over. Also tales of secret conferences and assassinations are always suspicious, and they are specially suspicious when they bring in the name of Eadric. If Eadwig died anyhow soon after his outlawry, people would be sure to say that he was made away with by Cnut and Eadric. But if he really was so made away with, it is hard to see how the story in William of Malmesbury could arise. Also, if Eadwig was outlawed, and therefore banished, it is hard to see how even Eadric would have the chance of murdering him, unless it is meant that he was treacherously pursued during his days of grace, as Godwine is said to have been (see vol. ii. c. vii). It can hardly mean that the hand of Eadric could reach banished men in foreign lands. The character of Cnut, at this stage of his career, throws no light on the matter either way. But it is amusing to see Thierry turning the particular promise of Cnut to \u00c6thelweard into a general advertisement for the heads of his enemies ; \" ' Qui m'apportera la tete d'un de mes ennemis,' disait le roi danois avec la ferocite d'un pirate, 'me sera plus cher que s'il etait mon frere.'\" NOTE ZZ. p. 409. The Origin of Earl Godwine. The prominent position of Godwine at the time of Cnut's death is one of the most conspicuous facts of our history, and the com bined evidence of the charters and of the Biographer of Eadward has enabled me to trace up his greatness to the earliest days of Cnut's reign. But, when we ask for the birth and parentage of the man who became the greatest of English subjects, who so nearly became the father of a new line of English kings, we find ourselves involved in utter obscurity and contradiction. Was he the son of Child Wulfnoth the South-Saxon (see above, p. 663) ? Was he the great-nephew of the arch-traitor Eadric 1 Or was he"], [768, "APPENDIX. 720 the son of a churl somewhere near Sherstone, introduced by the Dane Ulf to the favour of Cnut ? Or is it possible that none of these accounts rests on any sure foundation, and that we must remain altogether in the dark as to the birth of Godwine and the events of his early life 1 I will begin with the one fact which appears to be certain, that is the name of Godwine's father. While the accounts of him agree in nothing else, all who mention his father at all agree in giving him the name of Wulfnoth. (It is hardly worth while to mention that Fordun, v. II, makes Godwine a son of Eadric.) I have therefore not scrupled to speak in the text of Godwine the son of Wulfnoth. Still, as Godwine was one of the commonest names at the time, it is not safe to assume every Godwine, or even every Wulfnoth, whom we come across to be the Godwine and the Wulfnoth with whom we are concerned. But any case in which the two names come together is at least worthy of notice. There is absolutely no evidence whether any of the many signatures of various Godwines in the later days of \u00c6thelred belong to the great Earl or not. But when the \u00c6theling \u00c6thelstan, in his will (Cod. Dipl. iii. 363), makes bequests to two Godwines, and distinguishes one of them as the son of Wulfnoth, this raises a strong presumption, though it does not reach positive proof, that our Godwine is the Godwine intended. And, if the expressions of the bequest fall in with any circumstances in any of the accounts of Godwine, we reach, though still not quite positive proof, yet certainly the highest degree of probability. What then is our available evidence on the subject ? Our own historians, as far as direct statement goes, are silent. Godwine appears in the Chronicles as Earl of the West-Saxons and as chief supporter of Harthacnut, without any hint as to who he was. The writers who speak of his exploits in the time of Cnut are equally silent. Even his own panegyrist, the Biographer of Eadward, has nothing whatever to tell us as to his origin. The silence of the Chronicles is not wonderful; they commonly take people's position for granted, and introduce them without any particular description. But the absence of any direct statement in all our authorities, good and bad, is certainly remarkable, and the silence of Godwine's own special admirer, the Biographer of Eadward, is very remarkable indeed."], [769, "THE ORIGIN OF EARL GODWINE. 721 But, though none of our own historians introduces Godwine as the son or nephew of Wulfnoth, or of Eadric, or of any one else, yet we have, on authority which seems at first sight to be irre- sistible, two statements that a Wulfnoth was the father of Godwine, one statement that Eadric was the great-uncle of Godwine. Florence (anno 1007), in a passage which I have discussed in other Notes (see pp. 655, 663), says that one of Eadric's brothers was named \u00c6thelm\u00e6r, and that \u00c6thelm\u00e6r was the father of Wulfnoth, the father of Earl Godwine. The Canterbury Chronicle (anno 1008) describes Child Wulfnoth the South-Saxon as \"Godwines f\u00e6der eorles.\" Most writers put these two statements together, and assume Godwine to be the son of Child Wulfnoth and Child Wulfnoth to be the nephew of Eadric. To me it seems that the two accounts are quite distinct, and that their statements are almost irreconcileable. Florence, who speaks of Godwine the son of Wulfnoth as the nephew of Eadric, does not say that Godwine was the son of Child Wulfnoth, nor does he in any way identify Child Wulfnoth with Wulfnoth the nephew of Eadric. The Canterbury Chronicler, who makes Godwine the son of Child Wulfnoth, is equally silent as to any kindred between Child Wulfnoth and Eadric. In fact, the way in which they write seems to shut out \u2014 perhaps is designedly meant to shut out \u2014 any such kindred either way. Florence speaks of \" Wlnothus, pater West-Saxonum ducis Godwini ; \" directly afterwards he speaks of \" Suth-Saxonicus minister Wlnothus.\" This is the way in which a man would speak of two distinct Wulfnoths, not of the same. He says that \" Brihtric, brother of Eadric, unjustly accused Child Wulfnoth.\" This is not the way in which he would speak of a charge brought by one member of the family of which he had just given the pedigree against another member of the same family. Prima facie then, the Wulfnoth spoken of under 1007 and the Wulfnoth spoken of under 1008 are two different persons. Nor is it enough to say that, in the entry under 1008, Florence is translating the Worcester Chronicle, and that he keeps its language without trying to harmonize it with what he had himself just before said. Florence is here not merely translating, for he stops to put in a character of Brihtric of his own composition. It is certain that Florence cannot be quoted on behalf of the view that Godwine was the son of Child Wulfnoth ; he seems indeed vol. 1. 3 a"], [770, "APPENDIX. 722 designedly to exclude any such parentage by distinguishing one Wulfnoth from the other. The three elder Chronicles, Abingdon, Worcester, Peterborough, give us no information either way. Godwine's name does not occur in any of them till after the death of Cnut. The Abingdon Chronicle, in describing Wulfnoth, calls him simply \"WulfnoS cild.\" To this description the Worcester and Peterborough Chronicles add \"pone SuSseaxscian ; \" the Canterbury Chronicler adds again, \" Godwines f\u00e6der eorles.\" All the Chroniclers knew, and they all thought it right to state, that Brihtric was the brother of Eadric ; that he was the uncle of the man whom he was accusing, a fact surely quite as important, is not implied in any way. The combined evidence of all the Chronicles seems to me to go to distinguish Child Wulfnoth the South-Saxon from any Wulfnoth who was nephew to Eadric. The evidence of Florence goes the same way. As to the parentage of Godwine the three elder Chroniclers are silent. Florence affirms him to have been the son of Wulfnoth the nephew of Eadric; the Canterbury Chronicler affirms him to have been the son of Child Wulfnoth the South-Saxon. I do not say that these two statements are logically contradictory ; but it certainly seems to me that, as a matter of historical evidence, they are very hard to reconcile. Now which of these two accounts is the more probable 1 As far as authority goes, they are much on a level. Neither statement is strictly contemporary; indeed both of them are statements which in their own nature could not be contemporary; Wulfnoth, whoever he was, is described by a form which could not have been used till long after, when his son had become far more famous than himself. Each description is a mere insertion into an earlier text ; each may be a mere hasty inference from likeness of name. The authority of Florence on such a matter is quite equal to that of the Canter bury Chronicle, the latest and least authoritative of the four. His statement too, as part of an insertion of some length, describing the character and family of Eadric, has more the air of a deli berately advised statement than the three words of the Canterbury Chronicler, which might have been inserted currente calamo. On the other hand, the statement of Florence is most unlikely in itself, while that of the Canterbury Chronicler has some external support of a very remarkable kind."], [771, "THE ORIGIN OF EARL GODWINE. 723 If we admit that Godwine was the great-nephew of Eadric, we are at once plunged into all kinds of chronological difficulties and into the strangest of family relations. Eadric was put to death in 1017 ; there is nothing to show that he was at all an aged man, rather the contrary. Godwine must have been at least a grown man in 1018, when he was already an Earl. Is it possible that Godwine was two generations younger than Eadric 1 Again, Eadric married Eadgyth the daughter of \u00c6thelred ; Eadward the son of \u00c6thelred married Eadgyth the daughter of Godwine. Eadric may well have been a good deal older than his wife, who, as the daughter of a man who was born in 969, must have been young, and may have been almost a child, in 1007, the probable year of her marriage (see above, p. 658). Eadgyth again must have been some years older than her half-brother Eadward, who was born between 1002 and 1005 (see p. 686). Eadward again must have been much older than his wife Eadgyth, whose parents were married in 10 19 (see p. 423). Still, allowing for all this, can we conceive a man marrying the great-great-niece of his own brother-in-law 1 The pedigree would stand thus ; \u00c6thelric \u00c6thelred I -1- -, I -L -, \u00c6thelm\u00e6r Eadric = Eadgyth Eadward. Wulfnoth I Godwine 1 Eadgyth. Eadward may easily have been twenty years older than his wife, but can we believe that he belonged to the same generation as his wife's great-grandfather 1 This seems to me to be a strong objection to the statement of Florence. On the other hand, the statement of the Canterbury Chronicle curiously falls in with the bequest in the will of the \u00c6theling \u00c6thelstan; \"Ic gean Godwine WulfnoSes suna Ses landes \u00e6t Cumtiine, Se his feder \u00e6r ahte.\" Why should \u00c6thelstan leave Godwine the land which his father had 1 The bequest fol lows immediately on one in which the \u00c6theling leaves to one \u00c6lfm\u00e6r the land which had formerly been his own (\" Ic gean \u00c6lmere Ses landes \u00e6t Hamelande S\u00e6 he \u00e6r ahte\"). And this is followed by a very earnest prayer to his father to confirm the grant to \u00c6lfm\u00e6r (\"Ic bidde minne feder for Godes \u00e6lmihtiges 3 A2"], [772, "724 APPENDIX. lufan and for minon, S\u00e6t he Ses geunne Se ic him geunnen hebbe\"), which is not attached to any of his other bequests. Some special cause evidently lurks under such bequests as these. They naturally suggest the idea that the lands bequeathed were confiscated lands which \u00c6thelstan thought it right to restore, in the one case to the former owner himself, in the other case to the former owner's son. Now the lands of Child Wulfnoth would doubtless be confiscated after his doings in 1009, and a part of them might easily come into the possession of the \u00c6theling. For a possession of Child Wulfnoth the South-Saxon we naturally look in his own shire. And Domesday shows us two South-Saxon Comptons, one of them held by Harold (21), the other held by a tenant of Earl Godwine (24). Here is indeed no actual proof, but there is a remarkable series of undesigned coincidences in favour of the belief that Godwine was the son of Child Wulfnoth the South-Saxon, and therefore, as I think, against the belief that he was the great nephew of Eadric. This evidence, if it stood alone, would probably be thought quite conclusive ; but there is another account of Godwine's birth, which we could hardly, in any case, accept in its literal shape, but the existence of which is, in any case, a ph\u00e6nomenon to be accounted for, and which, when stripped of its romantic details, is in itself by no means devoid of likelihood. This is that Godwine was the son of a churl near the field of Sherstone or elsewhere. This version appears in several places and in several forms, and it seems to come from more than one independent source of tradition. We hear of it alike in English, in Danish, and in Norman writers. Thus, while some Norman writers, as William of Jumieges (viii. 9), speak of Godwine's nobility, Wace (Roman de Rou, 9809) expressly calls him \" Quens Gwine, Ki mult esteit de pute orine.' Among English writers it is first found in a writer of Henry the First's time, whose accounts of things, though often very strange, are always independent. This is the chronicler whose work is printed in Mr. Edwards' Liber de Hyda. In his account of God wine, against whom he is bitterly prejudiced, he says (p. 288), \" Fuit nempe ex infimo Anglorum genere ... et licet per omnes fere Angli\u00e6 partes potestas ejus extenderetur, principalis tamen"], [773, "THE ORIGIN OF EARL GODWINE. 725 comitatus ejus Australis erat, regio qu\u00e6 lingua eorum dicitur Sud sexia.\" So Ralph the Black, a chronicler of no great value who wrote early in the thirteenth century, distinctly asserts the peasant origin of Godwine. His whole story is full of mythical elements, still it is of some importance, because some of the statements in it clearly do not come from the common sources. His story runs thus (p. 160); \" Godwinus Gomes filius bubulcifuit; in mensa regis Edwardi offa suffocates est, et ab Haraldo filio sub mensa extractus. Hie Godwinus, a rege Cnutone nutritus, processu temporis in Daciam cum breve regis transmissus, callide duxit sororem Cnuto nis.\" (See Note EEE.) One of the fullest accounts among those which assert Godwine's lowly origin, and that which has met with most attention from modern writers, is the picturesque tale in the Knytlinga Saga (c. ii ; Johnstone, p. 131). Earl Ulf, pursuing the flying English at Sherstone, loses his way. He meets a youth driving cattle, who tells him that his name is Godwine (Gudini), and whom he asks to show him his way to the Danish ships. Godwine speaks of the difficulty of so doing, when the whole country is so enraged against the Danes ; he refuses the Earl's offered gift of a gold ring, but says that he will do what he can for him, and that, if he suc ceeds, Ulf may reward him at his pleasure. He then takes the Earl to the house of his father Wulfnoth (Ulfnad), who is described as a rich yeoman (bondi), living in very comfortable style. The Earl is well entertained, especially with good drink ; he is greatly pleased with the house and its inhabitants, old and young, and stays the whole of the next day there in great comfort. At night Ulf and Godwine are mounted on two good horses, well capa risoned. Wulfnoth and his wife remind Ulf of the dangerous errand on which they are sending their only son, and they trust to his gratitude for a recompense. The Earl is charmed with the handsome countenance and ready speech of the youth ; they ride all night, and reach Cnut's ships the next morning. Ulf treats Godwine as his son, places him by his side, gives him his sister Gytha in marriage, presents him to Cnut, and procures for him the dignity of Earl. Here we have a story which, whatever else we say of it, at least fits in with the chronology of the time. It must be a confused or perverted shape of the same tradition when Walter Map (199)"], [774, "726 APPENDIX. tells a story in which the part of Ulf is assigned to King \u00c6thelred. The King loses his way in hunting, and comes alone at night to ask shelter in the house of his neat-herd (\" ad domus cujusdam cus todis vaccarum suarum \"). The neat-herd's son Godwine (\" impiger filius custodis, puer nomine Godwinus, pulchrior et melior quam ipsi daret linea priorum \") does all kinds of services for the royal guest, and specially provides him with a supper which would seem to imply a boundless appetite on the part of the unready King. He thus wins the King's heart, who presently promotes him in every way, makes him a knight, and gives him the earldom of Glouces ter (\"tulit ergo ipsum rex in thalamum suum, et processu temporis sublimavit super omnes principes regni, et cum cingulo militi\u00e6 comitatum ei Gloucestri\u00e6 contulit \"). The \" bubulci filius \" shows all manner of natural gifts in his new elevation, and makes himself famous among both Christians and Saracens. He is above all things protector of the English coast, freeing it from pirates, and making England the terror of all nations, instead of being, as she had been before him, the common prey of all of them (\"pererrabat omnes Angli\u00e6 portus, turn terra turn mari, piratas omnes destruens ; et facta est Anglia per ejus operam timor omnium circum jacentium terrarum qu\u00e6 fuerat earum direptio et pr\u00e6da \"). Presently Cnut comes, invited, according to this writer's story, by the English themselves (see above, p. 693). The story of the war is told with great confusion, but Godwine appears (204) as the chief supporter of Eadmund (\" At in hac quid fecit Godwinus tempestate 1 Multa et valida manu militum collecta, Edmundum Edelredi filium advocavit, et properanti contra eos occurrant Chnuto apud Durherst in valle Gloucestri\u00e6 super Sabrinam \"). Then comes the story of the single combat of Cnut and Eadmund (see above, p. 706). Now, what are we to make of these stories 1 The one which is most likely to be true in its main features is that in the Knyt linga Saga ; but the saga is a saga, and I have given some specimens of its inaccuracies and confusions. In this very story it would be hard to reconcile the author's conception of the battle of Sherstone with the truth of history; Godwine also was not the only son of his parents, as we shall in course of time hear of his brother (see Edwards, Introduction to Liber de Hyda, xxxvii. ; Mon. Angl. ii. 428, 430); and it is more amazing still when the saga goes on to tell us that Godwine and Gytha were the parents, not only of"], [775, "THE ORIGIN OF EARL GODWINE. 727 Swegen, Harold, and Tostig, but also of Morkere and Waltheof. Such a tale is not history; the utmost amount of credit which I should ever think of giving it would be to admit it as evidence of a tradition that Godwine was not of illustrious birth, that he was by origin ceorl and not eorl, and that he was in some way con nected with Earl Ulf. The details might be devised to account for an Englishman of lowly birth marrying the sister of the great Danish Earl. We may, I think, be sure that the real legend is that which attributes Godwine's rise to a service done to Ulf, and that the story of Walter Map which puts \u00c6thelred instead of Ulf is a later version. Nothing can be wilder than Walter's general story, but we may be inclined to believe that he preserves a piece of genuine history when he speaks of Godwine's services towards \u00c6thelred and Eadmund. This agrees in a remarkable way with the bequest and the will of \u00c6thelstan, if we take that as referring to Godwine the Earl. The account in Ralph the Black is most likely an abridgement of that in Walter Map, as both use the same words (\"bubulci filius \"), and both tell the same story of Godwine's marriage (see below, p. 746), which is quite different from that in the Knytlinga Saga. Yet we may take Ralph's words (\" a rege Cnutone nutritus \") as a correction of Walter's story about \u00c6thel red. The account in the Hyde writer is remarkable on two grounds. It asserts Godwine to have been of low birth ; it also, like the Canterbury Chronicle, specially connects him with Sussex, while most of the later writers specially connect him with Kent. On the other hand, if any one ventures to put any faith in the geo graphy of the Knytlinga Saga, Godwine must have come from some place near the borders of Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. Walter Map does not mention any particular place, but, according to his usual practice of drawing everything to his own side of England, makes Godwine Earl, not of Kent or Sussex, but of Gloucester. We have then a distinct tradition, turning up in several quarters, some of which at least seem to be independent of one another, which tradition asserts Godwine to have been a man of churlish birth. Taking the story in the Knytlinga Saga as the genuine form of the legend, the English writers and Wace exaggerate, as in such a case they were sure to do, the lowliness of Godwine's origin. So do the only modern writers who adopt the story. These are Sharon Turner (Hist. Angl. Sax. ii. 494)- who talks about \" poverty,\""], [776, "APPENDIX. 728 \"humble mansion,\" &c, and Thierry (i. 160), who talks about a \" cabane.\" But the Wulfnoth of the saga is not a poor man ; he is a ceorl and not a thegn ; but he has everything good about him, good house, good drink, good horses. His treatment of Ulf seems to be his usual way of entertaining strangers, while the astonishing supper given to \u00c6thelred in Walter Map's version is a special effort for the purpose. In the Danish writer's picture, Wulfnoth is, in modern phrase, not a labourer, not even a tenant farmer, but clearly a rich yeoman. Such a man might, in the England of those days, easily rise to thegn's rank (see p. 90). Eadric had risen from such a rank, or very possibly from a lowlier one (see above, p. 655), to be Ealdorman of the Mercians and son-in-law of the King. Still the rise from the yeoman's com fortable house to the earldom of the West-Saxons in one generation and to the throne of England in the next is not an every-day event. How far is such an exaltation probable in the present case 2 I assume that the story of the Knytlinga Saga is altogether irreconcileable with either of the others. Sharon Turner indeed, like Florence in some of his weaker moments, adopts all three stories at once. He accepts the pedigree given by Florence without hesitation, and seemingly without thinking it at all con tradictory to the tale of Godwine's lowly origin. That tale he adopts in its fulness, and he does his best to weave the two together. He even conceives Wulfnoth in his humble estate as probably remembering the high fortunes of his uncle Eadric, and hoping that a similar good luck may attend his own child. Some what earlier, in recording the story of Brihtric and Wulfnoth, Mr. Turner calls the latter \" the father of Earl Godwine,\" and, though he remarks in a note that the words are absent from some MSS. of the Chronicles, he does not appear to doubt Child Wulfnoth's paternity. Now it would be remarkable if a nephew of the power ful Eadric remained in the condition of a herdsman or even in that of a yeoman, while Eadric himself had risen to such greatness, and had raised at least one of his brothers with him. Yet this, how ever unlikely, is at least possible. But possibility itself can hardly be stretched so far as to make Wulfnoth the naval commander of 1009 the same as Wulfnoth the yeoman of 1016. Doubtless princes and lords, under the frown of fortune, have before now lurked in"], [777, "THE ORIGIN OF EARL GODWINE. 729 much lowlier disguises ; but one who, outlaw as he was, still had twenty ships at his bidding, was far more likely to take service under King Swegen or to go on with his doings as wiking on his own account, than to betake himself to the tilth of the ground in a western shire. I think we may safely assert that, if Godwine was the son of a West of England yeoman, he was certainly not the son of the South-Saxon naval captain, and was not likely to be the grand-nephew of Ealdorman Eadric. And now, what is the measure of likelihood in the story itself 1 First of all, what is always of no small consequence in these ques- tions, if we grant the truth of the tale in its main outlines, we can understand how the other tale arose, while the reverse process is by no means so easy. For, if the tale of the Knytlinga Saga be a fiction, it must be pure invention without motive. One does not see how any confusion or misconception can have led to it. The story of Godwine's lowly birth is not introduced in the saga, what- ever we say of Wace and the Hyde writer, with the least notion of depreciating him. One therefore hardly sees why any one should go out of his way to invent the tale. But if there were several contemporary Wulfnoth s, especially if the real one was an obscure person, mere misconception might lead Florence or his informants to fasten the paternity upon the wrong Wulfnoth. Or, if falsifica- tion is supposed, its motives are much more obvious than in the other case. To connect Godwine either with Eadric or with Child Wulfnoth would suit foes who wish to brand one whom they called a traitor as the kinsman of earlier traitors. It might suit Danish friends to represent him as connected with one who had so great a share in setting up the Danish throne in England. And, as Eadric, with all his crimes, was clearly the leader of a powerful party, the invention might even suit some among Godwine's English friends, who might still regard a connexion with Eadric as conferring more of honour than of shame. Again, if we accept the legend in the saga, we can understand the rather mysterious way in which Godwine himself comes on the stage under the patronage of Cnut and Ulf, better than if we suppose him to have been a member of a powerful English family. We can especially understand the astonishing silence of his own panegyrist. If Godwine had been a scion of any eminent family, or had been of kin to any famous, or even infamous, men, we"], [778, "730 APPENDIX. should surely, somewhere or other, find him described accordingly. But the mass of writers, as we have seen, are utterly silent; no one introduces him with any description at all ; those who connect him with Eadric or with Child Wulfnoth do it backwards ; they de scribe Wulfnoth as the father of Godwine, not Godwine as the son of Wulfnoth. I think then that, if this story stood by itself, there would be little difficulty in accepting it. I mean of course in accepting the general outline of the tale, namely that Godwine was a yeoman's son who had somehow attracted the favour of Ulf, and who was by him introduced to Cnut. Details are quite another matter. The whole narrative of the war of Cnut and Eadmund in the Knytlinga Saga is so utterly confused and unhistorical that nothing can be safely said as to time, place, or circumstance. And the story in Walter Map, as far as concerns the first rise of Godwine, is even wilder than the saga itself. But the tradition of Godwine's churlish origin, taken by itself, would have much to be said for it. I am inclined to think that it might hold its ground against the version in Florence. But the statement of the Canterbury Chronicler, backed up by the will of \u00c6thelstan, is a more formid able opponent. The two descriptions fit singularly well into one another, and the coincidence is, on the face of it, undesigned. It is of course possible that Godwine the son of Wulfnoth and legatee of \u00c6thelstan may not have been the great Earl ; it is possible that, being the great Earl, he may have been the son of some other Wulfnoth, and not of the South-Saxon Child. But when we put together the Canterbury Chronicle, the will of \u00c6thelstan, and the entries in Domesday, their cumulative force is so great as to make such explanations mere possibilities and no more. If we accept the will as referring to the great Godwine, and if we further accept my conjecture as to the death of \u00c6thelstan (see above, p. 700), we may look on Godwine as a brave young warrior, whose services had, even before the death of \u00c6thelred, entitled him in the \u00c6theling's opinion to a restitution of the lands forfeited by his father. This same conception of him, which might well be genuine tradition, appears in an exaggerated form in the version of Walter Map. This view of him is in no way inconsistent with the fact of the favour which he afterwards found with Ulf and Cnut. Neither is his favour with Ulf and Cnut inconsistent with"], [779, "THE WEST-SAXON EARLDOM. 731 the story of his yeoman origin, but quite the reverse. The main difficulty, one which I do not see the way to get over, is that Wulfnoth the churl and Child Wulfnoth the South-Saxon cannot be the same man. The two stories thus become alternatives between which we must choose. Godwine was either the son of Child Wulfnoth, or the son of Wulfnoth the churl; in neither case do I believe him to have been the great-nephew of Eadric. I once inclined, of course with the necessary allowances, to the story in the Knyt linga Saga ; I had not then weighed the arguments suggested by the will of \u00c6thelstan and the entries in Domesday. On the strength of these last I now incline to the statement of the Canterbury Chronicler. But I leave the critical reader to decide. NOTE AAA. pp. 409, 425. The West-Saxon Earldom. There is, I think, quite evidence to show that Godwine was raised to Earl's rank very early in the reign of Cnut, but that he was not invested with the vast government of which we afterwards find him in possession till some years later. I do not try to identify any of the signatures of \" Godwine minister \" in the later days of \u00c6thelred. There are a good many of them, and some of them may be signatures of the great Earl ; but the name Godwine is so common that it is utterly impossible to say anything either way. But Godwine undoubtedly signs as Earl from the very beginning of Cnut's reign. The earliest charters of Cnut are of the year 1018, and Godwine signs one of these (Cod. Dipl. iv. 3) as \"dux,\" though seemingly, as one would expect, as the junior Earl. But, as Cnut kept Wessex in his own hands, while he appointed Earls over Northumberland and Mercia, Godwine could not have been Earl over all Wessex so early as this. He must have been simply the local Earl of some one shire. That shire may have been Kent. He is called Earl of Kent by Eadmer (\" Canti\u00e6 comes magnanimus,\" p. 4), and it is his usual description in later accounts. But writers who did not take in the position of an Earl of the West-Saxons, and who"], [780, "732 APPENDIX. did not understand that his jurisdiction took in Kent, may have called Godwine Earl of Kent simply because they found him acting as Earl at Dover in 1051. And, on the other hand, we have just seen (see above, p. 727) that there were other versions which call his first earldom Sussex, and even Gloucester. I do not pretend to settle the question, and it is of no great moment. The one important point is that Godwine was raised to high rank in the very beginning of Cnut's reign, and was raised to higher rank still somewhat later. That Godwine at a later time, under Harthacnut and Eadward, held an earldom which took in all AYessex \u2014 that is the old kingdoms of Wessex, Kent, and Sussex \u2014 there is no doubt. He appears as the immediate ruler of Wessex from the death of Cnut onward, and he is distinctly called \" West-Saxonum dux\" (Fl. Wig. 104 1 ; cf. 1009). It might indeed be thought that his pro motion to this greater government did not take place till after the death of Cnut, when Godwine acted as the minister of the absent Harthacnut. But it is clear from the Biographer of Eadward (392) that he was raised to some special rank by Cnut at the time which I have stated in the text. He attracted Cnut's notice from the very beginning. \" Ubi . . . regnum cessit Cnuto regi vario eventu bellorum, inter novos adepti regni prin cipes regio adscitos lateri, hie Godwinus . . . probates est.\" This quite falls in with his signature as Earl in 10 18. But after Cnut's visit to Denmark in 1019, after Godwine's exploits and his marriage (see pp. 422-424, and Note DDD), we read, \"Quum repatriaret [Cnutus] in Angliam, feliciter actis omnibus, totius pene regni ab ipso constituitur dux et bajulus.\" So in the next page we read, \"Regnante supradicto Cnuto rege, floruit hie in ejus aula primus inter summos regni proceres ; et agente \u00e6quitatis ratione, quod scribebat scriptum, quod delebat omnes censebant delendum. Et in hujus potentatus solio potenter viguit, donee et hunc regem et ejus totam stirpem Ille qui regna pro libitu suo transfert succidit.\" That is, in plain words, Cnut on his return to England in 1020 invested Godwine with an office which made him the first man in the kingdom, and which he kept through the reigns of Cnut's sons. It was therefore from Cnut and in 1020 that Godwine received the office which we find him holding under Harthacnut, that of \" West-Saxonum dux.\" The charters"], [781, "THE MARRIAGE OF CNUT AND EMMA. 733 tell the same tale. From 1019 onwards (see Cod. Dipl. iv. 9 et seqq.; vi. 179 et seqq.) Godwine always signs before every other Englishman, while in 1018 (iv. 3) \u00c6thelweard signed before him. For a while (iv. 9, 14, 17, 29) we find some of Cnut's Danish Earls and kinsmen, Thurkill or Eric, signing before him, but Godwine always signs among them, and gradually, as Cnut's government became more and more English, it became the estab lished'rule for Godwine to sign at the head of the laymen. That Godwine then was Earl of the West- Saxons uninterruptedly from 1020 to 1051 there can I think be no doubt. Of the nature of the office and the policy of the appointment I have spoken in the text. It is plain that it was something quite new, something quite different from the ordinary eafdormanship of a shire in Kent or elsewhere. \" Bajulus,\" the word used by the Biographer here and afterwards in p. 401 to express Godwine's position, exactly answers to the Eastern Vizier, and the title is specially common in Sicily and the Levant. But the word is the parent of all the various forms of bailiff, bail, and such like. See Ducange in Bajulus, and Roque fort, Glossaire de la Langue Romane, in Bailleul. Thierry has an amusing glimmering of truth when he says (i. 168), \"Apres une grande victoire remportee sur les Norwegiens, Godwin obtint la dignite d'earl, ou chef politique de l'ancien royaume de West-Sex, reduit alors ct Vt-tat de province!' He saw by some happy instinct, for the Life of Eadward was not then published, that Godwine's great promotion followed on his exploits in the North ; but he turned Godwine's enemies, who are in every account called either Swedes or Wends, into Norwegians, and he placed the appointment between 1030 and 1035, after Cnut's con quest of Norway. Moreover, of all Cnut's dominions Wessex was just the part which was the furthest from being reduced to the form of a province. NOTE BBB. p. 410. The Marriage or Cnut and Emma. Cnut's first wife or concubine is incidentally mentioned in the three principal Chronicles under 1035, in describing the accession"], [782, "734 APPENDIX. of her supposed son Harold. According to Abingdon and Wor cester, \"Harold s\u00e6de p\u00e6t he Cnutes sunu w\u00e6re and p\u00e6re ocSre \u00c6lfgyfe [\u00c6lfgyfe jj\u00e6re Hamtunisca. Wig.], peh hit na soS n\u00e6re.\" Peterborough has, \" Sume men s\u00e6don be Harolde p\u00e6t he w\u00e6re Cnutes sunu cynges and \u00c6lfgive \u00c6lfelmes dohtor ealdormannes ; ac hit puhte swiSe ungeleaflic manegum mannum.\" We thus learn that \"the other \u00c6lfgifu\" was daughter of the murdered Ealdorman \u00c6lfhelm and that she was known as \u00c6lfgifu of Northampton. We also learn that the alleged parentage of her son Harold was generally doubted. Florence (1035) in describing the succession of Swegen in Norway and of Harold in England, calls their supposed mother \" Northamtunensis Alfgiva, filia videlicet Alfhelmi ducis et nobilis matron\u00e6 Wlfrun\u00e6.\" He goes on to mention the popular belief which I have mentioned in the text at p. 411. William of Malmesbury (ii. 188) says, \" Haroldus, quem fama filium Cnutonis ex filia Elfelmi comitis loquebatur.\" There is in all this no hint that \u00c6lfgifu of Northampton was in any sense Cnut's wife ; but Roger of Wendover, who elsewhere (i. 473) calls her \"Algiva concubina,\" says (i. 462), \"Anno Domini mxviii. obiit Algiva, Elfelmi Comitis filia et uxor regis Cnutonis, ex qua duos habuit filios, Suanum videlicet et Haroldum, licet alii dicant eos ex fornicatione generates.\" He then adds, \"Misit ergo Cnuto in Normanniam ad ducem Ricardum propter Emmam sororem suam,\" &c. The Chronica Regis Cnutonis in the Liber de Hyda (267), which is followed by Roger of Wendover with a good many changes, calls her \" Elgiva uxor sua regina,\" and directly after says, \"defuncta uxore Cnutonis regis, Elfgiva nomine, idem rex misit in Normanniam,\" as in Roger. Bromton too (906) first calls her \" concubina,\" and perverts her name into Ailena ; but afterwards (934) she, for it must be the same, is Cnut's \" prima uxor sive amasia.\" In the Knytlinga Saga (c. 16) Swegen appears as the son of Cnut and \"Alfifa,\" as he also does in Snorro (Laing, ii. 344 et seqq.), according to whom \u00c6lfgifu survived Cnut and governed Norway in the name of her son. So Saxo (196) calls Swegen \"quem ex Alvina sustulerat.\" He had before (192) spoken of her as the mistress, first of Saint Olaf, then of Cnut. \" Eodem tempore Alwinam ab Olavo adamatam, Canutes eximia matron\u00e6"], [783, "THE MARRIAGE OF CNUT AND EMMA. 735 specie delectatus, stupro petiit.\" Olaf is thereby \"concubin\u00e6 facibus spoliates.\" As far as one can make anything out of Saxo's chronology, this is just after the battle of Assandun. The Encomiast, in recording Emma's care, before she marries Cnut, to secure the succession for her own children, says incident ally (ii. 1 6), \"dicebatur enim ab alia quadam rex filios habuisse.\" Again, in iii. i, when recording the accession of Harold, he describes him as \" quemdam Haroldum, quem esse filium \u00e6stima tione asseritur cujusdam ejusdem regis Cnutonis concubin\u00e6 ; plurimorum vero assertio eumdem Haroldum perhibet furtim fuisse subreptum parturienti ancill\u00e6, impositum autem camer\u00e6 languentis concubin\u00e6. Quod veracius credi potest.\" Notwithstanding the pious care of Roger of Wendover and the Hyde writer to marry this \u00c6lfgifu to Cnut, and to kill her off before his marriage with Emma, there can be no doubt that she was at most a Danish wife after the manner of Popa and Sprota (see pp. 206, 253), that she was alive at the time of Emma's marriage, and that she survived Cnut. Moreover, if Cnut's connexion with \u00c6lfgifu began when Saxo says it did, one at least of her sons must have been born after Emma's marriage. Cnut, it is to be supposed, reformed in these matters, as in others. The Ramsey historian (c. 80; Gale, p. 437) calls him \"usus venerei parcus,\" and in his Laws (51-57, Thorpe, i. 404-6) he is strict against all breaches of chastity. And now for the marriage with Emma. There is indeed some thing very strange about the whole thing. William of Malmesbury (ii. 1 80) is uncertain whether Emma or her brother Richard was most disgraced by the marriage. \" Ignores majore illius dedecore qui dederit, an femin\u00e6 qu\u00e6 consenserit ut thalamo illius caleret qui virum infestaverit, filios effugaverit.\" Not to enter into this delicate question, it is worth noticing that Cnut was now about twenty-two, while Emma, married in 1002, could not have been under thirty, and considering the ages of her parents, the daughter of Richard and Gunnor may have been much older. The Scan dinavian writers are not startled at a much greater disparity of years, as they boldly make Emma the mother of all the children of \u00c6thelred. (See above, p. 688.) According to the Knytlinga Saga (Johnstone, 129), Emma was in England at the moment of \u00c6thelred's death, upon which she prepared to leave the country,"], [784, "APPENDIX. 736 but Cnut persuaded her to stay and marry him. The war of Cnut and Eadmund is therefore, according to this view, war between a stepfather and a stepson. I need not go about to show that Eadmund was not the son of Emma, and it is equally certain that Cnut did not marry Emma till July 1017, eight months after the death of Eadmund, and that she was in Normandy at the time of Cnut's proposal. But that she was in England at the time of \u00c6thelred's death (as is distinctly affirmed by R. Howden, ii. 240), and that Cnut saw her during the course of the war, is quite possible. See above, p. 700. As to her coming to England, there is something amusing in the form of words employed, with some slight variations, by all the English Chroniclers ; \" And pa toforan Kal. Augusti het se cyng feccean him p\u00e6s oSres kynges lafe \u00c6Sel redes him to wife, Ricardes dohtor.\" She signs Cnut's charters from this time, beginning in 10 18, sometimes as Emma, but more commonly as \u00c6lfgifu. In Cod. Dipl. iv. 9 she is \" \u00c6lfgive thoro consecrata regio.\" According to William of Malmesbury (ii. 196), Emma not only hated the memory of \u00c6thelred, which is not very wonderful, but extended her dislike to her children by him ; \" h\u00e6reditario scilicet odio parentis in prolem, nam magis Cnutonem et amaverat vivum et laudabat defunctum.\" This account receives a most singular confirmation from the language of her Encomiast, from which it is plain that she wished her first marriage to be utterly forgotten. Not a hint is allowed to escape the courtly panegyrist which might imply that Emma had any earlier connexion with England, or that she had ever been married to \u00c6thelred or to any other man. Cnut, after he had established himself in England and had got rid of Eadric (\"omnibus rite dispositis,\" ii. 16, cf. c. 15), wanted a wife worthy to be the partner of his Empire (\" ut inventam hanc legaliter adquireret et adeptam Imperii sui consortem faceret\"). He sends and seeks through many kingdoms and cities, but no help-meet for him is found (\" longe lateque qu\u00e6sita, vix tandem digna reperitur\"). At last the Imperial bride is found (\" inventa est h\u00e6c Imperialis sponsa\") in Normandy ; Cnut, we are told, specially preferred the Norman connexion, because the Normans were a victorious people who had established themselves in Gaul by force of arms (\" pro hoc pr\u00e6cipue quod erat oriunda ex victrici gente, qu\u00e6 sibi partem Galli\u00e6 vendicaverat invitis Francigenis"], [785, "THE FAMILY OF LEOFWINE OF MERCIA. 737 et eorum principe\"). An opportunity is of course seized on for a special \" encomium \" on the lady herself. Deputy- wooers (\" proci\") are sent with gifts and promises ; but the prudent Emma, hearing that Cnut had children by another woman, will have nothing to say to him till he swears that none but her own children shall succeed him in the kingdom ; \" Abnegat ilia se umquam Chnutonis sponsam fieri, nisi illi jusjurando affirmaret, quod numquam alterius conjugis filium post se regnare faceret nisi ejus, si forte illi Deus ex eo filium dedisset. Dicebatur enim ab alia quadam rex filios habuisse, unde ilia suis prudenter providens, scivit ipsis sagaci animo profutura pr\u00e6ordinare.\" Quit agrees, and on these terms they marry. But, by a nearly un paralleled flight of daring (but compare the way in which Matilda is spoken of. See vol. iii. p. 655), the widow of \u00c6thelred, the mother of Eadward, \u00c6lfred, and Godgifu, is twice spoken of as a virgin ; \" Placuit ergo regi verbum virginis, et jusjurando facto virgini placuit voluntas regis.\" Presently (c. 18) we hear of the birth of Harthacnut; and we are told that Cnut kept Harthacnut with him as the heir of his throne, while his other lawful sons were sent into Normandy for education (\" alios liberates filios educandos direxerunt Normanni\u00e6, istum hunc retinentes sibi utpote futurum h\u00e6redem regni \"). Now we know that Cnut and Emma had no son except Harthacnut, and by comparing this passage with a later one (iii. 2) it is plain that the sons spoken of are Eadward and \u00c6lfred, and that the intention of the writer is to pass them off as younger sons of Cnut and Emma. A more impudent case of courtly falsehood can hardly be found; but these daring statements of her contemporary flatterer show how little Emma loved either her elder sons or the memory of their father. NOTE CCC. p. 4i4- The Family of Leofwine of Mercia. Of Leofwine himself, as far as I know, no single political action is recorded. But the important part played by his son Leofric and his children naturally awakens a certain interest in the whole family. Our curiosity as to their earlier history would be amply VOL. 1. 3 B"], [786, "APPENDIX. 738 gratified if we could put any trust in a document which is printed in the Monastioon, iii. 192, and which is drawn out in a tabular shape by Sir Francis Palgrave, English Commonwealth, ii. ccxci. This is a complete pedigree of the family, which is attached to one of the manuscripts of Florence, but which its contents show to be not earlier than the reign of John. According to this document, Leofwine was the son of Leofric, the son of \u00c6lfgar, the son of \u00c6lfgar, the son of Leofric, who is placed in the days of \u00c6thelbald of Mercia (716-757; see p. 38). Our Leofwine is made con temporary with \u00c6thelstan, Eadmund, Eadwig, and Eadgar. Now Agesilaos was the son of Archidamos, and Lewis the Twelfth was the son of the Duke of Orleans who was taken at Azincourt; still it would be amazing if a man who was not only born, but seemingly an Ealdorman, between 926 and 940 was succeeded by a son who himself lived till 1057, and whose widow, seem ingly much of his own age, survived the Norman Conquest. Leofric also himself, the famous Earl of the days of Eadward, is made to flourish and to found monasteries for a space of about eighty-two years. He is described as \" nobilis fundator multorum c\u0153nobiorum, tempore Edwardi secundi, Ethelredi, Cnutonis, Haroldi, Hardicanuti, et Edwardi tertii regum Angli\u00e6.\" Such a document is self-convicted. It is simply of a piece with the wonderful stories of Harold and Gyrth surviving to a pr\u00e6ternatural age. We shall, as usual, come nearer to the truth by turning to the charters. We find a signature of \" Leofwine dux \" in 994 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 280), from which time his signatures, if they are all those of the same person, go on through the reign of \u00c6thelred and into the reign of Cnut. From one signature in 997 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 304) he appears to have been Ealdorman of the Hwiccas (\"Wicciarum provinciarum dux\"), but as this charter is signed by two other Leofwines with the rank of thegn, it is of course possible that one of these may have been the Ealdorman of the days of Cnut. Considering the rarity of the name Northman, borne by one of Leofwine's sons, I should be inclined to look for the father of our Leofwine in a \"NorSman dux\" who signs in 994 (Cod. Dipl. iii. 280) ; only, if so, the father signs after the son. Leofwine, as I hold, succeeded Eadric in the head earldom of Mercia in 1017, and he was most likely succeeded by his son"], [787, "THE FAMILY OF LEOFWINE OF MERCIA. 739 Leofric at some time between 1024 and 1032. The last signature of Leofwine comes between 102 1 and 1024 (Cod. Dipl. iv. 29), and he was living and acting in 1023 (see Cod. Dipl. iv. 26). The first undoubted signature of Leofric as \"dux\" is in 1032 (Cod. Dipl. iv. 39). He therefore succeeded his father in some earldom at some time between those dates, and he was clearly head Earl of the Mercians in 1035 (see p. 482). The natural inference is that it was in the head earldom of the Mercians that he suc ceeded his father, and therefore that Leofwine, hitherto subordinate Ealdorman of the Hwiccas, was raised to the chief government of all Mercia when that post became vacant by the death of Eadric. Florence, under 10 17, in recording the execution of Northman, gives him the title of \"dux\" and calls him \"filius Leofwini ducis, frater scilicet Leofrici comitis.\" This distinction between \" dux\" and \" comes\" is unusual. I can only guess that it means that Leofwine aud Northman had borne the title of Ealdorman under the old state of things, while Leofric was only Eorl under the new. And that this is the ground of the distinction seems the more likely, because, in a case where the distinction was purely local, where the Chronicles in 991 call Thored Eorl and \u00c6lfric Ealdor man (see p. 279), Florence puts them together as duces. The Chronicles however do not mention Northman as an Ealdorman, but rather imply the contrary ; \" On pisuni geare w\u00e6s Eadric ealdorman ofslagen, and NorSman Leofwines sunu ealdormannes.\" Florence goes on to say that Leofric succeeded Northman in his government ; \" Leofrieum, pro Nortmanno suo germano, rex constituit ducem, et eum postmodum valde carum habuit.\" But I find no certain signature of Leofric as \"dux\" till 1032. His signature with that title is indeed put to the document in Cod. Dipl. iv. 32 which professes to belong to 1026, but of the doubtful nature of that document I have already spoken (see above, p. 667). But in 1023 (Cod. Dipl. iv. 27) he signs as \"minister\" a grant of Cnut to another man of his own name, Leofric son of Bonda; and in the last charter signed by Earl Leofwine his son seems to be pointedly distinguished from him, \" Ego Leofwine dux. Ego Leofric.\" I therefore cannot help suspecting that he did not become an Earl till his father's death, and that Florence forestalled his appointment by confounding it with the elevation of his father. If he was 3B3"], [788, "APPENDIX. 740 appointed to a subordinate earldom in 1017, it was most likely that of Chester ; at least he figures in later and spurious documents as \" Leycestri\u00e6 comes.\" Besides Northman and Leofric, Leofwine had a son named Eadwine who died in the battle of Rhyd-y-Groes (see p. 506), aud another son Godwine Godwine had a son \u00c6thelwine, who was given, probably as a child, as a hostage to Cnut, and had his hands cut off (\"a Danis obses manibus truncates est\") in the mutilation of the hostages in 1014 (see p. 371). This curious fact we learn from Heming's Worcester Cartulary, 259, 260. The relations of Cnut towards this family are singular. The father and one of his sons are high in his favour. A second son is put to death, and the son of a third son is cruelly mutilated. The difference is, I suspect, to be found in the gradual change of Cnut's own character. NOTE DDD. p. 415. The Death of Eadric. The accounts of the death of Eadric form an excellent example of the growth of a legend. Each writer knows more about it than the one immediately before him. The three elder Chronicles, under the year 1017, simply record the execution of Eadric ; \" On pisum geare w\u00e6s Eadric ealdorman ofslagen.\" The Canterbury Chronicler adds the place, London, and volun teers his own conviction that the execution was righteous ; \" Eadric ealdorman wearS ofslagan on Lundene swySe rihtlice.\" Florence adds that the execution happened at Christmas, in the palace, and that the body of Eadric was thrown over the wall of the city, and left unburied. He also tells us Cnut's motive, namely fear lest Eadric should some day betray him, as he had betrayed his former lords \u00c6thelred and Eadmund. William of Malmesbury (ii. 181) knows Eadric's fate after death; \" Putidum spiritum dimisit ad inferos.\" He has also more to tell us than his predecessors about his last sayings and doings in this world. Cnut and Eadric quarrelled, he does not know about what ; but Eadric began to go through all his services, and to tell, amongst"], [789, "THE DEATH OF EADRIC. 741 other things, how he first forsook Eadmund and then slew him for Cnut's sake. Cnut waxes wroth, and says that Eadric must die, because he has slain his own lord and Cnut's sworn brother. His blood shall be on his own head, because he has borne witness against himself that he has slain the Lord's anointed. For fear of a tumult the King has Eadric at once stifled to death (\" fauces elisus\") in the room where they were, namely Cnut's own bed-chamber, and has the body thrown through the window into the Thames. Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 756 E) makes Eadric come to Cnut directly after the murder of Eadmund aud salute him as sole King. Cnut asks the meaning of the title, which Eadric explains, saying how he has brought about Eadmund's death. Cnut answers that for so great a service he will set him higher than all the Witan of England. So he cuts off his head, and sets it on a pole on the highest tower in London. \u00c6thelred of Rievaux (X Scriptt. 365) has the same story with a few verbal changes. He sets the head on the highest gate of London. The gate and the tower may or may not be the same thing, but we have now clearly come to the beginning of the practice of exposing heads on Temple-Bar. Walter Map (De Nugis, 207), who never names Eadric, tells nearly the same story of the anonymous servant of Eadmund of whom he has so much to tell us. After Eadmund's death at Ross, the servant hastens to Cnut and tells him that he is now full King instead of half-King (\"rex integer qui semirex heri fuisti\"), and begs him to reward the man who had removed his enemy. Cnut (\" licet tristissimus, placido vultu retulit \") asks who his friend is, as he will set him high above all his comrades (\"faciam eum pr\u00e6celsum pr\u00e6 consortibus suis\"). The servant says it is himself, on which the King has him hanged on a lofty oak, a kind of death which looks as if Walter Map did not place the story in London. Roger of Wendover (i. 460) tells William of Malmesbury's story, only Idding the subject of dispute between Cnut and Eadric, which William of Malmesbury could not tell us. Eadric com plained of being deprived of his earldom of Mercia, a singular complaint, as Cnut had only that year confirmed him in it. He also tells Henry of Huntingdon's story as an alternative. Bromton (X Scriptt. 908) gives both versions with slight"], [790, "APPENDIX. 742 improvements on each. William's version is enriched by the detail that Eadric's hands and feet were tied when he was thrown out of the window. This was the mode of his death, for in this version we do not hear of his being stifled. To the other story the only addition is that, when his head was set on the gate, his body was thrown over the wall. Lastly, Knighton (X Scriptt. 2318) follows William, but gives us Eadric's speech at greater length and tells us that it was made before dinner. Also we now hear that he was thrown into the Thames from the window of a high tower ; his hands and feet were tied, and he was thrown out by a machine \u2014 a sling or catapult. These English versions seem to form a series of themselves, and to grow without foreign help. But in the Encomium Emm\u00e6 (ii. 1 5) we have a version older than any of these except perhaps that of the Chronicles, which shows how the intentional or careless perversion of a contemporary writer may depart as widely from the truth as any feat of the imagination of legend-makers. The Encomiast, as we have seen (see above, p. 711), leaves the death of Eadmund shrouded in mystery, and does not say a word impli cating Eadric ; he also leaves out Eadric's appointment to the earldom of Mercia, because his object is to represent Cnut as immediately punishing all who had dealt in any way treacherously towards Eadmund. Eadric is therefore made to demand a reward for his treachery at Assandun (\" Edricus qui a hello fugerat, quum pr\u0153mia pro hoc ipso a rege postularet, acsi hoc pro ejus victoria fecisset \"). Cnut says that he who had been faithless to one lord will not be faithful to another, and he accordingly bids Earl Eric to cut off his head with his axe. \" Hie vero nil moratus bipennem extulit, eique ictu valido caput amputavit, ut hoc exemplo discant milites regibus suis esse fideles, non infideles.\" In the English series the turning-point is when, in the version of William of Malmesbury, there comes in the first allusion to the Amalekite who slew Saul. When this parallel was once thought of, the true date of Eadric's execution, namely the thirteenth month after Eadmund's death, no longer suited the tale ; the date of the story was therefore moved back, and Eadric was made to announce the murder of Eadmund and to be put to death at once. For the details, the writers at each stage of course drew on their imaginations."], [791, "THE EXPLOITS AND MARRIAGE OF GODWINE. 743 NOTE EEE. p. 422. The Exploits and Marriage of Godwine. I copt this tale from Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 757 B) in the belief that, though its details are most likely mythical, Godwine really rose higher in Cnut's favour through some conspicuous warlike exploit during Cnut's visit to Denmark in 1019. The Biographer of Eadward (392) distinctly asserts as much, and he makes both Godwine's marriage with Gytha and his promotion to the West- Saxon earldom to be the rewards of the qualities which he showed on this journey. Cnut goes to Denmark to subdue certain rebels ; \" absent! enim rebellare paraverant collo effreni ejus abjicientes potentiam.\" This may refer either to disturbances in Denmark itself, of which we get some slight hints elsewhere (see Note GGG, and above, p. 669), or to revolts on the parts of subject nations. Godwine goes with him \u2014 \"adh\u00e6sit comes individuus per omnem viam.\" Cnut remarks Godwine's great qualities, not only his eloquence (\"quam profundus eloquio \") but his military capacity; \" Hie ejus prudentiam, hie laborum constantiam, hie virtutis mili- tiam, hie attentius expertus est idem rex tanti principis valentiam.\" He feels that such a man will be most useful to him in the government of his newly-won kingdom of England. He there- fore admits him to his most secret counsels and gives him his sister in marriage (\" ponit eum sibi a secretis, dans illi in conjugem sororem suam \"), and on his return to England he gives him the great promotion of which I have spoken in an earlier Note (see above, p. 731). If then Henry of Huntingdon's tale of Godwine's Northern exploit be historical, it must belong to this year, and it seems quite to fall in with the brief hints of the Biographer. He places it in the year 1019; \"Tertio anno regni sui ivit in Daciam, ducens exercitum Anglorum et Dacorum in Wandalos.\" He then tells the story, and adds, \" Quamobrem summo honore deinceps Anglos habuit nee minori quam Dacos.\" William of Malmesbury, however (ii. 181), transfers the story to the Swedish war of 1025, waged against Ulf and Eglaf. Cnut wins a victory mainly through the valour of Godwine and the English; \" Prompt! ssimis in ea pugna Anglis, hortante Godwino comite ut, pristin\u00e6 glori\u00e6 me mores, robur suum oculis novi domini assererent.\" No details are"], [792, "APPENDIX. 744 given; but the English by their valour wiu fame for themselves and an earldom for their captain ; \" Angli . . . victoriam consum mates comitatum duci, sibi laudem pararunt.\" Roger of Wend over (i. 466) also transfers the story to the Swedish war. He tells the tale much as it is told in Henry of Huntingdon, adding, that Godwine took Ulf and Eglaf prisoners. He says nothing about any special reward to Godwine, but of the English in general he says, \" ob hanc caussam Cnuto deinceps Anglos summo honore venerans, cum l\u00e6ta victoria ad Angliam navigavit.\" But this version is clearly wrong, for in the Swedish war of 1025 Cnut was defeated (see p. 454, and Note MMM); but William of Malmes bury's statement, that Godwine, already an Earl, received an earldom as the reward of his conduct in this war, is evidently the true version of Godwine's appointment to the West-Saxon earldom moved to a wrong year. The Biographer, as we have seen, distinctly makes Godwine's marriage as well as his promotion to be part of his reward for his exploits in 1019. He marries him to a sister of Cnut himself, but most of the other authorities make Godwine's wife Gytha to be the sister of Ulf and daughter of Thorgils Sprakaleg \u2014 the same epithet as the Homeric woo'as wkvs. So Florence (1049), Adam of Bremen (ii. 52 \u2014 \" dedit ejus Wolf sororem copulatam altero duci Guduino\"), and Snorro (Laing, ii. 252). The Knytlinga Saga also (c. 11; Johnstone, 133), as we have seen (see above, p. 725), marries Godwine to Ulf's sister, but seemingly at an earlier time. The words of Saxo (196) are not very clear ; \" Benevolentiam enim quam Canutes perfidis Ulvonis meritis denegavit, consanguine\u00e6 sibi prolis respectui tribuendam putavit. Quinetiam sororem Anglorum sa trap\u00e6 Godewino nuptiis junxit, gentem genti auimis atque affinitate conserere cupiens.\" I used to think that this meant that Cnut gave Godwine Ulf's sister, but it now strikes me that it rather means Cnut's own sister. The marriage or alleged marriao-e of Godwine with the sister of Cnut forms the subject of a leo-end which is found in more than one English writer. Its fullest form is to be found in Walter Map (207). In this version, as soon as Ead mund's servant (see above, pp. 7 1 3, 74 1) bad announced the murder of his master to Cnut and had received his fitting reward, Cnut and his Danes are guilty of all kinds of oppressions and outrages in England. Godwine, having failed to persuade Cnut to act otherwise,"], [793, "THE EXPLOITS AND MARRIAGE OF GODWINE. 745 revolts against him (\" quod Godwinus Chnuto cum multis afferens lacrimis, ad nullam exauditus est populi sui liberationem, et factus est pietate suorum impius et immitis regis Dacorum hostis, resti titque regi\u00e6 potestati viriliter, et in plurimis eum ipsi dicunt pr\u00e6valuisse congressibus, pacem semper Anglicis et libertatem exorans \"). Cnut, unable to overcome Godwine, makes a feigned reconciliation with him (\" facti sunt amici superficie tenus, et libertas Angli\u00e6 restituta \"). Cnut still goes on laying various plots against Godwine, and at last tells him that he wishes to send him into Denmark to settle things there. As his cre dentials, the King will give him a letter to his sister, who will presently call together the chief men of Denmark to receive God wine's commands. When he is going to sail, his chaplain Brand (\" consilio Brandi capellani sui, quem optimum sciebat in subti libus artificem \") \u2014 can this be meant for the Brand who was chosen Abbot of Peterborough late in 1066? (see vol. iii. p. 529; v. p. 224) \u2014 counsels him to open the letter; he does so, and finds that it contains an order for the Danes to put him to death (\" non enim sum ipso superstite rex unicus Anglorum et Daci\u00e6 \"). One expression in the alleged letter is singular (\" quod comes Godwinus . . . extorsit a me tarn dolose quam violenter Daci\u00e6 regimen per triennium\"). Godwine of course substitutes a forged letter, in which he is invested with the regency of Denmark and is pro mised the King's sister in marriage. The description which Godwine is made to give of himself is strange enough. He is \" Eboracensium comes, dominusque Lincolni\u00e6, Notingam, Leices tri\u00e6, Cestri\u00e6, Huntendun\u00e6, Northamtun\u00e6, Gloucestri\u00e6, quique nobis diu restitit Herefordi\u00e6.\" That is to say, Godwine is de scribed as Earl of exactly those parts of England of which he never was Earl; things are turned about in much the same way as they are turned about by the same writer in his account of the division of the kingdom between Cnut and Eadmund (see above, p. 706). Yet the imaginary warfare of Godwine after the death of Eadmund may well be a confused remembrance of real warfare before the death of Eadmund, and one would like to know something about the alleged resistance of Hereford to Cnut, a point on which Walter Map might certainly preserve a genuine tradition. The story here breaks off; but in the romantic Life of Harold (Chro niques Anglo-Normandes, 153, *54) the tale goes on to its natural"], [794, "APPENDIX. 746 end. The letter is opened, and another is put in its place, by which the Danes are ordered to receive Godwine as regent, and to give him the King's sister in marriage. All this is accordingly done, and Cnut then puts the best face upon the matter; he receives Godwine as a brother and gives him the rank of \" consul \" or Earl. The same story is alluded to in the Chronicle of Ralph the Black (160), who in his account of Godwine (see above, p. 725) tells us how \"in Daciam cum breve regis transmissus callide duxit sororem Cnutonis.\" The same story is told by Saxo (194) of the way in which Ulf obtained his own wife Estrith. We can further compare the stories of Bellerophontes, Uriah\u2014 an analogy which does not fail to present itself to the mind of Harold's biogra pher \u2014 the messenger of Pausanias in Thucydides (i. 132), and the letter given by King Philip of Swabia to Otto of Wittelsbach, Chronicon Slavorum, vii. 14. In weighing these counter-statements, there is no doubt that, for anything personal to Godwine, the Biographer's authority is the highest of any. But his authority will hardly bear up against so many opposite witnesses, especially against the distinct, though implied, statement of Florence (1049). Earl Swegen is there described as \" Godwini comitis et Gyth\u00e6 filius,\" and directly after wards we read of \" Beorn comes, filius avunculi sui Danici comitis Ulfi ... ac frater Suani Danorum regis.\" Florence himself indeed goes wrong when in a later passage (1067, and again in the Genealogia, vol. i. p. 275) he calls Gytha \"soror Suani regis Danorum ; \" but this is a slip between Swegen Estrithson's aunt and his sister, and in no way brings Gytha nearer to Cnut. If Gytha had really been Cnut's sister, it is inconceivable that any one would have turned her, especially in the elaborate and formal way in which it is done by Florence and Adam, into a sister of Ulf. But a sister of the King's brother-in-law might be much more easily mistaken for the King's own sister ; perhaps she might be laxly called so. But in any case I accept the statements as to the parentage of Godwine's wife as alternative statements, and I do not admit that Godwine married twice. It seems to me that, when Ulf's sister had been mistaken for Cnut's sister, and when two statements had thus arisen about her, the next stage was to cut her into two separate women. Thus William of Malmesbury (ii. 200) marries Godwine, first to a sister of Cnut, who bears one nameless"], [795, "WYRTGEORN KING OF THE WENDS. 747 son, and then to a nameless woman, who was the mother of his historical children. This is clearly an attempt to reconcile the statement that Godwine married Cnut's sister with the fact that Godwine's children are never spoken of as in any way of kin to Cnut. William's account of Godwine's first wife is an excellent speci men of Norman calumny. She gets great wealth by selling English slaves, especially beautiful girls, into Denmark. Her son, while still a boy, is drowned in the Thames, being carried into the stream by a horse given him by his grandfather \u2014 Swegen, Wulfnoth, or whom 1 \u2014 and she herself is killed by lightning for her misdeeds. Mr. Thorpe (Diplomatarium, 312) seemingly accepts this tale, as he takes the marriage settlement of a certain Godwine (Cod. Dipl. iv. 10), containing the names of three other Godwines, all alike unknown, to be a record of the imaginary second marriage of the great Earl. Bromton (934) and Knighton (2333) tell William's story with improvements, making, with a fine perception of dates and ages, Godwine's first wife to be a daughter of Cnut by \u00c6lfgifu of Northampton. See above, p. 734. I have no doubt that Godwine had but one wife, Gytha, daughter of Thorgils, sister of Ulf, and aunt of Swegen Estrithson, and that all his sons and daughters were her children. NOTE FFF. p. 430. Wtrtgeorn King of the Wends. I cannot pretend to any special knowledge of Slavonic history, and I must confess that I am quite unable to identify this King Wyrtgeorn. There was however a very eminent Slavonic prince at this time, who was closely connected with Cnut, aud who spent some time with him in England. I do not know whether the two can anyhow be the same, or whether there has been any confusion between them. The person I mean is Godescalc the son of Uto or Pribignew the Obotrite, a Wendish prince whose exploits will be found recorded in the Chronica Sclavica, ap.

In his youth he was sent as a student to Liineburg, but, hearing of his father's death at the hands of the neighbouring Saxons, he gave over his studies, renounced his faith, put himself at the head of his heathen countrymen, and carried on a fierce war with the Saxons of Holstein and Stormaria. The freemen of Thetmarsen alone with stood him. He was then brought to a better mind by a rebuke received from a Christian, which has a somewhat legendary sound. He was soon afterwards taken prisoner by Bernhard the Second, Duke of the Saxons (1010-1062), who after a while released him, seemingly on condition that he should leave the country. He then joined himself to Cnut, entered his service, seemingly as an officer of the Housecarls, served in his wars, and, according to the national Chronicle, was rewarded with the hand of his daughter \u2014 no doubt a mistake for sister \u2014 whose name is given as Demmyn. He was in England at the time of Cnut's death. According to the Chro nicle he then returned to his own country (\"revertens ad patriam post mortem Kanuti,\" c. 13), but according to Adam of Bremen (ii. 75) it was not till early in the reign of Eadward (\"post mortem Chnut regis et filiorum ejus rediens ab Anglia\"). In this case it is not unlikely (see vol. ii. p. 65) that he was banished from England. According to Saxo (20) he served some time under Swegen Estrith son in his war with Magnus, and married his natural daughter Siritha (Sigrid ?). The two Swegens are clearly confounded, and Godescalc is much more likely to have married a daughter of the elder Swegen. But his main object was to win back his own inheritance, which after some fighting he regained, and devoted himself to the spread of Christianity among his countrymen. He not only built and endowed churches, but became personally a missionary, translating into the vulgar tongue what the clergy preached in Latin or German. He waged some wars in concert with Duke Bernhard, and his power seems to have been sensibly lessened after that prince's death. At last, in 1066, he suffered martyrdom at the hands of his heathen subjects, at the instigation of his brother-in-law Blusso. With him suffered John, Bishop of Mecklenburg, who was sacrificed to the Slavonic god Radegast, and others of his companions, both clergy and laity. Godescalc's wife, the Danish princess, was sent away naked ; several of his sons were killed, but one, Henry, took refuge with his cousin Swegen in Denmark, and afterwards avenged his father's death. On the"], [797, "THE DEATH OF ULF. 749 death of Godescalc, the whole Wendish country fell back into heathenism. The account of these things in the honest Nether-Dutch of Botho's Picture Chronicle of Brunswick (Leibnitz, iii. 327) is worth reading. \"In dussem sulven jare [1065, but the year of William's coming to England] vorhoff sick ein grot mort van den Wenden, Gotsehalckus wart dot geslagen binnen Lentzin, Answerus wart mit sinen moneken geschent binnen Rosseborge, bischopp Johannes to Mekelenborch de wart mit speten to hauwen in alle stucke, unde worpen sinen licham upp de strate in de goten, unde offerden sin hovet orem affgode Ridegaste.

But I do not know how far we are justified in making him the same as the Wyrtgeorn of Florence. There is also a single charter of 1026 (Cod. Dipl. iv. 33) which is signed (along with the Earls Godwine, Hakon, Hrani, and Sihtric) by an Earl Wrytesleof, whose name certainly has a very Slavonic sound. NOTE GGG. p. 431. The Death of Ulf. Ulf, as we have seen, plays hardly any part in English history ; there seems no doubt that he was put to death by order of Cnut, but the Danish and Norwegian accounts of his death differ very widely. According to Snorro's Saga of Saint Olaf (Laing, ii. 244), Ulf had joined with Emma in a conspiracy to set Harthacnut on the throne of Denmark, of which kingdom Ulf had been left in command, as well as in charge of the kingly bairn. Cnut comes over into Denmark, and Ulf, finding himself forsaken of all men, asks for grace. This is just at the time of the joint Swedish and Norwegian invasion which led to the battle of the Helga. Cnut"], [798, "APPENDIX. 750 bids Ulf come with his men and ships, and they will talk of grace afterwards. Ulf joins the King's muster and takes a part in the battle. Soon after, on Saint Michael's Eve (252), Ulf entertains Cnut at Roskild. The Earl was in a good humour, and the King in a bad one. They quarrel over a game of chess, on which Ulf rises to leave the room. Cnut says, \" Run away, Ulf the Fearful.\" Ulf turns round and reminds him that he did not call him Ulf the Fearful when he himself ran away at the Helga and Ulf saved him. The next morning, as he is dressing, Cnut bids his page go and kill Ulf. The lad comes back, saying that he has not killed him because he has gone to the church of Saint Lucius. Cnut then bids his chamberlain Ivar the White go and kill him in the church, which was accordingly done, after which Cnut gives great wealth to the church of Roskild. Saxo has quite another story. Ulf first (194) obtains Estrith in marriage by the stratagem which I have already mentioned. He then makes divers plots, takes refuge in Sweden, exhorts Olaf and Omund to an invasion of Denmark, and fights on their side at the Helga (195)- Presently, on the birth of her son Swegen, Estrith obtains her husband's pardon from her brother (196). Then in a feast at Roskild, seemingly at Christmas (\" annuo feriarum circuitu repetito \"), Ulf, being half drunk, something like Kleitos in the history of Alexander, enlarges on his own exploits, especially his exploits at the Helga against Cnut. He is therefore at once put to death, quite justly, according to Saxo's declared opinion, though his language is so laboured that one might fancy that he had some doubts about it. He comments thus (197) ; \"Igitur Ulvo inter ipsa mens\u00e6 sacra ab adstantibus interfici jussus, pr\u00e6cipitis lingu\u00e6 justa supplicia pependit. Ita dum aliena facta parum sobrie meminit, sua ceeinit, siccatosque cupide calices proprii sanguinis liquore complevit. Merito enim ex tarn petulanti ingenio amaritudinem potius quam voluptatem percipere debuit, quod glori\u00e6 sibi loco arrogasset, ductu suo pr\u00e6cipuis regis viribus ultimam incessisse jacturam.\" Cnut then gives his sister two provinces as a sort of wergild for her husband. She presently gives them, or a tithe of them, to the church of Roskild ; \" Quas eadem postmodum sacrosanct\u00e6 Trini tatis \u00e6di, pr\u00e6cipua apud Roskildiam veneratione cult\u00e6, decimarum nomine partiendas curavit.\" See p. 472."], [799, "THE PILGRIMAGE OF CNUT. 751 ,. These stories, different as they are, have manifestly some elements in common. I do not pretend to decide between them. On Ulf's presence at the Helga, see Note MMM. NOTE HHH. p. 434. The Pilgrimage of Cnut. The disputed date of Cnut's journey to Rome is discussed by Lappenberg (476, ii. 211 Thorpe). The Chronicles place it in 1031. So does Florence, who adds that he went from Denmark, and describes his alms and his redemption of the tolls by which pilgrims were troubled at various points of the road. He also mentions his vow of amendment before the tomb of the Apostles, and gives a copy of the letter, which he says was sent to England by Lyfing, then Abbot of Tavistock, afterwards the famous Bishop, who had gone with him on his journey. Cnut himself went from Rome to Denmark, and thence to England. In the heading of the letter, Cnut describes himself as \" Rex totius Angli\u00e6, et Dene marci\u00e6, et Norreganorum, et partis Suanorum.\" The account given by William of Malmesbury is essentially the same, with some abridgements and verbal differences. The description of Cnut as King of the Norwegians seems to point to a time later than his conquest of Norway in 1027. The Encomiast (ii. 20) enlarges with much rhetoric on Cnut's piety, and says that he himself saw him on his journey in the church of Saint Bertin at Saint Omer's, where he was much edified by the King's prayers and almsdeeds. He gives no date, but he seems to imply (19) that it was after Cnut had gained a right to be called Emperor of five kingdoms (see Note NNN). But with so rhetorical a writer, this can hardly be taken as a distinct chronological statement, and it is certain that the complete submission of Scotland, which, as well as Norway, is reckoned among the five, did not happen till after Cnut's return from Rome (see p. 450). Adam of Bremen (ii. 60-65) seems to put the pilgrimage in the time of Archbishop Libentius, that is, between 1029 and 1032 ; but I am not clear that its mention at this point is more than incidental, and, at all events, the chronology is confused, as Adam places the pilgrimage after the marriage of"], [800, "APPENDIX. 752 Henry and Gunhild, which did not take place till after Cnut's death (see p. 455, and Note NNN). His description is very odd; \"Tempore illo Conradus Imperator filiam Chnut regis Heinrico filio accepit in matrimouium. Cum quibus statim regio fastu Italiam ingressus est ad faciendam regno justitiam, comitem habens itineris Chnut regem, potentia trium regnorum barbaris gentibus valde terribilem.\" Cnut himself, in the letter, mentions his deal ings with the Pope, the Emperor, and King Rudolf of Burgundy, by which English and Danish travellers, whether pilgrims or merchants, were released from various tolls and exactions, and English Archbishops from the great sums that they had to pay for the pallium. This was at a great meeting at Easter (\"quia magna congregatio nobilium in ipsa paschali solemnitate ibi cum domino papa Johanne et Imperatore Cuonrado erat\"), at which the concessions made to Cnut were witnessed by four Archbishops, twenty Bishops, and a countless multitude of Dukes and nobles. This leads us to the account of Wipo (Vita Chuonradi, 16), from which it appears that this great gathering was for no less a purpose than the Emperor's coronation, at which he distinctly says that Cnut and Rudolf were present. He describes the Emperor's election and coronation, and adds, \" His ita peractis in duorum regum pr\u00e6sentia, Ruodolfi regis Burgundi\u00e6 et Chnutonis regis Anglorum, divino officio finito, Imperator duorum regum medius ad cubiculum suum honorifice ductus est.\" But there is no doubt that the coronation of Conrad happened at the Easter not of 103 1, but of 1027. The Tours Chronicle, in Bouquet, x. 284, places the journey \" anno Conradi 11. et Roberti Regis xxx.\" The thirtieth year of Robert, counting from his father's death in 996, would be 1026 or 1027. The second year of Conrad means, oddly enough, neither the second year of his German reign, which would be 1025 (see Wipo, c. 2), nor that of his Imperial reign, which would be 1028, but the second year of his Italian reign, which would be 1027, as he was crowned at Milan in 1026. See Arnulf, Hist. Med. ii. 2, ap. Muratori, iv. 14 ; Sigonius de Regno Itali\u00e6, 354 ; and cf. Wipo, capp. n, 12. But the Aquitanian William Godell, who gives the account in nearly the same words as the Tours Chronicle, places it \" anno Domini mxxx. et regni sui [Cnutonis] anno xv.\" They go on to say, \" Fortissimus rex Cnuto Romam perrexit, in"], [801, "THE LAWS OF CNUT. 753 eoque itinere tanta munificentia usus est, quanta nullus unquani regum usus fuisse reminiscitur. Ecclesiis enim, pauperibus et infirmantibus et carceratis multa largitus est.

We must therefore accept the date of 1027, and suppose with Lappenberg that the Chroniclers were misled by mistaking a date of mxxvi. for mxxxi., and that the titles in Florence and William of Malmesbury are simply a careless insertion of Florence himself or of some one from whom he copied the letter. It is worth noticing that though the kingdom of Burgundy was now in its last days, Cnut speaks of Rudolf as a prince of import ance through his command of the passes of the Alps ; \" Rodulphus rex, qui maxime ipsarum clausurarani dominate!-.\" NOTE III. p. 434- The Laws of Cnut. Cnut's code will be found in Thorpe's Laws and Institutes (i 358) and in Schmid's Gesetze der Angelsachsen (250). The exact date is uncertain. The heading itself tells us only that the laws were enacted by the authority of the Witan (\"mid his witena gepeahte,\" \"venerando ejus sapientum consilio\") m a midwinter Gemot at Winchester. Kemble (ii. 259) refers them to some Gemot between 1016 and 1020. Lappenberg (467, \"\u25a0 202 Thorpe) argues, from the fact that Cnut in the heading calls himself King of the Norwegians, and also from the mention of Peter's pence (e. 9- about \"Romfeoh.\" Cf. in the letter \"denarii quos Rom\u00e6 ad sanctum Petrum debemus\"), that they must be later than the pilgrimage to Rome and the conquest of Norway, VOL. I. 3 c"], [802, "APPENDIX. 754 that is later than 1028. Schmid in his Preface (lv.), on the ground that Cnut never uses his Danish or Norwegian titles in his English charters, looks on them as an interpolation here. The Norwegian title is absent in one manuscript, and Schmid also quotes a text which contains the words, \" And p\u00e6t was gewordon sona swa Cnut cyngc, mid his witena gepeaht, friS and freondscipe betweox Denum and Englum fullice gef\u00e6stnode and heora \u00e6rran saca getw\u00e6mde.\" He therefore holds that the midwinter Gemot spoken of in the heading was one which immediately followed the Oxford Gemot of 1018 (see p. 419). I follow Lappenberg in placing the laws late in Cnut's reign, because they seem to me to breathe the spirit of that part of his life, the same spirit which we find expressed in the Roman letter. It strikes me that the scribe quoted by Schmid confounded these laws with the renewal of Eadgar's Law, from which they are evidently distinct. The hunting code to which I have referred in p. 436 seems to me to carry its own confutation with it. What can be made of such a division of society as we find there? (Thorpe, i. 426; Schmid, 318). First we hear (c. 2) of \" mediocres homines, quos Angli 'les pegeues' (or 'l\u00e6s-pegnas,' see Schmid's note) nuneupant, Dani vero 'yoongmen vocant;'\" then (c. 3) of \" liberales quos Dani (sic) 'ealdermen' appellant;\" then (c. 4) of \"minuti homines quos 'tineman' Angli dicunt;\" lastly (c. 12) of \" liberalis homo, i. e. pegen.\" Schmid (lvi.) seems by no means clear of its genuine ness. Kemble however (ii. 80) seems to have no doubt, and he conjectures that the clause (c. 30) in which the right of every freeman to hunt on his own ground is asserted as strongly as it is in the undoubted laws was forced upon Cnut by the Witan. This is going rather far in the way of conjecture. After reading Cnut's laws, and comparing them with the testimonies already quoted from Florence and William of Malmes bury (see p. 437, cf. 441), the following declamation of John of Wallingford (Gale, 549) seems strange indeed ; \" Successitque ei [Eadmundo] ex pr\u00e6dict\u00e6 concordi\u00e6 conditione Cnuto Danus et hostis potius Anglorum quam regriator, immutavitque statim statuta et leges scriptas patri\u00e6, et consuetudines, et populum, qui sub omni honore et libertate tempore suorum regum exstiterat, sub gravi jugo coegit, nihilque de \u00c6lfredi boni regis et justi, qui ab undique bonas consuetudines collegerat et scripserat, audire"], [803, "THE HOUSECARLS. 755 noluit statutis.

Sicque factum, ut pr\u00e6dia et possessiones et antiqua pr\u00e6clarorum virorum tenementa su\u00e6 adscriberet ditioni. Porro quot et quanta sub pallio ejus protectionis facta fuerint injusta, non est seriptura qu\u00e6 possit explicare.\" NOTE KKK. p. 444. The Housecarls. There is no distinct mention in the Chronicles of the institution of the Thingmen or Housecarls, nor does their name occur in any of the English Laws, but the incidental mention of them by the name of Housecarls, or by the equivalent name of Hiredmen (familiares, members of the hired, court or family), is common in the Chronicles, while grants to housecarls and signatures of housecarls are common in the Charters, and they are mentioned several times in Domesday. The subject is discussed by Lap penberg (467,1. 202 Thorpe), and by Kemble (ii. 118, 124), to whom I owe the remark that the institution was only a revival of the comitatus. The \" Leges Castrenses \" or \" Witherlags Ret \" are described at length by Saxo (p. 197), and they are drawn out in a tabular form in a separate work by Swegen Aggesson (ap. Langebek, iii. 141). A Danish text follows at p. 159. This however dates only from the reign of Cnut the Sixth, who reigned from n85toi202. In the Chronicle of King Eric (Langebek, i. 159) they are, by a somewhat grotesque mistake, attributed, with several other actions of the great Cnut, to his son Harthacnut. It is not easy to make out from the confused narrative of Saxo when he conceived the force to have been established. According to Swegen (146), the laws were enacted in England after the settlement of the country (\" quum in Anglia, omni exercitu suo collecto, Kanutus rex defessa bellicis operibus membra quietis tranquillitate recrearet\") by the advice of Opo, a Dane from Zealand, who is also mentioned by Saxo (197), and his son Eskill. I think that there is little doubt that the date which I have suggested in the text must be the right one. Lappenberg also 3ca"], [804, "APPENDIX. 756 places the enactment of the \" Witherlags Ret\" early in Cnut's reign. The force was made up of men of all nations. So says Swegen (145) ; \"Tanti regis exercitus, utpote ex variis collectus nationibus, universis videlicet regnis ditioni su\u00e6 subjugatis.\" It is clear then that, among Cnut's other subjects, Englishmen might find their way into the force. So Saxo, 197; \"Quos quum rex natione, linguis, ingeniis, quam maxime dissidentes animadverteret.\" Saxo (196) fixes the number at six thousand ; he calls them \" clientelam suam sex millium numerum explentem.\" (\" Clientela,\" as used by Saxo, is a technical word, and quite recalls the old comitatus.) But Swegen (144) reckons them only at three thousand; \" Cujus summa, tria ruillia militum selectorum explevit. Quam catervam suo idiomate thinglith nuncupari placuit.\" I know of no state ment as to their numbers in later times, but the force was one which was likely to grow. The \" stippendiarii et mercenarii\" formed the core of the English army at Senlac, and we find Earls keeping housecarls as well as Kings. That Cnut did lay down strict laws for the government of the force there is no reason to doubt ; but I confess that in the Leges Castrenses, as we have them, there is much that has a mythical sound. Traitors for instance (Saxo, 199; Swegen, iii. 162) were expelled and declared to be \" Nithing.\" They had the choice of departing by land or by sea. He who chose the sea was put alone into a boat, with oars, food, &c. ; but if any chance brought him to shore, he was put to death. This sounds to me very much of a piece with various mythical and romantic tales about people being exposed in boats, of which that of the \u00c6theling Eadwine in the reign of \u00c6thelstan is the most famous (see above, p. 689). Then again, though no doubt, in Cnut's army as in other armies, purely military offences would be judged by purely military tribunals, I confess to stumbling at one passage in the Witherlags Ret (Swegen, iii. 149), which sets before us the military assembly as judging among its own members even in causes of real property; \" Constitutione etiam generali cautum est, ut omnis inter commilitones orta contro versia de fundis pr\u00e6diis, et agris, vel etiam de mansionis depr\u00e6 datione ... in jam dicto colloquio agitaretur. Turn vero is, cui commilitonum judicium jus venditionis adjudicabit, cum sex"], [805, "THE HOUSECARLS. 757 sortitis in suo coetu, . . . territorii sui continuatam possessionem sibi vendicare debet, pr\u00e6scriptionemque lege assignata tuebitur.\" If Cnut's courts martial really exercised this kind of jurisdiction, it was a clear violation of the constitutional rights of Ealdormen, Bishops, earls, churls, eveiybody ; still it need not have interfered with the personal rights of any but members of the guild. I confess however that I should like some better evidence of the fact. It is also rather too great a demand on our faith when we are told that these laws never were broken (save in one famous case) till the reign of Nicolas of Denmark (1101-1130), and when the authority cited for the statement is Bo or Boethius the Wend, an old soldier of Cnut who shared the longevity of the legendary Harold and Gyrth, and was alive in the time of Nicolas (Swegen, iii. 154, 163). The one offender in earlier times was Cnut himself, who in a fit of passion killed one of his comrades. The assembly was perplexed as to the way of dealing with such a culprit, and the King settled the matter by adjudging himself to a ninefold wergild. Saxo, pp. 199, 200. So Swegen, somewhat differently, iii. 151. There are strict regulations (see Swegen, iii. 147) about the horses of the Thingmen ; but these were of course only horses on which they rode to battle (see p. 271), not horses to be used in actual fight. As for the behaviour of the housecarls to the mass of the people and the feeling with which they were looked at by the mass of the people, we can say very little in the absence of any direct evidence. They were a standing army in days when a standing army was a new thing, and a standing army, as long as it is a new thing, is never a popular institution. And the housecarls at first were not only a standing army, but a standing army largely made up of foreigners and conquerors. Still every thing both in the reign of Cnut and in the reign of Eadward would tend to make the force grow more and more national and popular. The time when it was likely to be abused, as we know that it was abused, was in the days of Cnut's sons. Still, even under Harold the son of Godwine, we can perhaps discern a certain tinge of ill-will in the words \" stippendiarii\" and \" mercenarii,\" which seem to breathe the same spirit as the manifest dislike to Danegelds and heregelds, perhaps one might say to taxes of every"], [806, "APPENDIX. 758 kind. But I see no sign of any strong ill-will between the housecarls and the people at any time. I can find no evidence for the highly-coloured picture given by Mr. St. John (ii. 99) of their insolence in Cnut's days, though it is likely enough that such things sometimes happened. But the reference which he gives to the Ramsey History (c. lxxxv. p. 441) is only a legend about Bishop \u00c6thelric making a Danish thegn \u2014 married, by the way, to an Englishwoman \u2014 drunk, and so getting a grant of lands out of him. As for Bromton's tales about Englishmen having to stand on bridges while the Danes passed, having to bow to the Danes, and the like (X Scriptt. 934), they prove very little indeed. They are parts of an historical confusion which I shall presently have to mention, and they seem to be placed in the time of Cnut's sons rather than in that of Cnut himself. One point more remains with regard to the relations of the housecarls to the people at large. Though there is no mention of the force in the genuine English laws, yet in the so-called Laws of Eadward the Confessor (Thorpe, i. 449) and in Bracton (iii. 15. 2, 3) the legal process of \"Murdrum,\" and in Bracton the Pre sentment of Englishry also, is traced up to the institutions of Cnut. When Cnut, we are told, sent away the mass of his Danish troops, at the request of the Witan (\" rogatu baronum Anglorum,\" \" precatu baronum de terra \"), the Witan pledged themselves that the rest should be safe in life and limb (\" firmam pacem haberent\"), and that any Englishman who killed any of them should suffer punishment. If the murderer could not be discovered, the town ship or hundred was fined. Out of this, we are told by Bracton, grew the doctrine, continued under the Norman Kings, that an unknown corpse was presumed to be that of a Frenchman \u2014 in Cnut's time, doubtless, that of a Dane \u2014 and that the \" Englishry \" of a slain person had to be proved. The \"Laws of Eadward\" of course contain no notice of \" Englishry \" as opposed to Frenchry \u2014 if I may coin such a word ; but neither do they mention it as opposed to Danishry. They simply record the promise of the Witan \u2014 not an unreasonable one \u2014 that Cnut's soldiers should be under the protection of the law. This is likely enough ; any thing more is the mere carrying back of Norman institutions into earlier times. In the Dialogus de Scaccario (i. 10) there is"], [807, "CNUT'S RELATIONS WITH SCOTLAND. 759 no hint of the \"Murdrum\" and \"Englishry\" being older than the Norman Conquest. See vol. v. pp. 443, 44^. We shall as we go on come across many passages in which the housecarls both of the King and of the great Earls are spoken of. Among the charters of Eadward are several (Cod. Dipl. iv. 201, 204, 221, cf. 200) containing grants to the King's housecarls. The three grantees spoken of are called Thurstan, Urk, and Wulfnoth \u2014 the last at all events being an Englishman, per haps a kinsman of Godwine. The two latter writs are addressed to Earl Harold. In the oldest (201), a Middlesex writ, addressed to Bishop Robert, Osgod Clapa, and Ulf the Sheriff, Thurstan is described in the English copy as \" Durstan min huskarll,\" in the Latin as \" pr\u00e6fectus meus palatinus Durstanus.\" As Mr. Kemble says (ii. 123), such a description could not apply to every man in so large a body ; so we may infer that Thurstan stood high in the service. There is also the will of Wulfwig, Bishop of Dorchester (Cod. Dipl. iv. 290), which is witnessed by a crowd of people, great and small, from the King and the Lady downwards, including some signatures of large bodies of men ; \" On eallra S\u00e6s kynges hiiscarlan and on his m\u00e6sse-preostan .... and on eallra Sara burhwara gewitnesse on Lincolne and on eallra S\u00e6ra manna Se seceaS gearmorkett to Stowe.\" This immediately follows on the signatures of the Stallers Ansgar, Ralph, and Lyfing, from which Mr. Kemble (ii. 122) infers that the Stallers were the special commanders of the force. Housecarls are also mentioned several times in Domesday (see Ellis, i. 91 ; ii. 151 ; Kelham, 238), and in Simeon of Durham (Gest. Regg. 1071 ; see vol. iv. pp. 304, 513) we find a housecarl not only reckoned among the \" principales viri \" of Northumberland, but high in personal favour with William; \" Eilaf huscarl apud regem pr\u00e6pollens honore.\" NOTE LLL. p. 448. Cnut's Relations with Scotland. I. The authorities for the Battle of Carham are the Melrose Chronicle (in anno), and two entries of Simeon of Durham, one in his general History (Gest. Regg. in anno), the other in his"], [808, "760 APPENDIX. History of the Church of Durham (iii. 5; ap. X Scriptt. 30). The Melrose writer (p. 155) simply says, \" Ingens bellum inter Anglos et Scottos apud Carham geritur.\" This entry seems an abridgement of that iii Simeon's Annals ; \" Ingens bellum apud Carrum gestum est inter Scottos et Anglos, inter Huctredum filium Waldef comitem Northymbrorum, et Malcolmum filium Cyneth regem Scottorum, cum quo suit in bello Eugenius Calvus rex Lutinensium.\" From neither of these accounts should we learn which side was victorious. But in the Durham History Simeon becomes explicit, if not exaggerated ; \" Universus a flumine Tesa usque Twedam populus, dum contra infinitam Scottorum multitudinem apud Carrum dimicaret, pene totus cum natu majoribus suis interiit.\" In the Durham Annals (Pertz, xviii. 507) there is a further notice; \" Fuit apud Carrum illud famosum bellum inter Northanhymbros et Scottos, ubi pene totus sancti Cuthberti populos interiit, inter quos etiam xviii sacerdotes, qui inconsulte se intermiscuerant bello ; quo audito pr\u00e6scriptus episcopus dolorem et vitam morte finivit.\" It is not clear whether this is the event referred to by Fordun (iv. 40), where he tells us that Duncan was sent by Malcolm to meet the Danes and Northumbrians (\"qui tune velut una gens coierant\"), who were on their march to ravage Cumberland. He met them and defeated them with great slaughter. Fordun seems to place this before the death of \u00c6thelred ; in so confused a writer the chronological difficulty is of no great consequence ; it is of more importance that a Northumbrian army, marching to invade any part of Cumberland, would hardly pass by Carham. There are several points to be noticed here. First, the event of 1018, like the event of 1066, was ushered in by a comet which, though it is not mentioned by our national Chroniclers, seems to have deeply affected local imaginations. \" Northanimbrorum populis,\" says Simeon in his local work, \" per xxx. noctes cometa apparuit, qu\u00e6 terribili pr\u00e6sagio futuram provinci\u00e6 cladem pr\u00e6 monstravit. Siquidem paullo post, id est post triginta dies,\" &c. Then follows the account of the battle. Secondly, Simeon, accurate as he commonly is, has gone wrong \u2014 who could feel certain of not going wrong? \u2014 among the Earls of his own land. His Uhtred ought (see above, p. 587) to be Eadwulf. It was he, \"ignavus valde et timidus,\" who now,"], [809, "CNUT'S RELATIONS WITH SCOTLAND. 761 according to one view (see above, p. 585), ceded Lothian to the victorious Malcolm. Thirdly, for \" Lutinensium\" in Simeon we should, according to Mr. Robertson (i. 99), read \" Clutinensium.\" Fourthly, the extent of the district from which the English army came should be noticed. It came from the land between Tees and Tweed, that is from old Bernicia, without Lothian. This suggests the question why Lothian, if it was not ceded for the first time till after the battle, did not take a part in the war as well as the rest of the earldom. Fifthly, the \" natu majores \" of Simeon are doubtless the \" yld estan\" of our English Chronicles. See p. 591, and below, p. 777. On this slaughter of the nobility, compare the same result at Assan dun, p. 392. II. With regard to Cnut's later relations with Scotland, our own Chronicles contain no entries on Scottish affairs earlier than the great submission of 1031. So far as the sagas can be relied upon, they certainly represent Cnut as exercising lordship in Scot land at an earlier time. In Snorro's Saga of Olaf Haraldsson (Laing, ii. 195) we read how Cnut \"reigned over Denmark and England and had conquered for himself a great part of Scotland.\" And again we read (Laing, ii. 196; Johnstone, 148), both in prose and verse, how two Kings came to Cnut from Scotland out of Fife, and how he received them to favour, restored their lands, and gave them fresh gifts (\" til hans komo tveir konungar nordan as Skot landi, as Fifi, oc gas hann peim upp reidi sina, oc lond pau oil, er peir hofdo adr att, oc J?ar med storar vingiafir \"). This is placed while Cnut is still only intriguing, and not yet fighting, against Olaf, that is, at some time before the battle of the Helga in 1025. This story may be merely a transfer to a wrong date of the submission of 1031, or it may be a record of some earlier sub mission. If the sagas are extremely confused in their chronology, our Chronicles are during this reign extremely meagre in their entries. The Knytlinga Saga also (c. 17; Johnstone, 144) not only makes Cnut subdue a large part of Scotland, but sets his son Harold over it as Under-king, as Swegen was in Norway and Harthacnut in Denmark (see below, p. 775)- This seems to be put before the Roman pilgrimage, but the chronology is very con fused. The Roman pilgrimage seems to be put after the conquest"], [810, "762 APPENDIX. of Norway. And of a reign of Harold in Scotland nothing, as far as I know, is mentioned elsewhere. There is also the account in Fordun (iv. 41) of Cnut's relations with Cumberland, to which I have referred in the text (see p. 449). This story may be true in itself; but the prominence which is given to it certainly looks like an attempt to evade the fact of the submission of Scotland itself. Fordun places the Cumbrian expe dition after the Roman pilgrimage, and that he places (iv. 40) in the eighth year of Conrad, meaning seemingly 1032. The refusal of Duncan to do homage is thus described ; \" Non enim haotenus Anglorum regi Cnutoni, quia regnum invaserat, pro Cumbria Duncanus, quamquam iterum et iterum ab eo submonitus, homa gium fecerat, quia non inde sibi de jure, sed regibus Angligenis fidem deberi rex rescripsit.\" Cnut then marches against him ; that it was with the intention of incorporating Cumberland with the English kingdom, of dealing with the dominions of the recusant as being, in feudal language, a forfeited fief, I infer from the words \" Cumbriam suo subdendam dominio pedeteutim advenit.\" The terms on which peace was finally made are thus described ; \" Ut regis [Scottorum sc] nepos Duncanus Cumbri\u00e6 dominio libere, sicut predecessorum aliquis liberius tenuit, de cetero gaudeat in futurum, dum tamen ipse futurorumque regum h\u00e6redes qui pro tempore fuerint regi Cnutoni ceterisque suis successoribus Anglo rum regibus fidem consuetam faciant.\" There is nothing unlikely in all this, except perhaps in the extreme loyalty towards the house of Cerdic which is attributed to the Cumbrian Under-king ; but we must always remember the strong tendency of Scottish writers to make too much rather than too little of the vassalage of Cumber land to England. III. We now come to the undoubted submission of Scotland to Cnut in 103 1, as recorded in our own Chronicles. I do not under stand Mr. Burton (i. 368), when, after quoting Mr. Thorpe's trans lation (ii. 128), which is certainly made up confusedly from the Worcester and Peterborough Chronicles, he says that \" in only one of the four accepted versions of the original is there anything resembling this.\" The Abingdon Chronicle is certainly silent, but Worcester and Peterborough both record the submission, though in different words, and Canterbury follows Peterborough. The Wor cester entry runs thus ; \" pa for he [Cnut] to Scotlande, and Scotta"], [811, "CNUT'S RELATIONS WITH SCOTLAND. 763 cyng eode him on hand and wearS his mann ; ac he p\u00e6t lytle hwile heold.\" Peterborough says, \"he [Cnut] for to Scotlande, and Scotta cyng him to beah M\u00e6lcolm, and twegen oSre cyningas, M\u00e6lb\u00e6jje and Iehmarc.\" Mr. Robertson (i. 97, ii. 400) seems unable to identify Jehmarc. Mr. Skene (Celtic Scotland, i. 397) makes him the same as Imergi, from whom Somerled, who was killed in 1166, was fourth in descent, and places him in Airer gaidhel or Argyll, the old Scottish land of Dalriada. His com panion, \" M\u00e6lb\u00e6pa,\" \" Mealb\u00e6aSe,\" must be the same as the \"MacbeoSe\" of the Worcester Chronicle in 1054, that is the Machab\u00e6us of Fordun, the Macbeth of Shakespere. The words of the Worcester Chronicler, \" ac he p\u00e6t lytle hwile heold,\" may refer to Malcolm's death soon after in 1033. Scotland soon fell into confusion, and before long England also. The submission recorded by our two Chroniclers is not to be doubted ; but I confess that I am not quite clear about the date. Both Chroniclers pointedly connect the Scottish expedition with Cnut's return from Rome (\" sona swa he ham com pa for he to Scotlande,\" Wig. \" py ilcan geare he for to Scotlande,\" Petrib.) ; so it is possible that the true date may be 1027 or 1028 instead of 1 03 1. Lastly, there is the curious account of Rudulf Glaber (ii. 2) which I have referred to in the text (see p. 450), and which comes in a passage which I shall have to refer to again. In the year 996 a whale as big as an island came out of the North towards Gaul and portended the troubles which were to come upon Gaul and Britain. In Britain especially there was frightful confusion ; various Kings were striving and wasting the land, till in the end one got the better of them all ; \" Viso . . . Oceani portento exorsus est bellicus tumultus in universali occidentali orbis plaga, videlicet tam in regionibus Galliarum quam in transmarinis Oceani insulis, Anglorum videlicet atque Brittonum necnon et Scotorum. Siqui dem, ut plerumque solet contingere, propter delicta infimi populi, versi in dissensionem illorum reges ac c\u00e6teri principes, statimque exardescentes in subject\u00e6 plebis depopulationem scilicet usque dum perducuntur ad suimet sanguinis effusionem. Quod videlicet tamdiu patratum est in pr\u00e6dictis insulis, quousque unus regum earumdem vi solus potiretur regiminis ceterarum.\" This lucky King of course is Cnut, who is conceived to be King of the West-Saxons. He"], [812, "764 APPENDIX. seizes the kingdom of \u00c6thelred, who is conceived, it would seem, to be King of one of the British islands called Denmark. \" Deni que mortuo rege Adalrado, in regno scilicet illorum qui Danimarches cognominantur, qui etiam duxerat uxorem sororem Ricardi Roto magorum ducis, invasit regnum illius rex videlicet Canuc Occiden talium Anglorum, qui etiam post crebra bellorum molimina ac patri\u00e6 depopulationes, pactum cum Ricardo stabiliens ejusque germanam, Adalradi videlicet uxorem, in matrimonium ducens, utriusque regni tenuit monarchiam.\" It might be refining too much to hint that this wonderful turning about of the dominions of Cnut and \u00c6thelred had anything to do with the strangely reversed state of geographical parties in 1015-1016 (see p. 377). Then follows the account of the Scottish expedition, as follows ; \" Post h\u00e6c quoque idem Canuc cum plurimo exercitu egressus, ut subjugaret sibi gentem Scotorum, quorum videlicet rex Melculo vocabatur, viribus et armis validus et, quod potissimum erat, fide atque opere Christianissimus. Ut autem cognovit quoniam Canuc audacter illius qu\u00e6reret invadere regnum, congregans omnem sui gentis exercitum, potenter ei ne valeret restitit. Ac diu mul tumque talibus procaciter Canuc inserviens jurgiis, ad postremum tantum pr\u00e6dicti Ricardi Rotomagorum ducis ejusque sororis per suasionibus, pro Dei amore, omni prorsus deposita feritate, mitis effectus, in pace deguit. Insuper etiam et Scotorum regem amici ti\u00e6 gratia diligens, illiusque filium de sacro baptismatis fonte excepit.\" One does not quite see why either Emma or Duke Richard or Rudolf Glaber should be seized with such a sudden sit of interest in the affairs of Scotland. Still Rudolf's account is less wonderful than that of a contemporary German writer, Ekke hard the historian of Saint Gallen, who boldly carries Cnut back into the tenth century, and sends Otto the Great over into England to fight against him (Pertz, ii. 119); \" Ottone apud Anglos cum Adaltage, rege ipsorum, socero suo, aliquamdiu agente, ut junctis viribus Chnutonem Danorum debellaret regem.\" Yet Ekkehard was born in 980 and died in 1036."], [813, "THE BATTLE AT THE HELGA. 765 NOTE MMM. p. 454. The Battle at the Helga. This battle is not mentioned in the Abingdon and Worcester Chronicles. Peterborough, followed by Canterbury, places it in 1025. No enemies but Swedes are spoken of, and their com manders are called Ulf and Eglaf. \" p\u00e6r comon ongean Ulf and Eglaf and swiSe mycel here, \u00e6g'Ser ge landhere ge sciphere of SwaSeode.\" Many of Cnut's men, both Danish and English, are killed, \" and pa Sweon h\u00e6fdon weallstowe geweald.\" As for the place of the battle, Cnut is said to go \" to Denmearcon mid scipon to pam Holme \u00e6t ea p\u00e6re halgan.\" See Earle, Parallel Chronicles, p. 342 ; only I do not understand how the \"Helge-Aa\" could be \"then the boundary between Sweden and the Danish possessions,\" as the old frontier of Sweden and Scania lies some way to the north of that river. Ulf and Eglaf are doubtless the sons of Rognvald and Ingebiorg, of whom Snorro speaks in the Saga of Saint Olaf, c. 95 (Laing, ii. 119). At any rate the Ulf spoken of cannot be Ulf the son of Thorgils and brother of Gytha (see above, Note FFF), nor can Eglaf be the Eglaf whom we have already heard of (see p. 447)- But both Snorro in c. 159 (Laing, ii. 246) and Saxo (194, 195) agree in making no mention of the sons of Rognvald, and in making Cnut fight the battle against the two Kings Olaf of Norway and Omund of Sweden. They also agree in bringing in Ulf the son of Thorgils; only they bring him in in quite different characters. Saxo makes him a traitor who has invited the combined Swedish and Norwegian invasion, while Snorro makes him redeem former misdeeds by saving Cnut when in great danger. In the Annales Islandorum (Langebek, iii. 40) the date is given as 1027 and the death of Ulf Thorgilsson is placed in the same year. We can hardly be wrong in accepting the presence of Omund and Olaf on the combined witness of all the Scandinavian writers. But the two Ulfs and Eglaf are puzzling. It has sometimes struck me that \"Ulf and Eglaf\" in our Chroniclers may be a mistake for \" Ulf and Olaf,\" taking of course Saxo's view of the conduct of Ulf Thorgilsson. The Peterborough writer might very easily get wrong in his Ulfs, but he was hardly likely to mistake Saint"], [814, "766 APPENDIX. Olaf, whose history he knew very well, for a man of such small renown as Eglaf Rognvaldsson. It must not be forgotten that it is to this battle that William of Malmesbury and other writers have, with an utter misconcep tion of the result of the battle, transferred Godwine's exploit of 1019. See above, p. 743. Henry of Huntingdon translates the Peterborough Chronicle. Florence, following Abingdon and Wor cester, is silent. NOTE NNN. p. 455. Cnut's Relations with the Empire. Cnut, according to Saxo (196), was lord of six kingdoms ; \"sex pr\u00e6pollentium regnorum possessor effectus.\" But he does not give their names. His commentator Stephanius (p. 212) says, \"nempe Dani\u00e6, Sveci\u00e6, Norvegi\u00e6, Angli\u00e6, Sclavi\u00e6, Sembi\u00e6\" [Semba or Samland in Eastern Prussia?]. The Encomiast (ii. 19) says, \" Quum rex Cnuto solum imprimis Danorum obtineret regimen, quinque regnorum, scilicet Danomarchi\u00e6, Angli\u00e6, Britanni\u00e6, Seo ti\u00e6, Nordweg\u00e6, vendicato dominio, Imperator exstitit.\" Swegen Aggesson (c. 5 ; Lang. i. 54) outdoes them all. Cnut's empire extends over the adjoining realms (\" circumjacentia regna suo aggregavit Imperio\") from Thule to the Byzantine frontier (\"ab ultima Thyle usque ad Gr\u00e6corum ferme Imperium \"), taking in, seemingly, not five or six, but ten kingdoms ; \" quippe Hyberniam, Angliam, Galliam, Italiam, Longobardiam, Teotoniam, Norwagiam, Sclaviam, cum Sambia sibi subjugavit.\" Swegen clearly believes in three Empires, Greek, German, and Scandinavian. His exag gerations may be compared with the exaggerations of Dudo and Rudolf Glaber with regard to the Norman Dukes. On the other hand, Prior Godfrey (Satirical Poets, ii. 148) allows Cnut only three kingdoms, the three most obvious, \"Sic insigne caput trino diademate eingit, Duni Danos, Anglos, Northigenasque regit.' The Danish writers thus paint Cnut as at least the equal of Conrad ; but I am not quite sure that Wipo, in a passage already quoted (see p. 752), where he describes Conrad at his Imperial"], [815, "CNUT'S RELATIONS WITH THE EMPIRE. 767 coronation as walking between the two Kings Cnut and Rudolf, has not a lurking wish to imply that Cnut stood in much the same relation to Conrad that Rudolf did. And the circumstances of the visit, the sight of Pope and C\u00e6sar in all their glory in the old home of both, would be very likely to impress the mind of the still newly-converted lord of Northern Europe, and to make him feel somewhat less Imperial than he felt either at Winchester or at Roskild. But even in Wipo's account there is nothing to make us think that Cnut did more than yield to Conrad the formal precedence to which he was certainly entitled, and above all at such a moment. As to the marriage of Gunhild to King Henry there is no kind of doubt ; but the plain fact has been clouded over with many fables. That the betrothal took place during the reign of Cnut I infer from the account of Adam of Bremen (ii. 54), who after talking largely of Cnut, Archbishop Unwan of Hamburg, and the Emperor Conrad, goes on to say; \" Cum rege Danorum sive Anglo rum, mediante archiepiscopo [Unwan], fecit pacem. Cujus etiam filiam Imperator filio suo deposcens uxorem, dedit ei civitatem Sliaswig cum marcha qu\u00e6 trans Egdoram est, in f\u0153dus amioiti\u00e6 ; et ex eo tempore suit regum Dani\u00e6.\" But there is no doubt that the marriage was not celebrated till 1036, when Cnut was dead. See Wipo, c. 35, who calls the bride Cunehildis, and the Hildesheim Annals in anno (Pertz, iii. 1 00), where we read that \" regina Cunihild nomine ... in natali Apostolorum regalem coronam accepit et mutato nomine in benedictioue Cunigund dicta est.\" See also Hepidanni Annales in anno (ap. Duchesne, Rer. Franc. Scriptt. iii. 479). William of Malmesbury (ii. 188) is so far accurate as to place the marriage after Cnut's death, but he tells the story with great confusion. He grows specially eloquent on the splendour of the bride's progress, just as Roger of Wendover (iv. 332 et seqq.) does over the marriage of Isabella, daughter of John, with Frederick the Second ; but William makes Harthacnut send his sister from England, though Harthacnut certainly was not there in 1036, and he seems to place the marriage after the trial and acquittal of Godwine in 104 1. It was probably this confusion which led him to speak of Henry as \" Imperator Alemannorum,\" for though Henry did not become Emperor till 1046, yet his father"], [816, "768 APPENDIX. died in 1039, leaving to Henry, as Wipo (c. 39) says, \"regni rem, Imperii autem spem, bene locatam.\" Wace also (Roman de Rou, 6552) tells us; \"Gunnil fu a Rome raenie, Et a Rome fu marine ; Fame fu a rEmpereor ; Ne pout aveir plus halt ueignor.\" Besides that Henry was not yet Emperor, the marriage was (see the Hildesheim Annals, u. s.) not celebrated at Rome but at Nimwegen. Gunhild died July 18 th, 1038, \"quasi in limine vit\u00e6,\" as Wipo (c. 37) says, before the death of Conrad. There is another inaccurate account of the marriage in Heming's AVor- cester Cartulary, 267 (Monasticon, i. 596)5 where the bridegroom is described as \" Imperator Cono \" and Brihtheah, Bishop of Worcester, appears as one of the bride's suite ; \" Idem vero episcopus Brihtegus quodam in tempore ad Saxoniam Gunnild\u00e6, Cnuti regis fili\u00e6, ductor exstitit, quum earn Imperator Cono uxorem duceret, et quemdam ministrum sibi valde carum, Hearle- winum nomine, socium itineris secus habuit.\" But the mistakes of all these writers seem pardonable when we turn to the wonderful romance which some of the Scandinavian writers have devised by rolling together the Roman pilgrimage of Cnut, the marriage of Gunhild, and seemingly also the Italian expedition of Conrad and Henry, which happened (see Wipo, c. 35) soon after Henry's marriage. Saxo (196) is comparatively brief. After the descrip- tion of Cnut as lord of six kingdoms, he tells us how he married Gunhild to Henry and then went aud restored the authority of his son-in-law over certain rebels in Italy. \" Canutus . . . eximio sui fulgore etiam Romanum illustravit Imperium. Enimvero ejus principi Henrico filiam Gunnildam nuptum tradidit, eumdemque paullo post Italica consternatione perculsum auxilio prosequutus, pristin\u00e6 fortun\u00e6, pressa rebellium conspiratione, restituit.\" Swegen Aggesson (e. 5 ; Langebek, i. 54) is much fuller. Henry, already Emperor, marries Gunhild ; he is driven from Rome by a sedition, and comes to crave help of his father-in-law (\" quem quum Romani tumultuaria seditione a regio pepulissent solio, socerum adiens ejus auxilium imploravit \"). Cnut, seemingly glad of the chance (\"nactus occasionem illustris ille pr\u00e6cluisque Kanutus\"), sets out to avenge his wrongs. On the road, seemingly by way of pastime, he ravages Gaul (\" assumpto exercitu suo, primo Galliam depopu-"], [817, "CNUT'S RELATIONS WITH THE EMPIRE. 769 laudo invasit \") ; he then harries Lombardy and Italy, which, it will be remembered, Swegen had already reckoned as separate kingdoms, and compels the Romans to receive their Emperor back again (\"multimoda virtute compulit Romanos civitatem sibi resignare, tandemque Imperatorem et generum throno suo resti tuit\"). He then goes to France, which is seemingly looked on as something different from Gaul ; yet most certainly Latin and not Teutonic Francia is intended, for Cnut goes to Tours (\" cum ingenti tripudio ad Franciam usque commeavit, Turonisque pro fectus,\" &c.) and carries off thence (\" potenter secum asportavit \") the relies of Saint Martin, which he translates to Rouen, on account of his great love for that city; \"eo quod illam [Rotho magum] pr\u00e6 ceteris specialem diligeret.\" This wild talk about Rouen must be compared with another equally wild tale which I shall have to mention presently about Cnut dying before Rouen. It is no wonder that Swegen's editor says, \"Mirum est Suen onem et in hoc et in plurimis histori\u00e6 Caimti M. momentis adeo hallucinatum esse.\" Swegen wrote about 1186, in the days of Frederick Barbarossa and Henry the Sixth, and it is worth noting how thoroughly both he and his elder contemporary Wace look on the Roman Emperor as the local sovereign of Rome, in op position to William of Malmesbury's slipshod talk about \"Imperator Alemannorum.\" About Gunhild, William of Malmesbury has a legend which is the same as that of Sir Aldingar and Queen Eleanor in Percy's Reliques. The King's name in both tales is Henry. Gunhild left a daughter, Beatrice, Abbess of Quedlingburg (see Struvius, i. 355). The only English princess, Matilda daughter of Henry the Second, who was the mother of an Emperor, was not the wife of an Emperor or even of a King. On the cession of Sleswiek, Adam, as quoted in the text, seems quite explicit. On the Eider as the boundary of the Carolingian Empire, see the Annals of Einhard, 808, 811, 815, 828, and the Annals of Fulda (Pertz, i. 355 et seqq.), 811, 857, 873. Nothing can be plainer than the last passage, \" fluvium nomine Egidoram, qui illos [Danos] et Saxones dirimit.\" In saying that it remained the boundary till 1866, I should perhaps except the time of confusion, 1806-18 14, when the Roman Empire had been dissolved and when the German Confederation had not yet been founded.

There is no doubt that \u00c6lfred is the name intended. The giant is \" Alvredus cognomento gigas \" in William of Jumieges, and \" Alvredus \" is the name by which he calls the English \u00c6theling \u00c6lfred. In the Roman de Rou he is \"Auvere,\" \"Alverei,\" \" Alvere ; \" the \u00c6theling is \"Auvered\" and \" Alvred.\" So in Mary of France (see Roquefort, ii. 34 and vol. iii. p. 572, iv. p. 796, v. p. 594) \u00c6lfred appears as \"Auvert,\" \"Auvres,\" \"Alurez,\" \"Affrus.\" The only chance against \u00c6lfred being an Englishman is the chance \u2014 a somewhat faint one, I think \u2014 that the name may also have been in use among the Saxons of Bayeux. M. Pluquet (Roman de Rou, ii. 17) says that the name is still common in the district, seemingly under the form of \"Auvray.\" But \" Auvray \" may be \" Alberic ; \" and we shall find that \u00c6lfred and Eadward were just the two English names which we shall find that a later generation of Normans did adopt. I have a note, but I cannot lay my hand on the reference, of a charter of Hugh Capet in 967 signed by \"Alfredus monachus;\" and \" Alfridus abbas Sancti Vulmari\" signs in 1026 (Chron. Sithiense, p. 175) a charter of Baldwin, Bishop of Terouanne. These two can hardly be the same man, but both may be English men. It is more singular to find the name in Italy. Yet we read in Donizo's Life of the Countess Matilda (Murat. v. 372), \"Ac Mons Alfredi capitur certamine freni.\" Was the mount called from any English pilgrim, the great King himself perhaps, or did auy cognate name exist among Goths or Lombards % The elfish names are mainly English ; yet Elberich is said to be the same as \u00c6lfric, and Alboin as \u00c6lfwine.

The Norman and English writers do not mention the marriage of Robert and Estrith. It is asserted by Saxo, Adam of Bremen, and Rudolf Glaber. But the two former tell the story with much confusion, making Estrith marry, not Robert, but Richard. They both connect this marriage with Cnut's own marriage with Emma. Saxo's words (p. 193) are; \"Quum Anglorum rebus obtentis nectendam cum finitimis amicitiam decrevisset, Normanni\u00e6 pr\u00e6fecti [an odd title] Roberti filiam Immam matrimonio duxit, ejusque fratri Rikardo sororem Estritham conjugio potiendam permisit.\" The utter confusion of Saxo's ideas about the Norman Dukes is manifest. Adam (ii. 52) says ; \" Chnud regnum Adalradi accepit uxoremque ejus Immam nomine, qu\u00e6 suit soror comitis Nortmannorum Rikardi. Cui rex Danorum suam dedit germanam Margaretam pro f\u0153dere. Quam deinde Chnut, repudiatam a comite, Wolf duci Angli\u00e6 dedit. . . Et Rikardus quidem comes, declinans iram Chnut, Jherosolimam profectus, ibidem obiit, reliuquens filium in Nortmannia nomiue Rodbertum, cujus fifius est iste Willelmus quem Franci Bastardum vocant.\" Here we get a little light. The marriages of Richard the Good with Judith and Papia are well ascertained, and there is no room left for a marriage with Estrith. But, as Lappenberg remarks (479. Eng. Tr. ii. 217), Adam's mention of the pilgrimage to Jerusalem shows that Robert is the person really meant among all this confusion. Lastly, Rudolf Glaber, a better authority on such a point than Saxo or even than Adam, steps in to settle the matter. He describes (iv. 6. p. 47) Robert's pilgrimage to Jerusalem and his death without lawful issue, \" quamlibet sororem Anglorum 3 D 3"], [820, "APPENDIX. 772 regis Canuc manifestum est duxisse uxorem, quam odiendo divor- tium fecerat.\" This seems to put the fact of a marriage between Robert and Estrith on firm ground. Among the Danish annalists, the Esrom Annals (Lang. i. 236) simply copy Adam of Bremen ; those of Roskild (Lang. i. 377) tell the same tale in different words; \"Kanutus victor exsistens, ipsam Ymmam duxit uxorem, genuitque ex ea filium Hartheknud. Kanutus Ricardo suam dedit sororem nomine Estrid. Qu\u00e6 ab illo repudiata duci Ulf sine fratris consensu [cf. Saxo's tale quoted in p. 746] est conjuncta.\" The name Margaret given by Adam to the Danish princess is remarkable. Estrith might possibly, like Emma and Eadgyth the daughter of Malcolm, have been required to take a Norman name on her marriage. But the name of Margaret, which became popular only through Eadgyth's mother, is rare throughout the century, and this would perhaps be the first instance of it in the West. As for the date of the marriage, see Lappenberg, ii. 217, and Pertz's note to Adam, ii. 52. A dispute between Robert aud Cnut which could be connected, even mythically, with Cnut's death and Robert's pilgrimage must be placed quite late in their reigns. And as the offender is always looked on as the reigning Duke, 1028, or (if we take the reckoning of Florence under 1026 and the Peterborough Chronicle under 1024) 1026, is the earliest year to which the transaction can be referred. Ulf was killed in 1025. William the Bastard was born in 1027 or 1028. As for Estrith's dowry, Saxo tells us that Cnut, before her marriage with Ulf, \" sororem Sialandi\u00e6 redditam regiarum partiuni func tione donavit\" (p. 194). After Ulf's death, execution, or murder, '* Canutus violat\u00e6 necessitudiuis injuriam, ac sororis viduitatem, duarum provinciarum attributione pensavit\" (p. 197). He adds that she gave them to the Church of Roskild. The Roskild Annals (Lang. i. 377) makes her rebuild the church with stone, it having before been of wood ; \" Honorifice sepelivit, ecclesiamque lapideam in loco ligne\u00e6 construxit, quam multis modis ditavit.\" I need haidly say that Cnut's expedition to Normandy is quite mythical. We have already seen (see above, p. 768) a legendary account of a campaign of Cnut in Gaul, including a visit to Rouen, which seems to have grown out of his Roman pilgrimage. The present legend seems further to mingle up with this the pilgrimage of Robert to Jerusalem and the beginning of the Norman exploits"], [821, "CNUT's RELATIONS WITH NORMANDY. 773 in Sicily and Apulia. Saxo, so far as anything can be made out of his chronology, seems to make two Norman expeditions on the part of Cnut. The first (p. 194) seems to be early in his reign; \"Rikardum, acerrimum uxoris osorem effectum, patria exegit.\" Afterwards (pp. 200, 201) we have the story of his great expedition and death before Rouen. Richard is still Duke, but, for fear of Cnut, he flees to Sicily ; \" Cujus [Canuti] impetum Richardus Siciliain petens, fuga pr\u00e6currere maturavit.\" The mention of Sicily is of course suggested by the exploits of the Normans in those regions. Adam, as we have seen, makes Richard flee to Jerusalem. His scholiast adds that the conquest of Apulia was begun by forty of his comrades on their return. The source of confusion is obvious. This wild story of Cnut's death before Rouen seems peculiar to Saxo. Several of the other Danish writers distinctly assert his death in England. Chron. Esrom. ap. Langebek, i. 236 (which makes him die in 1037); Chron. Rosk. i. 377. The attempt of Robert against England is described by William of Jumieges (vi. 10, n) and Wace (Roman de Rou, 7897 et seqq.). I have followed their account in the text. Only two English writers mention it, William of Malmesbury (ii. 180) and John of Walling ford (Gale, 549\u2014550). William mentions only the intended invasion, and says nothing of the embassies before and after it. John of Wallingford tells the story much as William of Jumieges does, only, with the usual confusion, he talks of Richard instead of Robert. But it is plain from the two Williams that Robert was the Duke concerned, so that John of Wallingford is clearly wrong when he places the story in the first years of Cnut \u2014 \" in primordiis regni sui.\" William of Jumieges (vi. 10) thus describes the message sent by Robert to Cnut ; \" Mandavit Chunuto regi ut jamjamque satiates eorum [the \u00c6thelings] exterminio illis parceret, et sua eis vel sero pro sui amoris obtentu redderet,\" So John of Wallingford; \"Venerunt legati a Normannia ... qui cum Cnutone de regni jure disceptantes juvenibus pr\u00e6dictis regnum postulabant.\" William of Jumieges, it should be mentioned, distinctly implies the personal presence of Robert on board the fleet, but says nothing of that of the \u00c6theling. Wace (7941) speaks of both Robert and Eadward."], [822, "APPENDIX. 774 NOTE QQQ. p. 480. The Division of Cnut's Dominions. That Cnut, like Charles, established a system of under-king doms, to be held by his sons in subordination to his own Imperial authority, is distinctly asserted by Saxo (196). \" Inde [from Rome, see p. 768] reversus, Haraldum natu majorem Angli\u00e6, Dani\u00e6 Canutum, Norvagi\u00e6 Suenonem, quem ex Alvina sustulerat, absque ulla majestatis su\u00e6 diminutione pr\u00e6fecit. Nam etsi tres provincias totidem filiorum regimini tradidit, nihilominus commune sibi trium imperium reservavit, neque summam penes alium con sistere voluit. Pr\u00e6terea teneris adhuc ducibus in officiorum tutelam fortissimorum pr\u00e6sidia sociavit.\" The Knytlinga Saga (c. 17 ; Johnstone, 144) gives a similar account, only instead of England, it makes Harold Under-king over part of Scotland (see above, p. 761); \" Knutr konungr bafdi oc til forrada mikinn hlut as Skotlandi, oc setti hann par Haralld son sinn konung ysir : enn bo var Knutr konungr ysir-konungr [overkonge] allra peirra.\" Now this statement that Cnut established his sons as Under-kings under the guardianship of some of his chief men falls in exactly with the statement in our own Chronicles that Thurkill was established in Denmark as guardian to one of Cnut's sous (see p. 429). The words of the passage (1023) are, \"And he bet\u00e6hte pureille Denemearcan and his sunu to healdenne ; \" but the details of this arrangement, as described both in Saxo and in the saga, seem open to much doubt. There is not a shadow of evidence that Harold ever reigned as Under-king in England, and the statement that he reigned in Scotland, though very remarkable, is hardly to be accepted without better authority than that of the Knytlinga Saga. The further question arises, who was the son whom Cnut left in Denmark 1 Not Harthacnut, who succeeded him there, for that kingly bairn was with his mother in England (see Chron. Wig. in anno). It must have been one of the two doubtful sons, Swegen and Harold, whom it may have been con venient to remove from England, together with their mother, \" the other \u00c6lfgifu.\" She and Swegen, it is well known, were after wards quartered in Norway, and this looks as if Harold were now,"], [823, "THE CANDIDATURE OP HAROLD AND HARTHACNUT. 775 in the like sort, quartered in Denmark. This would prove a change of purpose on Cnut's part as to the succession of his children, as it was Harthacnut who actually succeeded him in Denmark. On Swegen's reign in Norway under the guardianship of his mother, see Saxo, 196; Snorro, c 252 ; Laing, ii. 344. I suspect that Saxo conceived the three sons as having been Under-kings in the several kingdoms to which they actually succeeded ; but if it be true, as seems likely, that Harold was first quartered as Under king in Denmark and afterwards displaced to make way for Harthacnut, the fact becomes of importance with reference to the disputed election which followed his death. As to the division on Cnut's death there seems no doubt at alL The account given by Adam (ii. 72) runs thus; \"Post cujus mortem, ut ipse disposuit, succedunt in regnum filii ejus, Haroldus in Angliam, Svein in Nortmanniam, Hardechnut autem in Daniam. . . . Suein et Harold a concubina geniti erant ; qui, ut mos est barbaris, \u00e6quam tune inter liberos Chnut sortiti sunt partem h\u00e6reditatis.\" This is copied by the Esrom Chronicle, Lang. i. 237; cf. Chron. Rosk. p. 377 ; Chron. Erici, p. 159. As Harold actually succeeded in England, foreign writers seem to have taken for granted that his succession was in accordance with Cnut's will ; but it is evident that Cnut latterly intended England for Hartha cnut. On the expulsion of Swegen and \u00c6lfgifu from Norway, see Snorro, Saga of Magnus, c. 4 ; Laing, ii. 363. NOTE RRR. p. 482. The Candidature of Harold and Harthacnut. I have gathered my account of this disputed election wholly from our own Chronicles, which are the only trustworthy guides. The cause of all the difficulties and contradictions with which the subject is involved, is the fact that the division of the kingdom between Harold and Harthacnut proved a mere ephemeral arrangement, and was set aside within two years. It seems therefore to have quite passed out of mind, except with the very"], [824, "APPENDIX. 776 few writers with whom minute accuracy was really an object. No one would find out the fact from Adam of Bremen, from the Encomiast, or even from William of Malmesbury. Of the Danish writers it is needless to speak. The Encomiast (iii. i et seqq.) sees, so does William of Malmesbury (ii. 188) still more plainly, that a strong opposition was made to the election of Harold ; they do not see that that opposition was so far successful that a temporary sovereignty over a part of the kingdom was secured to Harthacnut. Even Florence, seemingly hesitating, as he sometimes does, between two versions of a story, tells the tale with some confusion. But on comparing the Abingdon, Worcester, and Peterborough Chronicles, the matter becomes much clearer. The Peterborough Chronicle is the primary authority for the division of parties in the Witenagemot, for the division of the kingdom between the two competitors, for the regency of Emma and Godwine on behalf of Harthacnut. Its statements are copied, with more or less of confusion and misconception, by the Canterbury Chronicle, Florence, and William of Malmesbury. The Abingdon and Worcester Chronicles do not distinctly mention the division of the kingdom under the year 1035 ; but they imply it under 1037, in the words, \" Her man geceas Harald ofer eall to cinge, and forsoc HarSacnut,\" which, unless Harthacnut had before possessed part of the kingdom, would be meaningless. Oddly enough, the Peterborough Chronicler does not distinctly mention this second election of Harold, though he perhaps alludes to it in the words, \" And he [Harold] w\u00e6s p\u00e6h full cyng ofer eall Englaland.\" Thus the two accounts in the Chronicles fill up gaps in each other, and between the two we get a full and consistent narrative. I believe the controversy to have lain wholly between the two soils of Cnut, Harold and Harthacnut. That there was a party in favour of one of the sons of \u00c6thelred (see p. 476) is asserted by William of Malmesbury (ii. 188); \"Angli diu obstiterunt, magis unum ex filiis Ethelredi, qui in Normannia morabantur, vel Harde cnutum filium Cnutonis ex Emma, qui tune in Danemarchia erat, regem habere volentes.\" But in the Chronicles, where the pro ceedings in the Witenagemot are described, we hear nothing of any voices being raised on the side of the \u00c6thelings, and William himself says (u. s.) of a time a little later ; \" Filii Ethelredi jam fere omnibus despectui erant, magis propter patern\u00e6 socordi\u00e6"], [825, "THE CANDIDATURE OF HAROLD AND HARTHACNUT. 777 memoriam, quam propter Danorum potentiam.\" These last words are at least a witness to the freedom of election on this occasion. The geographical division of parties is clearly marked in the Peterborough Chronicle, which is also the only one which notices the share taken by London in the election. We now hear only of the \" liSsmen,\" not, as in the election of 1016, of the \"burhwaru.\" The proposal for a division I understand to come from Harold's supporters, most likely from Leofric, the natural mediator be tween the two extreme parties. I do not see what else can be the meaning of the expression in the Peterborough Chronicle that Leofric and others chose Harold and Harthacnut (\" Leofric eorl and m\u00e6st ealle pa, pegenas be norSan Teme=e and pa liSsmen on Lunden gecuron Harold to healdes Englelandes ; him and his broker Ilardacnute, pe w\u00e6s on Denemearcon \"). This proposal \u2014 namely the division \u2014 Godwine and the West-Saxons resist (\" and Godwine eorl and ealle pa, yldestan menu on West-Seaxon lagon ongean, swa hi lengost mihton ; ac hi ne mihton nan ping ongean wealcan \") ; that is, they claim the whole kingdom for Harthacnut. At last they are obliged to consent to the division and the regency (\" and man ger\u00e6dde pa p\u00e6t \u00c6lfgifu Hardacnutes modor s\u00e6te on Winceastre mid p\u00e6s cynges huscarlum hyra suna, and heoldan ealle West-Seaxan him to handa ; aud Godwine eorl was heora healdest man\"). Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 758 B) trans lates this account, but he was evidently puzzled by the words about electing Harold and Harthacnut, as he says, \"elegerunt Haraldum, ut conservaret regnum fratri suo Hardecnut \" \u2014 a most unlikely story. The last clause he translates; \" Consilium ergo inierunt quod Emma regina cum regis defuncti familia [huscarlum 1] conservaret Westsexe apud Wincestre in opus filii sui, Godwinus vero consul dux eis esset in re militari.\" Henry says nothing of the second election of Harold in 1037. William of Malmesbury (ii. 188), though telling the story in a most confused way, seems quite to take in the position of Godwine ; \" Maximus turn justiti\u00e6 propugnator suit Godwinus comes, qui etiam pupillorum [his notion about the sons of \u00c6thelred, as well as Harthacnut, here comes in] se tutorem professus, reginam Emmam et regias gazas custodiens, resistentes umbone nominis sui aliquamdiu dispuht ; sed tandem, vi et numero impar, cessit violenti\u00e6.\" Mr. St. John (Four Conquests, ii. 106, 107) makes Godwine first assert the"], [826, "778 APPENDIX. rights of the \u00c6thelings, which I suppose is his interpretation of the words of William, and then himself propose the compromise in favour of Harthacnut. For this he refers us to Simeon ; but Simeon (X Scriptt. 179) only copies the narrative of Florence, and that narrative, as well as that of the \" Saxon Chronicle \" [Abingdon as opposed to Peterborough ?], Mr. St. John had just before cast aside as \"confusing the whole subject.\" I see that the idea of the Imperial supremacy being reserved to Harold has also occurred to Mr. St. John (ii. no). It was sug gested to me by the words of the Peterborough Chronicle (evidently misunderstood by the Canterbury Chronicler), \" And he [Harold] w\u00e6s p\u00e6h full cyng ofer eall Englaland.\" This however, as I remarked just above, may perhaps refer to Harold's second election in 1037. The same idea might also lurk in the other words of the Peterborough Chronicler, quoted in the last page, \" gecuron Harold to healdes ealles Englelandes ; him and his broSer Hardacnute,\" &c. But an Imperial supremacy on the part of Harold seems quite consistent with the general tenor of events, and such a supposition may perhaps render the account of the fate of the \u00c6theling \u00c6lfred one degree less obscure. The story of \u00c6thelnoth's refusal to crown Harold comes wholly from the Encomium Emm\u00e6, iii. 1. But it is possible that the tale, if true, may belong to the second election of Harold in 1037, and may have been thrust back in the confused chronology of the Encomiast. A coronation, sooner or later, seems quite certain. It is asserted by Ralph de Diceto, ii. 238, ed. Stubbs; \"Haroldus filius Cnutonis regnavit annis iii. consecratus ab Ethelnodo Doro bernensi archiepiscopo apud Lundonias.\" So Roger of Wendover (i. 473); \"Pr\u00e6valuit pars Haroldi, et regni Angli\u00e6 ilium diade mate insignivit.\" According to Bromton (X Scriptt. 932), Harold was \"ab Ethelnodo Doroberaensi archiepiscopo apud Lundonias consecratus.\" But the higher authority of the list of coronations in Rishanger (427) places it at Oxford,\" which seems to have been Harold's capital. Believers in the false Ingulf may also entertain themselves with a story about Harold's coronation robe, and a great deal more about which authentic history is silent. See St. John, ii. 107-110."], [827, "THE DEATH OF THE \u00c6THELING \u00c6LFRED. 779 NOTE SSS. p. 489. The Death of the \u00c6theling \u00c6lfred. I have stated in the text the chief versions as to the death of \u00c6lfred. The different statements may be grouped under two main heads, those which put the event at its right date under the reign of Harold, and those which move it to some other time. It is the former class whose statements we must weigh against other ; the latter are useful mainty as illustrating particular points, and as examples of the way in which legends grow. The earliest English account is that which is found, in different shapes, in the Abingdon and Worcester Chronicles. Peterborough is silent about the whole matter. The story, except a few lines at the beginning, takes the form of a ballad, as it appears in Mr. Earle's Parallel Chronicles. It is astonishing that Mr. Thorpe should have printed it as plain prose, when it plainly is, not only, like the songs of Brunanburh and Maldon, in rhythm, but actually in rime. This was seen long ago by Dr. Ingram, who not only printed it as verse, but attempted a riming version of his own in modern English. I have in the text analysed the account thus given. The remarkable point is that the Abingdon Chronicle distinctly accuses Godwine, while the Worcester version leaves out his name. In the prose introduction, \u00c6lfred the innocent (\" un sceSSiga\") \u00c6theling lands and wishes to go to his mother, who sat at Winchester. Then says Abingdon, \"Ac hit himne gejjafode Godwine eorl ne ec opre men pe mycel mihton wealdan : forpan hit hleoSrode pa swiSe toward Haraldes, peh hit unriht w\u00e6re.\" But in Worcester it stands, \"Ac p\u00e6t ne gepafodon f>a pe micel weoldon on pisan lande ; forpan hit hleoprade pa swiSe to Harolde, peah hit unriht w\u00e6re.\" So the beginning of the ballad stands in Abingdon, \"Ac Godwine hine J>a gelette, And hine on h\u00e6ft sette;\" while in the Worcester version it runs, \"Da let he [Harold] hine on h\u00e6ft settan.\" There can be no doubt that here the Abingdon version is the original, and that the Worcester text, which destroys rhythm and"], [828, "780 AFPENDIX. rime, was altered by an admirer of Godwine. But as to the prose introduction the case is far less clear ; the words \" Godwine eorl ne ec o}>re men\" might just as well be an interpolation. So in Florence the mention of Godwine comes in very awkwardly; \" Quod indigne graviterque ferebant potentes nonnulli, quia, licet injustum esset, Haroldo multo devotiores exstitere quam illis, maxime, utfertur, comes Godwinus.\" Florence's version is made up by modifying the account in the Chronicles, with some touches from other quarters. He makes both brothers come, changing the words \"\u00c6lfred se unsceSSiga \u00e6peling\" into \" innocentes clitones \u00c6lfredus et Eadwardus.\" While in the Chronicles \u00c6lfred simply wishes to go to his mother (\" wolde to his moder pe on Wincestre s\u00e6t\"), and is hindered by certain men, Godwine or others, in this account both the \u00c6thelings actually visit their mother (\" ad su\u00e6 matris colloquium, qu\u00e6 morabatur Wintoni\u00e6, venere \"), and Godwine and the other powerful men are simply displeased at their coming (\" indigne graviterque ferebant,\" as above). Then comes the strangest part of his statement; that Godwine seized and imprisoned \u00c6lfred is simply translated from the ballad, but Florence now introduces the almost incomprehen sible assertion that \u00c6lfred, when he was seized, was going to London for a conference with Harold ; \" Hie quidem [Godwinus] \u00c6lfredum, quum versus Lundoniam, ad regis Haroldi colloquium, ut mandarat, properaret, retinuit, et arcta in custodia posuit [' hine pa gelette and hine on h\u00e6ft sette '].\" The companions of \u00c6lfred, to the number of six hundred, are sold, killed, or tortured at Guildford; the place is not mentioned in the Chronicles. Emma then sends back her son Eadward, who had stayed with her (\" qui secum remansit \") and had not set out with his brother, with all haste to Normandy. Then, at the bidding of Godwine and certain others (\"Godwini et quorumdam aliorum jussione\"), \u00c6lfred is taken to Ely, and the rest of the story follows as in the ballad. It is plain that Florence in writing this had one or both of the Chronicles before him, and tried to work in details from other sources which were really inconsistent with the account which the Chronicles gave. One change is of special importance. The ballad simply mentions the companions (\" geferan \") of \u00c6lfred without any account of their number or who they were. Florence makes"], [829, "THE DEATH OF THE \u00c6THELING \u00c6LFRED. 781 them six hundred, and adds the very important statement that they were Norman knights or soldiers. The \u00c6thelings come, \" multis Normannicis militibus secum assuniptis, in Angliam paucis trausvecti navibus.\" This touch clearly comes from the Norman version, which represents the first attempt of the \u00c6thelings as an actual invasion, an idea which the Chronicles do not suggest. It is also plainly from the same source that he got the idea that Eadward had any share in the busiuess. The ballad in the two Chronicles has about it something of that vagueness which is natural in a poem which is rather a pious lamentation than a narrative. The Norman account, true or false, is at least fuller and clearer. It first appears in William of Poitiers, the Conqueror's chaplain, the extant part of whose narrative begins at this point. He is followed by William of Jumieges (vii. 8, 9), who is followed by Wace (Roman de Rou, 9759 et seqq.). I have given the substance of their story in the text, and I do not know that there is anything to remark, except that at the end of his tale William of Poitiers turns round aud reviles Godwine in an address in the second person, much as at a later stage of his nai rative he reviles Harold. We now come to the version of the Encomiast. He is a perplexing writer to deal with ; one knows not what to make of an historian who was either so easily imposed upon or else so utterly reckless as to truth. A contemporary writer who wipes out Emma's marriage with \u00c6thelred, who looks on the \u00c6thelings as sons of Cnut, who is ignorant that his heroine was actually Queen-regent over Wessex, is really somewhat of a curiosity. His astounding statement (ii. 18) that Eadward and \u00c6lfred were the sons of Cnut I have already spoken of in Note BBB. In his present account (iii. 1) Emma remained in England after the death of Cnut, grieving for the death of her husband and the absence of her sons (\" sollicita pro filiorum absentia\"). He then goes on; \"Namque unus eorum, Hardecnuto scilicet, quem pater regem Danorum constituit, suo morabatur in regno; duo vero alii in Normanni\u00e6 finibus ad nutriendum traditi, cum piopinquo suo degebant Rotberto.\" These last are the sons of whom one, \u00c6lfred, the younger of the two (\" Alfridus miuor natu,\" iii. 4), is the victim of the present story. It is plain therefore that the \"liberales filii\" of Cnut, spoken of in the former passage, aie meant to be the"], [830, "782 APPENDIX. same as the \u00c6thelings. All three brothers being absent, \" factum est,\" he goes on to say, \" ut quidam Anglorum, pietatem regis sui jam defuncti obliti, mallent regnum suum dedecorare quam ornare, relinquentes nobiles filios insignis regin\u00e6 Emm\u00e6, et eligentes sibi in regem quemdam Haroldum,\" &c, &c. (see above, p. 775). He then goes on with \u00c6thelnoth's refusal to crown Harold (see above, p. 487), and with Harold's ungodly manner of life (see p. 504). Then comes the forged letter and the rest of the story, as I have told it in the text. The piece of detail most worthy of notice is the writer's remarks (iii. 5) on the decimation of \u00c6lfred's com panions (on the alleged decimation at Canterbury in 10 12, see above, p. 674); \" Traditi sunt carnificibus, quibus etiam jussum ut nemini parcerent nisi quem sors decima offerret. Tune tortores vinctos ordinatim sedere fecerunt, satis supraque eis insultantes, illius interfectoris Theb\u00e6\u00e6 legionis exemplo usi sunt, qui decimavit primum innocentes multo his mitius. Hie enim rex paganissimus Christianorum novem pepercit, occiso decimo : at hi profanissimi falsissimique Christiani bonorum Christianorum novem perimerunt, decimo dimisso.\" Now when a writer, whether through ignorance or through design, goes so utterly wrong about the birth of his hero, about the position of his heroine aud the general condition of the kingdom, one hardly knows how to accept anything that he tells us. Yet his account, if used with caution, seems to supply some useful hints. His account is the only one which, while consistent with Godwine's innocence, explains the origin of the belief as to his guilt. If we accept his account of what happened between Godwine and \u00c6lfred, the various statements become intelligible; we see how the opposite stories could arise, which in any other way it is hard to see. The tale of the forged letter has a very odd sound, and the details may easily be mythical. Yet something of the kind would fill up the gap in the Chronicles, in which \u00c6lfred comes over to England without any particular reason for his coming, better than William of Poitiers' wild tale of a Norman invasion, which is most likely a mere repetition of the attempt of Robert. The Encomiast seems to have had no notion that Emma was at Winchester, but rather to have fancied that she was in London. \u00c6lfred, before he has landed, is recognized by his enemies, who"], [831, "THE DEATH OF THE \u00c6THELING \u00c6LFRED. 783 wish to seize him (\" volebant eum adgredi,\" iii. 4), but he escapes, lands elsewhere, and sets out to go to his mother (\" matrem parabat adire \"). When he has got near to her (\" ubi jam erat proximus \"), he is met by Godwine, who persuades him not to go to London, and takes him to Guildford (\" devians eum a Londonia, induxit eum in villa Gildefordia nuncupata \"). The mistake is remarkable, for to quarter Emma in London instead of at Winchester implies utter ignorance as to her real position. But it seems quite plain that the Encomiast did not mean to identify Godwine either with the \" adversarii \" of \u00c6lfred whom he had mentioned just before, nor yet with the \"complices Haroldi infandissimi tyranni\" (iii. 5), who are spoken of afterwards. And he expressly shuts out the story of invasion and battle which appears in William of Poitiers. The companions of \u00c6lfred are indeed called \" commilitones \" (iii. 4), but, when Baldwin offers him the help of an armed force, he declines it (\" cum marchione Balduino moratus, et ab eo rogatus ut aliquam partem su\u00e6 militi\u00e6 secum duceret propter insidias hostium \"). This seems to forbid the notion of a force such as the Norman writers speak of, a force which could dream of the conquest of England or even of Wessex. The only other independent witness is the strong partizan of Godwine, the Biographer of Eadward (Vita Eadw. 401). He perhaps shows some wish to slur the story over ; but his account of the time between the death of Cnut and the election of Eadward is throughout confused and meagre. He brings in the story of \u00c6lfred only incidentally, not in its chronological place, but much later, when describing the attempts of the Norman Archbishop Robert to bow dissensions between King Eadward and the Earl. He merely says that \u00c6lfred, incautiously entering the country with some French companions, was seized and put to death by torture by order of Harold, his comrades being killed, sold, and so forth. As Godwine was still, under Harold as under Cnut, the chief counsellor of the King (\" eo quoque tempore, ut superius, regalium consiliorum erat bajalus.\" See above, p. 733), the slanderer Robert took occasion to affirm that the deed was done by Godwine's advice ; but the Biographer strongly asserts the Earl's innocence. These are the earliest accounts of the business, all of them written by men who were alive at the time, and of whom the Encomiast of Emma personally knew Cnut, while the Biographer"], [832, "APPENDIX. 784 of Eadward personally knew Godwine. Their differences aud contradictions are therefore the more amazing ; and their one point of agreement is more amazing still, namely, that they all forget, as I said in the text, that Emma and Godwine were ruling in Wessex in the name, not of Harold, but of Harthacnut. The division of the kingdom, the regency of Emma and Godwine, are facts which cannot be doubted ; they are affirmed by two of the Chronicles and they are implied by the other two (see above, p. 776). But in telling the tale of \u00c6lfred all this is forgotten. Even the Biographer of Eadward, the formal apologist of Godwine, seems, in the very act of defending him, to forget his real position. The Encomiast, whose version is the most favourable to Godwine's innocence, seems to know nothing of any King Lut Harold ; Godwine, if not Harold's minister, is at least Harold's subject. On comparing all these writers, the question at once arises, How far, when their main story involves so great a misconception, can we trust any of their details 1 The inconsistency is manifest ; it seems to have been felt at the time. The ballad which laments the fate of the \u00c6theling is found only in those Chronicles which do not directly mention the division of the kingdom. And, even of these, one inserts the ballad in a form which does not accuse Godwine. The Peterborough Chronicler, who is so clear as to the division of the kingdom, says nothing about the fate of the \u00c6theling. The Norman writers, so eloquent about the fate of the \u00c6theling, know nothing of the kingship of Harthacnut. Florence, who attempts to combine the two stories, falls into all kinds of confusions aud inconsistencies. It was no doubt the feeling of this inconsistency, the feeling that the story, as told, could not have happened at the time to which it is fixed, which made later writers, from William of Malmesbury onwards, move it to various other dates. William's own account (ii. 188) is very remarkable. He haidly believes the story, because it is not in the Chronicles, but he tells it, because it was a common report ; \" Quia fama serit, non omisi ; sed quia chronica tacet, pro solido non asserui.\" He therefore had the Peterborough Chronicle before him. So just before ; \" Sane ne silentio premam quod de primogenito [\u00c6lfred was certainly the younger] Ethelredi Elfredo rumigeruli spargunt.\" The tale is placed by him in 1040, after the death of Harold and before the arrival of Hai thacnut. Sir Thomas Hardy, in his note,"], [833, "THE DEATH OF THE \u00c6THELING \u00c6LFRED. 785 proposes to read \"mortem Cnutonis\" for \"mortem Haroldi,\" but this is rather destroying evidence than explaining it. \u00c6lfred enters the kingdom ; by the treachery of his countrymen, chiefly of Godwine (\" compatriotarum perfidia et maxime Godwini \"), he is blinded at Gillingham (probably a mistake for Guildford) ; thence he is taken to Ely, where he soon dies. His companions are beheaded, save one out of each ten, who are allowed to escape. This date, if it rested on any authority, would be far more probable than the other. Henry of Huntingdon (M. H. B. 758 D) pushes on the story yet a reign further. It is now placed after the death of Harthacnut in 1042. On that King's death the English send for \u00c6lfred, the elder of the \u00c6thelings, to succeed to the Crown. He comes, and brings with him a great number of his mother's kinsfolk and of other Normans. Now Godwine (\" quum esset consul fortissimus et proditor s\u00e6vissimus\") has determined that the new King shall marry his daughter. But he sees that \u00c6lfred's high spirit (\"quia primogenitus erat et magn\u00e6 probitatis\") will not consent to this scheme, while he thinks that the milder spirit of Eadward (\" frater minor et simplicior \") will submit to the yoke. Godwine then harangues the Witan (\" intimavit igitur proceribus Angli\u00e6 \") ; \u00c6lfred has brought with him too many Normans ; he has promised them lands in England ; it will not be safe to allow so valiant and so crafty a people to take root in the land ; the strangers must be punished lest other strangers should venture to presume on their kindred with Kings to meddle with Englishmen and English affairs (\"ne alii posth\u00e6c audeant pro regis cognatione se Anglis ingerere \"). \u00c6lfred's Norman companions are then decimated at Guildford, in the fashion above mentioned ; but even the tenth part seem to the English too many to be allowed to live (\" nimium visum est Anglis tot superesse \") ; so they are decimated again; the \u00c6theling is blinded and sent to Ely, as before. Ralph the Black (157) brings in his version incidentally. Under the reign of Harthacnut, he says, \" Edwardum fratrem suum a Normannis revocans, secum pacifice aliquamdiu habuit. Nam alter frater, Aluredus scilicet, ad stipitem ligatus a Godwino in Hely peremptus est, ter decimatis commilitonibus apud Guldedune, port mortem Haroldi, antequam regnaret Hardecnutus, consilio Stigandi archiepiscopi.\" This last strange statement may be taken in connexion with a scandal which charged Emma herself with a 3E VOL. I."], [834, "APPENDIX. 786 partnership in the deed. (See p. 498 and Note SSS.) There is no need to point out that Stigand was not Archbishop untill long afterwards. Bromton (X Scriptt. 934 et seqq.) gives several versions, but decides in favour of one grounded on that of Henry of Huntingdon. He adds several particulars, especially that the English nobles were so enraged against Godwine that they vowed that he should die a worse death than Eadric the betrayer of his cyne-hlaford (\"dominum suum naturalem regem\") Eadmund. (It is a little remarkable that these words are used without any hint as to the supposed kindred between Godwine and Eadric.) On this Godwine flees to Denmark and remains there four years, his lands and goods being meanwhile confiscated. But Bromton's most remarkable version is one in which the death of \u00c6lfred, combined with an attempt to poison Eadward, is attributed to the joint action of Godwine, Harthacnut, and Emma herself. The same scandal turns up again in the Winchester Annals (Luard, Ann. Mon. ii. 22) as part of the legend of Emma and the ploughshares. So also in Bromton himself, X Scriptt. 942. But the Winchester Annalist had just before (Ann. Mon. ii. 17) given his own ver sion. The tale is placed in the reign of Harthacnut. Godwine wishes to open the succession to his own son Harold. He entices \u00c6lfred over \u2014 Duke Robert, notwithstanding his death and burial in the East, keeps Eadward back in Normandy \u2014 and causes one tenth of his companions to be beheaded, the rest to be tortured and crucified, and the \u00c6theling himself to be em bowelled. Godwine's instructions to his agents are given in two very graphic speeches. I trust that so pleasant a writer as Richard of the Devizes is not answerable for this stuff. See Mr. Luard's Preface, p. xi. Lastly, two charters ascribed to Eadward the Confessor, but of very doubtful genuineness, speak of the murder of \u00c6lfred in a way which ought to be noticed. In the first (Cod. Dipl. iv. 173) Eadward is made to attribute the death of his brother to Harold and Harthacnut conjointly, and to speak of himself as being with difficufty rescued from them ; \" Invadentibus regnum Swegeno et Cnuto filio regis [ejus ?], regibus Danorum, ac filiis ipsius Chnuti Haroldo et Hardechnuto, a quibus etiam alter meus frater \u00c6lfredus crudeliter occisus est, solusque, sicut Joas occisionem OSoli\u00e6, eic"], [835, "THE BURIAL OF HAROLD THE FIRST. 787 ego illorum crudelitatem evasi.\" In the other (Cod. Dipl. iv. 181) the crime is attributed to the Danes generally; \"Dani qui ... . fratrem meum alium \u00c6lfredum miserabiliter interemptum ene caverant.\" Now, even if these charters be spurious, they still have a certain value as witnessing to popular belief on the subject. Neither of them mentions Godwine ; had they done so, Godwine's sons could hardly have been represented as signing them. But the mention of the fact in charters signed by them might imply that the subject was not one which they at all sought to avoid. The second charter is perfectly vague; but the language of the former, attributing the deed to Harold and Harthacnut, is remark able. That Harthacnut personally had no hand in it needs no proof; neither was Eadward at any time in the least danger at the hands of Harthacnut, who always acted towards him as an attached brother. Is the charge against Harthacnut meant to convey an indirect charge against the representative of Harthacnut, that is, against Emma herself 1 I have thus fairly put together, as far as I can, the evidence on this most perplexing question. That \u00c6lfred landed and was put to death by order of Harold there can be no reasonable doubt. But one can hardly say more, except that, of all the accounts of his coming, the least likely is that which connects it with a Norman invasion under the command of Eadward. The charge against Godwine implies a state of things which we know not to have existed ; on the other hand it is strange that his one direct apologist should not have used so obvious an argument on his behalf. In my whole history I know no more remarkable instance of mistakes and contradictions on the part of writers who had every means of being well informed. NOTE TTT. p. 512. The Burial of Harold the First. The Peterborough Chronicle (1040) distinctly says that Harold died at Oxford; \"Her forSferde Harold cyng on Oxnaforda on xi. Kal. Apr. and he w\u00e6s bebyrged \u00e6t Westmynstre.\" Worcester and Abingdon say merely \"Her swealt Harold cyng,\" without any 3\""], [836, "788 APPENDIX. mention of the place either of death or of burial. Canterbury has, \"Her foi-Sferde Harold cing, and he wearS bebyrged at West mynstre.\" Florence however says \"obiit Lundoni\u00e6.\" That the place of his death was Oxford can hardly be doubted, when we remember the charter which I have quoted at pp. 505, 509. And the point is of some importance in relation to the burial of Westminster, which becomes still more remarkable in the case of a King who died so far off as Oxford. As for the disinterment of Harold's body by order of Harthacnut, two stories seem to have been afloat which Florence tried to put into one. His words are ; \" Mox ut regnare c\u0153pit injuriarum, quas vel sibi vel su\u00e6 genitrici suus antecessor fecerat rex Haroldus, qui frater suus putabatur, non immemor, \u00c6lfricum Eboracensem archiepiscopum, Godwinum comitem, Stir majorem domus, Edricum dispensatorem, Thrond suum carnificem, et alios magn\u00e6 dignitatis viros, Lundoniam misit, et ipsius Haroldi corpus effodere, et in gronnam projicere jussit : quod quum projectum fuisset, id extrahere, et in flumen Thamense man davit projicere. Brevi autem post tempore a quodam piscatore captum est, et ad Danos allatum sub festinatione, in ccemeterio quod habuerunt Lundoni\u00e6 sepultum est ab ipsis cum honore.\" Here we find a mention both of a fen and of the river Thames as places into which the body was successively thrown. If we look iuto other accounts, we shall find one story speaking of the fen, and another of the river. The Peterborough Chronicle is silent ; the Abingdcn and Worcester speak of the fen ; \" He let dragan up pone deadan Harold ; and hine on fenn onsceotan.\" William of Malmes bury (ii. 188) tells the story like the second part of the story in Florence, except that he adds that the body was beheaded, which Florence does not mention ; also he does not choose to mention any of the performers in the disinterment except \u00c6lfric. His account runs thus ; \" Per Alfricum Eboracensem episcopum, et alios quos nominare piget, Haroldi cadavere defosso, caput truncari, et miserando mortalibus exemplo, in Tamesim projici jussit. Id a quodam piscatore exceptum sagena, in ccemeterio Danorum Londoni\u00e6 tumulatur.\" The special mention of \u00c6lfric is remarkable. It may be that the presence of a prelate was needed to sanctify the insult to"], [837, "THE TRIAL AND ACQUITTAL OF GODWINE. 789 consecrated ground ; still \u00c6lfweard would have been the more natural performer in his own diocese. And William of Malmesbury elsewhere (De Gest. Pont. 250) distinctly asserts that the deed was done by the special advice of \u00c6lfric ; \" Habetur [\u00c6lfricus] in hoc detestabilis, quod Hardacnutus ejus consilio fratris sui Haroldi cadavere defbsso capiut truncari, et infami mortalibus exemplo in Tamensem projici jussit.\" The burying-place of the Danes seems to be first mentioned by William of Malmesbury. Ralph deDiceto (i. 186 ed. Stubbs) marks it as the same as the church of Saint Clement Danes ; \" Brevi autem post a quodam piscatore ad Danos allatum est, et in ccemeterio quod habuerunt Lundoni\u00e6 sepultum est apud sanctum Clementem.\" He is followed by Bromton (933), who however only speaks of the church of Saint Clement without any special mention of Danes. Florence's list of the dignitaries employed in this matter is followed by most of the later writers. Roger of Wendover calls them \" milites et carnifices.\" On the relation of the great Earls to the officers of the King's household, see above, p. 89. The mention of the \" major domus \" and the seemingly dignified position of \" Thrond carnifex \" (cf. Jeremiah Hi. 12) should be specially noticed. It is really worth while to transcribe the narrative of M. de Bonnechose (ii. 61); it is so amusingly coloured; \"Le corps d'Harold, son frere, fut deterre par ses ordres, decapite, jete dans un marais, puis dans la Tamise, et il exigea que le comte Godwin, principal ministre des volontes d'Harold, silt un des instruments de la vengeance exercee sur son cadavre et sur une population rebelle, Godwin cependant ne trouva pas, dans son empressement a obeir, une surete suffisante ; la clameur publique s'devait contre lui, et le designait comme l'assassin d' Alfred, frere uterin du nouveau roi ; l'archeveque d'Yorck se porta son accusateur devant Hardi-Canut.\" NOTE TVT. p. 5'6- The Trial and Acquittal of Godwine. A point to be specially noticed in this trial is the form of words which Florence, the only primary authority who records any form,"], [838, "790 APPENDIX. puts into the mouth of Godwine and his compurgators. They swear that it was not by Godwine's will or counsel that the \u00c6theling \u00c6lfred was blinded, and that, whatever Godwine did in the matter, he did at the bidding of his lord King Harold (\" Non sui consilii nee su\u00e6 voluntatis fuisse quod frater ejus c\u00e6catus fuisset, sed dominum suum regem Haroldum ilium facere quod fecit jussisse\"). This is clearly an abridged, and it is most likely an inaccurate, report of the oath really taken. It is clearly abridged, because, when Godwine by implication confessed to have done something, he could not fail to explain more at large what it was that he confessed himself to have done. But such a form of words is consistent with the view that Godwine met \u00c6lfred, or even that he arrested \u00c6lfred, within his own earldom, but that he had no hand in the barbarous cruelties which followed in a place out of his jurisdiction. But the mention of Harold as Godwine's lord again steps in to throw doubt on the whole formula. The only character in which Harold could be called Godwine's lord was that of superior lord of all Britain, in which character he was the lord rather of Harthacnut than of Godwine. Still, what ever doubts the formula may be open to, it has its worth. It points to the general likelihood that Godwine may have had a share in the events which led to the death of \u00c6lfred, and yet not a guilty share. William of Malmesbury (ii. 188), though he mentions the oath, does not give any form of words. Roger of Wendover (i. 478), seemingly following Florence, leaves out the clause in which Godwine says that he had acted by order of Harold ; \" Juravit quod neque ingenio suo nee voluntate frater ejus fuerat interemptus et oculis privates.\" This is remarkable, as Roger (i. 474) asserts the complicity of Godwine with Harold's doings perhaps more strongly than any other writer. The clause appears again in the writer called Matthew of Westminster, p. 400. I cannot resist giving some account of the grotesque legend into which the compurgation of Godwine has grown under tho hands of the so-called Bromton (X Scriptt. 937, 8). It is trans ferred to the reign of Eadward. Godwine, it will be remembered (see above, p. 786), is, at his accession, in Denmark. Meanwhile Eadward comes over to England, he is crowned, and reigns justly and mercifully. Godwine, hearing of his justice and mercy,"], [839, "THE ORIGIN OF EARL SIWARD. 791 ventures to hope that the latter princely virtue may be extended to himself, and supplicates that he may be allowed to come over and plead his cause. This he does in a \" Parliament,\" where the King with his Earls and Barons talk a large amount of Norman law. Earl Leofric at last cuts the knot ; It is clear that Godwine is guilty ; but then he is the best born man in the land after the King himself \u2014 therefore it may be presumed, neither the son of Wulfnoth the herdsman nor yet the kinsman of the upstart Ealdorman Eadric \u2014 so he and his sons, and I and eleven other nobles his kinsmen, will bring the King as much gold and silver as we each can carry, and the King shall forgive Earl Godwine and give him his lands back again. To this singular way of observing his coronation oath to do justice the saintly monarch makes no objection ; Earl Godwine takes his lands, aud King Eadward takes the broad pieces. Perhaps they were the very pieces over which he afterwards saw the devil dancing. NOTE WWW. p. 520. The Origin of Earl Siward. All that I can say of Siward (Sigeweard) is that he was most likely a Danish follower of Cnut. A Siward, seemingly the same, signs as \"minister\" in 1019 (Cod. Dipl. iv. 9) and 1032 (iv. 39). His name is also attached to a doubtful charter of Archbishop \u00c6thelnoth (iv. 53) as \" miles.\" The mythical history of Siward will be found in Langebek, iii. 288, also in the Chroniques Anglo-Normandes, ii. 104. The pedigree there given runs thus; \"Tradunt relationes antiquorum quod vir quidam nobilis, quem Dominus permisit, contra solitum ordinem human\u00e6 propaginis, ex quodam albo urso patre, muliere generosa matre, procreari, Ursus genuit Spratlingum, Spratlmgus Ulsium, Ulsius Beorn, cognomento Beresune, hoc est filius ursi.\" Beorn is Siward's father. Ulsius should of course be Ulsius, and the pedigree of course comes from Florence (see p. 423) or from the source from which Florence drew his pedigree of Ulf. But there is something especially grotesque in making Siward a son of Biorn Ulfsson, who was killed by Swegen the son of Godwine in"], [840, "792 APPENDIX. 1049. The bear who was the ancestor of Siward and Ulf had also, it would seem, known ursine descendants ; at least so I under stand the legend of Hereward, Chroniques Angl.-Norm. ii. 7. Hereward there kills a bear, \" quem incliti ursi Norweye fuisse filium . . . affirmabant . . . cujus igitur pater in silvis fertur puellam rapuisse, et ex ea Biernum regem Norweye genuisse.\" Siward, in the story, after slaying dragons and other such exploits in Orkney and Northumberland, comes to London in the reign of Eadward ; he then, under very odd circumstances, kills one Tostig, Earl of Huntingdon, and gets his earldom. The church of Saint Clement Danes (see above, p. 789) was built, we are told, to commemorate the slain followers of Tostig. This Tostig, it seems, was a Dane, who was in disfavour with King Eadward for a curious reason ; \" Rex eumdem habuit odio, quia duxerat in uxorem filiam comitis Godwini, sororem regin\u00e6.\" Afterwards, when an invasion from Norway was threatening (1045?), Siward was made Earl over Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland. The same story is found in Bromton, 945, only there \"Bernus,\" father of Siward, is himself son of the bear. Such stuff would be hardly worth mentioning, had not Sir Francis Palgrave (Engl. Comtn. ii. ccxcvii.) inferred from it the existence of an historical Tostig, Earl of Hunt ingdon. See above, p. 667. It is, I think, plain that the Tostig of this story (who is, not indeed brother, but brother-in-law of Eadward's wife Eadgyth) is meant for the son of Godwine, and that the slaying of Eadwulf by Siward has got confounded with the career of Tostig in Northumberland and his expulsion from the earldom. The one bit of history which lurks in all this seems to be the fact of the union of the earldoms of Northumberland and Huntingdon in the person of Siward. See vol. ii. Note G. NOTE XXX. p. 528. Tofig the Proud. A certain amount of interest cannot fail to attach to Tofig as Harold's forerunner in the foundation of Waltham. Of the Waltham history, \" De Inventione Sanct\u00e6 Crucis,\" I shall speak more at large when I come to Harold's time (see vol. ii. Appendix RR)."], [841, "TOFIG THE PROUD. 793 All that is known of Tofig is collected by Professor Stubbs in his edition of that tract. Nothing but local partiality could describe him as \" Tovi le Prude, qui totius Angli\u00e6 post regem primus, stallere, vexillifer regis, monarchiam gubernabat.\" (c. 7; cf. c. 14.) Professor Stubbs does not seem quite clear as to his being Staller, but he certainly was an important person. He appears in Florence as \" Danicus et pr\u00e6potens vir Tovius, Pruda cognomento.\" He signs many charters of Cnut, one of them in 1033 (Cod. Dipl. iv. 44) distinctly as \" Tovi Pruda.\" He appears also with the same surname in Cod. Dipl. iv. 54, where he is sent by Cnut on a special mission into Herefordshire to attend a Scirgemot held by Bishop \u00c6thelstan and Earl Ranig (see p. 520), the account of which, though not illustrating the life or character of Tofig, gives us one of the most living pictures of Old-English jurisprudence. Tofig's surname was needed to distinguish him from two name sakes, \"Tovi hwita\" and \" Tovi reada,\" who sign in 1024. Cod. Dipl. iv. 31. \"Tofig minister,\" who signs under Eadward in 1054 (Cod. Dipl. iv. 135), and who was Sheriff of Somerset be tween 1061 and 1066 (see Cod. Dipl. iv. 171, 197, 199), must, if the Waltham narrative be at all accurate, be a different man. In the name of Tofig's son \u00c6thelstan, as in that of Ranig's son Eadwine (see p. 520), we see an instance of the tendency among the Danish settlers under Cnut to identify themselves with England and to give their children English names. Tofig must have died soon after his marriage with Gytha (see De Inv. 14; \"Tandem consummates in brevi expleverat tempora multa, cui successit filius ejus Adelstanus\"). There is, as Professor Stubbs (pp. 1, 13) remarks, some difficulty in reconciling the chronology of the Waltham writer with re gard to the Invention of the Cross with the undoubted date of Tofig's marriage. The Waltham writer places the Invention in the time of Cnut (\" regnante Cnuto et Anglis imperante\"), that is to say seven years at the least before the time of the marriage, whereas Gytha is represented in c. 13 as already Tofig's wife and as a benefactress to the church. As Harthacnut died at the wedding, we cannot even suppose, what would otherwise be just possible, that by \"Cnutes\" we are to understand Hartha cnut The easiest explanation seems to be that gifts made by Gytha in her widowhood have been wrongly transferred to an"], [842, "794 APPENDIX. earlier date. I have elsewhere (see vol. ii. Appendix MM) thrown out a hint that this Gytha may possibly be the same as Gytha the wife of Earl Ralph of Hereford. NOTE YYY p. 530. Events after the Death of Harthacnut. The legend to which I have referred in the text has found a place in the text of Thierry (i. 179) and also in that of Mr. St. John (Four Conquests, ii. 127). According to Bromton (934) and Knighton (2326), the English, wearied with the oppressions of the Danes under Harthacnut (see above, p. 758), rose against them after his death, and drove them out by force. Knighton calls the leader of the revolt Howne, and his forces Howneher [Hunanhere]. Thierry makes Godwine the leader instead of Howne. M. de Bonnechose (Quatre Conquetes, ii. 70-2), though seeing the general absurdity of the story, admits it so far as to accept an expulsion of the housecarls. Saxo (202, 203) has a more wonderful tale than all. He has nothing to say about Howne or about Godwine. Harold, the son of Godwine, is the deliverer (\" Danic\u00e6 oppressionis simulque domestic\u00e6 libertatis auctor \"). He causes the Danish forces through out England to be invited to banquets in different places, so that they are all slain in one night. Of all this there is not a word in any trustworthy writer ; the only passage which looks at all like it is a rhetorical expression in the Life of Eadward (\" reducto diu afflictis Anglis barbarica servitute redemptionis su\u00e6 jubil\u00e6o,\" p. 394), which however most likely refers only to the extinction of the foreign dynasty and the accession of a native King. Any one who has had any experience of the growth of mythical and romantic tales will soon see what is the origin of this legend. It is plainly nothing in the world but the massacre of Saint Brice moved still further out of its place than it had already been moved by Roger of Wendover (see above, p. 652), and further mixed up with the legend of the death of \u00c6lfred, with which it is connected by both Bromton and Knighton. Knighton's \" Howne \" is clearly Roger's \" Huna \" -over again. Everything in our authentic narrative makes us believe that the election of Eadward was perfectly peaceful. A"], [843, "EVENTS AFTER THE DEATH OF HARTHACNUT. 795 general driving out or massacre of Danes is simply ridiculous ; even an expulsion of the housecarls is supported by no kind of evidence. The housecarls of Harthacnut no doubt became the housecarls of Eadward, and the saintly King, if Godwine had not been at hand to restrain him, was as ready to send them against Dover as his half-brother had been to send them against Worcester. A more marvellous version than all is to be found in the French Life of Eadward, 532-581 (Luard, pp. 40, 41). Here the Danes, after committing the usual atrocities, rebel against Harthacnut, who raises an English army against them, and, after much fighting, overcomes them. Such wild shapes did our history take when it fell into the hands of strangers. END OF VOLUME THE FIEST."], [844, ""], [845, ""], [846, ""], [847, ""], [848, ""], [849, ""], [850, ""]]
