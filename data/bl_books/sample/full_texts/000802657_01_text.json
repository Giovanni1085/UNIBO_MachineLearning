PnAE De Courcy, I am glad to see you step So lightly forward, as if half your weight Of terrors were removed. What said the nobles ? Seem they propitious to our daring hopes ? When I at first obscurely hinted them, Caution, they hung about, as fearing lest Artevelte, by semblance of a plot, designed To circumvent them ; but the lustrous eye, Beaming with hope of late emancipation From this plebeian rule, spoke what their tongues Not yet gave utterance to. This token seen, I then exposed the whole design, and who Boldly dared lend their names as leaders to it. But were you not too bold ? Ne'er was a plot More gladly met. And they are pledged to meet, When from the South the torrid orb of day Proclaims the noon. DeC. Phae. DeC. Phae. Oh, happy day arrived At length of vengeance ! Accursed Artevelte, Whose hasty passions robbed me of a father, Now shalt thou die as thou gav'st him to death !

De C, Damp.

Thus all have private wrongs to be revenged. And private longings those which mostly urge This patriot Artevelte to ambition's height, With all his feigned disinterestedness. Thus, then, a furious ardour fills each breast ; And the wild torrent of revenge bursts forth With greater force that it has grown so long, Pent up in narrow limits by despair. But now that dawning hope bursts brightly on us, Their spirits, roused ii'om dull torpidity7, Spread their wings boldly \u2014 each would be a leader, Would seize upon the post of noble Dampierre, Forgetful of all others, and that he Must strike the plume which waves to his dishonour Proudly on Artevelte's crest ; but here he comes, And what I fear to learn, I think I see Already in his thoughtful, slow deport.

But my lords, I must crave of you a promise, That if I gain his powerful influence, The post of dignity in this emprise, Be his on whom this day's success depends. Aye, madam, willingly ; but secret care Must blind the watchful eyes of Utenhove ; We have not yet dared intimate the plot To any behind the traitor's cause, Nor are they few. The guildsmen idolize him, Them most I dread : for we must make the people Active participators in the deed That reinstated my brother on the throne. He must not act in this conspiracy, Or he would be more hated than before ; The people would cry \"Artevelte was a martyr,\" When we should bid them brand their captain traitor Gerald has bent them to our purposes, Told them their liberties are staked, that he Premeditates a more despotic rule To bow these novice freemen 'neath his sway, 'Stablish his dynasty on Dampierre's fall ; And that for this he has transferred allegiance From France to England. Tell them what you will, They'll yield and raise obedient hands against him. Noble Pharailda, you who taught us when To seize this golden opportunity, And to regain our lost prosperity, By this have bound us in another debt.

Our emissaries have begun the day By making even rumour serve our cause : Their tales, by frequent repetition, gain From every mouth, and stir the people up Before our hand is manifestly shown. Nor think I that the weavers have forgot The insult which they lay to Artevelte's charge. And as the burgesses at vespers meet Their magistrates returned from Edward's court, Whose British sway Artevelte has counted for us To countenance his usurpation, Whatever be the kingly message they, If we but gain their ears, will sure reject it ; Then 'twill be ours to catch their waving spirit, Give it direction, and bid all the fury Of a blind populace bear Artevelte down.

What ! are our private wrongs, however deep, To militate against the State's well-being ? By Artevelte's means we have been blessed with peace While danger threatened round us ; and to him We owe prosperity, the joys of life, Our friends, no longer the doom'd prey of war. These joys, these friends, are they not private blessings? Then should they purchase our ignominy ? No ! rather should they stir our spirits more, Having them at his hands ! Oh now that he Stands thus surrounded by bloodthirsty foes, Unconscious of the fate awaiting him \u2014 Now all his virtues rise before me bright And glorious as day's life-giving orb, Sowing his god-created flame around, To warm a world with love of liberty, He shines, amid the grovelling herd about him, The patriot ardent in his country's cause. Daring asserter of our liberties, Whilst others groaned, oppressed by tyranny, Sole friend of virtue, honour and of Ghent, He never struck who not the blow deserved, Nor ever struck but whom the outraged laws Bade him impartially condemn.

But for awhile, Nobles of Flanders, I intreat your ear : Have not the guildmen feelings like the knights ; Does not the thing of insult, or the smart Of vengeance long restrained, make our cheeks burn, Our hearts beat restive, and our hand usurp The weighty poleaxe. Have not Ghent's proud guilds Their halls round girt with battlemented walls, Their craftsmen trained to battle's glowing rage ? And did not Artevelte, when we made him captain, Swear that he sought to aggrandise, not curb us ? Why, then, when we assailed the fullers ; why, When the armourers joined us in the fray, Did he declare all traitors to the State ; And vow to give them to a felon's death Who, stung with injuries, should dare resent them? Never will white hoods thus be swayed and taught ! Baeon. (suddenly seeing Sohier). Sohier de Courtray here! his bosom friend, Companion on the battlefield, at home, In peace and war, and yet his secret foe !

When Louis wrote, Pusillanimity, his constant fault, Inclined him to usurping Philip's will ; And thus he wrote, still deaf to our entreaties, Refusing to ally our towns to England. Made by the people captain of the State, I had maintained a strict neutrality ; But Philip dared aggress our territory. And soon, the claim of Edward to the throne Being well established, I, as bound in duty, Tender'd allegiance to our lawful prince, And left, with fifteen of our burgesses, The highest of our senate to his court, Beseeching him to enthrone the black prince, Count."], [44, "40 Uten.

The joy bells rang a merry peal. The walls, And city gates, roofs, windows, trees and tow'rs Were dressed in human faces, welcoming Me with loud plaudits ; and, as the portal fell, One shout rose, 'twas from all the assembled crowd, Swayed with a mighty burst upon the air, And oh ! the blessing reach'd me in that moment, For there thrilled through me such a proud delight That my7 ambition centred in the hope That such a shout should welcome me to Ghent. With very different sounds are you awaited ; The nobles raise the people's enmity By spreading tales that you sought England's favour To 'stablish you in more despotic sway. It grieves me much to note the disaffection Now reigning in the people's minds ; long since Incapable of unmixed freedom proved, I dreaded lest some turbulent outbreak Impelled me to reduce the sovereignty Which I had labour'd to secure to them. Oh, may I meet success in my attempts To train the men of Ghent to nobler views. It is my darling hope, my nightly dream, The subject of my anxious meditation. For thus alone our people can be blessed, Untyrannized, unshackled in their aims By imposts, nor the despot's murderous care, That paralyzes every aim of commerce.

Stand ! Ye disturbers of the State's repose ! (The Weavees simultaneously all fall back, while Aetevelte advances towards them.) & Geeaed. Amazement ! What ? On dastards, on ye knaves ! Nay ! hear me, ye unconscious suicides, And then return unto your homes in quiet ! Has zeal for Ghent, has love of liberty, Has private vengeance, or has envious hate Forced you to violate your country's laws, And urge the unlicensed steel against my breast ? Ingratitude ! my breast that heaves for you ! Unheard, nay, unaccused, does Ghent demand My death ? (Exeunt Artevelte with Weavers.) (Then the Nobles and Sohiee rushing out with swords drawn.) Confusion on you all ! (Heard from without.) That blow? Revenge de Steenbeke ! (Enter Alida and Eemangaede running with Ser- vants and torches.) My love ! oh, where is he ? (Looking in the direction of Aetevelte, and standing struck with horror.) Merciful heavens ! Oh, see ! they strike him ! Save him ! save him ! save him ! (She falls into the arms of Eemangaede.) (Enter Phaeailda with a dagger.) Oh ! what is this ? \u2014 He dead, nor I avenged ! Be thine the heart that robbed me of my vengeance, Thou flaming hell : add to his tortures all The pangs that vex my unavenged father !"], [63, "59 Eeman. Phar Eeman. Phar. Ebman, Phar, Erman. Phae. Talk not of hell ! Talk not of your revenge ! Come here\u2014 come here \u2014 and see what thou hast done ; Oh, my sweet mistress, my loved mistress, speak \u2014 Look up again ! Oh misery ! Oh grief ! And thou hast done this \u2014 thou her dearest friend \u2014 Would I had never lived to see this day ! My beauteous Alida \u2014 Nay, touch her not ! A touch so foul would agonize her soul Ere yet she gain the realm of unmixed bliss. Oh miserable ! Live ! my Alida ! Live, live, thou lovely innocent ! Oh speak ! Oh sigh ! And I have murdered thee ! Yes, yes ! And driven thee with sorrow from this world ! My cherished mistress ! How shall I survive ! She breathes ! Thank heaven ! Ah, 'tis the parting gasp, And with it flies her soul ! Pray, madam, pray ! Life trembles in the fringed veils of sight ! She lives \u2014 to bless us once more with her smiles ! She lives \u2014 but will she pardon me my fault ? Ah, cruel thoughts ! I cannot wish her life ! How will she pass her days ? In misery, In tears ; and I \u2014 shall I dare comfort her ? She's gone ! And I am left to weep away Fresh years of sorrow ! Grief gives place to grief, And memory melts these horrid thoughts in one More horrid still, to bow me with affliction ! Now, climax to my anguish, dies my friend, Life's only consolation\u2014 Spare me more ! Oh thou for whom so long I sought this hour, My father, (Pause.) For whose restless, perturbed spirit I trusted that loud masses should be sung, Thou'lt reap no boon from this ; Sohier's treachery Has robbed thy rest ; for Artevelte's friends will guide The people's rule ! Why didst thou, false sorcerer, Tell me of planets that looked down propitious ?"], [64, "60 > Mayest thou ever commune with the spirits Thou invokedst so oft ! May all the rack Of that perdition that disturbs my father Weigh upon thee ! Unsepulchred thy bones Whiten upon the sod ! Thy spirit wail Through long wove ages of unsoothed despair ! Scene 5. \u2014 Enter Sohier. Phae. Brave me not now ! Hence from my sight for ever ! If I unlov'd must wail my life away, Let not thy odious presence multiply The great amount of my too heavy sorrows ! Trembling, faint-hearted coward, how can I brook Thy hateful sight? Oh, shalt thou hover round My solitary moments, to oppress Me with remembrance of frustrated vengeance ? Sohier. Madam, your words surprise me ! What is this? I come to claim your hand ; your vengeance done ; I bring the steel all dripping with his blood, That you may gaze and gladden at the sight ! Phar. Stay there this mockery ! Deceive no more ! Did thou not swear to rescue Artevelte's life ? Did thou not invocate oblivion's shades Be spread around the memoried portraiture Of me, once loved, but hateful now to thee, Lest my reproaching eye awake remorse For thy vile treachery to me, and urge Thine arm unwillingly in my behalf? Nay, not a word 1 I've sworn to look no more With kind regard on such a double villain ! Sohier. Oh, recompense too cruel for a word Pronounc'd in secret \u2014 Phar. (interrupting Mm). Villain, what is that ? Pronounced in secret ? Do thy words belie Thy secret thoughts ? Thy thoughts are false to thee. And shame thee when thou dar'st commune with them. Didst thou for me attempt the vengeful deed ? Thy actions then belie thee as thy w7ords !"], [65, "61 No, I will tell thee ! In thy sudden rage Thou kill'dst him, anger'd by his just rebuke, That scorned the feigned protection of a man Who knew not whether he were friend or foe. Then not for me he died ; but died for thee ! Oh, villain, and thou kill'dst him when the crime Had not the warranty of virtuous hate ! Sohier. Thus dost thou recompense my too fond love ! Oh, I will treasure adders as my friends, That, when they sting me, may rebuke me thus \u2014 \" Fool that thou wast, thy woe hast thou self wrought ! \" \u2014 \u25a0 Thus pay me for my cherishing. Remorse, Oh, hast thou horrors such as these in store, As this Pharailda has awarded me For daring the eternal woes of hell To wreak her vengeance ? Then I will laugh at thee \u2014 Ha ! Ha ! Thou canst not hurt me ! Nay then, look, Pharailda, look ! I save thee the reproach Thou dreadest at my presence. Look, remorse ! Thy vultures shall not feast on me through life ! (To Phae.) Where is my sword ? Now for a blow at thee, A blow thou cravest ; a blow thou shalt repent \u2014 A blow shall save me from a rest of life That has too many terrors stored for me ! Farewell ! Remember thou hast murdered Sohier ! Scene 6. \u2014 Utenhove and Baronaige enter, followed by masses of men in armour, representing various guilds, and bearing their emblems with torches, cover the stage. The tocsin is heard throughout this scene. Utenhove catching Sohier's arm wMle he is about to stab himself. Uten. For other penalties art thou reserved, Fell monster. Bind him ! bear him to the rack ! Invent unheard-of tortures for him. Then Be careful of his life \u2014 and solitude Shall weary out the sad remains of Use,"], [66, "62 Which all remorseful conscience has prepared For bloodhounds, who will prey upon their friends ! Nay, bear him off, and rack him till he faint ! Phae. (rushing forward and throwing herself at the feet of Utenhove). Inhuman men ! Murder is satisfied ! Already dead the loveliest of the fair \u2014 Already dead, your Artevelte ! Why then more ? 'Twas I, 'twas I that murdered him ! 'Twas I ! Uten. Hence ! bear them hence, and let them wail together ! Oh, when the fury of this night is past, The bloodhounds shall lay curses at each other \u2014 'Twill be more fruitful in remorse and guilt, Shall cursing guilt increase their misery. (Exeunt several with Pharailda and Sohiee.) Scene 7. \u2014 Meanwhile the corpse of Aetevelte is laid by that of Alida. Utenhove approaches and gazes on them. Uten. Thus art thou dead ! And she who loved thee so, Beside thee lies. Her spirit rent the bonds That bound it to the earth, when thine fled hence : \u2014 She imaging Ghent's liberty's protector tried ! Yet not in death did angry7 passions mar The speaking beauty of their portraiture. See ! even now their lips are wreathed in smiles ; Their spirits hover round their yet warm clay. They mark us ! Us, friends, citizens of Ghent ! (Loud cries of all the guilds, who begin to move off the stage.) We will revenge them. Down with the traitors ! Uten. Silence, ye guildsmen ! Silence ! Crowd ye round ! And see ! Artevelte approves not your designs. From his wide wounds fall gory drops portentous ! Be here the pomp funeral of night ! (The torches are all extinguished.) Weep ! Wail ! 'Twas we, who by our turbulence, We, by our license, lawless, unrestrained, Struck Artevelte's death-blow ! Weep! He bids you thus,"], [67, "63 And not by ruthless hate revenge his fall : \u2014 Observe his laws, and they shall make you great Through centuries to come ; your license curb \u2014 Show our united front to meet the foe \u2014 Send to your suzerain, Edward, for this fault To make atonement.
