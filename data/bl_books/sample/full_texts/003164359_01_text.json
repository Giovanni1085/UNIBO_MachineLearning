The ancient Thanes of Ross could boast the greatest antiquity and splendour; and, at the period of ivhich I lurite, held the first rank amongst the Scottish nobles. Malcolm Ross, the last of that illustrious line, whose peculiar fate is the subject of the following Tragedy, ivas nepheiv to the reigning King Malcolm, by the Princess Euphemia, married to Duncan, the last Thane of Ross, and amongst the first of the ancient chiefs elevated to the dignity of Earl. This distinguished nobleman, having after wards unfortunately taken part in a casual rebellion, so common in those turbulent times, tvas overthrown and made prisoner at the battle of Huntly, and barbarously put to death by Murdoc Afac Gregor, Thane of Lochaber, King Malcolm's general and natural brother.

Their principal seats were at Dingival, in Ross-shire, and upon the banks of Lochleven, in Kinross-shire, where the ruins of their ancient castles are still to be seen.

I do remember, ere my lov'd mother died, At that dark and silent hour of night, When ghosts are said to visit them they love, She came, a pale and piteous spectre, to my bed ; Upon her damask cheek, a filthy worm Seem'd to unfold its lank and hungry length ; Which, when she mark'd, attracted my fix'd gaze, A smUe of tender pity o'erspread her face : But soon the fix'd and livid hue of death, Gave dreadful warning of mortality, And, shrieking loud and shrill, she vanished Enter Lochaber (with his sicord drawn.)
