Thou, with punctual service, fulfillest thy task, being con stant ; Thine but to ponder the Law, labour and greatly obey: Wherefore, with leapings of spirit, thou chantest the chant of the faithful, Chantest aloud at thy toil, cleansing the Earth of her stain ; Leagued in antiphonal chorus with stars and the populous Systems,"], [12, "8 HYMN TO THE SFA Following these as their feet dance to the rhyme of the Suns; Thou thyself but a billow, a ripple, a drop of that Ocean, Which, labyrinthine of arm, folding us meshed in its coil, Shall, as now, with elations, august exultations and ar- dours, Pour, in unfaltering tide, all its unanimous waves, When, from this threshold of being, these steps of the Presence, this precinct, Into the matrix of Life darkly divinely resumed, Man and his littleness perish, erased like an error and can- celled, Man and his greatness survive, lost in the greatness of God."], [13, ""], [14, ""]]
