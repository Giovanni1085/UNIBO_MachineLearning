The power by which we recall past scenes, the rapidity with which they are brought in review before us, the faculty by which we can \"range o'er creation,\" and dwell upon the past and future, demonstrates that man was indeed formed in the image of his Creator, and destined for immortality. By the contemplation of the past, we feel our span of existence extended: we enter into the thoughts, hopes, and aspirations of generations before us, and in such moments hold communion with the departed spirits of antiquity. Every thing relating to the history of the \" Pilgrim Fathers,\" is worthy of preser vation. \" The Puritans,\" says a writer in no wise partial to them, \" were the most remarkable body of men, perhaps, which the world has ever produced They were men whose minds had derived a peculiar character from the daily contemplation of superior beings and eternal interests. Not content with acknowledging in general terms an over ruling providence, they habitually ascribed every event to the will of the Great Being, for whose power nothing was too vast, for whose inspection nothing was too minute. To know him, to serve him, to enjoy him, was with them the great end of existence. They rejected with contempt, the ceremonious homage which other sects substituted for the homage osthe soul On the rich and the eloquent, on nobles and priests, they looked down wilh contempt : for they esteemed themselves rich in a more precious treasure, and eloquent in a more sublime language ; nobles by the right of an earlier creation, and priests by the imposition of a mightier hand !\" These were the men to whom the world owes the preservation of civil and religious liberty, their enemies being judges; and it was men of this stamp that were the fa thers of Connecticut. Though small in territorial extent and population, Connecticut is second to none of her sister states in the virtue, genius and enterprise of her sons. Considering the amount of her population, she has furnished a large proportion of distinguished men in almost every department of life, and some of the most powerful states in this Union are largely indebted to her for the elements of their greatness and prosperity. The early history of Connecticut, in its various parts, has been ably written by Dr. Trumbull, the venerable historian of his native state. To this work the author is deeply indebted, as he is also to the \" Gazetteer of Connecticut and Rhode Island,\" by John C. Pease and John M. Niles, Esqs., a work of much labor and merit. For the account of the towns in Middlesex County, \"Field's Statistical Account\" has fur nished much valuable information. The extracts from the most ancient newspapers were taken from files of the New Haven journals, the earliest and only copies, it is believed, that are now in existence. These journals are in the valuable library left by the late Col. William Lyon, a distinguished antiquarian, and are now in possession of his son, William Lyon, Esq. a gentleman to whom the compiler feels himself un der lasting obligations. To the various gentlemen in different parts of his native state, who have furnished information for this work, the author would here return his grate ful acknowledgments. It may be thought, perhaps, by some, that an apology ought to be made for inserting many things contained in this book : some things may be thought too trivial, others too marvelous, to be recorded. With regard to the first, it ought to be borne in mind, that many things which at the first sight may appear to us to be of little moment, may hereafter be deemed of much importance. With regard to the latter objection, it may"], [14, "IV PREFACE. be observed, that the history of any people may be considered as defective, which does not give an account of their religious belief and opinions, &c. however erroneous. Although in this age most of us may smile at what we consider the superstitions and weaknessses of our forefathers, yet it may be well to reflect that Sir Matthew Hale, Dr. Johnson, and others, men of the greatest intellect the world ever produced, lie under the same imputations. Compared wilh these men, many of those who affect to smile at their opinions are but mere children in understanding. The numerous engravings interspersed through this work, were (with five or six exceptions) executed from drawings taken on the spot, by the author of this work. Before deciding upon the correctness of these representations, he wishes his readers to consider that the appearance of any place will vary considerably as it is viewed from different points : thus, a north view will appear quite different from one taken at the south. A person not being used to see a place from the point from which the draw ing is taken, it may not at first sight be readily recognized. Before any view is con demned as being incorrect, it will be necessary, in order to form a correct judgment, to stand on the place from whence the drawing was made. In giving the notices of distinguished individuals, a limited number only could be inserted. In some instances, perhaps, the information obtained respecting some towns may have been defective. The history of some important towns may apparently not have received that attention to which they are entitled: the failure of obtaining the desired information, after the attempt was made, must be the apology. New Haven, 1837. J. W. B. Amid such a variety of facts, names and dates, it is not to be expected but that some mistakes and omissions may occur. The following is a list of all which have as yet been discovered. Glastenbury, page 93, for Hanahbuke read Kanahbukc, sometimes spelt Kanaw buck: Houksett should be Konksett, sometimes spelt Conksett. Derby, page 200, for 20 or 30 rods below the bridge, read about one mile, &c. Groton, page 309. Samuel Scabury, the first bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United Slates, was born in Pequonnuc, a small village in this town, about three or four miles eastward of New London. He graduated at Yale College in 1751. He studied theology in Scotland and in 1753 obtained orders in London. He was consecrated a bishop in Scotland, by three non-juring bishops in or about 1784; and returned to New London, where he discharged the duties of his office till his death. (See page 282.) Groton, page 309, for brother of, read uncle lo. Waterford, for Gardiner, read Gardincrs."], [15, "CONTENTS ... , Pago.

OUTLINE HISTORY. The precise time when the country now comprising Connecticut* was first visited by Europeans, cannot now be ascertained. It is probable, however, it was first visited by the Dutch, soon after they began their settlement at New Amsterdam, now New York, in 1615. Whether the Dutch at New Netherlands, or the people at New Plymouth, first discovered the river Connecticut, it is not now known. Both the Dutch and English claimed to be the first discoverers, and both purchased and made a settlement of the lands upon it nearly at the same time. In 1633, William Holmes and others of the Plymouth colonists, having prepared the frame and other materials for erecting a house, put them on board a vessel and sailed for Connecticut. When he came into the river, he found that the Dutch had got in before him, proceeded up the river, made a light fort, and planted two pieces of cannon on Dutch Point in Hartford. Although the Dutch threatened to fire upon him, Holmes proceeded up the river, landed on the west side of the Con necticut, near the mouth of the little river in Windsor. Here he erected his house, and fortified it, being it is said the first house erected in Con necticut. In 1635, a number of people from Massachusetts came into Con necticut, and made preparations for settlements at Windsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield. In October of the same year, about sixty men, women and children, came through the wilderness from Massachusetts to Connecticut river, and arrived at the places of their destination on the 9th of November,! after a journey of fourteen days. In Novem ber, Mr. John Winthrop, who had a commission from Lord Say and Seal, Lord Brook and others, sent a party of twenty men, in a small ves sel of about 30 tons, from Massachusetts, took possession of the mouth of the Connecticut, and thus prevented the Dutch from ascending the river. The first court in Connecticut was holden at Hartford, April 26th, 1636. It consisted of Roger Ludlow, Esq., Mr. John Steel, Mr. Wm. Swaim, Mr. Wm. Phelps, Mr. Wm. Westwood, and Mr. Andrew Ward. Mr. Ludlow had, in 1631, been chosen lieutenant governor of Massa- * Connecticut derives its name from the river by which it is intersected, called by the natives Qnoneklacut; (Hovt's Indian Wars, &c. p. 37.) This word, according to some, signifies the long river ; it has, however, been stated by others, that the mean ing of the word is, River of Pines, in allusion to the forests of pines that formerly stood on its banks. t Dr. Hawes' Centennial Address, 1835. 2"], [22, "10 OUTLINE HISTORY. chusetts colony. The Connecticut planters at first settled under the general government of Massachusetts, but they held courts of their own, which consisted of two principal men from each town. On great occa sions, these were joined with committees, (as they were called,) con sisting of three men from each town. These courts had the power of transacting the common affairs of the colony ; they also had the power of making war and peace, and forming alliances with the natives within the colony.* There were three courts held in 1636 ; the principal business done in them related principally to their military affairs, as \" their circum stances were such, that it was judged necessary for every man to be a soldier.\" The first court was held in Hartford, as has been related ; the second was holden at Windsor, June 7th ; the third at Wethersfield, on the 1st of September. In the month of June, 1636, Messrs. Hooker and Stone, with their company, came through the wilderness to Hartford. There were, at the close of this year, says Dr. Trumbull, about two hundred and fifty men in the three towns on the river, and there were twenty men in the garrison at the entrance of it, under the command of Lieut. Gardiner. The whole consisted, probably, of about 800 persons, or of one hundred and sixty or seventy families. The year 1637 is memorable in tbe history of Connecticut, on ac count of the Pequot war and the destruction of that warlike tribe. In the year 1634 a number of Indians, in confederacy with the Pequots, murdered Capt. Stone and Capt. Norton, with the whole of their crew, consisting of eight men, and plundered and sunk the vessel. Captain Stone was from the West Indies, and came into Connecticut river, with a view of trading at the Dutch House. In 1636, Capt. Oldham was killed at Block Island, where he went to trade : several osthe murder ers fled to the Pequots and were protected by them, and were there fore considered as the abettors of the murder. The murder of Capt. Oldham induced Massachusetts to send ninety men, under Capt. Endicott, to reduce the Indians on Block Island, and then to demand of the Pequots the murderers of Capt. Stone and his crew, and a thousand fathoms of wampum for damages, and a number of their children as hostages. Capt. Endicott sailed from Boston Aug. 25th, and landed on the island, but the Indians secreted themselves in swamps and other places, where they could not be found. He however destroyed about sixty wigwams, and about 200 acres of corn. The party then sailed to Pequot, now New London harbor, and demanded satisfaction for the murders they had committed. In a few hours, nearly three hundred Pequots collected upon the shore, but after havirjof stilly learned the object of the visit they withdrew, and instead of treating with the English, they shot their arrows at them. He landed his men on both sides of the harbor, burnt their wigwams, and killed one or two Indians. This expedition gave great dissatisfaction to the Connecticut settlers, as nothing had been done to subdue, but enough to exasperate a haughty and warlike enemy. * Dr. Trumbull."], [23, "OUTLINE HISTORY. 11 The Pequot prince Sassacus and his captains were men of haughty and independent spirits ; they had conquered and governed the Indian tribes around them without control. They viewed the English as in truders, and they were determined to extirpate, or drive them from the country. For this purpose they endeavored to unite the Indians against them : they spared no pains to make peace with the Narragansetts, and to engage them against the English. The governor of Massachusetts, to prevent a union between these tribes, sent for Miantonimoh, their chief sachem, with some other chief men of the nation, who came to Boston, and made a treaty of peace with the English. The Pequots continued hostile during the year 1636, and killed a number of persons in various places, and during a greater part of the win ter following kept the fort at Saybrook in a state of siege. When the spring came on, they became still more troublesome. They waylaid the roads and fields, and kept the whole colony in a state of alarm. The settlers could neither hunt, fish or cultivate their fields, but at the peril of their lives, and their prospects were dark and gloomy in the extreme. In this important crisis, a court was summoned at Hartford, on Monday the 1st of May. As they were to deliberate on matters which concerned the very existence of the colony, the towns for the first time sent committees. The magistrates were Roger Ludlow, Esq. Messrs. Wells, Swaim, Steel, Phelps, and Ward. The committees were Messrs. Whiting, Webster, Williams, Hull, Chaplin, Talcott, Geffbrds, Mitchell, and Sherman. The court, considering that the Pequots had killed nearly thirty of the English, determined that offensive war should be im.mediately carried on against them. For this purpose they voted that 90 men should be raised forthwith ; 42 from Hartford, 30 from Windsor, and 18 from Wethersfield. The report of the murders committed by the Pequots, roused the other colonies to spirited exertions against the common enemy. Mas sachusetts determined to send 200, and Plymouth 40 men, to aid Con necticut in prosecuting the war. Capt. Patrick, with 40 men, was sent forward before the other troops from Massachuselts and Plymouth could be ready to march, in order to make a junction with the soldiers from Connecticut. On Wednesday the 10th of May, 1637, the troops of Connecticut fell down the river to Saybrook, on board a pink, a pinnace, and a shal lop. Their force consisted of 90 Englishmen, commanded by Capt. John Mason, and accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Stone as chaplain. They were also accompanied by Uncas, sachem of the Mohegans with about 70 friendly Indians. The troops arrived at Saybrook fort on Monday the 15th. As there was some delay in passing down the river, the Indians desired to be set on shore, promising to join the English at Saybrook. On their way they fell in with about 40 of the enemy, near the fort, killed seven and took one prisoner, whom they put to death in the most barbarous manner. On the 19th of May, Capt. Mason sailed for the Narragansett country, where he arrived the next day. Being joined by 200 Narragansetts, he proceeded to the Pequot country, and on the 26th of May attacked the Pequot fort by surprise. This fort"], [24, "12 OUTLINE HISTORY. was situated in the present town of Groton. The reader is referred to the history of that town, for an account of the destruction of the fort and the events which followed. The following address to the soldiers who were engaged in the ex pedition against the Pequots, is generally ascribed to the Rev. Mr. Hooker. Be this as it may, it is a valuable specimen osthe eloquence osthe times, and worthy of preservation. It is found in the \" Wonder working Providence of Zion's Saviour in New England,\" printed in London, in 1658: the following is copied from that work, the orthog raphy being retained. The narrator says \u2014 \"the souldiers arriving in safety at the towne of Hartford, were encouraged by the reverend min isters there with some such speech as followes.\" \" Fellow-souldiers, Country-men, and Companions in this wildernesse worke, who are gathered together this day by the inevitable providence of the great Jehovah, not in a tumultuous manner, hurried on by the floating fancy of every high hot-headed braine, whose actions prove abortive, or if any fruit brought forth, it hath beene rape, theft, and murther, things inconsisling with nature's light, then much lesse with a Souldier's valour; but you, my deare hearts, puiposely piekt out by the godly grave Fathers of this government, that your prowesse may carry on the work, where there justice in her righteous course is obstructed, you need not question your authority to execute those whom God, the righteous judge ot all the world, hath condemned for blaspheming his sacred Majesty, and murthering his Servants: every common Soul dier among you is now installed a Magistrate ; then shew yourselves men of cour age: I would not draw low the height of your enemies' hatred against you, and so debase your valour. This you may expect, their swelling pride hath laid the found ation of large conceptions against you and all the people ot Christ in this wildernesse, even as wide as Babel's bottome. But, my brave Souldiers, it hath mounted already to the clouds, and therefore it is ripe for confusion-, also their erueltie is famously knowne, yet all true bred Souldiers reserve this as a common maxime, cruelty and cowardice are unseparable companions; and in briefe, there is nothing wanting on your enemies' part, that may deprive you of a compleat victory, onely their nimble ness of foot, and the unaccessible swamps and nut tree woods, forth of which your small numbers may intice, and industry compell them. And now to you I put the question, who would not sight in such a cause wilh an agile spirit, and undaunted boldnesse ? Yet if you look for further encouragement, I have it for you; riches and honor are the next to a good cause eyed by every Souldier, to maintain your owne, and spoile your enemies of theirs; although gold and silver be wanting to either of you, yet have you lhat to maintaine which is farre more precious, the lives, libcriyes, and new purchased freedomes, priviledges,' and immunities of the indeared servants of our Lord Christ Jesus, and of your second selves, even your affectionated bosome mates, together wilh the chief'e pledges of your love, the comforting contents of harm lesse pratling and smiling babes; and in a word, all the riches of that goodnesse and mercy that attends the people of God in the injoyment of Christ, in his ordinances, even in this life; and as for honour, David was not to be blamed for enquring after it, as a due recompence of that true valourthe Lord had bestowed on him : and now the Lord hath prepared this honour for you, oh you couragious Souldiers of his, to execute vengeance upon Ihe heathen, and correction among the people, to binde their Kings in chaines and Nobles in setters of Iron, that they may execute upon them the judgments that are written ! this honour shall be to all his Saints, but some of you may suppose death's stroke may cut you short of this: let every faithful Souldier of Christ Jesus know, that the cause why some of his endeared Servants are taken away by death in a just warre (as this assuredly is) it is not because they should fall short of the honours accompanying such noble designes, but rather because earth's honours are two scant for them, aud therefore the everlasting Crown must be set upon iheir heads forthwith, then march on with a cheersull Christian courage in ihe strength of the Lord, and the power of his might, who will forthwith inclose your enemies in your hands, make their multitude fall under your warlike weapons, and your feet 6hall soon be set on their proud necks.\" The Pequot war, though so signally successful, was severely felt by the inhabitants ; the consequence was a scarcity and debt, which it was"], [25, "OUTLINE HISTORY. 13 extremely difficult to pay. The Court were obliged to impose a tax of \u00a3550, to be immediately collected, to defray the expenses of the war. This appears to have been the first public tax in Connecticut. As the inhabitants were much distressed by the want of corn, a com mittee was sent to an Indian settlement called Potomcock, since Deer field, where they purchased such quantities, that the Indians came down to Windsor and Hartford with fifty canoes at one time.* This was con sidered as a great deliverance by pious people at that period. The pursuit of the Pequots to the westward led to an acquaintance with the lands on the sea-coast, from Saybrook to Fairfield. It was reported to be a very sine country. This favorable report induced Mr. Eaton, Mr. Hopkins, the Rev. Mr. Davenport, and others, who emi grated from London to Massachusetts, in 1637, to think of this part of the country as the place of their settlement. Their friends in Massa chusetts, extremely unwilling to part with a company of such respecta bility, endeavored to dissuade them from their purpose. Influenced, however, by the inviting prospects which the country promised, and flattering themselves that they should he out of the jurisdiction of the other colonies, and that they should be able to form such a government as would be most agreeable to them, they determined to proceed. Ac cordingly, on the 30th of March, 1638, they sailed from Boston for Quinnipiac, now New Haven, and laid the foundation of a flourishing colony. The inhabitants of Hartford, Windsor and Wethersfield, finding them selves without the limits of the Massachusetts patent, formed themselves into a distinct commonwealth. On the 14th of January, 1639, all the free planters convened at Hartford, and adopted a constitution of civil government. The following is the preamble and constitution adopted at this time. \"Fsorasmuch as it hath pleased the Almighty God, by the wise disposition of his divine providence, so to order and dispose of things, that we the Inhabitants and resi dents of Windsor, Hartford and Weathersseild, are now cohabiting, and dwelling in and uppon the river os Conneticutt, and the lands thereto adjoining, and well know ing when a people are gathered together, the word of God requires, lhat to meinteine the peace and union of such a people, there should bee an orderly and decent governe ment established according to God, to order and dispose of the affaires of the people at all seasons as occassion shall require; doe therefore associate and conjoine our selves to bee as one publique State or Commonwealth; and doe for ourselves and our successors, and such as shall bee adjoined to us at any time hereafter enter into combination and confederation together, to meinteine and preserve ihe libberty and purity of the Gospell of our Lord Jesus, which we now profess, as also the discipline of the churches, which, according to the truth of the said Gospell, is now practised amongst us; as allso in ourcivill affaires to be guided and governed according to such lawes, rules, orders, and decrees, as shall bee made, ordered, and decreed, as followeth : \" I.

This Constitution was copied from the original records in the Secretary of State's office: the ancient orthography is retained. For this, the author is indebted to a compilation of the earliest laws, &c. in Connecticut, published by Mr. Audrus of Hartford in 1830,"], [28, "16 OUTLINE HISTORY. \" Fsorasmuch as the free fruition of such libberties, immunities, priviledges, as hu manity, civility and Christianity call for, as due to every man in bis place and pro portion, without impeachment and infringement, halh ever beene and ever will bee the tranquillity and stabilliiy of Churches\" and Commonwealths; and the denyall or deprivall thereof, the disturbance, if not mine of both: , \" 12.

Agreeable to the Constitution, the freemen convened at Hartford on the second Thursday in April, 1639, and elected their officers for the year ensuing. John Haynes, Esq. was chosen Governor ; Roger Lud low, George Wyllys, Edward Hopkins, Thomas Welles, John Webster, and William Phelps, Esquires, were chosen Magistrates. Mr. Ludlow, the first of the six magistrates, was Deputy Governor. Mr. Hopkins was chosen Secretary, and Mr. Welles, Treasurer. The names of the deputies sent to this first general assembly, were Mr. John Steele, Mr. Spencer, Mr. John Pratt, Mr. Edward Stebbins, Mr. Gaylord, Mr. Henry Wolcott, Mr. Stoughton, Mr. Ford, Mr. Thurston Rayner, Mr. James Boosy, Mr. George Hubbard, and Mr. Richard Crab. This year, an adjourned General Assembly incorporated the several towns in the colony, and vested them with power to transact their own affairs. It was enacted, that they should choose, from among them selves, three, five, or seven men, to be a court for each town. This court was appointed to sit once in two months, and determine all mat ters of trespass or debt not exceeding forty shillings. It was also or dained that every town should keep a public ledger, in which deeds, mortgages, &.c. should be put on record. This was the origin of town privileges in Connecticut. Besides the courts in each town, there was a court of magistrates which held its session once in three months. This court appeared to possess all the authority and did all the business, which is now performed by the County and Superior Courts. In 1642, the capital laws of Connecticut were nearly completed and put on record. The several passages on which they were sounded, were particularly noticed in the statute. They were twelve in number ; two more were added at a subsequent period. The following is a copy of these laws, excepting four which relate to unchastity.. \"CAPITALL LAWES. \" 1.

Deut. 21.20, 21.\" In 1643, the colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven, united into a confederacy, for their own mutual safety and welfare, and called themselves the \" United Colonies of New Eng land.\" Each colony was authorized to send two commissioners, to meet annually in September, first at Boston, then at Hartford, New Haven, and Plymouth. The commissioners were vested with plenary powers for making war and peace, and rules of general concern ; espe cially, to regulate the conduct of the inhabitants towards the Indians, for the general defense of the country, and for the support and encour agement of religion. This union was of much importance to tbe New England colonies. It made them formidable to the Dutch and Indians, and it was one of the principal means of their preservation during the unsettled state and civil wars of the mother country. At the General Court in April, 1644, a committee was appointed, consisting of the governor, deputy governor, and several others, to treat with George Fenwick, Esq. relative to the purchase of Saybrook fort, and all the buildings and lands in the colony which he, and the lords and gentlemen interested in the patent of Connecticut, might claim. The negociation was successful, and the colony, in the whole, paid Mr. Fenwick \u00a31,600 sterling, merely for the jurisdiction right, or for the old patent of Connecticut. About this period, tobacco was coming into use in the colony ; the fol lowing curious law was made for its regulation or suppression. \"TOBACKO. \"Fforasmuch as it is observed, lhat many abuses are crept in, and committed, by fre quent taking of tobacko: \"It is ordered by the authority of this Courte, That no person under the age of twenty one years, nor any other, that hath not already accustomed himselfe to the use thereof, shall take any tobacko, unlill hee hath brought a certificate under the hands of some who are approved for knowledge and skill in phisick, that it is useful! for him, and allso, that he hath received a lycense from the courte, for the same. \u2014 And for the regulating of those, who either by theire former taking it, have to theire own appre hensions, made it necessary to them, or upon due advice, are persuaded to the use thereof: \"It is ordered, That no man within this colonye, after the publication hereof, shall take any tobacko, publiquely, in the streets, highwayes, or any barne yards, or uppon training dayes, in any open places, under the penalty of six-pence for each offence 3"], [30, "18 OUTLINE HISTORY. against this order, in any the perticulars thereof, to bee paid without gainesaying, up pon conviction, by the testimony of one witness, that is without just exception, belore any one magistrate. And the constables in the severall townes, are required to make presentment to each perticular courte, of such as they doe understand, and can evict lo bee transgressors of this order.\" Until the year 1648, the governors and magistrates appear to have served the people for the honor of it, and the public good. The gen eral court granted the governor \u00a330 annually. The same sum was granted to the deputy governor, who had presided the preceding year. These appear to have been the first salaries given to any civil officers in the colony, and to have been a compensation for the expense of the office, rather than for compensation for the service performed. Mr. Ludlow had been desired, by the General Court, for several years successively, to make a collection of laws which had been enacted, and to revise and prepare a body of laws for the colony. In the year 1649, he finished the work, and a code was established at the session of the Assembly. Until this period, punishments, being left at the discretion of the courts, in many instances had been uncertain and arbitrary. In 1946, one Bartlett, for defamation, was sentenced to stand in the pillory during the public lecture, then to be whipped, pay \u00a35, and suffer six months imprisonment. In the same year, one Turner, for the same crime, was sentenced to be whipped, and then imprisoned a month ; at the month's end to go to the post again, and then to be bound for his good behavior. For violation of the Sabbath, there is an instance of imprisonment during the pleasure of the court. Unchastity between single persons was sometimes punished by setting the delinquent in the pillory, and by whipping him from one town to another. In 1653, such were the injuries which had been sustained from the Dutch at New Netherlands, and their plotting and inciting the Indians against the English, that it was a year of great distress and alarm. The colonies of Connecticut and New Haven provided a frigate of ten or twelve guns, with forty men, to defend the coast against the Dutch, and to prevent Ninigrate and his Indians from crossing the Sound, in prose cution of his hostile designs against the Indians in alliance with the col onies. In the following year, 1654, the colony having received an or der from Parliament to treat the Dutch as declared enemies, the Dutch house and lands at Hartford were seized for the benefit osthe common wealth. In 1655, Governor Eaton finished the compilation of a code of laws for the New Haven colony. For his assistance, he was requested, by the General Court, to consult the Rev. Mr. Cotton's discourse on civil government in a new plantation, and the laws of Massachusetts. The laws having been examined and approved by the elders of the jurisdic tion, they were presented to the General Court. They ordered that five hundred copies should be printed. The copy was sent to Eng land to be printed, under the inspection of Gov. Hopkins. \" He pro cured the printing of the laws at his own expense, and sent the number proposed, with some other valuable books, as a present. The laws were distributed to the several towns in the jurisdiction.\""], [31, "OUTLINE HISTORY. 19 In 1661, Governor Winthrop of Connecticut was appointed agent of the colony, to go to England and present a petition to King Charles II. for the purpose of obtaining a patent. The governor was a man of address, and he arrived in England at a happy time for Connecticut. Lord Say and Seal, the great friend of the colony, had been particu larly instrumental in restoring Charles to the throne of his father, and was now in high favor at court. The earl of Manchesler, another friend of the puritans, was chamberlain of his majesty's household. Mr. Win throp had an extraordinary ring, which had been given his grandfather by King Charles I. which he presented to the king. This, it is said, exceedingly pleased his majesty, as it had been once the property of a father most dear to him. Under all these favorable circumstances, the petition ofConnecticut was presented, and was received with uncommon grace and favor. Upon the 20th of April, 1662, his majesty granted the colony his letters patent, conveying the most ample priviliges, under the great seal of England. The colony of New Haven was by the charter included within the limits of Connecticut. This gave great dissatisfaction to most of the inhabitants of New Haven colony. Their ministers and churches were universally against being united with Connecticut. Mr. Davenport and others of the colony were strong in the opinion, that all government should be in the church. No person in this colony could be a freeman unless he was a member of the church in full communion. But in Con necticut, all orderly persons, possessing a freehold to a certain amount, might be free of the corporation. The New Haven people were un doubtedly fearful that an unoin with Connecticut would mar the purity and order of their churches, and have a bad effect on the civil adminis trations. It was also a painful reflection, that after they had been at so much pains and expense to form a distinct commonwealth, that their existence as a separate people should cease, and their name be obliter ated. After considerable trouble and difficulty, the two colonies of Connecticut and New Haven, at the general election, May 11th, 1655, united in one, and John Winthrop, Esq. was chosen governor. On March 12th, 1664, King Charles II. gave a patent to his brother, the Duke of York and Albany, of several extensive tracts of land in North America, in which the lands on the west side of Connecticut river were included. After granting the patent, an armament was sent from England, under Colonel Richard Nichols, for the reduction osthe Dutch possessions in America. Col. Nichols had a commission, not only for this purpose, hut also for hearing and determining all matters of complaint and controversy between the New England colonies. Af ter Col. Nichols had subdued New Netherlands, and given it its pres ent name, New York, he, with his associates, appointed by the Crown, met with the agents appointed by Connecticut, and on the 30th of No vember, 1664, determined that the western boundary of Connecticut should be a line beginning on the east side of Momoronock creek or river, at the place where the salt water meets the fresh, at high water, and thence north northwest to the line of Massachusetts. The com missioners also determined the southern bounds of the colony of Con-"], [32, "20 OUTLINE HISTORY. necticut to be the sea. By this decision, Connecticut lost all her pos sessions on Long Island. The granting of such extraordinary powers to Col. Nichols and his associates, awakened in the colonies a serious apprehension for their liberties. Upon the pacification of the Dutch, the Duke of York took out a new patent from the king, dated June 29th, 1674, granting the same territory described in a former patent. Immediately after, he commis sioned Major, afterwards Sir Edmund Andross, to be governor of New York and all his territories in these parts. Andross was a mere tool of the Duke, and a tyrant of the people. By virtue of the patent to the Duke of York, he laid claim to the lands on the west side of Connecti cut river, notwithstanding the priority of the patent of Connecticut, and in violation of the agreement of 1664. To enforce his claims, he attempted in 1675 to take the fort at Saybrook ; lie was however de feated in this attempt, by the firmness and resolution of Capt. Bull. In 1675, Philip, sachem of the Wampanogas, began the most de structive war ever waged by the Indians upon the infant colonies. Lest he should increase his power by an alliance with the Narragansetts, the English made a friendly treaty with them in July, 1675. But notwith standing this, in December osthe same year, it was discovered that they were secretly aiding Phhilip's party. This determined the English to undertake a winter expedition against them. For this object the colo ny of Massachusetts furnished five hundred and twenty seven men, Plymouth one hundred and fifty nine, and Connecticut three hundred ; to all these were attached one hundred and fifty Mohegan Indians. After electing Josiah Winslow, governor of Plymouth colony, to be their commander, the whole party met at Pettyquamsquot. About sixteen miles from this place, it was found that the Narragansetts had built a strong fort in the midst of a large swamp, upon a piece of dry land of about five or six acres. The fort was a circle of pallisadoes, surrounded by a fence of trees, which was about one rod thick. On the 19th of December, 1675, at dawn of day, the English took up their march through a deep snow, and at 4 o'clock in the afternoon attacked the Indians in their fortress. The only entrance which ap peared practicable, was over a log or tree, which lay up five or six feet from the ground, and this opening was commanded by a sort of block house in front. The Massachusetts men, led on by their captains, first rushed into the fort, but the enemy, from the block-house and other places opened so furious a fire upon them, that they were obliged to retreat. Many men were killed in this assault, and among them5 Cap tains Johnson and Davenport. The whole army then made a united onset. The conflict was terrible, some of the bravest captains fell, and victory seemed very doubtful. At this crisis, some of the Connecticut men ran to the opposite side of the fort, where there were no pallisa does ; they sprang in, and opened a brisk and well directed fire upon the backs of the enemy. This decided the contest. The Indians were driven from the block-house, and from one covert to another, until they were wholly destroyed or dispersed in the wilderness. As they retreat ed, the soldiers set fire to their wigwams, (about six hundred in num.-"], [33, "OUTLINE HISTORY. 21 ber,) which were consumed by the flames. In this action it was com puted that about seven hundred fighting Indians perished, and among them twenty of their chiefs. Three hundred more died from their wounds \u2014 to these numbers may be added many old men, women and children, who had retired to this fort as a place of undoubted security. \" Of the three hundred Englishmen from Connecticut, eighty were killed and wounded, twenty in Captain Seely's, twenty in Captain Gal lop's seventeen in Captain Watt's, nine in Captain Mason's, and four teen in Captain Marshall's company. Of these about forty were killed or died of their wounds. About half the loss, in this bloody action fell upon Connecticut. The legislature of the colony, in a representa tion osthe services they had performed in the war, say ' In that signal service, the fort fight, in Narragansett, as we had our full number, in pro portion with the other confederates, so all say they did their full propor tion of service. Three noble soldiers, Seely, courageous Marshall, and bold Gallop, died in the bed of honor; and valiant Mason, a fourth cap tain, had his death's wound. There died many brave officers and sen tinels, whose memory is blessed, and whose death redeemed our lives. The bitter cold, the tarled swamp, the tedious march, the stong fort, the numerous and stubborn enemy they contended with, for their God, king, and country, be their trophies over death. He that commanded our forces then, and now us, made no less than seventeen fair shots at the enemy, and was thereby as oft a fair mark for them. Our mourn ers, over all the colony, witness for our men, that they were not un faithful in that day.' It is the tradition, that Major, afterwards Gover nor Treat, received a ball through the brim of his hat ; that he was the last man who left the fort, in the dusk osthe evening, commanding the rear osthe army. The burning of the wigwams, the shrieks and cries osthe women and children, and the yelling osthe warriors, exhibited a most horrible and afFecting scene, so that it greatly moved some of the soldiers. They were in much doubt then, and afterwards often serious ly enquired, whether burning their enemies alive could be consistent with humanity, and the benevolent principles osthe gospel.\"* In 1685, Charles II. died, and was succeeded by the Duke of York, who took the title of James II. The latter part osthe reign of Charles had been distinguished by an oppression of his subjects. He lightly regarded the charters which he had at different times granted, and tri fled with the rights, property and liberty of his subjects. The op pression of Charles was increased rather than diminished by James, who was a tyrant and a bigoted Catholic. It was the object of those in power at that time, to procure a surrender of all the patents of the colonies, and form the whole northern part of America into twelve provinces, with a governor general over the whole. In July, 1685, a quo warranto was issued against the governor and company of Connecticut, requiring their appearance before him, within eight days of St. Martin's, to show by what warrant they exercised cer tain powers and privileges. In July, 1686, the Assembly osthe colony * Trnmbull's History of Connecticut."], [34, "22 OUTLINE HISTORY. agreed upon an address to his majesty, in which they in the most sup pliant terms besought him to recall the writ against them, entreated his pardon for any faults in their government, and humbly requested the continuance of their charter. On the 21st of the same month, two writs of quo warranto were delivered to Governor Treat. They were brought over by Edward Randolph, a noted enemy of the colonies. The time of appearance before his majesty was past before the writs arrived. On the 23th of December, another writ of quo warranto was served on the governor and company, bearing date Oct. 23d, requiring their appearance before his majesty, within eight days of the Purifica tion of the Blessed Virgin. Though these writs gave no proper time for the appearance of the colony, yet they declared all its chartered rights vacated, upon its not appearing at time and place. When the writs of quo warranto arrived in 1686, the governor con voked a special Assembly, on the 28th of July. Mr. Whiting was ap pointed the agent of Connecticut, to present their petition and use every effort for the preservation of their chartered rights. Mr. Whiting, how ever, found his utmost efforts to be in vain ; the king and council had determined to vacate all the charters, and unite all the colonies to the crown, under a governor of royal appointment. Sir Edmund Andross was appointed the first governor general over New England, and arrived at Boston, Dec. 19th, 1686. He immediately wrote to the governor and company of Connecticut, to resign their charter, but without suc cess. In October, 1687, Andross with a company of soldiers arrived at Hartford, while the Assembly was in session, and demanded a sur render of their charter. The charter was produced, and while the offi cers of the government were debating with Andross on the subject, the lights were suddenly extinguished, and the charter was seized and se creted in a hollow oak. Andross, hewever, proceeded to take formal possession of the government, annexed it to Massachusetts and ap pointed officers, civil and military. Andross began his government with the most flattering professions of regard to the happiness and welfare osthe people. But he soon threw off the mask, and exercised arbitrary and despotic power, in the most unlimited manner. As all the charter governments were either vacated or suspended, it was declared that the title osthe colonists to ther lands was of no value. Andross declared that Indian deeds were no better than \" the scratch of a bear's paw.\" The proprietors of lands, after fifty and sixty years' improvement osthe soil, were obliged in many in stances to take out new patents for their estates, for which a heavy fee was demanded. This, with numerous other proceedings, equally arbi trary, made the people indeed to feel the weight of oppression. Hap pily the reign osthe \" tyrant of New England,\" was of short duration. King James, his royal master, had rendered himself so odious in Eng land, that he was obliged to flee from the kingdom. William, Prince of Orange, landed in England, Nov. 5th, 168S, and delivered' the na tion. Upon the news of the revolution, on the 18th of April, 1C89, the inhabitants of Boston and its vicinity rose in arms, made themselves masters of the Castle, arrested Sir Edmund Andross and his council,"], [35, "OUTLINE HISTORY. 23 and persuaded the old governor and council to resume the government. Connecticut obtained, from the most able lawyers in England, an opin ion that the colony, not having surrendered the charter under seal, and no judgment being entered on record, the charter was not invalidated; the former government was, therefore, re-established. About this period, great complaints were made in England, against the colonies, for harboring pirates ; and that no laws had been made against them. A letter had been written to the governor and company by Lyonel Jenkins, Esq. complaining of this neglect, and demanding in his majesty's name that a law should forthwith be made against pi racy. A special Assembly was consequently called, on the 5th of July, 1684, and a law enacted against it, and a copy of it immediately for warded to his majesty's secretary of state.* In August, 1692, Col. Benjamin Fletcher, governor of New York, arrived at the seat of his appointment, having a commission authorizing him to take command of the militia of Connecticut and the neighboring colonies. As this power was expressly given to the colony of Con- * The memory of that noted pirate, Capt. Kidd, is still held in remembrance in all parts of Connecticut, from the belief by some that he buried large sums of money on the coast or near the banks of rivers. The following circumstantial account of Kidd's visit to Gardiner's Island was recently communicated to the author of this work, by John G. Gardiner, Esq. of Gardiner's Island. \"We have,\" says Mr. Gardiner, \" a small piece, a sample of cloth of gold, which my father received from Mrs. Wetmore, mother of the wife of Capt. Mather, (com mander of the Revenue Cutter,) New London. I send you an extract from her letter, giving an account of Capt. Kidd's living on this island.\" \" I remember when very young, hearing my mother say that her grandmother was wife to Lord Gardiner when the pirate (Kidd) came to Gardiner's Island. The Cap tain wanted Mrs. Gardiner to roast him a pig; she being afraid to refuse him, cooked it very nice, and he was much pleased with it ; he then made her a present of this silk, which she gave to her two daughters. Where the olher went or whether it is in being I know not \u2014 but this was handed down to me; it has been kept very nice, and I believe is now as good as when first given, which must be upwards of a hundred years,\" &c. &c.

The colony also sent William Pitkin, Esq. to New York, to endeavor to make terms with Governor Fletcher respecting the militia, until his majesty's pleas ure should be further known. No terms, however, could be made, short of an entire submission of the militia to his command. \" On the 26th of October, he came to Hartford, while the Assembly were sitting, and, in his majesty's name demanded their submission of the militia to his command, as they would answer it to his majesty ; and that they would give him a speedy answer in two words, yes, or no. He subscribed himself his majesty's lieutenant and commander in chief of the militia, and of all the forces by sea or land, and of all the forts and places of strength in the colony of Connecticut.* He ordered the militia of Hartford under arms, that he might beat up for volunteers. It was judged expedient to call the train bands in Hartford together; but the Assembly insisted, that the command of the militia was expressly vested, by charter, in the governor and company ; and that they could by no means, consistently with their just rights and the common safety, resign it into any other hands. They insinuated, that his demands were an invasion of their essential privileges, and subversive of their constitution. \"Upon this, Colonel Bayard, by his excellency's command, sent a letter into the Assembly, declaring, that his excellency had no design upon the civil rights of the colony; but would leave them, in all re spects as he found them. In the name of his excellency, he tendered a commission to Governor Treat, empowering him to command the mi litia of the colony. He declared, that his excellency insisted, that they should acknowledge it an essential right inherent in his majesty to com mand the militia ; and that he was determined not to set his foot out of the colony until he had seen his majesty's commission obeyed : That he would issue his proclamation, showing the means he had taken to \"Capt.

Captain Wadsworth instantly commanded, \" Beat the drums;\" and there was such a roaring of them that nothing else could be heard. Colonel Fletcher commanded silence. But no sooner had Bayard made an attempt to read again, than Wads worth commands, \" Drum, drum, I say.\" The drummers understood their business, and instantly beat up with all the art and life of which they were masters. \" Silence, silence,\" says the Colonel. No sooner was there a pause, than Wadsworth speaks with great earnestness, \" Drum, drum, I say ;\" and turning to his excellency, said, \" If I am interrupted again I will make the sun shine through you in a moment.\" He spoke with such energy in his voice and meaning in his countenance, that no further attempts were made to read or enlist men. Such num bers of people collected together, and their spirits appeared so high, that the governor and his suite judged it expedient, soon to leave the town and return to New York.\"f Gen. Winthrop having arrived in England, presented the petition to his majesty. \" His majesty's attorney and solicitor-general gave their opinion in favor of Connecticut's commanding the militia ; and on the 19th of April, 1694, his majesty in council determined according to the report they had made.\" As it was a time of war with the French, the quota of Connecticut was fixed at one hundred and twenty men, to be at the command of Gov. Fletcher during the war ; the rest of the militia, as usual, under the Governor of Connecticut. Until the session in October, 1698, the General Assembly consisted of but one house, and the magistrates and deputies appear to have acted together. But at this time it was enacted that the Assembly should consist of two houses. The governor, or in his absence, the deputy governor, and magistrates, composed the upper house. The lower house consisted of deputies, now usually called representatives, from the several towns in the colony. This house was authorized to choose a speaker to preside. From this time no public act could be passed into a law, but by the consent of both houses. In 1701, it was enacted that the October session of the Assembly should be annually held in New Haven. Previous to this time, and ever since the union of the colonies, the Assembly had convened, both in May and October, at Hartford. About this time, for the maintenance of good morals, and the sup pression of vicious and disorderly practices, the Assembly \" ordered, that a sober and religious man be appointed, by the county court in t Trumbull's History of Connecticut. * Colonel Bayard's letter on file. 4"], [38, "26 OUTLINE HISTORY. each of the counties, to be an attorney for her majesty to prosecute all criminal offenders.\" At this period the colony was in a critical situa tion. It was in danger and put to a great expense on account of the war with France ; it was also continually harassed by the demands of Dudley, Governor of Massachusetts, and of Lord Cornbury, Governor of New York and the Jerseys, for men and money, as they pretended, for the defense of their respective governments. Dudley, it appears, wished to unite all New England under his own government. If this could be effected, it seems Cornbury expected to have the government of the southern colonies. These men, having a powerful party at court, would have probably succeeded in their plans had it not been for the efforts of Sir Henry Ashurst, who was an agent for Connecticut, and a firm friend to the rights of the colonies. The expedition for the reduction of the French in Canada, in 1709, was the occasion of the first emission of paper money in Connecticut. In this expedition Connecticut was obliged to raise 350 men, who were placed under the command of Col. Whiting, of which ninety perished in this disastrous campaign. On the 8th of June, 1709, at a special Assembly, it was enacted, \" That to assist in the expedition, for want of money otherwise to carry it on, there be forthwith imprinted a certain number of bills of credit, on the colony, in suitable sums, from two shillings to five pounds, which, in the whole, shall amount to the sum of 8,000 pounds, and no more.\" It was enacted that the bills should be issued from the treasury as money, but should be received in payments at one shilling on the pound better than money. One half only was to be signed and issued at first, and the other was to remain unsigned until it should be found necessary to put it into circulation. Taxes were imposed for the calling in of one half of it within the term of one year, and the other at the expi ration of two years. The number of inhabitants in Connecticut in the year 1713, was about 17,000. There were four counties, (Hartford, New London, New Haven and Fairfield,) and thirty eight taxable towns, who sent forty delegates to the Assembly. The militia consisted of a regiment to each county, and amounted to nearly 4,000 effective men. At this time the shipping in the colony consisted of two small brigs and twenty sloops ; the number of seamen did not exceed one hundred and twenty. There was but a single clothier in the colony, \" and the most he could do was to full the cloth which was made ; most of the cloth manufac tured was worn without shearing or pressing.\" The trade was very limited. The only articles directly exported to Great Britain were tur pentine, pitch, tar, and fur. The principal trade was with Boston, New York, and the West Indies. To the two former places they traded in the produce of the colony : wheat, rye; barley, Indian corn, peas, pork, beef, and fat cattle. To the West Indies the merchants exported horses, staves, hoops, pork, beef and cattle. In return they received rum, sugar, molasses, cotton wool, bills of exchange, and sometimes small sums of money."], [39, "OUTLINE HISTORY. 27 The General Assembly met twice in a year, but their sessions did not generally exceed ten days. The annual expense of the two ses sions was about 1,600 dollars. The salary of the governor was about 800, and that of the deputy governor 200 dollars. The whole expense of government did not probably exceed 3,500 dollars. This amount was usually below the salary annually allowed to a royal governor in the colonies. Although the colony had been able to maintain their charter privile ges against the intrigues of Dudley, Cornbury, and other enemies, yet they were under many apprehensions that their chartered privileges would be taken from them. There were strong parties in England, and some in the colonies, who were unfriendly to the charter govern ments \u2014 deeming them too independent of the crown and government of Great Britain. In addition to these circumstances, a decision in England in regard to one of the laws of the colony respecting intestate estates, created much alarm. John Winthrop, Esq. son of the last Governor Winthrop, became disaffected towards the government ; he conceived that his family had been injured, and that his ancestors had not been rewarded according to the public services which they had ren dered to the colony. He had been engaged in a long controversy with Thomas Lynchmere, Esq. The court of probate, as he imagined, had made an unjust and illegal settlement of his paternal estate in favor of his sister, Mrs. Lynchmere ; he therefore, after going through the courts osthe colony, in which he was unable to obtain redress, appealed to his majesty. Upon hearing the case in England, the law of Connecticut was adjudged repugnant to English law, as not securing the lands to male heirs and admitting daughters to a share in the paternal estate, which the English laws did not warrant. In July, 1728, the colony received a letter from their agent, Jeremiah Dummer, Esq. declaring that their law respecting the settlement of intestate estates was \" null and void.\" The Legislature, deeming that the consequences of annulling this law would be disastrous to the internal peace of the colony, determined to spare no pains or expense in order to prevent it. They employed another agent, Jonathan Belcher, Esq. afterwards Governor of Massa chusetts, to assist agent Dummer in his defense of the colony, and in pleading for the continuance of the law respecting intestate estates. These agents conducted the affairs osthe colony with such wisdom and success that the charter was preserved and the law retained. In the expedition of the New England colonies against Louisburg, in 1745, Connecticut furnished upwards of 1000 men. For the en couragement osthe men to enlist, the Assembly voted a bounty of ten pounds to each soldier who should furnish himself with arms, knapsack and blanket ; and three pounds to every soldier who should not be able to arm himself. Five hundred men were divided into eight companies, and Roger Wolcott, Esq. lieutenant governor, was appointed the com mander. At the time of the siege, 200 men were sent on in addition, by Connecticut, and after the reduction of Louisburg, the colony pro vided 350 men to keep garrison during the winter. A sloop was also furnished, manned with 100 men."], [40, "28 OUTLINE HISTORY. While the war continued against the French in Canada, Connecticut made great exertions, and did more most of the time than doublejier proportion, compared with the rest osthe colonies. In the year 1759, she had more than six thousand men in actual service. At this period the militia were more numerous than at present, according to the popu lation, as all from the age of sixteen to sixty, were obliged to bear arms. In the year 1762, the New England colonies rendered very important services in the reduction of Havanna and Martinique. It was, how ever, a fatal enterprise to most of the New England troops ; of nearly 1000 men, who were engaged in the expedition, not 100 returned. Such as were not killed in the service, were swept away by the bilious plague. After the definitive treaty of peace, signed at Paris, Feb. 10th, 1763, which ended the French wars, the extension of settlements, commerce, wealth and population in Connecticut, were extremely rapid. \"After the peace, an almost boundless scope of commerce and enterprise was given to the colonists. In these favorable circumstances, with the re turn of thousands of her brave and industrious inhabitants to the culti vation of their fields, and the various arts and labors of peace, the colony was soon able to exonerate itself from the debt contracted by the war.\" These prosperous circumstances continued till the beginning of the Revolution. Connecticut, by her charter, granted in 1662, extended from Narra gansett river on the east to the South Sea on the west, excepting such lands as were then occupied by prior settlers. Nearly nineteen years afterwards, William Penn obtained a grant of lands on the west side of the Delaware river, extending northward to the 43d degree of latitude ; this covered part of the territory embraced in the Connecticut charter. For nearly a century after the charter was obtained, Connecticut neg lected to claim these lands, which lay westward of the colony of New York. But after she had granted all her lands eastward of that colony, a company was formed with the design of planting the lands within her charter, on the Susquehannah. This company was formed in 1753, and the next year a purchase was made from the sachems of the Six Nations of a large tract, at Wyoming. In 1774, the settlement was formed into a town, called Westmoreland, which sent representatives to the Assembly of Connecticut. The treaty of the Connecticut men with the Indians, and their pur chase osthe lands, excited the jealousy of the proprietaries of Pennsyl vania. They proceeded to take a deed osthe same lands from some of the chiefs, who declined signing the deed to the Connecticut purcha sers. Grants of land were made by Pennsylvania, and settlements be gun, which excited warm disputes, and an attempt was made to drive the Connecticut settlers from the lands by force of arms. In 1770, the Legislature of Connecticut sent certain questions to England to be'pro posed to the most able lawyers there, respecting her title to the lands in question. The answers were favorable to her claims, and she de termined to support them. But the Revolutionary war suspended the controversy, until 1781, when both states agreed to appoint commis-"], [41, "OUTLINE HISTORY. 29 sioners to settle the dispute. An act of Congress was passed, constitu ting these commissioners a court to hear and determine the controversy. In November, 1782, the commissioners met at Trenton, N. J. This court decided that Connecticut had no right to the lands in question, and that the territory comprised in the chartered limits of Pennsylvania belonged of right to her. Although Connecticut acquiesced in the de cision at Trenton, yet she maintained her claim to all the territory within the range of the north and south boundaries of the state, as expressed in the charter, lying west of Pennsylvania, and extending to the Mis sissippi. With a view to obtain the implied sanction of their charter claims, Connecticut in 17S6, by their delegates in Congress, ceded to the United States all the lands within the charter limits, west of Penn sylvania, excepting a tract 120 miles in length, adjoining that state on the west. This cession was accepted. A part of the reserved lands, amounting to half a million of acres, was granted by the state to the inhabitants of New London, Fairfield and Norwalk, whose property had been destroyed by the enemy during the Revolutionary war. The remainder was sold in 1795, and the money arising from the sale con stitutes the School Fund, for the support of schools throughout the state. The title of Connecticut to the reserved lands, was confirmed by Con gress in 1800. This territory, now forming part of the state of Ohio, is still called the Connecticut or Western Reserve. During the great struggle osthe Revolution, Connecticut was one of the foremost in the confederacy in resisting the tyranny of Britain, and was lavish of her blood and treasure in sustaining the conflict against her oppressions. Her soldiers were applauded by the commander in chief of the American armies for their bravery and fidelity. In the last war with Great Britain, in the first conflict on the ocean, the first flag was struck to a native of Connecticut: on the land, the first flag which was taken, was also surrendered to one of her sons. The sounders of Connecticut were men of intelligence, virtue and piety, and understood the great principles of civil and religious liberty; hence they laid the foundations of those institutions which distinguish her among her sister states osthe Union. Ever republican in her form of government, she has in effect, ever been a free and independent com- monwealth ; and whilst the other colonies were suffering under the dom- ination of Royal Governors, she has from the beginning, been governed by rulers of her own choice. After the declaration of independence, Connecticut did not follow the example of most of the other states, and adopt a written constitu- tion, but continued the government according to the ancient form ; a statute being enacted, the session following the declaration of American independence, July 4th, 1776, which provided that the government should continue to be organized and administered according to the pro- visions osthe charter. This form of government continued without any very essential alteration till 1818. In this year, a convention of dele- gates from the several towns, elected by the people, convened in Hart- ford, and after a session of about three weeks, framed a constitution of civil government for the state. This being submitted to the electors"], [42, "30 HARTFORD COUNTY on the 5th of October, 1818, was ratified by them by a majority of fifteen hundred and fifty four votes.

HARTFORD COUNTY. Hartford County was constituted such in 1666. Its original limits comprised an extensive district of country on both sides of Connecticut river, the entire county of Tolland, most of the counties of Middlesex and Windham, and a part of the counties of Litchfield and New London. The present extent osthe county is about 30 miles from north to south, and averages 25 miles in breadth from east to west. It is bounded n. by Hampden County in Massachusetts, e. by Tolland County, w. by Litchfield, and s. by the counties of Middlesex and New Haven. This county as a whole, in resources, wealth and population, will rank before any other in the state ; and in many respects, before any in New Eng land. The valley of the Connecticut is justly celebrated for the extent and richness of its meadows; and there is no section throughout its whole course, where they are more enlarged or fertile than in this county. The soil generally is rich, various and fertile, and is for the most part highly cultivated ; well adapted to a grain culture, particularly that of rye and Indian corn, of which large quantities are annually raised. The county is intersected nearly in the center by Connecticut river; in its western part by a range of greenstone mountains, called in some parts the Talcott Mountains. It is watered by several streams, among which are the Farmington, Hockanum, Scantic and Podunk rivers, all of which discharge their waters into the Connecticut. A great variety of manufactures is carried on in the county, many of which are extensive, and employ a considerable amount of capital. They will be noticed in the account osthe several towns. The follow ing is a list of the several towns in the county, with the population ac cording to the census of 1830."], [43, "HARTFORD. 31 Hartford, - - 9,789 Avon, - - 1,025 Berlin, - - 3,037 Bloomfield, - Bristol, - - 1,707 Burlington, - 1,301 Canton, - - 1,437 East Hartford, 2,237 | Manchester, - 1,576 East Windsor, 3,537 Marlborough, 704 Enfield, - - 2,129 Simsbury, - 2,221 Farmington, - 1,901 Soutbington, - 1,844 Glastenbury, 2,980 Suffield, - - 2,690 Granby, - - 2,722 Wethersfield, 3.853 Hartland, - - 1,221 Windsor, - 3,220 HARTFORD. The first English settlement in Hartford was commenced in 1635, by Mr. John Steel and his associates from Newtown, (now Cambridge,) in Massachusetts. The main body of the first settlers, with Mr. Hooker at their head, did not arrive till the following year. \"About the beginning of June, (says Dr. Trumbull,) Mr. Hooker, Mr. Stone, and about one hundred men. women and children, took their departure from Cambridge, and traveled more than a hundred miles, through a hideous and trackless wilderness, to Hartford. They had no guide but their compass, and made their way over mountains, through swamps, thickets and rivers, which were not passable but with great difficulty. They had no cover but the heavens, nor any lodgings but those that simple nature afforded them. They drove with them a hun dred and sixty head of cattle, and by the way subsisted on the milk of their cows. Mrs. Hooker was borne through the wilderness upon a lit ter. The people carried their packs, arms, and some utensils. They were nearly a fortnight on their journey.\" \"This adventure was the more remarkable, as many of this company were persons of figure, who had lived in England, in honor, affluence and delicacy, and were entire strangers to fatigue and danger.\"* The Indian name of Hartford was Suckiag. A deed appears to have been given by Sunckquasson, the sachem of the place, about 1636, to Samuel Stone and William Goodwin, who appear to have acted in be half of the first settlers. The town of Hartford is bounded n. by Windsor and Bloomfield, e. by Connecticut river, s. by Wethersfield, and w. by Farmington and Avon. It is about six miles in length from north to south, and aver ages about five in breadth.

That part near the river is covered with a strong clay, or a rich black mold. The latter is prin cipally in the valuable tract of meadow adjacent to Connecticut river. Hartford City was incorporated in 1784; it is over a mile in length upon the river, and about three fourths of a mile in breadth. The alluvial flat upon the river is narrow, being from 40 to 100 rods, and is connected with the upland by a very gradual elevation. It is sit uated on the west side of Connecticut river, 50 miles from its mouth, in Lat. 41\u00b0 45' and Long. 4\u00b0 15' e. from Washington. It is 123 miles n. e. New York, 34 n. n. e.

The city is rather irregu larly laid out, and is divided at the south part by Mill or Little river. East view of the Stone Bridge in Hartford. Across this stream a fine bridge of free stone has been thrown, which connects the two parts of the city. This structure is 100 feet wide, supported by a single arch, 7 feet in thickness at the base, and 3 feet 3 inches at the center, the chord or span of which is 104 feet ; ele vation from the bed of the river to the top of the arch, 30 feet 9 inches. Another bridge, across Connecticut river, 1,000 feet long, and which cost over $100,000, unites the city with East Hartford. Hartford is very advantageously situated for business, is surrounded by an extensive and wealthy district, and communicates with the towns and villages on the Connecticut above, by small steamboats, (now 8 in number) two of which, for passengers, ply daily between Hartford and Springfield. The remainder are employed in towing' flat bottomed boats of 15 to 30 tons burthen, as far as Wells' river, 220 miles above the city.

The American Asylum for the deaf and dumb, the Retreat for the insane, and Washington College, are all beautifully located, in the im mediate vicinity of the city. The population within the city limits in September, 1835, was nine thousand and eight hundred. \" The American Asylum for the education and instruction of deaf and dumb persons, was founded by an association of gentlemen in Hart ford, Conn, in 1815. Their attention was called to this important charity by a case of deafness in the family of one of their number. An interesting child of the late Dr. Cogswell, who had lost her hearing at the age of two years, antl her speech soon after, was, under Providence, the cause of its establishment. Her father, ever ready to sympathize with the afflicted, and prompt to relieve human suffering, embraced in his plans for the education of his own daughter, all who might be simi larly unfortunate. The co-operation of the benevolent was easily se cured, and measures were taken to obtain from Europe a knowledge of the difficult art, unknown in this country, of teaching written language through the medium of signs, to the deaf and dumb. For this purpose, the Rev. Thomas H. Gallaudet visited England and Scotland, and ap plied at the institutions in those countries for instruction in their system; but meeting with unexpected difficulties, he repaired to France, and obtained at the Royal Institution at Paris, those qualifications for an instructor of the deaf and dumb, which a selfish and mistaken policy had refused him in Great Britain. Accompanied by Mr. Laurent Clerc, himself deaf and dumb, and for several years a successful teacher under * Darby and Dwight's Gazetteer of the United States, 1833. 5"], [46, "34 HARTFORD. the Abbe Sicard, Mr. Gallaudet returned to this country in August, 1816. The Asylum had, in May preceding, been incorporated by the state legislature. Some months were spent by Messrs. Gallaudet and Clerc in obtaining funds for the benefit of the institution, and in the spring of 1817, the Asylum was opened for the reception of those for whom it was designed, and the course of instruction commenced with seven pupils. View of the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb. \"As the knowledge of the institution extended, and the facilities for obtaining its advantages were multiplied, the number of pupils increased from seven to one hundred and forty, which for several years past has not been much above the average number ; and since its commence ment in 1817, instruction has been imparted to four hundred and sev enty seven deaf and dumb persons, including its present inmates. \"In 1819, Congress granted the institution a township of land in Alabama, the proceeds of which have been invested as a permanent fund. The principal building, of which the above is a front view, was erected in 1820, and the pupils removed to it in the spring of the fol lowing year. It is one hundred and thirty feet long, fifty feet wide, and, including the basement, four stories high. Other buildings have been subsequently erected, as the increasing number of pupils made it necessary ; the principal of which is a dining hall and workshops for the male pupils. Attached to the institution are eight or ten acres of land, which afford ample room for exercise and the cultivation of vege tables and fruits for the pupils. \"The system of instruction adopted at this institution is substantially the same as lhat of the French school at Paris. It has however been materially improved and modified by Mr. Gallaudet and his associates. This system, and indeed every other rational system of teaching the deaf and dumb, is based upon the natural language of signs. By this we mean those gestures which a deaf and dumb person will naturally use to express his ideas, and to make known his wants previous to"], [47, "V HARTFORD 35 instruction. These gestures and signs are rather pictorial, that is, an exact outline of the object, delineated by the hands in the air; or de scriptive, giving an idea of an object by presenting some of its promi nent and striking features; or conventional, such as may have been agreed upon by a deaf and dumb person and his associates. As there are very few objects which can be expressed with sufficient clearness by the delineation of its outline alone, a descriptive sign is usually con nected with it. Thus, in making the sign for a book, the outline is first delineated by the fore finger of both hands. To this is added the de scriptive signs of opening the book, placing it before the eyes, and moving the lips as in reading. It may therefore simplify the classifica tion of natural signs if the first two divisions be united ; and it will be suf ficiently accurate to say that all the signs used by the deaf and dumb, are either descriptive or conventional. By far the greater part of these signs belong to the former class ; as it includes the signs for most com mon objects, actions and emotions. A deaf and dumb child constructs his language upon the same principle as the child who can hear ; that of imitation. \" In the school-room, the instructor makes use of natural signs to communicate ideas to his pupils, of systematic signs to enable them to translate their own into written language ; of the manual alphabet, or signs of the hand corresponding to the letters of the alphabet; and of written symbols to express the grammatical relations of words. A more particular account osthe mode of instruction would be inconsistent with the limits assigned to this article. Indeed it can hardly be neces sary to enlarge on this topic, as visitors can at all times have access to two of the classes, and on Wednesday afternoon to all the classes, when they are permitted to witness the process of imparting instruction by signs, and to make such inquiries as will enable them to understand the subject. \" The pupils usually remain at the Asylum four or five years, in which time an intelligent child will acquire a knowledge of the common ope rations of arithmetic, of geography, grammar, history, biography, and of written language, so as to enable him to understand the Scriptures, and books written in a familiar style. He will of course be able to converse with others by writing, and to manage his own affairs as a farmer or mechanic. There are workshops connected with the institu tion, in which the boys have the opportunity of learning a trade, and many of them, by devoting four hours each day to this object, become skillful workmen, and when they leave the Asylum, find no difficulty in supporting themselves. The annual charge to each pupil is one hun dred dollars. '\u2022'The department of instruction is under the control osthe principal of the institution, who has also a general oversight of the other depart ments. The pupils are distributed into eight or nine classes, the im mediate care of which is committed to the same number of assistant instructors. When out of school, the pupils are under the care of a steward and matron."], [48, "36 HARTFORD. \"Five or six similar institutions have been established in different parts osthe country, all of which have obtained their system of instruc tion, and some of their teachers, from the American Asylum. Nearly one half of the states afford the means of obtaining an education at some one of these schools, to their own indigent deaf and dumb ; and it is greatly to be desired that the legislatures of all the other states should furnish the same assistance to these children of misfortune.\"* Eastern view of the Retreat for the Insane. \"This institution is situates! on a commanding eminence, at the dis tance of a mile and a quarter, in a southwesterly direction, from the State House in Hartford. The elevation overlooks an ample range of fertile country, presenting on every side a most interesting landscape, adorned with every beauty of rural scenery, that can be found in rich and cultivated fields, and meadows of unrivalled verdure ; in extensive groves and picturesque groups of sorest, fruit and ornamental trees; and above all, in the charming diversity of level, sloping and undulating surfaces, terminating by distant hills, and more distant mountains. \"The city of Hartford is conspicuously seen on the left, and in dif ferent directions, five flourishing villages, rendered nearly continuous by numerous intervening farm-houses. On the east, the prospect is enlivened by the perpetual passing and repassing of carriages and trav elers, on the two principal thoroughfares of the country, that extend along the front osthe building, one at the distance of fifty or sixty rods, the other within three fourths of a mile. Still farther eastward, but within a mile and a half, the prospect is frequently enlivened by the splendid show of passing steamboats, and the white sails of various wa ter craft, plying up and down the Connecticut river, which is distinctly seen in many long windings. \" This site was selected as one pre-eminently calculated to attract and engage the attention, and soothe and appease the morbid fancies and feel ings osthe patient, whose faculties are not sunk below or raised above the * American Magazine, Vol. I, 1835."], [49, "HARTFORD 37 sphere of relations that originally existed.

Its style of architecture is perfectly plain and simple, and interests only by its symmetrical beauty, and perhaps by the idea it impresses of durability and strength, derived from the massy solidity of its materials \u2014 yet notwithstanding these, its general aspect is remarkably airy and cheerful, from the amplitude of its lights, and the brilliant whiteness of its exterior. The. whole build ing is divided into commodious and spacious apartments, adapted to various descriptions of cases, according to their sex, nature and disease, habits of life, and the wishes of their friends. The male and female apartments are entirely separated, and either sex is completely seclu ded from the view osthe other. Rooms are provided in both male and female apartments for the accommodation of the sick, where they are removed from any annoyance, and can continually receive the kind at tentions of their immediate relations and friends. Attached to the build ing are about seventeen acres of excellent land, the principal part of which is laid out in walks, ornamental grounds and extensive gardens. With each wing and block of the building is connected a court-yard, en compassed by high fences, and handsomely laid out, designed to afford the benefit of exercise, pastime and fresh air, to those who cannot safely be allowed to range abroad. \" Connected with the institution, there are horses and carriages, which are appropriated exclusively to the benefit of the patients, and which afford them much pleasant exercise and amusement. The male patients frequently employ themselves in the garden, and amuse them selves at the backgammon board, draughts, and the like. The female patients employ themselves in sewing, knitting, drawing, painting, play ing on the piano, and other amusements. The various exercises and amusements are adapted to the age, sex, and former habits of the pa tients, and in all cases the two sexes are kept entirely separate. There isa library in the Retreat, composed of light and agreeable works, and several periodicals and newspapers are constantly taken, for the perusal of which the inmates manifest much fondness.

Every thing connected with the institution, is designed to make it a pleasant and agreeable residence for all the inmates. \" This institution commenced its operations on the 1st of April, 1824, under the immediate charge of the late Eli Todd, M.

The same system of management has been adopted by"], [50, "38 HARTFORD. his successor, Silas Fuller, M. D. recently of Columbia, and has also been attended with similar success. Dr. Fuller has for many years had the charge of a private establishment for the insane, and has been distinguished for his success in treating this afflictive disease. The general system of moral treatment at this institution is, to allow the patients all the liberty and indulgences consistent with their own safety and that of others ; to cherish in them the sentiment of self respect ; to excite an ambition for the good will and respect of others ; to draw out the latent sparks of natural and social affection ; and to occupy their attention with such employments and amusements, as shall exercise their judgment, and withdraw their minds as much as possible from every former scene and every former companion ; and give an entire change to the current of their recollections and ideas. By pursuing this course, together with a judicious system of medication, many 'of these once miserable beings, cut off from all the 'linked sweetness' of con jugal, parental, filial, and fraternal enjoyment, are now restored to the blessings of health, to the felicities of affection, and to the capacity of performing the relative duties of domestic and social life.'\"* Eastern view of Washington College. \" Washington College was sounded in 1826.

In that sermon he says, \" I am now the oldest officiating minister of the gospel in this state, and, as far as I can learn, in the United States. And I cannot learn, from the history of churches in Connecticut, that there has ever before been an instance of one of its ministers preaching for sixty years uninterruptedly to the same congregation ; nor during a life of eighty three years, have I ever met with one who had preached the gospel of the grace of God to one and the same people for the same period.\" \"Titus Hosmer, the father of the late Chief Justice Hosmer, of Middletown, was a native of West Hartford. He was one of the most distinguished scholars, lawyers and statesmen which Connecticut has produced. He was a member of the Council, and of Congress, and Judge of the Maritime Court of Appeals for the United States. He was the patron of Joel Barlow, in encouraging the composition of his Vision of Columbus, the title of the poem first published.

The above engraving was made from a large lithographic print in the 17th vol. of Prof. Silliman's Journal of Science. The perpendic ular strata of rocks which appear in the engraving are termed by geolo gists Trap Rocks, of the variety called greenstone. This ridge is one of a series of isolated peaks and groups that divide the states of Con necticut and Massachusetts almost centrally in two ; commencing in the East and West Rocks in New Haven and terminating on the bor ders of Vermont.

The rocks in the engraving which lie in a horizontal position are sandstone, called by the masons free stone, to obtain which this quarry has been worked for more than a century. This quarry is about three miles nearly s. s. w. from the city of Hartford, the ridge is on the eastern exposure almost covered with soil. \" As you come from Hartford on the old Farmington road, you gently rise the acclivity of a hill, for perhaps three or four hundred yards, and as you reach its summit you discover the trap ridge, breaking through the soil on your right and left, and stretching away northeast and southwest like a line of fortification. This allusion appears still more appropriate when you discover, on coming to the edge of the parapet, that the vast rampart is faced with a deep ditch, just such an one as defense would require, were the ridge covered by cannon and bristling with bayonets. This ditch is the excavation which (as its ob ject was peaceful) it has taken a century to make.\" The portion of the rocky ridge represented in the engraving is about eighty feet, in the horizontal direction ; the trap is there twenty eight feet thick, and the sandstone that is cut through is sixteen feet, so that the whole height at this place is about forty feet. The water in the hollow is an accu mulation of rain, in the bottom of the quarry. \" Both rocks, as thus cut through for nearly a mile, in this extensive quarry, exhibit a magnificent section ; such as a geologist wishing to study the origin of the trap rocks, would be most anxious to see, but would hardly expect to find. To others, the place is worth visiting on account osthe beauty osthe scenery. In the retrospect towards Hart ford, is the grand and rich valley of the Connecticut \u2014 before you, the vales of Newington and West Hartford, almost equally beautiful ; and the view in both directions, is bounded by hills and mountains, which, to the north and south, appear interminable.\" It is now believed by all geologists, that the materials composing the trap rocks were melted in the bowels of the earth, and thrown upward through the incumbent strata by igneous action, and that the peculiar formation of these rocks, presenting solid masses, in which, in general, the appearance of fire is not obvious, was caused by the pressure of water from above, it being unquestionable among geologists, that our globe was once covered with a deep ocean. The cut on the next page is a representation of the point of land in the limits of the city of Hartford, now called Dutch Point. The entrance of Mill river into the Connecticut is seen in the engraving In 1633 the Dutch erected a fort and trading house on the south side of this stream, which they called the ii7r.se of Good Hope. Thirty or forty years since, some of the remains of the fort were in existence, being washed out of the earth by the river. Since that time, the river has worn away the site osthe fort.

They in veigled an Indian woman, who, being liable to public punishment, fled from her master. Though her master demanded her as his property, and the magistrates as a criminal, on whom the law ought to take its course, yet they would not deliver her up. The Dutch agent, in the height of disorder, resisted the guard. \" He drew his rapier upon the soldiers, and broke it upon their arms. He then escaped to the fort, and there defended himself with impunity.\" Considerable difficulty oftentimes arose between them and the English settlers, till the year 1654, when an order from the Parliament arrived, requiring that the Dutch should in all respects be treated as the declared enemies of the commonwealth of England. In conformity to this order, the General Court convened, and an act was passed sequestering the Dutch house, lands, and property of all kinds at Hartford, for the benefit of the com monwealth. Dutch Point, in Hartford. \"The Dutch,\" says Dr. Trumbull, \"were always mere intruders. They had no right to any part of this country. The English ever de nied their right, and when the Dutch placed a governor at New Neth erlands, and the court of England made complaint of it to the States General, they disowned the affair, and said it was only a private under taking of an Amsterdam West India company. King James the first commissioned Edward Langdon to be governor at New Netherlands, and named the country New Albion. The Dutch submitted to the English government, until the troubles in England, under the adminis trations of King Charles the first and the long parliament.\" When William Holmes came up the river in 1633, to establish a tra ding house at Windsor, he found that the Dutch had got up the river before him, made a light fort, and planted two pieces on Dutch Point. \" The Dutch forbid Holmes going up the river, stood by their cannon, and ordered him to strike his colors, or they would fire upon him.\" 6"], [54, "42 HARTFORD. Holmes being a bold and resolute man, informed them that he had a commission from the governor of Plymouth to go up the river, and that he must obey his orders. Disregarding their threats, he proceeded up the river and established the trading house.\"* First Meeting House built in Connecticut. The above is believed to be a correct representation of the first house ever erected in Connecticut for Christian worship. The drawing was obtained from a gentleman now deceased, who devoted considerable time and attention to antiquarian researches in Hartford : the drawing of Mr. Hooker's house was obtained from the same individual. In Dr. Strong's consecration sermon, in 1S07, it is stated that the first house for public worship was built in 1638, stood ninety nine years, and was then taken down. There must have been some mistake about this, as it appears by a reference to the early records of the town, that there was a meeting house in 1635, and in 1650, \"it was ordered that the old meeting house shall be given to Mr. (or Airs. ?) Hooker. Some of the timber of the first house is still in existence, a portion of it being used in the construction of the Center Congregational Church. \u2022 Gov. Bradford of Plymouth gives thp following account: \"The Dutch, with whom we had formerly converse and familiarity, seeing us seated in a barren quarter, told us of a river called by them Fresh River, which they often commended to us for a fine place, both for plantation and trade, and wished us to make use of it; but our hands being full otherwise, we let it pass. But afterwards there coming a company of In dians into these parts, who were driven thence by the Pequents, (Pequots,) who usurped upon them, they often solicited us to go thither, and we should have much trade, espe cially if we would keep a house there .... we began to send that way and trade with the natives. But the Dutch begin now to repent ; and hearing of our purpose and preparation, endeavor to prevent us, get in a little before us, make a slight fort and plant two pieces, threatening to stop our passage. But we having a great new bark, and a frame of a house, &c ready, that we may have a defense against the Indians, who are much offended that we bring home and restore the right sachems of the place called Natawannut .... though challenged by the Dutch, who stood by their ordnance, ready fitted, &c pass along, and the Dutch threaten us hard, yet they shoot not. And this was our first entrance there: we did the Dutch no wrong: for we took not a foot of any land they bought; but went above them, and bought that tract of land which belonged to the Indians we carried wilh us, and our friends with whom the Dutch had nothing to do.\" \u2014 Holmes' Annals, Vol. I."], [55, "HARTFORD. 43 Rev.

Age seems to have curtailed its branches, yet it is not exceeded in the height of its coloring, or richness of its foliage. The trunk measures twenty one feet in circumference, and near seven in diameter. The cavity, which was the asylum of our charter, was near the roots, and large enough to admit a child. Within the space of eight years, that cavity has closed, as if it had fulfilled the divine purpose for which it had been reared.\" Sir Edmund Andross being appointed the first governor general over New England, arrived in Boston, in December, 1686. From this place he wrote to the colony of Connecticut to resign their charter, but with out success. \" The Assembly met as usual, in October, and the govern ment continued according to charter, until the last of the month. About this time, Sir Edmund, with bis suite and more than sixty regular troops, came to Hartford when the Assembly were sitting, and demanded the charter, and declared the government under it to be dissolved. The Assembly were extremely reluctant and slow with respect to any resolve to surrender the charter, or with respect to any motion to bring it forth. The tradition is, that Governor Treat strongly represented the great expense and hardships of the colonists in planting the country ; the blood and treasure which they bad expended in defending it, both against the savages and foreigners ; to what hardships he himself had been exposed for that purpose ; and that it was like giving up his life, now to surrender the patent and privileges so dearly bought and so long enjoyed. The important affair was debated and kept in suspense until the evening, when the charter was brought and laid upon the table where the Assembly were sitting. By this time great numbers of peo ple were assembled, and men sufficiently bold to enterprise whatever might be necessary or expedient. The lights were instantly extin guished, and one Captain Wadsworth, of Hartford, in the most silent and secret manner, carried off the charter,f and secreted it in a large hollow tree, fronting the house of Hon. Samuel Wyllys, then one of the magistrates of the colony. The people all appeared peaceable and orderly. The candles were officiously relighted, but the patent was gone, and no discovery could be made of it, or the person who carried it away. Sir Edmund assumed the government, and the records osthe colony were closed in the following words : \"At a General Court at Hartford, Oct. 31, 1687, his excellency Sir Edmund Andross, knight, and captain general and governor of his ma jesty's territories aud dominions in New England, by order of his majesty James II. king of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, the 3lst of October, 1687, took into his hands the government of the colony of Connecticut, it being by his majesty annexed to Massachusetts and other colonies under his excellency's government.

The canoe in which he came down from Dartmouth College, was a large log hollowed out, and about sixty feet in length. \" When Hartford was first settled,\" says Dr. Webster,* \" the main street was laid out very wide, and nearly a mile in length. At each end a fort was built : that at the north end was near the house now oc cupied by the descendants of Col. Talcott ; that at the south was on or near the side of the late south school house, at the forks of the road \u2014 one leading to Wethersfield, the other to Farmington. The garrison could see from one fort to the other. The land east of Front street was called the Little Meadow, and being cleared or more valuable than the upland, it was divided among all the settlers, each having a small part. The principal men had from three to four acres each, and others less. \" The Dutch fort was erected at the mouth of the Little river, on the south side. When I was young, I saw some of the bricks which had been brought from Holland, which were washed out of the banks of the Connecticut. The river has since worn away the banks beyond the site of the fort.\" * The venerable Noah Webster, LL.

This street was originally wet or swampy land, and in wet weather the mud was very deep. This con tinued to be the case down to the year 1790 or '91, when the town voted to cover it with stone, and annually appropriated a tax ol four pence on the pound for that purpose for several years.\" ' After the Revolution, Hartford became the residence of a number of the most celebrated poets of the day. Among the most distinguished was Trumbull, (the author of Me Fingal) Barlow, Hopkins and Dwight. The vein of satire and wit which appeared in many of their produc tions, derived for them the appellation of \" the Hartford Wits.\" The Anarchiad was published in portions, in the Connecticut Mag azine, during the years 1786 and 1787. Dr. Hopkins was the projec tor of this work, and had considerable share in writing it. \" It was a mock critical account of a pretended ancient epic poem, interspersed with a number of extracts from the supposed work. By a fable con trived with some ingenuity, this poem is represented as known to the ancients, and read and imitated by some of the most popular modern poets. By this supposition, the utmost license of parody and imitation is obtained, and by the usual poetical machinery of episodes, visions and prophecies, the scene is shifted backwards and forwards, from one country to another, from earth to heaven, and from ancient to modern times. This plan is filled up with great spirit ; the humorous is indeed much better than the serious part, but both have merit, and some osthe parodies are extremely happy. The political views of the authors were to support those designs which were then forming for an efficient federal Constitution.\"* This poem had an extensive circulation through the country, and had considerable influence upon the public mind. The Echo was a work which attracted considerable attention at the time. This was a medley of burlesque and satirical pieces, originally designed to hold up to derision a taste for the bombast and the bathos, very prevalent at that period among newspaper writers. This work was begun about the year 1791, by two persons, viz. Richard Alsop, of Middletown, and Theodore Dwight, and with the exception of por tions of two or three numbers, was written exclusively by them. Dr. M. F. Cogswell wrote a few lines in one number, and Dr. Lemuel Hopkins and Dr. E. H. Smith wrote parts of one or two others.f The plan of the work was soon extended ; and from ridiculing affectations of style, they directed their satire against the political doctrines and measures of their opponents, as party spirit at this period began to wax warm. The Echo soon became principally occupied in responding travesties of public speeches, and writings of a political cast. These pieces were, with some others by the same authors, collected into a * Analectic Magazine. t There has been a number of accounts given respecling the origin and the authors ol the Echo which are incorrect ; ihe above statement respecting the authors of the work, rmy be relied upon as correct, as it was obtained from an undoubted source"], [63, "51 HARTFORD. volume which was published in 1807, illustrated by several humorous designs by Mr. Tisdal. The following is the Boston editor's account of the thunder storm, which was the occasion of drawing forth the first Echo. \" On Tuesday last, about four o'clock, P. M. came on a smart shower of rain, at tended with lightning and thunder, no ways remarkable. The clouds soon dissipated, and the appearance of the azure vault, left trivial hopes of further Deedfnl supplies fiom the uncorked bottles of heaven. In a few moments the horizon was again over shadowed, and an almost impenetrable gloom mantled the face of the skies. The wind frequently shifting from one point to another, wafted the clouds in various di rections, until at last they united in one common center, and shrouded the visible globe in thick darkness. The attendant lightning, with the accompanying thunder, brought forth from the treasures that embattled elements to awful conflict, were ex tremely vivid and amazing loud. Those buildings that were defended by electric rods, appeared to be wrapped in sheets of vivid flame, and a flood of the pure fire roll ed its burning torrents down them with alarming violence. The majestic roar ofdis ploding thunders, now bursting with a sudden crash, and now wasting the rumbling Echo of their sounds in other lands, added indescribable grandeur to the sublime scene. The windows of the upper regions appeared as thrown wide open, aDd the trembling cataract poured impetuous down. More salutary showers, and more need ed, have not been experienced this summer. Several previous weeks had exhibited a melancholy sight: the verdure of fields was nearly destroyed ; and the patient hus bandman almost experienced despair. Two beautiful rainbows, the one existing in its native glories, and the other a splendid reflection of primitive colors, closed the magnificent picture, and presented to the contemplative mind the angel of mercy, clothed wilh the brilliance of this irradiated arch, and dispensing felicity to assembled worlds. It is not unnatural to expect that the thunder storm would be attended with some damage. We hear a barn belonging to Mr. Wythe, of Cambridge, caught fire from the lightning, which entirely consumed the same, together with several tons of hay, &c.\" This is echoed in the following manner: \" On Tuesday last great Sol, with piercing eye, Pursued his journey through the vaulted sky, And in his car effulgent roll'd his way Four hours beyond the burning zone ofday ; When lo! a cloud, o'ershadowing all the plain, From countless pores perspired a liquid rain, While from its cracks the lightnings made a peep, And chit-chat thunders rock'd our fears asleep. But soon the vapory fog dispersed in air, And left the azure blue-eyed concave bare : Even the last drop of hope, which dripping skies Gave for a moment to our straining eyes, Like Boston rum, from heaven's junk bottles broke, Lost all the corks, and vanish'd into smoke. \" But swift from worlds unknown, a fresh supply Of vapor dimm'd the gieat horizon's eye ; The crazy clouds, by shifting zephyrs driven, Wafted their courses through the high-arch'd heaven, Till piled aloft in one stupendous heap, The seen and unseen worlds grew dark, and nature 'gan to weep. Attendant lightnings stream'd their tails afar, And social thunders waked ethereal war, From dark deep pockets brought their treasured store, Embattled elements increased the roar \u2014 Red crinkling fires expended all their force, And tumbling rumblings steer'd their headlong course. Those guarded frames by thunder poles secured, Though wrapp'd in sheets of flame, those sheets endured; O'er their broad roofs the fiery torrents roll'd, And every shingle seem'd of burning gold.

Since the adoption of the present Constitution, Election days have taken place alternately in Hartford and New Haven. From this period the progress of reform has been so far extended, that nearly the whole of the ceremonies here described, have been dispensed with ; first, the clergy were not allowed to dine at the public expense ; next, the Governor's Guards were restricted in the same manner. The Le gislature next dispensed with the Election sermon, and lastly, for two or three years past the members osthe Assembly formed no procession. \" I reached Hartford atnoon, on Wednesday, the 19th ofMay, 1807. The city is on the west bank of the Connecticut, forty five miles above its mouth. The governor, whose family residence is on the east side of the river, at some distance from Hartford ', was expected to arrive in the evening. This gentleman, whose name is Jonathan Trumbull, is the son of the late Governor Jonathan Trumbull ; and though the elec tion is annual, he has himself been three or four years in office, and will almost cer tainly so continue during the remainder of his life. It was known that the votes were at this time in his favor. \" The governor has volunteer companies of guards, both horse and foot. In the afternoon the horse were drawn up on the banks osthe river, to receive him, and es cort him to his lodgings. He came before sunset, and the fineness of the evening the"], [65, "HARTFORD. 53 beauty osthe river, the respectable appearance of the governor and of the troop, the dignity ot the occasion, and the decorum observed, united to gratify the spectators. The color of the clothes of the troop was blue. The governor, though on horseback, \u25a0was dressed in black; but he wore a cockade, in a hat which I did not like the less, because it was in its form rather osthe old school than osthe new. \" In the morning, the foot guards were paraded in front osthe State House, where they afterwards remained under arms, while the troop of horse occupied the street which is on the south side of the building. The clothing of the foot was scarlet, wilh white waistcoats and pantaloons; and their appearance and demeanor were mili tary. \" The day was fine, and the apartments and galleries of the State House afforded an agreeable place of meeting, in which the members of the Assembly and others awaited the coming osthe governor. At about eleven o'clock, his excellency entered the State House, and shortly after took his place at the head of a procession, which \u2022was made to a meeting house or church, at something less than half a mile distant. The procession was on foot, and was composed of the person of the governor, to gether with the lieutenant governor, assistants, high sheriffs, members of she lower house of assembly, and unless with accidental exceptions, all the clergy of the State. It was preceded by the foot guards, and followed by the horse ; and attended by ga zers, that, considering the size and population of the city, may be said to have been numerous. The church, which from its situation is called the South Meeting House, is a small one, and was resorted to on this occasion, only because that more ordinarily used was at the time rebuilding. The edifice is of wood, alike unornamented within and without; aud when filled, there was still presented to the eye nothing but what had the plainest appearance. The military remained in the street, with the exception of a few officers, to whom no place of honor or distinction was assigned; neither the governor nor other magistrates were accompanied with any insignia of office ; the clergy had no canonical costume, and there were no females in the church, except a few (rather more than twenty in number) who were stationed by themselves in a gal lery opposite the pulpit, in quality of singers. A decent order was the highest char acteristic that presented itself. \" The pulpit, or, as it is here called, the desk, was filled by three, ifnot four clergy men ; a number which, by its form and dimensions it was able to accommodate. Of these, one opened the service with a prayer, another delivered a sermon, a third made a concluding prayer, and a fourlh pronounced a benediction. Several hymns were sung; and among others an occasional one. The total number of singers was be- tween forty and fifty. \" The sermon, as will be supposed, touched upon matters of government. When all was finished, ihe procession returned to the Slate House. The clergy who walked were about a hundred in number. \" It was in the two bodies of guards alone, that any suitable approach to magnifi cence discovers itself. The governor was full dressed, in a suit of black; but the lieutenant governor wore riding boots. All, however, was consistently plain, and in unison with itself, except the dress swords which were worn by high sheriffs, along with their village habiliments : and of which the fashion and the materials were mar velously diversified. Arrived in front of the State House, the military formed on each side of the slreet ; and as the governor passed them, presented arms. The sev eral parts of the procession now separated ; each retiring to a dinner prepared for itself at an adjoining inn; the governor, lieutenant governor, and assistants to their table, the clergy to a second, and the representatives to a third. The time of day was about two in the afternoon. \" Only a short time elapsed before business was resumed ; or ralher, at length com menced. The General Assembly met in the council room, and the written voles being examined and counted, the names osthe public officers elected were formally declar ed. They were in every instance the same as those which had been successful the preceding year, and for several years before. \" This done, the lieutenant governor administered the oath to the governor elect, who being sworn, proceeded to administer their respective oaths to the lieutenant governor and the rest; and here terminated the affairs of the election day. Soon after six o'clock, the military fired llueefeux dejoies, and were then dismissed. \" On the evening following that osthe election day, there is an annual ball at Hart ford, called the election ball ; and on the succeeding Monday, a second, which is more select. The election day is a holiday throughout the State ; and even the whole re mainder osthe week is regarded in a similar light. Servants and others are now in demnified for the loss of the festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, which Ihe principles of their church deny them.

The whole day, like the morning, and like the evening which preceded it, was fine. In Hartford, ihe degree of bustle w as suni cient to give an air of importance to the scene; a scene that taken altogetner w as not unfitted to leave on ihe mind a pleasing and respectful impression, i he follow ing are the words osthe occasional hymn, which as I have said was sung: \" Hail, happy land ! hail, happy State !

With one consent now let us raise The thankful tribute of our praise To him who rules the sky ! \" The mercies He to us hath shown \u2014 The wonders He for us hath done, His sovereign hand proclaim ; Come, and with grateful hearts adore The God who saves us by His power, And bless aloud his name ! \" Come, let us kneel before His face, Devoutly supplicate His grace, And His high aid implore ; That he, our nation, state, and land, May save by His Almighty Hand, Till time shall be no more !\" EXTRACTS FROM NEWSPAPERS.

A number of young gentlemen were preparing fire works for the evening, in the chamber of the large brick school house,* under which a quantity of powder granted by the Assembly for the purposes of the day, was deposited. Two companies of militia had just received a pound a man, by the delivery of which a train was scattered from the powder cask to the dis tance of three rods from the house, where a number of boys were collected, who unde signedly and unnoticed, set fire to the scattered powder, which was soon communica ted to that within doors, and in an instant reduced the building to a heap of rubbish, and buried the following persons in its ruins, viz.

When the Editors of the Connecticut Courant and American Mercury first enlar ged their papers, they flattered themselves that they should be able to continue them at the original price of seven shillings per annum, without subjecting themselves lo too great a loss. But from the very great rise of every arlicle of family consumption, and the consequent depreciation of money, they find it no longer practicable. In do ing it, they are subjecting themselves to a loss of nearly one half the real value of their labor. Allowing their papers to have been as good as they formerly were before their enlargement, they presume that their customers would have justified them for increasing the price of them. in proportion to the increase of their size. And since every thing else has risen at least fifty per cent, and some articles more than a hun dred, they conceive it but reasonable lhat they should, after previously notifying their customers, float along with the general tide. Influenced by these motives, they hereby inform their customers, that from the first of January next, the price osthe Connec ticut Courant and American Mercury will be nine shillings per annum, or two shil lings and three pence a quarter, which is only about half the advance of almost every other article. At the same time that they acknowledge with grateful sensations, the liberal encouragement which a generous public have given them, they engage lhat no exertion on their part shall be wanting to merit a continuance of it; and that they will endeavor lo render their'papers acceptable lo iheir customers, by embracing every opportunity which may offer for improving them.

As ihere had not been an execution in this place tor a considerable number ofyears, a large concourse of people collected from the neighboring towns to witness this melancholy spectacle. It is generally thought there were from six to ten thousand persons present. \u201e Atone o'clock, P. M. the people congregated on the east side osthe State House in this citv, from the portico of which the Rev. Mr. Strong delivered a sermon (by par ticular desire osthe unhappy prisoner) from the following words ol the prophet fio sea, chapter vi. verse 6. \" For I desired mercy and not sactifice ; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offering.\" About three o'clock Ihe prisoner, guarded by two companies of militia, atlended by several clergymen, the high sheriff of the county of Hartford, and his deputies, proceeded to the place of execution ; and at half past four, the scaffold was dropped from under him. As he had from the first, so he to the last moment of his existence, persisled in denving his having been guilty ol willlul murder. He told the same story uniformly. On this occasion every part osthe exer cise was performed with the greatest decency and propriety; and we are happy to add, that amid such a number of people, no unfortunate accident took place. Connecticut Courant, Hartford Dec. 30th, 1799. In consequence of Ihe afflicting intelligence of the death of General Washington, divine services were performed at the north meeting house in this town on Friday last. The town never exhibited a more solemn and interesting appearance. Notice having been given to the inhabitants of this and the neighboring towns, the concourse of people was greater, than almost ever was known on any former occasion. The stores and shops were shut through the day \u2014 all business suspended \u2014 the bells were muffled, and tolled at intervals, from nine in ihe morning until the services commen ced. The meeting house was greatly crowded, and still a large proportion of the people could not get in at the doors. The services were appropriate, solemn and im pressive. A very eloquent and pathetic sermon was delivered by the Rev. Nalhan Strong, to a most attentive, devout, and mourning audience, from Exod. xi. 3. \" And the man Moses was very great,\" &c. The music was solemn and sublime; and the whole scene exhibited in the strongest of all possible colors, the deep affliction of the people at a loss utterly irreparable. The floods of tears, the badges of mourning which were universally worn, ihe church hung in black, a procession of many hun dreds of persons, composed of men of all classes, and Ihe solemn grief picluied on every countenance, made impressions on the minds of the beholders, which many years will not efface. We presume that the sentiments and feelings which inspired the persons present, pervade the country, on the distressing event which called them together. However divided into parties on political subjects, with respect to the char acter of this great man, we trust there is but one opinion in the United States. As he lived beloved and admired, he has died truly lamented ; and his memory will be hon ored as long as wisdom, viitue and piety shall be esteemed among men. \" The beau ty of Israel is slain upon the high places; how are the mighty fallen.\" The following Hymn* was sung on the melancholy occasion \u2014 What solemn sounds the ear invade !

David Gardiner, whose death it records, was the first white child born in Connecticut. He removed, it appears, with his father, Lyon Gardiner, to Gardiner's Island, and coming to Hartford, probably on puhlic business, died suddenly. The stone is placed horizontally over his grave, and (1836) partly imbed ded in the earth, and was with some difficulty deciphered. John G. Gardiner, Esq. the gentleman to whom the author is indebted for the account of Capt. Kidd, (p. 23,) mentions that his father erected a mon ument to the memory of his ancestors on Gardiner's Island, in June, 1806. On this monument it is stated, that Lyon Gardiner died in 1663. \"David, his son, born at Saybrook, April 29, 1636, the first white child born in Connecticut, died 16 \u2014 . Mary, his wife, whom he married at Westminster, England, died 16 \u2014 .\" It appears by this that Mr. Gardiner did not know at what lime or at what place his ancestor died ; it was supposed by the family, (previous to the discovery of the monument at Hartford, by the author of this work, in 1835,) that he was buried somewhere on Gardiner's Island. \" We have,\" says Mr. Gardiner, \" an old Bible in the house, which belonged to Lyon Gardiner, upon a blank leaf of which the following is written. \" In the year of our Lord, 1635, the 10th of July, came I, Lion Gar diner and Mary my wife from Worden, a town in Holland, where my wife was born, being the daughter of one Diricke Willemson deureant ; her mother's name was Hachir, and her aunt, sister of her mother, was the wife of Wouter Leanerdson, old burger Muster, dwelling in the hostrade, over against the Bruser in the Un-icorne's head ; her brother's name was Punce Garretson, also old burger Muster.

AVON. This town was originally a parish in the north part of Farmington, by the name of Northington. It was incorporated as a distinct town in 1830. It is bounded n. by Canton and Simsbury, e. by Hartford and Bloomfield, w. by Burlington, and s. by Farmington. It is about 6 miles in length, and upwards of 5J in breadth. This township is for the most part a level and fertile tract of land, in the valley osthe Far mington river, between two mountainous ridges, on the east and west. The population osthe town in 1830, was 1,025. Eastern view of Avon The above is a representation of the central part of Avon, as it ap pears to the observer while descending Talcott mountain to the west ward. This place is 9 miles from Hartford, and 6 north of Farmington. Farmington river runs nearly at the base of this mountain at this place. Its course is seen in the engraving, by the tops of the trees and bushes in the fore ground, immediately before the person who is looking to the westward : immediately above the head of the person represented, is seen the Baptist church, without a spire, having eight windows on the"], [75, "AVON 63 east side. The Congregational church is seen beyond. The New Haven and Northampton Canal passes between these churches. The ancient Northington meeting house stood a few rods from the Farmington river, about 1\u00a3 miles s. e. osthe Congregational church seen in the\u00b0en graving : it was burnt down nearly twenty years since.* The meeting houses now standing in the town, three in number, 2 Congregational and 1 Baptist, were built immediately after the old one was destroyed.

In the north eastern corner of this town, about two miles north from the main road which passes over Talcott mountain, is \" Wadsworth's Tow er,\" so called from Daniel Wadsworth, Esq. of Hartford, who erected it, and also a summer-house and other buildings in the immediate vicin- * \"I once attended public worship there,\" sa)'s Prof. Silliman, \"on a pleasant but warm summer sabbath. The house was almost embowered in ancient sorest trees: it was smaller than many private dwelling houses \u2014 was much dilapidated by time, which had furrowed the gray unpainted shingles and clapboards, wilh many water worn channels, and it seemed as if it 'would soon fall. It was an interesting remnant of primeval New England manners. The people, evidently agricultural, had scarcely departed from the simplicity of our early rural habils; the men were not parading in foreign broadcloth, nor the women flaunting in foreign silks and muslins; but they appeared in domestic fabrics, and both men and women were dressed with simplicity. I do not mean that there were no exceptions, but this was the general aspect of Ihe con gregation, and, from the smallness of the house, although there were pews, it seemed rather a domestic than a public religious meeting. The minister corresponded admi rably wilh the appearance of the house and congregation, as far as antiquity and pri meval simplicity were concerned, but he was highly respectable for undeistanding, and sustained even in these humble circumstances, the dignity of his slalion.

This place is also called Monte Video, and is remarkable for its beauty in natural scenery : it is a place of resort for parties of pleasure from Hartford and other places in the vicinity. Having ascended the summit of Talcott mountain, those who wish to visit this spot must fol low an obscure road which turns directly to the north. \" The road is rough, and the view bounded on the east by the ridge, which in many places rises in perpendicular cliffs, to more than one hundred feet above the general surface of the mountain. At the end of a mile and a half, the road terminates at a tenant's house, built in the Gothic style, and at this place the scene is immediately changed. At the right, the ridge, which has seemed an impassable barrier, suddenly breaks off and disap pears, but rises again at the distance of half a mile, in bold gray masses, to the height of one hundred and twenty feet, crowned by sorest trees, above which appears a tower of the same color of the rocks. The space or hollow caused by the absence of the ridge, is occupied by a deep lake of the purest of water, nearly half a mile in length, and somewhat less than half that in width. Directly before you to the north, and ex tending about half a mile, is a scene of cultivation, interspersed with trees, in the center of which stands a summer-house. The ground is gently undulating, bounded on the west by a precipice which overlooks Far mington valley, and inclining gently to the east, where it is terminated by the margin of the trees that skirt the lake.\" The tower is situated on the summit of the ridge, standing within a few rods of the edge of the precipice. \" The tower is a hexagon, of 16 feet diameter, and fifty five feet high ; the ascent of about eighty steps, on the inside, is easy, and from the top, which is nine hundred and sixty feet above the level of Connecticut river, you have at one view, all those objects which have been seen separately from the dif ferent stations below. The diameter of the view in two directions, is more than ninety miles, extending into the neighboring states of Massa chusetts and New York. . . . The little spot of cultivation surrounding the house and the lake at your feet, with its picturesque appendages of boat, winding paths, and Gothic buildings, shut in by rocks and forests, compose the fore ground of this grand panorama. On the western side, the Farmington valley appears in still greater beauty than even from the lower brow, and is seen to a greater extent, presenting many objects which were not visible from any other quarter. On the east is spread before you, the great plain through which the Connecticut river winds its course, and upon the borders of which the towns and villages are tra ced for more than forty miles. The most considerable place in sight is Hartford, where, although at the distance of eight miles in a direct line, you see, with the aid of a glass, the carriages passing at the intersection osthe streets, and distinctly trace the motion and position osthe vessels, as they appear, and vanish, upon the river, whose broad sweeps are seen, like a succession of lakes, extending through the valley. The whole of this magnificent picture, including within its vast extent culti vated plains and rugged mountains, rivers, towns and villages, is encir cled by a distant outline of blue mountains, rising in shapes of endless variety.\""], [77, "65 BERLIN. BERLIN. Berlin was incorporated as a town in 1785. It was previously the second society of Farmington, by the name of Kensington ; \u2014 a sec tion of the towns of Wethersfield and Middletown were joined to it at its incorporation. Kensington was probably set off from Farmington as a society about the year 1712, as the first minister, the Rev. Mr. Burnham, was ordained in that year. At this time there were but 14 families in the place, and the church consisted of 10 members, seven males and three females. Previous to the settlement of Mr. Burnham, these families attended meeting at Farmington, and the women walked from 10 to 12 miles and carried their infants in their arms. Kensing ton was divided about the year 1753, by the incorporation of the soci ety of New Britain ; and Dr. Smalley, the first clergyman in this soci ety, was ordained in 175S. In 1772, the society of Kensington was again divided, by the formation of the society of Worthington ; its name being derived from one osthe committee who located the society.* Northern view of Worthington, in Berlin. The township of Berlin is bounded north by Farmington, east by Middletown and Wethersfield, west by Soutbington, and south by Mer iden.

It is II miles from Hartford, 23 from New Haven, and 8 from Wethersfield. The manufacturing of tin ware on this side of the Atlantic, probably first commenced in this place. About the year 1 740, William or Edward Patterson, a native of Ireland, came to this country and settled in this place. His trade was that of a tinner ; and soon after his arrival, he commenced manufacturing tin ware, and continued in the business till the Revolution. He was then under the necessity of suspending it, as the raw material could not be obtained. After the war, this manufac- ture was carried on in this place, by those young men who had learned the art from Mr. Patterson ;* and from these persons the art has been extended over a number osthe neighboring towns. For a considerable time Mr. Patterson carried on the business alone, and peddled his own ware in a basket ; but the value of the article becoming known, others engaged in the business, and the ware was soon scattered over the coun- try. At first others as well as Patterson peddled in baskets, carried by hand or on horses ; afterwards two wheeled carts were introduced, but those being found inadequate for long journeys, were succeeded by one horse wagons, and these in some measure by very large carriages, with two and four horses. The wares manufactured of tin were vended at first in New England and New York, and then gradually in the south ern and western states. The first families who settled in New Britain, located themselves about half a mile east of the present village. The first meeting house in this parish was about half a mile northeast osthe present Congrega tional church. The eastern part of New Britain was first settled by 3 families osthe name of Judd, 3 osthe name of Smith, and one by the name of Patterson : the Lewises settled in the south part ; the western part was settled by 3 families of Andrews and 2 by the name of Hart : the northeast part by the Stanleys, Hart, and Smith. The first settlers in the village were osthe names of Lee, Judd, Booth and Mather. The cut on page 67 shows the central part of the fiourishin gvillage of New Britain.

The village, which has been built up within about a dozen years past, is situated around the border of what was formerly a kind of swamp, which by draining he. is now become quite valuable. New Britain contains about 1,500 inhabitants. The village contains 3 houses of worship; 1 Congregational, 1 Methodist and 1 Baptist. There are 45 factories in the society, principally brass facto ries ; upwards of 700 hands are employed, and about 650.000 dollars capital invested. The latitude of the village, as ascertained by E.

Great Proprietor of all ! 'tis thine To tread out Empires, and to quench ye Stars.\" BURLINGTON. Burlington originally belonged to Farmington, and was formerly known by the name of West Britain ; it was at the first called West Woods. Previous to its incorporation as a town in 1806, it was within the limits of Bristol. It is 17 miles west from Hartford, and about 36 from New Haven, bounded n. by New Hartford and Canton, e. by Farmington and Avon, w. by Harwinton, and s. by Bristol. It is about six miles in length from north to south, and five in breadth. The township is diversified with hills and valleys ; the soil is a gravelly loam, on granite rocks, yielding grain, particularly rye and oats. The inhab itants are principally engaged in agriculture. The population of the town in 1830 was 1,401. The Farmington river passes through the northeastern part osthe town. There are 2 houses for public worship, 1 for Congregationalists and 1 for Methodists. The eastern part of the town was first settled by a family osthe name of Strong, who were from Farmington ; the northern part by a family of Pettibones from Simsbury ; tbe western part by persons by the name of Yale, Lewis and Wiard ; the south part by families by the name ofBunel and Smith from Cheshire. The first minister in the place was the Rev. Jonathan Miller from Torringford ; he preached in this place about forty years ; he died three or four years since. About thirty years since there was a society of Seventh day Baptists in this place; at that period they consisted of about twenty five families, who were mostly from Rhode Island or the eastern part of Connecticut ; they had a Mr. Davis for their first minister, and Mr. Stillman for their last. They erected a house of worship, which is still standing. The society is nearly extinct, there being it is believed but one member now living: this person is an aged woman. The Methodists built their meeting house about twenty five years since. It formerly stood about 2i miles s. w. of its present loca tion ; it was removed to where it now stands in 1835. CANTON. Canton was first settled in 1740, and was incorporated as a town in 1806. The town was formed from the west section of Simsbury and the eastern part of New Hartford. It is bounded n. by Granby, s. by Avon and Burlington, w. by New Hartford and Barkhamsted, aud e. by"], [83, "71 CANTON Simsbury. It is about eight miles in length from north to south, and nearly four miles in breadth. The population in 1830, including Collinsville, was 1,437. The township is hilly and mountainous, and the prevailing character osthe soil is a coarse gravel, which is hard, dry and stony. The first settlement was made at the east village. This place was formerly called Suffrage, from the circumstance, it is said, of one of the first settlers experiencing an unusual share of suffering at the commence ment of the settlement. Western view of Collinsville, in Canton. The above is a view taken on the western side of the Farmington river, and shows as much of the village as could be conveniently given in one view. The houses of the workmen are principally on the west side of the stream, a part of which are seen on the left of the engraving. These buildings, which are built precisely of the same form, are com pactly set together on the side of a hill rising with considerable abrupt ness from the water. These houses are painted white, and when con trasted with the deep green foliage in the immediate vicinity, present a novel and beautiful appearance. Collinsville is 16 miles from Hartford and 16 from Litchfield, and contains upwards of 500 inhabitants, who are principally engaged in the manufacture of axes, of which they make from 700 to 800 daily, and of a superior kind. This village was estab lished by Messrs. Collins &i Co. in 1826, who at that period set up an edge tool manufactory at this place, and at one time 300 men were employed in the business. The following inscription is copied from a monument in the old bu rying ground in Canton. In memory of Deac. Thomas Bidwcll, who departed this life Dec. 3d, 1802, in the 64th year of his age. Unshaken in the great truths of the Gospel, in this he was as an iron pillar, and steadfast as a wall of brass. He lived and died in the confidence of his brethren. But though dead, he yet speaketh to the Church, to his family and to all who knew him. Thou tomb shall safe retain thy sacred trust, Till life divine reanimate his dust."], [84, "72 EAST HARTFORD. EAST HARTFORD. This town is pleasantly situated on the east side of Connecticut river, bounded n. by East Windsor, e. by Manchester, s. by Glastenbury, and w. by Connecticut river, separating it from Hartford. It is near|y 6 miles in length from north to south, and about 4 miles in breadth. Most of the inhabitants in this town live on one street, about three fourths of a mile from and parallel with the river. This street is thickly settled from Glastenbury to East Windsor. N. E. view of the Congregational Church, East Hartford. The above is a northeastern view of the Congregational Church in East Hartford street, erected in 1835. It is beautifully situated at the entrance of the principal avenue to Hartford city. The most striking feature in the appearance of East Hartford street, is the long row of large spreading elms situated in the center of the street ; these, with the shade and other trees on both sides, afford in summer a delightful prospect to the eye, which is rarely equalled. The meadows in this town, adjoining the Connecticut, contain an extensive range of some of the best land in the State. In the spring season these meadows are usually overflowed by the freshets of the river, which render them very productive. The causeway connected with the bridge over the Connecticut, extends about a mile in a straight line, across the meadows, to the main street in East Hartford, and forms a fine and prospective avenue to the city. Leaving these meadows, you rise rather a steep acclivity of fifteen or twenty feet, into a level plain country, extending across the entire length of the township, and nearly three miles to the eastward. The soil is fertile, and a large proportion of it is fitted for almost every kind of cultivation and pro duct. An excellent mill-stream, called the Hockanum river, enters this town 'from the northeast, and winds its way through nearly the center of the town, and unites with the Connecticut about a mile below Hart-"], [85, "73 EAST HARTFOHD. ford bridge. On this stream are many valuable mill seats, that give fa cilities to manufacturing operations, which are here carried on to a very considerable extent. East Hartford was for many years distinguished beyond any other town in the State, for tbe variety and amount of its manufactures. In 1775, a gunpowder mill was built here, under the especial patronage of the colony. It is believed to have been the first mill of the kind erected in the country. Iron works, consisting of art anchor shop, a forge and slitting mill, were built in this town in 1782. Anchors, mill screws, nail rods, gunpowder, paper, snuff, glass, &.c. were among the manufactures carried on here in 1784, with spirit and success. The making of paper, at present, is the principal manufactur ing business carried on within the limits of the town. There are five large paper mills, which are situated in a village called Scotland, about 2i miles eastward of the Congregational church, at a place formerly known by the name of \" Pitkin's falls.\" From one establishment in this village, the U. S. Congress is furnished with paper by contract. This town was formerly included in the limits of Hartford. It was incorporated as a distinct town in 1784. The fertility of the soil, af fording an easy cultivation of Indian corn, and the multitude of fish with which the rivers in this vicinity were stored, rendered this place a favorite residence osthe native Indians. At a meeting osthe inhabitants of Hartford, Jan. 11th, 1640, it was ordained, \" that all the upland on the east side osthe great river, from Podunk river to Pewterpot river, shall be divided to the three miles' end ; that is to say, half a mile of it to be measured and staked, and each man's proportion to run up the country to the three miles' end.\" And on the same day a committee was appointed to order the highway in the meadow, on the east side of the great river. The original set- tlers generally located themselves on the rising ground back from the meadow, where several of their cellars are still visible. In 1677, a more rapid and extensive settlement of this town appears to have taken place. Several new highways were laid out in the course of that year. In 1694, an ecclesiastical society was constituted, and early in 1703, the Rev. Samuel Woodbridge, their first settled clergyman, was ordained. The church and people here were united during the life and ministry of Mr. Woodbridge, who labored with them forty three years. He died June 9th, 1746, aged 63. The Rev. Eliphalet Williams, D.D. his successor, was ordained March 30th, 1748. For more than fifty years he was a settled minister in this town. The Podunk tribe, which dwelt in this and the adjoining town of East Windsor, were a ferocious and warlike people. Tontonimo, their first sachem with whom the English had any acquaintance, commanded two hundred bowmen. When the council of ministers assembled in Hartford, in 1657, the famous Mr. Elliot, hearing of the Podunk Indians, desired that the tribe might be assembled, that he might have an opportunity of offering Christ to them for their Saviour. By the influence of some of the principal gentlemen, they were persuaded to come together at Hartford, and Mr. Elliot preached to them in their own language, and labored to 10"], [86, "74 EAST HARTFORD. instruct them concerning their Creator and Redeemer. When he had finished his sermon, and explained the matter to them, he desired an answer from them whether they would accept of Jesus Christ for their Saviour, as he had been offered to them ? But their chief men, with great scorn and resentment, utterly refused. They said the English had taken away their lands, and were now attempting to make them servants.* \" In the year 1656, a Podunk Indian, named Weaseapano, murdered a sachem, who lived near Mattabeseck, now Middletown. Seaquassin, the existing sachem of the tribe, complained of the outrage to the magis tracy of Connecticut; and said that the Podunk Indians entertained the murderer, and protected him from the merited punishment. Seaquassin at the same time engaged Uncas in his cause; who also complained, that Tontonimo enticed away many of his men ; and protected an Indian who had murdered a Moheagan. Upon these complaints the magis trates summoned the parties before them. Seaquassin and Uncas, after observing that the murderer was a mean fellow, and that the man mur dered was a great sachem, insisted that ten men, friends of Weaseapano, should be delivered up, to be put to death, as a satisfaction for the crime. Tontonimo insisted that the satisfaction demanded was excessive ; par ticularly as the murdered sachem had killed Weaseapano's uncle. The Governor endeavored to convince the complainants that the demand was excessive ; observing, that the English in cases of murder, punish ed only the principal, and such as were accessory to the crime. \" Tontonimo then proposed to make satisfaction by the payment of wampum ; but it was refused. They fell however in their demands to six men, instead often. This proposition was rejected by Tontonimo. The magistrates then urged him to deliver up the murderer. This he promised to do. But, while the subject was in agitation, he privately withdrew from the court, with the rest of the Podunk sachems ; and retired to the fortress belonging to his nation. Both the magistrates and the complainants, were offended by this behavior of Tontonimo. However, the magistrates appointed a committee, to persuade the Indi ans to continue at peace with each other. At their solichation Uncas at length consented to accept the murderer, and promised to be satisfied, if he should be delivered up ; but the Podunk Indians told the English that they could not comply with this condition, because the friends of Weaseapano were numerous and powerful, and would not agree to the proposal. The Governor then addressed them in form ; urging them to continue in peace, and endeavoring to persuade the complainants to ac cept of wampum. This they again refused, and withdrew ; after it had been agreed on all bands, that the English should not take any part in the controversy ; and after the Indians had promised, that they would not injure either the persons or possessions of the English, on either side of the river. _ \" Soon after, Uncas assembled an army for the purpose of aven<nn<r his wrongs.

He sent a trusty warrior, furnished with some Mohawk weapons, to Podunk ; directing him to set fire in the night to a house near the fort, and then to leave the weapons on the ground in the vicinity, and immediately return. The warrior executed his com mission. When the Podtinks came in the morning to examine the ruins, they found the weapons ; and, knowing them lo belong to the Mohawks, were so alarmed with the apprehension that Uncas was about to execute his threat, that they delivered up the murderer, and sued for peace.\"* The Hon. William Pitkin, the ancestor osthe Pitkin family of this town, emigrated from the county of Middlesex, Eng. and settled here in 1659. He was by profession a lawyer, and also one osthe principal planters of the town. In 1664, he receivetl the appointment of king's attorney for the colony. He died in 1694, after having filled various and important offices, distinguished for his virtues and abilities. He had a sister who emigrated soon after him to this country, who it is said possessed uncommon vigor of mind and many fine accomplishments. She married Simon, the youngest son of Henry Wolcott, was mother of the first Governor Wolcott, and grandmother of Oliver Wolcott and Roger Griswold, governors of Connecticut, and also great grandmother of the late Hon. Oliver Wolcott, of Litchfield. There have been a number of distinguished individuals of the name of William Pitkin in this town, one of whom was governor of the State, who was distin guished for his vigorous understanding and integrity ; he died in 1769, while holding the office of governor. His son, the Hon. William Pit kin, was in 1758 appointed major of the Connecticut forces, raised for the expedition against Canada. He served through the campaign un der General Abercrombie, and acquired the reputation ofa faithful and gallant officer. He was a member of the Council during the Revolu tionary war, and for the greater part osthe war he served as a member osthe Council of Safety. He died in 1789.

EAST WINDSOR. East Windsor was originally included within the ancient bounda ries of Windsor. Fear of the Indians appears to have prevented any settlement in this town on the east side of the Connecticut till 1680.* By this time the Indian power in New England was effectually broken, by the death of King Philip in 1676. Although the Windsor and River Indians professed themselves neuter in Philip's war, yet numbers of their young men stole away and never returned. In 1695, the set tlers of East Windsor formed themselves into an ecclesiastical society, and Mr. Timothy Edwards, the father of the celebrated divine, was ordained their minister. Previous to this, the inhabitants for fifteen years passed tbe river in boats, in order to attend worship on the west side. In 1768, East Windsor was incorporated as a town, and con tained at that period four parishes, viz. 1st Society or East Windsor, 2d Society or Scantic, Ellington and Wapping. East Windsor is bounded n. by Enfield, e. by Ellington and Ver pon, s. by East Hartford and Manchester, and w. by Connecticut river. It is about 10 miles in length, and averages upwards of 5 in breadth. The face of the town is generally level. In the western part of the town there are extensive tracts of sandy loam, which are light, warm, and fertile ; in the eastern part a rich gravelly loam generally prevails. Upon the borders of Connecticut river there are natural meadows, which comprise more than 2,000 acres of the finest of land, uncom monly beautiful and fertile, producing grass, Indian corn, potatoes, &te. in great abundance. The eastern and northern parts of the town are best adapted for rye, of which it has been computed that 70,000 bush* els have been raised in one season. Of late years considerable quan tities of tobacco have been raised and manufactured in the western part osthe town. The principal street runs parallel with Connecticut river, on the border of the first elevation of ground above the meadows, gen erally about a mile back from the river, and on this street, through the whole length of the town, is built an almost continuous village. The Second or North Society was made a parish in 1752; the Rev. Thomas Potwine was ordained their first pastor in 1754. Scantic river, a mill stream, passes through this part of the town, and gives this section the name of Scantic. The village of Wapping in thesoutheast part of the town, was allowed the privileges of a winter parish in 1761. Ware house Point is a considerable village on the Connecticut river, near the northern boundary osthe town, at the head of sloop navigation. For merly the manufacture of rye gin was an important branch of business * Dr. McClure's account of Windsor, Vol. 5, Mass. Hjst, Coll."], [89, "EAST WINDSOR. 77 in this place ; of late years, considerable attention has been paid to the cultivation of tobacco. The place derived its name from a warehouse being built here by Mr. Pyncheon, of Springfield, about the time of the first settlement of that place. It is 13 miles from Hartford. There are now in the town 7 churches; 3 Congregational, 2 Methodist, 1 Episco palian and 1 Baptist. Theological Institute at East Windsor. The above is a southeastern view of the \" Theological Institute of Connecticut,\" established in 1834. This building, constructed of brick, contains a chapel, reading room, recitation room, room for the library, and other rooms sufficient for the accommodation of fifty two students ; they are furnished with stoves and all necessary articles of furniture, except bed clothing. The library contains rising of 3,000 volumes, and is receiving accessions continually. There is a farm belorifin\" to the Institution of about sixty acres, and a workshop furnished with tools, affording facilities for manual labor to such students as choose to avail themselves of the privilege. \" No charge is made to the students for tuition, room rent, or the use of the library.\" \" Candidates for admission to this seminary must produce satisfactory testimonials that they possess competent talents, and are members of some Christian church in good standing, and that they have graduated at some college, or have otherwise made literary acquisitions, which, as preparatory to theological studies, are substantially equivalent to a lib eral education ; and they shall be examined with reference to their per sonal piety, and their object in pursuing theological study. \"The course of study occupies three years, and it is expected that in all ordinary cases, students will enter with the intention of comple ting a full course. The different branches of study will be pursued si multaneously, so far as practicable ; but Biblical Interpretation will be the most prominent branch for the first year ; Systematic Theology, for the second ; and Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology, for the third."], [90, "78 EAST WINDSOR. Church History will occupy about an equal proportion of each year. There are two vacations in the year, of five weeks duration ; the first commencing on the first Thursday in September, the second on the second Thursday in April.\" The institution is eight miles from Hartford, and about two miles north of the first Congregational church ; a step-stone belonging to the house of the Rev. Timothy Edwards, the father of Jonathan Edwards, is in serted in the northeast corner of the building. The Podunk tribe of Indians resided at or near the mouth of Podunk river or brook, a small stream entering the Connecticut river at the south west corner of the town. A part of the same tribe, or some tribe that were in alliance with them, appear to have resided near the mouth of Scantic river. The following traditions respecting the Indians, in this town are preserved. A party of Mohawks visited the tribe who resided at the mouth of Scantic river: as one of the Mohawk women was cross ing the river on a log she was pushed off into the stream and drowned ; the Mohawks upon this withdrew, determined upon revenge. In the meanwhile the Scantic Indians sent a runner to the Podunk Indians for assistance ; after collecting their forces, a battle took place, in which the Mohawks were defeated and fled ; they remained in the vicinity, and whenever they found a straggler from either tribe, they inflicted summary vengeance. As one of the settlers by the name of Bissell was at work at hay in the meadow, a Scantic Indian came running towards him and implored his protection ; he directed him to lie down, Mr. Bissell then rolled a cock of hay upon him, and he was in this manner effectually concealed. This was no sooner done than two Mohawks came running furiously in pursuit ; they wished to know of Mr. Bissell if he had seen the object of their pursuit ; he pointed out a particular direction in which he gave them to understand he had seen him run, which they eagerly followed, and by this means the Scantic Indian finally escaped. The Podunks, who were a small tribe,* had two places of residence, one at the mouth of the Podunk river, during the summer; the other, where they resided during the winter, was a mile or a mile and a half east from this, over the high land ; the path between these two places still retains the name of \" King's path ;\" their burying ground, lately discovered, was about half way between. A young Indian and squaw of this tribe having been to gather whortleberries, it was so late before they had gathered a sufficient quantity, that they were afraid to cross the meadows after dark, on account of the Mohawks, and accordingly stayed at the house of Mr. Williams. In the morning early, the young Indian woman set out upon her return ; soon after, a report of a <?un was heard by the inhabitants in the vicinity, who immediately turned out to see the cause. They found the young woman weltering in her blood, having been shot by two Mohawks. The Podunks were aroused ; they mustered sixteen or eighteen warriors, and went in pursuit. After being out several days, they came to a corn field and began plucking * The Podunk tribe, in King Philip's war, contained between two and three hun dred men, who went off in that war and never relumed.\u2014 Mass. Hist. Coll. Vol. 10."], [91, "79 EAST WINDSOR. the ears. A party of Mohawks, who it seems were lying in ambuscade, rose upon them, and killed the whole party, with the exception of two who made their escape. This severe blow had the effect of breaking up the Podunks as a distinct tribe ; they separated into two parties, one of which joined the Pequots towards New London. In the south part of the town, where Podunk river crosses the road to Hartford, was an Indian burying ground. A few years since, a num ber of skeletons were discovered, by digging from one to four feet. These skeletons were found lying on one side, knees drawn up to the breast, arms folded, with their heads to the south. A covering of bark seems to have been laid over them, with some few remains of blankets; in one instance a small brass kettle and hatchet were found in good preservation ; the remains of a gun barrel and lock, a number of glass bottles, one of which was found nearly half filled with some sort of liquid. These articles were probably obtained from the Dutch, either by present or by trade. There were also found a pair of shears, a pistol, leap pipes, strings of wampum, small brass rings, glass beads; a female skeleton with a brass comb: the hair was in a state of preserva tion wherever it came in contact with the comb. After the Podunks had removed from these parts, in one instance they were known to have brought a dead child from towards Norwich and interred it in this burying place. At Bissell's ferry, near the mouth of Scantic river, is a well which is supposed to have been made before any English settlements were attempted in Connecticut. The lower part of the well is walled by stones hewn in a circular manner, and the manner in which they are laid together is believed to be entirely different from that in which any Englishmen would lay them \u2014 there remains no traditions respecting the time, or the persons by whom this well was constructed. In the expedition against Louisburg, in the island of Cape Breton, in 1745, Major General Roger Wolcott, of this town, (afterwards gov ernor,) commanded the Connecticut troops on that occasion. After the capture of that place, many of the soldiers from this town, and other places on the river, removed with their families and settled in the towns of Windsor and Annapolis, in Nova Scotia. In the Revolutionary war, after the capture of Burgoyne, a conside rable number of his men, British and Hessians, were quartered in this town. The Hessians were a fine looking body of men: many of them became so much attached to the country and its inhabitants, that their officers found it difficult to collect their men when they went off, and in fact some secreted themselves so closely that they could not be found. Gov. Franklin, the royal governor of New Jersey, and Gen. Prescott, who was surprised and taken by Col. Barton, of Rhode Island, were both quartered, while prisoners, at the house of Capt. Ebenezer Grant, which is now standing, a few rods south of the Theological Seminary."], [92, "80 EAST WINDSOR. The following relation relative to the art of \" fortune telling, (as it is generally termed,) was given to the compiler of this work some years since, by Mr. E R , an aged, respectable, and conscientious inhabitant of this town, a short time before his death. In giving rela- tions of this kind, the author merely states what was related to him by persons who would receive full credit on every other subject. It ought to be mentioned, that Mr. R. was a person of sound sense, and not at all superstitious. Mr. R. stated, that when a young man, he was very fond of company and jollity. He became acquainted with a man who it was believed possessed the art of fortune telling. This man agreed to initiate Mr. R. into the mystery of the art- ; this was done by a particular method of handling a pack of playing cards. Mr. R. however, had but little faith in the efficacy of the process, but for the sake of amusing himself and his friends, set himself up as a kind of conjuror. After practicing a short time, he became so celebrated that persons came from a considerable distance \" lo have their fortunes told.\" Mr. R. said he could describe a person that he never saw, as completely as he could if the person stood before him, as to the size, color of the hair or eyes, or any thing about the person, with a minute- ness and accuracy which astonished those that heard him. When asked how he attained such knowledge, he replied that while he was shuffling over his cards, it would be suggested to his mind what to say, or as he expressed it, \" the words came to him,\" and he spoke them. He said, however, he did not know that he described things accurately, till he was so informed by those who applied to him. Mr. R. at length be- came so well satisfied in his own mind that he was assisted by some power superior to his own in these transactions, that he broke off, and refused to make any further attempts of this nature. Jonathan Edwards, who is considered the greatest of modern divines, was a native of this town. He was born Oct. 5th, 1703, about one mile north of the first Congregational church, and a few rods north of a small stream crossing the road, called Stoughton's brook. His father's house (the Rev. Timothy Edwards) stood on the east side of the road, and resembled very much the appearance of Mr. Hooker's, (page 43.) \" He was educated at Yale College, and took the degree of bachelor of arts in 1720 before he was seventeen years of age. His uncommon genius discovered itself early' and while he was yet a boy he read Locke on the human understanding with a keen relish. Though he took much pleasure in examining the kingdom of nature yet moral and theological researches yielded him the highest satisfaction. He lived at college near two years after taking his first degree, preparing himself for ihe office of a minister of the gospe,. In 1722 he went to New York, at the request of a small society of English Presbyterians, and preached a number of months. In 1724 he was appointed a tutor in Yale College, and he continued in that office, till he was invited in 1726 to preach in Northampton Massachusetts. Here he was ordained as colleague with his grandfather, the Rev. Mr. Stoddard, Februarv 15, 1727. In 1735 his benevo lent labors were attended with uncommon success; a general impression was made upon the minds of his people by the truths which he proclaimed ; and the church was much enlarged He continued in this place more than twenty three years, till he was \" In August, 1751, he succeeded the Rev.

John Fitch was a native of this town. To this individual belongs the honor of having constructed the first steamboat in this country. Although this honor has so generally been ascribed to Robert Fulton, yet it is a well known fact, that twenty years before the great experi ment of Fulton and Livingston on the Hudson, a steamboat was con structed and put in operation in Philadelphia, under the sole direction of a then obscure and still almost unknown individual. This person was John Fitch. He was born in the south part of East Windsor, near the East Hartford line, on what is now called the old road. He was apprenticed as a watch and clock maker, to Mr. Cheney, who car ried on the business in the eastern part of East Hartford, now Man chester. He married in early life and had two children ; such how ever was the temper and unhappy disposition of his wife, that he left her, and went to New Brunswick, (N. J.) where he set up the busi ness of clock making, engraving, and repairing muskets, before the * Allen's Biographical Dictionary. 11"], [94, "82 EAST WINDSOR. Revolution. When New Jersey was overrun by the British troops, Mr. Fitch removed into the interior of Pennsylvania, where he em- ployed himself in repairing arms for the Continental army. In the year 1785, Mr. Fitch conceived the project of propelling a vessel by the force of condensed vapor. \" When the idea occurred to him, as he himself tells us, he did not know there was such a thing as a steam engine in existence.\" In 1788 he obtained a patent for the application of steam to navigation. By unwearied exertion he succeed- ed in interesting about twenty persons in his plan, and inducing them to take shares of 50 dollars each. A boat was built in 1787. A mile was measured off in Front or Water street, and the boat was found to go at the rate of eight miles an hour. It afterwards went eighty miles in a day. The Governor and Council of Pennsylvania were so much gratified with the experiment, that they presented them with a superb silk flag. About this time the company sent Mr. Fitch lo France, at at the request of Mr. Vail, our Consul at L'Orient, who was one osthe company, and wished to introduce the invention into France. Being in the midst of revolutions in that country, and as no men could be ob- tained for the purpose of building boats, Mr. Fitch returned. \" Mr. Vail afterwards subjected to the examination of Mr. Fulton, when in France, the papers 3nd designs of the steamboat appertaining to the company.\" In 1790, he made an alteration in his boat and she per- formed tolerably well, but still it required further alterations. Mr. Fitch however was not able to obtain the necessary means in order to perfect his invention. The conviction of Fitch respecting the power of steam continued firm. In June, 1792, he addressed a letter to Mr. Rittenhouse, one of the share-holders ; speaking of steam power, be said : \" This, sir, will be the mode of crossing the Atlantic in time, whether I shall bring it to perfection or not He complains of his poverty, and to raise funds, he urges Mr. Rittenhouse to buy his land in Kentucky, that he might have the honor of enabling him to complete the great under taking.\" Upon one occasion he called upon a smith who had worked upon his boat, and after dwelling for some time upon his favorite topic, concluded with these words : \" Well gentlemen, although I shall not live to see the time, you will, when steamboats will be preferred to all other means of conveyance, and especially for passengers, and they will be particularly useful in the navigation of the river Mississippi.\" He retired, when a person present observed, in a tone of deep sympa- thy, \" Poor fellow, what a pity it is he is crazy.\" \" The distress of mind and mortification he suffered from the failure of his protracted ex- ertions and his poverty were too much for him, and to drown his re- flections, he had recourse to the common but deceptive remedy, strong drink, in which he indulged to excess, and retiring to Pittsburg, he ended his days by plunging into the Alleghany.\"* He had filled sev- eral small MS. books with personal and general narrative, more or less connected with his great scheme, and which he bequeathed to the Phil- adelphia Library, with the proviso that they were to remain closed for * American Ed. Edinburgh Encyclopedia."], [95, "83 ENFIELD. thirty years. The books were opened in due time, and were found to contain a minute account of his perplexities and disappointments. \" Of the boldness of his conceptions,\" (says a writer in the Mechanics' Mag azine Jan. 1836,) \" and the perseverance with which he followed it up, there can be but one opinion ; and had fortune attended his efforts, and his means been equal to the accomplishment of his designs, there can be no doubt that he would now hold undisputed the honor of hav ing given to the country this most noble and useful invention.\" The accompanying engraving conveys a correct idea of Mr. Fitch's boat as originally planned ; but in the one actually constructed, he so far modi fied this plan as to place the paddles of the boat astern. Oliver Wolcott, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was the son of Gov. Roger Wolcott, who resided in this town. He was born Nov. 26, 1726, and died at Litchfield in 1797. (See account of Litchfield.) Erastus Wolcott, brother of the preceding, was born about the year 1723. Although a plain, laboring farmer, with inconsiderable advanta ges as to education, he by the force of his native talents, acquired great influence in public affairs. He was appointed a brigadier general in 1777, and went on an expedition to Peekskill. He was a member of Congress and Judge of the Supreme Court. He died in 1793.

ENFIELD. This town was settled by emigrants from Salem, Mass, in 1681, being at that time a part osthe town of Springfield, in that state. For about seventy years after the settlement of the town, it was subject to the jurisdiction of the colony of Massachusetts, not being annexed to Connecticut until 1752. The town is bounded n. by Longmeadow in Massachusetts, e. by Somers, s. by East Windsor, and w. by Con necticut river, which separates it from Suffield. It is about six miles in length from north to south, and five and a half in breadth. The township is generally of a level surface, and the soil mostly of a light sandy loam, and generally fertile. The first bridge ever built across the Connecticut in this state, was erected in 1808, connecting this"], [96, "84 ENFIELD. town with Suffield. It was supported by six stone piers, resting upon the rocky bed osthe river ; being 1000 feet in length and 30 in width. The whole expense of its construction did not exceed $26,000. In 1832 a new bridge was built here, 70 feet in breadth, upon Mr. Town s plan, at an expense of about $15,000. A large proportion of the dwelling houses in this town are situated upon one street, passing through the tovvn, and running parallel with the river. The plough-making business is prosecuted to a considerable extent in this place. Thompsonville, in Enfield. This village in Enfield, on the bank of Connecticut river, was com menced about seven years since, for the purpose of manufacturing carpet ing. It is 18 miles north of Hartford, 8 miles south of Springfield, Mass, and upwards of a mile from Enfield bridge. The village con tains about 800 inhabitants, of whom about 300 grown persons are em ployed in the factories. One hundred and twenty looms are employed, and eight hundred yards of carpeting manufactured daily. The en graving shows the greater part of the principal street in the village, as you come up from the river and pass to tbe east. The engraving on the next page shows a south view of the Sha ker house of worship, on the right of the print ; the other buildings represented are those connected with the central, or as they are gener ally called, \"The Church family.\" This family, consisting of about one hundred persons, occupy the central part osthe Shaker settlement. The whole number of Shakers in this place is upwards of two hundred, who are divided into six families. The village is about five miles n.e. of the Congregational church in Enfield. The religious tenets of the Shakers must of course necessarily affect the order of their societies, by producing an entire separation of the men from the women, and in this particular exhibit the only species of Protestant monkery in this country. Their buildings are remarkably neat and convenient, and"], [97, "85 ENFIELD. every thing appears a model of neatness and economy. They are simple and plain in their manners ; sober and industrious. The socie- ty in this place was established in 1780. There are perhaps about fifty buildings in the settlement, consisting of dwelling houses, work shops, storehouses, &tc. They possess upwards of one thousand acres of a fine tract of land, in the northeast section of the town, which is under the highest degree of cultivation. Their improvements and at tention to horticulture and gardening have rendered them the subjects of much commendation, and their \" garden seeds\" are justly celebrated. They also carry on various kinds of mechanical business, and their wares are much esteemed, being good and free from deception. They are, for their number, a wealthy and flourishing community. Shaker houses, Enfield. \" About the year 1706, a few of those persons who were known by the appellation of French prophets, went over to England and preached with such zeal and effect, that in a short time they became numerous. They however formed no regular societies, nor established any churches, consequently they were not known as a distinct and visible sect.\" In the year 1747, a number of persons endowed with the same spirit united themselves into a small society, in the neighborhood of Man chester, England, under the ministry of James and Jane Wardley. This society practiced no forms of worship, and adopted no creeds as rules of faith, but gave themselves to be guided, as they believed, entirely by the Spirit of God. \" Sometimes, after sitting awhile in silent medi tation, they were seized with a mighty trembling, with violent agitations of the body, running and walking on the floor, with singing, shouting, and leaping for joy. From these exercises of the body they received the appellation of Shakers, which has been their common name of dis tinction ever since. Although this name was originally given by their enemies in derision, yet they consider il as descriptive of their doctrine and practice, and also in conformity with several passages of the scrip tures, which speak of a shaking of the ' heavens and the earth.'"], [98, "86 ENFIELD. \" This small society continued to increase in number till about the year 1770, when by a special manifestation of divine light, the present testimony of salvation and eternal life was fully revealed to Ann Lee, and by her to the society.\" \"According to the account given by her biographer, she passed through great trial and distress of mind for the space of nine years, du- ring which period the most astonishing visions and divine manifestations were presented to her view, in so clear and striking a manner that the whole spiritual world seemed displayed before her, \u2014 she had a full and clear view of the mystery of iniquity, of the root and foundation of hu- man depravity, and of the very first act of transgression committed by the first man and woman in the garden of Eden. Here she saw whence and wherein all mankind were lost from God, and clearly realized the only possible way of recovery. This revelation she received in the summer of 1770, while in prison, where she was confined on account of her religious principles, under the pretence that she had profaned the Sabbath. From this time, the light and power of God, revealed in Ann, and through her administered to those who received her testimony, had such sensible effect in giving them power over all sin, and filling them with visions and revelations and other gifts of God, that she was readily acknowledged as their spiritual mother in Christ, from which she received the title of Mother Ann.\" This woman, with a few of her followers, emigrated to this country in 1774. In September, 1776, they took up their residence in the woods of Watervliet, where they made a settlement, near Nisqueuna, about seven miles northwest from Albany. She died at this place in 1784. The following is from a book entitled \" Christ's Second Appear ing ;\" it is extracted from a poem, called \" A memorial to mother Ann,\" and will serve to show in what light she is viewed by her followers. Let names, and seels and parties, no longer be rever'd, Since in the name of mother, salvation halh appeared: Appointed by kind Heaven the Saviour to reveal, Her doctrine is confirmed with an eternal seal. At Manchester in England, this burning truth began, When Christ made his appearance in blessed Mother Ann; A few at first received it and did their lust forsake, And soon their testimony brought on a mighty shake. For Mother's safe protection, good angels flew before, Towards Ihe land of promise, Columbia's happy shore; Hail thou victorious Gospel, and lhat auspicious day, When Mother safely landed in North America. About four years she labored with the attentive throng, While all their sins they open'd and righled ev'ry wrong. At length she closed her labors and vanish'd out of sight, And left her faithful children increasing in the light. How much they are mistaken who think that Mother's dead, When through her ministrations so many souls are fed! In union with the Father, she is the second Eve, Dispensing full salvation to all who do believe. ' The leading characteristic in the worship of this people, is their dan cing. This they describe as the involuntary result of the exhilarating"], [99, "ENFIELD. 87 and overpowering delight received through the outpouring of divine grace upon their hearts. The evolutions and changes in the dance, by constant practice, become as precisely correct as the maneuvers of a regiment of experienced soldiers ; it becomes in fact a mechanical move ment. No one ever makes a mistake, or throws the rank in disorder from inattention or inexperience ; but every thing is conducted in the most exact order, as if every step and movement of the body was di rected by a gage and rule. Dances are sometimes held in private houses, when variations are frequently introduced. On some occasions it is said their movements are so rapid, that the eye can scarce follow or keep pace with their swift motions. Shakers dancing. \"The principal doctrines osthe Shakers are, \u2014 a belief in the second appearance of Christ, in the person of the holy mother. They admit of but two persons in the Godhead, God the Father, and God the Moth- er, which they say is according to the order of nature, being male and female. To redeem the depraved race of man, they believe that it be- came necessary for God to take upon him the real character of human nature as it is, male and female, and that his first appearance was in the person of man, and the second in the person of woman, whereby the work of redemption was finished and completed. The confusion and wickedness that prevailed in the Catholic Church, during the long pe- riod which preceded and followed the reformation, they ascribe to the work of redemption not being completed in Christ's first appearance, it being the necessary period that must intervene between the making and fulfillment of the promise of Christ, that he would establish his law of righteousness on earth. They believe in perfect holiness, and insist that salvation from sin here is necessary to salvation from misery hereafter. They regard the Bible as a testimony of Christ's first appearance, but deny that it contains the word of God, or of life, as they consider a be-"], [100, "88 FARMINGTON. lies in the second appearance of Christ, or in the spiritual character and mission of the holy mother, as indispensable to salvation.

The first settlers of Farmington were from Hartford, being emigrants from Boston, Newtown and Roxbury. in Massachusetts. They began the settlement in 1640, being probably attracted at this early period by the fine natural meadows upon the Tunxis or Farmington river. The town was incorporated in 1645. The land was purchased of the Tunxis tribe of Indians, which was a numerous and warlike tribe, by eighty four proprietors, and divided by them and their heirs according to their res pective interests. The township at the time of its incorporation was about fifteen miles square.* Since this period five new towns have been formed from it, viz. Southington, Berlin, Bristol, Burlington and Avon. The present length of Farmington is 7| miles from north to south, and averages upwards of four in breadth. The town is situated principally between two mountainous ridges which stretch from n. n. e. to s. s. w. indented by vallies ; the mean distance between the moun tains is about four miles. The east mountain, on the base of which the village is built, presents a mural front to the west, and has two con venient passes through it ; the road to Hartford passing through the north, and the road to Middletown through the south pass, distant from each other about four miles. The Farmington river, about 45 yards * Pease and Niles's Gazetteer."], [101, "FARMINGTON. 89 wide, enters through the west mountain from the northwest, and runs southeast to the central part osthe town, where meeting the east moun tain, it turns an acute angle and runs northward through the town, par allel with the mountain. On the east side osthe east mountain, oppo site a peak called Rattlesnake hill, rises the Quinnipiac or North Haven river. The great flat or natural meadow, from the river westward, from 1| to 2 miles broad, is alluvial, a rich loam and sand, and is one osthe 2 ._ ._ , ... \u2014 most fertile tracts in the State. JV. W. view of Farmington, from Round Hill. The above is a view of the central part of the village, showing the Congregational and Methodist churches. The main street, on which they are built, extends about two miles from north to south, on an ele vated plain from 50 to 75 feet above the level osthe river, the course of which is seen by the row of trees standing below the level of the houses. The New Haven and Northampton canal passes between the river and the houses, its course being elevated above the level of the river. There are about one hundred handsome dwelling houses within the limits of something more than a mile, some of which are elegant edifices. The Academy in the village, and the Methodist church, (recently erected,) both stand near the Congregational church. \u2014 The above view was taken from Round Hill, a singular elevation in the meadows, about half a mile distant from the main street. This hill is a natural curios ity; it covers about 12 acres; it rises abruptly to the height of about 60 feet, and is nearly circular in its form. It was once probably an island in the center of a lake, which covered the whole of the present meadow.* At the first settlement of the town, Round Hill was fixed * These meadows are now occasionallyoverflowed. During the freshet, Feb. 14th, 1807, a cry of distress was heard by some persons on the bank osthe river. Pomeroy Strong and George Treadwell, went about live o'clock P.

They proceeded to Round Hill, where they heard the cries of a man named Bebe, to the northwest, where they found a span of horses and part ofa wagon, and a 12"], [102, "90 FARMINGTON. on as a central point of departure in all measurements in laying out the divisions of land. The town is bounded n. by Avon, e. by Hartford and Berlin, w. by Bristol and Burlington, and s. by Soutbington. The central part is 10 miles west from Hartford. \"The number of inhabitants is 2000, and has not varied much within the last thirty years.\" The first minister in this place was Roger Newton, settled in 1647-8, who officiated nine years, and then removed to Milford. The second was Samuel Hooker, who was ordained in )658, and died in 1697. Samuel Whitman was ordained the next minister, in 1706. He offi ciated 45 years, and died in 1751. The next year Timothy Pitkin, from East Hartford, was ordained ; he officiated till 1785, and was then dismissed at his own request. He was succeeded by Allen Olcott, in 1787, who in 1795 was succeeded by Joseph Washburn. This town has at present a school fund, besides what is received from the State, amounting to nearly $10,000, the annual interest of which is applied to the payment of teachers. In 1695\u20146 the town voted a certain sum for the support ofa teacher for half the year, and in the di rections to the committee for procuring one, a clause was added, \" that he should be so gifted as to be able occasionally to step into the pulpit.\" \"The native Indians must have been very numerous, in and about the town, when the first settlers arrived. The hunting grounds and fishing places, were peculiarly attractive. Their burying grounds were on two sandy hills, one on the west side of the great meadow, and one on the east, and near the center of the present village. In excavating the canal, many of their bones were discovered, and some domestic articles, as cups, Sic. In 1691 a committee was chosen by the town to designate houses to be fortified against them. It appears that seven such houses were used for that purpose. The doors were made of double plank, united by nails driven closely together, so as to prevent their being cut through with hatchets. In 1763 the number of Indians was about 100, a considerable number having previously removed in a body to Stockbridge, Mass., and another division of them have since removed to the same place.\" man by the name of Atwater, in a bunch of willows, in the middle of a current, about two rods from the shore ; with a good deal of difficulty they got Atwater into the ca noe. As they were passing a tree, Atwater in a fright seized one of the branches ; in doing this he overset the boat. He succeeded in climbing the tree, while the others swam to the hill, where they called for help. About 9 o'clock, Dr. Eli Todd, William Hill and Joel Warner manned a canoe, and alternately drawing and navigating it, reached the hill. After a number of attempts to relieve Atwater, a bridge of ice was iormed from the tree to the shore, on which he was enabled to pass. Todd, Hill and Warner sailed in tbe course of the road northwest, in search of Bebe ; they found the currents so rapid that they were obliged to return without effecting their object though they came within speaking distance, and exhorted him to be silent through the ni^ht except when they should call to him ; his cries before had been distinctly heard through the town for nearly three miles in length: he remained on a cake of ice about two rods m length, through the night.

Glastenbury was incorporated as a town in 1690 ; it was previously included within the limits of Wethersfield. It is bounded s. by East Hartford and Manchester, e. by Hebron and Bolton, s. by Chatham and Marlborough, and w. by Connecticut river and Wethersfield.* Its length from east to west averages about nine miles, being about six in breadth. There are some fine meadows upon the borders of the Con necticut, back of which, upon the rise of land, the soil is a sandy loam, generally fertile and productive. In Eastbury, the east society in the town, the lands to a considerable extent are rough and stony. There are five houses of worship, 2 Congregational, 2 Methodist and 1 Epis copal. The population in 1810 was 2,776 ; in 1830, it was 2,980. Glastenbury was originally purchased by the proprietors from the In dians. The deed from the chief, granted a certain number of rods in width north and south, \" butting on the Great River, and running three miles into the wilderness.\" These lots have many of them presented the same general features to this day, although subdivided among de scendants and purchasers, until some of them are only eight rods wide, though three miles long. The principal proprietors and first settlers were of the names of Welles, Wyllis, Hale, Kimberly, Hollister, Smith and Talcott. Thaddeus Welles, Esq. now resides upon the land which his ancestor, Thomas Welles, purchased of Sowheag, the great sachem at Middletown. These lands have descended from father to son, and have never been out of the possession of the family for almost two hun dred years. Samuel Welles, the celebrated banker of Paris, and the late Gen. Arnold Welles, son-in-law of Gen. Warren, who fell on Bun ker Hill, were of the same family, and very recently owned another tract purchased by the same ancestor. About the year 1690, the Legislature gave permission to all the in habitants of that part of Wethersfield, lying east of Connecticut river, to associate together and be invested with town privileges, \" so soon as they could procure and settle a good orthodox minister.\" The Rev. Timothy Stephens was ordained their first minister in October, 1693. Mr. Stephens appears to have died in 1725, at the age of 60. \u2014 An old house is now standing in the town, upwards of half a mile north of the Congregational church, called the \"Talcott house,\" and is believed to be one of the oldest in the State. It was formerly stockaded, and it is said to have been once attacked by the Indians \u2014 marks of the as sault are stated to be still seen. This house belongs to Col. Talcott, of the U. S. Army, superintendent of the U. S. Arsenal at Watervliet, N. Y., and has been in possession of the family about one hundred and fifty years. * A small tract within the bounds ofGlastenbury lies on the west side of Connecti cut river; the cause of this willbe explained in the account of Wethersfield,"], [104, "92 GLASTENBURY. Cotton Factory village, Glastenbury. ' The above is a western view of the village connected with the Hart ford Manufacturing Co. This site is admirably situated for manufactur ing purposes. Roaring Brook here passes through a very narrow de file: the first dam above the factories has a fall of 50 feet, and the low er dam 24 feet ; taken together these are believed to be the highest falls in New England used for manufacturing purposes. This establishment has 5,200 spindles and 135 looms in operation ; 130 girls and 40 men and boys are employed. The village is situated about half a mile eastward of the main road to Chatham, 8\u00a3 miles from Hartford, about 1\u00a3 miles from Connecticut river, and 8 miles from Chatham quarry. There was formerly a powder mill in this place, one of the first ever built in this country : this was blown up in 1777 and five persons killed. The first appearance of this village strikes the traveler with an agreea ble surprise : considering the general face of the land in this section of the town, he is not prepared to find in such a short distance from the main road, such a romantic and beautiful specimen of interesting scene ry. \u2014 From some of the eastern hills in this town, are some of the most delightful prospects to be seen in the State. The view embraces the whole valley of the Connecticut \u2014 from where it enters the highlands in South Glastenbury to Mount Tom in Massachusetts, including Hartford and all the intervening towns. \" In the eastern part of the town, there is a pond of about a mile in circumference, called ' Diamond pond,' from the circumstance of there being small pebbles or stones around its margin, having a peculiar bril liancy. Near the center of the town, there is a mineral spring, which though it has acquired no celebrity abroad, has been thought by men of science who have examined it, to possess valuable medicinal quali ties ; and for more than one hundred years has been known by the name of the ' Pool at Neipseic'"], [105, "GRANBY. 93 There were several seats of the Indians in Glastenbury, and this tract was considered fine hunting and fishing ground. They were all tribu tary to Sowheag, who was tributary to the Pequots, or in alliance with them, and they mustered their warriors in aid of the quarrels of that powerful tribe. The north part of Glastenbury was called the plains of Hanahbuke ; the south part, Naog ; and on the line of Chatham and Glastenbury were the meadows and hills of Wongung ; in the southeastern part is the valley of Wasuc. Near the center of the town are the high hills and the celebrated pool at Neipseic ; still farther east and to the northeast are the higher peaks of Houksetl and Minachaug.

GRANBY. Granby is an extensive irregular township, situated in the northern section of Hartford County. It was incorporated as a town in 1786, previous to which it was a part of Simsbury. It is bounded n. by the Massachusetts line, e. by Suffield and Windsor, s. by Simsbury and Canton, and w. by Barkhamsted and Hartland. The average length of the township from east to west is 9J miles : the breadth from north to south averages more than 6 miles. There are two societies in this town, Turkey Hills and Salmon Brook. Turkey Hills is said to have derived its name from the numerous flocks of wild turkeys which for merly used to range this part of the town. Salmon Brook (the west ern part of the town) derived its name from a brook of that name, passing through this section, in which salmon formerly used to be taken. There are 5 houses of worship in this town ; 2 Congregational, 1 Epis copal, 1 Methodist, and 1 Universalist. Salmon Brook, which is 14 miles from Hartford and 3 from the old prison buildings, is perhaps the largest village. In this place is the Episcopal church, and about twenty or thirty dwelling houses in the vicinity."], [106, "94 GRANBY. Different appearances of minerals have been discovered in the green stone mountains and hills of this town. The cavern, which was once occupied by the State as a prison-, is now opened and worked as a mine by the \" Ph\u0153nix Mining Company,\" incorporated by the Legislature of Connecticut in 1830. South view of Newgate Prison Buildings. This place, formerly the State Prison of Connecticut, is sixteen miles from Hartford : the spires osthe churches in the city can be easily seen from the prison buildings. It is two and a half miles east of the New Haven and Northampton Canal, and four or five miles westward of Con necticut river. The buildings are situated on the western declivity ofa range of mountains which extend southerly to New Haven, terminating at the East Rock near that place. A range of lofty, precipitous and craggy rocks rises immediately east osthe Prison ; on the west extensive val leys are seen, with mountains presenting irregular outlines in the distance. The appearance of this place forcibly reminds the observer of the walls, castles and towers erected for the security of some haughty lord ling of the feudal ages ; while the gloomy dungeons within its walls call to remembrance a Bastile, the prisons of the Inquisition, and other en gines of oppression and tyranny. The lands upon which this prison stands, and in the vicinity, were claimed by the original proprietors of the town, in which they were once situated ; but on account of their supposed value from the copper ore which had been found, and as gold was supposed to abound in the mine, it caused a contention about the title, which was long continued. To quiet this, the General Assembly in 1753, appointed a committee to investigate the subject, and confirmed the right and title osthe original proprietors, and set off to them the land or mine. At this time copper ore had been found ; the ore was considered very rich, and it was also supposed that it contained gold. From these circumstances, the fame"], [107, "95 GRANBY. of these mines soon reached Europe, and a company was formed in England in 1760 for the purpose of working them ; soon after a number of persons in the employ of this company arrived from England for this purpose. But the company was obliged principally to employ men who resided in the neighborhood, who were not acquainted with the business ; from which circumstance and others, the work proceeded slowly, and with great difficulty. The company, however, was ena bled to freight two vessels with ore, (as they did not calculate to work the ore here, but in England ;) these vessels were both lost \u2014 one was taken by the French, and the other sunk in the Channel. These losses were so great, and the whole business having been little more than a continuation of disasters and sacrifices, the company became discoura ged and abandoned the undertaking. The miners, in digging and ex ploring, sunk numerous wells or deep excavations. The principal one was upon Copper hill, so called, and is now remaining within the walls of ihe prison. These caverns were first occupied as a place of confine ment about the time of the Revolutionary war. There being at that time no prison in the state besides the county gaols, and the number of convicts increasing, arrangements were made for occupying these cav erns as a place of confinement, but no permanent buildings were at this time erected ; it is not probable that at first it was contemplated to convert these caverns into a state prison ; their occupation for this purpose was regarded as a temporary thing. The confining of con victs having begun, it was continued ; and this being found inconven ient, the General Assembly in 1790 passed an act, establishing Newgate prison as a permanent state prison, and provided for the erection of suitable buildings. The following is from Kendall's travels in the northern parts of the United States. He visited Newgate prison in 1807. \" On being admitted into the gaol yard, I found a sentry under arms within the gate, and eight soldiers drawn up in a line in front of the gaoler's house. A bell summon ing the prisoners to work had already rung; and in a few moments they began lo make their appearance. They came in irregular numbers, sometimes two or three together, and somelimes a single one alone ; but whenever one or more were about to cross the yard to the smitheiy, the soldiers were ordered to present, in readiness to fire. The prisoners were heavily ironed, and secured both by handcuffs and setters ; and being therefore unable to walk, could only make their way by a sort of jump or a hop. On entering the smilhery, some went to the sides of the forges, where collars, dependent by iron chains from ihe roof, were fastened round their necks, and others were chained in pairs to wheelbarrows. The number of prisoners was about forty; and when they were all disposed of in the manner described, sentries were placed within the buildings which contained them. After viewing thus lar Ihe economy of this prison, I left it, proposing to visit the cells at a later hour. \" This establishment, as 1 have said, is designed to be, from all its arrangements, an object of terror ; and every thing is accordingly contrived, to make the life endured in it as burdensome and miserable aspossible. In conformity with this idea, the place chosen for the prison is no other than the mouth ofa forsaken copper mine, of which the excavations are employed as cells. They are descended by a shaft, which is secured by a trap door, within the prison house, or gaoler's house, which stands upon the mine. \" The trap door being lifted up, I went down an iron ladder, perpendicularly fixed, to the depth of about fifty feet. From the foot osthe ladder a rough, narrow, and low passage descends still deeper, till it terminates at a well of clear water, over which is an air shaft, seventy feet in height, and guarded at its mouth, which is within the gaol yard, by a hatch of iron. The cells are near the well, but at different depths beneath the surface, none perhaps exceeding sixty feet. They are small, rugged, and accom modated with wooden berths, and some straw. The straw was wet, and there was much humidity in every part of this obscure region; but I was assured I ought to at-"], [108, "96 GRANBY. tiibute this only to the remarkable wetness of she season ; that the cells \u00bb ere 1 g ral dry, and that they were not found unfavorable to the health ot the pri j\u00bbone . \" Into these cells the prisoners are dismissed at four o'clock m the f*\u2122\u2122\"'s*\">. day without exception, and at all seasons of the year. They descend in their t. and handcuffs, and at four o'clock in the morning they ascend the iron waaei, ci ing it as well as they can by the aid of their fettered limbs. It is to be Vose\" e\u00ab \"\"^ :\u00b0 , women are confined here; the law providing that female convicts, guilty 01 c imes u which men are to be confined in Newgate prison, are to be sent only to the counts 6oais. \" Going again into the workshop or smilhery, I found the attendants ot the prison delivering pickled pork for the dinner of the prisoners. Pieces were given separately to the parlies at each forge. They were thrown upon the floor, and left to be : wasneu and boiled in the water \"used for cooling the iron wrought at the forges. Meat baa been distributed in like manner for breakfast. The food of the prison is regulated for each day in the week; and consists in an alternation of pork, beef, and peas, with which last no flesh meat is allowed. Besides the caverns or excavations below, ana the gaoler's house above, there are other apartments prepared for the prisoners, ana particularly a hospital, of which the neatness and airiness afford a strong contrast to the other parts of the prison. It was also satisfactory lo find that in this hospital there -were no sick. . . \" Such is the seat and the scene of punishment provided by Connecticut for crimin- als not guilty of murder, treason, or either of a few other capital offences. What judgment the reader will pass upon it I do not venture to anticipate ; but for myselt, I cannot get rid osthe impression, that without any extraordinary cruelty in its actual operation, there is something very like cruelty in the device and design.\" In the southwestern part osthe town are two remarkable hills, called Barn door hills, which rise to an elevation of four or five hundred feet. These hills have the appearance of having been separated by some vi olent convulsion of nature, as the two sides correspond with each other. A road about half a mile in extent passes through the chasm now sepa rating these two hills. Were this chasm closed up by bringing the hills together, the hill or mountain would present the appearance of a cone. If we were to credit but a small proportion of what has been related and believed by many persons to be true, this town has been the theater of the most extraordinary transactions. It is stated that about ten or twelve years since, in the west part osthe town, in an old house near the Hartland line, the crying of a child, and many other unusual noises, were many times distinctly heard by persons who were in the house, although there was no child near, nor was there any apparent cause for any noise to be heard in the vicinity. Sometimes the crying of the child was very loud and distinct, and appeared to be but a few feet from the persons who heard it. (It ought to be mentioned, that in this house a foul crime is supposed to have been perpetrated.) Two young men, who were possessed of the usual share of courage, supposing the whole to be a kind of \" ghost story,\" determined to sleep all night in the room where these noises were heard, and find out, if possible, the cause. Some time after they had gone to bed, in the dead osthe night, some thing appeared to come with a kind of gust against the house ; then something appeared to rush through the window, although nothing was seen ; next the chairs were thrown about in great disorder, next there was a noise heard at the fire-place with the shovel and ton\u00b0-s, although there were none in the room, and finally the noise appeared to go off down the ash-hole. Some forty or fifty years since a number of fami lies in the West society were affected in a strange and unaccountable manner. The persons composing these families would often run about like persons distracted ; and according to their statements, heard strange noises, saw spirits in the air, &c."], [109, "HARTLAND. 97 HARTLAND. Hartland is an elevated township, 22 miles from Hartford, bounded n. by the Massachusetts line, e. by Granby, w. by Colebrook and s. by Barkhamsted, and is about 7 miles in length and 5 in breadth. This town is hilly and mountainous, being embraced within the extensive range of granite in this part of the State. From its elevated situation it is cold and frosty, and the soil rather sterile, producing but little grain ; it however affords tolerable gtazing. The making of butter and cheese, beef and pork, and pasturing of cattle are the principal kinds of business done in the town. The farmers in the east of this lo Connec- ticut river, have been in the practice of sending their growing or young cattle and sheep into this and other grazing towns, to be kept during several months in the spring and summer. The town is divided into two parts, one called East, the other West Hartland, in each of which is a Congregational church ; there is also a Methodist church in the limits of the town. The town is centially divided by the east branch of the Farmington river, on which are sev eral small tracts of alluvial, and excellent mill seats. The deep ravine or valley through which this stream passes is called Hartland hollow, and is characterized by bold, rough, and picturesque scenery. Hartland is one of the towns sold by the State to the inhabitants of Hartford and Windsor. The first proprietors' meeting was holden in Hartford in 1733. The first person who lived in the town was John Kendall, who being in debt, (led from Granby, and to get out osthe way of his creditors, located himself in Hartland Hollow, on the west bank osthe branch osthe Farmington river ; here he made himself a hut with slabs which floated down the stream from Granville, Mass. \u2014 this was in 1753. While here Kendall's wife bore a pair of twin daughters, the first white children born in the town. Kendall stayed in the town about one year. In 1755, Simon Baxter came into this town. He was con sidered a person of suspicious character. In the Revolution he joined the army of Burgoyne, and finally died at Halifax. Hartland was incorporated as a town in 1761, at which time it belong ed to Litchfield County. In 1768, the Rev. Sterling Graves was or dained, being the first minister in the town. He was ordained in the open air, on a knoll about a mile south of the present Congregational church in East Hartland. The first meeting house was erected in 1770. In West Hartland, the first minister was the Rev. Nathaniel Gaylord, who settled there about 1782. Mr, Gaylord is still living, and preaches occasionally. Hartland, Litchfield County, Jan. 19, 1796. There is now living in this town, one Mr. Jonas Wilder, in the 97th year ofhis age, and is a steady, industrious man, seldom losing one day in a month by reason of infir mity and old age ; he was one osthe first settlers in said town, and has in this town lived near 36 years ; he was then the oldest person that ever lived in said town and ever since has been, and still remains, the oldest person by several years. He has had two wives and both of one name, both christian and maiden, the last of which he hath lived with about 65 years ; he has had 12 children and never lost one ; his eldest child is now in the 73d year of his age, the youngest in his 47th. His sons, though but seven in number, have sustained the following honorable offices, beside town and society 13"], [110, "98 MANCHESTER. offices, viz. one Colonel, one Major, one Captain, two Lieutenants, three Justices o the Peace, three Representatives, and three Deacons. , , \u2022\u25a0 His posterity was numbered in 1773, and found to be 232, of which he had lost only 16, and how many hath increased since then is unknown, as two lived near cosiuu, two at Upper Coos, and three at Genesee. \u2014 Conn.

MANCHESTER. Manchester was incorporated as a township in 1823. It was for merly called Orford, the East parish in East Hartford. It is nearly six miles in length, and about the same in breadth, bounded n. by East Windsor and Vernon, e. by Bolton and Vernon, w. by East Hartford, and s. by Glastenbury. The surface of the town is somewhat broken and hilly ; il has a mixed soil of sand, loam and gravel, and is generally fertile. In the western part of it, there is a range of red sandstone, ex tending through the town ; this stone generally lies under the surface, and being ofa soft texture is easily worked, and is valuable for under pinning, hearth and step stones. The township is watered by the Hock anum and its branches, upon which are situated numerous mills and manufactories, among which are six or seven paper mills, one woolen end one satinet factory, and two powder mills. The cut on the next page is an eastern view of the churches in Man chester. They stand on a light sandy plain, about 8 miles from Hartford. The Methodist church is the first building seen on the right, the one beyond is the Congregational church. There are three principal set tlements in the town, in each of which is a post office: Woodbridge's, near the centre, Buckland's corner, and a collection of houses in the northeast part of the town, in the vicinity oftheLTnion Factory. \" Tbe first cotton mill that was successfully put in operation in Con necticut, was erected within the present limits of this town in 1794, and owned by Messrs. Samuel Pitkin & Co. Velvets, corduroys, fus tians, were manufactured at this establishment in considerable quanti ties, at that early period. The machinery was made by a native of England, and upon the principles introduced by Arkwright. Efforts all osthe same nature had been before attempted in the State, but were unsuccessful. The business was regarded as a mystery, difficult of ac- quisition, and as an experiment hazardous to the undertakers. But one cotton mill was in operation in the country at this time, and that at Providence, and owned by Messrs. Ailing & Brown and Samuel"], [111, "marlborough. 99 Methodist and Congregational Churches, Manchester. Slater. A mill was soon afterwards erected at Patterson, N. J. Com paratively little progress was made in extending the cotton manufacture until about 1804, since which it has experienced many vicissitudes, and had to encounter great difficulties. The business was flourishing dur ing the war, but from the vast and alarming influx of goods after the peace, became greatly depressed. New companies, however, were formed upon the passage osthe tariff of 1816, and additional capital in vested in the business, and the mills, which had discontinued their ope rations and were suffered to decay, were repaired and put in operation, many of them having been transferred to other hands.\" In the vicinity of the two churches, (seen above,) in 1751, Mr. Thomas Kennedy and a young man were buried alive by the caving in ofa well 53 feet in depth. Mr. Kennedy, who descended from motives of curiosity, found the eanh caving in about him. Having called for help, a rope attached to a windlass was let down, and be was directed to tie it around his body under his arms. This method of extricating him was found ineffectual. In the hurry osthe moment, a young man descended the well in order to cut the rope. A large slone now caved in, followed by a mass of sand, which covered bolh, and they were instantly suffocated. An order was obtained from Gov. Law, who resided at Milfoid, to raise assistance to disinter the bodies. Ten days had elapsed before they were dug out. MARLBOROUGH. This town is situated in the southeastern extremity of Hartford County. It was incorporated in 1803, being formed from Colchester, Glastenbury and Hebron, three towns which belonged to three differ ent counties. The township is irregular in its form, having an average length of five and a half miles, and an average breadth of four miles, bounded n. by Glastenbury, e. by Hebron, s. by Colchester, and w. by Chatham. The surface of the town is hilly and stony, and the lands best adapted for grazing. Marlborough pond, in this town, is a con-"], [112, "100 SIMSBURY. siderable body of water, being one mile in length and half a mile in breadth. Black lead has been found in this town. There is one house of worship in the town, which is osthe Congregational order. The most compact settlement in the town is around the Lnion Cot ton Factory, which is 14 miles from Hartford and one mile northerly from the Congregational church. The number of inhabitants in 1810 was 720; in 1830 the population was 704. The first settlement in the town was commenced in the south part, by persons by the name of Foot and Carrier, who were from Colches ter: these settlers located themselves between two and three miles south osthe meeting house. The tradition is, that the first person who located himself in the limits of the town was Mr. Carrier, who con structed a kind of log hut on the land now owned by Mr. Gelston. Carrier, who came up from Colchester to make a clearing for a settle ment, having got detained from some cause, was obliged to stay in his hut over night, and was attacked by a party of Indians, eight or ten in number. Carrier, who was a strong athletic man, defended himself with such effect that he killed nearly the whole number with his axe, as they attempted to force themselves into his cabin. The New London and Hartford turnpike passes through the center of this town. After ascending the mountain which forms the eastern boundary of the valley osthe Connecticut, about twelve miles from Hart ford, the road passes through what is called \" the dark hollow.\" This place is on the mountain, near the western boundary of Marlborough. Large masses of rocks are thrown about in great disorder, giving the place a wild and savage aspect. In the vicinity of this place, westerly from the turnpike, an English gentleman, it is said, who had married the daughter of one of the governors of Connecticut, resided for some time with his family, at the period of the first settlement of the country. SIMSBURY. The ancient name of Simsbury was Massacoe. The land was pur chased of the Indians, and settlements began under the town of Wind sor, of which it was then considered as part. In the session of the General Court, May, 1670, it was enacted, that Massacoe should be a distinct town, by the name of Simsbury ; the limits granted were ten miles northward from the north bounds of Farmington, and ten miles westward from the western bounds of Windsor. About six years after the settlement, the inhabitants, numbering about forty families, were so alarmed at the hostility of the Indians, that they buried their effects and went back to Windsor. The settlement being deserted, the Indians destroyed the houses which had been erected, by burning them, and blotted out almost every vestige of improvement which distinguished the new born settlement from the surrounding wilderness ; so that when the settlers returned, they could not find the place where their goods"], [113, "simsbury. 101 were secreted. This was in the spring of 1676, at which time Sims bury was a frontier settlement, although but about ten miles from Con necticut river. This township is seven miles in length, and about five and a half miles in breadth, upon an average estimate. It is bounded N. by Granby, e. by Windsor and Bloomfield, s. by Avon, and w. by Canton. It is strikingly diversified, being intersected by the Farmington river, and embracing the range of the greenstone mountain, which here is elevated and lofty. The New Haven and Northampton Canal passes through this town, running parallel with the river. South view of Tariffville, in isimsbury. Tariffville, a flourishing village, is situated at the northeastern ex tremity of this town, on the west bank of the Farmington river, which at this place passes south, at the base of a range of mountains, which divides this part of the State from the great valley of Connecticut river. The accompanying view shows the appearance of the village from the heights which rise immediately south. The river passes between the buildings represented and the precipitous heights seen on the right in the engraving. There is in the village a post office, called the Tariff ville post office, and two taverns, both of which are seen in the engrav ing; one is seen on the extreme left, the other south of the Stone Fac tory, (the building with a cupola,) before which a large tree is standing in the street. This place is a carpet manufacturing village, owned prin cipally by a company called the \" New England Carpet Company ;\" they employ 175 hands, and manufacture yearly about 132,000 yards of carpeting. This flourishing village is between three and four miles south of Newgate or Simsbury mines, near the New Haven and North ampton Canal, and twelve miles from Hartford. The following extracts are from a publication entitled \" the History of my own times,\" by the Rev. Daniel Barber, A. M. printed at Wash ington, 1827."], [114, "102 SIMSBURY. \" In the commencement of Philip's war in New England, in 1675, ? this town (Simsbury) was burnt by the Indians. Connected with which event, current tradition has preserved and handed down the following singular and extraordinary fact : that, very shortly before this attack by the Indians, early one Sunday morning, as Lieut. Robe's father was walking over the plain not from his house, he very plainly and dis- tinctly heard the report of a small arm, which much surprised him, it being the Sabbath. He found on returning to his house, that his fam- ily also heard it. On going to meeting, at which the inhabitants from all parts of the town were assembled, it was ascertained that the report was heard at the same hour in every quarter. It was, on further exam- ination, found to have been heard as far south as Saybrook, (fifty miles,) and as far north as Northsielrl, at that time the extent of the English settlements to the north. The report of this gun alarmed all Connec- ticut. The Governor summoned a council of war to meet at Hartford ; and the council issued an order for the inhabitants of Simsbury, one and all, immediately to withdraw themselves to Hartford, the then cap- ital. This order was punctually obeyed. The fearful apprehension of being suddenly murdered by savages, put in motion, and hastened along, whole bands of women and children, with men in the rear, with sheep, cattle, and such utensils and conveniences as their short notice and hasty flight would permit. Hartford was twelve miles distant. Their heavy articles, such as pots, kettles, and plough irons, were secreted in the bottoms of swamps and wells. \" The father of the first Governor Wolcott and his family, were among those who fled from Simsbury. Old Mr. Wolcott filled up a large brass kettle with his pewter cups, basins, platters, ike. and then sunk the kettle with its contents in the deep mud of the swamp, but was never able to find it afterwards. \" After the inhabitants had spent a day or two in their retreat, the men under arms were sent back, for the purpose of looking about and making discoveries. They came to the highest eminenece in the road east of Simsbury river, from which, at one view, they could take a sur vey of the principal part of their habitations, which, to their surprise and sorrow, were become a desolation, and every house burnt to ashes. They saw no Indians, but plenty of Indian tracks and trajls in the sand. \" I have recorded the story as a matter of fact, having very often heard it related as such in my infant years, and also from the children of those who were both witnesses and personal sufferers. \" My father's name was Daniel Barber. He was the son of Sergeant Thomas Barber, who was the grandson of Lieut. Thomas Barber, who commanded under Captain Westover, in the first military company in said Simsbury. He was one of the original proprietors of that town ship, as appears from his name being still on the original charter. It is also reported of him, that at a time when the savages were surrounding the town with a determination to destroy its inhabitants in the darkness of the night, that by means of his military skill and sagacity, he pre vented their attack ; that the next morning, the wind being fair, he as cended the roof of his house, in the place called Hop Meadow, and"], [115, "SIMSBURY. 103 beat an alarm on his drum. The beat was heard and understood at Windsor, seven or eight miles off. The militia took the alarm, and a company under arms made their appearance in the afternoon at Sims bury.\" The following is from Mr. Barber's pamphlet from which the prece ding was taken. \" Immediately after the battle of Bunker's Hill, in 1775, orders were issued for raising a regimens of Connecticut troops, for the term of five months, under Colonel Jede\" diah Huntington, of Norwich. I enlisted under Captain Elihu Humphrey, of Sims bury. My other officers were Lieut. Andrew Hilyer, Lieut. Ebenezer Fitch Bissel, and Ensign Stoughton ; all of whom are men of character and reputation. Captain Elihu, as we generally called him, was the son osthe Hon. John Humphrey, formerly one of the Governor's council, and a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas for the County of Hartford. Captain Elihu was a well bred gentleman ; his friendly turn of mind, with a sweetness of disposition, secured him the love of all good men; his confidence and esteem procured him ihe commission of Major, in the second cam paign. He dying about the close of the year 1776, left, as a legacy to his family, a name, whose reputation will not be forgotten duting many generations. I knew him \u2014 I revered him \u2014 and I loved him. Lieut. Hilyer, (now Col. Hilyer,) was also of Simsbury. He was a handsome sprightly young gentleman, who had in early life re ceived a college education. As an officer, his manner was unassuming, gentle and persuasive. Whenever he spoke, the soldiers heard him wilh pleasure, and whatever was his will was cheerfully complied with. E. Fitch Bissel, of Windsor, was second lieutenant. He was a gentleman, though not of the most easy and familiar turn ; yel, for his steady, correct attention to the duties of his station, was well respected. I think he was advanced to a captainship Ihe next year. He died many years ago. Of En sign Stoughton, 1 remember but little. Sickness detained him long out of camp. He was a tall well made man, and possessed a good military appearance. He was also from Old Windsor. The sergeants in this company were, Aaron Pinney, Jacob Tuller, Daniel Higley, and Thomas Hayden; Jonathan Humphrey, Jr. (afterwards Col. Humphrey,) was Clerk of the Roll; all of Simsbury except Sergeant Hayden. Sergeant Pinney was a man of a fierce and fiery countenance and commanding air, well becoming a soldier of '75. Sergeant Tuller was a man from whom we did not expect much flattery; his brow was generally knit together in a forbidding frown. Sergeant Higley, who had been a soldier in the old French war, was of a musical turn, and his old war songs made the time pass away to very good account. Sergeant Thomas Hayden was, no doubt, a military man ; but I should guess no soldier ever admired him for his pleasant airs. Jonathan Humphrey, Clerk of Ihe Roll, was a most charming companion; his social airs and pleasant countenance gained the af fection and good wishes of all. He is long since dead, and lies buried near Major Elihu, in Hop Meadow burying ground. Our company being suddenly enlisted, to the number of about seventy-five, rank and file, orders were given for all to meet on a certain day at the house osthe Captain, well equipped, and ready to begin their march. \" The Rev. Mr. Pitkin, of Farmington, was requested lhat day to preach the fare well sermon to the soldiers. At the hour appointed, we marched to the meeting house, where the officers appeared in military style, with their appropriate badges of distinction, and the soldiers in proper order, with their arms and accoutrements, as men prepared for battle. It was a full and overflowing audience, all in high expecta tion of hearing something new and charming from so gifted a preacher. After his warm and fervent prayer to Heaven for the success and prosperity of the American armies, and the liberties and freedom of our country, he introduced his address, if I remember right, from these words : \" Play the man for your country, and for the cit ies of your God; and the Lord do that which seemeth him good.\" His seimon was -well adapted to the occasion, and the spirit of the day. It was tender and pathetic \u2014 lively and animating. It was like martial music; while it touched the finer feelings, it roused and animated for the dreadful onset \u2014 the shout of war and the cry of victo ry ! During the time ofils delivery, abundance of tears were seen to flow, from both old and young, male as well as female. The sermon being ended, the drums soon beat to arms. Being arranged in military order, we were again conducted to the Captain's house, and dismissed for a short time. In going to and from the meeting, we were followed and accompanied by a mixed multitude \u2014 fathers and mothers \u2014 -wives and children \u2014 sisters, friends and strangers. Now each soldier had ihe oppor- tunity of mingling fora few moments with his dearest friends and companions.

We begin our march wilh silence, downcast looks, ana pen sive feelings and reflections. We were now leaving our homes, our iriends^ ana ail our pleasant places behind, and which our eyes might never again behold. 1 ne mosi of us had not, at that time, I believe, been twenty miles from home. Alter marening awhile, we began to give way to more cheerful and lively feelings. We marched about eight miles that afternoon; at night put up at James Marsh's inn. Here, lor tne first time, I slept as a soldier on Ihe floor, with a cartridge-box for my pillow. Al that period, horse wagons being very little in use, an ox team was provided to carry our provision for the way, and a barrel of rum. Our provision was salt pork and peas. Wherever we stopped, a large kettle was hung over the fire in which the salt meat was put without freshening, and the dry peas without soaking. Cooks and stewards were appointed who took charge of the table department. When all was ready, a stroke on the drum was the signal to begin to eat ; and we were generally hungry enough to stand in need of no great urging. While passing through Connecticut, the females were very polite, in lending us knives and forks; but, after entering Massa chusetts, we were not allowed the like favor, without pledging money, or some other kind of security \u2014 the people saying they had lost many of their spoons by the soldiers who had gone before us. Our bread was hard biscuit, in which there was a small quantity of lime, just sufficient to make the mouth sore. They were so hard that the soldiers called them candlestick bottoms. \" Now, for the first time, we travelled on the Lord's day, under arms, and past meet ing houses in the time ofpublic worship, with drums and fifes playing martial music; all which was calculated to afford to a New England man some doubts and reflections, whether God would be as well pleased with such parade and military performance, as if we had stayed at home to read our Bibles, or went to meeting to hear the minis ter. But military discipline and the habits of a soldier, soon effected a degree of re laxation in most of us. In process of time, many once pious, at least in form and appearance, came into the practice of treating all days nearly alike; yet there were some who kept up the practice of reading Watts' Psalms and Hymns, as a book of devotion. \" It is very natural to expect, that soldiers under arms are not generally inclined to the same degree of civility as others, or as they ought to be ; though this is not always the case. Yet, at the period at which I am speaking, and during our march, it was not uncommon, if a soldier thought himself not well treated by the inn-keeper, to shew his resentment by shooting a ball through bis sign. \" In our march through Connecticut, the inhabitants seemed to view us with tokens of joy and gladness, and by them we were treated with common civility, and a respect due us as soldiers; but when we came into Massachusetts, and advanced nearer to Boston, the inhabitants wherever we stopped, seemed to have no better opinion of us (except the officers) than if we had been a banditti of rogues and thieves. This served to mortify our feelings, and sometimes drew from us expressions of angry resentment. \" After about nine or ten days' marching, in company wilh our ox team, loaded with our salt pork, peas, and candlestick bottoms for bread, and the barrel of rum to cheer our spirits and wash our feet, which began to be very sore by travelling, we came to Roxbury, the place of our destination. There the place of our encampment was already marked out, and a part of our regiment on the spot. For every six sol diers there was a tent provided. The ground it covered was about six or seven feet square. This served for kitchen, parlor and hall. The green turf, covered with a blanket, was our bed and bedstead. When we turned in for the night, -we had to lie perfectly straight, like candles in a box: this was not pleasant to our hip bones and knee joints, which often in the night would wake us, and be? to turn over. Our house hold utensils, altogether, were an iron pot, a canteen, or wooden bottle holding twa quarts, a pail, and wooden bowl. Each had to do his own washing, and take his turn. at the cookery.\" Simsbury, (Wheetog,) July 28lh, 1768. Last Saturday we had here such a storm of hail as perhaps has not been known ia the memory of man. The forenoon of that day was extremely hot; about noon a very black cloud began to rise, which in about two hours produced a heavy rain, attended \u25a0with violent thunder. When the rain abated, there came on hail, which increased so much that the last hail stones which fell were supposed to be full the bulk of goose-"], [117, "SOUTH1NGT0N. 105 eggs\u2014 rather bigger than less.

In addition to the account in our last of the hail storm at Simsbury, we learn that it destroyed great quantities of English grain, but did more damage to rye than wheat ; many large fields of the former having been since mowed for lodder, in which Jonathan Pettibone, Esq. Mr. Thomas Case, and others have been great sufferers. In the park of the above Case, a deer had one of his legs broke, and was otherwise so much wounded that he soon after died. Several hogs had their backs broke, some of which died some days afterwards. Some horses, and other large animals, were cut through the skin by the biggest and more ragged hail stones. 'Tis also to be noted, that great quantities of glass were broke, which the compiler of the former particu lars was not apprized of when he communicated the same to us. SOUTHINGTON. South view of Southington, (central part.) Southington is situated in the southwestern corner of Hartford County; bounded n. by Bristol and Farmington, w. by Wolcott, s. by Cheshire, and e. by a range of mountains, separating it from Berlin. The soil is generally good, and well adapted to the culture of rye and Indian corn. The township is about six miles in length, and about the same in breadth. The central part osthe town is 18 miles from Hart ford and 21 from New Haven. The population in 1810 was 1,807; in 1830, it was 1,844. The above is a south view of the three churches in the town, and some other buildings in the vicinity. The nearest building seen on the right is now occupied as a post office ; the next building north is the 14"], [118, "106 SOUTHINGTON. Episcopal church, part of which is seen in the engraving ; the building with a spire, in the center, is the Congregational church ; the Baptist church, with a square tower, is seen a little to the north. The Epis copal church has stood about 50 years ; the first house of worship used by the Baptists stands about twenty rods west, and is now used as an Academy; this building is about as old as the Episcopal church. The first Congregational church was erected about one mile north of its present location, on the southeast part osthe elevation, on which is the north burying ground. The first clergyman was Rev. Jeremiah Curtiss. This town was originally included in the limits of Farmington. It was laid out into lots, and divided among the eighty four proprietors of Farmington, in 1722. Several persons, however, had settled in it at that time, and within four or five years after that period, it was incor porated as a society, by the name of Southington, and was made a town in 1779. The first settlers were principally from Farmington ; a few from Wallingsord and Waterbury : their names were Woodruff, Hart, Andrews, Gridley, Newell, Lewis, Langdon, Root, Barnes, Clark, and others. The inhabitants are generally engaged in agriculture ; yet several kinds of manufactures receive considerable attention. Peck's patent for machines for making tin ware, a most valuable invention, is exclu sively owned in this town, and the business of making them is exten sively carried on, by Messrs. Seth Peck &. Co. whose manufactory sup plies almost the whole of the United States and the British provinces. The manufacture of water cement is very extensively carried on in this town, and furnishes a supply for the wants osthe vicinity, and some for distant markets. There is an establishment for the manufacture of lasts, which are turned out by a machine : this is effected by having a model of the shape wanted, inserted into the apparatus connected with the machinery. Besides the above, there is a brass foundery ; and several other establishments, for manufacturing various articles, such as saws of different kinds, tin ware, combs, spoons, clocks, brushes, &ic. are in ope ration, more or less extensively, at different times, according to the de mands of the market. Copper has been discovered, in several places, in the range of mountains on the eastern border of the town. The following has been often related as a matter of fact. It is stated, that about the first settlement of the town, one of the inhabitants, by the name of Tufts, a singular sort of a man, became so weary of life, that he determined to \"shuffle off this mortal coil.\" Having understood that those who perished by the cold, suffered but little pain, he concluded to freeze himself to death. Going out in the severity of winter, he seated himself down where a cold \"northwester\" blew fair upon him, and awaited the accomplishment of his purpose. After sitting awhile, he found the severity of the weather so uncom fortable that he was induced to go in the house, declaring that it was actually too cold to freeze to death, and wished for a great coat and mittens, in order to make his exit in a more comfortable manner."], [119, "SUFFIELD. 107 The following inscriptions are from monuments in the burying ground north of the principal village in Southington.

This town was originally under the jurisdiction of the colony of Massachusetts. It was purchased of two sachems by Mr. Pyncbeon, and some others, for about one hundred dollars. In 1670, a grant of Suffield was made to Maj. John Pyncheon and his associates, by the general court of Massachusetts, as a committee to lay it out and plant a township. It was settled about this period, and incorporated with town privileges. It continued subject to the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, till the year 1752, being then annexed to Connecticut. Suffield is bounded n. by Massachusetts, e. by Connecticut river, separating it from Enfield, w. by Granby and the Sottthwick ponds in Massachusetts, and s. by Windsor and Granby. The township, which is somewhat irregular in its form, averages about eight miles in length from east to west, and five in breadth. This town, though somewhat"], [120, "108 SUFFIELD. Connecticut Literary Institution, at Suffield, diversified in its surface and soil, is considered by many to be one of the best townships of land in the State : the eastern section, bordering upon Connecticut river, has a gradual rise for about two miles to the public road, which runs nearly in a parallel direction with the river. This is a fine tract, the soil being a strong and deep loam. There is no alluvial upon tbe border of the river, and the bank is generally eleva ted and hold. The town is divided into two parishes, Suffield and West Suffield. There are four houses of worship in the town, two for Baptists and two for Congregationalists. The population of Suffield has not varied much for the last forty years. In 1800, the number of inhabitants was 2,666 ; in 1810, they numbered 2,630 ; in 1830, their number was 2,690. Tbe principal street in the first society, which is a mile or more in length, lies on beautiful ground, rising gradually from the south towards the north. It is well settled, and contains many hand some dwelling houses. From the higher parts there is a fine prospect ; the peak of Mount Tom is seen at the distance of twenty miles, form ing a prominent object in the landscape, opening to the northward. Upon this street are two churches, one for the Congregationalists and one for the Baptists, a post office, stores, and the Connecticut Literary Institution. The above is a northeastern view of the Institution, which is pleas antly located in the center of the place, 16 miles s. of Hartford and 10 s. o< Springfield. It was commenced under the patronage of the Con necticut Baptist Education Society. A distinct act of incorporation was obtained in May, 1835. The edifice, which is constructed of brick, is 72 feet long and 34 wide, four stories high, containing 24 rooms, well furnished for the accommodation of students. \"Connected with the Institution, and owned by the corporation, are 16 acres of valuable land, and a large dwelling house for the use of a steward, who furnishes board, including washing, for 1 dol. 25 cts. per week. The average"], [121, "SUFFIELD. 109 number os students thus far has been about 60 : the number is con stantly increasing, and the seminary gives fair promise of rising to an elevated rank among institutions of similar character in the country. It will be perceived, in all correct maps of Connecticut, that a tract of land, about two miles in length and breadth, on the western boun dary of this town, projects into what would seem ought to belong to Connecticut. This tract has been left to the jurisdiction of Massachu setts, since the year 1800. It appears that the bounds of Springfield and Windsor were not defined with much accuracy, in this section ; the bounds at the northwest point of the projection, however, appear to have been clearly defined. The western bounds of Springfield, in which part of Suffield was included, were supposed, but erroneously, to extend to this point. A Mr. Moore, living on the tract in question, was knowing to the facts in the case. Having received a warning to a militia training, he refused to appear, denying that he was within the jurisdiction of Connecticut. The case was carried to the General As sembly of Connecticut, who, upon an examination of the facts in the case, were obliged to leave this tract to the jurisdiction of Massachu setts. \" The south line of Massachusetts, according to charter, runs west from a point three miles south of the most southerly branch of Charles river, and every part of it ; and the north line of Connecticut is the south line of Massachusetts. When Mr. Pynchon settled Springfield, and the first plantations were made in Connecticut, in 1635, it was not known whether the territory would fall within the limits of Massachu setts or not. But Mr. Pynchon at first considered himself as belonging to the jurisdic tion of the Connecticut plantations. In 1642, Massachusetts employed two surveyors, Woodward and Saffery, to run the line between the colonies. These pretended to as certain the south line on Charles river, and then sailing round and going up the Con necticut, they attempted to fix the line there, in the same latitude. But either through inattention or the use of bad instruments, they determined the line to fall in Windsor, many miles south of the true line. \u2014 Connecticut was dissatisfied with the determina tion of Woodward and Saffery, and made repeated proposals to Massachusetts for a mutual adjustment of the controversy, which were ineffectual. In 1694, a committee appointed by Connecticut, run the line and found the former survey very erroneous. In this situation, the inhabitants of Suffield and Enfield, who settled under the claims and jurisdiction of Massachusetts, continued to encroach upon Windsor and Sims bury, which excited warm animosities. In the year 1700, further attempts were made to procure an amicable settlement of the dispute ; the line was run by commissioners of both colonies, in 1702, and found to fall far north of the former line ; but Massa chusetts disagreed to their report. In 1708, Connecticut appointed commissioners with full powers lo run the line, and establish the boundary ; and resolved, that unless Massachusetts would unite to complete the business, they would apply to the crown. Massachusetts did not agree at once to the proposal of Connecticut ; but in 1713, com missioners were appointed on the part of both colonies, who came to an agreement on the 13th of July. On running the line, it was found to fall north of Enfield, Suffield, and Woodstock, which of course came within the jurisdiction of Connecticut. As an equivalent for the land which had been taken from Connecticut by encroachments, Massachusetts granted a tract of land in the western part of lhat colony, which, in 1716, was sold for two thousand two hundred and seventy-four dollars, which sum was applied to the use of Yale College. This agreement, however, was not considered as conclusive and satisfactory : nor was the boundary between the two states definitely settled till May, 1804.\"* Gen. Phineas Lyman, distinguished for his services during the French war, and for many public employments, was for several years a * Webster, Hist, of U. S."], [122, "110 SUFFIELD. resident in this town. He was born at Durham, about the year 1716, and educated at Yale College. He devoted himself to the profession of law, and commenced practice in this town. \" He took a distinguished part in the dispute between this state and Massachusetts, relative to the right of jurisdiction over the town of Suffield, and the other towns upon that boundary, settled by Massachusetts. He afterwards became a councillor, then called a magistrate, which office he held for a number of years. During the French war, he had a distinguished command in the northern army for several years. In the campaign of 1755, he served as major general in the provincial troops. At or soon after the close of the war, he went to England to support a claim of the officers of the provincial troops, having been authorised to act as general agent. After experiencing great difficulties and delay, (having returned once for an extension of his powers,) he succeeded in obtaining a grant of an extensive tract of land upon the Mississippi, in the vicinity of Natchez. He accordingly embarked, and sailed directly for the Mississippi, where he arrived about the year 1774. He dispatched one of his sons for his family, which during this period had remained in Suffield ; but just before their arrival, the same year, Gen. Lyman died, upon the tract of land of which he obtained a grant. His wife died during the pas sage, and his family left there soon after, on the country being reclaimed by the Spaniards.\"* Gideon Granger was born in this town, July 19, 1767. \" He was graduated at Yale College in 17S7, and in the following year was ad mitted a member of the bar of the supreme court of Connecticut, where he practiced law with great celebrity and distinction. In 1793 he was elected a member of the legislature of Connecticut, and was continued in that body for several years, and distinguished for energy, talents, and usefulness. To his enlightened exertions, this state is principally in debted for its school fund, so justly celebrated as the foundation of its primary schools, and the fostering parent of that useful information which prevails so generally in the state. In 1801,, he was appointed postmaster general of the United States, and continued to execute the duties of that important office with great ability, until the spring of 1814, when he removed to the state of New York. In April, 1819, he was elected a member of the senate of that state, which situation he re signed in 1821, on account of ill health. He died at his seat in Canan daigua, on the 31st of December, 1822. Mr. Granger was a man of commanding appearance, of a striking physiognomy, of talents equally brilliant and profound, of a kind and benevolent heart, and unimpeach able rectitude. He was an able speaker and a powerful writer. His wri tings were confined almost entirely to political subjects.

During the Revolutionary war, he was employed by the state of Massachusetts, in the commissary department. Whilst in this situation, his transactions were of a most extensive and responsible nature, and his own paper formed a kind of circulating me dium.

WETHERSFIELD. Wethersfield was one of the first settled towns in Connecticut. It is claimed by some, to be the oldest settlement in the state, as a few men from Watertown in Massachusetts, came to Connecticut in 1634,* and erected a few huts at Pyquag, now Wethersfield, where they made out to subsist during the winter. The next year, 1635, Dr. Trumbull says, \" the Watertown people gradually removed and prosecuted their settlement at Wethersfield.\" The probability is, that most of the Wethersfield settlers came round from Boston by water, and arrived be fore the Windsor and Hartford settlers, who came through the wilder ness, and did not reach the Connecticut till about the 9th of November. This appears probable from the tradition which is still preserved, \"that the first white woman who ever set foot in Connecticut, was a woman by the name of Barber ;\" the tradition is, that when the settlers arriv ed at the place where they were to land, some controversy arose who should first set foot on the shore. While the men were contending with each other for this privilege, a woman by the name of Barber, taking advantage of the contention, dextrously sprang forward, and reaching the shore, had the honor of first treading on the soil. Wethersfield contains three parishes ; Rocky Hill (3d society) on the south, Nevvington (2d society) on the northwest, and Wethersfield proper, on the northeast. The township is bounded n. by Hartford, w. by Berlin, s. by Middletown, and e. by Connecticut river, which sep arates it from Glastenbury. Extensive and fertile meadows border the Connecticut, and a broad and higher level tract, with light but rich soil, lies immediately west of the meadows. It is on this tract that the pleasant village of Wethersfield is built, four miles south of Hartford. Of the three principal streets two run from north to south, one of which is very broad and extensive ; the other runs from southeast to northwest, along the bank of a large cove which sets up from the Connecticut to the north of the village. There are in the village three houses of pub lic worship : 1 Congregational, 1 Baptist, 1 Methodist. There is a female seminary of some celebrity, established some years since, in the village. It is said that Mr. Hooker's company first pitched near what is now called \" the Folly ;\" the main channel of the river at that time, came round by the Cove. Here they found meadows, or lands, as they term ed them, on both sides, but no mill stream ; the main body then return ed to the Little or Mill river in Hartford, and located themselves on both sides of that stream. The few settlers that remained near the \" Folly\" afterwards located themselves on Wolcott hill, about one mile westward of the main village in Wethersfield, and nearly in a range with Main street in Hartford, which is in fair view. Finding this place too far from the meadows, the most of the settlers removed to the eastward, to where the principal village is now built. * Historians do not agree as to the time, some stating it to be 1634, others 1635 It is believed, however, that these men erected their huts in the fall of 1634."], [125, "113 wethersfield.

The diagram annexed shows the extent of the changes which have been made. The course of the river which is shaded, shows its course at the time when the first settlers arrived : the present channel is seen by the dotted lines. From the west bank of the cove to the farthest eastern bank of the old channel, is about two miles. The tract A contains a number of hundred acres of good land, over which the river has gradually passed to its present course, from the old channel seen in the diagram, which is now obliterated. The town of Wethersfield retaining its old bounds, it will be perceived that the tract A, although on the east side of the river, is within the bounds of Wethersfield. At Pratt's ferry the present channel crosses the old bed of the river, and the river is now constantly advancing eastward; and it will be perceived that the tract B is within the limits of Glas tenbury, although on the west side of the Connecticut. The new made lands, which are formed as the water recedes, are at first too cold and sandy to sustain vegetation : in a short time, however, a growth of willows appears, which are succeeded by a growth of poplars ; when these are cleared off the land will produce corn, and from this period it becomes valuable. The changing of the bed of the river has been the occasion of much litigation respecting the title to the soil. Mr. Butler, who owned a 15"], [126, "114 WETHERSFIELD. tract upon which the river was encroaching, found after a while some of his land appearing on the opposite side of the river, and accordingly laid claim to it. His claim was disputed, as he never owned land on that side of the river. It was a long time before this case was decided. There appeared some difficulty in making the jury who sat on the case understand the merits of the question. Mr. Ingersoll, a relative of the Ingersoll family in New Haven, was the counsel employed by Mr. But ler. He illustrated the case, by supposing that Mr. B. had built a cas tle on the land in question. Although the ground on which it stood might be overflowed, yet still it was his castle, and also the ground on which it stood, and he had a right to bis property wherever he could find it. The case was finally decided in accordance with these views. \u2014 The ancient fort referred to by the letter/, stood at the south end of the gar den belonging to Frederick Butler, Esq. ; some of the foundation stones are still remaining. In April, 1637, a party of Pequots \"waylaid the people at Wethersfield, as they were going into the fields to labor, and killed six men and three women. Two maids were taken captive. Besides this they killed twenty cows, and did other damage to the in habitants.\" The place where these two young women were taken cap tive was about 40 rods east of Mr. Butler's house : one of ihe young wo men that were taken was of the name of Swain. \u2014 It will be perceived that a place on the diagram, on the Hartford road, is designated by the word \" Folly.\" A small stream here passes the road, which has wash ed down a considerable depth into the clayey soil. This is commonly called \" Wethersfield Folly ;\" it is believed, however, the proper term would be \" Wethersfield Wisdom.\" It was occasioned by draining a large tract of land (now valuable, which extended up a considerable dis tance towards Hartford,) of water accumulated by the melting of snow and ice, and rains, which rendered it of little or no value. This place has long been celebrated for the great quantities of onions which are raised here annually, and exported to various parts of the United States and the West Indies. The cultivation of this root re quires but a small portion of land, and the labor is principally performed by females. The State Prison of Connecticut was erected in this town in 1S26, and the prisoners from Newgate Prison in Granby were removed here the next year. This building is situated on the south margin of the Cove, which sets back from Connecticut river, at the north end of Weth ersfield village. The buildings of the prison form very nearly a quad rangle ; on the south side of which stands the building which is more properly the Prison. The apartments of the warden are situated in the east end of this building ; the center surrounds the block of cells, 4 stories high, in which the male prisoners are locked up. This hall or center, is 154 feet long, 43 feet wide, and 30 feet high ; the number of cells or night rooms is 200. The west end is used as the female de- partment, (superadded in 1830,) containing cells, rooms for labor, kitchen and apartments for the matron. The east, north, and west sides of this quadrangle, are formed by a wall 20 feet high. Within this yard are situated two ranges of shops ; one on the east side, and one upon the"], [127, "W E T H E 11 S F I E L 1) 115 State Prison, at Wethersfield. west, in which the convicts perform their daily labor. The passage into the prison is through the warden's apartment, into the guard room, thence into the hall surrounding the cells, thence into the yard. This is the only passage, except through a large gate on the north side of the yard. Rocky Hill, (formerly Stepney,) the south parish of Wethersfield, lies on a collection of hills, which are a continuation of the Middletown range : one of these eminences, Rocky Hill, has given name to the pa rish. It has a pleasant little village, on an elevated situation, seven miles from Hartford, with a landing at some distance, where considera ble commerce and ship building were formerly carried on. Newington, the 2d society in Wethersfield, was formerly called Cow plain. The village is pleasantly situated in a fertile valley, west of Ce dar mountain : the central part is 6 miles from Hartford, and 4 from Wethersfield village. The inhabitants (about 650 in number) are chiefly engaged in agriculture, and are distinguished for their general intelligence, and attachment to the institutions of morality and religion. There are two houses of public worship : 1 Congregational and 1 Meth odist. Newington was settled about 140 years since, by five men from Wethersfield, three of whom were of the name of Andrews, who erect ed their house near the center of the place. The two others were of the names of Sled and Hunn. Sled built his house where the Academy now stands, and Hunn located himself in the north part of the place. One of the Andrews built his house a few rods south of the Congrega tional church. This house was used for some time as a fort, around which they built a high wall or fence to defend it from the Indians. Here they all lodged at night, with their guns in their hands. The In dians were very numerous, and lived principally around a pond in the center of the place, from which they obtained an abundance of fish. Here was a little city or village of wigwams. These Indians were ever friends to the whites ; Sequin was their sachem : they were subject to the sachem at Middletown. \u2014 The Rev. Elisha Williams was ordained"], [128, "116 WETHERSFIELD. the first minister in October, 1722, who removed in 1726, being chosen Rector of Yale College. He was succeeded by the Rev. Simon Back us, who died at Cape Breton in 1745, being a chaplain in the army in that expedition. \u2014 The following pleasant and unusual circumstance is said to have taken place in Newington, many years since. Mr. A of this place, who was a very religious and conscientious man, married for a wife one of the most ill natured and troublesome women which could be found in the vicinity. This occasioned universal surprise wherever he was known, and one of his neighbors ventured to ask him the reasons which governed his choice. Mr. A replied, that hav ing had but little or no trouble in the world, he was fearful of becoming too much attached to things of time and sense. And he thought by expe riencing some afflictions, be should become more weaned from the world, and that he married such a woman as he thought would accomplish the object. The best part of the story is, that the wife, bearing of the rea sons why he married her, was much offended, and out of revenge, be came one of the most pleasant and dutiful wives in the town, declaring that she was not going to be made a pack horse, to carry her husband to heaven- Webb House, in Wethersfield. The above is a view of the \" Webb House,\" formerly so called. It is now occupied by Martin Welles, Esq. It is situated a few rods south of the Congregational church, in the central part of the village of Weth ersfield, and is distinguished as the house where Gen. Washington made his quarters while in Wethersfield, durinsthe council of general officers of the American and French armies. Within its walls, it is believed that the plan was matured, which resulted in the capture of Cornwallis at Yorktown, and the establishment of American independence. The following account of the bloody tragedy of the murder of the Beadle family in this town, is annexed to a sermon preached by the"], [129, "WETHERSFIELD. 117 Rev. John Marsh in Wethersfield, Dec. 13th 1782, at the funeral of Mrs. Beadle and her children. \" A letter from a gentleman in Wethersfield to his friend, containing a narrative of the life of William Beadle, (so far as it is known,) and the particulars of the mas- sacre of himself and Family.\" \" Sir, \u2014 'Tis not strange that reports various and contradictory, should have circula ted on so interesting and terrible a subject as that of a man's consigning to the grave himself and family, in a moment osapparent ease and tranquillity. The agitation of mind which must be the consequence of being near such a scene of horror, will suffi ciently apologize for not answering your request for the particulars ere this. Our ignorance of the history of this man, at first precluded a possibility of giving you sat isfaction on this head. Perhaps no one in this town had more favorable opportuni ties of obtaining the particulars of his history : yet I could never induce him to men tion a single syllable relating to his age, parentage, or early occupation. To have asked him directly would have been rude, when he evidently meant to be silent on these subjects. My conjecture was, that he was the natural son of some gentleman in England, and that he had been brought up in or near London, and had been about the court. Since his decease I have been able to learn from undoubted authority, that he was born in the county of Essex, in a village not very far from London. As to his business in youth, I am still lest in the dark, but find he hasonce mentioned to a gentle man, some little incidents which happened to him while in company wilh his lather, and that he very early became acquainted with a club in London, who were Deists, where 'tis probable he received the first rudiments in those principles. While in Eng land, where he left a mother and sister, he had a fair character for integrity and hon esty. In the year 1755, he went out to the island of Barbadoes, in the family of Charles Pinfold Esq. Governor of that Island, where he tarried six years, then return ed to England, purchased some merchandize, and from thence came to New York in the year 1762, and immediately removed to Stratford in this Slate, from thence to Der by, and then to Fairfield, where he married and dwelt for some years. By this time, he had acquired about twelve hundred pounds property, with which he removed to this town, about ten years since, where he resided until his death. His business was that of retailing ; he formerly credited his goods, but since his residence in this town he has refused to give any credit, intending to keep his property within his own reach, believing it always secure while his eye was upon it. While here he added consider able to his stock, none of which he ever vested in real estate : the Continental curren cy taught him that wealth could take to itself wings and flyaway: notwithstanding all his vigilance. \" When the war commenced, he had on hand a very handsome assortment of goods for a country store, which he sold for the currency of the country, without any ad vance in the price ; the money he laid by, waiting and expecting the time would soon arrive when he might therewith replace his goods, resolving nut to part with it until it should be in as good demand as when received by him. His expectations from this quarter daily lessening, finally lost all hope, and was thrown into a state little bet ter than despair, as appears from his writing ; he adopted a plan of the most rigid family economy, but still kept up the outward appearance of his former affluence, and ever to the last entertained his friend with his usual decent hospitality although noth ing appeared in his outward deportment, which evinced the uncommon pride of his heart ; his writings shew clearly that he was determined not to bear the mortification of being thought by his friends poor and dependent. On this subject he expresses him self in the following extraordinary manner: ' 11\" a man, who has once lived well, meant well and done well, falls by unavoidable accident into poverty, and then sub mits to be laughed at, despised and trampled on, by a set of mean wretches as far be low him as the moon is below the sun; I say if such a man submits, he must become meaner than meanness itself, and I sincerely wish he might have ten years added to his natural life to punish him for his folly.\" \"He fixed upon the night succeeding the 18th of November for the execution of his nefarious purpose, and procured a supper of oysters, of which the family eat very plentifully; that evening he writes as follows: 'I have prepared a noble supper of oysters, that my flock and I may eat and drink together, thank God and die.' After supper he sent \"the maid with a studied errand to a friend's house at some distance, di recting her to stay until she obtained an answer to an insignificant letter he wrote his friend, intending she should not return that evening \u2014 she did however return, perhaps her return disconcerted him and prevented him for that time. The next day he car ried his pistols to a smith for repair ; it may be, the ill condition of his pistols might be an additioual reason lor the delay. \" On the evening of the 10th of December some persons were with him at his house Jo whom he appeared as cheerful and serene as usual ; he attended to the little affairs"], [130, "118 WETHEESFIELD. of his family as if nothing uncommon was in contemplation. The company left him about nine o'clock in the evening, when he was urgent as usual for their stay ; wheth- er he slept that night is uncertain, but it is believed he went to bed. The children and maid slept in one chamber; in the gray of the morning of the 11th of December he went to their bed chamber, awaked the maid and ordered her to rise gently, without disturbing the children when she came down stairs, he gave her a line to the family phy- sician who lived at the distance of a quarter of a mile, ordered her to carry it immedi- ately, at the same time declaring that Mrs. Beadle had been ill all night, and directing her to stay until the physician should come with her; this he repeated sundry times with a degree of ardor. There is much reason to believe he had murdered Mrs. Beadle be- sore he awaked the maid. Upon the maid's leaving the house he immediately pro- ceeded to execute his purpose on the children and himself. It appears he had for some time before, carried to the bedside every night an ax and a carving knile; he smote his wife and each of the children with the ax on the side of the head as they lay sleep- ing in their beds; the woman had two wounds in the head, the skull of each of them was fractured; he then with the carving knife cut their throats from ear to ear; the woman and little boy were drawn partly over the side of their beds, as if to prevent the bedding from being besmeared with blood ; the three daughters were taken from the bed and laid upon the floor side by side, like three lambs, before their throats were cut; they were covered with a blanket, and the woman's face with a handkerchief. He then proceeded to the lower floor of the house, leaving marks of his footsteps in blood on the stairs, carrying with him the ax and knife, the latter he laid upon the table in the room where he was found, reeking with the blood of his family. Perhaps he had thoughts he might use it against himself if his pistols should fail ; it appears he then seated himself in a Windsor chair, with his arms supported by the arms of the chair ; he fixed the muzzles of the pistols into his two ears and fired them at the same instant ; the balls went through the head in transverse directions. Although the neighbors were very near and some of them awake, none heard the report of the pistols. The capital facts of the massacre you have seen in the public papers; a minute detail was too horrible to be given at first, until the mind (especially of the relatives of the unhap- py woman) had been prepared for it by a summary narrative, and even now 'tis enough to give feelings to apathy itself to relate the horrid tale. \" The line to the physician obscurely announced the intentions of the man; the house was soon opened, but alas, too late ! The bodies were pale and motionless, swimming in their blood, their faces white as mountain snow, yet life seemed to tremble on their lips ; description can do no more than saintly ape and trifle with the real figure. \" Such a tragical scene filled every mind with the deepest distress; nature recoiled and was on the rack with distorting passions ; the most poignant sorrow and tender pity for the lady and her innocent babes, who were the hapless victims of the brutal studied cruelty of an husband and father, in whose embraces they expected to find se- curity, melted every heart. Shocking effects of pride and false notions about reli- gion ! \" To paint the first transports this affecting scene produced, when the house was open ed is beyond my reach. \u2014 Multitudes of all ages and sexes were drawn together bv the sad tale. \u2014 The very inmost souls of the beholders were wounded at the sight, and\" torn by contending passions: Silent grief, with marks of astonishment were succeeded by furious indignation against the author of the affecting spectacle, which vented itself in incoherent exclamations. Some old soldiers accidentally passing thro' the town that morning, on their way from camp to visit their friends, led by curiosity turned in, to view the sad remains; on sight of the woman and her tender offspring, notwithstand- ing all their firmness, the tender sympathetic tear stealing gently down their furrowed cheeks, betrayed the anguish of their hearts; on being shewed the body of the sacrifi cer they paused a moment, then muttering forth an oath or two of execration, with their eyes fixed on the ground in silent sorrow, they slowly went their way. So aw ful and terrible a disaster, wrought wonderfully on the minds of the neighborhood \u25a0 nature itselsseemed ruffled, and refused the kindly aid of balmy sleep for a time. ' \"Near the close of the day on the 12th of December, the bodies being still unburied the people who had collected in great numbers, grew almost frantic with rage, and in a manner demanded the body of the murderer; the law being silent on the subject, it was difficult to determine where decency required the body should be placed, many proposed it should be in an ignominious manner where sour roads met, without any coffin or insignia of respect, and perforated by a stake. Upon which a question arose where that place could be found which might be unexceptionable to trie neighborhood\u2014 but no one would consent it should be near his house or land. After some consultation it was thought best to place it on the bank of the river between high and low water mark ; the body was handed out of the window and bound with cords on a sled with the clothes on as it was found, and the bloody knife tied on his breast, without coffin or box, and the horse he usually rode was made fast to the sled\u2014 ihe horse, unaccustomed"], [131, "WETHERSFIELD. 119 to the draught, proceeded with great unsteadiness, sometimes running full speed then stopping, followed by a multitude, until arriving at the water's edfe the body was tumbled into a hole dug for the purpose, like the carcase of a beast. Not many days alter there appeared an uneasiness in sundry persons at placing the body so near a fer ry much frequented ; some threatenings were given out that the body should be taken up and a second time exposed to view. It was thought prudent it should be removed and secretly deposited in some obscure spot; it was accordingly removed with the ut most secrecy ; notwithstanding which some children accidentally discovered the place and the early freshets partly washed up the body, and it has had a second remove to a place where it is hoped mankind will have no further vexation with it. \" On the 13th of December the bodies of the murdered were interred in a manner much unlike that of the unnatural murderer. The remains osthe children were borne by a suitable number of equal age, attended by a sad procession of youths of the town, all bathed in tears; side by side the hapless woman's corpse was carried in solemn procession to the parish church yard, followed by a great concourse, who with affec tionate concern and every token of respect were anxious to express their heartfelt sor row in performing the last mournful duties. \" The person of Mr. Beadle was small, his features striking and full of expression, with the aspect of fierceness and determination ; his mind was contemplative, when once he had formed an opinion, was remarkably tenacious ; as a merchant or trader, he was esteemed a man of strict honor and integrity, and would not descend to any low or mean artifice to advance his fortune. He was turned of 52 years of age when he died. \"Mrs. Beadle was born at Plymouth, in Massachusetts, of reputable parents \u2014 a comely person, of good address, well bred, and unusually serene, sincere, unaffected and sensible; died in the middle of life, aged 32 years. \" The children, (the eldest of which was a son, aged 12 years, the other three, daughters, the youngest aged 6 years,) were such as cheered the hearts of their pa rents, who were uncommonly fond of displaying their little virtues and excellencies, and seemed to anticipate a continuance of growing parental satisfaction; alas, like early tender buds nipped by untimely frosts, they did but begin to live I \" It is more than probable, that this man had for months past desired that some or all of his children might be taken out of the world by accident; he removed all means of security from a well near his house, which he was careful heretofore to keep covered. His little boy he often sent to swim in the river, and has been heard to chide the child for not venturing further into deep water than his fears would suffer him. He has at times declared it would give him no pain or uneasiness to follow his children to the grave : his acquaintance knew these expressions could not arise from want of affec tion or tenderness for his children, hut rather imagined him speaking rashly in jest. He ever spoke lightly of death as a bugbear the world causelessly seared. It appears from his writings, he at first had doubts whether it was just and reasonable for him to deprive his wife of life, and offers against it only this reason, that he had no hand in bringing her into existence, and consequently had no power over her life. She set out the 7th of November on a journey to Fairsield, which he thought was by direction of Heaven to clear him of his doubts and remove her out of the way, at the time the busi ness was to be done; and his intention was to have executed his design on himselsand children in her absence. She proceeded no further than New Haven, and by reason of some disappointment, returned ten days earlier than expected; he appeared cha grined at her early return, and soon began to invent some justifying reasons for de priving her ot' life also. He finally concludes it would be unmerciful to leave her be hind to languish out a life in misery and wretchedness, which must be the consequence osthe surprising death of the rest of\" the family, and that since they had shared the frowns and smiles of fortune together, it would be cruelty to her, to be divided from them in death. \" 'Tis very natural for you to ask, whether it was possible a man could be trans formed from an affectionate husband and an indulgent parent lo a secret murderer, without some previous alteration, which must have been noticed by the family or ac quaintance. Yet this was the case in this instance : there was no visible alteration in his conduct. It appears by his writings that he thought he had a right to deprive him self of life, and intended to exercise that right if ever he should think himself unfor tunate: the extension of this right to his children was very easy. 'Tis probable, the principle had grown up gradually to the last stage. Since his death I have seen a let ter he wrote to a friend as early as 1777, in which he has an expression like this \u2014 ' I be lieve I and my family shall not live to see the end of the war.' It was then understood to mean nothing more than his expectation that the war would continue a long lime: his late conduct has explained it very differently. Whether Mrs. Beadle had any fears of his evil intentions or not, is uncertain : that she had fears some great calamity would befall the family is evident, both from what she said, and what he has left in writing. He writes on the 18th of November, that on the morning of the 17th she"], [132, "120 WETHERSFIELD-. told him, ' She dreamed he had wrote many papers, and was earnestly concerned for her, and that those papers were spotted with blood ; and that she also saw a man wound himself past recovery, and blood guggle, (as she expressed it,) from different parts of his body.' In another letter, osa later date, he writes as follows, viz. ' I men- tioned before that my wife had a dream concerning this affair ; she has since had two more, one of them, that she was suddenly seized and liable to great punishment ; that it created great confusion, but she afterwards got free and was happy : from her excel- lence of heart, I have no doubt but this will be the case with her. On the thanksgiv- ing night she dreamed that her three daughters all lay dead, and that they even lroze in that situation ; and even yet I am little affected.' \" The afternoon before this terrible execution, Mrs. Beadle walked abroad to visit an acquaintance, and it was observed by the lady she was uncommonly pensive ; she asked the reason. Mrs. Beadle with much concern told her, ' She bad for months been troubled with frightful and uncommon dreams, and that very morning she dreamed violence had been offered her family, and her children destroyed; she said those dreams wrought on her mind to a very great degree ; to divert her thoughts from them she had walked abroad that afternoon; and that she verily believed Providence had judgments in store for their family, which he was about to inflict on them by some sweeping sickness, or in some other awful manner.' Mr. Beadle, who, as appears by his writings, was alone privy to his malevolent intentions, put a very different con- struction upon her dreams. He doubtless considered them as premonitions from Heaven, and convincing proof to him that his purpose was right, of which he says he had sundry intimations he really thought from God himself, which he does not describe. \" From whence those dreams originated, it is impossible to determine ; whether the weapons he carried to his bedside gave her uneasiness, and excited a jealousy in her mind of his intentions, or whether any of his conduct which fell under her observation might be alarming to her, which might trouble her sleep, no one can tell. She has late- ly mentioned sundry dreams of a similar nature, which she had near six months since. Some great and good characters have thought such intimations were at times given from on high, to convince mankind of the reality of the invisible world \u2014 to hazard such a conjecture in these modern days would perhaps bethought by the learned world a great mark of fanaticism\u2014 every man must think for himself, no one can pronounce with satisfactory certainty with respect to the origin and cause of such thoughts in sleep, which so nearly correspond with the true state of facts. Her last dream penned by him was nearly literally verified. Although the weather was serene and pleasant on the 10th and near full moon, neither the sun or moon were visible from the time this horrid deed was done, until the body of this man was laid beneath the clods, which redoubled the horror: when suddenly the wind blew from the northwest, dispelled the vapors and discovered a cloudless sky. The air grew cold, and the faces of the other five being opened to view in their coffins, in front of the meeting house, the concourse was so great that much time was spent to give opportunity for all to take a view ; the cold still increasing, the bodies in all probability were stiffened with frost. \" Mr. Beadle left sundry letters directed to his acquaintance, and one labored trea- tise in justification of his conduct ; they contain many inconsistencies. He professes himself a Deist, but reprobates Atheism. While in life and prosperity, he claimed to- be a Christian, and offered two of his children in baptism. Much has been said in sa- vor of publishing his writings by those who have not seen them ; those who have pe- rused them doubt the propriety of such a measure ; not because his reasonings against revelation were in any degree unanswerable, but lest they might have some effect on weak and melancholy minds. He attempts to attack all rulers in Church and State, treats the Christian religion with a great degree of bitterness and bigotry ; and yet ab- surdly concludes by saying, 'if it is true he shall be saved by it.' He is very unsettled, wavering and inconsistent in his own beloved system of Deism. He flatters his pride by believing that it was the height of heroism to dare to die by his own hands, and that the Deity would not willingly punish one, who was impatient to visit his God and learn his will from his own mouth, face to face, in some suture world or worlds, (which he thinks may be many,) and seems to think there is as great probability of succeeding advantageously, in removing from one world to another as from one country or cabin\"- to another; and seeing all men must be lugged off at last, (as he expresses it,) he was determined to make the experiment voluntarily which all must do through necessity As he was much out of temper with the world, he was unwilling any of his family should stay behind to encounter its troubles, and since 'tis a father's duty lo provide for his fleck, he chose to consign them over to better hands. \"'Tis doubtful whether any history of modern limes can afford an instance of simi- lar barbarity, even in the extreme distress of war. The ancients encouraged by num- bers and example, did in hours of despair destroy themselves and families lo avoid the shame of becoming captives to be led in triumph, and the cruelty commonly exer cised in those barbarous ages. \u00ab Your very humble Servant \" Wethersfield, February, 1783."], [133, "WETHERSFIELD. 121 Extracts from the Wethersfield ancient town records.

The above is copied from one of the oldest monuments in the State. The tradition is, that Mr. Chester, who was one of the first settlers of Wethersfield, having some business to perform in the south part osthe town, which was then a wilderness, became lost in the woods. Being missed, his neighbors went in search of him, making noises in the woods, and uttering lamentations. After a lapse of several days, bis neighbors had the good fortune to meet with him on a mountain in Berlin, which has ever since been called Mount Lamentation. The device which appears at the head of the inscription on bis monument, has been the subject of much speculation. By some it has been believed to be a representation of some demon in the form of a fiery flying serpent, which according to the legend of the times, appeared to Mr. Chester while in the wilderness. Upon examination, however, it appears to have been nothing more than a rude attempt to engrave the family coat of arms. The Beadle family are buried in the northeastern part of the yard. The following inscription, said to have been written by the Hon. John Davis of Boston, is upon a slab of sandstone, lying horizontally, being raised about three feet from the ground by brick work underneath. Here lie interred, Mrs. Lydia Beadle, aged 32 years.

This was in 1633, when William Holmes and others erected a house at the mouth of Farmington river. The town, which originally comprised an extensive tract, is now bounded n. by Suffield, w. by Bloomfiekl, Simsbury and Granby, s. by Bloomfield and Hartford, and e. by Connecticut river. It is 8J miles in length from north to south ; at the north part the town is 6 miles in breadth, at the south part 3 miles. Farmington river, the largest tributary stream osthe Connecticut, passes through the central part osthe town. Wind sor is generally of a level surface, having some extensive tracts of plains, and the other parts are of an undulating character. The soil is various, but generally fertile, and free from stone. There are two societies, Windsor proper, and Poquannoc. There are three houses for worship, 2 for Congregationalists, and f for Methodists. In the town there are 4 paper mills, 1 Kentucky jean factory, 2 for cotton batting, 1 wire and 1 satinet factory. Ship plank is manufactured at a village of about 20 houses, at the Windsor Locks, where the canal commences which runs by Enfield falls. This place, called Pine Meadow, is op posite Warehouse Point in East Windsor. Almost all the inhabitants in the first society live on a single street, which runs parallel with the river. The present number of inhabitants is believed to be about 1,900."], [136, "124 WINDSOR. South view of the Congregational Church, Windsor. The above is a south view of the Congregational church, and the bridge, upon Mr. Town's plan, which crosses the Farmington river at this place. A pleasant grove stands upon the south bank osthe river ; a few of the trees are seen in the engraving. The north bank, on which the church stands, is considerably elevated. In time of freshet, vessels of considerable size can come up as far as the bridge. One of the first ships which came over to New England in 1630, brought over the Rev. Mr. John Wareham, Mr. John Maverick, Mr. Rossiter, Mr. Ludlow, Mr. Henry Wolcott, and others of Mr. Ware ham's church and congregation, who first settled the town of Windsor. This was considered an honorable company. Mr. Rossiter and Mr. Ludlow were magistrates ; Mr. Wolcott had a great estate, and was a man of superior abilities. Mr. Wareham had been a celebrated minister in Exeter, the capital of the county of Devonshire. The people who came with him were from the counties of Devonshire, Dorsetshire and Somersetshire. This company sailed from Plymouth, and arrived at Nantasket on the 30th of May. The next day the master osthe ship left them and their goods on Nantasket point, to shift for themselves. By the assistance osthe old planters, they proceeded up Charles river to Watertown, but as they had many cattle, and finding a neck of land at Mattapan, where there were good accommodations for them, they soon removed there, and began a settlement, which they named Dorchester. In 1631, Wahquimacut, an Indian sachem, living near Connecticut river, made a journey to Plymouth and Boston, and earnestly entreated the governors of each of the colonies to send men to make settlements on the river. He represented the fmitfulness osthe country, and prom ised the English, that if they would make a settlement, he would annu ally supply them with corn, and give them eighty beaver skins."], [137, "WINDSOR. 125 The governor of Massachusetts, although he treated the sachem and his company with generosity, paid no attention to his proposals. Mr. Winslow, the governor of Plymouth, judged it worthy of attention. It seems that soon after that, he went into Connecticut, and discovered the river and the adjacent parts. It appeared that the earnestness with which the sachem solicited the English to make settlements on the river, originated from the distressed state of the river Indians. Pekoath, the great sachem of the Pequots, was at war with them and driving them from the country, and they imagined that if the English made set tlements on the river, they would assist them in defending themselves against their too powerful enemies. Governor Winslow being pleased with the appearance osthe country, the Plymouth people made preparations for erecting a trading house, and establishing a small company upon the river. In 1633, William Holmes, with his associates, having prepared the frame of a house, with boards and materials for covering it immediately, put them on board of a vessel and sailed for Connecticut. Holmes landed and erected his house a little below the mouth of the Little or Farmington river, in Windsor. The house was covered with the utmost dispatch, and for tified with palisadoes. The sachems who were the original owners of the soil having been driven away by the Pequots were brought back by Holmes' vessel. The Plymouth people purchased of them the land on which they erected their house. This, Governor Wolcott says, was the first house erected in Connecticut.* The Dutch about the same time built their trading house at Hartford. In June, 1634, the Dutch sent Jacob Van Curter to purchase lands on the Connecticut. He made a purchase of about twenty acres at Hartford, of Nepuquash, a Pequot captain, on the 25th of October. Curter protested against Holmes, the builder of the Plymouth house. Some time afterwards, the Dutch governor, Van Twiller, of Fort Am sterdam, sent a reinforcement to Connecticut, in order to drive Holmes from the river. A party of seventy men under arms, with banners displayed, assaulted the Plymouth house, but they found it so well for tified, and the men who kept it so vigilant and determined, that it could not be taken without bloodshed. They therefore came to a parley, and finally returned in peace. A number of Mr. Warebam's people came, in the summer of 1635, to Connecticut, and made preparations to bring their families and make a permanent settlement. After having made such preparations as they judged necessary, they began to remove their families and property. \" On the 15th of October, about sixty men, women and children, with their horses, cattle and swine, commenced their journey from Massa- * This house stood about two miles southeast of the first Congregational church, on the river bank, about twenty rods from a point of land extending down the river, near the western shore. It was at this place that the Farmington or Windsor river entered the Connecticut. The mouth of the river is now about sixty rods above. This was changed by Governor Wolcott's cutting a channel for a ferry-boat across the point of land mentioned above. This channel has become so much enlarged that it is now the main channel of the river. The meadow lying in the vicinity of where this house stood, is to this day called the Plymouth Meadow."], [138, "126 WINDSOR. chusetts, through the wilderness, to Connecticut river. After a tedious and difficult journey, through swamps and rivers, over mountains and rough grounds, which were passed with great difficulty and fatigue, they arrived safely at the places of their respective destination. They were so long on their journey, and so much time and pains were spent in passing the river, and in getting over their cattle, that after all their ex- ertions, winter came upon them before they were prepared.\" By the 15th of November, Connecticut river was frozen over, and the snow was so deep, and the weather so tempestuous, that a conside- rable number of the cattle could not be brought across the river. The severity of the season was such, and so little time to prepare their huts and shelters for their cattle, that the sufferings of man and beast were extreme. They had shipped their household furniture, and most of their provisions at Boston, but by reason of delays, and the tempestuousness of the season, were either cast away or did not arrive in season. About the beginning of December, provisions generally failed in the settlements on the river, and famine and death looked the inhabitants in the face. In their distress, some of them in this severe season attempt- ed to go through the wilderness, to the nearest settlement in Massachu- setts. A company of thirteen, who made the attempt, lost one of their number, who, in passing a river, fell through the ice and was drowned. The other twelve were ten days on their journey, and had they not re- ceived assistance from the Indians, would all have perished. Such was the general distress by the 3d and 4th of December, that a considerable part of the settlers were obliged to leave their habitations. Seventy persons, men, women and children, were obliged in the severity of win- ter, to go down to the mouth of the river to meet their provisions, as the only expedient to preserve their lives. Not meeting the vessels which they expected, they all went on board of the Rebecca, a vessel of about 60 tons. This vessel, two days before, was frozen in, twenty miles up the river ; but by the falling of a small rain, and the influence of the tide, the ice became so broken, that she made a shift to get out. She however ran upon the bar, and the people were forced to unlade her to get her off. She was reladed, and in five days reached Boston. Had it not been for these providential circumstances, the people must have perished from famine. The people who remained and kept their stations on the river, suf- fered in an extreme degree. After all the help they were able to ob- tain, by hunting and from the Indians, they were obliged to subsist on acorns, malt and grains. The cattle, which could not be got over the river before winter, lived by browsing in the woods and meadows. They wintered as well, or better, than those that were brought over, and for which all the provision was made, and care taken, of which the settlers were capable. A great number of the cattle, however, perished. The Dorchester or Windsor people lost, in this species of property, about two hundred pounds sterling. Upon the breaking up of winter, and during the summer following, the settlers came in large companies, and the settlements at Windsor, Hartford and Wethersfield were firmly es tablished."], [139, "WINDSOR. 127 The original boundaries of the town of Windsor were very extensive, being about forty six miles in circumference, lying on both sides of Connecticut river. Within the limits of the town, there were ten dis tinct tribes or sovereignties. About the year 1670, it was estimated that there were in the town nineteen Indians to one Englishman. They had a large fort, a little north of the plat on which the first meeting house was erected ; but, in the language of Ossian, \" The chiefs of other times are departed. They have gone without their fame.\" Another race has arisen. \" The people are like the waves of the ocean : like the leaves of woody Morven, they pass away in the rustling blast, and other leaves lift their green heads on high.\" \" For several years after the settlement of Windsor, the people were harassed with wars. Such was the fear which agitated the minds of the inhabitants, that they repaired to a fortress nights, and slept with their arms by their side, and used to go to labor in the fields in compa nies, prepared for battle. It was the common practice on the Lord's day to go to meeting armed.\" The following is a list osthe names osthe settlers of Windsor, which appear on the records osthe town in 1640.

The Rev. John Wareham, the first minister at Windsor, died April 1st, 1670. \" He was about forty years minister in New England ; 6 at Dorchester, and 34 at Windsor. He was distinguished for his piety, and the strictest morals ; yet at times was subject to great gloominess and religious melancholy. Such were his doubts and fears, at some times, that when he administered the Lord's supper to his brethren, he did not participate with them, fearing that the seals osthe covenant did not belong to him. It is said that he was the first minister in New England who used notes in preaching, yet he was applauded by his hearers, as one of the most animated and energetic preachers of his day. He was considered as one of the principal fathers and pillars of the church of Connecticut.\" \u2014 In 1639, the Rev. Ephraim Huit was in stalled as Teacher to the church at Windsor, over which Mr. Wareham was pastor. At this period, it was the opinion of the principal divines in New England, that in every church completely organized, there should be a pastor, teacher, ruling elder, and deacons. It was the general opin-"], [140, "128 WINDSOR. ion, that the pastor's work consisted principally in exhortation ; but the teacher's business was to teach, explain and defend the doctrines of Christianity. Roger Wolcott, governor of Connecticut, was born in this town, January 4tb, 1679. \" His parents lived in a part osthe country which suffered much from the Indians, and in the town there was neither a schoolmaster nor minister, so that Mr. Wolcott was not a member of a common school for a single day in his life. When he was twelve years of age, he was bound as an apprentice to a mechanic. At the age of twenty one, when the laws permitted him to enjoy the fruits of his la bors, he established himself on the east side of Connecticut river, in the same town in which he was born, where, by the blessings of God upon his industry and frugality, he acquired what was considered as a plenti ful fortune. He is an eminent proof of the power of talents and integ rity, in a free country, in raising one to distinction, notwithstanding the disadvantages of education and of birth. He rose by degrees to the highest military and civil honors. In the expedition against Canada, in 1711, he was commissary osthe Connecticut forces, and at the capture of Louisbourg, in 1745, he bore the commission of major general. He was successively a member osthe assembly and osthe council, judge of the county court, deputy governor, chief judge of the superior court, and from 1751 to 1754, governor. He died May 17th, 1767, in the eighty ninth year of his age. In all his exaltation above his neighbors, he exhibited no haughtiness of deportment, but was easy of access, free and affable, of ready wit and great humor. His literary attainments were such, that in conversation with the learned upon most subjects he secured respect. He was much attached to the peculiar doctrines of the gospel, and was for many years a member of a Christian church. From the year 1754, when his life was more retired, he devoted him self particularly to reading, meditation and prayer. He was very care ful in searching into himself, that he might perceive his own character, and know whether he was rescued from that depravity, to which previ ously to the renewing agency of the divine Spirit the human mind is subjected, and whether he was interested in the salvation osthe gospel. In his last moments he was supported by the hopes of the Christian, and he entered into his rest. He published poetical meditations, with a preface by Mr. Bulkley of Colchester, in 1725 ; and a letter to Mr. Hobart in 1761, entitled the new English Congregational churches are and always have been consociated churches, and their liberties greater and better sounded in their platform, agreed upon at Cambridge in 1648, than in the agreement at Saybrook in 1708.

Devoting himself to the practice of law, he soon rose by the ex traordinary energy of his mind and force of his eloquence, to distin guished eminence. In 1777 he was elected a delegate to the continen tal congress, and in 1784 appointed a judge of the superior court of Connecticut. He held a seat in the convention which formed the con stitution of the United States, and was one of the most conspicuous and useful in that assembly, illustrious for learning, talents, and patriotism. On the organization of the federal government in 1789, he was elected a member of the senate, and continued in the office till he was appointed in 1796, chief judge of the supreme court of the United Slates. After discharging the duties of that station with great credit to his legal sci ence, integrity, and eloquence, for near four years, he was appointed, to wards the close of 1799, envoy extraordinary to France.

New Haven County is bounded n. by Litchfield and Hartford Counties, e. by Middlesex County, s. by Long Island Sound, and w. by Litchfield County and the Housatonic river, which separates it from Fairsield County. Its average length from east to west is about 26 miles, and its width from north to^south 21 miles; containing 540 square miles, or 345,600 acres. This county, lying on Long Island Sound, has a very extensive maritime border, but its foreign trade is chiefly confined to New Haven harbor. Its fisheries of oysters and clams, and other fish, are valuable. It is intersected by several streams, none of them of very large size, but of some value for their water power and fish. Of these the principal are the Pomperaug and Nautratuc, on the west ; the Quinnipiac, Menunkatuc, West and Mill rivers, on the east. The Quinnipiac is the largest, and passes through extensive meadows. The county is intersected centrally by the New Haven and Northamp ton Canal, which passes through this county from north to south. There is a great variety of soil in this county, as well as of native vegetable and mineral productions. The range of secondary country which extends along Connecticut river as far as Middletown, there leaves that stream, crosses into this county, and terminates at New Haven. This inter section of the primitive formation by a secondary ridge, affords a great variety of minerals, and materials for different soils. Considerable tracts on the mountains and sandy plains are of little value.

NEW HAVEN. The local situation of New Haven appears to have been known to the Dutch some years before the arrival of the English settlers ; they designated the place by the name of \" Red Mount.\" It was doubtless so called from the appearance of the East and West Rocks near the place. Its Indian name was Quinnipiac, which name was given to the river forming the eastern boundary of the township, and now com monly called Wallingsord river; to the adjacent country, and to the tribe by which it was inhabited. The Quinnipiacs have long since been extinct : they dwelt in the summer on the shore, for the conven ience of fishing ; and in the winter, in the forests, for the convenience of fuel. They had a place for powwowing in East Haven, about three quar ters of a mile east of the harbor bridge. The spot was formerly a swamp, and is now a meadow. Charles, the last sachem of this tribe, died about one hundred years ago. He was frozen to death near a spring, about one mile north of the Congregational church in East Haven. They are said to have had neither marriages nor divorces. They caught round clams with their feet, and taught the English to catch them in this manner. The Indian arrow-heads, frequently found here, are exactly like some which have been brought from Cape Horn. At Fort Hill, or, as it is now called, Beacon Hill, there was formerly an Indian fort, and an Indian burying ground, on the eastern side osthe hill. The name of this spot was formerly Indian Hill. \u2014 The above is about all the account we have osthe original inhabitants. On the 26th of July, 1637, Mr. John Davenport, Mr. Samuel Eaton, Theophilus Eaton, and Edward Hopkins, Esq.'s, Mr. Thomas Gregson, and many others of good characters and fortunes, arrived at Boston. Mr. Davenport had been a celebrated minister in the city of London, and was a distinguished character for piety, learning and good conduct. Many of his congregation, on account of the esteem which they had for his person and ministry, followed him into New England. Mr. Eaton and Mr. Hopkins had been merchants in London, possessed great es tates, and were men of eminence for their abilities and integrity. The fame of Mr. Davenport, the reputation and good estates of the principal gentlemen of this company, made the people of Massachusetts exceed ingly desirous of their settlement in that commonwealth. Great pains were taken, not only by particular persons and towns, but by the general court, to fix them in the colony. Charlestown made them large offers ; and Newbury proposed to give up the whole town to them. The gen eral court offered them any place which they should choose. But they were determined to plant a distinct colony. By the pursuit of the Pequots to the westward, the English became acquainted with that fine tract along the shore, from Saybrook to Fairfield, and with its sev eral harbors. It was represented as fruitful, and happily situated for"], [147, "NEW HAVEN. 135 navigation and commerce. They therefore projected a settlement in that part of the country. In the fall of 1637, Mr. Eaton and others, who were of the company, made a journey to Connecticut, to explore the lands and harbors on the sea coast. They pitched upon Quinnipiac for the place of their settle ment. They erected a poor hut, in which a few men subsisted through the winter: this was at the corner of Church and George streets. On the 30th of March, 1638, Mr. Davenport, Mr. Prudden, Mr. Samuel Eaton, and Theophilus Eaton, Esq., with the people of their company, sailed from Boston for Quinnipiac. In about a fortnight they arrived at their desired port. On the 18th of April they kept their first Sabbath in the place. The people assembled under a large spreading oak,* and Mr. Davenport preached to them from Matthew vi. 1. He insisted on the temptations of the wilderness, made such ob servations, and gave such directions and exhortations, as were pertinent to the then present state of his hearers. He left this remark, that he enjoyed a good day. The settlers first began to build on George street and the opposite bill, between which small vessels then passed, in a creek which for many years has been filled up. Their first houses were commodious, of two stories. One of the principal reasons which these colonists assigned for their removal from Massachusetts was, that they should be more out of the way and trouble of a general governor of New England, who at this time was an object of great fear in all the plantations. Soon after they arrived at Quinnipiac, in the close of a day of fast ing and prayer, they entered into what they termed a plantation cove nant. In this they solemnly bound themselves, \" that as in matters that concern the gathering and ordering of a church, so also in all public offices which concern civil order, as the choice of magistrates and offi cers, making and repealing laws, dividing allotments of inheritance, and all things of like nature, they would all of them be ordered by the rules which the scripture held forth to them.\" This was adopted as a gene ral agreement, until there should be time for the people to become more intimately acquainted with each other's religious views, sentiments and moral conduct ; which was supposed to be necessary, to prepare the way for covenanting together as Christians, in church state. The planters of Quinnipiac determined to make an extensive settle ment; and, if possible, to maintain perpetual peace and friendship with the Indians. They therefore paid an early attention to the making of such purchases and amicable treaties, as might most effectually answer their designs. On the 14th of November, 1638, Theophilus Eaton, Esq., Mr. Dav enport, and other English planters, entered into an agreement with Momauguin, sachem of that part of the country, and his counsellors, respecting the lands. The articles of agreement are to this effect : That Momauguin is the sole sachem of Quinnipiac, and had abso lute power to aliene and dispose of the same : that in consequence of * This tree was situated near the coiner of George and College streets; both New Haven and Milford churches were formed under it. \u2014 Dr. Dana's Sermon, 1801."], [148, "136 NEW HAVEN. the protection he had tasted, by the English, from the Pequots and Mohawks,* he yielded up all his right, title and interest, to all the land, rivers, ponds and trees, with all the liberties and purtenances belong ing to the same, unto Theophilus Eaton, John Davenport and others, their heirs and assigns forever. He covenanted, that neither he nor his Indians would terrify or disturb the English, or injure them in any of their interests ; but that, in every respect, they would keep true faith with them. The English covenanted to protect Momauguin and his Indians, when unreasonably assaulted and terrified by either of the other In dians ; and that they should always have a sufficient quantity of land to plant on, upon the east side of the harbor,! between that and Saybrook fort. They also covenanted, that by way of free and thankful retribu tion, they gave unto the said sachem and his council and company, twelve coats of English cloth, twelve alchymy spoons, twelve hatchets, twelve hoes, two dozen of knives, twelve porringers, and four cases of French knives and scissors. This agreement was signed and legally executed, by Momauguin and his council on the one part, and Theophilus Eaton and John Davenport on the other. Thomas Stanton, who was the intrepreter, declared in the presence of God, that he bad faithfully acquainted the Indians with the said articles, and returned their answers. The following signatures are marks of Momauguin and his counsellors to the above agreement, and are copied from the ancient records of New Haven, nearly in the position they stand on the record. 1.

It extended eight miles east of the river Quinnipiac, and five miles west of it towards Hudson's river. It included all the lands within the ancient limits of the old towns of New Haven, Branford and Wallingford, and almost the whole contained in the present limits of those towns, and the towns of EastHaven,Woodbridge, Bethany, Meriden, North Branford, Cheshire, Hamden, North Haven, and part of Orange. These have since been made out osthe three old towns. For this last tract the English gave 13 coats, and allowed the Indians ground to plant, and liberty to hunt within the lands. The annexed is a copy of the signature of Montowese and Sawsounck, an Indian who came with him to New Haven. Mon towese's signature is the bow and arrow. It appears the above land descended to him from his deceased mother. His tribe or company consisted of but ten men, with their women and children. The New Haven adventurers were the most opu- lent company which came into New England ; and 1^^ they designed to plant a capital colony. They laid out their town plat in squares, designing it for a great I and elegant city. In the center was a large and *\\ beautiful square. This was compassed with others, making nine in the whole. The first principal settlers were, Theophilus Eaton, Esq., Mr. Dav enport, Samuel Eaton, Thomas Gregson. Robert Newman, Matthew Gilbert, Nathaniel Turner, Thomas Fugill, Francis Newman, Stephen Goodyear, and Joshua Atwater. There appears no act of civil, military, or ecclesiastical authority, during the first year ; nor is there any appearance that this colony was ever straitened for bread, as the other colonies bad been. Meanwhile, Mr. Henry Whitfield, Win. Leet, Esq., Samuel Desbor ough, Robert Kitchel, William Chittenden, and others, who were part of Mr. Davenport's and Mr. Eaton's company, arrived to assist them in their new settlement. These were principally from Kent and Surry, in the vicinity of London. Mr. Whitfield's people, like Mr. Davenport's, followed him into New England. There were now three ministers, with many osthe members of their former churches and congregations, col lected in this infant colony, and combined in the same general agree ment. On the 4th of June, 1639, all the free planters at Quinnipiac con vened in a large barn of Mr. Newman's, and, in a formal and very sol emn manner, proceeded to lay the foundations of their civil and reli gious polity. Mr. Davenport introduced the business, by a sermon from the words of the royal preacher, \" Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars.\" The following is the most ancient record of this event, and is a curi osity in the history of civil government. 18"], [150, "138 NEW HAVEN. The 4th day osthe 4th moneth, called June 1639, all the free planters'assembled to gether in a general meetinge, to consult about settling civil government according to God, and about the nomination of persons that may be sound, by consent of all, fittest in all respects for the foundation work of a Church which was intended lo be gathered in Quinipiack. After sollemne invocation osthe name of God in prayer, for ihe pres ence and help of his spirit and grace in these weighty businesses, they were reminded of the business whereabout they met, (viz.) for the establishment of such civil order as might be most pleasing unto God and for the chusing the fittest men for the foundation work of a church to be gathered. For the belter enabling them to discerne the minde of God, and to agree accordingly concerning the establishment of civil order, Mr. John Davenport propounded divers queries to them, publicly praying them to consider se riously in the presence and feare of God, the weight of the business they met about, and not to be rash or sleight in giving their votes to things they understood not, but to digest fully and thoroughly what should be propounded to them, and without respect to men, as they should be satisfied and perswaded in their own minds to give their answers in such sort as they would be willing they should stand upon record for pos terity. This being earnestly expressed by Mr. Davenport, Mr RobertNewman wasintreat ed to write in characters, and to read distinctly and audibly in the hearing of all the people, what was propounded and accorded on, that it might appear that all consented lo matters propounded according to words written by him. Qu\u00e6re 1. \"Whether the Scriptures do holde fourth a perfect rule for the direction and government of all men in all duteyes which they are lo perform to God and men, as well in the government offamylyes and commonwealths as in matters osthe church ? This was assented unto by all, no man dissenting, as was expressed by holding up of hands. Afterwards it was read over lo them, that they might see in what wordes their vote was expressed : they againe expressed their consent thereto by holding up their hands, no man disseDting. Qu\u00e6re 2. Whereas there was a covenant sollemnely made by the whole assembly of free planters of this plantation, the first day of extraordinary humiliation that we had after we came together, thai as in matters that concern the gathering aDd ordering of a church, so likewise in all publique offices, which concern civil order, as ehoyce of ma gistrates and officers, making and repealing of laws, divideing allotments of inherit ances, and all things oflike nature, we would all of us be ordered by those rules which the scripture holds forth to us. This covenant was called a plantation covenant, to distinguish it from a church covenant, which could not at that time be made, a church not being then gathered, but was deferred till a church might be gathered according to God. It was demanded whether all the free planters doe holde themselves bound by that covenant in all business of that nature which are expressed in the covenant, to submit themselves to be ordered by the rules which are held forth in the scripture. This also was assented unto by all, and no man gainsayed it, and they did testily the same by holding up their handes, both when it was first propounded, and afterwards confirmed the same by holding up their hands when it was read unto them in pub lique. John Clark being absent when the covenant was made, doth now manifest his consent to it. Also Richard Beach, Andrew Low, Goodman Bamster, Arthur Hal bidge, John Potter, Richard Hill, John Brockett, and John Johnson, these persons be ing not admitted planters when the covenant was made, doth now expresse their con sent lo it. Qu\u00e6re 3. Those who have desired to be received as free planters, and are settled in the plantation with a purposed resolution and desire that they may be admitted into church fellowship, according lo Christ, as soon as Gon shall silt them thereunto, were desired to expresse it by holding up of hands\u2014 accordingly all did expresse this to be their desire and purpose, by holding up their hands twice, (viz.) both at the proposal of it, and after, when these written words were read unto them. Qu\u00e6re 4. All the free planters were called upon to express whether they held them selves bound to establish such civil order as might best conduce to the securing the pu rity and peace osthe ordinances to themselves and their posterity, according to God. In answer hereunto they expressed by holding up their hands twice, as before. That they helde themselves bound to establish such civil order as might best conduce to the ends aforesaid. Then Mr. Davenport declared unto them by the scriptures what kind of persons might best be trusted with matters of government, and by sundry arguments from scripture proved that such as were described, Ex. 18, 1. Dent. 1, 13. with Deut. 19 15. and 1 Cor. 6, 1 to 7, ought to be entrusted by them, seeing they were free to cast them selves into that mould and forme of commonwealth which appeareth best for them in reference lo the securing the pure and peaceable enjoyment of all Christ his ordinan ces in the church according to God, whereunto they have bound themselves as hath"], [151, "139 NEW HAVEN. been acknowledged. Having said this, he sat down, praying the company freely to consider whether they would have it voted at this time or not. Aster some space of silence, Mr. Theophilus Eaton answered it might be voted, and some others also spake to the same purpose, none at all opposing it. Then it was propounded to vote. Qu\u00e6re 5. Whether free Burgesses shall be chosen out of Church members, they that are in the foundation work of the church being actually free burgesses, and to chuse to themselves out osthe like estate of church fellowship, and the power of chu sing magistrates and officers from among themselves, and the power of making and repealing laws according to the word, and the dividing of inheritances, and the deci ding differences that may arise, and all the business oflike nature, are to be transacted by those free burgesses. This (viz. Qu\u00e6re 5.) was put to vote, and agreed unto by the listing up os hands twice, as in the former cases it was done. Then one man stood up after the vote was past, and expressing his dissenting from the rest, in that yet granting, 1. That magis trates should be men scaring God. 2. That the Church is the company whence ordi narily such men maybe expected. 3. That they that chuse them ought to be men fearing God, onelye at this he stucke, That free planters ought not to give the power out of their hands. Another stood up and answered, that in this case nothing was done but with their consent. The former answered, lhat all the free planters ought to resume this power into their own hands again, if things were not orderly carried. Mr. Theophilus Eaton answered, that in all cases they choose committees. In like manner the companys of London chuse the liverys by whom the publique magistrates are chosen. In this the rest are not wronged; because they expect to be osthe livery themselves, and to have the same power. Some others intreated the former to give his arguments and reasons whereupon he dissented. He refused to doe it, and said they might not rationally de- maund it, seeing he let the vote pass on freely, and did not speak until after it was past because he would not hinder what they agreed upon. Then Mr. Davenport, after a short relation of some former passages between them two about this question, pray ed the company that nothing might be concluded by them in this weighty qestion, but what themselves were persuaded to be agreeing with the minde of God, and they had heard what had been sayd since the vote, intreated them agayne to consider of it, and agayne to put it to vote as before. Agayne all of them by holding up their hands, did shew their consent as before. And some of them professed, that whereas they did waver before they came to the assembly, they were now fully convinced, that it is the minde of God. One of them said, that in the morning before he came, reading Deu- teronomy 17, 15. he was convinced at home. Another said that he came doubting to the assembly, but he blessed God, by what had beene said he was now fully satisfied that the choyce of burgesses out of Church members, and to intrust these with the power before spoken ot\", is according to the minde of God revealed in the scripture. All having spoken their apprehensions, it was agreed upon, and Mr. Robert Newman. was desired to write it as an order, whereunto every one that hereafter should be ad- milted here as planters should submit, and testify the same by subscribing their names to the order, namely, That church Members only shall be free Burgesses, and that they only shall chuse magistrates and officers among themselves, to have the power of transacting all pub- lique civil affairs of this plantation, of making and repealing laws, devideing of inher- itances, decideing of differences that may arise; and doing all things or businesses of like nature. This being settled as a fundamental article concerning civil government, Mr. Dav- enport propounded and proposed some things to consideration aboute the gatheringe of a Church. And to prevent Ihe blemishing osthe first beginnings osthe work, He advised that the names ol'such as were to be admitted be publiquely propounded, to the end that they who were most approved might be chosen ; for the town being casl into several private meetings, wherein they lhat dwelt nearest together gave their accounts one to another of God's gracious work upon them, and prayed together, and conferred to their mutual edification, sundry of them had knowledge one of another, and in ev ery meeting some one was more approved of all than any other. For this reason, and to prevent scandalls, Ihe whole company was intreated lo consider whom they sound fittest to nominate for this worke. Qu\u00e6re 6. Whether are you all willing and do agree in this, that twelve men be cho sen, that their fitness for the foundation work maybe tried, however there maybe more named, yet it may be in their power who are chosen to reduce ihem to twelve, and it be in the power of those twelve lo chuse out of themselves 7, that shall be most appro ved of, the major part to begin the church. This was agreed upon by consent of all, as was expressed by holding up of hands, and that so many as should be thought fit for the foundation work of a church, shall"], [152, "140 NEW HAVEN. be propounded by the plantation, and written down and passe wilhout exception, un lesse they had given public scandall or offence, yet so as in case of publique scandall and offence, every ODe should have liberty to propound their exceptions at that time publiquely against any man that should be nominated when all the names should be writ down, but if the offence were private, that men's Dames might be tendered, so ma ny as were offended, were intreated to deal with the offender privately. And if he gave no satisfaction, to brin? ihe matter lo the twelve, that they might consider of it impartially and in the seareof God. The names of the persons named and agreed upon, were Theophilus Ealon, John Davenport, Robert Newman, Matthew Gilbert, Richard Malbon, Nathaniel Turner, Ezekiel Chevers, Thomas Fugill, John Punder son, \"William Andrews, and Jeremiah Dixon. No exception was brought against any of these in public, except one about taking an excessive rate for meal lhat he had sold to one of Poquonnock in his neede, which he confessed with grief, and declared that having been smitten in heart, and troubled in bis conscience, he offered such a part of the price back again, with confession of his sin to the party, as he thought himself bound to do. And it being seared that the report of the sin was heard further than the report of his satisfaction, a course was concluded on to make the satisfaction to as ma ny as heard of the sin. It waj also agreed upon at the said meetinge, that if the per sons above named did find themselves straitened in the number of fit men for the sev en, that it should be free for them to take into tryal of silnesse such other as they should think meete. Provided that it should be signified to the town upon Ihe Lord's day who they so take in, that every man may be satisfied of them, according to the course formerly taken. [The foregoing was subscribed and signed by one hundred and eleven persons.] \" After a proper term of trial, Theophilus Eaton, Esq., Mr. John Davenport, Robert Newman, Matthew Gilbert, Thomas Fugill, John Punderson and Jeremiah Dixon, were chosen for the seven pillars of the church. \" October 25th, 1639, the court, as it is termed, consisting of these seven persons only, convened, and after a solemn address to the Su preme Majesty, they proceeded to form the body of freemen, and to elect their civil officers. The manner was indeed singular and curious. \" In the first place, all former trust, for managing the public affairs osthe plantation, was declared to cease, and be utterly abrogated. Then all those who had been admitted to the church after the gathering of it, in the choice of the seven pillars, and all the members of other appro ved churches, who desired it, and offered themselves, were admitted members of the court. A solemn charge was then publicly given them, to the same effect as the freemen's charge, or oath, which they had pre viously adopted. The purport of this was nearly the same, with the oath of fidelity, and with the freemen's administered at the present time. Mr. Davenport expounded several scriptures to them, describing the character of civil magistrates given in the sacred oracles. To this suc ceeded the election of officers. Theophilus Eaton, Esq. was chosen governor, Mr. Robert Newman, Mr. Matthew Gilbert, Mr. Nathaniel Turner, and Mr. Thomas Fugill, were chosen magistrates. Mr. Fugill was also chosen secretary ; and Robert Seely, marshal. \"Mr. Davenport gave Governor Eaton a charge in open court, from Deut. 1 : 16, 17. 'And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. Ye shall not respect persons in judgment, but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man ; for the judgment is God's : and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.\""], [153, "141 NEW HAVEN. \" It was decreed by the freemen, that there should be a general court annually, in the plantation, on the last week in October. This was ordained a court of election, in which all the officers of the colony were to be chosen. This court determined, that the word of God should be the only rule for ordering the affairs of government in that commonwealth. \" This was the original, fundamental constitution of the government of New Haven. All government was originally in the church, and the members of the church elected the governor, magistrates and all other officers. The magistrates, at first, were no more than assistants of the governor ; they might not act in any sentence or determination of the court.* No deputy governor was chosen, nor were any laws enacted, except the general resolutions which have been noticed ; but, as the plantation enlarged, and new towns were settled, new orders were giv en ; the general court received a new form, laws were enacted, and the civil polity of this jurisdiction gradually advanced, in its essential parts, to a near resemblance osthe government of Connecticut.\"! Letter from the Rev. J. Davenport and Gov. Eaton, \" To the much honored the Governor, Deputy and Assistants, Sic.\" of Massachusetts. \" It may please the worthy and much Honored Governor, Deputy & Assistants, & with them, the present Courte, lo take knowledge that our desire of staying within this patent was Reall and strong, if the eye of God's providence (to whom we have committed our waies, especially in so important an enterprise as this, which, we con fess is far above our Capaeityes) had guided us to a place convenient for our familyes, & for our friends. Which as our words have often expressed, so, we hope, the truelh thereof is sufficiently declared by our almost nine moneths patient wayting in expecla c\"on of some opportunity to be offered us, for that end, to our great charge & hin drance, many waies. \" In all which time we have, in many prayers, commended the guidance of our ap prehensions, judgments, spirits, resolucsons & wayes, into the good hand of the onely wise God, whose prerogative it is to determine the bounds of our habitac\"ons accord ing to the ends for which he hath brought us into these countryes, and we have con sidered, as we were able, by his helpe, whatsoever place hath bene propounded to us, being ready to have, with contentment accepted (if by our stay any publick good might be promoved) smaller accommodations, & upon dearer termes (it they might be mod erately commodious) then, we believe, most men, in the same case with us, in all res pects, would have done. And whereas a place for an Inland plantacon, beyond Wa tertowne, was propounded to us, & pressed with much importunity by some, whose words have the power of a law with us, in any way of God, we did speedily, and seri ously deliberate thereupon, it being the subject of the greatest part of a dayes discourse. The conclusion was, that, if the upland should answer the meddow ground in goodnes & desirablenes (whereof yet there is some ground of doubting) yet, considering that a Boate cannot pass from the Bay thither, nearer than 8 or 10 miles distance, and lhat it is so remote from the Bay, & from any towne, we could not see how our dwelling there would be advantagious to these plantations, or compatible with our conditions, or com modious for our familyes, or for our friends. \" Nor can we satisfye ourselves that it is expedient, for ourselves, or for our friends, that we chuse such a condition, wherein we must be compelled to have our dwelling houses so sarr distant from our Farmes, as Boston, or Charlestowne is from that place, few osour friends beins able to beare the charge thereof (whose cases nevertheless we are bound to consider) & some of them that are able not being persuaded that it is law full for them to live continually from the greatest part of theyre familyes, as, in this case, they would be necessitated to doe.

' John Davenporte. Theoph: Ealon. The 12th day of the first monelh, Anno 1638 \"'[= 12 March, 1639].* The above is a sac simile osthe hand-writing of Mr. Davenport and Gov. Eaton, subscribed to the preceding letter. New Haven lies at the head of a harbor, which sets up four miles from Long Island Sound ; in north latitude 41\u00b0 18', and in west longi tude 72\u00b0 56' ; seventy six miles from New York, thirty sour from Hart ford, and one hundred and thirty four from Boston. It is the capital of a county of the same name, and the semi-capital of Connecticut. The site of New Haven is a plain, lying between two ranges of hills, on the east and on the west ; and limited, partly, on the northern side, by two mountains, called the East and West Rocks ; a spur from the lat ter, named Pine Rock, and another from the former, named Mill Rock, which descends in the form of a handsome hill to the northern skirt of the city. Between these mountains the plain opens into a valley, which extends northward seventy six miles, to Northampton ; and between the East Rock, and the eastern range of hills, into another valley, ter minating at Wethersfield, thirty two miles. Both these valleys coincide at the places specified, with the valleys of Connecticut river. The mountains are bold bluffs of greenstone rocks, with summits finely fig ured, and form a delightful part osthe New Haven landscape. The harbor of New Haven is created by the confluence of three riv ers with the Sound ; Wallingsord or Quinnipiac river on the east, Mill * Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, 3d vol. 3d series."], [155, "NEW HAVEN. 143 river on the north, and West river. The two last are merely mill streams. Mill river is a very fine one, being plentifully supplied with water during the year. Wallingsord river, originally called Quinni piac, rises in Farmington, and after running a winding course of thirty five miles, empties its waters into the Sound. These streams are also ornaments of the landscape. South view of Netv Haven and Fort Hale Fort Hale, the most prominent object in the above view, is situated on an insulated rock, two miles from the end of Long Wharf. It is so named from Captain Nathan Hale, who sacrificed his life for his country in the Revolutionary war. The city of New Haven is seen in the distance, with the East and West Rocks, as they appear in sailing up the harbor. The harbor of New Haven, from the entrance of Wallingsord and Mill rivers, has in the channel fifteen feet of water to its mouth, except on Crane's bar, a small spit of sand, formed by the erection of a pier, about three fourths of a mile from the shore. Here the depth is only seven and a half feet ; but the obstruction might be removed with no great difficulty. At the time when the first settlers arrived in this town, there was in the northwestern region of this harbor, a sufficient depth of water for all the ordinary purposes of commerce. Ships were built and launched where now there are meadows, and gardens and shops : sloops loaded and unloaded where the market now stands. So late as the year 1765, the long wharf extended only twenty rods from the shore. It extends now three thousand nine hundred and forty three feet. Yet there is less water a few rods from its soot now, than at its termination in the year 1765. The substance which here accumulates so rapidly, is what in this country is called marsh mud; the material of which its salt marshes are composed. It has been suspected to be of a vegetable nature, and where the experiment has been tried, it has been found to be peat, and yields a tolerably good fire. The plain on which New Haven is built, is not improbably a conge ries of particles, floated down to this place in early times from the inte-"], [156, "144 NEW HAVEN. rior. Its surface is sand, mixed with loam and gravel ; beneath this is usually found a stratum of yellow loam. Still lower, at the depth of fifteen or eighteen inches, a mass of coarse sand extends about six feet. Beneath this is another, composed principally of pebbles, rounded and smoothed like stones washed by the ocean. Still further down, the materials, generally like those which have been mentioned, are more mingled and confused. Formerly the surface was covered with shrub oaks ; and wild turkeys and partridges were found in great numbers.* The soil of this plain is dry, warm, and naturally unproductive, but, by cultivation, is capable of producing every vegetable suited to the cli- mate, and in any quantity. For gardens, except in dry years, it is re- markably well suited. The original town was laid out on the north- western side of the harbor, in nine squares, each fifty three rods on a side ; separated by streets about sour rods in breadth ; and thus formed a quadrangular area of one hundred and sixty rods on a side. The cen- tral square is open, and is styled the Green ; and the upper, or north- western half, is a beautiful slope. It was formerly used as a burying ground, but in 1821 the monuments were removed to the new burying ground, and the ground leveled. The lower part of the square is fifty two rods long, and twenty five rods wide. It is surrounded on all sides by rows of stately elms, and is considered one of the most beautiful in the United States. The surrounding squares are, by law, divided each into four, by streets running from n. w. to s. e., and from n. e. to s. w., the direction of the original streets. Besides these thirty two squares, the town covers several considerable tracts bordering upon them, and is constantly extending. The principal of these is on the southeast side, and is called the New Township, a beautiful tract bounded by the East river and the harbor. The town of New Haven contains about eight square miles, the city about six: bounded n. by Hamden, w. by Orange and Woodbridge, s. by the waters osthe harbor, and e. by the Quinni- piac, dividing it from East Haven. New Haven contained in 1830, 10,678 inhabitants. In Dec. 1833, the population was 12,201, of which 11,534 were within the city limits. The area occupied by the city, is probably as large as that which usu ally contains a city of six times the number of inhabitants in Europe. Many of the houses have court-yards in front, and gardens in the rear. The former are ornamented with trees and shrubs ; the latter are filled with fruit trees, flowers and culinary vegetables. The houses are generally two stories high, built of wood, in a neat, handsome, but not expensive style. Many of those recently erected, however, are good and substantial edifices of brick and stone. The pub- lic edifices are, the College buildings ; twelve churches, viz., six Con- gregational, two Episcopal, two Methodist, one Baptist, and one Roman Catholic ; a tontine, a state house, a jail, four banks, a custom house and a state hospital. There are ten printing offices, from which are issued one daily, and three weekly newspapers ; and two weekly, one monthly, and one quarterly, religious publications ; and the American Journal of Science and Arts, conducted by Professor Silliman. * Dr. Dwight."], [157, "EASITETO WQEW \u00a9F TME tFOTLlKS SQUARE OK \u00abEIEN M NEW MAVENI CY"], [158, ""], [159, "NEW HAVEN. 145 Yale College. This seminary is commonly said to have been founded in the year 1700.

At their next meeting, which was at Branford, the same year, each of them brought a number of books, and presenting them to the society, said, \" 1 give these books for the founding a College in this colony.\" Antecedently to this event, the subject had been seriously canvassed by the clergy, particularly Messrs. Pierpont, Andrew, and Russell of Branford, and by the people at large, during the two preceding years ; and had come thus far towards matu rity. The act of the Legislature which gave birth to Harvard College was passed in 1636. Only ten years, therefore, elapsed after the beginning of a settlement in Mas sachusetts, before a college was commenced in earnest : whereas sixty five years pass ed away, after the colonization ofConnecticut was begun, and sixty three alter that of New Haven, before any serious attempt was made toward the sounding of Yale Col lege. But we are not hence to conclude that the colonists of Connecticut and New Haven were less friendly lo learning than those of Massachusetts. The project of establishing a college in each of these colonies was early taken up, but checked by well sounded remonstrances from the people of Massachusetts, who very juslly observ ed lhat the whole population of New England was scarcely sufficient to support one institution of this nature, and that the establishment of a second would, in the erid, be a sacrifice of both. These considerations put a stop to the design for a-considerable lime. 19"], [160, "146 NEW HAVEN. Of the serious intention of the New Haven colonists to establish a college the fol lowing document, copied from the records of Guilford, furnishes decisive evidence. \"Al a General Court, held at Guilford, June 28, A. D. 1652.\" \"Voted, The matter about a College at New Haven, was thought to be too great a charge for us of this jurisdiction to undergo alone ; especially considering the unset- tled stale of New Haven Town ; being publicly declared, from the deliberate judg- ment of the most understanding men, to be a place of no comfortable subsistence tor the present inhabitants there. But if Connecticut do join, the planters are generally willing to bear their just proportions for erecting and maintaining of a College there. However, they desire thanks to Mr. Goodyear, for his kind proffer to the setting tor- ward of such a work.\" In October, 1701, the Legislature granted the before named gentlemen a charter, conslituting them \"Trustees of a Collegiate School in his Majesty's Colony of Con- necticut;\" and invested them with all the powers which were supposed to be neces- sary for Ihe complete execution of their trust. The following November, they chose one of their number, Mr. Pierson, rector of the school, and determined that it should be fixed for the present al Saybrook. In the year 1702, the first commencement was held at Saybrook, at which five young gentlemen received the degree of A. M. Prom this time many debates arose concerning the place where the school should finally be established, and continued to agitate the community, until the year 1718. In 1716, a majority of the trustees voted, on the I7th ofOctobei,to remove the school to New Haven. Four of their number, out of nine, were however strongly against it; and the community was equally disunited. The trustees, nevertheless, proceeded to hold the commencement, the following year, at New Haven, and to order a college lo be erected. It was accordingly raised in October, 1717, and finished the following year. This building they were enabled to erect by a considerable number of dona- tions, which they had received for this purpose, both within and without the colony. Their principal benefactor, both during this period and all which have succeeded, was the Legislature. Among the individuals who distinguished themselves by their beneficence to this infant institution, was the Hon. Elihu Yale, Esq., of London. This gentleman was descended from an ancient and respectable family in \"Wales. His father, Thomas Yale, Esq., came from England with the first colonists of New Haven. In this town his son Elihu was b irn, April 5th, 1648. He went lo England at ten years ofage, and to Hindooslan at thirty. In that country he resided about twenty years; was made governor of Madras; and married the widow of Governor Hinmers, his predecessor. Having acquired a targe fortune, he returned to London ; was chosen governor of ihe East India Company; and died al Rexon, July 8th, 1721. This gentleman sent, in several donations, to the collegiate school, \u00a3500 sterling, between 1714 and 1718 ; and, a little before his death, ordered goods lo be sent oul to the value of \u00a3500 more, bui they were never received. In gratitude lo this benefactor, the trustees, by a solemn act, named their seminary Yale College; a name which, it is believed, will convey the memory of his beneficence to distant generations.* The college w\"hich was erected at this time, was built of wood, one hundred and seventy feet song, twenty two feet wide, and three stories high ; contained near filly studies, besides the hall, library and kitchen, and cost about \u00a31000 sterling. Before it was erected, the students were scattered in various places, as Milford, Killingworth, Guilford, Saybrook, \"Wethersfield, &c. Soon afterwards, they all removed lo New Haven. From this time the institution began to flourish. The number of the students was about 40, and the course of education was pursued with spirit. The benefac- tions, also, which it received, were increased in number and value. In the list of ils principal benefactors was the Rev. Dr. Berkeley, dean of Deny in Ireland, and afterwards bishop of Cloyne. This highly respectable man came to America in the year 1732, for the purpose of establishing a college in the island of Bermuda. The project sailed, however, for want os assistance from England, which was promised him. While he was in America, he became acquainted with the Rev. Mr. \"Williams, and with the design and circumstances of the seminary. \"With all these he was so well pleased, that he made a present to it of a farm, which he had purchased at Rhode Lland; and after his return to Europe, sent to the library \" the .finest collection of books that ever came together at one lime into America. \"t Jere .miah Dummer, Esq. of Boston, and the Hon.

Sir Isaac Newton, Sir Richard Steele, Doctors Burnet, Woodward, Halley, Bently, Kennel, Calamy, Ed wards, the Rev. Mr. Henry, and Mr. Whiston, presented iheir own works to the library. Many other respectable men afterwards made similar presents. In 1745, a new charter, drawn by the Hon. Thomas Fitch, Esq. of Norwalk, afterwards governor, was given to the trustees, in which they were named, The President and Fellows of Yale College. This is the present charter of the institution. In the year 1750, another college was built, and named Connecticut Hall. The building, as originally constructed, was 100 feet long, 40 feet wide, and three stories high, with a cellar under the whole. It was built of brick, and contained thirty two chambers, and sixty two studies. This is the only college of that period that now remains, and even this has been essentially altered and enlarged by the addition of a fourth story. It is known in the language of direction now used by the students, as the South Middle College. The expense of this building was \u00a31,660 sterling. In April, 1761, a chapel was begun, and finished in 1763. This chapel, in modern times, has undergone much alteration, and is at this time devoted solely to academic purposes, under the name of the Athen\u00e6um. In 1782, a brick dining ball was erected, sixty feet in length, and thirty in breadth. This hall has since been converted into a chemical laboratory and lec ture room, and is now used for these purposes. In April, 1793, the corner stone of the building usually designated as the South College was laid. This building is of brick, one hundred and four feet long, thirty six feet wide, and sour stories high, and was completed on the 17th of July, 1794. The faculty, to whom is committed the government and instruction osthe students, consists of a president ; a professor of chem istry, mineralogy, and geology ; a professor of the Latin language and literature ; a professor of mathematics, natural philosophy and astrono my ; a professor of divinity ; a professor of rhetoric and oratory ; a pro fessor of the Greek language and literature ; and eight tutors. The whole course of instruction occupies four years. In each year there are three terms or sessions. The general library of Yale College consists of above ten thousand volumes, exclusive of pamphlets. The libraries of the Linonian Society, and of the Brothers in Unity, comprise each rather more than five thousand volumes. The Calliopean Society, which is com paratively of recent formation, has made a collection of three thou sand eight hundred volumes. In addition to the several libraries, there is a collection of books belonging to the Moral Society, con sisting of five or six hundred volumes. The aggregate of books in the several libraries, is about twenty five thousand volumes. The col lege possesses a handsome mineralogical cabinet. In 1811, Col. George Gibbs deposited in this seminary two cabinets, one consisting of more than six thousand choice specimens, and the other of about eighteen thousand, the two best collections ever opened in this country. In 1825, this collection was purchased of Colonel Gibbs, at a price of twenty thousand dollars ; of which sum the officers of Yale College and the citizens of New Haven contributed ten thousand dollars, the"], [162, "148 NEW HAVEN. citizens of New York three thousand dollars, and the alumni of South Carolina seven hundred dollars, and an individual five hundred dollars.* The principal edifices of Yale College face the western boundary of the green, and present an imposing front, including passage ways, of upwards of eight hundred feet. The buildings are chiefly constructed of brick, and consist of five spacious edifices, each four stories high, one hundred and four feet by forty, containing thirty two studies ; a chapel for religious worship, and ordinary public exhibitions ; a Ly ceum, containing the library and recitation rooms ; an Athen\u00e6um ; a chemical laboratory; an extensive stone dining hall, containing also, in the upper story, apartments for the mineralogical cabinet ; a separate dining hall for theological students; a dwelling house for the presi dent ; a large stone building occupied by the medical department ; and the Trumbull Gallery, a neat and appropriate building, erected as a repository for the valuable historical and other paintings of Col. Trumbull. In the cut, the first building with a tower, on the left, is the old chap el or Athen\u00e6um ; that on the right is the new chapel, erected in 1824. The middle building is the Lyceum. There are many more trees in the yard in front of the college buildings, than are represented in the cut, but it was thought advisable not to insert the whole number, as it would much obscure the view osthe buildings. The last college build ing was erected in 1835 ; it stands in a range with the others, north of those seen in the engraving.

With funds obtained from these sources, the society have erected a neat building on an eminence south westerly from the densely peopled part of the city ; commanding an excellent view of the town and harbor, and Long Island sound, to gether with the distant ridge of hills which appear to skirt the horizon on every side except that bounded by the water. The building was completed in July, 1832. It consists of a center and two wings, its whole length being one hundred and eighteen feet ; its breadth in the center is forty eight feet. The number of rooms is about twenty, be sides those in the basement, and a large room for operations in the attic story. The building is of stone, stuccoed on the outside. In front of the center is a portico with four columns, constructed after the best Grecian models. The whole expense of the building was about twelve thousand dollars. The funds of the society being limited, it was not deemed prudent to build on a more expensive scale at present. Should more room at any suture time be wanted, additions can be made to any extent required, without injuring the appearance osthe edifice. \" The design of this institution is to afford medical and surgical aid, and other necessaries of sickness, to such as cannot command such ne cessaries elsewhere. The poor, whom we ' always have with us,' if wounded or taken sick, without possessing the means of procuring ne cessary aid, will here find an asylum, infinitely superior to that, but too often resorted to, in the town alms-houses. The stranger, sojourning with us, taken ill at a public boarding-house, with no friend or relative to care for him, may here find a substitute for the affectionate attentions of home. The sick mariner will here find a ' snug harbor.' To the poor every thing will be gratuitously furnished, board, bed, medicines, nursing, and medical and surgical aid. Such as are wealthy, and may choose to become inmates of the hospital, will be expected to pay for board only. All medical and surgical aid is to be in all cases gratuitous. It is to be essentially a charitable institution ; and, should more apply than can be received, the poor are always to have the preference over those who are able to pay for their accommodations.\" The cut on the next page is a representation of the southern termina tion of West Rock and a part of the village of Westville, (formerly known by the name of Hotchkisstown,) about two miles n. w. from the state house in New Haven. That part of West Rock seen in the engraving, is about 400 feet in height, and is similar in its formation and general appearance to the East Rock, about two miles n. e. from New Haven. These rocks are trap, and are composed of hornblende and feldspar : iron enters considerably into their composition ; hence, during their decompo sition, iron rust gradually covers the exterior of the stone, thus giving it a reddish brown appearance. It forms an excellent building stone, and is extensively employed for that purpose in New Haven. Their fronts are composed of vast assemblages of columns, more or less regular, and are full of cracks and fissures, from which cause it probably arises that they are liable to break off and fall. Hence vast masses of broken rocks, from the smallest size to that of the largest columns, are found sloping"], [164, "150 NEW HAVEN. Southeastern view of West Rock and Weslville. from the bases of these mountains up their fronts, for more than half their height. They are also distinguished by their backs declining so gradually that whilst the ascent is often easy, in front it is impracticable. The above view was taken from the sandy bluff rising at the east ern extremity osthe village. The building seen on the extreme left in the distance, is the Congregational church. The Methodist house of worship is seen in the distance, at the base of West Rock, in the cen ter of the engraving. There are three paper mills, one iron soundery, and some other manufacturing establishments in the village, which con tains about 600 inhabitants. The two Judges of King Charles I., Goffe and Whalley, (commonly called the Regicides,) on the restoration of Charles II. to the throne of his father, in order to save their lives were obliged to flee the kingdom : they arrived at Boston from England, the 27th of July, 1660, and took up their residence in Cambridge; but finding it un safe to remain any longer, they left that place and arrived at New Haven the 7th of March, 1661. They were well treated by the min ister and magistrates, and for some days thought themselves entirely out of danger. But the news of the king's proclamation being brought to New Haven, they were obliged to abscond. The 27th of March they returned, and lay concealed in the house of Mr. Davenport, the minister, until the 30th of April. Mr. Davenport was threatened with being called to an account, for concealing and comforting traitors ; but the Judges, who had before removed from Mr. D.'s house, upon intima tion of his danger, generously resolved to deliver themselves up to the authorities of New Haven. They accordingly let the deputy governor, Mr. Leete, know where they were ; but he took no measures to secure them ; and the next day, some of their friends came to them and advised"], [165, "NEW HAVEN. 151 them not to surrender. Having publicly shown themselves at New Haven, they bad cleared Mr. Davenport from the suspicion of conceal ing them ; after which they returned to their cave, which still goes by the name osthe Judges' Cave. It is situated on the top of West Rock, about half or three quarters of a mile from the southern extremity. It is a place well chosen for observing any approach to the mountain ; likewise any vessel coming into the harbor, can from this rock be easily seen. The cave is formed on a base of perhaps forty feet square, by huge broad pillars of stone, fifteen or twenty feet high, standing erect and elevated above the surrounding superficies of the mountain, surroun ded with trees, which conceal it from observation. The apertures be ing closed with branches of trees, or otherwise, a well covered and con venient lodgment might be formed, as these rocks, being contiguous at the top, furnished space below large enough to contain bedding and two or three persons. Mr. Richard Sperry, who lived on the west side osthe Rock, about a mile from this cave, supplied them daily with food, sometimes carrying it himself, and at other times sending it by his boys, tied up in a cloth, with directions to leave it on a certain stump, from which the Judges would take it. South vieiv of the Judges' Cave The incident which caused them to leave the cave was this ; the mountain being a haunt for wild animals, one night as the Judges lay in bed, a panther or catamount, putting his head into the aperture of the cave, blazed his eye-balls in such a frightful manner as greatly to terrify them. One of them took to his heels, and fled down to Sperry's house for safety. Considering this situation too dangerous to remain any longer, it was abandoned. Another place of their abode, in the vicinity of New Haven, was at a spot called the Lodge. It was situated at a spring, in a valley, about three miles west, or a little northwest, from the last mentioned residence. North of it was an eminence, called the Fort to this day, from which"], [166, "152 NEW HAVEN. there was full view of the harbor, tc the southeast, seven miles off. There were several other places on and about the West Rock, which were used by them for places of concealment. The two mentioned, however, were their principal places. Among the many traditionary anecdotes and stories, concerning the events which took place at and about the time the Judges' pursuers were at New Haven, are the following : \u2014 1. The day they were expected, the Judges walked out towards the Neck bridge, the road the pursuers must enter the town. At some dis- tance from the bridge, the sheriff, who then was Mr. Kimberly, over- took them, with a warrant for their apprehension, and endeavored to take them. The Judges stood upon their defense, and planted themselves behind a tree ; being expert at fencing, they defended themselves with their cudgels, and repelled the officer, who went into town to obtain assistance, and upon his return, sound they had escaped into the woods beyond his reach. 2. That immediately after this, during the same day, the Judges hid themselves under the Neck bridge, where they lay concealed while the pursuivants rode over it and passed into town ; and that the Judges re- turned to New Haven that night and lodged at the house of Mr. Jones. All this tradition says, was a preconcerted and contrived business, to show that the magistrates of New Haven had used their endeavors to apprehend them before the arrival of the pursuers. 3. That when the pursuers were searching the town, the Judges in shifting their situations, happened, by accident or design, at the house of a Mrs. Eyers, a respectable lady ; she seeing the pursuivants coming, ushered her guests out at the back door, who after walking a short dis- tance, instantly returned to the house, and were concealed by her in one of the apartments. The pursuers coming in, inquired whether the re- gicides were at her house ; she answered, they had been there, but were just gone away, and pointed out the course they went into the woods and fields ; by her polite and artful address, she diverted their attention from the house, and putting them upon a false scent, thereby secured her friends. 4. That while the Judges were at the house of Mr. Richard Sperry, they were surprised by an unexpected visit from their pursuers, whom they espied at a distance, as the causeway to the house lay through a morass, on each side of which was an impassable swamp. They were seen by the Judges, when several rods from the house, who therefore had time to make their escape to the mountain. 5. At or about the time the pursuers came to New Haven, and per haps a little before, to prepare the minds of the people for their recep tion, the Rev. Mr. Davenportpreacbed publicly from this text. Isaiah, xvi. 3, 4. \u2014 Take counsel, execute judgment, make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday ; hide the outcasts, betray not him that wandereth. Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab ; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler. This doubtless had its effect, and put the whole town upon their guard, and united the people in caution and concealment."], [167, "153 NEW HAVEN. 6. To show the dexterity of the Judges at fencing, the following story is told : that while at Boston, there appeared a fencing master, who, on a stage erected for the purpose, walked it for several days, challeng ing and defying any one to play with him at swords ; at length, one of the Judges disguised in a rustic dress, holding in one band a cheese, wrapped in a napkin, for a shield, with a broomstick, the mop of which he had besmeared with dirty puddle water as he passed along \u2014 thus equipped, mounted the stage. The fencing master railed at him for his impudence, asked him what business he had there, and bid him be gone. The Judge stood his ground, upon which the gladiator made a pass at him with his sword to drive him off \u2014 a rencounter ensued \u2014 the Judge received the sword into the cheese, and held it until he drew the mop osthe broom gently over his mouth and gave the gentleman a pair of whiskers. He made another pass, and plunging his sword a second time, it was caught and held in the cheese, whilst the mop was drawn gently over his eyes. At a third lunge, it was again caught and held in the cheese, until the Judge had rubbed the broom all over his face. Upon this the gentleman let fall his small sword, and took up the broad sword. The Judge then said, \" stop, sir ; hitherto, you see, I have only played with you, and not attempted to harm you ; but if you come at me now with the broad sword, know that I will certainly take your life.\" The firmness with which he spoke struck the master, who, desisting, exclaimed, \" Who can you be ? You must be either Goffe, Whalley, or the Devil, for there was no other man in England that could beat me.\" On the 13th of October, 1664, they left New Haven, and arrived at Hadley the latter part of the same month. During their abode at Had- ley, the famous Indian war, called \" King Philip's ivar,\" took place. The pious congregation of Hadley were observing a fast on the occasion of this war, and being at public worship in the meeting house, Sept. 1st, 1675, were suddenly surrounded by a body of Indians. It was customary in the frontier towns, and even at New Haven, in these Indian wars, for a select number of the congregation to go armed to public worship. It was so at Hadley at this time. The people immediately took to their arms, but were thrown into great confusion. Had Hadley been taken, the discovery osthe Judges would have been unavoidable. Suddenly, and in the midst of the people, there appeared a man of very venerable aspect, and different from the inhabitants in his apparel, who took the command, arranged and ordered them in the best military manner. Under his direction, they repelled and routed the enemy, and thereby saved the town. He immediately vanished, and the inhabit- ants could account for the phenomenon in no other way, but by consid- ering that person as an angel sent by God, upon that special occasion for their deliverance ; and for some time after said and believed, that they had been saved by an angel. Nor did they know otherwise, till fifteen or twenty years after, when at length it became known at Hadley that the two Judges had been secreted there. The angel was Goffe, for Whalley was superannuated in 1675. The last account of Goffe is from a letter dated ' Ebenezer, (the name they gave their several places of 20"], [168, "154 NEW HAVEN. abode,) April 2, 1769.' Whalley bad been dead some time before. The tradition at Hadley is, that they were buried in the minister's cel lar, and it is generally supposed that their bodies were afterwards se cretly conveyed to New Haven, and placed near Dixwell's. The sup position is strongly confirmed, by three stones yet remaining in the old burying ground, at New Haven, in the rear osthe Center church, which are marked E. W. for Whalley, M. G. for Goffe, and J. D. Esq. for Dixuell. The following is a correct copy of each of the E. W. stones. The reader will observe in the cut, that the date on Whalley's head-stone may be read 1658, which was about twenty years before his death. The extension, however, of the line, in a direct course beyond the curve of the 5, has the aspect of design for concealment. The inscription upon the soot-stone E. W. and the three figures 16-8 are plain and distinct, but the intermediate figure is obscure. In the date of the foot-stone, the 5 is discernible ; the upper line osthe 7 is also obvious ; it may be read, therefore, 1658 or 1678, and there is little doubt but that the lat ter was the date intended, as, according to Goffe's letter to bis wife, Whalley died about this time. head stone, 2 feet wide and high, 8 inches thick. \u2014 Dark blue sione.

(see cut,) which was evi dently intentional. 80, over these initials, may be referred to the year of bis death, for his last letter was dated 1679, and he disappeared soon after.* The object of these inscriptions being so obscure, was doubtless to prevent a discovery of their burial place, by their enemies, who, it was justly feared, if in their power to have obtained the bodies of the regicides, would have carried their re- sentment beyond the grave. A royalist historian, in speaking of Goffe, thus remarks: \"In 1660, a little before the restoration of King Charles 2d, he betook himself to his heels to save his neck, without any regard had to his majesty's pro- clamation, wandered about, fearing every one that he met should slay him ; and was living at Lausanna in 1664, with Edward Ludlow, Ed- ward Whalley, and other regicides, when John Lisle, another of that number, was there, by certain generous royalists, dispatched. He af- terwards lived several years in vagabondship, but when he died, or where his carcass was buried, is as yet unknown to me.\" Colonel John Dixwell came from Hadley to New Haven before the year 1672, and was known here by the name of James Davids. During the seventeen years or more in which he lived in New Haven, nothing extraordinary occurred concerning him. From 1674 to 1685, the church had no settled minister with whom he might associate. The Rev. Nicholas Street, the minister at his first coming here, soon died. For above eleven years, the church was destitute of a pastor, and sup- plied by occasional and temporary preaching only, until Mr. Pierpont's settlement in 1685. With him the Colonel entered immediately into an open and unreserved communication ; but this was only for the short space of three or four osthe last years of his exile. During this short time, however, there was the greatest intimacy between them, which appears to have been concealed even from the minister's wife. For tradition says, that madam Pierpont, observing their remarkable intima- cy, and wondering at it, used to ask him what he saw in that old gentle- man, who was so fond of leading an obscure, unnoticed life, that they should be so intimate and take such pleasure in being together, for Mr. Dixwell's house being situated on the east corner of College and Grove streets, and Mr. Pierpont's near the corner of Elm and Temple streets, and their house lots being contiguous and cornering upon one another, they had beaten a path in walking across their lots to meet and con- verse together at the fence. In answer lo his wife's question, Mr. Pierpont remarked, that the old gentleman was a very learned man, and understood more about religion, and all other subjects, than any other person in the place, and that if she knew the value of him, she * See Stiles' History osthe Judges."], [170, "156 NEW HAVEN. would not wonder at their intimacy. Among other traditionary anec dotes concerning him, this is one. r \" Sir Edmund Andross came into America, and became governor ol New York in 1075 to 1684, and of Massachusetts from 168b to lo\u00abJ. In one of bis tours through the colony of Connecticut, about lobo, at tending public worship at New Haven, he observed a venerable old gentleman at meeting, and noticing him closely, discerned something singular in him and suspected him. After meeting be inquired who that person was, and was told that he was a merchant who resided in town. Sir Edmund replied that he knew that he was not a merchant, and became particularly inquisitive about him. Probably Colonel D. was notified osthe inquisitiveness of the stranger concerning his person and character, for the Colonel was not seen at meeting in the after- noon.\" In connection with this, another tradition makes mention of a circum stance indicating bow obnoxious Sir Edmund was at New Haven, as well as through New England. He being at meeting here, and proba bly on the same Lord's day as the above, the deacon gave out the 52d psalm to sing, in Sternhold and Hopkins' version, which begins thus; \"Why dost thou tvrant boast abroad, Thy wicked works to praise 1 Do^t thou not know there is a God, Whose mercies last always? \"Why dost thy mind yet still devise Such wicked wiles to warp ? Thy tongue untrue, in forging lies, Is like a razor sharp. Thou dost delight in fraud and guile, In mischief, blood, and wrong : Thy lips have learned the flattering stile, O false, deceitful tongue! Governor Andross felt it as an intended insult upon himself, and after meeting resented it as such, and reprehended the deacon for it. But being told that it was the usage of the church to sing the psalms in course, he excused the deacon and let the matter drop. But it is not improbable, that though this might be the general custom, yet in this instance a psalm was selected for Sir Edmund's contemplation. Colonel Dixvvell carried on no secular business, but employed his time in reading and walking in the groves and woods adjacent to bis bouse. Mr. Pierpont had a large library, from which, as well as from his own collection, he could be supplied with a variety of books. He often spent his evenings at Mr. Pierpont's, and when they were by themselves, retired to his study, where they indulged themselves with great familiarity and humor, and had free and unrestrained conversation upon all matters, whether of religion or politics. But when in company, Mr. Pierpont behaved towards Colonel D. with caution and reserve. The Colonel spent much of his retirement in reading history, and as a token of his friendship for Mr. Pierpont, he, in his last will, presented him with Raleigh's History of the World,"], [171, "NEW HAVEN. 157 Aster a pilgrimage of twenty nine years in exile from his native country, and banishment into oblivion from the world, of which seven teen yeas at least, probably more, were spent in New Haven, by the name of James Davids, Esq. Colonel Dixwell died in this place. He ai d all the other Judges lived and died in the firm expectation of a revolution in England. This had actually taken place the Novem ber before his death, but the news not having arrived, he died ignorant of it, al out a month before the seizure of Sir Edmund Andross at Bos ton. At his death, he discovered his true character to the people, and owned the name of John Dixwell, but requested that no monument should be erected at his grave, giving an account of his person, name, and character, alledging as a reason, \" lest his enemies might dishonor his ashes\" \u2014 requesting that only a plain stone might be set up at his grave, inscribed with his initials, J. D. Esq., with his age and time of his death. Accordingly, a plain rough stone was erected at his grave, close by the graves of Governor Eaton and Governor Jones, charged with this inscription, as at first put up and engraved by his friends. The following is a correct copy, both of the shape of the stone and the in scription upon it. lo IXes<^ ) U\u00c6CJSJSJSD M\u00c6A'CMy 1 \\mthmj 82, ISear of I | mis^nsm n6s89 J 2\\ feet high and broad, 5 inches thick : \u2014 red stone. Whilst residing at New Haven he was twice married, and at his death he left a wife and two children. His will was afterwards exhibited, approved and recorded in the probate office. President Stiles, in his History of the Judges, says: \"So late as the last French war, 1760, some British officers passing through New Haven, and hearing of Dixwell's grave, visited it, and declared with rancorous and malicious vengeance, that if the British ministry knew it, they would even then cause their bodies to be dug up and vilified. Often have we heard the crown officers aspersing and vilifying them ; and some, so late as 1775, visited and treated the graves with marks of in dignity too indecent to be mentioned.\" It was especially so in Queen Anne's time, and even in that of the Hanoverian family, there has been no time in which this grave has not been threatened by numerous syco phantic crown dependents, with indignity and ministerial vengeance."], [172, "158 NEW HAVEN. South view of Fair Haven, (western part.) The above is a representation of that part of Fair Haven which lies within the present city limits of New Haven. This flourishing village is situated about two miles eastward of the Court House, on both sides of the Quinnipiac, and contains about one thousand inhabitants. The village, which is nearly equally divided, is connected by a bridge, which is seen in the distance, on the right of the engraving. The Methodist church, erected in 1835, is seen on the left ; the Congregational church appears in the central part of the engraving. A building with a small tower is seen a little to the left ; this is the \" Collegiate and Practical Institute,\" which has just been erected, and where all the higher branches of education are intended to be taught. The oyster trade is the leading business of the inhabitants, and is steadily increasing. It commences in October and closes in April. \" There are oysters brought here from different places, but the largest amount is from Virginia. The last season (1835 and 1836) there were brought from the North river 12,000 bushels, making 130,841 bushels brought here in the season.\" Many of these oysters are laid down in beds. The quantity taken in Fair Haven varies from 20,000 to 40,000 bushels yearly : from 300 to 400 boats are engaged in taking them. In the summer of 1835 there were brought into the village 5,000 bushels of round clams, of which 2,000 were caught in the vi cinity. It is estimated that there are dug on our shores, every season, 4,000 bushels of long clams. There are twenty vessels owned in this village, whose whole amount of tonnage is 1,188 tons: six of these are engaged in the West India trade a part of the season, and the others in the coasting business. There is a large amount of excellent stone, for building and other purposes, sound in the village ; and the getting it out during the spring"], [173, "NEW HAVEN. 159 and summer season receives considerable and increasing attention. In 1835, there were quarried by different companies 270,000 solid feet. \"This year (1836) there is going into operation the manufacture of lime from oyster shells ; and the person who is engaged in the business calculates there may be made 200,000 bushels in a year.\" \" The population and business in general is constantly increasing, and there is every promise of this being one of the most prosperous villages in the State.\" \u2014 This place was formerly called Dragon, from a sandy point of that name, about forty rods below the bridge, on the eastern side of the river. The tradition is, that at the time of the first settle ment of New Haven this point was a place of resort for seals, which lay here and basked themselves in the sun. At that time these animals were called dragons, hence the name Dragon Point. That part of New Haven which lies between the nine original squares and Mill River, is called the New Township. Within a few years this part of the city has rapidly increased, and contains two of the most ex tensive coach-making establishments in this country. There are within the city limits twelve coach-making establishments ; and it is estimated that the value of the carriages manufactured at present, will amount to about half a million of dollars annually. There are also four coach spring and step manufactories, and five plating establishments. The manufacture of boots and shoes, ready made clothing, cabinet work, chairs, &tc., are important branches of industry in this place. There has been put in operation an establishment for the manufacture of car peting of a superior quality ; also, three iron sounderies. There are many other articles besides those mentioned, manufactured in the place. It is believed that there is not in ihe Union a body of working men more distinguished for their general intelligence and morality, than are the mechanics of New Haven. The following is a list of the planters, and the persons numbered in their families, with an estimate of their estates, in 1643. It was ordered that every planter should give in the names of the heads or persons in his family, wherein his wife, together with himself and children only were reckoned, with an estimate of his estate, accor ding to which he will pay his proportion in all rates and public charges, from time to time to be assessed for civil uses, and expect lands in all divisions which shall generally be made to the planters.

Whenever any plan ter disposed of his land, it was passed to his credit on said book, and diminished his taxes in proportion to the quantity sold; each purchaser was made debtor, and his taxes were increased in proportion to the quantity bought.

New Haven having been exceedingly disappointed in trade, and sus tained great damages at Delaware, and the large estates which they brought into New England rapidly declining, this year made uncommon exertion, as far as possible to retrieve their former losses. Combining their money and labors, they built a ship at Rhode Island, of 150 tons; and freighted her for England, with the best part of their commercial estates. Mr. Gregson, Capt. Turner, Mr. Lamberton, and five or six of their principal men embarked on board. They sailed from New Haven in January, 1647. They were obliged to cut through the ice to get out of the harbor. The ship foundered at sea, and was never heard of after she sailed. According to the belief of the inhabitants at that period, this ship was S9en in the air after she was lost. We take the following account as we find it in Mather's Magnalia. Mather, hearing of ihe circumstances, wrote to his friend, the Rev. Mr. Pierpont, for information, and received from that gentleman the following answer : \u2014 Reverend and Dear Sir \u2014 In compliance with your desires, I now give you the relation of that apparition of a skip in the air, which I have received from the most credible, judicious and curious surviving observers of it. In the year 1647, besides much other lading, a far more rich treasure of passengers, (five orsix of whieh were persons oschiesnote and worth in New Haven,) pnt them- selves on board a new ship, built at Rhode Island, of about 150 tuns; but so walty, that the master (Lamberton) often said she would prove their grave. In the month of Jan- uary, cutting their way through much ice, on which they were accompanied with the Reverend Mr. Davenport, besides many other friends, with many fears, as well as prayers and tears, they set sail. Mr. Davenport, in prayer, with an observable empha- sis, used these words : Lord if it be thy pleasure to bury these our friends in the bottom of the sea, they are thine; save them! The spring following no tidings of these friends arrived wilh the ships from England: New Haven's heart began to fail her: this pnt the goodly people on much prayer, both publick and private, that the Lord would (if it was his pleasure) let them hear what he had done with their dear friends, and prepare them xoilh a suitable submission to his Holy Will. In June next ensuing, a great thun- der storm arose out of the north west; after which (the hemisphere being serene) about an hour before sun-set, a ship of like dimensions with the aforesaid, with her canvass and colors abroad, (though the wind northernly,) appeared in the air coming up from our harbour's mouth, which lyes southward from the town, seemingly with her sails filled under a fresh gale, holding her course north, and continuing under observation, sailing against the wind for the space of half an hour. Many were drawn to behold this great work of God; yea, the very children cryed out, There's a brave ship! At length, erouding up as far as there is usually water suf- ficient for such a vessel, and so near some of the spectators, as that they imagined a man might hurl a stone on board her, her main-top seemed to be blown off, but left hanging in the shrouds; then her mizen-top; then all her masting seemed blown away by the board: quickly aster the hulk brought unto a careen, she overset, and so vanished into a smoaky cloud, which in some time dissipated, leaving, as every where else, a clear air. The admiring spectators could distinguish the several colours of each part, the principal rigging, and such proportions as caused not only the general- ity of persons to say, This was the mould of their ship, and this was her iragick end: but Mr. Davenport also in publick declared to this effect : That God had condescended, for the quieting of their ajjlicted spirits, this extraordinary account of his sovereign dis posal of those for whom so many fervent prayers were made continually. Thus I am, Sir, your humble servant, James Pierpont. The loss of this ship, with the former losses which the company had sustained, broke up all their expectation with respect to trade, and as they conceived themselves disadvantageously situated for husbandry, they adopted the design of leaving the country. Accordingly they en tered into treaties for the city of Galloway in Ireland, which they de- 21"], [176, "162 NEW HAVEN. signed to have settled, as a small province for themselves. They were however disappointed with respect to all these designs, and their pos terity, who they seared would be reduced to beggary, made respectable farmers, and nourished no less than their neighbors. It appears that the first planters had no written code of laws. The court determined all differences, fee, according to their views of justice and propriety, as occasion required. The following extracts are taken from the ancient Records of New Haven during this period. Ata Court held at New Haven, A. D. 1643\u2014 Andrew Low, jun., for breaking into Mr. Laing's house, where he brake open a cupboard and took from thence some strong Water, and Gd. in money, and ransackt the house from roome to roome, and left open the doors, for which fact being committed to prison, broke forth and escaped, and still remains horrible obstinate and rebellious against his parents, and incorrigible under all the means that have been used to reclaim him. Whereupon it was orderd that he shall be as severely whipt as the rule will bear, and work with his father as a pris oner, with a lock upon his leg so lhat he may not escape.

When I undertook the office of Distributor of Stamps for this colony, I meant a service to you, and really thought you would have viewed it in that light when you come to understand the nature of the stamp act and that of the office ; but since it gives you some uneasiness, you maybe assured if I find (after the act takes place, which is the first of November) that you shall not incline to purchase or make use of any stampt Paper, I shall not force it upon you, nor think it worth my while to trouble you or myself with any exercise of my office ; but if, by that time, I should find you generally in much need of the stampt paper, and very anxious to obtain it, I shall hope you will be willing to receive it of me, (if I shall happen to have any) at least until another person more agreeable to you can be appointed in my room. I cannot but wish you would think more how to get rid of the stamp act than osthe Officers who are to supply you with the Paper, and that you had learnt more of the nature of my office, before you had undertaken to be so very angry at it.

The Slamp Master General of this Colony was at the said meeting, where these words were read aloud, ''Likewise voted that the Freemen present earnestly desire Mr. Ingersoll to resign his Slamp Office imme diately.\" Numerous were the signs of consent to this vote, when a gentleman con demned it as needless and inconsistent after their former proceedings. The Stamp Officer then arose and declared in the strongest terms, that he would not resign till he discovered how the General Assembly were in lhat respect. 'Tis said he is gone to Hartford in order to make lhat important discovery; and that he has wrote to New York, requesting that the Stamp Paper may be detained there, 'till they are wanted here.

New Haven, January 24, 1766. Mr. Printes: Sir \u2014 As I was a party concerned in whipping the Informer, the other day, and unluckily out of town when the Court set, and finding the affair mis represented much to my disadvantage and many animadversions thereon, especially in one of your last by a very fair candid gentleman indeed as he pretends; after he had insinuated all that malice could do, adds, that he will say nothing to prejudice the minds of the people. \u2014 He is clearly seen through the Grass, but the weather is too cold for him to bite. \u2014 To satisfy the public, and in justice to myself and those con cerned, I beg you'd insert in your next, the following detail of the affair. The Informer having been a voyage with me, in which he was used with the great est humanity, on our return was paid his wages to his full satisfaction ; and informed me of his intention to leave the town that day, wished me well, and departed the town as I imagined.\u2014 -But he two days aster endeavored to make information to a Custom"], [181, "167 NEW HAVEN. House Officer; but it being holy time was desired to call on Monday, early on which day I heard of his intention, and gave him a little Chastisement; on which he lest the town; and on Wednesday returned to Mr. Beecher's, where I saw the fellow who agreed to and signed the following acknowledgment and Oath. I, Peter Boole, not having the fear of God before my Eyes, but being instigated by the Devil, did on the 24th instant, make information, or endeavor to do the same to one of the Custom House Officers for the Port of New Haven, against Benedict' Ar nold, for importing contraband goods, do hereby acknowledge I justly deserve a Halter for my malicious and cruel intentions. I do now solemnly swear I will never hereafter make information, directly or indi rectly, or cause the same to be done against any person or persons, whatever, for im porting Contraband or any other goods into this Colony, or any Port of America ; and that I will immediately leave New Haven and never enter the same again. So help me God. New Haven, 29th January, 1766. This was done precisely at 7 o'clock, on which I engaged not to inform the sailors of his being in town, provided he would leave it immediately according to our agree ment. Near sour hours after I heard a noise in the street and a person informed me the sailors were at Mr. Beecher's. On enquiry, I found the fellow had not lest the town. I then made one of the party and took him to the Whipping-Post, where he re ceived near forty lashes wilh a small cord, and was conducted out of town ; siDce which on his return, the affair was submitted to Col. David Wooster and Mr. Enos Allen, (Gentlemen ot\" reputed good judgment and understanding,) who were of opin ion that the fellow was not whipped too much, and gave him 50s. damages only. Query. \u2014 Is it good policy; or would so great a number of People, in any trading town on the Continent, (New Haven excepted,) vindicate, protect and caress an in former \u2014 a character particularly at this alarming time so justly odious to the Public ? Every such information tends to suppress our trade, so advantageous to the Colony, and to almost every individual both here and in Great Britain, and which is nearly ruined by the late detestable stamp and other oppressive acts \u2014 acts which we have so severely felt, and so loadly complained of, and so earnestly remonstrated against that one would imagine every sensible man would strive to encourage trade and discoun tenance such useless, such infamous Informers. I am Sir, Your humble servant, Benedict Arnold. New Haven, May 23, 1766. \"Last Monday morning early, an express arrived here with the charming news; soon aster which many osthe Inhabitants were awakened with the noise of small-arms from the different quarters of the town ; all the Bells were rung; and cannon roared the glad tidings. In the afternoon the Clergy publickly returned thanks for the bless ing and a company of Militia were collected under the principal direction of Colonel Wooster. In the evening were Illumination, Bonfire and dances \u2014 all without any remarkable indecency or disorder. The arrival of the regular Post from Boston last night, has completed our joy for the wise and interesting repeal of the stamp act. \u2014 Bu siness will soon be transacted as usual in this loyal Colony. \u2014 In short, every thing in nature seems to wear a more cheerful aspect than usual \u2014 to a great majority.\" The news of the battle of Lexington arrived at New Haven about noon, and Capt. Benedict Arnold,* afterwards General Arnold, who was at the time commander of the Governor's Guards, immediately called out his company, and proposed their starting for Lexington, to join the American army as volunteers ; about forty of them consented to accompany their commander. Being in want of ammunition, Arnold requested the town authorities to furnish the company, which they refused to do. The next day, immediately before they started, Arnold marched his company to the house where the select men were sitting, and after forming them in front osthe building, sent in word that if the keys osthe powder house were not delivered up to him in five minutes, he would order the company to break it open and furnish themselves. This threat had the desired effect, and the keys were delivered up. * Arnold lived in Water street, near the Ship- Yard. His house is still standing."], [182, "168 NEW HAVEN. They stopped at Wethersfield the second night, where the inhabitants vied with each other in their attentions to them. They took the middle road, through Pomfret, at which place they were joined by General Putnam. On the Guards' arrival at Cambridge, they took up their quarters at a splendid mansion, owned by Lieut. Governor Oliver, who was obliged to flee on account of his attachment to the British cause. This company was the only one on the ground that was complete in their uniform and equipments, and, owing to their soldier-like appear ance, were appointed to deliver the body of a British officer, who had been taken prisoner by the Americans, and had died in consequence of wounds received at the battle of Lexington. Upon this occasion, one of the British officers appointed to receive the body from the Guards, expressed his surprise at seeing an American company appear so well in every respect, observing that in their military movements and equip ments, \" they were not excelled by any of his Majesty's troops.\" Whilst at Cambridge, Arnold was sent by Gen. Washington, with 1000 men, with orders to penetrate into Canada, which, after encoun tering immense obstacles, was finally accomplished. About a dozen of the Guards accompanied him in this expedition. The remainder, after remaining nearly three weeks at Cambridge, returned to New Haven. During the Revolutionary war, while the enemy held possession of New York, the towns on the sea-board were continually liable to their incursions. In the campaign of 1779, the British seemed to have aimed at little more than to plunder, distress, and consume. The attack on this town took place on Monday, July 5tb, 1779, the day on which the citizens were to assemble for the purpose of commemorating the Declaration of Independence. The following account of this event is taken from the Connecticut Journal, published in New Haven, July 7th, 1779. New Haven, July 1th. About two o' clock on the morning of the 5th instant, a fleet consist ing of the Camilla and Scorpion men of war, with tenders, transports, &c. to the number of 48, commanded by Commodore Sir George Col lier, anchored off West Haven. They had on board about 3000 land forces, commanded by Major Gen. Tryon ; about 1500 of whom, under Brigadier Gen. Garth, landed about sun-rise on West Haven point. The town being alarmed, all the preparation which the confusion and. distress of the inhabitants, and a necessary care of their families would permit, was made for resistance. The West bridge, on Milford road, was taken up, several field pieces were carried thither and some slight works thrown up for the defense of that pass. The division under Gen. Garth being landed, immediately began their march towards the town. The first opposition was made by about 25 of the inhabitants to an advanced party of the enemy of two companies of light infantry. These, though advancing on the height of Milford hill, were attacked with great spirit by the handful of our people, driven back almost to West Haven, and one of them was taken prisoner. The enemy then advanced in their main body, with strong flanking parties, and two field pieces : and finding a smart fire kept up from our field pieces at the"], [183, "169 NEW HAVEN. bridge aforesaid, chose not to force an entrance to the town by that, the usual road, but to make a circuitous march of nine miles, in order to enter by the Derby road. In this march our small party on Milford hill, now increased to perhaps 150, promiscuously collected from several companies of the militia, had a small encounter with the enemy's left flank, near the Milford road, in which was killed their adjutant Camp bell,* the loss of whom they lamented with much apparent sensibility. Our people on the hill, being obliged by superior numbers to give way, kept up a continual fire on the enemy, and galled them much, through all their inarch to Thomson's bridge on the Derby road. In the mean time, those who were posted at the West bridge, perceiving the move ments of the enemy, and also that another large body of them bad landed at the South End, on the east side of the Harbor, quitted the bridge and marched thence to oppose the enemy at Thomson's bridge. But by the time they had reached the banks of the river, the enemy were in possession of the bridge, and the places at which the river is here fordable ; yet having received a small accession of strength by the coming in of the militia, they gave the enemy a smart fire from two field pieces and small arms, which continued with little abatement, till the enemy were in possession of the town. Our people being obliged to retreat, either to the fields north and west of the town, or through the town across the Neck bridge, the enemy entered the town between 12 and 1 o'clock. In the mean time, the division of the enemy, before mentioned to have landed at South End, which was under the imme diate command of Gen. Tryon, was bravely resisted by a small party of men, with one field piece, who, besides other execution, killed an officer of the enemy, in one of their boats at their landing. This di vision marched up by land, and attacked the sort at Black Rock ; at the same time their shipping drew up and attacked it from ihe harbor. The fort bad only 19 men, and 3 pieces of artillery, yet was defended as long as reason or valor dictated, and then the men made good their retreat. The town being now in full possession of the enemy, it was, not withstanding the subjoined proclamation, delivered up, except a few instances of protection, to promiscuous plunder: in which, besides rob bing the inhabitants of their watches, money, plate, buckles, clothing, bedding and provisions, they broke and destroyed their household furniture to a very great amount. Some families lost every thing their houses contained : many have now neither food nor clothes to shift. A body of militia sufficient to penetrate the town, could not be col lected that evening: we were obliged therefore to content ourselves with giving the enemy every annoyance in our power, which was done with great spirit for most of the afternoon at and about the Hitch corner. * His grave is still to be seen on the summit of the high ground on the Milford road, near the interesction of the Orange or West Haven road. Aster he was shot, he was carried into a small house then standing in the vicinity. He was attended by his servant till he expired. -22"], [184, "170 NEW HAVEN. Early on Tuesday morning, the enemy unexpectedly, and with the utmost stillness and dispatch, called in their guards and retreated to their boats, carrying with them a number of the inhabitants captive, most, if not all of whom, were taken without arms, and a few who chose to accompany them. Part of them went on board their fleet, and part crossed over to General Tryon at East Haven. On Tuesday afternoon the militia collected in such numbers, and crowded so close upon Gen. Tryon, that he thought best to retreat on board his fleet, and set sail to the westward. The loss of the enemy is unknown ; but for many reasons it is sup posed to be considerable, and includes some officers whom they lament besides Adjutant Campbell. Ours, by the best information we can ob tain, is 27 killed, and 19 wounded. As many of our dead upon examination appeared to have been wounded with shot, but not mor tally, and afterwards to have been killed with bayonets, this demon strated the true reason why the number of the dead exceeded that of the wounded to be, that being wounded and falling into the enemy's hands, they were afterwards killed. A further confirmation of this charge is, that we have full and direct testimony, which affirms that Gen. Garth declared to one of our militia who was wounded and taken, that \" he was sorry his men had not killed him, instead of taking him, and that he would not have his men give quarter to one militia man, taken in arms.\" Although in this expedition it must be confessed, to the credit of the Britons, that they have not done all the mischief in their power, yet, the brutal ravishment of women, the wanton and malicious destruc tion of property, the burning of the stores upon the wharf, and eight houses in East Haven ; the beating, stabbing, and insulting osthe Rev. Dr. Daggett, after he was made a prisoner, the mortally wounding of Mr. Beers, senior, in his own door, and otherwise abusing him ; the murdering the very aged and helpless Mr. English in his own house, and the beating and finally cutting out the tongue of and then killing a distracted man, are sufficient proofs that they were really Britons. They were conducted to the town by William Chandler, son of Joshua Chandler, late of this town, who with his family went off with the enemy in their retreat. The enemy carried off between thirty and forty of the inhabitants of the town, among whom was John Whiting, Esq. judge of probate, and clerk of the county court.

The following is the proclamation alluded to in the foregoing account. By Commodore Sir George Collier, commander-in-chief of his ma- jesty's ships and vessels in North America, and Major Gen. William Tryon, commanding his majesty's land forces on a separate expe- dition. Address lo the inhabitants of Connecticut. The ungenerous and wanton insurrection against the sovereignty of Great Britain, into which this colony has been deluded, by the artifices of designing men, for piivate purposes, might well justify in you, every fear which conscious guill could soim, re specting the intentions of ihe present armament. Your towns, your property, yourselves lie within the grasp of the power whose for bearance you have ungenerously construed into fear ; but whose lenity has persisted in its mild and noble efforts, even though branded with the most unworthy imputation. The existence of a single habitation on your defenseless coast, ought to be a subject of constant reproof to your ingratitude. Can the strength of your whole province cope with the force which might at any time be poured through every district in your country 1 You are conscious it cannot. Why then will you persist in a ruinous and ill judged resistance 1 We hoped that you would recover from the phrenzy which has distracted this unhappy country; and we believe the day to be near come, when the greater part of this continent will begin to blush at their delusion. You who lie so much in our power, afford that most striking monument of our mercy, and there sore ought to set the first example of returning to allegiance. Reflect on what gratitude requires of you ; if that is insufficient to move you, attend to your own interest: we offer you a refuge against the distress, which you universally acknowledge, broods with increasing and intolerable weight over all your country. Leaving you to consult wilh each other upon this invitation; we do now declare that whosoever shall be sound, and remain in peace, at his usual place of residence, shall be shielded from any insult, either to his person, or his property, excepting such as bear offices, either civil or military, under your present usurped government, of whom it will be further required, lhat they shall give proofs of their penitence and voluntary submission ; and they shall then partake of the like immunity. Those whose folly and obstinacy may slight this favorable warning, must take notice, that they are not to expect a'continuance of that lenity which their inveteracy would now render blamable.

The second division could not move until the return osthe boats, but before noon l disembarked with the 23d, the Hessian, Landgrave, King's American Regiments, and 2 pieces of cannon, on the eastern side of the harbor, and instantly began the march of three miles, to the ferry from New Haven, east, towards Branford. We took a field piece, which 'annoyed us on our landing, and possessed ourselves of the Rock Battery, of three guns, commanding the channel of the harbor, abandoned by the rebels on our approach. The armed vessels then entered and drew near the Gen. Garth got into the town, but not without opposition, loss, and fatigue, and re ported lo meat half past one, that he should begin the conflagration which he thought it merited, as soon as he had secured the bridge between us, over Neck Creek.

British Troops, were received from persons who were residents of the town at the time. When information of the enemy's landing at West Haven reached the town, and as their forces approached the place, persons of every age and sex were seen fleeing in all directions. A number of the in habitants took refuge on the East Rock, where they remained until the enemy left New Haven. Many, however, chose to remain, hoping that by staying quietly in their habitations, they should be secure from the molestations of the enemy; but a large number of the more patriotic inhabitants made instant preparations to harass the English as much as possible. Capt. James Hillhouse, with a small band of brave young men, some of whom were students of Yale College, advanced very near the royal troops, while on parade ground near the West Haven church ; and when they commenced their march, sired on the advanced guards and drove them back to the main body ; but owing to superior numbers, this little band was soon forced to retreat.

Dr. Daggett would in all probability have been murdered by the British, but for the interference of Chan dler, their guide, who was formerly his pupil at the College. Whilst in their hands, the President was asked, whether if released, he would again take up arms against them ? \u2014 to which he answered, \" I rather believe 1 shall if I get an opportunity.\" The British entered New Haven on the old Derby road, through Westville : a small body of men, under Capt. Pbineas Bradley, with two small cannon, made a stand to oppose their entrance on the top of the hill, on the east side of the Westville bridge, (formerly called Thompson's bridge,) but their ammunition sailing, they were obliged to retreat. The embankments thrown up on this occasion by the Ameri cans are still visible. The enemy then continued their course towards New Haven, and when at the west end of Chapel street, placed a large loaded field piece, and fired it off down the street. Our informant, Mr. Amos Doolittle, who was one of the party that resisted the enemy at Westville, states, that when obliged to leave there, his wife being sick, he returned to his house, which was near the College, and after throw ing his gun and equipments under the bed, awaited the coming of the enemy with anxiety. As soon as they arrived in front of his house, an English lady who resided with him stepped to the door, and addressing one of the officers, requested a guard for the bouse. The officer asked her, with an oath, who she was ; she informed him that she was an Eng lish woman and then had a son in his majesty's service ; upon which the officer addressing a Highlander, ordered him to guard the house, and not allow the least injury to be done to its inmates. It was owing to the address of this lady, that Mr. D. was not carried to New York by the enemy ; for some of the soldiers entering the house by the back door, and discovering the gun under the bed, inquired the purpose of it. The lady, with great presence of mind, answered that the law obliged every man to have a gun in his house, adding that the owner of it was as strong a friend to King George as themselves. A store near his house having been broken open by the soldiers, one of them advised Mr. D. to go and provide himself with whatever he wanted, adding that he was perfectly welcome \u2014 but not wishing to take advantage of his neighbor's distress, the offer was of course declined. It is mentioned in the preceding account, that among the killed and wounded were Mr. Beers and Capt. Gilbert. The circumstances of the death of these persons are stated to be as follows : \u2014 As the British entered the town, Capt. Parker, a British officer, over taking Capt. Gilbert, ordered him to surrender; upon which, Capt. G. turning round shot the officer and badly wounded him. He was im mediately pursued, and being wounded in the leg whilst endeavoring to escape, was soon overtaken by the enemy and immediately dispatched with their bayonets. Mr. Beers lived near the corner of York and Chapel streets: a shot was fired at the enemy near his premises; they immediately came into the house, charged him with the act, and mor tally wounded him, while he declared his innocence."], [188, "174 NEW HAVEN. After the royal troops left the town, thousands of country people and militia nocked in, without any order : soon after they entered, a report having been circulated that the British army was surrounding the place, they fled for the country, and their progress could be traced for miles by the immense clouds of dust which arose in all directions. It is said, that some of the country people were base enough to take advantage of the general confusion, and carried off goods to a large amount. The following is a copy of President Daggett's account osthe treat ment he received from the enemy, which is preserved in the Secretary of State's office at Hartford. An account of the cruelties and barbarities, which I received from the British sol- diers, after I had surrendered myself a prisoner into their hands. \u2014 It is needless to relate all the leading circumstances which threw me in their way. It may be suffi- cient just to observe, that on Monday morning the 5th inst, the town of New Haven was justly alarmed, with very threatening appearances of a speedy invasion from the Enemy. Numbers went out armed to oppose them; I among the rest, took the station assigned me upon Milford hill, but was soon directed to quit it, and retire further north, as the motions of the Enemy required. Haying gone as far as I supposed was sufficient, I turned down the hill to gain a little covert of bushes which 1 had in my eye; but to my great surprise, I saw the Enemy much nearer than I expected, their advanced guards being little more than 20 rods distant, plain open ground between us. They instantly fired upon me, which they continued till I had run a dozen rods, dis- charging not less than 15 or 20 balls at me alone ; however thro' the preserving provi- dence of God, I escaped them all unhurt, and gained the little covert at which 1 aimed, which concealed me from their1 view, while I could plainly see them thro' the weeds and bushes, advancing towards me within about 12 rods. I singled out one of them, took aim, and fired upon him ; I loaded my musket again, but determined not to dis- charge it any more, and as I saw I could not escape from them, I determined to sur- render myself a prisoner. I begged for Quarter, and that they would spare my life. They drew near to me, I think two only in number, one on my right hand, the other on my lest, the fury of insernals glowing in their faces, they called me a damned old Rebel and swore they whould kill me instantly. They demanded, what did you fire upon us for 1 I replied, because it is the exercise of war. Then one made a pass at me with his bayonet, as if he designed to thrust it thro' my body. With my hand I tossed it up from its direction and sprung in so near to him that he could not hurt me with his bayonet. I still continued pleading and begging- for my life, with the utmost importunity, using every argument in my power to mollify them, and induce them to desist from their murderous purpose. One of them gave me four gashes on my head with the edge of his Bayonet, to the skull bone, which caused a plentiful effusion of blood. The other gave me three slight pricks with the point of his bayonet on the trunk of my body, but they were no more than skin deep. But what is a thousand times worse than all that has been related, is the blows and bruises they gave me with the heavy barrels of their guns on my Bowels, by which I was knocked down once or more, and almost deprived of life ; by which bruises, I have been almost confined to my bed ever since. These scenes might take up about two minutes of time They seemed to desist a little from their desigD of murder, after which they stript me of my shoe and knee buckles, and also my stock buckle. Their avarice further led them to rob me of my Pocket handkerchief, and a little old tobacco box. They then bade me march towards the mam body, which was about twelve rods distant ; where some offi- cers soon inquired of me who I was, I gave them my name, station and Character and begged their protection, that I might not be any more abused or hurt by ihe soldiers They promised me their protection. But I was robbed of my shoes and was commit- ted to one of the most unfeeling savages that ever breathed. They then drove me with the main body, a hasty march of five miles or more. I was insulted in the most shock ing manner by the ruffian soldiers, many of which came at me with fixed bayonets and swore that they would kill me on the spot. They damned me, those that took me because they spared my life. Thus amidst a thousand insults, my infernal driver hastened me along faster than my strength would admit in the extreme heat of the day weakened as I was by my wounds and the loss of blood, which at a moderate commuta tion could not be less than one quart And when I sailed in some degree thro'taint ness, he would strike me on the back with a heavy walking staff and kick me behind"], [189, "NEW HAVEN. 175 with his soot. At length, by the supporting power of God, I arrived at the green in New Haven. But my life was almost spent, the world around me several times ap pearing as dark as midnight. I obtained leave of an officer to be carried into the wid ow Lyman's and laid upon a bed, where I lay the rest of the day and succeeding night, in such acute and excruciating pain as I never felt before.

Neio Haven, April 12th, 1775. \" We are informed from the parish of East Haven, that last week, the women of that parish, in imitation of the generous and laudable example of the societies in the town of New Haven, presentedthe Rev. Mr. Street, of said parish, with upwards of one hundred and thirty run of well spun linen yarn; which was gratefully received by the family; and the generous guests aster some refreshment, and taking a few dishes of coffee, agreeable to the plan of the Continental Congress, to which that society unanimously and fixedly adheres, dispersed with a cheersulnes that bespoke that they could be well pleased without a sip from that baneful and exotic herb,* which ought not so much as to be once more named among the friends of American liberty. I, Abraham Hickox, having by my conduct for some time past, given great offense to my countrymen, do take this pnblic occasion to acknowledge that my conduct has been such as justly to alarm the friends of this distressed and injured country, \u2014 in that I have ridiculed the doings of the Hon. Continental Congress; the Committees cho sen in consequence of their resolutions; and in not complying with their advice. I confess that I have not only treated the Continental Congress with disrespect and abuse, but I have also greatly abused the General Assembly of this Colony, in saying that they spent their money for nothing, which appears by evidence, though I don't myself recollect it, and have also tried lo ridicule the soldiers which have been raised for the defense of the Colony, by asking the question whether they intended to fight Gage with their feathers, and at Ihe same time told them that they would go to fight New England Rum, more than any thing else; and that the soldiers enlisted for no other motive, but to get the government's money, and to live a lazy life. I further have said that the full\" character of a Whig is a liar or words to that effect, and lhat Gage is an honest man, with many other reflections upon the character and doings of those, who in this day of distress, stand forth for the defense of the liberties of this country. My conduct herein I acknowledge to be imprudent and unjustifiable, and for which I am sincerely sorry, and I do promise for the suture, so far as I am able, to behave myself in such a manner as to give no offence to the community.

Wednesday evening last, a number of ladies and gentlemen, belonging to this town, collected at a place called East Farms, where they had a needless entertainment, and made themselves extremely merry with a good glass of wine; \u2014 such entertain ments and diversions can hardly be justified upon any occasion ; but at such a day as this, when every thing around us has a threatening aspect, they ought to be discoun tenanced, and every good man should use his influence to suppress them.

Last evening, a number of persons in this town, presented a very short Dialogue, with a short Farce, lo a very large number of spectators, who paid the very reasonable price of one dollar each for their seats. Considering the serious state of our public affairs, the absolute necessity of industry, and frugality among all ranks of people ; and more especially among the common tradesmen, mechanicks, &c. (who almost in variably have the vanity of aping their superiors in every fashionable extravagance,) I conceive an entertainment of this kind very improper, both on account of the ex pense, and the time taken up in preparation for attendance at the exhibition. And as the Hon. Continental Congress have strongly injoined on all the good people osthe United Slates, to abstain from all expensive diversions, such as Theatrical Entertain ments, Gaming, &c. 1 believe no good Whig, who duly considers the respect due to that venerable body, (were there no other objection,) can approve of this transaction. I am lar from supposing the persons concerned had any criminal design ; but believe they engaged without deliberating on the consequences that naturally attend a per formance of this kind, at the present day; but if the sentiments here held forth are just, I presume they will be kindly received, and any thing of this sort not attempted hereafter. The students of Yale College are hereby notified, lhat the present winter vacation is extended a fortnight from the 4th of next month.

Thursday last was observed as a day of festivity and rejoicing in this town on receipt of indubitable testimony of the most important, grand and ever memorable event\u2014 the total cessation of hostilities between Great Britain and these United btales, and the full acknowledgment of their sovereignty and independence. Accordingly the day, with ihe rising sun, was ushered in by the discharge ofthirteen cannon, paraded on the Green for that purpose, under elegant silk colors, with the Coat of Arms ol the United States most ingeniously represented thereon, which was generously contri buted upon the occasion by the ladies of the town. At 9 o'clock in the forenoon, the inhabilants met in the brick Meeting-house for divine service, where were convened a very crowded assembly : the service was opened with an anthem, then a veiy perti nent prayer, together with thanksgiving, was made by ihe Rev.

Previous to about the year 1800, that part of the public square now denominated the Upper Green was used as a public burying ground. In 1796, the honorable James Hillhouse purchased, near the northwest corner of the original town plot, a field of ten acres ; which, aided by several gentlemen, he leveled and inclosed. The field was then divi ded into parallelograms, railed and separated by alleys : the whole field, except four lots given to the several congregations and the College, and a lot destined for the reception of the poor, was distributed into family burying places ; purchased at the expense actually incurred, and secured by law from civil process. Each family burying lot is 32 feet in length and eighteen in breadth. In 1821, the monuments in the old burying ground were removed to the new. There are, however, some of the old monuments which still remain standing under the Center church, that building being erected over part of the ancient burying place. The following inscription is on a marble slab affixed on the west end osthe Center church. \" From the settlement of New Haven, 1638, to 1796, the adjoining ground was occu pied as a common place of burial. Then a new buiying ground was opened and divi ded into family lots and city squares. \u2014 In 1813 this church was placed over the monu menis of several whose names are engraved on tablets in the vestibule. In 1821 the remaining monuments were by the consent of survivors, and under the direction of the city, removed to the new ground.

Sacred to ihe memory of Joseph, eldest son osHezekiah and Mehitabel Frith osthe Island of Bermuda, a member osthe Senior class in Yale College He survived his wound but 24 hours, and left this world for abetter, on the Lord's day, October 5th, 1806, aged 16 years, 9 months and 11 days. \u2014 His virtues had gained the love of all who knew him, and his remembrance to his bereaved friends, who have experienced a loss which Time will never repair. Cropp'd like a rose, before 'tis fully blown, Or half its worth disclosed. This young man was killed, it is said, in a hunting excursion, by an ill directed discharge of a gun by one of his companions, who was hunting partridges in the bushes. It appears that the friends of young Frith had the impression that he was shot by design, and in accordance with this belief inserted something on his monument which gave this impression. His companions, seeling that this was an unjust and inju rious reflection, demolished the slab on which the offensive words were"], [197, "183 NEW HAVEN. inserted, and placed another in its room, without any inscription. This accounts for the apparently disconnected mention of a wound. The monument of Col. Humphreys stands near the southwestern part of the yard. It is composed of granite, and is about twelve feet in height. The following inscription is upon two tablets of copper, which are inserted into the sides of the pedestal. David Humphreys, LL. D.

In the field, he was the companion and aid of the great Washington, a Colonel in the army of Humphreys' Monument. his country, and commander of the Veteran Volunteers of Connecticut. He went Embassador to the courts of\" Portugal and Spain, and return ing, enriched his native land with the true golden fleece. He was a distinguished His torian and Poet; \u2014 a model and palron of Science, and of the ornamental and useful arts. Aster a full discharge of every duty, and a life well spent, he died on the 21st day of February, 1818, aged 65 years. Ashmun's Tomb. The above is a representation of the monument erected to the me mory of Jehudi Aslimun, Esq. the first Colonial Agent at Monrovia, Africa ; it is formed after the model of the tomb of Scipio, at Rome."], [198, "184 NEW HAVEN. The monuments of Mr. Whitney, (the inventor of the Cotton Gin,) and the late Dr. Nathan Smith are of the same form. The following is the inscription on Mr. Ashmun's monument. Ashmun. First Colonial Agent at Liberia, Africa. Born at Champlam N. Y. Ap. 21st, 1794. Landed in Africa, Aug. 8, 1822. Died at New Haven, Aug. 25, 1828. Erected by the Am. Colon. Soc. 1829. Mr. Ashmun arrived in New Haven about a fortnight before his death, laboring under severe bodily infirmities, brought on by his labors and exposures\" in a tropical climate, for the benefit of the African co lony. His constitution was so broken down by the hardships which he had endured, that the best medical skill could not save him from an early grave. His funeral was attended by a large concourse of citizens, the faculty and members of Yale College, a number of the neighboring clergy, and the governor of the State. His remains were carried to the Cen ter church, where an appropriate and eloquent sermon was delivered by the Rev. stir. Bacon. Just as the services commenced, an affect ing scene took place, \u2014 the mother of Mr. Ashmun, in her traveling dress, came into the congregation, supported by two persons, who con ducted her to a seat. She had just arrived from the shores of Lake Champlain, to visit her son in his last illness, whom she had not seen for twelve years. But she was too late ; she could only reach forth her aged hand and touch his coffin. Eli Whitney, the inventor osthe Cotton Gin. Of useful Science and Arts, the effi cient patron and improver. Born Dec'r 8th, 1765. Died Jan. 8th, 1825. In the social relations of life, a model of excellence. While private affection weeps at his tomb, his country honors his memory. In memory of Lueretia Pickering, wife of Samuel F. B. Morse, who died Feb. 7th, A. D. 1825, aged 25 years. She combined in her character and person a rare assem blage of excellence. Beautiful in form, features, and expression, peculiarly bland in her manners, highly cultivated in her mind, she irresistibly drew attention,~love, and respect. DigDisied without haughtiness, amiable without tameness, firm without se verity, and cheerful without levity, her uniform sweetness of temper spread a perpet ual sunshine around every circle in which she moved. \" When the ear heard her it blessed her; when the eye saw her it gave witness to her.\" In sufferings the most keen her serenity of mind never sailed her, death to her had no terror, the grave no gloom; though suddenly called from earth, eternity was no stranger to her thoughts, but a welcome theme of contemplation. Religion was the sun that illumined every varied virtue, and united all in one bow of beauty. Her's was the religion of the gospel, Jesus Christ her foundation, the author and finisher of her faith. In Him she rests in sure expectation of a glorious resurrection. Col. William Lyon, born March 6, 1748, died Oct. 12, 1830. He was the first Cashier of the first Bank established in this city. Scrupulously exact in his inter course with others, he was rigidly faithful in the discharge of every trust committed to him. Ardent in the pursuit of literature, his acquaintance with the biography, manners and customs of his native State was minute and extensive; and history, an cient and modern, especially that relating to the land of his forefathers, was to 'him peculiarly familiar: unshaken in the principles of civil liberty he abhorred tyranny in every form. \" He loved mercy and walked humbly with his God.\" In the year 1667, the Rev. Mr. Davenport of New Haven, having been invited to take charge of the first church in Boston, accepted the invitation, and next year removed to that capital. He had been about"], [199, "185 BETHANY. thirty years minister at New Haven, and was greatly esteemed and beloved by his congregation. His church were very unwilling that he should leave them, and never formally gave their consent. Owin\" to his removal, the church and congregation at New Haven were for many years unable to unite in the choice of a person to take the pasto ral charge of them. Mr. Davenport died at Boston, of an apoplexy, March 15th, 1670, in the 73d year of his age. In Sir Fernando Gorges' \" Wonder-working Providence,\" &tc. a re lation osthe planting osthe New Haven colony is given. Speaking of Mr. Davenport, it mentions the judicious and godly Mr. John Daven port, of whom the author is bold to say as solloweth : When men and Devils 'gainst Christ's flock conspire, For them prepar'd a deadly trapping net: Then Christ to make all men his work admire, Davenport, he doth thee from thy country set To sit in Synod, and his folk assist: The filthy vomit of Hels Dragon, deepe In Earth's womb drawn, blesi they this poison mist, And blest the meanes doth us from error keep. Thy grave advice and arguments of strength Did much prevail, the errorist confound. Well hast thou warr'd, Christ draws thy dayes in length, That thou in learn'd experience mays't abound: What though thou leave a city stor'd with pleasure, Spend thy prime days in heathen desert land, Thy joy's in Christ, and not in earthly treasure, Davenport rejoice, Christ's kingdome is at hand ; Didst ever deem lo see such glorious dayes 1 Though thou decrease with age and earth's content, Thou liv'sl in Christ, needs then mu<t thy joy raise; His kingdome's thine, and that ne'er be spent. BETHANY. Bethany was incorporated as a town in 1832. It was previously a parish in the town of Woodbridge, by the name of Bethany. It is up wards of five miles in length and four in breadth, bounded n. by Pros pect and Waterbury, w. by Oxford, s. by Woodbridge, and e. by Ham den. The central part osthe town is ten miles from New Haven. The inhabitants are principally fanners, and the population of the town has not perhaps varied much during the last twenty or thirty years. The township is hilly and in some parts mountainous, and some portions of the town are not calculated for cultivation, and have been suffered to re main for wood and timber, which is of an excellent quality. About 14 miles from New Haven, the main road to Waterbury pass es by Beacon mountain, a rude ridge of almost naked rock, stretching southwest ; at this place is ''\u2022 Collins' tavern,\" long known as an excel lent public house, and the \"Straitsville post office.\" About half a mile south of Mr. Collins', the road passes through a narrow defile, formed by a gap in the mountain, and is barely sufficient in width for a road and a small but sprightly brook, which winds through the narrow pas- 24"], [200, "186 BETHANY. sage. On both sides, the cliffs are lofty, particularly on the west ; on the east, at a little distance from the road, they overhang in a threaten ing manner. \u2014 \" The ridges of the Beacon mountain present fine geo logical and picturesque features, and are much more abrupt and grand than most of the mica slate regions of Connecticut.\" On the night following the 14th of March, 1780, the house of Capt. Ebenezer Dayton, then residing in this place, was broken into and rob bed by seven men, who were tories, and headed by a British officer, from Long Island. Mr. Dayton's house was situated nearly opposite where the first meeting house in Bethany was erected, about balsa mile south of the present Congregational church, and about ten miles N. w. of New Haven. The particulars of this robbery were obtained from the Rev. Mr. Dayton, son of Capt. Dayton mentioned above. Mr. Dayton, who belonged to Long Island, was, on account of his attach ment to the American cause, obliged to leave that island, and bring his effects with him to Bethany. A number of men, some of his neigh bors, were obliged to leave the island for the same cause, and brought a considerable quantity of money with them, and for a while resided in Mr. Dayton's bouse. With these facts, the robbers appear to have be come acquainted. At the time of the robbery, Mr. Dayton was absent on business at Boston, and the men who had been staying in the house, had left the day before, so that there was no one in the house but his wife, Mrs. Pbebe Dayton, three small children and two servant color ed children. About midnight, while they were all asleep, the window in the bedroom where Mrs. Dayton was sleeping, was burst in at once ; seven armed men rushed in, passed through the room, and immediately rushed into the chambers, expecting (it is supposed) to find the men who had left the day before. While they were up stairs, Mrs. Dayton went to the front part of the house, raised the window, and endeavored to alarm the neighbors. Mr. Hawley, the minister of the parish, and Dr. Hooker, the physician of the place, both lived within 20 rods dis tance, both had lights in their houses at the time, and both heard the alarm, but did not know from whence it proceeded. The robbers, hear ing Mrs. Dayton, came down, and tearing a sheet into strips, tied her hands behind her, made her sit in a chair, and placed her infant, (about six months old,) in her lap, while one of the robbers, placing the muz zle of his gun near her head, kept her in this position for about two hours, while the house was thoroughly ransacked from top to bottom. They sound about 450 pounds in gold and silver, which belonged to Mr. Dayton, besides other valuable articles ; what they could not con veniently carry off they wantonly destroyed, breaking in pieces all the crockery, furniture, fkc. The whole amount of property carried off and destroyed, including bonds, notes, fcc. amounted to five thousand pounds. The robbers left the house about 2 o'clock, and went to a place in Middlebury called Gunn-toivn, where they were secreted in a cellar by a family who were friendly to the British cause. While they were on their way to Gunn-town, they met a young man by the name of Chauncey Judd, of Waterbury, on a bridge, who had been to see"], [201, "BETHANY. 187 the young lady he afterwards married. Fearing he might discover them, they took him along with them. In the cellar kitchen where they were all secreted, there was a well. Into this well they talked of putting Mr. Judd ; but the old lady of the house begged they would not think of it, as it would spoil the water. They stayed in this house a number of days : afterwards they went to Oxford, where they were secreted for several days longer in a barn ; from thence they went to Stratford, took a whale boat, and crossed over to Long Island. The people at Derby, having received information of their passing through that place, two whale boats and crews, commanded by Capt. William Clarke and Capt. James Harvey, pursued them to the Island, and were fortunate enough to catch them all but one, just within the British lines. They were brought back, tried, condemned, and sent to Newgate; they however broke prison, and finally fled to Nova Scotia. It was customary in this, as in many others places, in ancient times, to have nicknames for many of the inhabitants. These names originated from various circumstances. The following may answer as specimens : Teachum, Hiccups, Toad-mounter, Satan's kingdom, ey-c. were names by which some osthe most respectable inhabitants of Bethany were de signated. Teachum was the schoolmaster of the place, \u2014 he derived his name from his occupation : Hiccups was the name of an Indian, \u2014 it was applied to a person of very dark complexion. Toad-mounter de rived his name from the following occurrence \u2014 this person, to show what could be done, took a piece of board and placed the central part on a stick of timber ; be then put a toad on one end, and struck the other with considerable force, with an axe or club, \u2014 the consequence was, that the toad was mounted to a considerable height ; in allusion to this feat, he ever afterwards went by the name of Toad-mounter. The person who went by the name of Satan's kingdom was a deacon and justice of the peace. This ungracious name was given in consequence of an unfortunate mistake. The minister of the place being sick, the deacon was called upon to officiate in his stead, it being the custom in those days, in the absence osthe minister, for the deacon or some other principal person to make a prayer in the pulpit and read some approved sermon. The time, place, and occasion, all probably tended to disturb that collection of thought in the mind of the deacon, which would be desirable on such occasions. Instead, therefore, of praying that Satan's kingdom might be destroyed, as he intended, he prayed that Satan's kingdom might be established. A mistake of this kind, and on such an occasion, of course could not be easily forgotten. The following account of the industry of a Bear, (copied from the Connecticut Journal of July 5th, 1766,) was taken from a man who was an active and eye witness to part of the scene, which happened at Bethany, about twelve miles from this town, [New Haven.] He says that on the morning of the 8lh of April (176G) last, his brother missed a three weeks old calf, which was housed the night before, in a small building. It ap peared that the Bear tried to get under the sill of the door by removing two or three"], [202, "188 B E AN FOED. bushels of dirt, but some stone hindered his passage that way ; upon 'h's raent, he changed his measures, and worked against the door with so mucn . t rengin that he drew six tenpenny nails out of the wooden hinges and ketch of the WM. us supposed he did this bv putting his paws under the door and prying and P^hing, by which means he go. in and carried off the best of two calves, a g real part \u25a0 o 1 *b ch was found in a slamp about hall a mile from ihe house. 'Twas o^rved thdt the track ol the Bear was plain, but no appearance of bis dragg mg the ca 1 alon\u201e the ground, so lhat he must have carried it on his back While peop le weie looking lor she calf, a favorite old dog, called Beaver, suddenly lest his master \"^ soon \"ller re tired wounded, supposed in an engagement with the Bear. On a rno'mng about a fortnight afterwards, the Bear was discovered eating a lamb about . m i le and a halt from the other place. Alter he was scared from thence by d\"^rh\u00b0^Ahim,M said that he was three times driven from a slock of sheep about four mi es Irom the i last place. He then destroyed a hive of bees at another place. Aboul 'oiir da,, after This performance he returned to the dwelling house near which he seized the call, ond at night unnailed ihe wooden bars which defended the window of a milk roora , got in and fea-ted on a tray of milk, turned another over and spilt it, then took up a punch bowl containmg about three quarts of cream, carefully earned u through ihe window, near fifteen fee? from the house, without spilling ; and after he had drunk or lapped it, genteelly turned the bowl bottom upwards (as if he had drank a dish of lea for break fast) and left it whole. The noise occasioned by the Bear's returning out of the win dow (which to be sure must have been greater than ihe noise occasioned by getting in) disturbed the man and his wife, who got up to discover the cause. They soon found where the robber got in ; and both together putting their heads out at a window under which the bear happened to be, he rose up, like a lion rampant, and struck at them with his paws. The woman screamed, the man shuddered, got his gun and loaded it. The Bear was then mounted on the rails of a lence. The man shot, the Bear roared, and made off. The man then sent an express for his brother (the author ot this story) who soon appeared with a good gun and his young dog Drover. Alter hunting awhile, they discovered the Bear lying in a swamp. Drover (who had never before seen a Bear) made towards him with a kind of half courage, as if unwilling to be thought a coward, at the same time prudently determining to do nothing rashly. 'Twas now remarked that brave old Beaver instead of running at the Bear, attacked Drover and prevented him showing how much he dared to do. This uncommon and seemingly strange behavior of Beaver (since it allowed their actions to speak louder than words) was reasonably impuled lo a natural jealousy, lest Drover should have the honor of disabling Bruin, which Beaver seemed sensible he had done before, and therefore claimed and strove to maintain the respect due to his merit. Drover's master then shot, the Eear groaned hideously, and both dogs fell on him, who at last forced him to take shelter in a tree. There he was suffered lo remain till daylight, when another shot brought him to the ground. His carcass weighed 162 Ibs. and it appeared that six bullets had been shot through at three charges. Let it here be supposed that he was wounded once for killing the calf, once for eating the lamb, and once for destroy ing the bee-hive. For lapping the milk, overselling the rest, stealing the cream, and damaging a garden, he was worried by ihe dogs. Several punishments for different crimes, all of which the same Bear was judged guilty of, and thus suffered for. His body was quartered, and partly eaten ai Bethany, and the remainder brought lo this town as a rarity. BRANFORD. Bkanfoed was purchased by the New Haven colonists in Decem ber, 1638, a few days after they had bought New Haven, ofMomauguin, sachem of Quinnipiac. The occasion of its first settlement was owing to a division among the people at Wethersfield. The members of the church at this place removed to Connecticut without their pastor, and having no settled minister at first, fell into unhappy contentions and ani mosities. These continued for a number of years, and divided the in habitants of the town, as well as the brethren of the church. They were the means of scattering the inhabitants, and of the formation of new settlements and churches in other places. Great pains were taken"], [203, "189 BE A N F O ED. to compose their differences, but all attempts to effect this object were unsuccessful. Mr. Davenport and some osthe brethren of the church at New Haven were sent for, in order to effect a reconciliation. The advice which Mr. Davenport and his brethren gave was, that if they could not be united among themselves, it would be expedient for one of the parties to remove and commence another settlement. This ad vice was ultimately followed. In 1644, a tract of land was sold by New Haven to Mr. William Swaim and others, for the accommodation of those persons in Wethers field who wished to remove. The settlement of the town was imme diately commenced.* At the same time, Mr. Abraham Pierson, with part of his church and congregation, from Southampton, on Long Island, removed and united with the people of Wethersfield in the settlement osthe town. A regular church was soon formed, and Mr. Pierson was chosen pastor. The town was named Branford. Branford, (central part.) The above shows the appearance of the Congregational and Episco pal churches and the academy, from the west, as you pass the main road towards Guilford, 7 miles from New Haven. The Congregational church is seen on the right; the next building, with a cupola, is the academy. The Episcopal church is the building with three windows * Sept. 5, 1640. \u2014 The General Court, at New Haven, made a grant of Totokett to Mr. Samuel Eaton, brother of Gov. Eaton, upon the condition ofhisprocuringanum ber of his friends from England, to make a settlement in that tract of country. Mr. Eaton failed in fulfilling the conditions. \u2014 About three years after, the subject was acted upon Ihus: \" Tolokett,a place fit fora small plantation, betwixt New Haven and Guilford, and purchased from the Indians, was granted to Mr. Swayne and some oth ers in Wethersfield, they repaying the charges, which are belwixt \u00a312 and \u00a313, and joining in one jurisdiction with New Haven and the forenamed plantations, upon the same fundamental agreement settled in October, 1643, which they duly considering accepted.\" \u2014 N. Haven records."], [204, "190 BEANFOED. in front. These buildings stand upon a large and open area, irregular in its form and uneven on its surface. The burying ground is situated a short distance eastward osthe house seen on the extreme right. At the time osthe union osthe colony of New Haven with Connect icut, all the towns under the jurisdiction of New Haven were satisfied with the union, except Branford. Mr. Pierson and almost his whole church and congregation were so displeased, that they soon removed to Newark, in New Jersey. They carried off the records of the church and town, and after it had been settled about five and twenty years, left it almost without inhabitants. For more than twenty years from that time, there was not a church formed in the town. People from various parts of the colony gradually moved into it, and purchased lands osthe first planters, so that in about twenty years it became resettled. In 1685, it was reinvested with town privileges.* The township is bounded n. by North Branford, w. by East Haven, e. by Guilford, and s. by Long Island sound. Its average length from east to west is about 7 miles, and its breadth 4. The surface of the town is uneven, being composed of hills and valleys; the soil is strong, but cold. When quickened with manure, it yields rich crops. The inhabitants are principally farmers. There is no considerable river in the town ; the largest stream discharges itself into the harbor, which is small but convenient, admitting vessels from 40 to 60 tons. There is a cluster of small islands belonging to this town, called Thimble Isl ands, and another cluster called Indian Islands. Various kinds of salt water fish are taken plentifully in almost every month in the year. There are 8 vessels belonging to this town, manned by about fifty hands, which are engaged in taking salmon in the river Kennebeck, in the state of Maine. This business is commenced about the 1st of April, and continued till the 1st of July. The inhabitants of Branford are generally industrious, and property is very much equalized. In 1835, they had but one town pauper. About the year 1740 was a time of great attention to the subject of religion in almost every part osthe country. The religious part osthe community were mostly divided in two parties, the New Lights and the Old Lights. The New Lights were active and zealous, in the discharge of every thing which they conceived to be their religious du ty, and were in favor of Mr. Whitfield and others, itinerating through the country and stirring up the people to reform, &c. The Old Lights considered much of their zeal as wild-fire, and endeavored to suppress it. In the year 1741, when the grand council met at Guilford, the association drew up several resolutions to be laid before that council ; among which was the following : \" That, for a minister, to enter into another minister's parish, and preach, or administer the seals of the cov enant, without the consent of, or in opposition to the settled minister of the parish is disorderly, &c.\" A majority of the ministers being of the Old Light stamp, \" they expelled from the association, all the zealous Calvinistic preachers, or enthusiasts as they esteemed them, except Mr. \u2666 Dr. Trumbull."], [205, "191 BEANF0ED. Robbins of Branford, a young preacher, who had been ordained about eight or ten years.\" Him they disciplined, &c. for some time. His first offense seems to have been his preaching for the Baptists, who had established themselves in the first society of Wallingsord about 1735. Mr. John Merriman, their pastor, had requested some of the standing ministers to preach occasionally for them. There was a complaint made against Mr. Robbins for his irregular preaching, and he was required to make a confession. As he could not conscientiously acknowledge that his preaching to the Baptists was contrary to the word of God, or the Saybrook platform, he refused to make the confession they desired, although it was evident he wished to live in harmony with his brethren in the ministry. After a variety of proceedings against Mr. Robbins, he (Mr. R.) laid the case before the society meeting at Branford. The meeting was very full, and the following votes were passed. \" 1. That this society is of opinion, that what our pastor has offered to the associa tion of New Haven county, relating to his preaching to the Baptists in Wallingsord, is sufficient.\" \"2. That this society desire the Rev. Mr. Robbins to continue in the ministry among us, notwithstanding his preaching to ihe Baptists, and what the consociation of New Haven county have done thereon.\" \" 3. That we desire the Rev. consociation and association not to send any councils or committees among us, unless the society desire it.\" \"4. That a particular people have a light to choose their own minister; and as no ecclesiastical authority has right to impose one upon them without their vote and con sent, so no authority has right to censure, suspend or depose a minister regularly or dained, without the vote and consent of his people.\" \"5. That we cannot submit to the act or conclusions ofany councils respecting the ministry among us, that are made without the vote and consent of this society.\" Votes in the affirmative, 52 \u2014 in the negative, 15. At a church meeting in Branford, Nov. 4th, 1745, the church passed the following votes : \"1. That we renounce the Saybrook platform, and cannot receive it as a rule of government and discipline in the church.\" \" 2. That we declare this church to be a congregational church.\" \" 3. That we receive the scriptures osthe Old and New Testament as the only per fect rule and platform of church government and discipline.\" \" 4. That though we receive the scriptures as Ihe only perfect rule; yet as we know of no human composure lhat comes nearer to the scriptures in matters of church go vernment and discipline, than Ihe Cambridge platform ; so we approve of that for substance, and take it for our platform, agreeably to the word of God.\" \" 5. That we are not hereby straightened in our charily, but free to hold communion, not only with congregational churches, and church members that are in good standing, but with those called Presbyterian, and also with those under the Saybrook platform regimen.\" \" Voted, That in testimony of our respect to other churches, and freeness to com mune with them; we are willing lhat our Rev. pastor should exchange labors with or dained ministers in New Haven county, or invite any of them to preach with us, as opportunity presents.\" In 1746, Mr. Robbins was cited to appear before the consociation. With the citation, the articles of complaint were delivered. They are introduced here, to give some light on the nature of the religious con troversies at that period. Those which respected his doctrine were \u2014 \" 1. That he, the said Mr. Robbins, has in public taken it upon him to determine the state of infants, dying in infancy, declaring that they were as odious in the sight of God, as snakes and vipers were to us ; and left it wholly in the dark whether there were any saved or not."], [206, "192 BEANFOED. \" 2. That he had assumed to himselfthe prerogative of God, the righteous judge, in judging ihe condition osthe dead, in a funeral sermon, saying that ihey were in hell, to the great grief of mourning friends and others. \"3. That in his public preaching he had been guilty of speaking evil of dignities; declaring that the leaders or rulers of the people were opposers of the glorious work of God in the land; and comparing our civil authority to and with Darius, who cast Daniel in the lion's den. \"4. In judging and declaring those persons carnal and unconverted, that did not approve of the late religious stir that has been made in the land ; and in the improve- ment of his sermon dividing them, and calling one part, that is, the approvers, Ihe children of God, and branding the other part with the name and character ofopposers. \" 5. The said Mr. Robbins has also publicly and censoriously judged those thai did not fall in with and impute the religious stir in the land (which he calls a glonons work of God) to be the work of God's spirit, declaring such were guilty osthe unpar- donable sin. \"6. He has publicly asserted, and taught and laid down, that a man might be sin- cere in religion, and a strict observer osthe sabbath, and yet be a hypocrite. \" 7. Said Mr. Robbins has publicly reflected upon and reviled the standing ministers of this land, calling them Arminians, and comparing them with and to false prophets, putting himself in the place of Micajah.\" With respect to his Antinomian doctrines, they complained, \" 1. That he has publicly taught us, that there is no promise in all the bible that be longs to sinners: thereby frustrating the covenant of God's free grace, and the conde scension and compassion of God, and his Son, our Saviour, to poor, lost and perishing sinners. \"2. That there is no direction in all the bible how men should come to Christ, nor could he direct any persons how they should come to him : thereby rendering the study and search of the holy scriptures, at least an unsafe and insufficient way of finding Christ and the preaching thereof useless. \" 3. He has publicly taught that it is as easy for persons to know when they are con- verted, as it is to know noonday light from midnight darkness; making the only sure evidence of conversion to consist in inward seeling, and a sense of their love to God. \"4. He has declared in public, that believers never doubt oftheir interest in Christ, after conversion ; and if they do, it is the sign of an hypocrite; rendering sanctisica- tion no evidence of conversion or justification, and lhat believers are never in the dark. \"5. He has also taught that God could easier convert the seat a man sits on than convert a moral man ; and that the most vicious or vile person stands as fair for con- viction and conversion as the strictest moral man : thereby making holiness and obe- dience to the moral law, no way necessary to be found in men for their salvation. \"6. Mr. Robbins has taught that there are some sinners thai Christ never died for, nor did he come to save them ; thereby perverting the great doctrines of redemption in the gospel, and rendering all endeavors in men to obtain salvation, useless; Armi- nianism and blending the covenant of works and covenant of grace together.\" With relation to his enthusiasm, which they complained of as exceedingly grievous to them, these articles were charged against him : \" That bitter and censorious spirit discovered by the said Mr. Robbins, against all, even civil magistrates, as well as ministers, who do not think the commotions in the land which bear the name of religion, a glorious work of God, and the effect of the agency of the Holy Spirit, declaring all such to be guilty of the unpardonable sin. \"2. In that strange heat of spirit, under which the said Mr. Robbins has acted; dis- covered in a perpetual uneasiness, or craving to be preaching ; going into those many unscriptural night meetings, and frequent public preaching under a religious pre- tence; consorting with and improving those to preach and carry on in public, as well as in those private meetings, that have been most forward and famous for their enthu- siasm in the present day. \"3. In the spirit of pride and conceitedness, and expectation to be believed oDly upon positive and bold assertion, discovered by said Robbins; among other instances thereof, by publicly declaring, in a sermon, that the standing ministers in this land were Arminians, and calling them false prophets, while he put himself in the place of Micajah before Ahab, in 1 Kings, xxii. pronouncing these words upon it, That if the body of Ihe people were in the way to eternal life, the Lord bad not spoken by him. \"4. Mr. Robbins has publicly taught, that unconverted persons have no right to praise God.\" Wilh respect to his conduct, these articles were charged : \"1. Mr. Robbins' earnestness in promoting and improving strolling or travelling preachers; and improving those that were most disorderly, to preach and exhort in the society; more especially at one such meeting carried on at his own house by Messrs. Brainard and Buel; and another at the same place, carried on by Messrs"], [207, "CHESH1EE. 193 Wheelock and Munson; to the dishonor of religion, to the just offence of many osthe church and people, and to the desttuction of peace and gospel order, in church and society. \"2. His introducing Mr. Davenport to preach and exhort, and also his man to pray and sing, at the time when he went through the country, singing along the streets ; at tended with this aggravating circumstance, that it was on sacrament day; to the great confusion and disturbance of the church, and profaning of the sabbath in this society. \"3. His preaching in Wallingsord, in the meeting-house of Ihe anabaptists there; and that contrary to the desire of a great number of the people at Wallingsord, re questing him lhat he would not, and to the advice of neighboring ministers to the con trary.\"* These complaints were evidently got up in a spirit of exaggeration. \"Mr. Robbins,\" says Dr. Trumbull, \"was a most inoffensive gentle man; mild, peaceable and a peace maker: was uncommonly gifted in prayer: a sound and searching preacher, and greatly beloved by his people. He was popular in the neighboring towns and societies, and gradually grew in esteem among his brethren in the ministry. In the year 1755, about seven years after, he was invited to sit with the con sociation, at the ordination of Mr. Street, at East Haven ; and no ob jections were made on account of any thing which had passed in the times of his trouble. The following is copied from an inscription on one of the monuments in ihe burying ground. The Revd. Mr. Samll. Russel, Deed, ye 25th day of June, 1731, in ye 71st year ofhis age, and 44th of his Ministry. Mrs. Abagail Russel, his virtuous consort, Deed, ye 7th day of May, 1733, in ye 67 year of her age. From vulgar dust distinguish'd lies The active Heralds of the skies, Whose voice Salvation did attend, Could comfort to the meeker send, And make the stubborn hearted bend ; With Honor walch his urn around, And ne'er forget the silver sound, Till Trumpets bid the Final day, And laboring Angels rouse his clay, By Heaven dismiss'd you'll shine his crown, And bow his head with glory down. In slumber bound fast by his side, The tender part, his pious bride, Reclines her head. So round the oak the ivy twines, With faithful bands in spiral lines, Though both are dead. CHESHIRE. Cheshihe was originally a parish in the town of Wallingsord, by the name of New Cheshire. It was made a society in 1723 ; it consisted then of about thirty five families. The Rev. Samuel Hall was their first minister; he was ordained their pastor in December, 1724. A church was formed, and the first meeting house erected the same year. The number of male members in the church at its formation was eleven. In the year 1770, the number of members was about 400. The Rev. Mr. Foot was ordained colleague pastor with Mr. Hall in March, 1767. In the center of the town there is a pleasant village of 40 or 50 dwellino- houses, three churches, and an Academy. The engraving on the succeeding page shows the central part of the village ; the Congre gational church is seen on the left ; the spire of the Episcopal church is seen on the right ; the next building seen westward of this is the Meth- * Trumbull's Hist.

This place is 13 J miles from New Haven, 25 from Hartford, 9 \\ southeast from Waterbury, and one mile from Beachport, a small cluster of build ings on the New Haven and Northampton canal. South view of Cheshire, (central part.) Cheshire was incorporated as a town in 1780. It is bounded n. by Southington, w. by Waterbury and Prospect, e. by Meriden and Wal lingsord, and s. by Hamden. It is about 7 miles in length from north to south, and 4 miles in breadth. The northeast section of the town is watered by the Quinnipiac. The New Haven and Northampton canal passes through the whole length of the town. The township is pleasantly diversified by hills and valleys, and the prevailing soil is a gravelly loam, generally rich and fertile. Agriculture is the principal business of the inhabitants. In March, 1732, (a little more than eight years after the society of New Cheshire was formed,) the Small Pox \" broke out in the center of the society.\" How it came there is to this day a secret. Being an unusual disease, and many opinions about it, people went upon the Sab bath and other public days, to see the sick. After some time, when it began to spread, some were afraid it was the small pox, and sent for those who had had \"the distemper, to know whether it was the small pox,\" who \"all agreed it was not; which made people careless, till Dr. Harpin came and told 'em it was. Thus the infection was spread in many families, and they were brought into the greatest distress, for want of experienced nurses \u2014 yea, had scarcely help to bury the dead.\" It appears from the Rev. Mr. Hall's discourse on the occasion, that 124 persons, probably about one third of the whole population in the society, had the disorder, and it is somewhat remarkable, considering the circumstances, that but seventeen persons died."], [209, "195 r II F.

It is a substantial brick edifice, 54 feet by 34, and was erected by the town in 1796 ; it is surrounded by a spacious court yard, and stands a little back from the main street.* This institution was incorporated in 180J, and was called the Episcopal Academy of Connecticut. Cheshire, April 29, 1796. Yesterday was laid the first stone of the Episcopal Academy, (now buildiDg in this town,) by the master of Temple Lodge, assisted by the Brethren \u2014 under the stone was laid a slate, with the following inscription : April 28, 1796. The Corner Slone osthe Episcopal Academy, erected by proprietors, was laid by the Fraternity of free and accepted Masons. The day being fine, a procession was formed from the lodge room to the Episcopal church, where a well adapted discourse was delivered by the Rev. Mr. Ives \u2014 from thence to the ground, and after laying the stone, the Rev. Mr. Brunson addressed the brethren and crowd of spectators assembled on the occasion, with a few pertinent ob servations. The procession then returned, and together with the proprietors of the building partook of a festive entertainment. The whole was conducted with order and regularity to the satisfaction of all present. Extract from Cheshire Town Records June 26th, 1780. \u2014 At a special town meeting held at Cheshire, major Reuben At water was chosen moderator. Voted, that the selectmen shall see that the soldiers which are drafted and to march to-morrow morning, be provided each man with a horse. Voted, that Miles Hull, Nathaniel Bunnell, Robert Martin and David Hitch cock, be a committee for hiring the soldiers to fill up the continental army for the term of three years, or during the present war. Voted, that the town would give to each soldier which shall enlist into the conti nental army for three years, or during the present war, to be paid equivalent to silver at 65. 8d. per ounce, the sum of twenty shillings per month, during the time of iheir continuance in the service, to be paid annually. * Since the above drawing was taken, the poplars seen standing around the Acad emy have been cut off, and the building has been somewhat improved in its general appearance."], [210, "196 DERBY Voted, that any that enlist as before mentioned, and in want of bounty money, the selectmen shall hire money for that purpose. , \u201e . .; j j_ -jl June 27, 1781\u2014 Voted, to lay a tax of two pence on the list of 1 /80, to be paid in sil ver or grain, at market price, for the purpose of raising men into the army. 1781, Dec. 11th\u2014 Voted, that Asa Brunson, Munson Mernarn and John Hrjan, De a committee lo supply the soldiers' families the year ensuing. . . 1784, March 30.\u2014 Voted, in said meeting, that they would prefer a memor lal t o me General Assembly of ihis Slate for the purpose of making the town of Cheshire a nan shire county town.

A friend to God, a guide in Christ, Do here repose their peaceful dust, To rest in darkness in the tomb, Till Gabriel's trumpet wake the just. Here lies the body of Capt. Elnathan Beach, a gentleman who from a small fortune, by an honest industry and diligent application to business, raised a very considerable estate. His liberal benefactions to the Parish osCheshire will perpetuate his name: And as he was perhaps the first in Connecticut, who began a fund for the relief of the poor, so he deserves a particular place in Ihe memory of all who wish well to mankind. He departed this life, Aug. 16th, 1742, in ye 45lh year of his age. Here lies the body of Capt. Samuel Cooke, who died Nov. 7th, 1745, in his 51st year. His indefatigable industry and success in business were equally admirable: his views of trade were large, and as his estate was sufficient for the purpose, so he generously designed to deliver his country from the slavery it had been so long in to the neighboring colonies, by opening a new scene of commerce with Europe. His de sign herein, as also his benefactions lo the church, and poor of the parish osCheshire, are worthy the imitation of all whom Providence has so remarkably blessed. DERBY. The original name'of this town was Paugasset. It appears, that about the year 1653, Gov. Goodyear, and others in New Haven, made a pur chase of a considerable tract at this place. In 1654, it seems some few settlements were made. The next year the planters presented a peti tion to the General Court of New Haven, to be made into a distinct town. The Court granted their petition, and gave them liberty to pur chase lands sufficient for a township. The Milford people, however, at the next Court made such strong remonstrances against the act, that the Court determined that the people at Paugasset should continue as they had been, under the town of Milford, unless the parties should come to an agreement, respecting the incorporation of the inhabitants there into a distinct township. In 1657 and 1659, a purchase was made osthe lands, of the chief sagamores, Wetanamow and Raskenute. This purchase appears to have been confirmed afterwards by Okenuck, the chief sachem. Some of the first planters were Ed. Wooster, Ed. Riggs, Richard Baldwin, Samuel Hopkins, Thomas Langdon, and Francis French. In October, 1675, the planters renewed their appli cation for town privileges. They represented that they then consisted"], [211, "D E EB Y 197 os twelve families, and that eleven more were about movino- into the plantation ; they had procured a minister, built him a house, and made provision for the support osthe ministry. Upon these representations, the Assembly made them into a town, by the name of Derby. Derby is bounded north by Oxford, southwest by the Housatonic, separating it from Huntington, on the east by Woodbridge, and south by Orange. Its mean length is about 5\u00a3 miles, and its mean breadth 4J miles. The face of the town is diversified with hills and valleys, and with some fine tracts of alluvial upon the borders of the Housatonic and Naugatuc. There are two societies or parishes, Derby proper, and the parish of Great Hill, in the northern section of the town. There are six houses of worship in the town, 3 Congregational, 2 Episcopal, and 2 for Methodists. Southeast view of Derby Landing. The above engraving shows the appearance of the village at Derby Landing, or Narrows, (as it is sometimes called,) as you enter it on the New Haven road, descending the hill, looking towards the northwest. The village is on the east side osthe Housatonic, immediately below its junction with the Naugatuc or Waterbury river. It consists of about 50 dwelling houses, 4 or 5 mercantile stores, and a number of mechanics' shops. These buildings are mostly built on three short streets running parallel with the river, and on the side of a high hill, which from its summit descends with considerable abruptness to the water, and of course the easternmost street is considerably elevated above the others. There are two churches in Derby proper ; 1 for Congregationalists and one for Episcopalians ; both situated about a mile north osthe Landing. On the left of the engraving, in the distance, is seen the Leavenworth bridge, leading to Huntington, crossing the Housatonic river. The present bridge was erected in 1831, at an expense of about 12 or 14,000 dollars. Part of Birmingham is seen in the distance, situated on"], [212, "198 D EEB Y the elevated point of land between the Naugatuc and Housatonic rivers. There are two packets which ply weekly between this place and New York. Considerable quantities of wood land ship timber are exported, and ship building, to some extent, is carried on at the Landing. Derby Landing is about 14 or 15 miles from the mouth of the river, where it empties into Long Island sound, and 8\u00a3 miles northwest from New Haven. The river is navigable to the Landing, for vessels of about 80 tons, there being about 10 feet of water. Southeastern view of Birmingham, Derby, (1836.) The first settlers at the Landing were Thomas Parsons, Samuel Plumb, Joseph Hull, Ebenezer Chatfield, Ebenezer Johnson, and two families of Weeds. Thomas Parsons' house stood on the ground where the Episcopal church now stands ; Plumb located himself about half a mile north ; Joseph Hull, the great grandfather of Commodore Hull, had his house about half a mile north of Plumb ; Chatfield settled a little north of Hull ; Johnson built his house about a mile s. e. of the Landing ; he was a captain, afterwards a colonel. The Weeds located themselves about a mile n. e. of- the Landing, at a place since called Squabble hole. This place is said to have derived its name from the circum stance of the two first families who lived here having much contention with each other. Capt. Ethel Keeney, now living, was the first white child born at the Landing. He was born March 17th, 1755. The engraving above shows the appearance of Birmingham, from the shore at Derby Landing. This village was commenced in 1834. There are at present, (July 1st, 1836,) about 20 dwelling houses, and 3 mercantile stores : there is in, and about to be put in operation, 1 factory for making sheet copper and copper wire ; 1 for making augers ; 1 for making carriage springs and axles ; 1 for making nails or tacks ; 1 for flannels and satinets, with some other minor manufacturing es tablishments. The water by which the mills and factories are put in operation is taken from the Naugatuc, by a canal which extends upwards"], [213, "199 D EEB Y os a mile and a half northward of the village. A steamboat is about to commence running between this place and New York. Part of the Leavenworth bridge, over the Housatonic, is seen on the extreme left. The house of Sheldon Smith, Esq. is seen a little eastward of this, on the elevated ground above the copper factory. This edifice is elegantly situated, and commands a most beautiful and interesting prospect to the southward, particularly of the village at the Landing, and the pas sage of the Housatonic through what is called the Narrows. A small round structure is seen on the right : this is the Reservoir, from which water is supplied to the inhabitants osthe village. It is raised fifty feet, from a well under the grist mill, on the canal below. The village of Humphreysville, about four and a half miles north of Derby Landing, owes its rise and name to the Hon. David Humphreys. The original name of this place was Nau-ko-tunk, which signifies in the Indian language one large tree, so named from a large tree which for merly stood near Rock Rimmon, about three fourths of a mile north of the falls. Naugatuc, the English pronunciation of the above word, was the name given to the stream passing through the village. For a long period after the settlement of this place, it was called Chuse-lown, so named from Chuse, the last sachem of the Derby Indians, who is said to have derived this name from his manner of pronouncing the word \"choose.\" His proper name was Joe Mau-ive-hu : he was the son of Gideon Mauwehu, a Pequot Indian, who was the king or sachem osthe Scatacook tribe of Indians in Kent. It appears that Gideon, previous to his collecting the Indians at Kent, lived in the vicinity of Derby, and wishing to have his son brought up among the white people, sent Joe to Mr. Agar Tomlinson of Derby, with whom he lived during his minority. Chuse preferring to live at Derby, his father gave him a tract of land at the falls, called the Indian field. Here he erected his wigwam, about six or eight rods north of where the cotton factory now stands, on the south border of the flat. It was beautifully situated, among the white oak trees, and faced the south. He married an Indian woman of the East Haven tribe. At the time Chuse removed here, there were but one or two white families in the place, who had settled on Indian hill, the height of land east of the river, and southeast of the cotton factory, in the vicinity of the Methodist and Congregational churches. These settlers wishing Chuse for a neighbor, persuaded him to remove to the place where the house of the late Mrs. Phebe Stiles now stands, a few rods north of the Congregational church. When Mr. Whitimore built on the spot, Chuse removed back again to the falls, where a considerable number of the Indians collected, and built their wigwams in a row, a few rods east of the factory, on the top of the bank, extending to Indian hill. Near the river, in the Indian field, was a large Indian burying ground ; each grave was covered with a small heap of stones. Mr. Stiles, of this place, purchased this field about forty six years since, of the Indian proprietors, and in plowing it over, destroyed these relics of antiquity. The land on the west side of the river from this place, where ihe Episcopal church stands, was formerly called Shrub oak. Both the Indians and the whites went to meeting"], [214, "200 DERBY on foot at Derby. Those of the whites who died here, were conveyed on horse litters to be buried at Derby ; these litters were made by hav- ing two long poles attached to two horses, one of which was placed before the other; the ends of the poles were fastened, one on each side osthe forward horse, and the other ends were fastened to the horse behind. A space was left between the horses, and the poles at this place were fastened together by cross pieces, and on these was placed whatever was to be carried. Chuse lived at this place forty eight years, and then removed with most of the Derby Indians to Scatacook, in Kent, where he died, at the age of about eighty years. He was a large, athletic man, and a very spry and active hunter. He had ten children.* Chuse and his family were in the habit of going down once in a year to Milford \" to salt,\" as it was termed. They usually went down in a boat from Derby Nar- rows ; when they arrived at Milford beach, they set up a tent made of the sail of their boat, and stayed about a fortnight, living upon oysters and clams. They also collected a considerable quantity of clams, which they boiled, dried them in the sun, and strung them in the same manner as we do apples which are to be dried. Clams cured by this method were formerly quite an article of traffic. The Indians in the interior used to bring down dried venison, which they exchanged with the Indians who lived on the sea coast for their dried clams. Chuse used to kill many deer while watching the wheat fields; also great numbers of wild turkies, and occasionally a bear. Some of the whites also were great hunters ; the most famous were Gideon Wash- burn and Alexander Johnson. Rattlesnakes were formerly very nu- merous about Niumph, near Rock Rimmon, and occasionally have been known to crawl into the houses in the vicinity. About the time of the first settlement at Humphreysville, a white man by the name of Noah Durand, killed an Indian named John Sunk, by mistake. They were hunting deer on opposite sides of the river \u2014 Durand on the west side, and the Indian on the east; it was in the dusk of the evening, in the warm season, at the time the deer went into the river to cool themselves. Durand perceived something moving among the bushes on the east side, and supposing it to be a deer, aimed his gun at the place and fired. Sunk, mortally wounded, immediately cried out, \" you have killed me.\" Durand sprang through the river to the assistance of the dying Indian, who begged for water; Durand took off his shoe, filled it from the river, and gave it to Sunk, who after drinking, died immediately. This took place perhaps twenty or thirty rods be- low the bridge at Humphreysville, just below where Henry Wooster lived. A kind of arbitration was afterwards held upon this case by the white people and the Indians. One of the Indian witnesses remarked, that he never knew of deer wearing red stockings before, alluding to the common Indian dress. The Indians, however, appeared satisfied that their countryman was killed by mistake, and ever afterwards made Mr. Durand's house their stopping place. * Eunice Mauwehu, aged 72 years, the youngest daughter of Chuse, is still living (1836) at Scatacook, in Kent, and it is from her that most of the particulars respect ing Chuse and the Indians are derived."], [215, "201 DERBY S. E. view of Humphreysville, in Derby. The above cut shows the appearance of Humphreysville, as it is en tered upon the New Haven road. The Humphreysville Manufacturing Company was incorporated in 1810. The village is situated in a small valley on the Naugatuc, sour and a half miles from its junction with the Housatonic river at Derby Landing. It is surrounded with lofty hills, excepting the narrow valley through which the Naugatuc passes. The heights south of the village, on the western side of the river, are lofty, rocky and precipitous. The building seen in the central part of the engraving is the Humphreysville Cotton Manufactory ; it is sour stories in height, and about 100 feet long. On the left of the print, on eleva ted ground, is seen the Episcopal church : there are two other houses of worship in this place, one for Congregationalists, and one for Meth odists ; the last two are situated on the heights a few rods s. e. from the central part of the village. Directly underneath the Episcopal church is seen, in the engraving, a part of Naugatuc river, with the falls. At this place a ledge of rocks, about twenty feet in height, crosses the river, and forms a perfect dam about two thirds the distance : the remaining third is closed by an artificial dam. This place was for merly known by the name of Rimmon Falls. There are about 50 or 60 dwelling houses in the vicinity of the factories, 3 or 4 mercantile stores, Sic. Most of the dwelling houses are south of the cotton fac tory ; only a few of them appear in the engraving. A small but beau tiful grove of pines is situated at the southern extremity of the village, through which the buildings, which are mostly painted white, appear uncommonly beautiful, as the village is approached from the south upon the river roads. \" Gen. David Humphreys was a native of this town. He was a son of the Rev. Daniel Humphreys, and was born in July, 1752. In 1767 he entered Yale College, and received his first degree in 1771. 26"], [216, "202 D E EB Y Whilst in college, he cultivated an attachment to the muses, and dis closed early evidences of poetical talent. During the Revolutionary war, he entered the army as a captain ; but at what time we are not informed. \"In 1778, however, he was aid to Gen. Putnam, with the rank of major. Two years after this, he was appointed aid to the commander in chief; having been the success ful candidate of four who solicited the office. His competitors were Col. lallmadge, Gen. William Hull, and Roger Alden. He continued in this situation during the war, having the rank of colonel, and was particularly distinguished at the memorable siege of York; and Congress as a respectable testimony of their high estimation ot his valor, fidelity, and signal services on this occasion, voted him an elegant svotA. At the close of the war, he accompanied Gen. Washington to Virginia. In 1 (84, he embarked for France, in company with the brave, but unfortunate Kosciusko; hav ing, on the appointment of Mr. Jefferson as ambassador to France, been nominated as his secretary. In 1786, he returned to America and revisited the scenes of his youth in his native town. Soon after his return, he was elected by his fellow citizens to be their representative in the legislature of the State,, and continued to be elected for two years, when he was appointed lo the command of a regiment raised for the western service. During the period that he held bis office, he remained most of the time in Hartford; and, with Hopkins, Barlow and Trumbull, assisted in the publica tion of the Anarchiad. On the reduction of his regiment, he repaired to Mount Ver non, and continued with Gen. Washington until 1790, when he received an appoint ment to the court of Portugal. In 1794, he visited America, but soon returned to Lis bon. Soon after this, he received an appointment to the court of Spain, where he continued until 1802, when he again returned to his native country. This was the end of his public life. After his return to America, he wa.s, until his death, exten sively engaged in various objects of public utility, particularly manufactures and agri culture. He is well known to have been one of the first who introduced merino sheep into this country, which has greatly improved the quality of wool, and given a strong impetus to domestic manufactures. The extensive woolen and cotton factory, which he established in this town has already been noticed. He also did much for the pro motion of agriculture; and just previous to his death was making exertions to form a society for the purpose of procuring a farm for agricultural experiments. \"Gen. Humphreys possessed considerable literary acquirements, although he pub lished no work of magnitude; bis writings consist principally of various poetical pro puctions. Of these, ihe most important are an address to the armies of the United States; a poem on the happiness of America; a poem on the suture glory of the Uni ted Slates; a poem on the industry osthe United States; a poem on the love of coun try; and a poem on the death of General Washington. He wrote also a memoir of Gen. Putnam, various political tracts, &c. He died in New Haven, 21st Feb. 1818, aged 66 years.\"* Isaac Hull is a native of this town, and was born near Derby land ing. It was to this officer that the first British flag was struck on the ocean, during the last war with Great Britain. Commodore Hull, in early life, adopted the profession of a seaman, and soon became master of a vessel. He was in this situation at the first establishment of the navy, and at that time received the appointment of a lieutenant. The first exploit which brought him into notice, was the admirable seaman ship displayed in his escape in July, 1812, when in command of the Constitution of 44 guns, from a British squadron, consisting of one ship of the line, four frigates, a brig and a schooner. The chase continued for sixty hours. On the 19th of August, 1812, Capt. Hull, with the same vessel and crew, fell in with a large frigate, which struck to him after a close action of thirty minutes. She proved to be his majesty's ship the Gurriere, rated at thirty eight guns, and carrying fifty ; com manded by Capt. J. R. Dacres. At the time the Gurriere surrendered she had not a spar standing, and her hull below and above water was * Pease and Niles's Gazetteer."], [217, "203 DE RE Y so shattered, that a few more broadsides must have carried her down. The Constitution had six killed and seven wounded. The loss of the Gurriere was 15 killed, 62 wounded, and twenty-four missing. [From the Connecticut Gazette.] Derby, Feb. 18th, 1764. On the evening of the seventh of this instant, Feb. 1764, there was a violent storm of hail and rain ; the next morning after was observed a large breach in a hill on ihe west side of the old river,* supposed to be occasioned by some subterraneous wind or fire ; the breach is about twenly feet deep, though much caved in, in length one hun dred and thirteen feet ; about sixty rods of land was covered with the gravel and sand cast out of the cavity, some of which was carried two hundred and tiny nine feet to the brink of the river; four trees of about a foot diameter were carried one hundred and seventy three feet distance, and 'tis supposed by their situation that they must have been forced up forty feet high ; some small stones about the bigness of walnuts, were carried with such velocity thai they stuck fast in a green ttee that stood near the cavity; a large dry log better than two feet diameter was carried up so far in the air, that by the force of the fall one end of it stuck so fast in the ground that it kept the other end up. The narrowest part of the breach is aboul thirty feet at the surface of the ground, and the bottom of the breach is crooking, winding much like the streaks oslightning.t The above account was taken by exact rule by us.

With holy ardor of Seraphic Love He dropt his clay and soared to Christ above. The Rev. John Bowers appears to have been the first minister in this town. He removed from Derby and settled at Rye, about the year 1688. Mr. Webb then preached at Derby about twelve years, but was not ordained. The Rev. Daniel Humphreys, the father of Gen. Hum phreys, was ordained in this place about the year 1733. The follow ing is the inscription on his monument in the old burying ground. The Revd. Daniel Humphreys died Sept. 2d, 1787, in the 81st year his age. For more than half a century he was the established minister of the first Society in this town. Mrs. Sarah Humphreys, the affectionate wife of his youth, and the tender companion of his advanced age, died July 29th, 1787, just five weeks before him.

EAST HAVEN. East Haven was originally a part of New Haven. In June, 1639, the free planters of Quinnipiac convened in Mr. Newman's barn, and formed their constitution of government. Among the subscribers to that instrument who settled in East Haven, or were concerned in that settlement, were William Edwards, Jasper Crayne, Thomas Gregson, Wm. Tuttle, Garvis Boykirn, John Potter, Matthew Moulthrop, Mat thias Hitchcock and Edward Patterson. To these were added Thomas Morris and John Thompson. After the first division of lands had been made at New Haven, several enterprising farmers began to settle on the eastern side of the Quinnipiac, when a second division was made. In 1639, Thomas Gregson petitioned for his second division at Solitary (now Morris') Cove, and on the 5th of August, 1644, 133 acres were allotted to him at that place. There he placed his family, the first in East Haven. In 1647, Mr. Gregson and a number of the principal planters of New Haven were lost at sea on a voyage to England. The first iron works in Connecticut were established in this town and continued about twenty five years. This business was introduced in the following manner. \" General Court, N. H. 12th Nov. 1655. \" The Towne was acquainted that there is a puipose, that an Iron Worke shall be set up beyond the farraes at Stoney River, which is considered will be for the publique good; and Mr. Goodyear declared thai Mr. Winstone and himself did intend to carry it on ; only he desired now to know what the Town desired in it ; much debate was about it; but no man engaged in it at present; but divers spoke that they would give some worke towards making the Damm, whose names and number of days worke were taken, which amounted to about 140 days : so it issued for that time.\" \" 29th Nov. 1655. \u2014 The Governor informed the Towne that this meeting was called to consider something further about the Iron Worke, sundry who engaged to worke last Court, have not yel performed, tho' all others have : and it was now concluded that those who are row bebinde, should be called upon to perform what they promised, It was also now desired that men would declare, who wiil engage in the worke, and what estate they will put in. But few speaking to it, it was desired that those who are willing would meet at the Governor's ibis afternoon at 2 o'clock, to declare them selves therein, and it was now propounded whether the Towne will give up their right in the place, and what accommodation is necessary for the best conveniency of the said Iron Worke ; in this case all the Towne voted to give a full libertie for the Iron Worke to go on, and also for wood, water, ironplace, oares, s'hells for lime, or what else is necessary for that worke, upon the Towne lands upon ihe side of the great river, called the East River ; provided that no man's propertie, laid out, or to be laid out, be entered upon, nor no planter prohibited, from cutting wood, or other conveniency upon the said common, in an orderly way; and that Branford doe make the like grant, according to their proportion they have in the worke, that future ques tions about this thing may be prevented. \" 19th May, 1656\u2014 Upon motion of Mr. Goodyear and John Cooper in behalf of the Collier that comes to burn coal for ihe Iron workes ; he had 12 acres of land granted him as his own, if the Iron Workes goon, and he stay three years in the worke. Provided that all minerals there be reserved, and that he attend all orders of the Towne for the present, and in disposing of said lands hereafter, if it shall so fall out, to have it. The place propounded for is a piece of land lying betwixt the Greai Pond, and the Beaver Meadows, a 100 or 2 acres, about two miles Irom the Iron worke. Against which grant or place none objected, so as to hinder the same \" Business was carried on here both from New Haven and Branford. It continued until about 1680. Why the business was relinquished cannot be now satisfactorily ascertained. The tradition is, that it was"], [219, "205 east haven. occasioned by the death of the principal workmen, during a season of great mortality in 1679. The furnace was supplied with bog ore from North Haven. It was chiefly carted, but sometimes brought from Bog mine wharf by water, round to the point below the furnace ; and from that circumstance the point to this day is called Bog mine. East Haven was incorporated as a distinct town in 1785. It is bounded n. by North Haven, e. by Branford, s. by Long Island sound, and w. by the harbor and Quinnipiac river, dividing it from New Haven. It is about 6 miles long and 3 wide. Central part, 3J miles from New Haven. Agriculture and fishing constitute the principal business osthe inhabitants. Considerable mercantile business is done in Fair Haven. Congregational and Episcopal Churches, East Haven. The above is a western view of the Congregational and Episcopal churches. The Congregational church is seen on the left, the Episco pal is on the right, a small building with three windows on the west side. The Congregational church is constructed of stone, and is 70 feet by 50. The walls were raised and covered in 1773-4; the finishing of the house was suspended for several years. Public worship commenced in it in September, 1774. Considering the time this edifice was built, it is a \" great and honorable work, and stands as a lasting monument of the enterprise, public spirit, wisdom and perseverance of the inhabitants.\" The Episcopal church was erected in 1789. \" The village bore their proportion of town and colony charges, and endured great hardships and dangers, in attending public worship at New Haven. After the termination of King Philip's war, the power ful tribes that were under the influence of the French in Canada, fre quently assumed a hostile attitude. In 1689, the town prepared a flying army, which stood ready to march at a moment's warning. A patrol of sour horsemen was continually scouring the woods. And all the militia were obliged to carry their arms with them to public worship,"], [220, "206 east haven. prepared for battle. The Indians near the village were sometimes em- ployed as scouting parties, and in other respects as useful auxiliaries. The following anecdote received from the oldest man now living in the town, and received by him from his father, may be worth preserving : \" A friendly Indian warrior was requested to act as sentinel in the Gap, north of Mullen hill. He consented, and for this purpose borrowed Mr. Heminway's gun, and was assured it was well loaded. Without examination, he took the gun and repaired to his post. He soon per- ceived two enemy Indians descending into the valley from the Pond Rock, and advancing towards the Gap. They passed him, and when he had them in range, intending to kill both at one shot, he attempted to fire, but his gun only flashed, for it was not charged. The spies, without observing it, passed on across the fresh meadows, and mingled with the friendly Indians about Grave Hill. The disappointed warrior was enraged, and threatened to kill Mr. H. for deceiving him in order that he might be killed. Mr. H. was innocent of the charge ; for he had charged the gun himself, but some other person had discharged it without his knowledge, and priming, left it in the usual place in that condition. With the discovery of this fact, the warrior was finally paci- fied. But in a day or two, one of these spies was sound dead on the Indian land, \u2014 and supposed to have been killed by the enraged warrior.\" The following account osthe first settlement of Mr. Heminway, their first minister, is from the Rev. Mr. Dodd's History of East Haven. Jacob, the youngest son of Samuel Heminway, and born in the village, graduated at the college at Saybrook, under the Presidency of the Rev. Abraham Pierson, 1703, and was ihen about 20 years of age. \u2014 To him the people turned their attention. \" At a meeting of the village, 20th Nov. 1740, Voted to look out for a minister to carry on the public worship of God amongst us; it was voted \u2014 1. To seek to Sir Heminway that he would give them a taste of his gifts in order to settlement in the worke of the ministry. And\u2014 2. Voted to desire John Potter, Sen. Caleb Chedsey, and Ebenezer Chedsey, to treat with Sir Heminway, to get him, if they could, to give them a taste of his gifis in preaching the Wqrd.\" At another meeting of the Village, 19th Dec. following \u2014 \" They having bad some taste of Sir Heminway in preaching the Word, did declare their desire to have him go on in the worke of the Ministry amongst us, in order to settlement ; and towards his encouragement they engage to allow him after the rate of \u00a340 by the year in pay. And, Voted that George Pardee and Caleb Chedsey signify our desires and proposi tions to Sir Heminway, and take his answer and make returne.\" The Committee immediately consulted Mr. Heminway, and reported at the same meeting, \" That Sir Heminway does comply with their motion, God's grace assisting, and does accept the proposilion, and desire some consideration with respect to wood.\" The next month they voted to give him \u00a350 a year. They continued in this state until the close of the year 1706, when, at a meeting, the village appointed \" William Ludington and John Potter to treat with Sir Jacob Heminway, to see whether he will goe on in the work of ihe Ministry amongst us.\" And the same day reported Mr. Heminway's answer in writing. \" Gentlemen, Whereas you have given me notice by two men, that you desire me to carry on the work of the Ministry in order to settlement among you. I do, there fore, hereby give you notice that so far as God shall enable me thereunto, I am heartily ready and willing to gratify these your desires upon these conditions\u2014 1. That you give me \u00a350 yearly, and my wood. 2. That you build me a good convenient dwelling house, within 2 years time, or give me money sufficient to do the same, one half this year ensuing, and one half the next. 3 That when it is in your power, you give me a good and sufficient portion of land.

' JACOB HEMINWAY.\" On the 26th of the same month, the village met and voted, \" We do promise Mr Heminway, if he will carry on the worke of the ministry in said village, to build him a house, if we can, in two years after this date, and give him \u00a350 pay, and his wood"], [221, "207 east haven. And in the mean time, if he wants a house to hire him one.\" To accomplish these objects they laid a lax of sour-pence farthing. In the year 1707, the village built a house for Mr. Heminway, 40 feet long and 20 feet wide, on a five acre lot, on the southeast corner of the Green. One half acre was allowed to set the house upon, adjoining lo Mr. Heminway's home lot. The wages in working at the house were three shillings a day lor a man, and six for a team. The terms proposed were adjusted and ratified in 1709. They gave to him the house and lot it stood on \u2014 also twelve acres on the cove road, twelve acres in the bridge swamp, 30 acres in ihe half mile, \u00a350 per annum, and sufficient wood, \" if he performs the work osthe Ministry so long as he is able ; or if it be our fault that he is forced to leave us, it shall be his. But if it be his fault, or he leaves the place, or is hindered in the worke, then the property is to return to the village. And he is to have the use osthe Parsonage land.\" The same year, \" 3d May, 1709, voted to petition the Gene ral Assembly that we may embody into a Church state.\" \" The great burying place of the Indian tribes in this town and vici nity, is on the north end of the hill on which the Fort stands, which, anciently, in allusion to this place, was called Grave Hill. Some of the graves have been leveled by the plow, but many of them are yet visible. In the year 1822, I examined three of these graves. At the depth of about three feet and a half the sandstone appears, on which the bodies were laid, without any appearance of a wrapper or enclosure. They all lay in the direction of southwest and northeast \u2014 the head towards the west. Of two of them, the arms lay by the side ; the other had the arms across the body, after the manner osthe white peo ple. The large bones and teeth were in a sound state. The thigh bones of one measured 19 inches in length, the leg bone 18, and the arm from the elbow to the shoulder 13. By measuring the skeleton as it lay, it was concluded to be that of a man six and a half feet high. No article of any description appeared with the bones. It is said, that about fifty or sixty years ago some of these graves were opened, and a number of Indian implements, of the kitchen and of war, were found in them. Few Indians have been buried there within a century past. \" The Indians had a fort on the hill in the burying ground, and from that circumstance it was called Fort Hill. It is also a tradition, that they had another on the hill north of Daniel Hughes' house, and near the old ferry road. The appearance of shells shows that they had a village on that spot. The same indications appear in the woods of Southend Neck, west of the sluice. Great quantities of oyster shells are collected among the rocks and in the little valleys, on the banks of the river, showing the places where their weekwams stood.\"* East Haven, April 26, 1781. Early on Thursday morning last, the Guard House on the East side of our Har bor, near the Battery, was discovered to be nearly destroyed by fire, and John Howe lying dead near the House; the rest of the Guard (eleven in number) who were sta tioned there the evening before missing, supposed to be taken off by a Party from Long Island in Whale Boats, who set the building on Fire, and that Howe being on Centry, was shot dead ; but whether any others were killed or wounded, is not known, as the party who did the mischief got off\" undiscovered, and no accounts have been received of them since. * Rev. Mr. Dodd'S History of East Haven."], [222, "208 EAST HAVEN. The following incidents were related by an aged lady, who is now living in the town of East Haven. They are said to have taken place at the time of the great excitement about witchcraft. These events were related to the lady by her father, who is now dead, and was an eye-witness of these occurrences. The relation may be considered as a fair sample of Witch stories, which in ancient times were generally believed. \" The old gentleman referred to above, was riding on one bright moonlight evening in a very lonely place called the Dark Hollow, <a by-road which leads from East Haven to Fair Haven,) when he saw two females at the head of his horse, very earnestly (apparently) engaged in conversation, and keeping pace with his horse. He was con siderably excited, and his feelings of fear were aroused, as he had no doubt that these were the famous hags that were disturbing the peace of the land. He had, however, courage enough to speak lo them in these words, \u2014 \"In the name of God, I beseech you to tell me who you are.\" When wonderful to behold, they immediately vanished. He got off from his horse to look for them, but could find nothing but a riding hood, which lay where they disappeared \" A short time after this event, the same gentleman was riding, as he says, past one of his orchards, and there appeared to him to be some one shaking one of his apple trees : a considerable quantity were falling to the ground. He went up to the tree, and the ground was covered with apples which had just fallen from this tree ; but there was no one to be seen \u2014 all was still as the grave.\" \"The following is still more mysterious, \u2014 there was an old woman lhat lived not far from the neighborhood of this gentleman, who was suspected by the neighbors of being one of these tormentors of mankind. Their hogs would run about on their hind legs, and squeal as though they were possessed by legions of unclean spirits; their children would be taken sick and crying out \" that some one was sticking pins in them.\" A member of one of the families, would roll about the floor with great rapidity, as though urged forward by some invisible power ; and the members of the family had to keep an Eagle's eye on the rolling gentleman, lest he should roll into the fire. When the neighbors made their bread it was full ot hairs, and their soap would run over their kettles, and fly about the floor like burning lava, from the crater of Mt. Etna. In the night large stones would tumble down their chimneys and break their cooking utensils, setling the whole family in an uproar. It appeared as though the powers of darkness had been let loose from Pandemonium to lorment these neighbors. But not long after these difficulties all ceased in a singular manner, i. e. One of the neighbors' pigs was running about on its hind legs as described, and the man who was noticing it, jumped over into the pen and cut off one of its ears, and the old wo man mentioned, always afterwards had one of her ears muffled. The neighbors were now satisfied that this woman was the cause of all their troubles. However they thought they would say nothing or do nothing for the present, but see how these things continued; and a short time after this one osthe neighbors was makiDg potash beside the river, and it began to fly out and run about so that they could do nothing with it. They held a consultation and concluded that they would shoot inlo it with a rifle, ac cordingly Ihey did; and immediately there was a calm, and they were enabled to go on with their wTork and finish it. In the morning the neighbors went to the place where this woman resided, and they sound her dead, and thus their troubles ended.* But it appears this woman was not the only suspected witch in the place; for in an old lonely house which stood on the road leading to New Haven, lights were seen in the night; the sound of the violin, and the noise of persons dancing, was heard by the inhabitants of the place, around it, until they went to work day after day, pulling its clapboards off, umil the house was completely destroyed, to the joy of the inhabi tants of the town, and nothing more of any consequence was heard of witches from that time.\"t * A granddaughter of this old woman is now living in East Haven. She is noted for her eccentricities, her singular life, &c. t The house which stands on the east side of the Episcopal church in East Haven was built on the foundations of this house."], [223, "209 GUILFORD. GUILFORD. The Indian name for Guilford was Menunkaluc. It is an ancient town, its settlement having commenced in 1639, the year after that in New Haven. \"The principal planters were Henry Wbitfield, Robert Kitcber, William Leet, Samuel Desborough, William Chittenden, John Bishop, and John Cassinge. The lands in Milford and Guilford, as well as in New Haven, were purchased by the principal men, in trust for all the inhabitants of the respective towns. Every planter, after paying his proportional part of the expenses, arising from laying out and settling the plantation, drew a lot or lots of land, in proportion to the money or estate which he had expended in the general purchase, and to the number of heads in his family. These principal men were judges in the respective towns, composing a court, to judge between man and man, divide inheritances and punish offenses according to the written word, until a body of laws should be established. The pur chasers of Guilford agreed with the Indians, that they should move off the lands which they had purchased. According to the agreement they soon all removed from the plantation. The number of the first free planters appears to have been about forty.\"* The following extract is from a history of Guilford, by Rev. Thomas Ruggles, in the 4th vol. of the Massachusetts Historical Collections. \"It fully appears that the purchase from the natives was full, clear, and satisfactory: That the purchase was made for, and the purchasers acted in behalf of, the planters as well as themselves : That all divisions of the purchased land were made lo the res- pective planters, in an exact proportion to the sums they advanced in the purchasing and settling osthe town : And that the Indians, inhabiting the town, were to, and ac- cordingly did, remove from said land. Where they went to is no! certain : The tra- dition is, that they removed to the westward, where Branford and East Haven now are: So that there is not one of ihe original Indians belonging to the township. From Aigicomock or East river to Tuxisshoag, (a pond contiguous to East Guilford meet- ing house,) was purchased of Uncas, sachem osthe Mohegan Indians: from which it appears that the East river was the western limits of Uncas's jurisdiction. The re- maining part osthe town, to Hammonasset river, Mr. Fenwick, of Saybrook, gave to the town on this condition, that the planters should accommodate Mr. Whilfield (who was his particular friend) with land in the town, agreeable to his mind. There were some small purchases made of particular Indians, within the limits of the township, who claimed a right to particular parts. \" As soon as the purchase was completed, the planters removed from New Haven, though it was almost winter, andsetiled themselves at Guilford. How the planters conducted themselves until the year 1643, does not appear upon record; only this, the lands were left in the hands of their six purchasers, to whom the Indians gave the deed, as trustees, until a church should be gathered, into whose hands they might commit the fee of Ihe land, to be properly divided amongst the planters. And while they remained in this unsettled state, they chose four of Ihe principal planters, to whom they gave the full exercise of all civil power for administering justice, and pre- serving the peace among the planters; whose power was also to continue till the church appeared in form, when their power was to end. \" As, therefore, so much depended on this, as soon as their wilderness slate would admit, they did, in the month of April, 1643, form themselves into a congregational church into whose hands the purchasers of the land, and the persons invested with civil power, did actually, in a formal manner, in writing, resign all their rights and authority unto the church galhered on that day. Presently alter this, the planiers, who were chiefly church members, made regular divisions of all the lands, accord ing to their respective shares, agreeably to their original covenant, and according to * Dr. Trumbull. 27"], [224, "210 GUILFORD. their expenses and number in each family, (servants excepted.) But their divisions of land were under two restrictions: First, that no one should put into stock more than \u00a3500, without liberty: And, 2. That no person should sell or alien, in any manner, or purchase the share, or any part thereof, allotted lo another, without express liberty from the community. The last article was strictly observed, which proved highly beneficial to the town, by preventing persons engrossing too much land; and sundry persons who presumed to violate this agreement were punished by fines and whipping. As this plantation was connected with New Haven, the inhabitants carefully adhered to the agreement made in Mr. Newman's barn, in all their affairs, religious and civil. \" The planters, finding civil government absolutely necessary for their subsistence, established a system, as nearly as they could, conformed to the grants from the lords Say and Brook to Mr. Eaton and company. Their form of government was some thing singular. Like that at New Haven, it was a pure aristocracy, yet modeled and exercised in a peculiar way. They had one magistrate, who was Mr. Samuel Desbo row, allowed them as a past of New Haven colony, of which he was one of the assist ants and council, who was their head, and invested with the whole executive and ju dicial power. But the planters were allowed to choose, annually, three or sour depu ties to sit with him, in judging and awarding punishments in all civil causes, in courts held by him, called General Courts. The inhabitants were divided into classes, or orders, by the names of freemen and planters. The freemen consisted of all the church members who partook osthe sacrament, and no others were admitted. They were all under oath agreeably to their plan of government. Out of this number were those deputies, and all public officers, chosen ; and by them was managed all public business that was was regarded either interesting or honorable. The second class in cluded all the inhabitants of the town, who composed their town-meetings, which were styled, emphatically, General Courts. It is however required, that they should be of age, (twenty one years,) and have a certain estate, to qualify them to act in said meetings. In these town meetings, or general courts, all divisions of land were lim ited and established, and all the bye or peculiar laws, for the well ordering the planta tion, were made And, in general, all transgressions osthe town laws, relating to Ihe buying or selling land, were punished, and fines and stripes were imposed and execu ted, according to the nature of the offense, by the judgment of the said judicial court. Besides these general assemblies of the planters, and the said magistraies' court, they appointed particular courts for the administration of justice, much like our justices' courts at present. These were held quarterly through the year. The magistrate presided in ibese courts, and deputies were annually chosen to sit in council with him, in these courts also, by the freemen. Like New Haven, they had no juries in any trial ; their deputies, in some measure, supplied that defect. From this court lay ap peals, in allowed cases, to the court of assistants at New Haven. The said Mr. Sam uel Desborow was the first magistrate who held the courts. In general, their judg ment was fiDal and decisive. Town officers were annually chosen, viz. marshals, a secretary, surveyors of highways, &c. much in the present manner. Military order and discipline were soon established, and watch and ward were kept, day and night, under a very strict charge; and the punishments for defaults, in ihis duty, were very severe and exactly executed. Many of the houses were fortified with palisadoes, set deep in the ground. And a guard of soldiers, under a proper officer, was appointed every sabbath, in time of public worship, that no enemy might surprise them, and this was continued many years. All the laws, orders, and regulations were entered at large upon ihe town lecords. \" The Rev. Mr. Henry Whitfield, who led forth this little flock into the wilderness, was their first pastor and minister. He had been episcopalty ordained in England. No mention is made on record, or by tradition, of any ordination of him here. As the members of his church came with him, and were his cure in England, gathering the church here seems to have been only matter of form, arising from place and local distance, on their removal; but he exercised his ministerial authority in the same manner, and by the same authority, he had done in England. Neither minister, church, or people, were ever dissenters or separaters from the church of England, only by local remove from the realm. The minister aud church were as truly such in Guilford as in England: All which rights, powers, and privileges remain to this day; and to depart from its communion, from any pleas of the professors of the church of England, are unreasonable, and without good foundation. Like the church in New Haven, they required a relation of experiences of members on their admission into the church. \" Mr. Whitfield, their pastor, was a well bred gentleman, a good scholar a great divine, and an excellent preacher. He was properly the father of the plantation He loved his flock tenderly, and was extremely loved by them. He was possessed of a large estate, and by far the richest of any of the planters; all of which he laid out"], [225, "GUILFORD. 211 and spent in the plantation, for the benefit of it. At his own expense he built a large, firm, (and for those days,) handsome stone house, which served as a sort for himself and many of the inhabitants, upon the land allotted to him by the planters, in a very conspicuous and delightful place, having an extensive view of the sea in front; and, with a comparatively small expense, might now be made Ihe most durable and best house in the town : [That house has since been handsomely repaired :] A lasting me morial of his greatness and benefactions to the town. In the change of times in Eng land, under the commonwealth, he returned thither. Several of the planters returned with him ; among whom was Mr. Desborow, (who was near relation of Colonel Des borow,) Mr. Jordan, &c. It was then the general opinion that Ihe whole plantation would be deserted, as they had opportunity to transporl them and families. \"In consequence of his own expenses in purchasing the plantation, and Mr. Fen wick's gift of the eastern part of the town, Mr. Whitfield had a large and very valua ble allotment of some of the best lands in the township allotted to him. \" Upon his return to England, lie offered all his estate to the planters upon very low terms; but partly from poverty, but chiefly from a persuasion that they should all sol low him, they did nol make the purchase ; but when it was too late, they repented their refusal. Alter his return home, he sold his estate to major Thompson, to whose heirs it descended. No meDtion is made on record of the lime of Mr. Whitfield's removal ; the tradition is, that he lived in the plantation about twelve years. When he lei t lliem, he left Mr. John Higginson, his son-in-law, their teacher. He was son lo Mr. Hig ginson, first pastor of Salem church. He preached first at Saybrook sort, as chaplain, about the year 1613; after which he removed to Guilford, was one of the seven pil lars, and assisted Mr. Whitfield in preaching until his removal. He was never or dained in Guilford; but Mr. Whitfield left him to take care of the flock, as their teacher. In this work he continued about twelve years, and then determined to go to England. After Mr. Higginson's removal, the town was in a very unsettled state for about twenty years. There were several who ministered to them, particularly Mr. Bowers, who had a house and land in the town, but afterwards removed to New Haven and Derby. In this headless slate of the church, they fell into great confusion, by diversity of opinions; many removed to Killingworth, (about ten miles east,) which was then settling; some of them returned afterwards, of whom was Doctor Rosseter. After they had waded through those troublesome times, about the year Mr. Jo seph Elliott, son of the famous and pious Mr. John Elliott, of Roxbury, the Indian New England apostle, was ordained over the church here. After he had preached about thirty years he died, May 24, 1694. Some time after, in the summer of this year, Mr. Thomas Ruggles, of Roxbury, came and preached as a candidate ; and in the fall of the year 1695 was ordained pastor of the church, under whose ministry the church enjoyed great peace, and religion flourished, though the seeds of division were then sowed. He deceased June 1, 1728. His eldest son, Thomas Ruggles, who was the author of this manuscript, succeeded him March 26, 1729.\" The following is a west view of the old Stone House in Guilford, which is believed to be the oldest house now standing in the U. States. This building was erected by the company who first settled the town, about the year 1640. The leader or head osthe company was Henry Whitfield, a minister osthe church of England, and one of the number of those who were called Non-Conformists. This house was built for him. The stone of which the building is constructed was brought on hand-barrows, from a ledge some considerable distance from the place where the house stands. The cement used in building the walls is said now to be harder than the stone itself. The walls were plastered 15 or 20 years since. Mr. Whitfield, and several others of the company who came to this place in 1639, returned to England in 1649. This house was used by the first settlers as a kind of sort for some time, to defend themselves against the hostile savages. The first marriage which took place in this town was solemnized in this building. The supper which was provided for the occasion consisted of pork and pease.* \u2666 MSS. from Guilford. This house is now occupied, and in good repair."], [226, "212 GUILFORD. Ancient House at Guilford, Conn. Guilford is 16 miles east of New Haven, and 36 south from Hart ford ; bounded n. by Durham, w. by Branford, e. by Madison, and s. by Long Island sound. Its length from north to south is about eleven miles, and its breadth averages about sour. The township is divided into two parishes or societies, Guilford and North Guilford. In the first society is the borough of Guilford. which was incorporated in 1815; it is handsomely situated upon a tract of alluvial or maritime plain, about two miles back from the sen, and near a small stream, called the Me nunkatuc. Its limits embrace the ancient town plot, which is laid out with considerable regularity. In the center there is an extensive open public square. The borough is compactly built, consisting of about 150 dwelling houses, 2 churches, 1 Congregational and 1 Episcopal, and a town house. Many of the houses are ancient in their appearance, and the people have retained, more than most others in the State, the an cient manners of the New England colonists. The following is a view of the Congregational church, situated on the north side osthe public square. The first building north osthe church is the academy, the next is the town house ; the last two buildings formerly stood on the square. About sixty rods west osthe church, the cellar in which Goffe and Whalley were secreted for a time, is still to be seen ; Governor Leete's store formerly stood over it. The tradition is that they remained in ibis cellar three days and nights. \"A daugh ter of Governor Leete afterwards married in New Haven to Mr. Trow brid^e. It is an anecdote still preserved in that family, that she often used to say that when she was a little girl these good men lay concealed under her father's store, but that she did not know of it till afterwards: that she well remembered, that at the time of it, she and the rest osthe children were strictly prohibited from going near that store for several days, and that they wondered at it, and could not conceive the reason"], [227, "GUILFORD. 213 os it at the time, though they knew it afterwards. Tradition says that they were however constantly supplied with victuals from the gover nor's table, sent to them by the maid, who long after was wont to\u00b0glory in it, that she had fed those heavenly men.\" Congregational Church at Guilford. Guilford is a place of considerable resort during the warm season of the year, for the benefit of the sea air, &c. There are two establish ments for this purpose ; one about a mile and a half below the Congre gational church ; the other at Sachem's Head, about three and a half miles to the southwest. Both these places are accessible to steamboats. The scenery in the vicinity of Sachem's Head is wild and picturesque. Agriculture is the principal business of the inhabitants. The following is from Ruggles' MS. history of Guilford, in the 10th vol. of the Massachusetts Historical Collections. \" So early as 1643, a Congregational church was gathered, or rather they then com bined into a visible church state. They adopted Mr. Davenport's notions ; and formed the church by covenant upon seven pillars, as they termed it. The names of the seven pillars were Mr. Henry Whitfield, Mr. William Leete, Mr. John Mipham, and \" John Higginson, \" Jacob Sheese, \" John Hoadly ; \" Samuel Desborow, and on ihe nineteenth day of the month of Apiil (probably the very day the church was thus settled) the records say, ihe feoffees in trust formally in writing resigned the land purchased by them to the church, &c. \" The manner'of gathering or forming the church was this, viz. a doctrine of faith was drawn up and assented to as the foundation of their connexion. And then they mutually entered into covenant, first with God to be his people in Jesus Christ ; then one with another, to walk together in attending all Ihe duties osthe christian religion, and enjoyment of all the ordinances lhat belong lo a particular visible church. Their doctrine of faith was judiciously drawn. It is short, comprehensive, and rational, upon true primitive, Calvinistical, and Congregational principles. This doctrine of faith with ihe covenant is continued and made use of constantly in admitting church members to this day by the first church.\" * * * * Mr. Higginson conlinued in the ministry at Guilford about twelve years, \"and then determined to go to England to Mr. Whitfield. Accordingly he shipped himself and family, and sailed. But meeting with bad weather, the vessel put into Salem for harbor. Going ashore to his father's people, they wanting a pastor, prevailed with him to preach, and then unship his family and goods, and settle with them. He accepted their call; was ordained their pastor; and left a numerous pos-"], [228, "214 GUILFORD. terity, which have been in renown in their several generations. This is the account he gives of himself in a book of sermons printed by him in his old age, and dedicated by him to the church and people of God at Salem, Guilford and Saybrook, where he preached at first in the time of the Pequod war.\" \u201e \" After Mr. Higginson's removal, \" while they had no ordained pastor, and tell into great confusion by diversity of religious opinions, many of the planters removed, especially to Killingworth, which was then settling, particularly Dr. Rosseter, Meigs, the Stevens family, and Chatfield, &c. who were useful in that town, and continue to be respectable in church and state there. Some of these returned, especially Rosseter and Meigs, after the town was restored to a peaceable settlement of a pastor.\" \"After they had waded through these troublesome times, providence provided for them a pastor after God's own heart, to feed them with knowledge and understanding. For about the year 1664 or 1665, the renowned Mr. Joseph Eliot, son of the famous and pious Mr. John Eliot of Roxbury, (the Indian New England apostle) was called and introduced, and by the laying on of the hands of the presbytery, was ordained to the pastoral office in ihe church. Mr. Mather of Northampton, with whom Mr. Eliot had lived some time before be came to Guilford, being the chief in the ordination. The church and town greatly flourished under his successful ministry. \"After this burning and shining light had ministered to this good people about thirty years, he deceased May 24, 1694, to the inexpressible grief of his beloved flock, whose memory is not forgotten to this day. Some time in the summer of this year, the Rev. and pious Mr. Thomas Ruggles, likewise from Roxbury, was persuaded to come and preach to them as a candidate for the ministry, and in ihe fall of the year, 1695, was ordained pastor of this church, by the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.\" * * * \" After he had faithfully fed the flock, he deceased June 1, 1728, in the thirty fourth year of his ministry, and fifty-eigth year of his age.\" \" His eldest son, Thomas Ruggles,* was called to succeed him, and was ordained by the laying on osthe hands of the presbytery, March 26, 1729. \" Out of the first or western society the General Assembly, upon the desire of the inhabitants and consent osthe society, made another society, calling it North-Guilford ; and in June, 1725, the Rev. Mr. Samuel Russell from Branford, was by the laying on of the hands of the presbytery ordained the first pastor of the new church gathered there. He proved a worthy and faithful minister. He deceased January 19, 1746 : and Rev. Mr. John Richards from Waterbury, was ordained by the laying on of the hands osthe presbytery, pastor osthe church, in the month of November, 1748.\" \" He, at his desire, was, by the counsel of the Consociation of New Haven county, dismissed, December, 1765, from his pastoral office there : and Mr. Thomas Wells Bray, from Farmington, was ordained pastor osthe church, December 31, 1766.\" \" Within the limits of the first, the General Assembly made another, calling it the Fourth Society in Guilford, May 10, 1733. Mr. Edmund Ward of Guilford was or dained their pastor ; but being soon dismissed, they did in August 1743, call and or dain Mr. James Sprout, of Middleborough, their pastor ; who being dismissed from them in October, 1768, t they now are destitute of a settled pastor.\" \" In the year 1743, a number of the inhabitants of the First Society declared them selves of the Church of England, and built a house for their public worship. They have no curate, their number small, but meet every sabbath to attend church service. And in 1748 a number at North Guilford also declared for the church, having built a house, and meet on sabbaths for worship. Perhaps there may be about sixty or seventy in all, young and old, belonging lo the whole town of that communion.\" \"It is uncertain who were the first or original planters. The first account of names upon record is so late down as 1650. These forty-six persons following are entered and named as such, viz.

Francis Bushnell Henry Dowd John Stephens Benjamin Wright John Stephen Bishop Thomas Stephens William Boreman Edward Richard John Sheder George Chatfield William Stone Samuel Blatchley Thomas French George Highland Abraham Cruttenden, jr. \"It is a thing evident by this list of planters, that the account of all the original names is not ascertained; for some osthe first planters are not mentioned in it, partic ularly Mr. Coffinge, who was one of the purchasers from the Indians. Tradition concerning is, that he soon died, leaving no other memorial of his name but a small island in the salt meadow near the sea, called to this day Gosling's island. And some thai are named it is certain were not original planters or purchasers, particularly Hubbard and Fowler; ihey came from Hartford or Wethersfield, and as many others were, who came into the town afterwards, admitted planters in it, and had land laid out and assigned to them. Among such was Dr. Bryan Rosseter. One of this Dr. Rosseter's daughters married a Cotton, and bis posterity continue to this time in town. Dr. Rosseter purchased Dr. Desborow's house and lands of him when he left the town with Mr. Whitfield, and returned to England.\" \" As this plantation was connected with New Haven, so they carefully conformed to the agreement in Mr. Newman's barn in all their affairs religious and civil. Like their brethren at New Haven, they adopted and acted upon that unhappy mistake, that it is a thing of more importance to save aud be governed by the steeple than the state. \" Besides [having mentioned the Magistrates' Court, and Town Meetings, or Ge neral Courts, as in Coll. Hist. Soc. iv. 185] they held a Court of Probate. By which court, as often as there was occasion, wills as well as intestate estates were settled. The whole lands belonged to the community. And the title to any particular lands was by order of the town in their meetings. So upon this principle that the fee was really in the community, they in settling estates sometimes departed from the rule of East-Greenwich tenure : And sometimes settled the intestate estates upon the widow, sometimes on one of the children ; or sometimes on a stranger called to the family, as best served the general good of the family, and the prosperity of the infant plantation, in its minority. \"But neither this court nor this practice continued long. As soon as New Ha ven colony government became better settled and more fixed, settling estates was transferred and determined by the court of assistants at New Haven, agreeable to the present rules of the court of probate.\" \" As the town was an immediate part of New Haven government, they were from the early times allowed an assistant or magistrate. Mr. Samuel Desborow, who next to Mr. Whilfield was esteemed the first and richest of the planters, was the first as sistant. The next assistant in the town was Mr. William Leete. He came from England a young but a very hopeful man, as he proved to be afterwards both in New Haven, and, after the union, in Connecticut colony. The family tradition is, that in England he was a clerk in the quarter sessions osthe county, bred for the law. He was an excellent writer, and for many years served as secretary or clerk of the town, all the ancient records being written in his hand; and had a good understanding in the law. His eldest son, John Leete, it is said, was the first child born in the town ; and has left a numerous posterity. He was deputy governor of New Haven colony, and after the union was governor of the colony. He removed to Hartford, and there died and was buried. \" The next magistrate in town was his second son Mr. Andrew Leete. He married a daughter of Mr. Jordan, one osthe original planters. Like his father he proved an excellent man, who, it is said and believed, was the principal hand in securing and preserving the Charter, when it was just upon the point of being given up to Sir Ed mond Andross. In his house it found a safe retirement until better times. Next after Mr. Leete was Mr. Josiah R.osseter, son of Dr. Rosseter, and since him Mr. Abraham Fowler, son of John Fowler. \"The first planters who came to the town were of two ranks, viz. such who in England are called gentlemen and commonality. None were poor men, and few or no servants. The gentlemen were all men of wealth, and they bear the appellation of Mr. as Mr. Desborow, &c. while according to the plain customs of those times the commonality were named only Goodman or Neighbor, such or such an one. How greatly are times now changed ! Every man almost is called Mr., every woman Miss, Madam or Lady. Popularity destroys all civil distinction. \"The first planters, whether Gentlemen or Yeomen, were almost all of them hus bandmen by profession : few tradesmen ; not one blacksmith among them ; it was with great cost the town obtained one to live among them. In this respect they were-"], [230, "216 GUILFORD. quite different from the first settlers of New Haven, although they came with them. The good people who came with Mr. Davenport were Londoners bred to merchan dise, and fixed upon a place proper for trading, which was their design. But Mr. Whitfield's people were quite the reverse, country people, and therefore chose their lands for different ends. Milford and Guilford were some time under consideration ; but at length they fixed their choice upon Guilford. As they came from Kent , &c. so they chose for their plantation land as near like those as they could. \u2014 \u2014 - And what justly deserves to be remembered is, that the ancient skill and spirit of the first plant ers in husbandry has descended, and still continues among their posterity. There fs a certain niceness and delicacy, wherein the perfection of husbandry consists. 1 his is conspicuously to be sound among them. It would be looked upon as a piece of van ity unsufferable, to say all the good husbandry in the country has been learnt from these skillful people. But it is no vanity to say, there is no where better to be sound. All strangers and Europeans agree to say, there is no place in the country to be found where the husbandry so nearly resembles the husbandry in England, especially in the fine piece of land called the Great Plain. \"As the first planters osthe town were, like Jacob, plain men, bred to tillage and keeping cattle: so a great deal of the same temper, and spirit, and manners, remains among their descendants to this day, as it was in Israel among the Rachabites. Indus try, labor, and frugality, are in general the reigning spirit of the inhabitants. There is no such thing as tavern haunting, and little wasting of time in drinking and fruit less diversions,\" the inhabitants are perhaps as little in debt as any town, and possessed of as much solid estate: yet with grief it must be said, that of late years fashionable vices, by a flowing in of strangers, and a great increase of sailors, and some other in cidents, are too sadly predominant. Thus evil communication will ever corrupt good manners. It is a disease, as catching, as deadly as the plague itself. Alas, what a pity is it, that the country in general is so much overspread with and polluted by luxury and its attendants; and these recommended by the fair character of politeness and good breeding! \" The harbor lies south osthe town [of Guilford.] We go through the great plains to it. It is a very poor thing, shallow, and encumbered wilh many rocks. But then about two miles westward from it is an excellent though small harbor. It is land locked on all sides, but the southwest; the entrance or mouth narrow. It is well known by coasters. It is called Sachem's Head. It may not be unentertaining to mention the occasion of its taking this extraordinary name. After the Pequod Indians were driv en from their sorts at Mystick river, they fled to the westward towards Fairfield, the English pursued ihem, and though most of the forces went from the fort at Saybrook by water, a number of soldiers with Uncas and his Indians scoured the shores near the sea, lest any of the Pequods should lurk there. Not a great way from this harbor, they came across a Pequod sachem with a few Indians, whom they pursued. As the south side of the harbor is formed by a long narrow point of land, the Pequods went on to this point, hoping their pursuers would have passed by them. But Uncas knew Indian's craft, and ordered some of his men to search that point. The Pequods, per ceiving that they were pursued, swam over the mouth of the harbor, which is narrow. But they were way-laid, and taken as they landed. The sachem was sentenced to be shot to death. Uncas shot him with an arrow, cut off his head, and stuck it up in the crotch of a large oak tree near the harbor, where the skull remained for a great many years. Thus from this extraordinary incident, the name was adopted to the harbor.\" [From the Connecticut Journal.] Guilford, Aug. 18, 1769. In the town of G d, an under shepherd lately deserted or run away from his flock without leave or license, either from his own or the flocks of the circuit with which he was consociated, having nothing to keep him in countenance but the advice of seven of his brethren, and the concurring yelps of sour of their spaniels. When he come to them, he had neither crook, shoes nor scrip, nor two coats; but soon clothed and warmed himself wilh their fleeces, and very soon became a listener to the bleatings of other flocks, and nothing would stop their din from his ears, but ro stuff them with the fleeces of his own purchase. He may be sound in the cool of the evening rolling in his chaise, with his charming shepherdess,\u2014 had on when he went away, a large presbyterian cloak somewhat soiled, with a full bottomed wig, and five or six hundred pounds of fleece from his flock. Whoever shall secure him, or set him over a herd of goats, till his master's will shall be known, no doubt when the flocks are gathered together, will meet with an ample reward. P. S. The reason why no inquiry has been made after him any sooner, was because he has made several rambles before, of a month or six weeks; it was not known but he would have returned again, and as there is no signs of it at present it is likelv there will be monthly some such inquiry made.

Guilford, May 29th, 1777. No. 502. General Parsons having received intelligence that the enemy had collected, and were collecting large quanlitiesof forage at Sagharbor, on Long Island \u2014 last Fri day about 200 of the continental troops who had previously rendesvous'd at Sachem's Head, ill Guilford, embarked on board a number of whale boats, commanded by Lieut. Col.

As the enemy stationed there were entirely off their guard, our troops met with little opposition ; an armed schooner of 12 guns, which lay not far from the shore, kept an incessant fire on them, but happily did them no damage. Our people returned the fire, with their small arms, but whether with effect is not known ; five or six of the enemy on shore, were destroyed, and three or sour made their escape; the others were made prisoners. Our people set fire to the hay (about 100 tons) which was on board transports, and on the wharves, which was entirely destroyed, with ten transport vessels, mostly sloops and schooners, and one armed vessel of six or eight guns, two or three hogsheads of rum, &c.

Last Monday morning, two armed brigs and a schooner of the enemy's came to off Leete's Island, near Guilford harbor, where they landed about 150 men, who immedi ately proceeded to the dwelling house of Mr. Leete, which they set on fire, together with two barns, which were entirely consumed. They also set fire to another dwell ing house, but the inhabitants of\" the town being alarmed at their first approach, ar rived soon enough to extinguish the flames. The enemy continued on the island about an hour and a half, in which time a large body of the miltlia having collected, very spiritedly attacked them, and, il is supposed, killed and wounded six or seven, as about the same number of muskets were left by them in their flight. Our loss was five wounded, two of which are since dead. The others are in a fair way of recovery. HAM DEN. Hamden was originally included within the limits of New Haven. It was made a distinct town in 1786. There are two societies, Mount Carmel, the northern section of the town, and East Plains, the south ern. The church at Mount Carmel was formed Jan. 26th, 1764. It consisted of members from New Haven and North Haven. The Rev. 28"], [232, "218 H A M D E N . Nathaniel Sherman was installed May 18th, 1768, dismissed August, 1771, and died at East Windsor. The Rev. Joshua Perry was or dained Oct. 15th, 1783, and dismissed 1790. \" The church at East Plains was embodied 1795, and the Rev. Abraham Allen ordained 1796.\" There are now four houses of worship within the limits of this town ; 2 Congregational, 1 Methodist, and 1 Episcopal. Hamden is centrally situated in the county, and is bounded n. by Cheshire and Wallingsord, e. by North Haven, s. by New Haven, and w. by the West Rock range of mountains, separating it from Wood bridge and Bethany. \" Its average length is seven and a half miles, and its average breadth about three and a half, making about 26 square miles. A considerable section of the township is level ; the western border of it is mountainous, and the eastern considerably hilly. The township is situated between the West Rock range of mountains and the East Rock range. East Rock is the termination of an extensive greenstone range of mountains, which extends far into the interior of New England, leading through Cheshire, Soutbington, Farmington, Simsbury and Granby, into Massachusetts. It consists of a broken ridge, or a succession of hills, which become more elevated as you pro ceed from East Rock. At Farmington, Simsbury and Granby, the ridge is more continuous and lofty, and bold in its features. West Rock is the termination of the west range of the same mountain ; it extends as far into the interior as the western section of Soutbington, where it sub sides, or more properly unites with the East Rock range, of which it is properly a branch. This range consists also of greenstone, and is a succession of eminences, and exhibits similar features to the other. Hamden is situated between these two ranges ; the one being upon its western, and the other upon its eastern border. Mount Carmel, which is in some measure an insulated eminence, and appears to be a spur of the East Rock range, lies wholly within this town. This is one of the most elevated greenstone eminences in the State. The greenstone of these mountains forms an excellent building stone, and is extensively used for that purpose in New Haven. In the greenstone hills of this town, various minerals have been discovered. Iron pyrites, in minute pieces, and sometimes imperfectly crystallized, is found disseminated; and sulphuret of copper is sometimes sound, connected with crystallized quartz. At a distant period, a large mass of native copper, weighing about 90 lbs. was accidentally discovered upon one of the greenstone hills of this town. It was preserved for a long time, and the remains of it were used, not more than 15 or 20 years since, in New Haven ; it was said to be very pure, and free from alloy. It is not known pre cisely upon what spot this mass of native copper was found ; but copper is now known to exist in various places, in the greenstone hills of this town. Lead, in small quantities, has also been sound.\"* The following is a south view of the central part of the town, 5J miles from New Haven.

The building seen in the extreme distance stands by the New Haven and Northampton canal ; the elevation beyond is Mount Carmel, which is 8 miles from New Haven. This mountain is one of the most striking objects seen when off the harbor of New Haven. Its western descent is lofty and precipitous. The defile at the soot of the mountain is but barely sufficient in width to admit Mill river, the turnpike and the canal, which at this place is cut through a solid rock. This place is called the Steps. The town is watered by Mill river, a fine mill stream, affording numerous sites for water works. There is 1 manu- factory, called the Carmel Works, 6J miles from New Haven, for man- ufacturing coach and elliptic springs, steps and axletrees : 1 carriage and 1 brass factory, 1 paper mill, and some minor establishments for manu- facturing purposes in other parts of the town. About three miles north from New Haven, upwards of 100 acres of land are now (1836) in a state of preparation for raising mulberry trees, and extensive prepara- tions are making for the silk business. The engraving on the next page shows the appearance of the little village of Whitneyville, as seen from the rise of ground a few rods south, on the New Haven road. This spot, which is two miles from New Haven, is admirably adapted for manufacturing purposes, and justly admired for the romantic beauty of its scenery. The village owes its rise and name to Eli Whitney, Esq. the inventor osthe cotton gin.

A small but handsome Congregational church has been recently erected a little distance north of this village, and is beau tifully situated among the cedars."], [234, "220 HAMDEN. South view of Whitneyville, in Hamden. Mr. Whitney was born at Westborough, Mass. Dec. 8th, 1765. He was educated at Yale College, and soon after he graduated went into the state of Georgia. \" He had been but a short time in Georgia, before he had an opportunity of conver sing with several respectable planters of that state, and of frequently hearing their conversations with each other. In these casual meetings, inquiries relating to the most productive kinds of crops, were topics upon which the planters dwelt with pecu liar interest. Here he learned, that no crop then produced in Georgia, yielded much profit ; that several attempts had been made to raise a species of Cotton, known by the name of Green Seed Cotton ; but which had never been cultivated for the purposes of commerce in any country. The planters informed him, that the shrub, which yielded this cotlon, grew well in Georgia, and was abundantly productive ; but that its fibres adhered so closely to the seed, as to be detached wilh great difficulty ; that no conven ient and efficacious method of separating them had hitherto been discovered ; and that, if this difficulty could be surmounted, this cotton would be a more profitable crop than any which had hitherto been introduced into the southern section of the United States. On these and other occasions the wish was often and ardently expressed, that a machine might be invented for this purpose ; and the declaration made, lhat such an invention would insure an independent fortune to its author. \"A mind always awake and attentive to every thing passing before it, could not easily suffer an object, on which so much stress was laid, to escape without examina tion. Mr. Whitney immediately set himself to investigate the structure of this pro duct, and to devise means for rendering it valuable to mankind. After pursuing his inquiries during a few months, he contrived and executed, under the patronage of Phineas Miller, Esq. a respectable planter in Georgia, a machine entirely new, both in its form and principle, which effectually answered the purpose ; and the utility of which has greatly exceeded every anticipation. \"For this machine he obtained a patent: but, like many other benefactors of the public, had the mortification to see himself plundered of the benefits of his invention. The law, originally made to protect this species of property, was imperfect : and al most all the individuals, composing the courts and juries of Georgia, were personally interested. The machine was converted into a political engine : and demagogues rose into popularity by unsounded and vociferous declamation against this species of right, and the law which was made for its protection. \"To give a detailed account of the expedients, to which recourse was had, in order to defeat the claims of Mr. Whitney, would carry me beyond my limits. Suffice it to observe, that thirteen years of his patent term had expired, during which more than sixty suns were instituted in that state, before any decision on the merits of his claim was obtained; and that, although every such decision has been in his favor the ex penses of prosecution have far exceeded what he has received from the citizens of Georgia."], [235, "HAMDEN. 221 \" The Legislature of South Carolina voted him $50,000 as a purchase osthe patent right for that state. The succeeding Legislature rescinded the vote, and ordered a suit to be instituted against him for the recovery of \u00a920,000 of the purchase money, which had been paid. To the honor of many citizens of that state it ought to be ob served, that this act was regarded by them with the detestation which it merited ; and that to their zealous and honorable exertions it was owing, lhat Mr. Whitney, after much delay and expense, was enabled to obtain a re-establishment osthe contract. '\" The Legislature of North Carolina laid and collected a tax on such of his cotton machines as were then in use in that state, and after deducting the expense of collec tion, paid over the avails of the tax to Mr. Whitney. Though the cultivation of cot ton in the state of North Carolina was then quite limited, and the amount which he received was small, yet the remuneration from that state, was considered by him as more liberal, in proportion to the use of his machines there, than the amount he re ceived from South Carolina. \" The only method of separating the fibres of this cotton from the seed so as to leave it fit for spinning, which was known, anterior to this discovery, was to pick out the seeds, one by one with the fingers ; and it was thought a proof of great dexterity, skill and industry, for one person to clean one pound in a day. Wilh the aid of this ma chine, a single person will, in one day, clean wilh ease a thousand pounds. Asa labor saving machine, therefore, it has, perhaps never been rivalled. \" Before the invention of this machine, it will be remembered, that this species of cotton was not known in commerce: the expense of cleaning it being such, as abso lutely to forbid its cultivation for market. If we add to these considerations the im mense increase of wealth derived from it to the southern states, the incomprehensible increase of cheap, comfortable, and even handsome clothing, especially for the poor and middle classes of mankind, the value of this invention can hardly be exaggerated, or its benefits too highly appreciated.\"* Notwithstanding the immense importance of this invention to the southern states, \"an invention,\" says Judge Johnson, of South Caro lina, \" by which their lands trebled in value,\" Mr. Whitney declared to a friend, near the close of his life, \"that all he had received for the invention osthe cotton gin, had not more than compensated him for the enormous expenses which he had incurred, and for the time which he had devoted during many of the best years of his life, in the prosecution of this subject. He therefore felt that his just claims on the cotton growing states, especially on those that had made him no returns for his invention, so important to his country, were still unsatisfied, and that both justice and honor required that compensation should be made.\" In 1798, Mr. Whitney became deeply impressed with the uncer tainty of all his hopes sounded on the cotton gin, and of the necessity of devoting himself to some business in order to sustain himself and family. The enterprise which he selected in accordance with these views, was the manufacture of arms for the United States. Through the influence of the Hon. Oliver Wolcott, Secretary of the Treasury, he obtained a contract for ten thousand stand of arms. The contract was concluded Jan. 14th, 1798, upon which he purchased the site in Hamden and erected his works. \"Several other persons made contracts with the government at about the same time, and attempted the manufacture of muskets, following, substantially so far as they understood it, the method pursued in England. The result of their efforts was a complete failure to manufacture muskets of the quality required, at the price agreed to be paid by the government : and in some instances they expended in the execution of their contracts a considerable fortune in addition to the whole amount received for their work. \" The low state to which the arts had been depressed in this country by the policy of England, under the colonial system, and from which they had then scarcely begun to recover, together with the high price of labor, and other causes, conspired to render * Dr. Dwight."], [236, "222 HAMDEN. it impracticable at lhat time even for those most competent to the undertaking, to manufacture muskets here in the English method. And doubtless Mr. wniiney would have shared the fate of his enterprising but unsuccessful competitors, nan oe adopted the course which they pursued; but his genius struck out lor him a course entirely new. \u25a0 \" In maturing his system he had many obstacles to combat, and a much longer ume was occupied, than he had anticipated; but with his characteristic firmness ne pur sued his object, in the face of the obloquy and ridicule of his competitors, the evil predictions of his enemies, and the still more discouraging and disheartening mis givings, doubts, and apprehensions of his friends. His efforts were at last crownea wilh success, and he had the satisfaction to find, that the business which had proven so ruinous to others, was likely to prove not altogether unprofitable to hnnsell. \" Our limits do not permit us to give a minute and detailed account of the system ; and we shall only glance at two or ihree of its more prominent features, for the pur pose of illustrating its general character. \" The several parts osthe musket were, under this system, carried along tbrougn the various processes of manufacture, in lots of some hundreds or thousands of each. In their various stages of progress, they were made to undergo successive operations by machinery, which not only vastly abridged the labor, but at the same time so fixed and determined their form and dimensions, as to make comparatively little skill ne cessary in the manual operations. Such was the construction and arrangement of this machinery, lhat it could be worked by persons of little or no experience ; and yet it performed the work wilh so much precision, that when, in the laler stages ol the pro cess, the several parts of the musket came to be put together, they were as readily adapted to each other, as if each had been made for its respective fellow. A lot of these parts passed through the hands of several different workmen successively, (and in some cases several times returned, at intervals more or less remote, to the bands of the same workman,) each performing upon them every time some single and simple operation, by machinery or by hand, until they were completed. Thus Mr. Whitney reduced a complex business, embracing many ramifications, almost to a mere succes sion of simple processes, and was thereby enabled lo make a division of the labor among his workmen, on a principle which was not only more extensive, but altogether more philosophical, than that pursued in the English method. In England, the labor of making a musket was divided by making the different workmen the manufacturers of different limbs, while in Mr. Whitney's system the work was divided wilh reference 10 its nature, and several workmen performed different operations on the same limb. \" It will be readily seen that under such an arrangement any person of ordinary ca pacity would soon acquire sufficient dexterity lo perform a branch of the work. In deedj so easy did Mr. Whitney find it to instruct new and inexperienced workmen, that he uniformly preferred to do so, rather than to attempt to combat the prejudices of those who had learned the business under a different system. \" When Mr. Whitney's mode of conducting the business was brought into success ful operation, and the utility of his machinery was fully demonstrated, the clouds of prejudice which lowered over his first efforts, were soon dissipated, and he had the sat isfaction of seeing not only his system, but most of his machinery, introduced into ev ery other considerable establishment for the manufacture of arms, both public and pri vate, in the United States.\"* The following is from the muster roll of the first company organized in the East Plains society, in Hamden. It is stated to be \" A true Roll osthe 17th company, or train band, of the second regiment in the col ony of Connecticut, under the command of Colonel Edward Ailing, Esq.

Most of these were killed outright, at the west end of Broadway, by a discharge of grape shot from the enemy. Capt. Stephen Ford, who was a member of the Hamden company, and from whom the foregoing roll was ob tained, is still living in Hamden. He states that Capt. Gilbert was wounded in the leg at the discharge mentioned above : he fled for his horse, which was tied near the College, and as he was not able to go very fast, he was overtaken by Capt. Parker: Capt. Gilbert offered to surrender, if his life could be spared. Parker, calling him a d d rebel, ordered a soldier to shoot him down. Upon this, Capt. Gilbert discharged his gun at Parker, who fell from his horse, badly wounded ; of course Capt. Gilbert was immediately killed. Connecticut Gazette, (New London,) July 12, 1782. No. 974. New Haven, June 26, 1782. Last Monday morning about 9 o'clock, Mrs. Mary Edwards, the consort osthe Rev. Mr. Jonathan Edwards of this town, was drowned in Mr. Sabine's mill pond.* She rode out in a chair, with a view to transact some domestic affairs with a family about two miles from town, and coming to the pond, appeared to have turned the horse with a view to water him at a place which appeared smooth and convenient for the purpose ; but the shore a few feet from the edge of the pond was uncommonly steep, descending at once, and the horse, probably eager to drink, and pressing forward too far, plunged instantly into eight or ten feet water. No person saw Mrs. Edwards when she was drowning, but a lad on horseback just behind her, hearing a person scream, rode forward, and seeing the horse and chair in the pond, immediately alarmed the neighborhood. The waters were so deepand muddy, that it was an hour and a half before she was found, though the utmost exertions were made. The physi cian tried every probable expedient for more than an hour to recover her, but in vain. The jury gave their verdict that she was accidentally drowned. * * * * Her funeral was attended yesterday, when an animated and exceedingly tender ser mon was preached from Phil. i. 21, to a very numerous and solemn audience, by the Rev.

Lee's Academy and Congregational Church in Madison. This town was incorporated in 1826. Its limits embrace what was formerly the second and fourth ecclesiastical societies in Guilford. There are now two parishes; Madison, formerly called East Guilford, and North Madison, formerly North Bristol. The town is about nine miles in length, and may average perhaps about four in breadth. The lands in Madison, the south parish, by the use of white fish as a ma nure, have become quite productive. These fish were first used here for this purpose in the summer of 1798. It is believed they were first used as a manure in this country on Long Island. This fishery com mences about the first of June, and continues for three or sour months. From 10 to 15,000 fish are considered as a sufficient dressing for an acre of ground. The best method of using them is thought to be to plow them in : a great proportion are left on the top of the ground, \u2014 a fish thrown on a hill of corn or potatoes makes a material difference in the produce. These fish are now extensively used in the maritime towns in the state. Madison produces considerable quantities of pota toes for exportation, rye, Indian corn, &c. There are a number of quarries near the shore, from which considerable quantities of paving stone are taken for exportation. Ship building is the leading mechan ical business done in the place. North Madison is rocky and hilly, and it is believed that full one half of the land is unfit for cultivation, and is left for the growth of wood. Great quantities of excellent charcoal are made in this parish, which is carried to New Haven and Middletown for a market.

The principal part of the buildings in this society are situated on one street, passing through the town, and running a short distance from and paral lel with the sea coast. The Rev. John Hart was the first minister in Madison. In May, 1703, the General Assembly formed the society of East Guilford. Mr. Hart was ordained the first pastor of the newly gathered church, in November, 1707. He was from Farmington, and was a preacher of the first eminence in his day. He died March 4th, 1732, aged 49. Their next minister was the Rev. Jonathan Todd, from New Haven, who was ordained in 1733. The first minister in North Madison, was the Rev. Richard Ely, from Lyme, who was ordained here June 8th, 1757. Mr. Nathan Bradley* was one osthe first settlers of this town. He built his house about two and a half miles eastward of Madison church, and near the Killingworth line. He was but a lad when he came from England. He intended to have landed at New Haven, but was obliged to land at Saybrook, and come across the wilderness to New Haven, there being no settlement at that time between that place and Saybrook. Mr. Bradley, who was quite a hunter, was the first white person who dis covered the source osHammonasset river, which originates in a pond still called Nathan's pond. Mr. B. lived to an advanced age, and it is said that he killed several hundred deer while he resided in this town. In the winter season, bears, wolves, and other wild animals, would resort to the sea coast in considerable numbers. Mr. B. in his old age went to see a friend who lived about a mile northerly from the present meeting house in Madison. On his way he was met by a bear and her cubs. He endeavored to ride round her, but as he moved, the bear moved ; when he stopped, she stopped, and sitting on her haunches, presented an undaunted front, and seemed determined to oppose his farther pro gress. Mr. B. was obliged to turn back, and being somewhat childish in his old age, shed tears, that he who had killed so many of these creatures, should be obliged at last to turn his back upon one of them. Some of the inhabitants of Madison follow the sea-faring business. In accordance with this occupation, some of the inscriptions on the monuments in the grave yard west osthe Academy, correspond. The following is from a tabular monument in memory of Capt. E. Griffin.

But he was amply rewarded for his enterprise, having made a valuable location of land, upon the beautiful alluvial osthe Onion river, which soon became valuable, and enabled him to leave a large estate to his posterity. He was also hon ored with she confidence of the public, and attained to distinguished public employments, having been elected the first governor of that state, in March, 1778. He died August 25th, 1797.* Ebenezer Chittenden, brother to the preceding, was possessed of a great mechanical genius, and was the inventor of a machine for cutting and bending card teeth. This was before the Revolution. Being of an open and communicative disposition, some person, taking advantage of this trait in his character, obtained a knowledge of his invention, went to England and took out a patent, claiming himself to have been the original inventor. MERIDEN. Meriden was originally a society in the town of Wallingsord, and was incorporated as a town in 1806. The society was formed in 1725, \" It consisted at first of between 30 and 40 families. They had preach ing only in the winter season, for the first three years, and met in a pri vate house two winters. Their first meetino- house was built in 1727. The Rev. Theophilus Hall went to preach to them in December, 1728. The next year a church was gathered, and Mr. Hall was ordained their pastor. Their second meeting house was built in 1755. Mr. Hall died in 1767, in the 60th year of his age and 38th of his ministry. He was much esteemed as a preacher of great firmness and stability, and a zeal ous advocate for civil and religious liberty. \"f The following view is rather east of south ; the first building on the left, before which a stage is passing, is the Episcopal, the next the Bap tist, the other is the Congregational church, which is the largest of the three.

The soil in the town is a gravelly and sandy loam, and is considerably fer tile, producing grass, grain, &ic. The Quinnipiac river passes through the southwestern part of the town, and several of its branches run through the interior. This is one of the most flourishing and enterprising manufacturing towns in the State. There is a considerable variety of manufactures here, forming the chief employment of the inhabitants. The follow ing is a list of the manufactories, viz. 2 for patent augers and auger bits, 3 for ivory combs, 6 for tin ware, 4 for Britannia ware, 2 iron sounde ries, 1 manufactory for coffee mills, 1 for clocks, 1 for Norfolk door latches, 3 for block-tin spoons, 1 for wood combs, 1 for skates and iron rakes, and 1 for gridirons. The value of articles manufactured yearly, has been estimated from 800,000 to 1,000.000 of dollars. The Meri den Bank is located in the village. About thirty years since a road was constructed from the northwest ern part of Meriden to Berlin, through a narrow and romantic glen, be tween two ridges of the Blue Mountains; this pass, which is more than a mile in extent, is called the Cat Hole. In some parts of this glen there is but barely room for a path ; small angular fragments of rocks rise on each side, at about an angle of forty five degrees ; these rocks have been beaten down and covered with earth, which must have been brought here for the purpose.

The tradition is, tha the regicides, in their wanderings, came to Mer iden, and made a stopping place on the bank of a stream west of the churches, and gave it the name of \" Pilgrim's Harbor.\" \" It is now spoken of as the \" harbor,\" as much or as familiarly as that at New Haven.\" The first stage in Connecticut ran through Meriden, on the old country road west osthe central village, where the rail road is now located ; this was in 1784. At or before the union of the colonies of Connecticut and New Haven, there was a grant made to a Mr. Belcher of a tract of land containing five hundred acres, upon condition of his building a stone house or fort with port holes, and to keep arms and ammunition. With the land, he was to have the right of keeping tavern forever. Belcher did not come himself, but it appears he sent some one to take his place. The house or sort was erected between the years 1660 and 1667. This building proving too small, another was erected about 1690. This re mained and was occupied till after the close of the Revolutionary war, with the addition of a wooden building, and whoever lived there kept tavern if they pleased, until the turnpike was made in 1799. It was situated in quite the upper part osthe town, on the old road, and was a noted place during the French and Revolutionary wars. The village where the half-way tavern now is, has all been built during the last fifty years, with the exception of two or three houses."], [243, "229 MIDDLEBURY. MILFORD. MIDDLEBURY. Middlebury was incorporated as a town in 1807. It was formed from a section of the towns of Waterbury, Woodbury and Southbury. It derived its name from the fact of its occupying a middle position in reference to these towns. It is 22 miles from New Haven, and 36 from Hartford, bounded n. by Watertown and Woodbury, w. by Wood bury, s. by Oxford, and e. by Waterbury. It is about five miles in length from north to south, and has an average breadth of about sour. The surface osthe town is hilly and rocky, and its appearance rather rough and sterile. The rocks are principally granite, and the soil is a hard, coarse, gravelly loam, affording tolerable grazing ; rye is cultiva ted with some success. The town forms one Congregational society, and a seciety of Methodists, each of which has a house of worship in the center of the town. The number of inhabitants in 1830 was S16, being 31 less than there were in 1810. Agriculture is the prin cipal business of the inhabitants. A satinet factory has, however, been recently erected at the outlet of Quasepaug pond or lake, a body of water on the western border of the town, which discharges its waters into the Housatonic. This pond, in some places, is of great depth, and furnishes at its outlet very superior water privileges. There is in the place a pump manufactory upon a new plan, recently invented by Mr. Daniel Abbot. About a mile north of the meeting houses in this town, is a hill of considerable elevation, called Break neck hill. It derives its name from the circumstance of one osthe cattle falling and breaking its neck in descending the bill, while employed in transporting the baggage of the troops under the command of Gen. La Fayette. The army, which was passing from the eastward to Hudson river, encamped one night on the summit of this bill. La Fayette and some of his officers lodged in a tavern in the valley eastward, then kept by Mr. Isaac Bronson. A new house has been recently erected on the site by his grandson. MILFORD. Milford is one of the oldest towns in Connecticut. It was one of the six plantations which composed the \" Old Jurisdiction of New Ha ven.\" The settlement was commenced in 1639. The first purchase of land was made osthe Indians on the 12th of February, which com prehended about two miles of what is now the center osthe town. The deed was given to Mr. William Fowler, Edmond Tapp, Zacheriah Whitman and Alexander Bryan, in trust for the body of planters. The consideration was \"6 coats, 10 blankets, 1 kettle, besides a number of hoes, knives, hatchets and glasses.\" The instrument was signed by Ansantawae, the sagamore, by Arracowset, Anshuta, Manamatque and others. Afterwards at different times other purchases were made. The"], [244, "230 MILFORD. tract lying west of the settlement, on the Housatonic river, was bought on the 20th of December, 1659, for the sum of \u00a326, to be paid in goods. The Indian Neck, lying between the East river and the Sound, was purchased on the 2d of January, 1659-60, for the consideration of \u00a325. A reservation of 20 acres was made by the Indians in this tract for planting ground, which reservation they sold on the 12th of Decem- ber, 1661, for six coats, two blankets and two pair of breeches. By this last agreement, \" Ansantawae, and wife, and his sons Tountone- moe and Ankeanach, in case of danger,\" were granted \" liberty to sit down for shelter in some place near the town, where the townsmen should think most fit.\" A tract of land lying above the path that goeth from Derby to New Haven, a mile and six score rods in breadth, was bought on the 17th of June, 16S5. A tract, commonly called the two- bit purchase, \" lying north of Bladen's brook, and extending to Lebanon brook, a mile and six score rods in breadth,\" was bought on the 29th of February, 1700, for the consideration of \u00a315 in pay, and 15s. in sil- ver; and that tract commonly denominated the one-bit purchase lying north of Lebanon brook, and running upward to Beacon hill river, a mile and six score rods in breadth, was purchased on the 23d day of February, 1702, for \u00a35 in money, or otherwise \u00a37 10*. in pay. Thus it appears that the town once extended 20 miles north to Waterbury line, but its territory has been ceded to help form other towns, till it is now contracted into a little triangle of about 6 miles in length on each side. Parts of these ancient purchases are now contained in the towns of Waterbury, Derby, Woodbridge and Orange. The town is (now) bounded west by the Housatonic river, southeast by Long island sound, and northeast by Orange. The Indian name of the place was Wepawaug. The original settlers were mostly from the counties of Essex and York. A number of them came to New England with Messrs. Eaton and Davenport's company, and remained with them at New Haven during the year of 1638. Their pastor, Mr. Peter Prudden, (from Edgeton, Yorkshire,) preached with the people of Wethersfield. who at that time had no minister, while his congrega tion were making preparation to commence the settlement. While he officiated there, a number became so attached to him, that when he left, they accompanied him, and incorporated with his church. These were before from Watertown, Massachusetts, and were part of Sir Richard Saltonstall's company. The first planters of the town stand enrolled in the following order on the first page of Lib. I. of Milford Records.

From some data on the Record, there is reason to suppose this calculation not too large. The following is a list of the principal after planters : Henry Allen Edward Adams Joshua Atwater Joseph Ashburn Hants Albers Thomas Andrew Thomas Bayley Stephen Freeman John Fisk Nathaniel Gould Joseph Guernsey Thomas Hine Richard Haughton Thomas Hayes John Prindle Joseph Peck Roger Piitchard David Phillips Edward Riggs William Roberts Thomas Read Thomas Beardsley Richard Holbrook Joseph Sill John Brown Richard Hollingworth Richard Shute Roger Betts Walter Joye Thomas Betts Simon Lobdell John Smith John Stream John Slone Thomas Beach Jonathan Law John Stone Thomas Campfield Jesse Lambert Vincent Stilson Robert Denison Miles Merwin Peter Simpson Gilbert Dalison Miles Moore Edward Turner Charles Deal Jonathan Marsh Henry Tomlinson Robert Downs Thomas Mecock William Tyler Samnel Eells Samuel Nettleton Edward Wooster Thomas Farman Roger Newton Edward Wilkinson Nathaniel Farrand Francis Norton Thomas Ward John Ford Abraham Pierson Joseph Waters Thomas Ford James Prime Twelve osthe first settlers afterwards removed, viz. Richard Miles to New Haven ; Thomas Tapping to Southampton, L. I., but returned in 1773. John Astwood went to England as agent for the Court of Com missioners osthe United Colonies, and died in London in 1654. Hen ry Stonhill (in 1648) and Philip Hatly (in 1649) returned to London. John Peacocke removed in 1651 to Newport, (R. I.); Thomas Baker in 1650 to East Hampton; Edward Harvey and Henry Lyon in 1654 to Fairfield; George Hubbard in 1650; John Fowler in 1660; Andrew Benton in 1666 to Guilford; John Birdsey in 1649 to Stratford. The body of planters moved from New Haven to Milford by land, following the devious Indian foot path, driving ther cattle and other domestic animals before them, while their household utensils and the materials for \" the common house\" (which was fitted at New Haven)"], [246, "232 MILFORD. were taken round by water. Thomas Tibbals piloted the company through the woods to the place. \" he having been there a number of times before; for which service the town, in 1670, \" made him two grants of land lying in Westfield as a free gift.\" All safely arrived ; they erected their common house at the head of the harbor on the west side, and a few rude huts for temporary residences. They then pro ceeded to form their civil polity. Considering themselves as without the Dale of jurisdiction, (as in fact they were until they united with New\" Haven in 1644,) they combined into a little republic. At their first general meeting, Nov. 20th, 1639, it was voted \" that the power of electing officers and persons to divide the land into lots, to take order for the timber, and to manage the common interests of the plantation, should be in the church only. It was also voted that they would guide themselves in all their doings by the rule of the written Word of God, till such time as a body of laws should be established.\" William Fowler, Edmond Tapp, Zechariah Whitman, John Astwood and Richard Miles, were then chosen for judges in all civil affairs, to try all causes between man and man ; and as a court to punish any of fense and misdemeanor. It was \"voted that the persons invested with magistracy should have power to call a general court (or town meeting) whenever they might see cause, or the public good require it.\" It was also voted that they should hold particular courts once in. six weeks, wherein should be tried such causes as might be brought before them, they to examine witnesses upon oath as need should require. It was further voted and agreed, that according to the sum of money which each person paid toward the public charges, in such proportion should he receive or be repaid in lands, and that all planters who might come after should pay their share equally for some other public use. The first settlers located themselves on each side of the Mill river and the West End brook, probably for the convenience of water for themselves and cattle. Most of them soon erected frame houses, cov ered with rent oak clapboards, in the old leanto style. Their house lots were laid out in parallel narrow slips, containing each about three acres. They thus kept near together for their better security in case of an attack from the Indians. They immediately fenced in common three tracts of land, in which each individual received by lot his portion of \" upland.\" Westfield, which was the land that lies south of the town between the turnpike and great meadow, was laid out to those who settled at the west end. Eastfield, which enclosed the Gulf Neck, was possessed by those located on the river. Mill Neck, the tract ly ing between Wharf street and Bear Neck lane, was owned by a part of both. Each person was further allotted a piece of meadow land lying either in the great or the harbor meadows. As the population increas ed and the danger from the Indians became less, the land further from the center was gradually laid out and settled. At the second General Court, held March 9th, 1640, \"It was agreed between William Fowler and the brethren that he should build a mill and have her going by the last of September.\" For his encourage-"], [247, "233 MILFORD. ment the town made him a grant of 30 acres of land, which long bore the name of the mill lot. This agreement had reference only to a grist mill, but he soon added a saw mill. This mill establishment is yet re tained in the family. At the next General Court held Novembers 24th, 1640, \" With common consent and general vote of the freemen, the plantation was named Milford,\" in commemoration of the town of this name in their native England. The Court of five Judges at this meet ing were directed \" to build a bridge over the Mill river with all expe dition,\" and also \" to set out a meeting house thirty feet square, alter such manner as they should judge the most convenient for the public good.\" The site of the building was the same of the present meeting bouse of the first society. In 1709, this house had become so much crowded that it was voted in town meeting that \" whosoever should needlessly set out of his seat, should forfeit the sum of five shillings to the town treasury.\" It stood until 1727. The first settlers being of those people who left England that they might enjoy their religious sentiments unmolested, they took an early opportunity to form themselves into a church constituted according to their particular views. It was organized at New Haven at the same time with the church in that place on the 2d of August, 1639. The method of forming their churches was similar to that of New Haven. Seven persons were first chosen, who joined in covenant to be the church, and were called \" the pillars.\" To these the rest were added. They took their plan from the text, \" Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars.\" Milford church pillars were Peter Prudden, pastor, William Fowler, Edmond Tapp, Zechariah Whitman, John Astwood, Thomas Buckingham, Thomas Welch. Mr. Prudden was installed at New Haven on the 18th of April, 1640. John Sherman was chosen teacher, (but declined the office.) Zechariah Whitman was ordained ruling elder June 26, 1645. The ministers of this church since Mr. Prudden, have been Roger Newton, installed August 22d, 1660. Samuel Andrew, ordained Nov. 18, 1685. Samuel Whittlesey, ordained Nov. 9, 1737. Samuel Wales, ordained Dec. 19, 1770. In 1776 he went into the army as chaplain. William Lockwood, ordained March 17, 1784, and Bezaleel Pinneo, the present pastor, who was ordained on the 26th of October, 1796. This church, for more than a century, was the only one in the town \u2014 their present meeting house was built in 1S24. In 1741, some persons (47 in number) being dissatisfied with Mr. Whittlesey's more moderate religious opinions, \" declared their sober dissent from the established church, and professed themselves to be Presbyterians according to the church of Scotland.\" They were soon joined by twelve others, and the society continued gradually to increase. They had to encounter much violent opposition from the first church, and were not invested with full privileges as an ecclesiastical society till the session of the Legislature in May, 1760. They erected their meeting house in November, 1742. Their first settled minister was Job Prudden, a native of this town, (great grandson of Peter Prudden.) He was ordained at New Brunswick, in May, 1747. The succeeding 30"], [248, "234 MILFORD. ministers have been Josiah Sherman, David Tully, Sherman Johnson, Caleb Pitkin, Jehu Clark, and the present, Asa M. Train. Ihe meet ing house at present occupied by the society, was built during the sum mer of 1834. It is seen on the right, with six pillars in front. Caleb ing ho in er c Congregational Churches in Milford. The above is a south view of Milford ; they are but a few rods the two Congregational churches in apart, separated by the Wepawaug, a mill stream passing through the center of the village. A small but beautiful mill pond is directly south of these churches, and adds very much to the variegated, pleasant, and interesting scenery in the imme diate vicinity. The Episcopal and Baptist churches, and the town house, are about forty rods south osthe churches seen in the engraving. The first cause of there being two societies in this place was owing to the settlement of the Rev. Mr. Whittlesey as pastor, about the year 1740. The Rev. Samuel Andrew (who for a long period was the minister in this town) became through age and many infirmities unable to perform the labor of the ministry; Mr. Whittlesey was invited to preach and settle in the place as colleague pastor ; this occasioned a division among the people. Although there was a majority for Mr. Whittlesey, yet there was a strong and respectable minority in opposi tion to his settlement ; it arose on account of his adopting in some measure Arminian sentiments. An ecclesiastical council was held, in which Dr. Trumbull says he was informed \" by one of the elders, who was one of the council, that the debate was with so much passion, that fists were doubled on the occasion.\" All attempts at union having \"failed, the disaffected part of the society withdrew and erected a house of worship for themselves in 1742, and placed themselves under the presbytery of New Brunswick. The Episcopal society was formed in January, 1764. The church was raised in 1771, and consecrated by the name of St. George's church, in March, 1775. They also suffered much opposition, and were con-"], [249, "235 MILFORD. sidered by many as akin to the church of Rome. But old prejudices have in a measure subsided, and the church at present is in a flourishing state. There is a small but respectable Baptist church in the town, which owes its origin to the Rev. James H. Linsley, of Stratford. In 1644, Milford united with the New Haven jurisdiction, which then consisted of New Haven, Stamford, Guilford and Southold, L. I. They met with some difficulty in gaining admission, on account of having \" for merly taken in as free burgesses, six planters who were not in church fellowship,\" but were received on condition that these six men should \" never be chosen deputies, or into any public trust for the combination, nor be allowed to vote at any time in the election of magistrates, and that none should afterwards be admitted freemen but church members.\" The town, under this jurisdiction, had two magistrates, and sent two deputies to the general court at New Haven. William Fowler and Edmond Tapp, were the first magistrates, after the union, and John Astwood and John Sherman, first deputies. In May, 1685, the town received a patent from the general court; afterwards, making further purchases osthe Indians, they petitioned for a new one, which might comprehend all their territory. Accordingly the governor and company granted them another, which is dated the 22d day of May, A. D. 1713. It appears by this patent, that at that time there were 235 freeholders in the town. The Indians, at the settlement of the town, were numerous. They had four considerable villages, viz. one on the side of the Wepawaug river, near the church ; one at the point ; another about half a mile north of Washington bridge, and another at Turkey Hill. Here they had a strong fortress, with flankers at the sour corners, which was de signed as a defense against the Mohawks. At the settlement of the English, the Indians in the center of the place retired to Indian point, lying between East river and the Sound. Here they lived for 20 years. For security against the Indians, the planters enclosed the town plot with palisadoes, so thickly set that a man could not crowd between them. This enclosure was nearly a mile square, and was on both sides of the Wepawaug river. It even tually proved fortunate for the English that this was done. For in the years 1645 and '46, the Indians were hostile and very troublesome, so much so that the planters, for their mutual safety, kept guard night and day. Each soldier stood as sentinel every fifth day, and was relieved at sunset by drum beat. On their \" Sabbath and lecture days,\" they went armed to meeting, and when in the fields, their muskets were kept near at hand. About this time the Indians set the adjacent country on sire, and it was supposed they meant to burn the town; but the planters were so fortunate as to arrest the progress of the flames at the swamp on the west and north of the settlement, before they reached the palisadoes, and thus saved their buildings. But the sire did much damage ; most of the timber was destroyed, and a number of pieces of good natural meadow was so burnt that they became sunken swamps."], [250, "236 MILFORD. The Indians were again troublesome in 1653, and the people were under the apprehension of a sudden and general massacre. They were greatly hindered in their farming avocations, and worn down with inces sant watching. In the spring of 1700, so much danger was apprehen ded from the natives, that two houses were ordered to be fortified, (one on the east side of the river, and one at the west end.) for the security of women and children, the aged and decrepid, in case of surprise. All persons over 16 years of age were ordered forthwith to work until the fortifications were completed. This was a time of general alarm, for 4 or 5 years, throughout the country. But there is nothing on record to show that any English person was ever killed by the Indians in Milford. About 1648, there was a famous battle fought between the Milford Indians and the Mohawks. The latter had secreted themselves in a swamp, nearly a mile east of the ferry, intending to surprise the In dians in the sort that night. The English accidentally discovering them, notified the Milford Indians, who, setting.up the war whoop, soon raised such numbers, that they ventured to attack the invaders. The Mo hawks were defeated, and several of them taken. One of their fallen chiefs they buried on a hillock in the swamp. A stout captive was stripped and tied by the Milford Indians in the great meadows, for the musquitoes to eat and torment to death. But he was discovered and relieved by one Thomas Hine. Many of the Wepawaug Indians eventually went off to the west and joined with the Six Nations, while some few remained about the town; but they have now all disappeared. In all the wars in which the country has been engaged, Milford has furnished its proportion of money and soldiers. In King Philip's war, and in the two French wars, the town lost a good number of men, who died of sickness in the camp or fell in bat tle. In the French and Indian war, companies of the British troops quartered in the place during the winters of 1757 and 1758 at the town's expense. The last winter, in a revel, they burnt the town house, upon which the government sent over \u00a350 towards the erection of a new one. In a number of men from the town accompanied Gen. Putnam in the expedition to Cuba. At the commencement osthe Revolution, the inhabitants were unanimously oppos ed to the oppressive measures of the British ministry, and opened a subscription \" for the relief and support of such poor inhabitants of Boston as were immediate sufferers by the Port Bill.\" In 1776, a battery was built at West Point, on the west side of the harbor, for the defense of the town ; men were stationed at Burwell's farm, and at the Point, and a Minute Post kept in readiness in case of emergency. The town furnished a full quota of men for the army, who marched under the command of Capt. Samuel Peck. The select men were directed to \" furnish guns, bayonets and provisions for such as were called forth for the defense osthe Liberty of America.\" A premium of\u00a310was offered per head for men to enlist during the war. This town suffered comparatively little during the war from the incursions of the British. There were no buildings burnt and but one house plundered, (lhat of Miles Merwin at Pond Point.) But much property was lost by burying, and by exposure lo the weather in the woods. The inhabitants contributed libel ally for the relief of Fairfield, Danbury and Nor walk. There were but few tories in the town during these times, and those few were compelled to keep close to their houses. Of the soldiers of the revolution, there are but a few remaining in the town. This town has given to Connecticut two governors, viz. Robert Treat, and Jonathan Law, Esqs., both of whom were eminent statemen. Robert Treat and his brother Richard came to New England with Sir Richard Saltonslall, and were among the first settlers of Wethersfield. Robert left that settle ment and came to Milford with Mr. Prudden. At the first meeting of the planters he was chosen to assist in surveying and laying out the township. He was soon cho sen one of the five Judges, and in 1GG1 was elected a magistrate of the colony, in"], [251, "MILFORD. 237 which office he was continued four years, until he refused to take the oath prescribed by law, he being in favor of the union of the colony with Connecticut. In 1664, I lie town, by his influence, and that of Mr. Benjamin Fenn, was induced to break off from New Haven colony; and it was by his influence particularly, that the union was so soon effected. He was appointed Major of the Connecticut troops in 1G70. In Phil ip's war, at the attack of Springfield by the Indians in 1G75, he marched to its relies, and drove them from the town; and in their assault upon Hadley, he put them com pletely to flight. The same year, in December, he performed a distinguished part in the destruction of the Indians at fort Narragansett. In 167G, he was elected Deputy Governor, and in 168G, Governor of Connecticut, to which last office he was annually re-elected for fifteen years, till he declined serving. His wife was Jane, only daughter ol Edniond Tapp, Esq. Concerning this match there is the following traditionary anecdote. \u2014 Being in at Mr. Tapp's, he took the girl upon his knee and commenced trolling her. Robert, said she, be still that, I had rather be Treated than trotted, upon which he proposed marriage, which was immediately consented to by all concerned. He died July 12th, in the b'Jth year of his age, aud left four suns and four daughters. Gov. Law was the only son of Jonathan and Sarah Law, (the daugh ter of George Clark, sen., planter,) and grandson of Richard Law, one of the first settlers of Stamford. He was born August 6, 1674, and was educated at Harvard College, where he graduated in 1695. He commenced the practice of law in his native town in 1698, and acqui red great reputation as a counsellor. In 1706, he was made a justice of the peace \u2014 in 1710, a justice osthe quorum \u2014 in 1714, chief judge, and in 1717, he was chosen an assistant, which office he filled until he was chosen deputy governor. In May, 1741, he was elected governor, and annually re-elected, till his death. He died Nov. 6th, 1750, and left 7 sons and a widow, his fifth wife. The ancestors of Governors John Cotton Smith and Gideon Tomlinson were from Milford, likewise Abraham Clark, of New Jersey, one of the signers of the Declara tion of Independence. The early inhabitants osthe town took a particular interest in (lie subject of education. In 1G97, it was voted \" there should be thirty five pounds al lowed out of the town treasury, to maintain a Latin school ; the Honorable Governor, and the Rev. Samuel Andrew, to be a committee to attend to the business.\" This Mr. Andrew was one osthe principal projectors, and early patrons of Yale College. Mil ford has sent out many colonists towards the settlement of other towns. Wean linoque was purchased of the Indians on the 8th of February, 1702-3, by the people of the town, and settled by the name of New Milford. Newark, in New Jersey, Dur ham in Connecticut, and Talmadge in Ohio, received most of their early settlers from Mil foul. There are no mountains, and very little broken land, in the town. The soil is generally good and productive ; but the culture is not man aged on the scientific principles that might be wished. There is a quarry of beautiful serpentine marble in the east part of the town, which was wrought about eighteen years since, but is now neglected. The harbor of the town is not deep. It has been gradually filling up since the first settlement, at which time there was water enough to ad mit a large sea brig up to Fowler's mills. A breakwater has been pro posed to be built from Indian point toward the island, by which a capa cious harbor would be formed. Milford Island lies about three fourths of a mile from the shore, and contains about ten acres of land. It was called Poquahaug by the In dians, and was a favorite summer resort of those people. Ansantawae, the sachem, had a \"big wigwam\" upon it, for his accommodation. After the settlement osthe English, it was laid out to George Hubbanl, who sold it to Richard Bryan. At a town meeting held on the 17th of March, 1657, Charles Deal, tobacco planter, was granted liberty to"], [252, "238 MILFORD. purchase and enjoy the Island fora tobacco plantation, provided he use the buildings for no other use than a tobacco house, and that he do not trade with the Dutch or Indians, or suffer any disorderly resort ot sea men or others there. In 1835, it was purchased by John Harris, ISsq. of New York, who erected a seat, and fitted it up for a summer resi dence. Between the Island and shore there is a bar, which is bare haft the time. Good clams grow on this bar. Poconock or Milford point, at the southwest extremity of the town, is somewhat noted. There are a number of huts on the beach, which are occupied by persons engaged in the clam and oyster business. This point was formed and is preserved by the opposite action of the waters of Long Island sound, and of the Housatonic river. Oyster Huts on Milford Point. The above shows the appearance osthe oyster huts on Milford point. There is a street containing about 15 or 20 huts of this description, cov ered with sea weed, &c. which are quite novel in their appearance. About 50 or 60 persons, engaged in the oyster business, reside in these habitations during the winter months, and four or five have their fami lies with them. The rivers in this town are small. The Wepawaug, the largest, takes its rise in Woodbridge, 15 miles from its mouth, and runs through the center of the town. It furnishes a number of good mill seats. The others are the Indian river, Beaver river, the West End brook, and Stubby Plain brook, a branch osthe Indian river. Milford is now on the rise. There are many improvements making in this place, and others in contemplation. The number of inhabitants in the town, when the last census was taken, was 2,256, and has prob ably since increased to 2,800. There are at present in the town 400 houses, 480 freeholders, and 500 electors.* * For the preceding account of Milford, the author is indebted almost entirelv to Mr. Edward R. Lambert, of that place. Mr. Lambert contemplates publishing a'full and complete history of the town of Milford, from the first settlement to the present time. He has already made a considerable number of valuable and interesting col lections in reference to this object. \u00b0"], [253, "239 MILFORD. [From the Connecticut Journal, No. 482.] Milford, Jan. 8, 1777. Last Wednesday a flag of truce vessel arrived at Milford, from New York, after a tedious passage of several days, having on board upwards of 200 American prisoners, whose rueful countenances too well discover the ill treatment they received while prisoners in New York ; twenty of these unfortunate people died on the passage, and twenty have died since they landed at Milford.

The following is copied from an epitaph, in memory of a young woman who died in 1792, aged 24. The impression which her friends meant to convey was doubtless correct, but the words made use of, when applied to a human being, are rather unrefined, according to the taste of the present age. Molly, tho' pleasant in her day, Was sudd'nly seiz'd and sent away. How soon she's ripe, how soon she's rotten, Laid in the grave and soon forgott'n. In memory of Doctr.

NORTH HAVEN. NORTH BRANFORD, Was incorporated as a town in 1831. It was formed from the so cieties of North Branford aud Northsord, in the town of Branford. It is bounded north by Wallingsord, east by Guilford, south by Branford, and west by East Haven and North Haven. It is about five miles long from north to south, and averages upwards of sour miles in width. A range of mountains from southwest to northeast passes through the cen tral part of the town. The inhabitants are generally substantial farm ers, and property is very equally distributed. The face of the town ship is generally hilly, but the soil is strong and fertile. There are, it is believed, about 1000 or 1100 inhabitants. There are five houses of worship in this town, three for Congregationalists, and two for Epis copalians. The society of North Branford, the southern division of the town, was formerly called the village. The central part is five miles north of Branford church, and nine from New Haven. The Rev. Jonathan Merrick, the first minister in this parish, was ordained in 1727. Northsord society takes in a small part of Wallingsord. The Indian name of the place appears to have been Paug. The Congregational church is nine miles from New Haven. The post office is kept about a mile north, and may be considered as the center. The first clergyman was the Rev. Warham Williams, a grandson of the Rev. Mr. Williams of Deerfield, Massachusetts, who was carried captive by the Indians into Canada. The church here was called the third church in Bran ford. The first house of worship erected in this society is still standing, as is likewise the house of the first clergyman, (Mr. Williams,) which is now occupied by the Rev. Mr. Noyes, for a long period the minister of this parish, and who is considered to be one of the wealthiest cler gyman in the state. It is believed that Northsord, according to its population, has furnished more young men who have received a liberal education than any other town in the state. About a mile southeast of the Northsord church, on Tetoket moun tain, there is the appearance of having been, at some remote period, some violent convulsion in nature ; the rocks appear to have been rent asunder, and are thrown about in great disorder. Lead is said to have been found near this spot, a mass of it being discovered by a person who was hunting, at the time of the first settlement of the parish : he hung up a pair of buck's horns to designate the spot, but the place could not be found afterwards. NORTH HAVEN. North Haven was incorporated as a town in October, 17S6, being originally a part of the town of New Haven. It is bounded n. by Wallingsord, w. by Hamden, e. by Wallingsord and North Branford, and s. by East Haven. Its length from north to south is about six"], [255, "241 NORTH HAVEN. miles, and its medium breadth three. The town lies on both sides of the Wallingsoid or Quinnipiac river, and comprises the valley, and a part of the bordering hills. The valley is partly rich interval land, and more extensively sand ; covered with a thin stratum of loam ; light but warm. Near the northern line of the town it is so light as, in two or three places of small extent, to be blown into drifts. The soil of the hills is good, being a reddish loam. From the vicinity of this town to New Haven, and from its light and warm soil, which is favorable for early vegetation, there are various culinary vegetables, particularly peas, cultivated for the New Haven market. But the most striking feature in the township, is the large and beautiful tract of salt meadows on both sides of the Quinnipiac. These meadows produce large quantities of grass, which is mowed and stacked upon the land, from whence, when the ground is frozen suffi ciently solid in the winter, it is removed. Upon the salt marsh the hay is salt ; but on those meadows which are protected from the salt water by means of dikes, the grass is fresh and of a better quality. These are called dike marshes or meadows. The making of brick receives considerable attention in this town. Four and a half millions of brick are manufactured annually, and principally sold in New Haven. The first settler in North Haven appears to have been William Brad ley, who had been an officer in Cromwell's army. He lived here soon after the year 1650, on the land belonging to Gov. Eaton, who owned a large tract on the west side of the river. The next settlers were Thomas and Nathaniel Yale, who came here about the year 1660. The settlement of Wallingsord, or New Haven village, about the year 1670, encouraged the settlement of North Haven. Jonathan Tuttle began a settlement near the river; Nathaniel Thorpe, Ebenezer Blaks lee and John Humiston soon after settled on the eastern bank of the river, near the center of the town. Daniel and Thomas Barnes, Thom as Jacobs, and Moses Brockets, made settlements near the river, on the east side of it, about a mile north of the south line of the town. After this there came into the place families by the names of Clarke, Todd, Ives, Bishop, Cooper, Grannis, and Brockett. The settlement was very slow, and it seems that for nearly forty years some of the first planters attended public worship and buried their dead at New Haven. The women usually went on soot to New Haven, on the Lord's day, attended two long exercises, and returned. In some instances they did this with a child in their arms. \u2014 The Indians, (says Dr. Trumbull,) were sometimes very numerous in this place, and gave much alarm to the inhabitants, especially to the women and children. The Indians at Mattabeseck (Middletown) were connected with the Indians in this part of the state, and the extent of the river into the southern part of Farmington, and the fine fishing and fowling upon it, formed a connex ion with the Farmington Indians. The combination of these circum stances sometimes filled the parish with Indians. At particular times they seemed to swarm upon the river, and the groves and swamps ap peared alive with them. Once after the settlement commenced, they made a grand powwow, on the road between the corner of the market 31"], [256, "242 NORTH HAVEN. place and Mr. John Humiston's ; people were in great fear that their fields of corn would be ruined by them, but by the influence of the chief sachem, they were restrained from doing any damage. North Haven, (central part.) North Haven was made a parish in 1716, and the next year the Genera] Assembly gave the inhabitants liberty to form into a church ; the same year the Rev. James Wetmore was ordained their minister. At this time the limits of the parish extended considerably north and west of the meeting house in Mount Carmel parish in Hamden, and contained about forty families. \" Mr. Wetmore was greatly beloved and esteemed by his people ; but after he had labored with them for nearly sour years, he altered his sentiments, and in September, 1722, declared for Episcopacy. The consequence was a dismission, soon af ter, from his pastoral relation. He went to England, and took orders in 1723. He was rector of the church at Rye, where he died in 1660. He was educated at the collegiate school at Saybrook, where he re ceived the degree ofBachelor of Arts, in September, 1714. The Rev. Isaac Stiles succeeded Mr. Wetmore. He was ordained in November, 1724, and died May 14th, 1760, on the same day and nearly the same hour in which his predecessor, Mr. Wetmore, died. Mr. Stiles was succeeded, in 1760, by Dr. Trumbull, the historian of Connecticut. The Episcopalians in this place erected their first church in 1760. From 1762, till about the year 1783, they were under the pastoral care osthe Rev. Mr. Andrews of Wallingsord.\"* The above is a representation of the central part of North Haven; the Episcopal church with a Gothic tower is seen on the left.

The first meeting house in the town, thirty eight feet by forty, was erected on the same spot, about 1718. The Rev. James Pierpont gave the plat of ground on which it stood, upon condition that the people would erect a house of worship upon it. The drawing of the engraving was made a short time previous to the taking down osthe Congregational church. The steeple however was removed before the drawing was taken. Congregational Church, North Haven. A handsome Congregational church now stands a few rods westward osthe old meeting house. This church, and likewise that osthe Epis copal denomination, was erected in 1835 ; both are built of brick, of which considerable quantities are made in the town. The burying ground is seen in front of the Episcopal church. Dr. Trumbull was buried in this yard, nearly in front of his house. The following is the inscription on his monument. Here rest the remains of the Rev. Benjamin Trumbull, D. D. who was born at Hebron, Connecticut, A. D. 1735, and died February 2d, A. D. 1820, aged 85. He was graduated at Yale College, A. D. 1757, and ordained pastor in North Haven, A. D. 1760, in which relation he continued till his death; a period of almost sixty years. He composed during his ministry nearly four thousand sermons, and publish ed essays on the Inspiration osthe Scriptures, a History of Connecticut, a History of the United States, and other works, for which he was honored by his Alma Mater, and esteemed by his countrymen as an able Divine and an accurate Historian. Firm, humble, and devout, he sustained with dignity all his relations in life, and died a firm and joyful believer in his God and Saviour; anticipating with expressions of praise, the coming osthe Lord. Ezra Stiles, D. D. was a native of this town. He was the son of the Rev. Isaac Stiles, and was born November 29th, 1727. He was graduated at the seminary over which he was destined to preside, in 1746, and in 1749 was chosen tutor, in which station he remained six years. After having preached occasionally, his impaired health, and some doubt respecting the truth of Christianity, induced him to pursue the study of the law. In 1753, he took the attorney's oath at New"], [258, "244 NORTH HAVEN. Haven, and practiced at the bar till 1755. But having resumed preach ing, on the 22d of October in this latter year he was ordained minister of the second Congregational church in Newport, Rhode Island. In March, 1776, the events osthe war dispersed his congregation, and in duced him to remove to Dighton. He afterwards preached for some time at Portsmouth. In 1777, he was chosen president of Yale Col lege, as successor to Mr. Clap. He was not desirous of this honor, for he loved retirement ; but he was persuaded to accept it. He was installed July 8, 1778, and he continued in this station till his death, May 12, 1795, in the sixty eighth year of his age. Dr. Stiles was one of the most learned men, of whom this country can boast. He had a thorough knowledge of the Hebrew, Greek, and Lalin languages, the former ot' which he learned when he was about forty years of age; be had made considerable progress in the Samaritan, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic ; on the Persic and Coplic he had bestowed some attention ; and the French he read with great facility. He was also well versed in most branches of mathematical knowledge. Next to sacred litera ture, astronomy was his favorite science. He had read the works ofdivines in various languages, and very few have had so thorough an acquaintance with the fathers of the Christian church. He possessed an intimate acquaintance with the Rabbinical writings. He was a most impressive and eloquent preacher, for he spoke with that zeal and energy which the deepest interest in the most impoitant subjects cannot fail to in spire. His early discourses were philosophical and moral ; but he gradually became a serious and powerful preacher osthe momentous truths osthe gospel. In the room of labored disquisitions addressed rather to reason than to the conscience and heart, he employed his lime in preaching repentance and faith, Ihe great truths respecting our disease and cure, the physician of souls and our remedy in him, the manner in which the sinner is brought home to God in regeneration, justification, sanctification, and eternal gloiy, the terrors and blessings osthe world lo come, the influence osthe Holy Spirit and the efficacy of the truth in the great change of the character, preparatory for Heaven. The doctrines of the trinity in unity, of the divinity and atonement of Christ, wilh the capital principles of the great theological system of the doctrines of grace, he believed to have been the uninterrupted faith of eight tenths of Christendom from the ascension of Jesus Christ to the present day. This system, he observed to his flock, I have received from God in the scriptures of truth, and on the review of my ministry I hope you will find, that I have preached the unsearchable riches of Christ. He delighted in preaching the gospel to the poor. Among the members of his church at Newport were seven negroes. These occasionally met in his study, when he in structed them, and falling on their knees together he implored for them and for him self the blessing of that God, with whom all distinction excepting that of Christian excellence is as nothing. In the cause of civil and religious liberty, Dr. Stiles was an enthusiast. He contended, that the right of conscience and private judgment was unalienable ; and that no exigencies of the Christian church could render it lawful to erect any body of men into a standing judicatory over the churches. He engaged with zeal in the cause of his country. He thought, that the thirtieth of January, which was observed by the Episcopalians in commemoration of the martrydom of Charles I, \" ought to be celebrated as an anniversary thanksgiving, that one nation on earth had so much fortitude and public justice, as to make a royal tyrant bow lo the sovereignty of the people.\" He was catholic in his sentiments, for his heart was open to receive all who loved the Lord Jesus in sincerity. He was conspicuous for his be nevolence, as well as for his learning and piety. \" The following extracts from his diary furnish evidence of his Christian good ness. ' The review of my life astonishes me with a sense of my sins. May I be washed in the blood of Jesus, which cleanseth from all sin. Purify and sanctify me, O blessed Spirit !\u2014 I hope I love my Saviour for his divine excellencies, as well as for his love to sinners ; I glory in his divine righteousness ; and earnestly beseech the God of all grace to endue me with true and real holiness, and to make me like himself I have earnestly rmportuned the youth of this 'university to devote themselves to that divine Jesus, who hath loved them to the death. And praised be God, I have reason to hope that the blessed spirit hath wrought effectually on the hearts of sundry who have, I think, been brought home to God, and experienced what flesh and blood can not impart lo the human mind. Whether I shall ever get to heaven, and through many tribulations enter into rest, God only knows. This I know, that I am one osthe most unworthy of all the works of God.' Though in the first stage of his last sickness"], [259, "ORANGE. 245 he expressed awful apprehension of standing at the divine tribunal ; yet his hopes of heaven brightened as he approached the grave, and he departed in great calmness and peace. \" He was a man of low stature, and of a small though well proportioned form. His voice was clear and energetic. His countenance, especially in conversation, was ex pressive of benignity and mildness; but if occasion required, it became the index of majesty and authority. He published a funeral oration in Latin on Governor Law, 1751 ; a discourse on the Christian union, preached before the Congregational minis ters of Rhode Island, 1760; in this work he recommends harmony among differing Christians, and shows an intimate acquaintance with the ecclesiastical affairs of ihis country; a sermon at the installation of reverend Samuel Hopkins, 1770; a Latin oration on his induction into his office of president, 1778; the United States ele vated to glory and honor, an election sermon, preached May 8, 1783, which exhi bits the eloquence, and patriotism, and glowing sentiments of liberty, with which the august occasion could not fail to inspire him ; a sermon at the ordination of the reverend Henry Channing, at New London, 1787; history osthe three judges of King Charles I, Whalley, Goffe, and Dixwell, 12mo. 1795; in this work he discloses very fully his sentiments on civil liberty, and predicts \" a republican renovation,\" in Eng land. He lest an unfinished ecclesiastical history of New England, and more than forty volumes of manuscripts. An interesting account of his life was published by his son-in-law, the Rev. Dr. Holmes, in 1708.\"* The following is copied from the monument of Mr. Stiles, the father of President Stiles, in the grave yard in the center osthe place. This monument is erected to the memory of the Rev. Isaac Stiles, A. M., who was born in Windsor, July 30th, 1697, received a liberal education al Yale College; ordained to the pastoral office in the church of North Haven, November 11th, 1724, where he served in the ministry 36 years, and died May 14th, 1760, aged 63. Having a mind ennobled with sublime and venerable conceptions of the glories of the Most High, and the perfect order and happiness of the universe ; illuminated with Divine views of ihe economy of that part of it under the mediatorial dominion of Jesus Christ. Also being intimately acquainted with the sacred oracles, and having a natural gift of Elocution, he preached the gospel with fervor and fidelity. A friend to pure and undehled religion, with a charitable benevolence to all man kind. Mors Mihi vita Est. ORANGE. This town lies between New Haven and Milford, being bounded on the north by Derby and Woodbridge, on the east by New Haven, on the south by Long Island sound, and on the west by Milford. It is about 6 miles in length, and about 3J miles in breadth. The face of the township is hilly, and the soil productive. The inhabitants are generally farmers. It was incorporated by the General Assembly holden at New Haven in May, 1822, and was formed by the union of North Milford, a parish which belonged to Milford, with West Haven, a parish from New Haven. The first town meeting was held at the meeting house in the parish of North Milford, on the second Monday in June, of which meeting Charles H. Pond, Esq. of Milford, was pre viously appointed moderator by the Legislature. At this meeting Ben jamin L. Lambert, Esq. was appointed town clerk. The committee appointed by the two parishes to obtain the act of incorporation for a town, after having a variety of names under consid eration, finally adopted that of Orange, in commemoration osthe bene fits received from William, Prince of Orange, by Connecticut, when a * Allen's Biographical Dictionary."], [260, "246 ORANGE. colony ; particularly in the restoration of their charter privileges, after the tyranny and usurpation of Sir Edmund Andross. The central part of West Haven is three and a half miles from the court house in New Haven. The first clergyman in this parish was the Rev. Dr. Samuel Johnson, who was ordained in 1720. \" In October, 1722, he professed himself an Episcopalian, and left his people. He was missionary at Stratford many years ; afterwards president of New York College.\" \" The Rev. Jonathan Arnold was the second minis ter at West Haven, ordained 1725 or 1726. About the year 1734, he declared for Episcopacy. Having officiated as missionary at Derby and West Haven three or four years, he removed to Staten Island. The Rev. Timothy Allen, the third minister of West Haven, was or dained 1738, and dismissed 1742.\"* The Rev. Nathan Birdseye, the next pastor, was ordained in 1742 : he was succeeded by the Rev. Noah Williston, the fifth pastor, who was ordained in 1760. The Connecticut Missionary Society, an institution which has been of great and lasting advantage in a religious and moral point of view, had its ori gin in this society. A lady of this parish, (Miss Kimberly,) having had sour or five dollars presented to her by her brothers, who were seamen, gave it into the hands of her pastor, the Rev. Mr. Williston mentioned above, with a request that he would apply it for the purpose of supplying those that were destitute, with the preached gospel. Mr. Williston soon after attending the General Association, mentioned the gift and the object to his brethren, who, taking the subject into consid eration, formed the society above mentioned. West Haven green, the spot on which the Congregational and Epis copal churches are situated, is said formerly to have been marshy ground, and covered with alder bushes. It is now uncommonly plea sant in its appearance ; and, although the churches are rather antiquated in their appearance, there is an air of neatness and retirement about this spot that is seldom equalled. About a mile south of the green is Savin Rock, a place of some resort during the warm season of the year. It was at this place the British forces landed when they invaded New Haven in July, 1779. Adjutant Campbell was killed about one mile and a half north osthe churches; (see page 169.) A white hand kerchief, marked with his name, was long preserved as a relic, of this officer, and it is believed to be still in existence. He was possessed of an uncommonly fine personal appearance, and his death was much re gretted by the enemy ; but in the hurry and confusion of war, he was ieft behind, and his bloody remains were born to the grave on a sheep rack. Some of our people who were killed, were buried in the vicinity. Their bodies, however, were taken up by their friends, and re-interred in the places where they belonged. The land of North Milford part of the town was surveyed and laid out in 16S7, but was not settled till forty years afterwards. One Richard Bryan was the first who settled in that part of the town, and for many years it was called Bryan's Farm. At a town meeting in * Dr. Dana's Century Sermon."], [261, "OXFORD. 247 Milford, held on the 10th of December, 1750, it was \" voted that money should be appropriated to the inhabitants of Bryan's farm, for the purpose of setting up a school in winter, it being so well settled that one is deemed necessary.\" The inhabitants of North Milford attended meeting in Milford until 1805. They were incorporated as a society by the General Assembly, at their session in October, 1804. The number of petitioners for this incorporation was fifty. Their first regular society meeting was held December 3, 1804. The church was organized on Wednesday, March 13, 1805, and was begun by five persons dismissed from the churches in Milford. Their first pastor, Erastus Scranton, A. M., a native of Madison, was ordained July 4th, 1805. He preached with them for about twenty five years, when he asked dismission, and removed to Burlington. While he continued with them, the society greatly pros pered. The inhabitants of this parish, fourteen years before this, erected a meeting house, thirty six feet by thirty, on the green, where they had preaching in the winter season, by the alternate labors of the ministers of Milford. The present meeting house of this society was raised June 27th, 1810, and dedicated April 17, 1811. There is a silver mine in this parish, on land owned by John Lam bert, Esq., lying on the old country road. It was opened about twenty years ago, by Mr. David Lambert, the father of the present owner, who obtained a considerable quantity of ore, but having a large farm which required his attention, he did not long continue to work it. A valuable copper mine has lately been opened in the same range of rocks, by the New York Mining Company. It is said there are indi cations of coal in the north part of the town. Asbestos is abundant in the serpentine rocks, which abound in the southern section of the township. OXFORD. Oxford was incorporated as a town in October, 1798, previously to which time, it belonged to the town of Derby. The Rev. Jonathan Lyman appears to have been the first clergyman in the place. He was ordained in October, 1745. It is fourteen miles northwest from New Haven, and forty southwest from Hartford ; bounded north by Middle bury and Waterbury, on the southwest by the Housatonic, separating it from Newtown, on the west by Southbury, on the east by Bethany, and on the south by Derby. Its length from northeast to southwest is about eight miles, and its breadth nearly five. The surface of the township is uneven, being diversified with hills and valleys. The pre vailing soil is a gravelly loam ; the eastern and western parts of the town are generally fertile and productive. The central part, through which the main road passes, is considered to be the poorest land in the town. There are in the town three satinet factories, and an extensive hat manufactory, owned by Messrs. Hunt &. Crosby.

The above engraving is a southeastern view of the central part of Oxford. The building with a Gothic tower is the Episcopal church ; part of the Congregational church is seen on the extreme right. The elevation seen in the back-ground is called \" Governor's hill,\" so named, it is said, from its being principally owned, many years since, by a Mr. Bunnell, who was considered by bis neighbors as a lordly kind of a personage, and bad considerable to do with the law, being engaged in many law-suits for the support of his real or imaginary rights. From the important and consequential airs he assumed among his neighbors, he probably received the designation of \" Governor.\" Quaker Farms is a pleasant part of Oxford. It contains an Episco pal church, which is about two miles from the center of the town. About one mile and a half south from the center is the \" Park,\" former ly a place for deer. About eighty or ninety years since, a Mr. Wooster owned and enclosed about one hundred acres of land for the purpose of keeping deer. It is said that he had the exclusive privilege by law of restraining any person from hunting deer in the limits of\" the Park.\" Upon the outside of part of the enclosure there was a kind of pre cipice, from which the deer when pursued would sometimes leap into the enclosure, much to the mortification and disappointment of unpri vileged hunters. About one mile south of the central part of the town is a remarkable mineral spring ; called \" the Pool,\" from the circumstance of its waters being efficacious, and much used for the cure of the salt rheum and other complaints. \" Once in a month a yellowish scum will collect upon the surface of the water, which in a few days will run off, and1 leave the pool perfectly clear. In the coldest weather this spring neves freezes ; in the dryest season it is as full as at other times.\""], [263, "PROSPECT. 249 PROSPECT. Prospect was incorporated as a town in 1827. It was formerly the parish of Columbia, and was formed from the towns of Cheshire and Waterbury. It is^bounded north by Waterbury and Cheshire, east by Cheshire, south by Bethany, and west by Waterbury. It averages about five miles in length, and four in breadth. The central part is about seventeen miles from New Haven, and about four west of Chesh ire. The township is elevated and commands an extensive prospect, from which circumstance its name is derived. The surface of the town is hilly, mountainous, and stony. The inhabitants are principally farmers. There are two houses of worship, one Congregational and one Methodist. Some three or four years since, the Congregational clergyman and some osthe most influential members of the church and society adopted the sentiments of the Perfectionists, which caused some excitement in this and some of the neighboring towns. In New Haven county this doctrine appears to have originated with a student belonging to the the ological class in Yale College ; several of his associates in the institu tion also embraced the same sentiments, and from them it spread to some extent in several towns in Connecticut. A large proportion, how ever, of those who embraced the doctrines of the Perfectionists, have since altered their opinions, and have returned to their former belief. The following is believed to be a correct summary of the doctrines and opinions held by the Perfectionists. They divide mankind into three classes ; first, those who are entirely without a preparation of heart for the new birth, i. e. the unconverted ; second, those who are in a state of preparation, i. e. the converted; and third, those who have experienced the new birth, who are the only true children of God. For they say that \" conversion is merely re pentance towards God, \u2014 a mere change of the mind of the man.\" The new birth is a change in his moral nature \u2014 it gives him the nature of God ; mere conversion gives no security of salvation from either sin or hell ; but the new birth saves from both. \" For he that is born of God doth not commit sin, for his seed [the divine nature] remaineth in him and he cannot sin.\" This is the foundation on which they build. They believe that none are Christians, \" who are not entirely freed from sin, and who do not possess the faith, righteousness, liberty and glory of the risen Son of God. They believe that they are infallible, being under the peculiar guidance osthe Spirit, and give themselves up to be guided by him in the way of all truth, having, as they say, the will of the Lord made known to them by an immediate revela tion. They set aside all ordinances and holy days, such as baptism, the sacrament, with the Lord's prayer, and the observance of the Sab bath, &.c. ; saying that they are but the mere traditions of men, being no better than the forms and ceremonies osthe Popish church. Besides, they contend that all days are holy to them, \" having entered a Sab bath of eternal rest.\" They believe they are as secure in their state 32"], [264, "250 SOUTHBORT, of perfection as the angels of God, and that a man once having his feet firmly fixed upon this foundation is eternally secure, and may not give himself any more anxiety about his future destiny. They also believe that \" the history which the Bible contains of the church after Christ's ascension, commonly called the primitive church, is a history of the latter-day glory of Judaism, and not the commencement of Chris tianity, and that Christianity or the kingdom of heaven did not com mence until after the destruction of Jerusalem ;\" and that was the pe riod of Christ's second coming; and the resurrection, (the only one,) of the spiritual man from the power of sin and death, to endless glory and bliss. Therefore they say that the day of judgment is gone by in one sense, and in another is now going on and will be completed at the end of time. In the first view of the day of judgment as already passed, they say that this day, when spoken of in scripture, refers to the destruction of Jerusalem. In the second view of the subject, they contend that this day commences with the life of man, and ends with that life ; that immediately after death, the soul receives its final sen tence from the judge, and is never to be again summoned to appear be fore his bar. \" The salvation given to all men in Jesus Christ,\" say they, \" inclu ded nothing less than a perfect and eternal salvation from sin ; a perfect redemption from the law; a perfect resurrection of the spiritual body; and the standing on the plain ofeternity, beyond judgment.\" They be lieve that the disciples of Christ, during his ministry in the flesh, were not Christians. \" They call no man master, teacher, or chief, and will not be taught of each other, as they are all taught of God.\" They do not all hold to the same views. In the words of one of their num ber, \" they differ among themselves on almost all points, except the great distinguishing one, viz. perfection in holiness, \u2014 and these dif ferences they believe generally arise from the fact, that some are in advance of others in their Father's kingdom. SOUTHBURY. Southbury was formerly a part of the town of Woodbury, and was settled about the year 1672. It was incorporated as a distinct town in 1786, and at that period belonged to the county of Litchfield. It is bounded n. by Woodbury and Roxbury, s. w. bv the Housatonic river, separating it from Newtown, e. by Middlebu'ry, and s. e. by Oxford. Its average length from east to west is eight miles, and its average breadth about four. The prevailing soil is a sandy loam, gen erally warm and fertile. The Pomperaug, a considerable mill stream passes through the center of the town, and it is on the eastern side of this stream, that the principal village is situated : there is a fine tract of level land on its banks, though of small extent, as the ground rises at a short distance on both sides of the river : on the west side, nearly op posite the Congregational church, some traces of coal have been dis-"], [265, "SOUTHBURY. 251 covered. A shaft was sunk a few years since, to the depth of about 100 feet : some veins of coal were sound, but in such small quantities that it was deemed inexpedient to continue the search. Mitchell's Mansion House, Southbury. The above engraving is a south view of the Mansion House of M. S. Mitchell, Esq. recently erected, and designed as a house of public entertainment. It is about three quarters of a mile north of the Con gregational church. For beauty of situation and superior accommoda tions, it is not exceeded by any establishment of the kind in any country village in the State. This edifice stands on the spot where the house of the first minister of the place, Mr. Graham, formerly stood. The first meeting house ever built in the town was situated about 40 or 50 rods south. The central part of the village is 20 miles n. w. from New Haven, and 40 s. w. from Hartford. The village of South Britain, a parish in this town, is situated about four miles southwest from the central part osthe main village of South- bury. It is nearly surrounded by high hills and ledges, and the place viewed from the south has a romantic appearance. It is a thriving set- tlement, containing upwards of 20 dwelling houses, 2 churches, (1 Con- gregational and 1 Methodist,) 3 mercantile stores, 1 carpet manufactory and two or three hat manufactories. Some traces of coal have been found, near the soot of a ledge, in the immediate vicinity osthe village. The northern part of Southbury is called White Oak. This name was derived from an oak tree which formerly stood about half a mile west from the Congregational church, under which the first persons who explored the town encamped. There are two pieces of this tree remaining, one of which is in possession of Mr. Mitchell, the proprietor of the Mansion House in the village. These pieces were taken from the tree by Shadrach Osborn, Esq. an aged and respectable inhabitant of the town, on which is written by his hand the following :"], [266, "252 WALLINGFORD. \" This is a piece of the ancient white oak tree, taken from the trunk after it fell down, Aug. 19th, 1808, by Shadrach Osborn. \" The sturdy Oak, the boast of every clime, Must bow to the relentless hand oftime.\" \" The tree of which this is a part, stood about 80 rods east of the river, by the old field road, in a corner of the Mitchell land. The set tlers of the ancient town of Woodbury encamped under it when they first explored the town. It gave the name of White Oak to the north ern part of Southbury, and remained in a state of vegetation for a num ber of years after the limbs were broken off, and the body was in part decayed, and fell down in the year 1808. This piece was taken from the trunk Aug. 19th, the same year, by me. Shadrach Osborn.\" After the destruction osthe continental stores at Danbury during the Revolution, and while Mr. Osborn, mentioned above, was commissary, Southbury was made a place of deposit. Six or seven hundred barrels of pork were stored away in a place called Fox Hollow, and 50 men under the command of Capt. Parsons, of Derby, were appointed to guard it. A large group of chestnut trees have grown up since on the spot, which is about one mile southeast from the Congregational church. About a mile southwest, one or two hundred barrels of beef were stored, near the river. The first settlers located themselves back of the ancient burying ground, near the brook. The names of some osthe first were Judson ; Hinman, Curtis, Minor, Johnson and Strong. John Minor, it is said, was from Massachusetts, and acted as an interpreter with the Indians in the vicinity. In 1727, a great sickness prevailed here, and swept off almost all the old people : it is said to have been a kind of fever, and very fatal. The following inscriptions are on monuments in the old burying ground. In trust at best, \u2014 here lies the Revd- Mr. John Graham, who departed this life De cember ihe 11th, A. D. 1774, in the 81st year of his age and 54th year of his ministry. Andrew Graham, M. D. and a descendant of the Duke of Montrose, departed this for another and a better world, in June, 1785, aged 57 years. Out of respect to the memory of an honest man, this marble is placed by his son, John A. Graham LL D New York, 1805. Ne Oublie. WALLINGFORD. Wallingford originally belonged to New Haven, and before it was incorporated as a town was called New Haven village. The purchase osthe town was made by Governor Eaton, Mr. Davenport, and other planters of New Haven, in December, 1638. \" The settlement was projected in 1669. A committee was appointed by the town of New HaveD, vested with powers to manage the whole affairs of the settle ment. This committee held the land in trust, and acted in all the as-"], [267, "253 WALLINGFORD. fairs osthe town as trustees, until May, 1672, when they resigned their trust to the town. The Rev. Samuel Street was the first minister of the place. He commenced his labors here in 1672, and continued in the ministry in this town forty two years. The tradition is, that the Rev Mr. Davenport of New Haven, preached the first sermon in Wallingsord, at the bottom of the hill on which the town stands, from these words in Isaiah v. 1. \" My beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.\" Mr. Street moved here with his family in April, 1673 ; on the 15th of February, 1675, the town voted, \" that there had been consent about establishing a church of Christ in the aforesaid town, and a solemn day set apart and observed by the town unanimously, to seek God's guidance in so great a work ; they have now also actually and unanimously concluded, if it be the will of God, that there shall be a church gathered, and to walk according to the Congregational way ; and have also unani mously left the management of the same in the hands of Mr. Moss, Mr. Samuel Street, Mr. Brocket, Eliasaph Preston, John Hall, sen. John Hall, jun. Thomas Yale, Nehemiah Royce, Nathan Andrews, Benja min Lewis, Lieutenant Merriman, Sergeant Doolittle, John Beach ; that, if it be the will of God to incline their hearts, so many of them as may be a competent number for that work may, in his time, lay the founda tion.\" The church was, without much doubt, formed soon after. The first settlers assembled in a private dwelling, (the house of Lieut. Nathaniel Merriman,) for religious worship. In 1679, it was agreed to build a house 28 by 24 feet, and ten feet post. In 1681, a further rate was laid to finish the house, which however was not com pleted. In 1690, an addition of sixteen feet was made to the breadth of it ; and the following year \" concluded to seal the whole inside from sell to plate.\" The inhabitants had repeated apprehensions from the incursions of the Indians. On the breaking out of Philip's war in 1675, Mr. Street's and Lieut. Merriman's houses were ordered to be fortified, August 27th : the whole town engaged in the work till it was completed. Every man also was required to bring arms and ammunition on the Sabbath. The following October, Sergt. Doolittle's house at the lower end of the town, was fortified. Persons were appointed to keep garrison at each osthe above places.* In February, i690, there was an order of the town to fort in the meeting house. \" In 1702, the apprehensions from the savages were revived, and the inhabitants brought arms on the Lord's day.\" In 1690, the number of the inhabitants was 400, fami lies 73. Mr. Street died January, 1717, being 82 years old ; the Rev. Samuel Whittelsey, after preaching about a year, was ordained col league pastor with Mr. Street in 1710. At this time the number of in habitants was about 700. Mr. Whittelsey died in 1752, having almost completed the 42d year of his ministry. He was considered one of the most eminent preachers in the colony. Wallingsord is bounded north by Meriden, west by Cheshire, east by Durham and Middletown, and south by North Branford and North Ha- * Dr. Dana's Century Sermon."], [268, "254 WALLINGFORD. Wallingsord, (central part.) ven. Its length from east to west is nearly seven miles, and its breadth about six. The central part of Wallingsord is thirteen miles north from New Haven, twenty three south from Hartford, and between eleven and twelve miles southwest from Middletown. The prevailing surface is pleasantly diversified with moderate hills and dales ; the eastern extre mity of the township is mountainous. The soil is generally excellent, excepting a tract called the Wallingsord Plain, consisting of coarse sand, situated on the eastern bank osthe Quinnipiac. It is nearly sour miles in length, and about three fourths of a mile in breadth. It is the most extensive tract of level land in the state, and one of the most sterile and barren. The town is watered by the Quinnipiac, a valuable mill stream, which passes through the extent of the town, upon which are several mills and manufactories. Yaleville is a little manufacturing village in the northern section osthe town, where britannia and tin ware is manufactured to some extent. There is an establishment westward of the main street, on the Quinnipiac, for the manufacture of wood screws, of which there are about 1,000 groce manufactured daily. The principal village of Wallingsord is beautifully situated on a fine eleva tion upwards of a mile east osthe river, on two parallel streets extend ing along the ridge of the hill. The western street, on which the prin cipal part osthe village is situated, is upwards of a mile in length. The above is a representation of the central part of Wallingsord street. The view was taken looking north from the residence of Jared P. Whittelsey, Esq. a few rods south of the Congregational church. The building on the left is the Congregational church ; a short distance northward is seen the Baptist church, having a few poplars standing be fore it ; the large building on the opposite side of the street, without a steeple or chimney, is now occupied as an Episcopal church. These three churches are all the houses for public worship in the town."], [269, "255 WALLINGFORD. The house now occupied by the Episcopal society was built by a Congregational society in this town, known by the name of \" the \" Wells.\" This society owes its origin to the controversy which took place respecting the ordination of Dr. Dana, in 1758. Alter the death of Mr. Whittelsey, in 1752, the first society in Wallingsord were desti tute of a settled minister for about six years. At length Mr. James Dana, of Cambridge, Massachusetts became a candidate, and gave the majority of the society such satisfaction that they agreed to settle him. Some, however, were not satisfied with regard to his doctrines. A number of persons waited on Mr. Dana in order to ascertain his \"sen timents with regard to original sin, the saints' perseverance, free will, and falling from grace.\" He made them very short answers, and said he should not tell. They asked him how he liked the platform. He said he had never seen it, but supposed if he settled, he should settle upon it. They enquired if he had seen the doctrines of faith which Mr. Whittelsey had used ? He told them he had. They enquired how he liked them ? In reply he asked them, why they did not ask him how he liked John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, and \u00c6sop's Fables? This treatment, and his refusing to give an account of his doctrines, gave much dissatisfaction, and increased the party against him. A complaint was made against him to the consociation, which assembled in Wallingsord ; the ordaining council met at the same time. Mr. Dana and his adherents denied the jurisdiction of the consociation. The or daining council, who were in favor of Mr. Dana, separated from the consociation, and ordained him. The consociation adjourned, and in vited the neighboring consociation osthe southern district of the county of Hartford to unite with them in council. This united council de clared Mr. Dana and his church guilty of scandalous contempt, and it voted that \" the sentence of non-communion be declared against them.\" The minor part osthe church, who were opposed to Mr. Dana, were owned as a distinct church by the consociation. They were released from taxes to the support of Mr. Dana, by the General Assembly, in 1759, and allowed to worship by themselves. The Rev. Simon Wa terman was ordained pastor over them in October, 1761. The people were made a distinct society, by the name of Wells, in May, 1763. The number of church members in this society at the ordination of Mr. Waterman was sixty one. \" This controversy,\" says Dr. Trum bull, \" divided the town, alienated brethren, and effected divisions in the commonwealth and churches.\" At the time of the erection of the Wells meeting house, the parties came to blows, an attempt was made to stop the building, the bell was rung to call the party together, and the inhabitants, for a number of miles round, hastened to the scene of action and joined in the conflict. Lyman Hall, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, was a native of this town. He was graduated at Yale College in 1747. He at first made theology his study and profession ; but he afterwards studied medicine, went to Georgia, and established himself as a physi-"], [270, "256 WALLINGFORD. cian at Midway. He took an early and decided part in defense of colo nial rights, and was chosen a delegate to the general congress in 1775. Dr. Hall was afterwards governor of Georgia. During several of the late years of his life, he resided at his plantation near Savannah ; but towards the close of it he removed into one of the upper counties osthe state, where he died in 1790.* EXTRACTS FROM NEWSPAPERS. From the Connecticut Journal, April 29, 1768. As I have never burthened the public to read or you to publish any of my produc tions; I flatter myself the subsequent succinct suggestions will be forgiven. As econ omy is the watchword of the reign, as candor was of the former, in the courtly and ministerial style, it has crossed the Atlantic, and is in high vogue in America as well as Westminster, the city of the great king. The story is this,\u2014 A few days since, a strolling man in soldier's regimental garb, calling himself James McCannon, with a blazing woman, came into my house in early morn, begged for cider, then three mugs deep, as I was informed; after some admonitions given him, my affairs pressing my immediate departure, I left him in the house, on which he soon became very bois terous, attempted to pilfer some things which my domeslic discovered ; finally carried off a brass save-all, of a stand of candlesticks, (then undiscovered;) what else is at present unknown. This, though trifling in its value, intrinsically, but as an ancient patrimonial legac)r of high estimation, not only as a standing evidence of their pru dent economy, but ex vi termini a memento to economy save-all. And hereby I beg leave to give warning to all families to beware of such strolling pilferers, if they would save all. I beg leave also to ask the public, whether it would not be of public utility, to have task masters in every town to compel them to labor, as they are passing every day in our streets, and will be probably more and more ; or some other similar saluta ry measure. I ask pardon for one more hint which pops into my head, while my pen is moving, as a supplemental suggestion to economy and save-all. A respectable physician of the city of London, of high renown in the faculty, told the subscriber that he required his servants to save all the rags, not that it was of the least avail to him, but only a spe cimen of economy \u2014 save-all; and withall added, the rags in this city are worth sixty thousand pounds sterling a year. I hope the paper mill manufacturers, will not es teem the foregoing hint burthensome, though the public may what precedes.

At a meeting of a number osthe true sons of liberty in Wallingsord, in New Haven county, on the evening of the 13th day of January, 1766, after duly formed by choos ing a moderator and a clerk, the following resolves were come into, viz: Resolved, 1. That ihe late act of Parliament, called the Stamp Act, is unconstitu tional, and intended to enslave the true subjects of America. Resolved, 2.

It is 8 miles from north to south, and 4 from east to west. The town center is 20 miles from New Haven, and 28 from Hartford. With the exception of the alluvial lands upon the streams, the surface of the soil is hilly, rough, and of laborious cultivation. But although nature has been sparing of her gifts to constitute its inhabitants a great agricultural people, she has been profuse in the abundance of her water-falls ; and experience has proved that where these two interests are made to bear upon each other, enterprise alone is wanting to produce magnificent re sults. For thirty years previous to the introduction of manufactures into the community, the population rather decreased. The census of 1800, gave the number of 3,256\u2014 in 1810, of 2,784\u2014 In 1820, of 2,822 \u2014 in 1830, of 3,070 exclusive of about 350, which about that time were ceded to Prospect, when the parish of Columbia was added to form that township. The society of Salem yet remains a parish. The site upon which the borough of Waterbury stands, is situated in a valley which is washed by the Mad river on the east, and the Nau gatuc on the west ; and in its central part is about a mile in breadth. The main street runs east and west ; but since the increase of the man ufacturing establishments within the last twelve years, a large share of the new buildings have been erected in their vicinity, which is in the southeast part of the village. On either side of the village, hills gradu ally rise to a considerable elevation, presenting to the eye the galleries of an ampitheater, the village forming the area. The number of hou ses is about one hundred and fifty, and the population fifteen hundred ; which it is calculated has doubled itself during the last twelve years ; most of the factories having been established within that time. Some of the private dwellings may be called splendid, and a majority of them are neat and convenient, with handsome court yards in front. There are four churches in the place ; 1 for Congregationalists, 1 for Episco palians, 1 for Methodists, and 1 for the Baptist society. The last two have been recently built ; and are highly creditable to the congregations, considering the weakness of their numbers. The former two, as the societies are more numerous and able, will soon give place to edifices corresponding with the growth and prosperity of the place. The cut on the following page is a southeastern view of the central part of the village, and shows its appearance from the summit of a gen tle elevation, about five or six rods east from the road to New Haven. The Baptist church, with a square tower, is seen in the central part of the engraving ; the spire of the Episcopal church appears on the left, that of the Congregational church on the right. Of the articles manufactured in the village, those of gilt buttons, and the rolling of brass and copper metals for a great variety of uses, con stitute the greatest business. There are three factories of this kind upon an extensive scale, two in the village, aud one about two miles 33"], [272, "258 WATERBURY. Southeastern view of Waterbury, (central part.) north, connected with which is a gold refinery. There are likewise two factories of gilt buttons, upon a considerable scale, unconnected with rolling mills; one extensive rolling mill, connected with the brass wire and tubing manufacture ; two satinet factories, and one woolen factory ; besides a great number of minor establishments, in which buttons of va rious kinds, and other articles, are manufactured to a considerable ex tent. The number of persons in the village of both sexes, who are employed in the manufacturing establishments, is between six and seven hundred. It is not known precisely what amount is manufactured yearly, but it has been estimated by good judges to exceed a million of dollars, and is upon the increase. The route has been surveyed by a practical engineer, for constructing a canal to bring the Naugatuc on to the bank at the west end of the town, which will, when completed, afford a sup ply of water power, capable of employing as much or more capital than has been already invested. In consequence of the favorable reports relative to the interval lands bordering upon the river Naugatuc, in this vicinity, a number of the in habitants of Farmington, in the autumn of 1673, petitioned the As sembly for a committee to view Mattatuck, (the aboriginal name of Waterbury,) and report upon the expediency of locating a plantation at that place. A committee, consisting of Lieut. Thomas Bull, Lieut. Robert Webster, and Daniel Pratt, was appointed, who reported to the Assembly in May, 1674, that Mattatuck would probably afford suffi cient means to sustain a population of thirty families. Upon the re ception of this report, a committee of five, consisting of John Talcot, Robert Webster, Nicholas Olmsted, Samuel Steele, and John Wads worth, were appointed to manage and order the affairs of the settle ment. This committee entered immediately upon their duties, and drew up a plan to regulate and establish the settlement, which docu ment consisted of eight articles, bearing date the 30th day of May, 1674, in the following words :"], [273, "259 WATERBURY. Article I. \u2014 Every person lhat is accepted for an inhabitant shall have eight acres for a home lot. Article II.\u2014 The distribution of meadows shall be proportioned to each person ac cording to estate \u2014 no person lo have exceeding \u00a3100 allotment, excepting two or three allotments, which the committee may make according to their best discretion. Article III. \u2014 Taxes lor public charges to be according to meadow allotments, this article to be in force five years \u2014 at the end of five years rates to be on polls and estate, according to the law of the colony. Article IV. \u2014 Every person that takes up an allotment, shall, within four years after the date hereof, build a good and fashionable dwelling house, 18 by 16, anil 9 feet be tween joints, with a good chimney. Article V. \u2014 In case any person shall fail of building as aforesaid, he shall forfeit all his allotments at Mattatuck, and all his right and title, buildings only excepted, to be disposed of by the committee to others, who shall be accepted according to the condi tion of these articles. Article VI. \u2014 All who have allotments, shall personally dwell as inhabitants of Mat tatuck, or forfeit as aforesaid. Article VII. \u2014 Each person who has an allotment at Mattatuck, shall dwell there four years from the time he enters upon dwelling there, or forfeit as aforesaid. Article VIII. \u2014 All who shall have allotments shall sign these articles.

Edmund Scott, jr. Joseph Gaylord, John Hopkins, Timothy Stanley, and Thomas Warner. Thus, the propriety or ownership of the town, was by the commit tee divided into an indefinite number of shares, leaving it optional with the settler to subscribe for any portion, not exceeding one hundred pounds \u2014 the committee reserving to themselves the right to make two or three special allotments of one hundred and fifty pounds each. These reserved rights were subsequently appropriated \u2014 one of \u00a3150 value for the benefit of the ministry, and another of equal amount for the use of schools. In the summer of 1674, the committee purchased of the native In dians (in trust for the settlement) by deed, bearing date August 21st, for the consideration of divers good causes, and thirty eight pounds, a tract of land at Mattatuck, bordering upon both sides of the Naugatuc river, ten miles long from north to south, and six miles wide from east to west; butting east on Farmington, south on Paugasset, (now Der by,) west on Paugasset, Pomperaug and Potatunk, (now Woodbury and Southbury,) and north on wilderness. The breaking out of what was called King Philip's war, in 1675, and the distresses attendant upon it,"], [274, "260 WATERBURY. for a time retarded the designs of the settlers ; little else being done than exploring the country. After peace was established with the In dians, the subscribers to the articles determined upon settling Mattatuck without delay. Accordingly, in 1677, the State's committee assigned their purchase of the Indians to Thomas Judd, John Stanley, and oth ers, inhabitants of Mattatuck, and in the January following, made reg ulations about the fences around the meadows on the east side of the river, and ordered the work to be finished by the last of May succeed ing. It was at this time that those signers designated in the preceding note declined joining the settlement, and the other individuals were ad mitted in their stead. The committee likewise extended to the sub scribers one year more than the articles originally allowed, in which to erect their dwellings in Mattatuck. In 1684, the Indian owners of the town, for the consideration of di vers good causes, and \u00a39, conveyed to the English proprietors a parcel of land to run eight miles north from Mount Taylor, to extend west to a north and south line eighty rods east of Quassapaug pond, butted north on wilderness, east on Farmington bounds, south on the former grant, and west on the aforementioned north and south line. In De cember of the same year, a number of Indians conveyed to said pro prietors a number of pieces of land lying within the bounds described within the deed of 1674, probably other claimants to the same lands. Thus the ancient limits to the town of Waterbury, as deeded by the Indians, and patented by the State to the proprietors, extended about eighteen miles from north to south, and about ten from east to west \u2014 now comprehending the towns of Waterbury, Watertown, and Ply mouth, most of Middlebury, half of Wolcott, and a small part of Ox ford and Prospect. This extent of territory, which was estimated by a committee of the Assembly as capable of accommodating thirty fam ilies, now contains a population of about eight thousand souls. In the summer of 1677, the proprietors, without their families, came on to their purchase to lay out the foundation of the suture capital of their little colony. The site first pitched upon was on the ridge of a considerable eminence, which ascends from the western bank of the Naugatuc, about a mile from the present location of Waterbury village, and which to this day is called \" Town Plot.\" Streets were laid out, (nearly as they now remain,) and building lots of eight acres each were apportioned to each settler, agreeable to the original articles of agree ment. But before any buildings were erected on the spot, considera tions both of expedience and safety induced a change from their primi tive design. The disastrous events of King Philip's war admonished them of the necessity of maintaining a ready communication with their friends and allies at Farmington, and other eastern settlements ; and as the Naugatuc was subject to frequent inundations, this intercourse would consequently be cut off should they be attacked by a savage foe during flood time. And as the produce from the meadow, which was chiefly to constitute their suture means of support, must be attended with great labor and inconvenience in its transportation up so long and steep an ascent, this consideration likewise had no slight influence in turning the"], [275, "261 WATERBURY. scale in favor of a location in the valley. A few temporary huts were therefore erected for the season, on the east bank of the Naugatuc, near \" Sled Hall ;\" and the following year (1678) streets were laid out, and dwellings erected upon the present site, with a view to a permanent set tlement. House lots of from one and a half to sour acres were set off to each individual, according to eligibility of situation, and extent of proprietors' rights. In the latter part of the year some of the settlers moved their wives and families into their new habitations. The first English child born in Waterbury was Rebecca, daughter of Thomas and Mary Richardson, April 27, 1679, in a house which stood upon the site of the old \" Judd House,\" well known as a tavern stand for more than half a century, having been kept by Capt. Samuel Judd, previous to the Revolutionary war, until his death, in September, 1825, in the 9lst year of his age. The house was destroyed by fire on the 25th day of February, 1833, in which a young man named John N. Tuttle, and two daughters of Mr. Israel Holmes, perished in the flames.* An other house has been erected over the ruins, and is now occupied by Mr. Samuel J. Holmes, an elder brother of the aforementioned \u2014 grand son of Captain Judd, and lineal descendant from Thomas Judd, one of the original settlers. The first English male child born in the settle ment, was Richard, son of John and Mary Welton, Sept. 27, 1679, in a house nearly opposite the old Judd house, upon the spot where now stands the house of Mr. Giles Ives. Among their early privations, the settlers suffered greatly for want of a grist mill. Their only resource was by carrying their bread corn to Farmington to be ground, a distance of twenty miles, and through a pathless wilderness. The State's committee, as early as November, 1679, took the subject into consideration, and not only recommended its erection, but granted 30 acres of land to whoever should build and keep up the mill. In 1680, Stephen Hopkins, of Hartford, built a mill on Mill river, (now Mad river,) where a mill has stood to the present time. Some other allotments were afterwards made by the proprie tors ; but like many grants for public purposes, made with laudable in tentions, posterity are prone to disregard. Antecedent to February, 1681, the concerns of the town were di rected by the State's committee, at which time they ordered that the inhabitants might elect their own townsmen constables, haywards, sur- * To evince the deep sympathy which was felt upon this melancholy occasion, a handsome obelisk monument has been erected over the ashes of the victims, wilh the following inscriptions: On the west front \u2014 \" Beneath this stone rests the remains of John N.

In 1682, the committee fur ther extended to the settlers the power to regulate the impounding of cattle. From that period to 1686, at which date Mattatuck was incor porated under the name of Waterbury, the committee appear to have had little to do with its concerns. Waterbury was represented for the first time, by Ensign Thomas Judd, in May, 1689. Lieut. John Stanley was chosen the second representative, the May following. At that time the taxable polls of the town, including all males from 16 to 70 years of age, were thirty seven. The town list was \u00a31,893, nor did it increase until 1701. During the first ten years after their settlement, the inhabitants were deprived from hearing the gospel regularly preached. In 1689, the Rev. Jeremiah Peck, senr. of Greenwich, was unanimously invited by the residents to settle with them in the ministry ; and as inducements, they voted him the house and lot which they had already provided for a minister, a propriety of \u00a3150, and the full benefit of all the divisions which had been granted therein. A salary of \u00a360 per annum was also voted him, fifty of which was to be paid in provisions and ten in wood. Mr. Peck accepted the call, and continued his official duties until a short period before his death, which occurred in June, 1699. at the age of 77 years. Mr. John Jones officiated for a short time during his decline, and subsequently Mr. John Reed preached occasionally \u2014 was invited to settle, but declined. In the latter part osthe year 1699, Mr. John Southmayd, of Middletown, was invited to take charge of the congregation, but on account of the Indian disturbances at this pe riod, and the deranged condition osthe town, he was not ordained until May, 1705. At the time of the settlement of Mr. Peck, the number of families was thirty, and about one hundred and fifty inhabitants, 7 of whom (males) were members osthe church. The number of mem bers had now increased to 12, but the number of inhabitants remained about the same. The salary granted to Mr. Southmayd was \u00a360 a year, fifty payable in provisions and ten in wood, at the following rates ; wheat 5s., rye 3s., corn 2s. 6d. per bushel, and pork 3d. per pound ; with this proviso, that those who paid in money should have a deduc tion of one third \u2014 this reducing the salary to \u00a340. Rev. Mark Leav enworth, succeeded Mr. Southmayd. He was ordained in 1740, and died in 1797, at the age of 86 years, and in the 58th year of his minis try. When the simplicity of manners which prevailed at that period is taken into consideration, the gloomy circumstances of the country, and the number and abilities of the inhabitants, the salaries of the two first clergymen in Waterbury were much larger than those paid at the pres ent day. The first house for public worship erected in Waterbury, stood upon the site recently occupied by the Congregational meeting house. It was a small building, and continued without gallery or glazing until 1716, when the sum of \u00a315 was appropriated for its completion. The con gregation assembled there until 1726, when the town voted to build a new house, 50 feet by 40. Lieut. John Hopkins, Sergt. John Scovil, Isaac Bronson, deacon Thomas Hickox, and Thomas Clark, were ap-"], [277, "263 WATERBURY. pointed a committee to superintend its erection. This was indeed a great undertaking ; for tradition says that at the time the house was commenced, all the inhabitants osthe town, men, women and children, might have been seated upon its sills. By extraordinary exertions funds were raised by donations, contributions, fkc. so that the house was in such a state of forwardness that the congregation were seated in 1729 \u2014 the gallery was finished the following year, which completed an object so dear to the hearts of our worthy forefathers. Liberal grants in lands were from time to time made by the State's committee, in conjunction with the original proprietors of the town, to provide for the preaching of the gospel and the establishment and main tenance of elementary schools, amply adequate, it is believed, had the property been discreetly managed by their descendants, to have defray ed to this day the salaries of the ministers, and the expenses of the common schools throughout the town. But after the town was cut up into different societies,* a diversity of interests was created ; the lands were mostly sold, the payments became the sources of wearisome liti gation, and a change of times, added to occasional bankruptcies of debtors, swallowed up the avails, thereby defeating the praiseworthy in tentions of our ancestors. As an example osthe solicitude entertained by the original settlers upon the subject of education, and which like wise lays open their embarrassed circumstances, the town, in 1698, \" Voted, to set up a school sour months or more, and the committee are to endeavor to get a schoolmaster to teach writing as well as reading.\" Until the peace with the French and Indians in 1713, the dwellings of the inhabitants were restricted to the town center ; the men going into the meadows and places adjacent to labor during the day, and re turning to their families at night. The menacing attitude of the Indians kept the settlement in a perpetual state of alarm. Two or more of the citizens were ordered by the government of the State to act in rotation daily, as scouts to make discoveries and prevent surprise. Sentinels were also placed upon the high grounds in the vicinity to watch for the safety of the people. About the year 1707, a small party of Indians made a descent from the north to make reprisals from the English. As cending a high hill opposite Mount Taylor to make discoveries, they espied one Jonathan Scott and his two sons in Handcock's Meadow. The old gentleman was seated under an oak tree near the bank of the river, eating his dinner, his sons a little distance from him. The In dians approached the whole unperceived, and took Mr. Scott by sur- prise ; the boys got off out of the way. But by threatening the life of the father unless he recalled his sons, he reluctantly obeyed, when they were all three secured and taken to Canada. Mr. Scott and his eldest son, Jonathan, were afterwards redeemed and returned home ; but the youngest became attached to the Indians and refused to return. To prevent Mr. Scott from escaping or offering resistance, they took off his right thumb. Another attack was made by the Indians, in 1710, * The society of Westbury (now Watertown) was made a separate society in 1739 , Northbury (now Plymouth) in 1740; Middlebury, about 1790."], [278, "264 WATERBURY. upon the inhabitants of Waterbury and Simsbury, in which an inhabit ant of the former by the name of Holt, was killed on Mount Toby, and several people of the latter. As early as April, 1700, the town voted to fortify Ensign Timothy Stanley's house, which stood a little west of the academy ; men and boys, with teams \u2014 all who were able to work, to go about it the next day. And in June, 1707, the town, considering the troubles and fears arising from the hostile disposition of the enemy, agreed to lay aside cutting bushes till after Michaelmas, and go about finishing and repairing the forts. In 1708, the State gave the town \u00a315 towards aiding in the construction of forts ; and the town agreed to build three forts, two at the expense of the State, and one at its own. The houses of Lieut. Timothy Stanley, John Hopkins and Mr. South mayd were designated for that purpose. They were accordingly forti fied by stockades, or timbers set up endwise firmly in the ground, with an opening for a gate, to pass and repass. Frail as was this defense to any enemy but a savage, the inhabitants for years were glad to avail themselves of the nightly protection which these feeble fortifications afforded. These perpetual troubles, and the necessity of a constant system of military discipline, made our forefathers a martial people, and even the humblest of military honors were held in high estima tion. The highest military dignitary known among them, was that of lieutenant ; but great deference was paid to sergeants \u2014 hence the early records abound with titles of that grade. Their descendants may smile at the simplicity of their ancestors, but the same circumstances combin ed would probably produce precisely the same effects upon their own minds. In times of war, danger and distress, honors are awarded by the people to those whom they think possess ability and integrity, and honors which are conferred with such motives, carry with them some thing more than empty names. The drum was then an important in strument ; it sounded the alarm in time of danger ; it summoned the inhabitants to the fortified houses at night, and roused them from their slumbers in the morning. It also gave the signal for firing the woods to increase the food for the cattle, and to call the inhabitants to their de votions upon the Sabbath. Besides the Indian wars, and the ordinary difficulties which attend all new settlements, the inhabitants were visited by two calamities du ring the first thirty five years, unparalleled in the subsequent history of the town. In February, 1691, the alluvial lands bordering upon the Naugatuc, upon which was their chief dependence, were almost ruined by a flood. The river, by rains and melting of the snows, rose to a prodigious height, far beyond any instance of the kind since known, washing away the soil in many places, and covering the remainder with gravel and stones to a degree which rendered it unfit for imme diate use. The weather had been previously warm, the frost came out of the ground, leaving the arable part an easy prey to the raging ele ment. This untoward misfortune had so depressing an effect upon the inhabitants that many were discouraged, and abandoned their posses sions forever. The consequence was, that in 1709, the population va ried but little from that of 1691, eighteen years before. The Wads-"], [279, "265 WATERBURY. worth manuscript says, that in 1694 \" Waterbury was a small town, though very compact. It contained twenty five families.\" In October, 1712, the town was visited by a great and mortal sickness, which raged without abatement, until September, 1713. During its prevalence, the number of well persons was insufficient to provide for and attend the sick , and to bury the dead. About thirty individuals died of the fever, and this out of a population of about two hundred. To the research of a gentleman who is himself a descendant by both parents from two of the original families, we are indebted for the data which form the basis of the foregoing history of the rise and pro gress osthe town of Waterbury during the first forty years. The popu lation at that period was probably about three hundred. In the notes before us, this antiquarian observes : \" During the last thirty years, the inhabitants maintained among them a constantly preached gospel ; and although surrounded with difficulties, dangers, and misfortunes, and deprived of all the conveniences and most of the comforts of life, (agreeable to our present ideas,) yet they persevered, and we are now reaping the harvest of their labors. To their honor be it said that our ancestors would not suffer in a comparison drawn between them and their posterity. They were moral, religious, industrious and resolute. Under their circumstances little progress could be made in literature ; but they were calculated to elicit more thought, and more exertion, both of body and mind, and those qualities combined make the man.\" Samuel Hopkins, D. D. an eminent divine, was born in this town Sept. 17th, 1721. \" He lived with his parents, employed in the labors of agriculture, until he entered his fifteenth year ; and such was the purity of manners among the youth of this place, that he never heard from any of them a profane expression. After having been placed for a short time under the tuition of the Rev. John Graham of Woodbury, he entered Yale College in September, 1737, and was graduated in 1741. While a member of this institution he made a public profession of religion.\" \"After he was graduated in September, 1741, he retired to his father's house, and lived a recluse for a number of months, except when he could hold intercourse with persons zealous in religion. In December he went to Northampton, Massachusetts, to pursue the study of divinity with Mr. Edwards, and while with him was led to con sider the proper effects and evidences of that renovation of soul, which he believed lo be necessary in order to receive the blessings of the gospel, and for the first time be came satisfied that he was a Christian. After he was licensed to preach in May, 1742, he still continued at Northampton, engaged in his theological studies, preaching occasionally, without any pecuniary compensation, in the neighboring towns. From December of this year till May, 1743, he preached to a new society in Simsbury, Con necticut. In July he went to Housatonnoc, now Great Barringlon, Mass., where he was ordained Dec. 28, 1743. At this time there were only thirty families in the place. Here he continued till Jan. 18, 1769, when he was dismissed by an ecclesiastical coun cil. This event was occasioned by the diminution of his society and Ihe want of sup port. An Episcopal church had been established in the town in order to escape the tax for the maintenance of a minister of the gospel. Mr. Hopkins was again settled in the ministry at Newport, Rhode Island, April 11, 1770.\" \" The war of the Revolution interrupted his benevolent labors. In Dec. 1776, when the British took possession of Newport, he left the town, and retired to his family, which he had before sent to* Great Barrington. During the summer of 1777 he preached at Newburyport, to a congregation which was thought to be the largest in America. 31"], [280, "266 WATERBURY. Its pastor, the Rev. Mr. Parsons, died a short lime before. He afterwards labored in the gospel of Jesus Christ in Canterbury and Stamford, Connecticut. In the spring ol 1780 he returned to Newport, which had been evacuated by the British in the faH ot the preceding year. He found his church and congregation much diminished. I he town had been so long in the hands of the enemy, that many, who had removed, had become established in other places, and were thus prevented from returning. The meeting house had been made a barrack for soldiers, and had been much injured, and the bell had been carried away. That portion of his former society, which had re mained in the town, had become so impoverished, that he had no prospect of a main tenance. Yet such was his benevolence, that he preached to them a year, supported entirely by a few generous friends, and when he received a pressing invitation to set tle at Middleborough, the request of his people induced him to decline it. From this time till his death his maintenance was derived entirely from a weekly contribution and the donations of his friends. But he was contented with his humble circumstan ces, and in a situation, which would have filled most minds with the greatest anxiety, he cast himself upon the providence of God, and experienced through a course .of years many remarkable interpositions in his favor. His wants were always supplied. On the 10th of January, 1799, a paralytic affection deprived him of the use of his limbs, although his mental powers were uninjured. But he afterwards recovered from this attack, so as to be able to preach. He died December 20, 1803, in the eighty third year of his age.\" \" Dr. Hopkins was a distinguished divine. His mind was discerning, and his ap- Dlication was almost unequalled. He sometimes devoted to his studies eighteen hours in a day. With respect to his views of divine truth, he embraced the Calvinistic doe trines; and it is principally by the consequences which he drew from these doetrines, that his name has been rendered famous. He fully admitted the Calvinistic doctrine osthe entire depravity of the human heart and the sinfulness of all the doings of the unregenerate; but his discerning mind perceived the discordance between thisdoctrine and the preaching of some osthe Calvinistic divines, who exhorted the unregenerate as such to perform certain acts as the appointed way to obtain that grace, which should renew their hearts and make them holy. If men before conversion could do nothing lhat was pleasing to God, he concluded they could do nothing to procure the influ ences of the Holy Spirit. Instead therefore of exhorting sinners to use the means of grace in order to obtain the divine assistance to enable them to repent, when it was ac knowledged that in the use of the means of grace they would be entirely sinful, he thought it a sacred duty, incumbent on the ministers of the gospel, to imitate the preaching of the Lord Jesus, their Master, and lo call upon men immediately to re pent and yield themselves to the love of God. He thought that religious advantages, if in the use of them the unregenerate were not converted, would but increase guilt, as in this case there would be a greater resistance to the truth. Another sentiment, which is considered as one of the peculiar sentiments of Dr. Hopkins, is that the ina bility of sinners is moral and not natural ; but this is only saying, that their inability consists in disinclination of heart or opposition of will to what is good. Combining the Calvinistic doctrine, lhat God has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass, with his views of the nature of sin as consisting entirely in the intention or disposition of the mind, he inferred, that it was no impeachment upon the character of the most right eous Disposer of all events to say, not merely that he decreed the existence of sin, but that he exerted his own power to produce it. The design being benevolent, he con tended that no more iniquity could be attached to this act, than to the bare permission of sin. This is another of his peculiarities. From his views of the nature of holi ness, as consisling in disinterested benevolence, he also inferred, that a Christian should be willing to perish for ever, to be for ever miserable, if it should be necessary for the glory of God and th\u00ab good of the universe, that he should encounter this destruc tion. Instead of the Calvinistic doctrine of the strict imputation of Adam's sin and of the righteousness of Christ, he chose rather to adopt the language of scripture in say ing, that on aacount of the first transgression men were made or constituted sinners, and that men are justified on account of the righteousness of Christ, or through the re demption, which there is in him. \" Dr. Hopkins published three sermons, entiiled, Sin through divine interposition an advantage to the universe, and yet this no excuse for sin or encouragement to it 1759 the second edition of which was published in Boston in 1773, and another edition'abont the same lime in Edinburgh ; an inquiry concerning the promises of the gospel wheth er any of them are made to the exercises and doings of persons in an unregenerate state, containing remarks on two sermons by Dr. Mayhew, 1765; a sermon on the di vinity of Christ, preached in Boston, 1768 ; two sermons on Romans vii. 7, and John i 13, 1768, republished 1793 ; the true state and character of the unregenerate strirmed' of all misrepresentation and disguise, being an answer to the reverend Mr Mills 1769; animadversions on Mr. Hart's late dialogue, 1770; an inquiry into the nature"], [281, "267 WATERBURY. os true holiness, with an appendix in answer to Drs.

He left behind him sketches of his life written by himself, a dia logue on the nature and extent of true Christian submission, and an address to pro fessing Christians, all of which were published by the reverend Dr. Weat of Stock bridge in 1805.\"* Dr. Lemuel Hopkins, a physician and poet, was born in this town June 19th, 1750. \" His father was a farmer in easy circumstances, and while he reared all his children to the labor of the field, took care to bestow upon them a good education. Dr. Hopkins is said to have been determined to the study of physic when young, by observing the gradual decline of some of his connexions, who were sinking under a consumption. This inclination to medical pursuits was strengthened by the circumstance of an hereditary predisposition to the same disorder which existed in the family. His education, it seems, had not been classical, and having resolved upon the medical profession, he applied himself to Latin and other preliminary studies, and after proper qualifi cation, placed himself under the care of a physician in Wallingsord. He began regular practice in Litchfield, about the year 1776, and was for a short time in the American army as a volunteer. About 1784, he removed to Hartford. Here he passed the rest of his life, devoted to the labors of a physician and man of letters. He fell a victim, we are told, to the exercise of an improper remedy in his own case, occa sioned by his dread of a pulmonary complaint. He died on the 14th of April, 1801. \" Dr. Hopkins was a physician of great skill and reputation. His memory was so retentive, that he would quote every writer he had read, whether medical or literary, with the same readiness that a clergyman quotes the Bible. In his labors for scientific purposes, he was indefati gable. The Medical Society of Connecticut is indebted to him as one of its sounders. In his person, he was tall, lean, stooping and long limbed, with large features and light eyes, and this uncouth appearance, added to a great eccentricity of manner, rendered him at first sight a very striking spectacle.\"! In his literary character he was eminent among the distinguished writers of the place where the most of his life was spent. Trumbull, Barlow, Humphreys, Dwight, and others, were his associates, and the first two, with Hopkins, wrote the Anarchiad. He also had a hand in The Echo, The Political Greenhouse, and many satirical poems of that description, in which he had for his associates, Richard Alsop, Theodore Dwight, and a number of others. Besides these, there are a few short pieces which were written by him exclusively ; among which is his Epitaph on a patient killed by a cancer quack. * Allen's American Biographical Dictionary. t Kettell's American Poetry."], [282, "268 WOLCOTT.

Wolcott is a small elevated township, situated in the northern ex tremity of the county, bounded n. by Plymouth and Bristol, e. by Southington, s. by Cheshire and Waterbury, and w. by Waterbury and Plymouth. It averages about six miles in length, and has an ave rage breadth of about three miles. \" The township is hilly and moun tainous, and is situated in the vicinity of the commencement of the granitic district, which extends through the western section osthe state, and comprises a considerable portion of Litchfield County. About lj miles n. e. osthe meeting house, there is a hill, which is the most ele vated land in this part of the state ; Long Island sound, the mountain east of Somers, and some part of the state of Massachusetts, can be seen from this spot. The soil is a hard, coarse, gravelly loam, and rather sterile : the lands however afford tolerable grazing, but are rough and stony. There are two houses of worship, 1 for Congregationalists, and 1 for Episcopalians. The number of inhabitants in 1810 was 952; in 1830, it was reduced to 843. Wolcott was incorporated as a town in 1796. It was formed from a part osthe original town of Farmington and a part of Waterbury. It was from this circumstance that the place was formerly called Farming bury. The first clergyman was the Rev. Alexander Gillet: he was succeeded by the Rev. Israel B. Woodward. Mr. Woodward, though"], [283, "269 WOODBRIDGE. somewhat eccentric in some part of his conduct, was a person of supe rior intelligence and esteemed by his parishioners. A thanksgiving sermon of his is recollected, in which he compares the state of Connec ticut to the land of Canaan. In one respect, he mentioned, there was a striking similarity ; the land of Canaan was rocky, this was very much the case with Connecticut, at least with that part of it in which Wolcott was situated. WOODBRIDGE. Woodbridge was incorporated as a town in 1784. It was original ly a parish by the name of Amity, which was formed from the towns of New Haven and Milford. It is bounded n. by Bethany, e. by Hamden, s. by New Haven and Orange, and w. by Derby. Its ave rage length is about five miles, and its breadth about sour. The soil is a hard gravelly loam, and affords good grazing ; and large quantities of butter are made in this town for the New Haven market. The princi pal stream is the West river, which runs on the west side of the West Rock, a range of mountains on the eastern border of this town. The central part of the town is about six miles from New Haven. Amity was constituted a parish in 1739. The town was named from the Rev. Benjamin Woodbridge, the first clergyman, who was ordained here in 1742. The house in which he lived is still standing, and is about 100 rods southeast from the Congregational church, now occupied by the widow and children of Mr. Daniel T. Smith. Mr. Woodbridge presented the town with a copy of Whitby's Commentary on the New Testemetit, in gratitude for the honor done him in naming the town. It is said that Mrs. Woodbridge, his wife, was the first person who in troduced the use of tea into the place. This town has a fund of about five thousand dollars, given by Mr. Stephen Sansord, who it appears was a firm friend to the American cause during the Revolution. His will reads thus ; \" I also give to the society of Amity, in the town of New Haven, for the support of a Presbyterian or Congregational minister, in said society, he being a friend to this, and the United States of Ame rica, after my wise's estate therein shall be ended,\" &ic. The regicides, Goffe and Whalley, had a number of places of con cealment in the limits of this town, the most noted of which is called the Lodge or Hatchet Harbor, about seven miles from New Haven. It was situated (says Dr. Stiles, in his history of the Judges) at a spring in a valley. \" A little northward of it was an eminence, called the Fort to this day, from whence there was an extensive and commanding pros pect, and a full view of New Haven harbor to the southeast, seven miles off. From this they could see the vessels passing in and out of the harbor. When they came to this abode is uncertain ; \u2014 it was in the summer, and they left it and removed to Milford, August, 1661, after having resided in and about New Haven for near half a year, from the 7th of March to the 19th of August, 1661.\" \" On a tract about a mile square, and lying four miles northwest of Sperry's [farm,] there"], [284, "270 WOODBRIDGE. are four hills or eminences, between which are valleys and intercurrent brooks On the northern declivity of one of these hills, issues a small perennial spring, between two trees, a walnut and chestnut, now three and sour feet in diameter, and judged to be two hundred years old, standing twenty-two feet apart. This fountain is stoned as if with design, and probably remaining as the Judges left it. Tradition says that when they came to this spring, one of them said, \" Would to God we had a hatchet ;\" and immediately finding a hatchet, left there probably by the Indian hunters, they cut down boughs and built a temporary harbor, from this circumstance called Hatchet Harbor to this day.\" \" On an eminence west of this, by the side of a ledge of rocks twenty feet high, was built a cave, or convenient lodgment, ten feet long and seven wide, regularly stoned. I find the walls (says Dr. Stiles) now remaining, though somewhat broken down. It was covered with trunks of trees, which remained, though much rotten and decayed, till within forty years ago ; indeed I saw some of the rudera, rasters, or broken relics, hmbs and trunks of trees, still lying in the cavity. This was undoubtedly their great and principal lodge, and in a very recluse and secreted place. There is a beautiful spring six rods from it.\" About 100 rods north, \" on Deacon Peck's farm, lies another hillock or eminence, called to this day, and in the records so early as 1675, ' Providence Hill ; be tween which and Fort Rock's Hill, is a valley and brook. Between these two hills runs the dividing line of the towns of Milford and New Haven. The tradition is, that it acquired its name thus. While the Judges resided at the lodge on the southern hill, they apprehended themselves discovered and pursued, while walking on the tops of the hills, \u2014 and the Indians always burned rings or tracts on those summits, to give a clear view for hunting deer. Supposing themselves discover ed, they took to the bush, and to deceive their pursuers, ranged a north course between the hills, and giving them a false scent, turned off to the westward, and came round the hill to their old place in security. On account of this deliverance, they called this northwest hill, Provi dence Hill.\" During the time they were in the vicinity of New Haven, the Judges had \" two other occasional lodgments in the woods ; one at the house of Mr. Riggs, newly set up in the wilderness, at Paugasset or Derby ; an other between that and Milford. They were sometimes at Totoket or Branford.\" \u2014 <\u25a0' From their lodgments in the woods the Judges removed and took up an asylum in the house of Mr. Tomkins, in the center of Milford, thirty or forty rods from the meeting house.\" It is stated, that there was a house built for them on Tomkins's lot, about twenty feet square, and of two stories. The lower room was built with a stone wall and considered as a store ; the room above was built of wood, and was used by the Tomkins family as a working or spinning room. The family used to spin in the room above, ignorant of the Judges being below, where they resided for two years, without going abroad so much as into the orchard."], [285, "271 NEW LONDON COUNTY. New London County is bounded n. by Windham, Tolland and Hartford Counties, e. by Windham County and the state of Rhode Island, s. by Long Island sound, and w. by the county of Middlesex. Its average length from east to west averages about 26 miles, and it has a medium breadth of about 20 miles. This county possesses superior maritime advantages, having an extensive border on Long Island sound, which affords numerous bays, inlets and harbors. Excepting a small section, principally in the town of Lyme, no portion osthe county can be considered as mountainous, but it is generally hilly and elevated, and comprises a small proportion of alluvial. The hills and elevated tracts are considerably rough and stony. The lands in general are not adapted to grain culture, although upon the intervals and other tracts, Indian corn is raised to advantage, and to a considerable extent. The princi pal agricultural interests depend very much upon grazing. The waters of the county are abundant and valuable. On the south it is washed more than thirty miles by Long Island sound, part of its western bor der by Connecticut river, and the interior of the county is watered and fertilized by the Thames and its branches. The fishing business is more extensively carried on in this county than in any other section of the state, and is an important branch of industry. The manufacturing busi ness is carried on to a considerable extent in the northern part of the county, and is increasing.

The first English settlement in New London was made by several persons in 1646. Lots were laid out to them, but it appears that some of the settlers were discouraged and left the place. The next year Mr. Richard Blinman, who had been a clergyman in England, removed from Gloucester to this new settlement : in consequence of which consider able accession was made to the number who had kept their station. In 1648, more than forty families had joined the settlement. Some osthe principal persons were John Winthrop, Esq., the Rev. Mr. Blinman, Thomas Minot, Samuel Lathrop, Robert Allyn, and James Avery."], [286, "272 NEW LONDON. The Indian name of the place was Nameaug, alias Towawog.* The tract of country now comprised in the limits of New London, Montville, Waterford and Groton, was called Pequot for a number of years, from the name osthe harbor and original inhabitants. In March, 1658, the Assembly passed the following act respecting its name. \" Whereas it hath been the commendable practice osthe inhabitants of all the colonies of these parts, that as this country hath its denomina tion from our dear native country of England, and thence is called New England, so that planters, in their first settling of most new plantations, have given names to those plantations of some cities and towns in Eng land, thereby intending to keep up, and leave to posterity the memorial of several places of note there, as Boston, Hartford, Windsor, York, Ipswich, Braintree, Exeter ; this court considering, that there hath yet no place in any of the colonies, been named in memory of the city of London, there being a new plantation within this jurisdiction of Con necticut, settled upon that fair river Mohegan, in the Pequot country, being an excellent harbor and a fit and convenient place for suture trade, it being also the only place which the English in these parts have pos sessed by conquest, and that upon a very just war, upon that great and warlike people, the Pequots, that therefore they might thereby leave to posterity the memory of that renowned city of London, from whence we had our transportation, have thought fit, in honor to that famous city, to call the said plantation New London.\" The name osthe river was also changed and called Thames. f The town of New London is situated on the west bank of the river Thames. In its territorial limits it is much the smallest of any town in the state, being about sour miles in length from north to south, and averaging about three fourths of a mile in breadth. The city of New London is situated 3 miles from Long Island sound ; it is the semi-seat of justice for the county, and a port of entry. It is 42 miles southeast from Hartford, 13 miles south of Norwich, and 53 miles east from New Haven. Lon. 4\u00b00' 48\" east from Washington, Lat. 41\u00b0 0' 25\" north. The city is principally built on a declivity, which descends to the east and south. On the summit osthe high ground, back of the most pop ulous part of the city, the observer has a fine prospect of the surrounding country. The city is irregularly laid out, owing to the nature of the ground on which it is built, being much incumbered with granite rocks. The houses are not so handsome in their outward appearance as might be reasonably expected, considering the wealth of the inhabitants. In the course of a few years past, however, a spirit of improvement in this respect has taken place, and many buildings have been erected which are elegant in their appearance. Some osthe streets have been strait ened and leveled, by blasting the granite rocks with which they were disfigured. These rocks afford an excellent material for the construc tion of buildings, and it is believed that no city in this country has the advantages of New London, in this particular, where the materials for erecting houses can be sound in their streets.

N. view of Fort Trumbull from New London, (1830.^) New London contains five places for public worship ; 2 Congrega tional, 1 Baptist, 1 Episcopal, 1 Methodist. There are three banks, the Union, incorporated in 1792, the New London, incorporated in 1807, and the Whaling bank, recently incorporated. There are two insurance offices, the Union Marine and the New London Fire and Marine Insurance companies: the latter company has a capital stock of 250,000 dollars. From the excellent maritime location of New Lon don, the navigation, commercial and fishing business, has ever been the principal pursuit of the inhabitants. Their fine harbor has served in a great degree as the port of Connecticut river, the impediments in which frequently prevent its being navigable for large vessels fully laden. The whale fishery and sealing business is an important branch of commerce. About a million of dollars is devoted to its prosecution. In 1834, up wards of thirty ships, and 900 men and boys were employed in this business. The city is defended by two forts, Fort Trumbull and Fort Griswold. Fort Trumbull stands on the New London side of the Thames, about a mile below the city. It is situated on the rocky extremity of a pe ninsula extending eastward into the river. This fort is a station sot- United States soldiers. Fort Griswold is on the east side of the Thames, on a commanding eminence opposite the city, in the town of Groton. It is not at present occupied as a military post, and is considerably out of repair. New London has been rendered conspicuous for its sufferings during the Revolutionary war, and the theater of hostile operations. On the 6th of September, 1781, a large proportion of this town was laid in ashes by Benedict Arnold. The following account of this transaction 35"], [290, "274 NEW LONDON. is taken from the Connecticut Gazette, printed at New London, Sept. 7, 1781. \" About daybreak on Thursday morning last, 24 sail of the enemy's shipping appeared to the westward of this harbor, which by many were supposed to be a plundering party after stock; alarm guns were imme diately fired, but the discharge of cannon in the harbor has become so frequent of late, that they answered little or no purpose. The defense less state of the fortifications and the town are obvious to our readers ; a few of the inhabitants who were equipped, advanced towards the place where the enemy were thought likely to make their landing, and ma n\u0153uvred on the heights adjacent, until the enemy about 9 o'clock landed in two divisions, and about 800 men each, one of them at Brown's farm near the light-house, the other at Groton Point : the division that landed near the light-house marched up the road, keeping up large flanking parties, who were attacked in different places on their march by the in habitants, who had spirit and resolution to oppose their progress. The main body of the enemy proceeded to the town, and set fire to the stores on the beach, and immediately after to the dwelling houses lying on the Mill Cove. The scattered fire of our little parties, unsupported by our neighbors more distant, galled them so that they soon began to retire, setting fire promiscuously on their way. The fire from the stores communicated to the shipping that lay at the wharves, and a number were burnt ; others swung to single fast, and remained unhurt. \" At 4 o'clock, they began to quit the town with great precipitation, and were pursued by our brave citizens with the spirit and ardor of vet erans, and driven on board their boats. Five of the enemy were killed, and about twenty wounded ; among the latter is a Hessian captain, who is a prisoner, as are seven others. We lost sour killed and ten or twelve wounded, some mortally. \" The most valuable part of the town is reduced to ashes, and all the stores. Fort Trumbull, not being tenable on the land side, was evacuated as the enemy advanced, and the few men in it crossed the river to Fort Griswold, on Groton Hill, which was soon after invested by the division that landed at the point : the fort having in it only about 120 men, chiefly militia hastily collected, they defended it with the greatest resolution and bravery, and once repulsed the enemy : but the fort being out of repair, could not be defended by such a handful of men, though brave and determined, against so superior a number ; and after having a number of their party killed and wounded, they found that further resistance would be in vain, and resigned the fort. Immediately on the surrendry, the valiant Col. Ledyard, whose fate in a particular manner is much lamented, and 70 other officers and men were murdered, most of whom were heads of families. The enemy lost a Major Montgomery and forty officers and men in the attack, who were found buried near the fort : their wounded were car ried off. \" Soon after the enemy got possession osthe sort, they set fire to and burnt a considerable number of dwelling houses and stores on Groton bank, and embarked about sunset, taking with them sundry inhabitants"], [291, "275 NEW LONDON. os New London and Groton. A Col. Eyre, who commanded the di vision at Groton, was wounded, and it is said died on board the fleet the night they embarked. About 15 sail of vessels, with the effects of the inhabitants, retreated up the river on the appearance of the enemy, and were saved, and four others remained in the harbor unhurt. The troops were commanded by that infamous traitor Benedict Arnold, who headed the division which marched up to the town. By this calamity it is judged that more than one hundred families are deprived of their habitations, and most of their all. This neighborhood feel sensibly the loss of so many deserving citizens, and though deceased, cannot but be highly indebted to them for their spirit and bravery in their exertions and manly opposition to the merciless enemies of our country in their last moments.\" \" The following savage action, committed by the troops who subdued Fort Griswold, on Groton Hill, on Thursday last, ought to be recorded to their eternal infamy. Soon after the surrender of the sort, they loaded a wagon with our wounded men, by order of their officers, and set the wagon off from the top of the hill, which is long and very steep. The wagon went a considerable distance with great force, till it was suddenly stopped by a tree ; the shock was so great to those faint and bleeding men, that some of them died instantly. The offi cers ordered their men to fire on the wagon while it was running.\" The buildings burnt at New London in this expedition by the British troops, were 65 dwelling houses containing 97 families, 31 stores, 18 shops, 20 barns, and 9 public and other buildings, among which were the court house, jail and church \u2014 in all 143. \" In many instances where houses were situated at a great distance from any stores, and contained nothing but household furniture, they were set on fire, notwithstanding the earnest cries and entreaties of the women and children in them, who were threatened with being burnt in them if they did not instantly leave them. Indeed two houses were bought off for 10/. each, of an officer who appeared to be a captain, upon condition, however, that he should not be made known ; and where the houses were not burnt they were chiefly plundered of all that could be carried off. At the harbor's mouth, the houses of poor fishermen were stripped of all their furniture of every kind, the poor people having nothing but the clothes they had on.\" The following is Arnold's official account of his expedition to New London : Sound, offPlumb Island, 8th Sept. 1781. Sir, \u2014 I have the honor to inform your Excellency, that the transports with the de tachment of Iroops under my orders, anchored on the Long Island shore on the 5th instant, at 2 o'clock, P. M. about ten leagues from New London ; and having made some necessary arrangements, weighed anchor at 7 o'clock, P. M. and stood for New London with a fair wind. At 1 o'clock the next morning, we arrived off the harbor, when the wind suddenly shifted to the nonhward, and it was 9 o'clock before the trans ports could beat in. At 10 o'clock the troops in two divisions, and in four debarka tions, were landed, one on each side of the harbor, about three miles from New Lon don; that on the Groton side, consisting of the 40th and 54th reg'ts, and the 3d batt. of New Jersey volunteers, with a detachment of Yagers and Artillery, were under the command of Lieut. Col. Eyre. The division on the New London side consisted of the 38ih regiment, the Loyal Americans, the American Legion, Refugees, and a"], [292, "276 NEW LONDON. detachment of 60 Yagers, who were immediately on their landiDg put in motion ; and at 11 o'clock, being within half a mile of Fort Trumbull, which commands JMew London harbor, I deiached Capt. Millett, with four companies of the 38tn regiment to attack the fort, who was joined on his march by Capt. Fnnk, wilh one company ot the American Legion. At the same time I advanced wilh the remainder ot the divis ion, west of Fort Trumbull, on the road to the town, to attack a redoubt which bad kept up a brisk fire upon us for some time; but which the enemy evacuated on our approach. In this work we found six pieces ofcannon mounted, and two dismounted. Soon after I had the pleasure to see Capt. Milieu march into Fort Trumbull under a shower of grape shot from a number of cannon which the enemy had turned upon him; and I have the pleasure to inform vour Excellency, that by the sudden attack and determined bravery of the troops, tbe fort was carried wilh the loss ot only four or five men killed and wounded. Capt. Millett had orders to leave one company in Fort Trumbull, to delach one to the redoubt we had taken, and to join me with the other companies. No time on my part was lost in gaining the town of New London. We were opposed by a small bodv of the enemy, with one field piece, who were so hard pressed that they were obliged to leave the piece, which being iron was spiked and lest. As soon as the enemy were alarmed in the morning, we could perceive they were busily employed in bending sails, and endeavoring to get their privateers and other ships up Norwich river out of our reach; but the wind being small, and the tide against them, they were obliged to anchor again. From information I received be fore and after my landing, I had reason to believe lhat Fort Griswold, on Groton side, was yery incomplete; and I was assured by friends lo Government, aster my landing, that there were only twenty or thirty men in the fort, the inhabitants in general being on board their ships, and busy in saving their property. On taking possession of Fort Trumbull, I found the enemy's ships would escape unless we could possess ourselves of Fort Griswold ; I therefore dispatched an officer to Lieut Col. Eyre with Ihe intelligence I had received, and requested him to make an attack upon the fort as soon as possible; at which time I expected the howitzer was up, and would have been made use of. On my gaining a height of ground in the rear of New London, from which I had a good prospect of Fort Griswold, I found it much more formidable than I expected, or than I had formed an idea of, from the in formation I had before received ; I observed at tbe same time, that the men who had escaped from Fort Trumbull, had crossed in boats and thrown themselves into Fort Griswold, and a favorable wind springin\u00a3 up about this time, the enemy's ships were escaping up the river notwithstanding the sire from Fort Trumbull, and a six pounder which I had wilh me. I immedialely dispatched a boat with an officer to Lieut. Col. Eyre, to countermand my first order to attack the fort, but the officer arrived at a few minutes too late. Lieut. Col. Eyre had sent Capt. Beckwith with a flag, to demand a surrender of the fort, which was peremptorily refused, and ihe attack had commen ced. Aster a most obstinate defense of near forty minutes, the fort was carried by the superior bravery and perseverance of the assailants. The attack was judicious and spirited, and reflects the highest honor on the officers of the troops engaged, who seemed to vie wilh each other in being first in danger. The troops approached on three sides of the work, which was a square with flanks, made a lodgment in the ditch, and under a heavy fire, which they kept up on the works, effected a second lodgment upon the fraizing, which was attended wilh great difficulty, as only a few pickets eould be forced out or broken in a place, and was so high that the soldiers could not ascend without assisting each other. Here the coolness and bravery of the troops were very conspicuous, as the first who ascended the fraize were obliged to silence a nine pounder which enfiladed the place on which they stood, until a suffi cient body had collected to enter the works, which was done with fixed bayonets, through the embrazures, where they were opposed with great obstinacy by the garri son with long spears. On this occasion I have to regret the loss of Major\" Montgom ery, who was killed by a spear in entering the enemy's works; also of Ensign Whit lock, osthe 40th regiment, who was killed in the attack. Three other officers of the same regiment were wounded ; Lieut. Col. Evre, and three other officers of the 54th regiment, were also wounded ; but I have the satisfaction lo inform your Excellency, that they are all in a fair way to recover. Lieutenant Colonel Eyre, who behaved wilh great gallantry, having received his wound near the works, and Major Montgomery being killed immediately aster the command devolved on Major Bromfield, whose behavior on this occason does him great honor. Lieut. Col. Buskirk, with the New Jersey volunteers and artillery being the second debarkation, came up soon after the work was carried, having been retard ed by the roughness of Ihe country; I am much obliged to this gentleman for his ex ertions, although the artillery did not arrive in time."], [293, "277 NEW LONDON. I have enclosed a return osthe killed and wounded, by which your Excellency will observe that our loss, though very considerable, is short of the enemy's, who lost most of their officers, among whom was iheir commander, Col. Ledyard. Eighty-five men were found dead in Fovt Griswold, and sixty wounded, most of them mortally; their loss on the opposite side must have been considerable, but cannot be ascertained. I believe we have about 70 prisoners, besides the wounded who were left paroled. Ten or twelve ships were burned, among them three or four armed vessels, and one loaded with naval stores; an immense quantity of European and Wesl India goods were found in the stores \u2014 among the former the cargo osthe Hannah, Capt. Watson, from London, lately captured by the enemy. The whole of which was burnt with the stores, which proved lo contain a large quantity of powder, unknown to us; the explosion osthe powder, and change of wind, soon after the stores were sired, commu nicated the flames to part of the town, which was, notwithstanding every effort to pre vent it, unfortunately destroyed. Upwards of fifty pieces of iron cannon were destroyed in the different works, (ex clusive of the guns of the ships,) a parliculai return of which I cannot do myself the honor to transmit to your Excellency al this time. A very considerable magazine of powder, and barracks to contain three hundred men, were found in Fort Griswold, which Capt. Lemoine of the Royal Artillery had my positive directions to destroy ; an atlempi was made by him, but unfortunately failed. He had my orders to make a second attempt: the reasons why it was not done, Capt. Lemoine will have the honor to explain to your Excellency. I should be wanting in justice to the gentlemen osthe navy, did I omit to acknowl edge lhat upon this expedition I have received every possible aid from them. Cap tain Beasley has made every exertion to assist our operations, and not only gave up his cabin to the sick and wounded officers, but furnished them with every assistance and refreshment that his ship afforded. Lord Dalrymple will have the honor to deliver my dispatches; I beg leave to refer your Excellency to his Lordship for the particulars of our operations on the New London side. 1 feel myself under great obligations to him for his exertions upon the occasion. Captain Beckwith, who was extremely serviceable to me, returns with his Lordship. His spirited conduct in the attack of Fort Griswold does him great honor, being one osthe first officers who entered the works. I beg leave to refer your Excel lency to him for the particulars of our operations on lhat side, and to say I have ihe highest opinion of his abilities as an officer. I am greatly indebted to Capt. Stapleton, (who acted as Major of Brigade,) for his spirited conduct and assistance ; in particular, on the attack upon Fort Trumbull, and his endeavors to prevent plundering, (when the public stores were burnt,) and the de struction of private buildings.

From the Connecticut Gazette, No. Extract of a Letter from Lieut Colonel Upham, to his Excellency Governor Franklin, dated Fort Franklin, Sept. 13, 1781 : \" Immediately on the receipt of yours by Capt. Camp, I made every preparation con sistent with the necessary secrecy, to furnish as many Refugees for the proposed ex pedition as could be spared from the garrison. My first care was to put a supply of provisons on board the vessels. I talked of an expedition and proposed to go my self, nor could I do more until the fleet appeared in sight. Major Hubbel was too un well to go with me ; I therefore lest him to take charge of the Fort, and, with as much dispatch as possible, embarked one hundred Loyalists, exclusive of a sufficient num ber to man the two armed sloops. With these we joined the fleet in season to prevent the least delay. By the enclosed arrangement, you will see we had the honor to be included in the first division, and I have the pleasure to add we were first on shore. We advanced on the right osthe whole to a height at a small distance from the shore,"], [294, "278 NEW LONDON. where we were ordered to cover the 38th Regiment from a wood on our right, until the second division came up. We were then ordered to change our position from the right to the left, at the distance of two hundred yards from the main body. 1 his al teration derived its propriety from the circumstance of the Rebels having gone over to the lest, from an apprehension of being too much crowded between our troops and the river on their right. Thus arranged we proceeded to the town of JNew London constantly skirmishing with rebels, who fled from hill to hill, and stone fences which intersected the country at small distances. Having reached the southerly part ot the town, the General requested me to take possession of the hill north of the Meeting House, where the rebels had collected, and which they seemed resolved to hold. We made a circle to the left, and soon gained the ground in contest. Here we had one man killed and one wounded. This height being the outpost, was left to us and the Yagers. Here we remained exposed to a constant fire from the rebels on the neigh boring hills, and from the fort on the Groton side, until the last was carried by the Brit ish troops. \" We took the same route in our return as in going up, equally exposed though not so much annoyed. Every thing required was cheerfully undertaken, and spiritedly effected, by the party I had the honor to command. A small party from Vanalstme's posl joined us, which increased my command to 120. They landed and returned with us, and behaved exceedingly well. The armed vessels Association and Colonel Martin, went close into the shore, and covered the landing on the New London side. At the request of the General, I furnished boats to land forty of the troops on the Gro ton side. Captains Gardner and Thomas would gladly have gone up to the town, but were not permitted.\" The following is from the New London Gazette, January 4, 1782. \" Last Friday died at Groton, Mr. Carey Leeds, of fever, which he took from Mr. Daniel Eldridge, a neighbor and friend of his, that died the 1st instant, who with one hundred and thirty men were landed here on the 3d ult. from New York, in a most deplorable situation ; a great part of them have since died, and those of them that have survived, are in such a debilitated state that they will drag out a miserable exist ence. Numbers in this unhappy town and Groton have lost their lives by taking them in, and great numbers of others have been brought to the gates of death, and still lie in a languishing condition. It is enough to melt the most obdurate heart of any one, (except a Briton,) to see these miserable objects continually landing here from every flag that comes; see them poured out upon desolated wharves, sick and dying, and the few rags they have on covered with vermin and their own ex crements In short, if their is no redress for this intolerable evil, this town and Groton must be depopulated.\" After the close of the Revolutionary war in 1783, the General Assem bly appointed a committee to estimate the damages sustained by the several towns in the state that had been ravaged by the enemy during the war. The damages sustained by New London were estimated by the committee at $485,980. To compensate the sufferers in this, and the other towns, the General Assembly, in May, 1793, granted them 500,000 acres of the tract of land reserved by Connecticut, at their cession of lands to the United States, lying south of the western part of Lake Erie, being what are now called \" the Fire lands,\" in the western part osthe Western Reserve, in the state of Ohio. During the late war New London was the theater of hostile indica tions.

The concentra tion of a considerable force of the enemy at this place, produced con-"], [295, "279 NEW LONDON. siderable alarm, and a large body of militia, drafted from different parts osthe state, were kept here to repel any attack from the enemy. Be sides the militia, a considerable body of United States troops were sta tioned here. The sorts were strongly garrisoned, and the British made no attempt upon the place. About the year 1720, a sect arose in New London, called, from their leader, Rogerenes. The following account of this people is from Dr. Trumbull's History of Connecticut, second volume. \" The Rogerenes were a sort of Quakers, who had their origin and name from one John Rogers of New London. He was a man of unbounded ambition, and wished to be something more than common men. One Case and one Banks, two lewd men, called singing Quakers, coming through the colony singing and dancing, accompanied with a number of women to assist them in their musical exercises ; and especially to proclaim how their lips dropped with myrrh and honey, fell in company with John, and at once made a convert of him lo llieir religion. He, in a high degree imbibed their spirit, and ever retained it. Notwithstanding, it was not long after, before he commenced a seventh day Baptist. After maintaining the opinion of this sect for a short time, he returned again to Quakerism. To gratify his pride, and that he might appear as the head of a peculiar sect, he differed in several points from the Quakers. Particularly he maintained that there were three ordinances of religious use, baptism, the Lord's supper, and imposition of hands. To make himself more eminent, as the head of a new sect, he commenced preacher of his peculiar scheme, and without any kind of ordination, administered baptism to his followers. The madness, immodesty, and tumultuous conduct of Rogers and those who followed him, at this day, is hardly conceivable. It seemed to be their study and delight to violate the Sabbath, insult magistrates and ministers, and to trample on all law and authority, human and divine. They would come on the Lord's day, into the most public as semblies nearly or quite naked, and in the time of public worship, behave in a wild and tumultuous manner, crying out, and charging the most venerable ministers wilh lies and false doctrine. They would labor upon the Lord's day, drive carts by places of public worship, and from town to town, apparently on purpose to disturb Christians and Christian assemblies. They seemed to take pains to violate the laws in the pre sence of officers, that they might be complained of, and have an opportunity to insult the laws, the courts, and all civil authority. A particular instance of their conduct on a certain occasion, when Rogers was in dicted for a high misdemeanor, may serve as a specimen of their spirit and conduct in general. The crime for which he was indicted, and the manner of his own and his followers' conduct, will appear from the following extract from Prau's Historical Account of Quakerism. ' It was his manner to rush into the assembly on the Lord's day, in the time of God's worship, in a very boisterous way, and to charge the minister with lies and false doc trine ; and to scream, shout, stamp, &c. by which he offered insufferable molestations to the worship and people of God. And this was his manner in the court also, when he pleased, or had a mind to make himself sport, and he would laugh at it when he had done until his sides shook. ' I saw him once brought to court for such a disturbance, committed on the Sabbath. He had contrived the matter so as to be just without the door when he was called to answer; upon which he rushed into court with a prodigious noise ; his features and o-estures expressed more fury than I ever saw in a distracted person of any sort, and I soberly think, that if a legion of devils had pushed him in headlong, his entrance had not been more horrid and ghastly, nor have seemed more preternatural. ' When he came to the bar, he demanded of the court what their business was with him 1 The indictment was ordered to be read. To this he pleaded not guilty, aster a new mode ; for as the clerk read, sometimes at the end of a sentence, and sometimes at the beginning, he would cry out, That's a cursed lie; and anon, That's a devilish lie ; till at length a number of his followers, of both sexes, tuned their pipes, and screamed, roared, shouted and stamped to that degree of noise, that it was impossible to hear the clerk read.' He professed to be a most holy man, guided in all his conversation by the Holy Ghost, so lhat, for the course of twenty years, he had lived wilhout the commission of one sin. Yet he was almost constantly committing such gross offenses. He was divorced from an amiable wife for fornication and supposed beastiality. The latter"], [296, "280 NEW LONDON. he often confessed out of court. When he had occasion, he took to his bed a maid whom he had purchased, and after she had borne him two children, he put her away. He suffered a long imprisonment, upon a strong suspicion that he was an accomplice in burning the meeting-house in New London. He once sat upon the gallows upon a conviction of blasphemy. For these and the like instances, he and his followers suf fered the penalties osthe law ; but for his religion, neither he nor his followers suffered any thing, any further than it led them to such misdemeanors as are punishable by the laws of all Christian nations.\" Many anecdotes are related concerning this singular people, one of which is the following. Among other violations of law and order by the Rogerenes, they took to themselves wives without complying with the requirements of law and decency. \" One day as Gov. Saltonstall was sitting in his room smoking his pipe, a man by the name of Gorton, with a woman, came in, and addressing the Governor, said, 'sir, I have married this woman, and that too, without the authority of your magis trates and ministers.' The Governor turned round, took the pipe out of his mouth, and in a stern voice said, ' Gorton, have you taken this woman for your wife ?' Gorton replied, ' yes, I have.' The Gov ernor turned to the woman, and enquired, ' madam, have you taken this man for your husband ?' She replied, ' Indeed, sir, I have.' ' Well, then,' said the Governor, ' by authority of, and according to the laws of Connecticut, I pronounce you lawfully wedded, husband and wife/ Gorton was astonished, and after a pause replied, ' Thou art a cunning creature.' \" It is said to be contrary to the tenets of the Rogerenes to employ physicians, or to use medicines in case of sickness. The following method of preserving a clear conscience in this respect, is related upon good authority. \" A number of these people were afflicted with a cer tain cutaneous disorder, and their principles forbidding them the use of medicines, they were at a loss what to do. After deliberating upon the subject, they came to the conclusion that this disorder, (or whatever else it might be called,) could not come under the head of bodily in firmity. It was determined that the Itch might be considered as a noxious animal, which they might innocently destroy. They accord ingly made use of the usual remedies found efficacious for this disorder.\" A considerable number of the descendants of tbe Rogerenes still reside in Groton, New London and its vicinity. Many years since, a person by the name of Watrous, one of this sect, wrote and published a book, called '\u2022' The Battle Axe.\" Such was the nature of this publi cation, that he could find no printer who was willing to print it. De termined however that his book should be published, Watrous procured a printing press and types, and printed the work himself. This book is said to be a curiosity, from the nature of the work, and from the typographical execution. So little faith have this people in other de nominations of Christians around them, that quite recently they would not suffer any of their people to assist, as carpenters, or otherwise, in the construction of a new church, lately erected in New London. Jedediah Huntington, a general in the army of the Revolution, al though a native of Norwich, was long a resident of New London. He"], [297, "NEW LONDON. 281 died in 1818, in his 76th year, having survived every general officer of the Revolution, except Gen. Stark, the hero of Bennington. He was educated at Harvard University, where he was graduated in 1763. He settled in his native town as a merchant, but at the commencement of the Revolution he entered the American army as colonel of a regiment. His intelligence, bravery and fidelity as an officer, secured to him the respect and gratitude of his country, and the attachment and lasting confidence of Washington. He continued in the service through the war, and attained to the rank of a general officer. In 1788, he was appointed treasurer of Connecticut, and was a member of the convention of the state which ratified the federal constitution. On the organization osthe general government, he was appointed by Washington collector osthe port of New London, the duties of which office he discharged to the entire satisfaction osthe public and the government, during a period embracing sour successive administrations. General Huntington be came a professor of religion when young, and was distinguished for the excellence of his private character. He was one of the first members of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, and held the office till his death. Judge Brainard's Monument. The Hon. Jeremiah G. Brainard, a judge osthe superior court, was a resident of this town. He was born at East Haddam, educated at Yale College, and commenced the practice of law in New London in early life. He was esteemed an able and faithful lawyer, a worthy man, and good judge. He died at New London, January 14th, 1830, in the 70th year of his age. His son, John G. C. Brainard, was dis tinguished for his poetic genius. He was educated for the bar, but not finding the success he wished, he went to Hartford in 1822, and took the editorial charge of the Connecticut Mirror; he was thus occupied until about a year before his death, when marked by evident symptoms as a victim to the consumption, he returned to the paternal roof, where, sensible of his approaching dissolution, he embraced the Christian hope, and died September 26th, 1828, aged 32 years. The above is a representation of the monument of Judge Brainard and his son John G. C. Brainard. Judge Brainard's monument is con- 36"], [298, "282 NEW LONDON. structed of granite, and is perhaps one of the best models for a monu ment that could be devised, combining simplicity with durability. It is situated in the new burying ground, which is on elevated ground, de scending towards the city, the central part of which is but a lew rods distant. It commands a fine view of the harbor and the surrounding distant. scenery Bishop Seabury's Monument. The following is the inscription on Bishop Seabury's monument.

Bishop of Connecticut and Rhode Island, who departed \"from this transitory scene, February 25th, Anno Domini 1796, m the 68th year of his age, and the 12th of his Episcopal consecration.

The ancient burying ground in New London is situated in the north part of the city, a short distance from the river, on elevated ground, immediately back of the houses.

This house is 48 feet in front by 20. It is one of the three ancient houses which still remain. It was built and first occupied by Sir Rob ert Hempstead, and being entailed property has ever remained in pos session of his descendants : it is now in possession of Mr. Joshua Hemp stead, the seventh generation from Sir Robert. This house was for merly fortified for defense against the Indians. It is about forty rods west of the present court house. The first vessel that sailed for the West Indies from New London, sailed from the cove within twenty rods of this house. The first settlement osthe town appears to have been commenced on what was called Cape Ann street. The last house built by the first settlers stood on this street ; it was taken down about twelve years since : it was about half a mile west of the present court house. The first meeting house in New London was erected very near the present alms house. Gov. Winthrop's residence was at the head of the cove, at the north end of the city. The first printing press in Connecticut was established in New Lon don, forty five years before printing was executed in any other place in the colony. The first printer was Thomas Short, who came to New London about the year 1709. He printed the Saybrook Platform (which is said to be the first book printed in Connecticut) in 1710, and soon after died. In 1713, there was no printer in the colony; and a great proportion of the laws were only in manuscript. The Assembly determined on revising and printing the laws, and desired the governor and council to procure a printer to settle in the colony. The council ob tained Mr. Timothy Green, a descendant of Mr. Samuel Green of Cam bridge in Massachusetts, the first printer in North America. The Assem bly, for his encouragement, agreed that he should be printer to the gov ernor and company, and that he should have fifty pounds, the salary of"], [300, "284 NEW LONDON. the deputy governor, annually. He was obliged to print the election sermon, the proclamations for fasts and thanksgivings, and the laws which were enacted at the several sessions of the assembly. In 1714, he came into Connecticut, and fixed his residence at New London. He and his descendants were printers to the state till after the Revolution ary war. The second newspaper printed in Connecticut, the \" New London Summary,\" was commenced at New London, on the 8th of August, 1753, by Timothy Green, and discontinued in consequence osthe death of Mr. Green, in 1763. The \"Summary\" was succeeded Nov. 1st, 1763, by the \" New London Gazette,\" (altered in 1773. to the \" Con necticut Gazette,\") which is still continued, and is the oldest newspaper in the state. The Gazette is printed and published at the present time by Col. Samuel Green, a descendant from the ancient printers osthe colony. The following copy of a letter from the Hon. John Winthrop, Esq. of New London, to the Rev. Dr. Mather of Boston, is taken from the second volume of Massachusetts Historical Collections. New London, September 12, 1717. Sir \u2014 Being from home Ihe last post day, when your leiter arrived here, 1 am now lo thank you fur- it, and lo make answer lo what yon demand ol me. The observations I made of the pn digious sloi ras of snow, in ihe doleful winter past, are many. But I shall mention but two at this time, and they are these. That the snow spangles which fell on the earth, appeared in large sexnngular forms. Seu nirem so: radia tam ; el Stellas has nireas observavi print ostrolrgi vulgo od>[ecium dcpingvnt sexli lem. The olher is, thai, among the small fleck of sheep, that 1 daily fold in this dis tant part of the wilderness, (lor I am a poor shepherd.) to secure them Ire m the wild rapacious quadrupeds of Ihe forest ; alter ihe unusual and unheard of snows, the aforesaid animals from ihe upland parts of ihe country, were, in gieat numbers forced down to the sea side among us, for substance, where Ihey resiled, kenneled and bur roughed in the thick swamps of these ample pastures, nightly visiting ihe pens and yards for their necessity. * * * * The storm continued so long and severe, that multitudes of all sprts of creatures perished in Ihe snowdrifts. We lost at ihe island and larms, above eleven hundred sheep, besides seme callle and horses, interred in the snuw. And it was very strange lhal twenty eight days after the storm, the tenants of Fisher's Island, pulling out the ruins ot one hundred sheep out of one snow bank in a valley, (where the snow had drifted over them sixteen feet,) found two of them alive in the drift, which had lain on them all that time, and kept them selves alive by eating the wdol off the others, that lay dead by them. As soon as they were taken out osthe drift they shed their own fleeces and are now alive and fat ; and I saw them at the island the last week, and they are al your service. The storm had its effect also on ihe ocean : The sea was in a mighly ferment, and aster it was over, vast heaps osthe enclosed shells came ashore, in places where there had never heen any osthe sort before. Neptune wilh his tridenl, also, drove in great schools of porpoises, so lhal the harbor and river seemed to be full of them ; but none of these came on shore, but kept a play day among the disturbed waves.

And as to mv informer, he was always plotting and con trivinghow to accomplish your business without discovering i l to any more; but he was so needy that I believe he had never so much monev together lo carry him down and keep him there any time for the purpose; and a few weeks before he died, he was proposing to me for a new trial and discovery of the thing. Sir, what I know abont it I have truly, faithfully, and ingeniously communicated to you, and hope by some means or other, you may in time be the belter for it.

John Winthrop. To the Rev. Doctor Cotton Mather. Answers to several of the queries proposed by the officers of the British government, (1774,) relative to New London. Answer 1. The latitude of New London, ihe best harbor in Connecticut, is, by ob servation, 41\u00b0 25' north, and longitude 4\u00b0 45' west from London, that is, 71\u00b0 15' west from London, by observation of the eclipses of the moon, calculated by Halley's tables. 5. New London, as above, is one of the principal harbors, and opens to the south ; and from the light-house at the mouth of the harbor lo the town is about three miles, and a breadth of three fourths of a mile and more in some places, from five to six fathoms water, a clear bottom, tough ooze, and entirely secure and commodious one mile above the town for large ships. 7. The principal trade of this government is lo the West India Islands, excepting now and then a vessel to Ireland wilh flax-seed, and to England with lumber and pot ashes, and a few to Gibraltar and Barbary. There are 72 sail of vessels now belonging to this district, amounting to 3,247 tons, in which there are 406 seafaring men employed, besides upwards of twenty sail of coasting vessels, that employ about ninety seamen. On comparing, the trade is on the decrease ; for in the year 1763, there were seventy nine sail of vessels belonging to this district, a difference of seven sail. 8. It is impossible to enumerate the various soils of British manufactures lhat are here imported ; but in geneial almost every sort is consumed here; which we have principally from New York, and Boston, to the amount, upon a medium, from the best information I can get, of 150,000/. or 160,000/. sterling per annum. 9. Besides the English islands, (which supply this government with more than its home consumption of rum and sugar,) it has a trade with the French and Dutch West Indies, Gibraltar and Barbary. Those vessels that go lo Ihe French and Dutch plantations carry horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, provisions and lumber ; those for Gibral tar and Barbary carry flour, lumber, New England rum, and stores for muling, the whole annual amount of which, (I should think,) about 50,000/. sterling; for which we receive molasses, cocoa, cotton, and some sugar, and from the Dutch plantations bills of exchange ; and the mules from-Barbary are generally sold in the West Indies for bills of exchange, the most of which importation and bills goes to New York and Boston to pay for the British goods this government receives from those places. 10. The custom house officers here are attentive to their duty, besides which, this harbor is so situated, that the coming in from the sea is between the east end of Long Island and Block Island, and by the west end of Fisher's Island, where the kings cruisers are generally upon the look out, and very critical in examining the vessels they meet with. 11. The natural produce of this country is timber, iron and copper ore, myrtle wax, &c. The produce and staple commodities are Indian corn, wheat, rye, beef, pork, flax, flax-seed, oats, beans, peas, potatoes, cheese, cider, apples, etc. which articles are carried in the coasting vessels to New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Virginia and Caro lina, to what value is very difficult to determine ; but I should think to at least 20,000/. sterling, which, with the 50,000/. sterling in the foreign trade, makes, on this estima tion, the annual amount of exportation from this district 70,000/. sterling. It is evident the whole falls short of paying for the British manufactures we receive, as many of our traders have sailed, and the New Yorkers have taken their landed interest in this colony in payments to a very considerable amount. The chief manufactures are pot and pearl ashes, bar iron, and necessary implements for husbandry, &c. extracts from newspapers. From the Connecticut Gazette, July 10th, 1762. We hear from New London, that on Thursday se'nnight died there Mr. Ebenezer Bolles of that town, trader, esteemed a very honest and hospitable man. He has left one child, a daughter, of about seventeen years of age ; and an estate of about five thousand pounds lawful money. The occasion of his death was as follows, \u2014 a few * This appointment afterwards took place."], [302, "286 NEW LONDON. days before, he had been cutting some vines or bushes which were of a nox quality, \u25a0whereby he was poisoned, and his body swelled to a great degree ; but being of the sect called by the name of Rogerenes, who forbid the use of means in sickness, he would neither allow a physician to be near him, nor the most simple medicine admin istered. Just before he expired, when in great pain, he seemed desirous ot some help, but the brethren and sisters of that profession would not allow it, lest he should deny the faith.

This should excite every lover of his country, to promote as much as possible this laudable undertaking, by saving all their linen rags. New London Gazette, No. 160, Dec. 5, 1766. We hear from Middletown, that on the 21st inst, the Hartford fleet arrived there, consisting of two sloops and a scow, conveyed by a batteau from Springfield. The fleet was separated in the night of the 18th, by a sudden squall, which look them as they opened a small brook, and occasioned much damage ; one man bruised his finger cutting away a thowl pin on board the convoy, but is likely to recover. The convoy was obliged to bear away for Wingham, and by the help of jury masts, reached her port, where she is refitting ; and it is thought she will be able to put to sea in a fort night. One osthe fleet struck upon a mud turtle, but happily no lives were lost. The scow came to anchor and rode out the storm. The same day arrived two scows from the other side of the river, with sand, after a fine passage of half an hour, the people all well on board. New London, Con. Jour. Sept. 27/A, 1771. About three or four years ago a few Mackerel were discovered to be in New Lon don Harbor and River, tho' chiefly very small, which have every year since been in creasing, both in size and in quantity : \u2014 and such a plenty has there been of those val uable fish the present year, as that from forty to seventy boats have been daily em ployed below the town in catching them. And by the best computation that can be made about 300 barrels have already been caught in this season, from the first of Au gust to the present time, nearly equal in size to those of Boston Bay. Last Tuesday six barrels of those fish were drawn in a seine at Norwich Landing. From the Connecticut Gazette, No. 765, July 10, 1778. About three weeks ago, Mr. Robert Sheffield of Stonington, made his escape from New York, after a short confinement on board a prison ship. Aster this young gen tleman was taken, he with his crew, 10 in number, were put into irons and thrust into the forepeak ; on their arrival at New York, they were carried on board a prison ship and to the hatchways, on opening of which tell not of Pandora's box, for that must be compared to this, an alabaster box, in comparison to the opening of these hatches. True there were gratings, but they kept their boat upon them. The steam of the hold was enough to scald the skin, and take away the breath\u2014 the stench enough to poison the air all around. On his descending these dreary mansions of woe, and beholding the numerous spectacles of wretchedness and despair, his soul sainted within him. A little epitome of hell\u2014 about 350 men confined between deck of which about one half were Frenchmen : and he informed that there were three more of these vehicles of contagion, which contained the like number of miserable French men also, who are treated if possible worse than Americans. The heat so intense (the hot sun saining all day on deck,) that they were all naked, which also served the well to get rid of the vermin, but the sick were eaten up alive. Their sickly countenances and ghastly looks were truly horrible ; some swearing and blaspheming \u25a0 some crying, praying, and wringing their hands, and stalking about like ghosts and apparitions ; others delirious and void of reason, raving and storming; some groanin^ and dying\u2014 all panting for breath ; some dead and corrupting. The air was so foul at times that a lamp could not be kept burning, by reason of which the boys were not missed till they had been dead 10 days. One person only is admitted on deck at a"], [303, "NEW LONDON. 287 time after sun-set, which necessarily occasions much filth to run into the hold, and mingle with the bilge water, which to his certain knowledge had not been pumped out while he continued on board; notwithstanding the decks were leaky, and the prisoners begged for permission to let in fresh water and pump it out again ; but all in vain, their hearts are callous and dead lo their cries, prayers and entreaties; five or six died every day Mr. Sheffield was on board. He was only six days on board, and three of his people died in that short time. He was sent for on shore to attend as evidence at the Court of Admiralty for condemnation of his vessel, and happily made his escape from the horridest of deaths. He was informed in New York, that the fresh meat sent in to the prisoners by our commissary, was taken by the men of war for their own use. This he can say, lhat he did not see any on board the ship he was in ; but acknowledged that they were well supplied wilh soft bread from our commissary on shore. But the provision, (be what it will,) is not the complaint. Fresh air and fresh water, God's free gist, is all their cry. Ncio London, August 18th, 1779. We hear from Saybrook, that a boat lately returning into Connecticut river, from Long Island, where she had been on an illicit trade, was stopped by the fort at Say brook, when a quantity of goods were taken out of the boat, and lodged in the custody ofone Mr. Tully, an officer of the fort, who stored them in his dwelling house; and on Sunday night, 8th instant, eight men broke into the house with a view of carry ing off the goods ; on which the officer fired on them, killed two at the first shot, and wounded another with a bayonet. On this the others made off, carrying the wounded man with them. \u2014 A warning to this kind of gentry. New London, November 11th, 1781. Last Saturday evening a flag of truce returned here from New York, and bro't 132 American prisoners, among them are Ebenezer Ledyard, Esq. and Lieut Jabez Stow, on parole, with the remainder of the prisoners who were captivated and carried off from New London and Groton by Benedict Arnold's burning party: But the prisoners are chiefly from the prison ship, and are mostly sick. Captain Jonathan Budington, jun. late of the Brig Favorite, Mr. George Worthy lake, and Daniel Shapley, (son of Cant. Adam Shapley,) all of this town, lately died on board the prison ship; and Mr. John Monroe, of this town died on board the flag the night it arrived. New London, July 1, 1785, (923.) Tuesday evening was tried before the Court of Common Pleas, now sitting here, a cause brought by a Mrs. Eggleston of Stonington, against one Reuben Rathbun, an exhorler among the people called the Shaking Quakers, for defaming her, by uttering sundry expressions of and concerning her, at a public meeting in Stonington. After a full hearing, the Jury retired, and in about an hour returned with a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for \u00a320 damage, and her cost. Connecticut Gazette, No. 1787. New London, February 7, 1798. John Kunkapot, a chief of the tribe of Oneida Indians, arrived here last week. We were informed by him, that he had been on a mission to the Mohegan tribe, being au thorized to invite them to sell their lands in Montville, and move among ihe Oneidas, where they would be received as members of their tribe, without any reward. The Mohegans, excepting one or two who are very old, have determined to remove if they can obtain permission from the Legislature to sell their lands. The remnant of this once powerful tribe is reduced to about 200 souls. They pos sess upwards of 5000 acres of land, the most of which is of an excellent quality, and cannot be alienated without permission from the State Legislature. From the Connecticut Gazette, No. 1504, {New London,) September 6, 1792. The trade and manufactures of this state, (says a correspondent,) have long strug gled under the want of a capital proportioned to the industry and enterprise of its citi zens; \u2014 that want may now be supplied by means of the banks established at New Lon don and Hartford. Every useful occupation and every industrious citizen may be assisted with money, as circumstances may require and justify: but in order to carry the means of the bank into the fullest effect, their bills must circulate among all ranks of people freely as money: it behoves, therefore, every well wisher to the prosperity of the community, to give credit to the notes of the bank. Although trade may more immediately, and in a more considerable degree, be benefitted by these institutions, yet every other branch of business will come in for a proportionable share ; a flourish-"], [304, "288 NEW LONDON. ing commerce dispenses blessings to all within the sphere of its operations, and adds to the value of the landed interests, as well as the articles in which it principally deals. The notes of the banks will be found more convenient for a circulating medium, and may be kept by the owners in greater safety, than hard money, and none need be ap prehensive of any deception in them, as the promise on the face of them will be care fully and punctually fulfilled. New London, Dec. 29, 1797. On Saturday last, at 1 o'clock, P.

At length our citv, for so many years remarkable for salubrity of air and the health iness of its inhabitants, is dressed in shrouds and sackcloth. A deleterious fever has prevailed here for about ten days ; the first victim to it was Capt. Elijah Bingham, whose death we mentioned in our last, together with three children\u2014 since which there have died twenty-one, sixteen of whom died by the fever. The contagion, if there be any, appears confined to Bank street, from the Market to Golden Hill street; those who have died either lived in, kept store, or were particularly connected in that street. , Yellow Fever in New London. The following account of the yellow fever in this place, in 1798, is extracted from a pamphlet, written and printed at New London, by Charles Holt, immediately after the fever had subsided. On the 26th of August, (1798,) the inhabitants of New London were somewhat alarmed by the death of Capt. Elijah Bingham, keeper of the Union Coffee House, after an illness of but two or three days. His funeral was immediately attended, it being Sunday, by the Union Lodge of Free Masons, of which he was a member, and an unusual number of people, whom the solemnity of the ceremony and esteem for the deceas ed drew together. It was, however, remarked at the time, that if the extreme hot weather continued, it would not be long before the burying ground would be so thronged again : and the remark was too fully veri fied. Two days after, three persons in the neighborhood died of the same disease, which was soon ascertained to be the dreadful Yellow Fe ver. The citizens now perceived their danger and removed from the infected part ; the corporation and civil authority left their posts, and a health committee, consisting of John Woodward, John lngraham, James Baxter, and Ebenezer Holt, Jr. were appointed to attend the burial of the dead, the care of the sick, and relief of the indigent. The sickness rapidly increasing, the next week witnessed no less than twenty five deaths, among whom were some of the most respectable characters belonging to the city or state, and the wife, a son, and a daughter of the late Capt. Bingham, in the vicinity of whose house the contagion was yet principally confined. This very great mortality among so small a number of people, filled the citizens with consternation : tbe dead were interred with all possible speed, and without the least formal ity, the hearse being commonly attended only by the sexton and two or three black assistants, one of whom died of the prevailing disease."], [305, "289 NEW LONDON. Laying out the corpse, ornamenting the coffin and covering it with a pall, &c. were generally dispensed with, every consideration giving way to the important duty of consulting the safety and convenience of the survivors. The country people naturally shunned the pestilential air of the devoted city, and the adjoining towns look measures for pre venting our flying inhabitants from spreading the infection. From this period the progress of tbe disease was varied according to the favorable or unfavorable changes in the air, the effects of which were visibly perceived on the persons of the sick, and the number of new cases which occurred. That portion of the city where it first ap peared being almost entirely abandoned, it gradually extended into most of the compact parts within the distance of an hundred rods; but de creased in the violence of its symptoms and frequency of its attacks, as the season advanced, and by the 14th of October, it had so far abated that the citizens began to return to their dwellings and resume their usual occupations. The mortality within the aforesaid limits, (viz. one hundred rods north and south from the market,) was equal to that among the same number of inhabitants, in any part of Philadelphia in the same length of time. In Bank street below the market, to the south corner of Gol- den-hill street, of those who did not remove from the spot, but two per sons over twelve years of age escaped the infection. In this space, ex cluding the buildings which were evacuated and the people who fled, are 15 houses, shops and stores, in which lived or were employed 92 per sons, of which 90 had the fever, 33 died, and 2 escaped entirely. The deaths above the market were not in so great proportion. By October 28th, the fever had nearly disappeared after having in about eight weeks cut off 81 persons. \" The weather for some weeks previous to the fever, was uncom monly dry and warm, light breezes and calms had long prevailed, no rain had fallen for two months, vegetation was parched, wells were dried, and the crops within a few miles distance, were cut off. Tbe mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer frequently stood in the shade at 96 degrees, and several times at 98, a height never before witnessed here ; and sea captains complained that they never felt so much incon venience from the warmth in the West Indies.\" Dr. Webster, in his history of epidemic and pestilential diseases, (Vol. 1, 338, says, \" considerable quantities of salted fish, which lay in certain stores, which had not been well cured with the usual quantity of salt, became fetid and offensive.\" This was opened and spread in the street where the disease first appeared. \" It is probably true, (says he,) that the bad state of the fish was partly owing to a previous bad state of the air: although it afterwards became a cause of a worse state of air. What seems to put this beyond doubt, is the unusual number of musketoes, in the adjacent country, and multitudes of flies of un common size, exceeding what had been before observed.\" \" Early in the sickness all the physicians, but one who was too much indisposed to practice, and another, Dr. Rawson, who was violently attacked with the fever, deserted the city, excepting Dr. Samuel H. 37"], [306, "290 NORWICH. P. Lee, to whose lot it fell alone and unassisted, to combat the fury of this dreadful pestilence such was the difficulty in procuring nurses and watchers, that some of our most opulent citizens were seen going from house to house with money in their hands, offering any price for assistance even for a single night in vain. ' New London, April 10, 1799. So long and severe a winter as the one hardly now past, has not been known in the memory of the oldest man living. Its injurious effects have been felt in a particular manner by the inhabitants of some of our neighboring towns. Pinched by the scar city of fodder and the uncommon coldness of the weather, the cattle have died in abundance. Some farmers lost twenty head in a very short time. In Lyme it is sup posed one fourth of the stock perished. Stonington has suffered in an equal degree, and Montville and Colchester considerably, wilh the prospect of a still further loss. From the Connecticut Gazelle, No. 1869, 'New London) Sept. 4, 1799. This city during the summer now closed, has enjoyed its usual mild and salubrious atmosphere; and in many respects has the season been distinguished from the pesti lential summer of 1798. In that summer, from the 28lh of July to the 1st of Septem ber, the heat was intense; the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer, placed in the open air, stood at mid-day from 86\u00b0 to 93\u00b0, wilh the exception of five days in which it stood at 82\u00b0, and one dav at 78\u00b0, which was its greatest depression. There was only one thunder shower during this period. The earth being parched under excessive droughts, vegetation failed early in August, and many trees shed their leaves. It was noticed that the air was remarkably unelastic, especially in that part of the city where the desolating sickness prevailed. Our usual fresh southwesters left us, and we had only very light winds in the day. Scarcely a day occurred for seven weeks, in which a person mi^ht not have carried a lighted candle through the streets. The nights, in gloomy succession, brought a deadly calm, attended with sultry heat. Such a season as that of 1798, is not in the recollection of the oldest citizen. NORWICH. Norwich was first settled in 1660. During the wars between Un cas and tbe Narragansetts, Uncas was closely besieged in his fort near tbe Thames, until his provisions became nearly exhausted and he with his men were on the point of perishing by famine or sword. Fortu nately he found means of giving intelligence to the scouts who had been sent out from Saybrook fort. By his messengers, he represented the great danger the English would be in, were the Narragansetts suffered to overpower the Mohegans. \" Upon this intelligence, one Thomas Leffingwell, an ensign at Say brook, an enterprising, bold man, loaded a canoe with beef, corn and peas, and under the cover of night paddled from Saybrook into the Thames, and had the address to get the whole into the fort. The en emy soon perceiving that Uncas was relieved, raised the siege. For this service, Uncas gave Leffingwell a deed of a great part, if not the whole town of Norwich. In June, 1659, Uncas, with his two sons, Owaneko and Attawanhood, by a more formal and authentic deed, made over to said Leffingwell, John Mason, Esq., the Rev. James Fitch and others, consisting of thirty five proprietors, the whole of Norwich, which is about nine miles square. The company at this time gave Uncas and"], [307, "291 NORWICH. his sons about \u00a370, as a further compensation, for so large and fine a tract.\"* In the spring of 1660, the Rev. James Fitch, with the principal part of his congregation, removed from Saybrook to Norwich, and began the settlement of the town. Three or four planters joined them from New London, and two or three from the towns of Plymouth and Marshfield, in Massachusetts. In 1663, the general court ordered that the deed should be recorded. The limits were afterwards ascertained, and the town received a patent of the whole. The southern boundary of Nor wich did not meet Uncas' deed, the northern boundary of New London, by neatly three miles. This strip of land became a bone of contention between individual whites, and between the English and Mohegans, in stigated by some of the disaffected English, in after years. It is now included in tbe first society in Montville, in the eastern part of what is now called Mohegan. \"In 1697, the Rev. Gurdon Saltonstall, of New London, preached an election sermon at Hartford, and for his reward, the Legislature ceded to him some hundred acres at the west end of this strip. An cient deeds mention being bounded by, or being a part of the Salton stall land ; and some osthe oldest men pretend to point out some of the old bounds, &c. The first English house erected on this strip was in the days of George (?) Winthrop, after the Charter. It was of stone. The site is still visible, as also the well and old pear trees, said to be the descendants of the original stock, but by their antique appearance, they are very original. The house is said to have been the first Eng lish house erected on the route, by land, through the wilderness from New London to Wethersfield. It was in the vicinity of Uncas' chief fortress, on Fort Hill, in Mohegan, about one mile and a half westerly. Many wonderful stories are related to this day about what happened to and near this house in days of old.\" The tract is now within the lim its of Montville. \" The Mohegans were a great defense, and of essential service to the town, for many years. They kept out their scouts and spies, and so constantly watched their enemies, that they gave the earliest notice of their approach, and were a continual defense against them. For this purpose, in times of danger they often moved and pitched their wig wams near the town, and were a great terror to the enemy. Once the hostile Indians came near to the town upon the Sabbath, with a design to make a descent upon it ; but viewing it from an eminence, and see ing the Mohegan huts, they were intimidated, and went off without do ing the least damage.\" Norwich is now bounded n. by Franklin, e. by the Shetucket and Thames rivers, which separate it from Lisbon and Preston, s. by Mont ville, and w. by Franklin and Bozrah. The township has an average length from north to south of 7 miles, with a medium breadth of about three miles. The surface of the town is diversified by hills and valleys ; the prevailing soil is a dark colored gravelly loam, generally strong and fertile. * Trumbull's History of Connecticut."], [308, "292 NORWICH. Eastern view of the central part of the town of Norwich. The above is a representation of the Congregational church, the old Court House and Union Hotel, in the central part of the town of Nor wich, about two miles northwest of Norwich city. There are perhaps about 200 houses, situated on a number of pleasant rural streets, within a short distance from the church. This part of Norwich is called the town. The old court house is the first building seen on the left of the engraving ; it formerly stood on the green, in front of the meeting house. Within a year or two past, the courts have been held at Norwich city, and it is intended to use this building for a high school. Immediately back of the church rises a rocky eminence, from which is a fine pros pect of the surrounding scenery. During the Revolutionary war, a powder house stood on the summit of this elevation, which contained a number of tons of gunpowder. The building, which was of wood, was set on fire; the whole quantity of powder exploded at once, and did considerable damage to the bouses in the vicinity. The firing of this building was supposed to be the act of some person unfriendly to the American cause ; when first discovered, it was about the size of a hat crown. To attempt to put it out was deemed too hazardous an under taking, until a colored man, induced by the offer of a considerable re ward, made the attempt. As he was carrying up water to extinguish the flames, having gone about half way up the hill, the building blew up, leay'mg scarcely a single vestige to show where it stood ; the col ored man, however, was entirely unhurt. Westville, (formerly called Bean Hill,) is that section of Norwich, lying westward of the center, and is built principally on one street, the central part of which is about one mile westward of the Congregational church in the center. In this part of the town, about two miles west from the Congregational church, on the Yantic, where there is now a woolen factory, was formerly the site for iron works, at which Mr. Elijah Backus, a very ingenious me chanic, manufactured a number of cannon for the Revolutionary army; this he effected by welding together pieces of iron."], [309, "293 NORWICH. Norwich City is situated at the head of navigation of Thames river, at the point of land formed by the junction of the Shetuckel and Yan tic rivers, whose united waters constitute the Thames. The main part of the city is built on the southern declivity of a high and rocky hill : the houses are built in tiers, rising one above another. The city, as it is approached from the south, presents one of the most beautiful, in teresting and romantic prospects in the state. The buildings, which are mostly painted white, appear in full view for a considerable dis tance down the river ; these contrasted with the deep green foliage covering the rocky and elevated banks of the river, give a picturesque variety to the scene, forming on the water a delightful avenue to the city. There are in this city, (or, as it was formerly called, Chelsea or Norwich Landing,) 4 banks, a court house, and town hall. A high school for boys, and a female academy, in which the higher branches of education are taught, have been in operation for a considerable time, and are in flourishing circumstances. About a mile eastward of the Landing, is situated the flourishing village of Greenville, at the eastern extremity of which a dam has been constructed across the Shetucket, which will it is calculated furnish sufficient water power to carry 60,000 spindles : four or five large factories, and perhaps 40 or 50 dwelling houses, are, or are about to be built. Among the factories there is perhaps the most extensive paper mill in the state, owned by the Chel sea Manufacturing Company. There are also two other paper mills near the falls, which do an extensive business ; one of which :is owned by Mr. A. H. Hubbard, the other by Mr. Russell Hubbard. Large quantities of paper are manufactured for the New York market. The first paper manufactured in Connecticut was made in this town, by Col. Christopher Leffingwell. There are, at and near the falls, 9 or 10 es tablishments for manufacturing purposes. Besides these, and those at Greenville, there are some others in oth er parts of the town. The principal manufactures are those of cotton, paper and woolens. It is believed that in respect to its water privi leges, Norwich is considered to be the second town in New England. There are 8 houses of worship in the town \u2014 3 for Congregationalists, 2 for Methodists, I Episcopal, 1 Baptist, and 1 for Universalists. Nor wich City is 13 miles n. of New London, 38 s. e. from Hartford, 38 s. w. from Providence, and 50 n. e. from New Haven. Lat. 41\u00b0 34' ; long. 4\u00b0 55' east from Washington. The population of Norwich in 1830 was 5,179; of which 3,144 were in the city limits. The following engraving shows the appearance of some osthe principal manufacturing establishments at the falls osthe Yantic, at the head of a cove which sets up about one mile from the Thames. Above the cove, \" the bed of tbe river consists of a solid rock, having a perpendicular height of ten or twelve feet, over which the whole body of water falls in an entire sheet upon a bed of rocks below. The river here is com pressed into a very narrow channel, the banks consisting of solid rocks, and being bold and elevated. For a distance of 15 or 20 rods, the channel or bed of the river has a gradual descent, and is crooked and covered with pointed rocks. The rock, forming the bed osthe river at"], [310, "294 NORWICH. 5. E. view of the Factories at Yantic Falls, Norwich. the bottom of the perpendicular falls, is curiously excavated, some of the cavities being five or six feet deep, from the constant pouring of the sheet of water for a succession of ages.\" At the bottom of the falls there is the broad basin of the cove, where the enraged and agita ted element resumes its usual smoothness and placidity, and the whole scenery about these falls is uncommonly beautiful and picturesque. A short distance north of the building represented in the engraving, on an elevated bank, on the northern edge of a grove, is the royal burying ground of the Uncases. It is in contemplation to erect a monument to the memory of Uncas at this place. The foundation stone is already laid. President Jackson in his tour to the New England states, assisted in the ceremony of laying it. A number of the monuments of the royal line of the Uncases are still remaining. The following are copied from those that remain : \" Here lies ye body of Pompi Uncas, son of Benjamin and Ann Uncas, and of ye royal blood, who died May ye first, 1740, in ye 21st year of his age.\" \" Here lies Sam Uncas, the 2d and beloved son of his father, John Uncas, who was the grandson of Uncas, grand sachem of Mohegan, the darling of his mother, being daughter of said Uncas, grand sachem. He died July 31st, 1741, in the 28th year of his age.\" \"In memory of Elizabeth Joquib, the daughter of Mahomet, great grand child to ye first Uncas, great sachem of Mohegan, who died July ye 5th, 1750, aged 33 years.\" The following inscription is said to have been on a monument for merly standing here in memory of Samuel Uncas : For beauty, wit, for sterling sense, For temper mild, for eloquence, For courage bold, for things wa'ureegan * He was the glory of Moheagan\u2014 Whose death has caused great lamentation Both to ye English and ye Indian nation. * These lines are said to have been written by Dr. Tracy of Norwich. Waurcegan signifies clothes, household furniture, &c. of a costly description."], [311, "295 NORWICH. \" In 1826, a descendant of Uncas, by the name of Ezekiel Mazeon, aged 27, was buried in Norwich in the Indian burying ground. The funeral was attended by the Rev. William Palmer, who made a short but appropriate address to the remnant of the tribe assembled on that occasion. After the funeral rites were performed, Mrs. Goddard, the wife of the Hon. Calvin Goddard, in whose immediate vicinity the bu rial yard lies, (he being absent,) invited the tribe, a score or two, to partake of a collation.\" In the following year, 1827, (says Dr. Holmes,) a discovery was made of Indian relics, too illustrative of Indian customs to be left un noticed. A note of Mrs. Huntington, of Norwich, accompanying one of these relics, presented to me this year, (1828,) illustrates the entire subject. \" If we admit Indian cemeteries as proofs of local partialities, we should judge that Norwich was a favorite residence of the ancient Mohegan tribe ; for their royal burying ground is in the center of the city. In the eastern border of their reserve is a fine stream, called Trading Cove brook, on which is the ' Shantup burying ground.' the largest of their nation. On the 16th of October, 1827, the Rev. Mr. Palmer of this city was invited to attend the funeral of an Indian child, which was to be deposited in that spot. In approaching the ground, the relics of two Indians, and also two spoons, were seen lying beside it. Expressing a wish to obtain them, Mr. P. received no immediate answer, until a youth of their company had whispered something in every ear, from the oldest to the youngest. At the close of the exer oises, with great formality, the young Indian replied, ' Your request is granted.' In answer to the inquiry why two skeletons were found in the ground, an old woman replied, it was an Indian and Squaw ; and informed him farther, that according to their custom, the bodies were deposited in an upright position, within a circular grave, and a pot of succotash between them, the fragments of which were found. The \u2022decayed stump of a large tree covering the relics, indicated the an tiquity of the grave.\" In the eastern part of this town is a place called Sachem's Plain. This spot is rendered memorable by the battle between Uncas and Miantonimoh, the sachem of the Narragansetts. The army of Mian tonimoh was routed, he taken prisoner and afterwards executed and buried here. \" He was buried on the spot where he was slain. But a few years since a large heap of stones, thrown together by the wan dering Indians according to the custom of their country, and as a mel ancholy mark of the love the Narragansetts had for their fallen chief, lay on his grave ; but the despicable cupidity of some people in that vicinity, has removed them to make common stone wall, as it saved them the trouble of gathering stones for that purpose. The spot of his sepulture is, however, yet known.\"* The following account is taken from Dr. Trumbull's History of Con necticut. * Third volume, third series Massachusetts Historical Collections, p. 135."], [312, "296 NORWICH. \" Miantonimoh, without consulting the English, according to agreement, without proclaiming war, or giving Uncas the least information, raised an army of nine Hun dred or a thousand men, and marched against him. Uncas s spies discovered me army at some distance and gave him intelligence. He was unprepared but rallying between four and five hundred of his bravest men, he told them they must by no means suffer Miantonimoh to come into their town ; but must go and fight him on^fiis way. Having marched three or four miles, the armies met upon a large plain. W hen tney had advanced within fair bow shot of each other, Uncas had recourse to a stratagem with which he had previously acquainted his warriors. He desired a parley, ana both armies halted in the face'of each other. Uncas gallantly advancing in the lront of his men, addressed Miantonimoh to this effect, \" You have a number of stout men with vou, and so have I with me. It is a great pity that such brave warriors snou <1 be killed in a private quarrel between us only. Come like a man, as you pro ess to be and let us fight it out. If you kill me, my men shall be yours ; but it 1 kilt you, your men shall be mine.\" Miantonimoh replied, \" My men came to fight, and they shall fight.\" Uncas falling instantly upon the ground, his men discharged a shower of arrows upon the Narragansetts ; and, without a moment's interval, rushing upon them in a furious manner, with their hideous Indian yell, put them immediately to flight. The Mohegans pursued the enemy with the same fury and eagerness with which they commenced the action. The Narragansetts weie driven down rocks and precipices, and chased like a doe by the huntsman. Among others Miantonimoh was exceedingly pressed. Some of Uncas's bravest men, who were most light of foot, coming up with him, twitched him back, impeding his flight, and passed him, that Uncas might take him. Uncas was a stout man, and rushing forward, like a lion greedy of his prey, seized him by his shoulder. He knew Uncas, and saw that he was now in the power of the man whom he had hated, and by all means attempted to destroy ; but he sat down sullen and spake not a word. Uncas gave the Indian whoop and called up his men, who were behind, to his assistance. The victory was complete. About thirty of the Narragansetts were slain, and a much greater number wounded. Among the latter was a brother of Miantonimoh and two sons of Canonicus, a chief sachem of the Narragansett Indians. The brother of Miantonimoh was not only wounded, but armed with a coat of mail, both which retarded his flight. Two of Miantonimoh's captains, who formerly were Uncas's men, but had treacherously de serted him, discovering his situation, took him, and carried him to Uncas, expecting in this way to reconcile themselves to their sachem. But Uncas and his men slew them. Miantonimoh made no request either for himself or his men ; but continued in the same sullen, speechless mood. Uncas therefore demanded of him why he would not speak. Said he, \" Had you taken me, I should have besought you for my life.\" Uncas, for the present, spared his life, though he would not ask it, and returned with great triumph to Mohegan, carrying the Narragansett sachem, as an illustrious trophy of his victory.\"* Uncas conducted Miantonimoh to Hartford. Here his mouth was opened, and he plead most earnestly to be left in the custody of the Eng lish, probably expecting better treatment from them than from Uncas. He was accordingly kept under guard at Hartford, till the meeting of the commissioners at Boston. After an examination of the case, the commissioners resolved, \" that as it was evident that Uncas could not be safe while Miantonimoh lived ; but that, either by secret treachery or open force, his life would be continually in danger, he might justly put such a false and bloodthirsty enemy to death.\" They determined it should be done out osthe English jurisdiction. They advised Uncas that no torture or cruelty, but \" all mercy and moderation be exer cised in the manner of his execution.\" \" Immediately upon the return of the commissioners of Connecticut and New Haven, Uncas with a competent number of his most trusty * This account is taken from a manuscript of Mr. Hide of Norwich, from Governor Winthrop's journal, and from the records of the United colonies, in one or other of which, all the facts are ascertained.

He was made ac quainted with the determination of the commissioners, and receiving his prisoner, marched with him to the spot where he had been taken. At the instant they arrived on the ground, one of Uncas's men, who marched behind Miantonimoh, split his head with a hatchet, killing him at a single stroke. He was probably unacquainted with his fate, and knew not by what means he fell. Uncas cut out a large piece of his shoulder and ate it in savage triumph. He said, ' It was the sweetest meat he ever ate, it made his heart strong.' \" The Mohegans, by the order of Uncas, buried him at the place of his execution, and erected a great heap or pillar upon his grave. This memorable event gave the place the name of Sachem's Plain. f Two Englishmen were sent with Uncas, to witness that the execution was done, and to prevent all torture and cruelty in the manner of its per formance. Connecticut and New Haven, agreeably to the direction of the commissioners, sent a party of soldiers to Mohegan, to defend Uncas against any assault which might be made upon him, by the Nar ragansetts, in consequence of the execution of their sachem.\" The following is copied from a monument in the ancient burying ground in Norwich town.

We also hear that Mr. Jonathan A very of this town, has made free an able and industrious negro man, upon the same noble principles. Norwich, January 1st, 1778. Last Sabbath there was a contribution in the several parishes in the Town for the non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers in the Continental army that belong here.

Norwich, December 4th, 1792. On Thursday evening last, a young man by the name of Cook, aged 19, was in stantly killed in this town by the discharge of a swivel. The circumstances as near as we can recollect, were as follows:\u2014 In celebration of the day, (being Thanksgiv ing,) a large number of boys had assembled, and by pillagipg dry casks from the stores, wharves, &c. had erected a bonfire on the hill back osthe Landing, and to make their rejoicings more sonorious, fired a swivel several limes ; at last a foolish fondness for a loud report induced them to be prelty lavish of their powder\u2014 the explosion burst the swivel into a multitude of pieces, the largest of which, weighing about seven pounds, passed through the body of the deceased, carrying with it his heart, and was afterwards found in the street 30 or 40 rods from the place where it was fired. While the serious lament the unhappy accident, they entertain a hope that good may come of evil, that the savage practice of making bonfires on the evening of Thanksgiving may be exchanged for some other mode of rejoicing, more consistent with the genuine spirit of Chrjstianiiy. s"], [319, "301 B 0 Z R A H . BOZRAH. Bozrah, formerly New Concord, originally in the bounds of Nor wich, was incorporated a town in 1786. Some of the first settlers in this town were of the names of Waterman, Fox, Hough, and Crocker, Fox and Hough located themselves about the center of the place, and Waterman in tbe eastern part. Its average length is four and a half miles, and its average breadth four. It is bounded n. by Franklin, e. by Norwich, s. by Montville, and w. by Lebanon and Salem. The township is uneven, consisting of hills and valleys ; \" its geological char acter is granitic, and the soil is a gravelly loam, which is generally rich, warm, and fertile.\" There are three houses of worship in the town ; 1 Congregational, 1 Baptist, and 1 Methodist. There is also a Bap tist meeting house which stands on the dividing line between this town and Colchester. The central part of the town is 14 miles from New London, and 33 from Hartford. East view of Fitchville, Bozrah. There are two cotton manufacturing villages in the limits of this town, Bozrahville and Fitchville, both situated on Yantic river. Bozrahville is situated on and near the dividing line between this town and Lebanon, and is about eight miles from Norwich city. The above is an eastern view of Fitchville, a little more than five miles from the Landing in Norwich city, on the Hartford turnpike. The principal part osthe village was built by Nehemiah H. Fitch, Esq. and his brothers in 1832. The Bozrah post office is in this village. The name of this town, (Bozrah,) is said to be derived from the follow ing occurrence. In ancient times, an aged, plain sort of a man lived where Fitchville is now built : though a respectable inhabitant, he was not very remarkable for quoting scripture correctly. On one occasion,"], [320, "302 BOZRAH. in quoting from Isaiah the passage \" Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?\" &c. he stated that the prophet Bozrah said thus and so. Mistakes of this kind are not easily forgotten : the old gentleman was ever afterwards called the Prophet, and the place of his residence Bozrah ; and when the town was incor porated, it was thought advisable to retain the name by which the place was generally known. The following account of a remarkable hail storm which took place in this town, in July, 1799, is taken from the Connecticut Journal, copied from the Connecticut Gazette. Bozrah, Monday, July 15, 1799. On Monday, July 15th, the inhabitants of the southern part of Lebanon, and of the towns of Bozrah and Franklin adjoining, experienced the most awful and devas tating storm of wind, attended with hail and rain, thunder and lightning, probably ever known in our county. About five o'clock, P. M. a dark angry cloud gradually arose from the south ; it continued increasing and gathering blackness and rapidity of motion as it rose. In about half an hour after, a cloud of a brass or flame color, seemed to roll up in front of it, like a column of smoke, which presently overspread it, growing brighter and appearing more wild and agitated. At ihis time an extensive black cloud before unperceived, rose along from the N. W. to S. W. similar to ihe first, and in a little time formed a junction with it, when they directly shot their united summits high in the air, and the whole hemisphere by six o'clock was covered with almost the darkness of night, emitting sharp forked lightning, followed with heavy thunder. A calm of a tew minutes succeeded, while the birds and beasts guided by instinct, fled for refuge, as portending some great calamity. The wind with a distinct roar soon began to blow with great violence, and increased almost to a hurricane: when astonishing to behold, hail stones of a prodigious size, two and three inches in diameter, were driven with almost the force of grape shot, upon everything in its course ; they were at first scattering, but in a moment came thicker and larger, until they fell in a complete shower of ice, so great as to prevent an object from being distinguished at the distance of two or three rods. Directly, scarce an inch of glass was left in the windows next the storm, and in some instances the sashes were broken ; shingles were split and beat off the roofs of houses and barns, and vegetation almost wholly laid waste by the fury of the hail ; while the wind overturned trees, unroofed, removed, or destroyed barns and fences. Every thing seemed in confusion and uproar, and men and beasts were silent with astonishment. This scene lasted according to dil ferent judgments, ten, fifteen, and twenty minutes, though most agree that the greatest discharge ofhailfell in, a shorter time. When the hail ceased, ashower of rain more abundant if possible, immediately followed ; and collecting, ran with violence, swept the hail into large waves, and the ruins into heaps, and bore them away promiscuously to the torrents and low grounds, presenting a most singular and melancholy sight. After an hour had abated, and the sun just setting, broke through the clouds and af forded a prospect dreary and gloomy beyond description. The earth seemed almost desolate and a waste. The poor beasts were objects of the first attention : the cattle were found alive, though sadly bruised and wounded, the backs of cows were bloody, legs of horses cut and swollen ! when the smaller animals suffered much more : some pigs of four months old, with sheep, were killed, numbers of geese, turkies, &c. ex posed, were beat to death : birds are daily found in large numbers, in the fields and gardens, dead and maimed: buildings and fences are seen bruised to such a degree that they will long remain standing proofs of the violence and size of the hail. \u2666 * * * * * * The horrors of the scene and the ravages of the storm are truly indescribable. Many of the sufferers can only compare them with their ideas of the day of judgment. The hail stones were so large as to be taken for the falling of bricks from the chimney upon the roofs of the houses. After the rain, which must have washed them, they were carefully examined in different places, and found to measure, some four and a half inches by five and a half in circumference, others six inches some six inches by nearly seven ; they are generally compared by spectators to the full size of hen s and geese eggs. Banks of hail five or six inches deep remained on the Saturday and Sunday following, and some measured then three and a half inches round ; they were generally more flat than round, with ragged edges The course of the storm was chiefly from ihe S. W. to the N. E. though sometimls the hail came from the south, and then again nearly from the west; windows were broken on"], [321, "C OLCHESTER. 303 three sides of houses. It run much in veins, damaging only some fields, and totally destroying others adjoining. The hail extended nearly four miles in width, where it was dreadful : it grew wider in Franklin, which is to the east, and seemed to spend itself there, ending in rain beyond that place. It was doubtless the same cloud which passed over Litchfield county, &c. scattering its hail through the State, even to the mouth of the Connecticut River, which united with the other in the south, took this di rection, and here spread its most distinguishing horrors. 'Tis considered almost miraculous by the people, that amidst all this distress, the lives of men and beasts have been wonderfully preserved. Only two or three men have been knocked down, and one or two children, one of which, 14 years old, was so beaten as to be deprived of reason for two days.\" COLCHESTER. The settlement of Colchester began about 1701. In 1698 the Le- gislature enacted that a new plantation should be made at Jeremy's farm. It was determined that it should be bounded southerly on Lyme, westerly on Middletown, and easterly on Norwich and Leba- non. This was most commonly called the plantation at Twenty-mile river, and was originally within the limits of the county of Hartford. Some of the principal planters were the Rev. John Bulkley, Samuel Gilbert, Michael Taintor, Samuel Northam, John Adams, Joseph Pom- eroy, and John Loomis. Colchester is bounded n. by Hebron and Marlborough, w. by Chat- ham, e. by Lebanon, and s. by East Haddam and Salem. Its aver- age length from east to west is about 9 miles, and its breadth about 4, comprising an area of about 43 square miles. The face of the town- ship is generally uneven, being hilly, and in some places somewhat rough and stony. The prevailing soil is a gravelly loam, tolerably strong and fertile. Iron ore of the best quality has been recently found in this town ; the beds apparently are inexhaustible ; the best bed is about one mile n. w. of the Congregational church. There are three houses of worship, 2 for Congregationalists and one for Baptists. Westchester society is possessed of a fund sufficient for the support of the ministry, and also a free grammar school for two thirds of tbe year. In the first located society, there is a pleasant village of perhaps 40 or 50 houses, having an elevated and healthful situation. The following en- graving shows the Congregational church and Bacon Academy, situated on the western side of the open green, in the center of the village. The small one story building with a cupola, seen on the left, is the confer- ence house, used for holding religious meetings. The school for colored children is seen north osthe church, under the trees; the hill seen in the distance, is called Bulkley Hill, between which and the village is a deep valley. Bacon Academy is so called from Mr. Pierpont Bacon, its bene- factor and founder. It was established in 1800, and possesses $35,000 in funds. The Academy is built of brick, 75 feet by 34, three stories high, spacious and commodious. It is a free school for the inhabitants of the society, and is open for scholars from abroad upon very accom- modating and moderate terms. All the higher branches of an English education are taught, and the institution is accommodated with philosoph ical apparatus of various kinds. There are usually about 200 scholars,"], [322, "304 COLCHESTER. with four or five instructors. This institution has ever been considered one of the most respectable and flourishing academies in the state. It is 20 miles from New London, 23 from Hartford, 15 from Norwich, and 10 from East Haddam Landing. Bacon Academy and Congregational Church, Colchester. John Bulkley, the first minister in this town, was the son of the Rev. Gershom Bulkley. \" His mother was the daughter of President Chauncy. He was graduated at Harvard College in 1699, and was ordained December 20, 1703. His death took place in June, 1731. \" Mr. Bulkley was very distinguished as a scholar. While a mem ber of college, he and Mr. Dummer, who was a member of the same class, were considered as preeminent in genius and talents. The palm was given to the latter for quickness, brilliancy, and wit; but Mr. Bulk ley was regarded as his superior in solidity of judgment and strength of argument. He carried his researches into the various departments of tbe law, of medicine, and theology. His son, John Bulkley, who was also eminent for his learning, possessed a high reputation as a physician and lawyer, and when very young was appointed a judge .of the supe rior court of Connecticut. \"Mr. Bulkley was classed by the Rev. Dr. Chauncy, in 1768, among the three most eminent for strength of genius and powers of mind, which New England had produced. The other two were Mr. Jere miah Dummer and Mr. Thomas Walter. He published an election ser mon in 1713, entitled ' the necessity of religion in societies.' In 1724 he published an inquiry into the right of the aboriginal natives to the lands in America. This curious treatise has within a few years been reprinted in the collection of the Historical Society of Massachusetts. The author contends, that the Indians had no just claims to any lands, but such as they had subdued and improved by their own labor, and that the English had a perfect right to occupy all other lands without"], [323, "COLCHESTER. 305 compensation to the natives. He published one other tract, entitled ' an impartial account of the late debate at Lyme upon the following points; whether it be the will of God, that the infants of visible believers should be baptised; whether sprinkling be lawful and sufficient; and whether the present way of maintaining ministers by a public rate or tax be law ful,' 1729. In this he gives some account of the rise of the antipedo baptist persuasion.\"* The following humorous story, in which Mr. Bulkley, the first min ister in this town, was concerned, is from an ancient publication. \" The Rev. Mr. Bulkley of Colchester, Con., was famous in his day as a casuist and sage counselor. A church in his neighborhood had fallen into unhappy divisions and contentions, which they were unable to adjust among themselves. They deputed one of their number to the venerable Bulkley, for his services; with a request that he would send it to them in writing. The matters were taken into serious consideration, and the advice wilh much deliberation committed to writing, ll so happened, that Mr. Bulkley had a farm in an extreme part of the town, upon which he entrusted a tenant; in superscribing the two letters, the one for the church was directed to ihe tenant, and the one for the tenant to the church. The church was convened to hear the advice which was to settle all their disputes. The moderator read as follows: You will see lo the repair of the fences, that they be built high and strong, and you will lake special care of the old black bull. This mystical advice puzzled the church al first, but an interpreter among the more discerning ones was soon found, who said, Brethren, this is the very advice we most need; the direction to repair the fences is to admon ish us to take good heed in the admission and government of our members : we must guard the church by our master's laws, and keep out strange cattle from the fold. And we must in a particular manner set a watchful guard over the Devil, the old black bull, who has done so much hurt of late. All perceived the wisdom and fitness of Mr. Bulkley's advice, and resolved to be governed by it. The consequence was, all the animosities subsided, and harmony was restored to the long afflicted church. What the subject of ihe letter sent to the tenant was, and what good effect it had upon him, the story does not tell.\" In this town, Westchester society, is the monument of Col. Henry Champion, a native of East Haddam, deputy commissary general of the armies of the United States, in the Revolution, and in that station eminently useful. To this gentleman, Washington, in his distress for provisions at Valley Forge, applied for relief, and the first relief to the starving army, came from his land. He died in 1796. The following is from the Colchester Town Records ; the tradition is, that this thanksgiving was put off on account of there being a deficiency of molasses, an article much used on these occasions. \"At a legal Town meeting held in Colchester, Oct. 29th, 1705. It was voted, that whereas there was a thanksgiving appointed to be held on the first Thursday in November, and our present circumstances be ing such, that it cannot with convenience be attended on that day; it is therefore voted and agreed by the inhabitants, as aforesaid, (concluding the thing will not be otherwise than well resented,) that the second Thursday of November aforesaid, shall be set apart for that service.\" * Allen's Biographical Dictionary. 39"], [324, "306 FRANKLIN.

The population osthe town in 1810 was 1,161 ; in 1830 it was 1,194. There are 2 houses of worship in the town, 1 for Congregationalists and one for Methodists. Agriculture is the principal business osthe inhab itants, who live scattered about on their farms, there being no place which may be considered as a village in the town. There is a woolen factory on Beaver brook, near the Shetucket river, on the eastern bor der osthe town.

The township is uneven, being hilly and stony, and abounding with granite and other primitive rocks. A tract extending along the Sound, and another, about a mile wide, extending on the Thames the length of the township, are rich and pleasant; the remainder is generally very stony and difficult of cultivation, and abounding with forests. The town is watered by the Mystic and the Poquonock, which discharge their waters into the Sound. There are several villages ; Groton Bank opposite New London, Portersville on Mystic river, and Pequonnuc. The village embracing Portersville and Lower Mystic, is separated by the river Mystic, and connected by a toll bridge. The river is the boundary line between Groton and Stonington ; tbe village is situated about two miles from its mouth, and about seven miles east from New London. Portersville is on the west side, and Mystic on the east side of the river. The two places contain about one hundred and fifty dwelling houses, ten stores, and a post office, and a tavern in each place. A neat church is erected in Portersville, called the Mariner's church, and is open to all denominations. Mystic river is navigable for vessels of about four hundred tons burthen to the bridge, connecting the villages of Portersville and Mystic. A number of whale ships and coast ing vessels are owned here. Several of the coasting vessels are con stantly employed as wreckers, in cruising along the coast as far as the West Indies, for the purpose of saving those vessels and cargoes which have been wrecked. In some instances it has been found a very lucra tive employment. A considerable quantity of country produce is ship ped from this place for the New York market.

Groton will ever be memorable as the theater of the most important and interesting military transactions which have taken place in the state."], [327, "309 GROTON. In the early settlement of the country, the fate of Connecticut was de cided by the sword on Pequot hill, within the limits of this town, and the Pequots, the most haughty and warlike tribe of savages in New England, effectually crushed by a single blow, and their existence as a nation annihilated. In the war of the Revolution, another of the \" high places\" of Groton became an Aceldama, and the flower of her sons were sacrificed to the vengeance of an infuriated enemy. On the 6th of September, 1781, a body of British troops, about 800 in number, under the command of Lieut. Col. Eyre, landed on the Gro ton side, opposite the light-house, and having found a lame boy collect ing cattle, compelled him to show them the cart path to the fort. They landed about nine o'clock in the morning of a most delightful day, clear and still. Fort Griswold was under the command of Lieut. Col. William Ledyard, brother osthe celebrated traveler of the same name. He re sided on Groton bank, opposite New London, and was much beloved and respected by his neighbors. On the advance of the enemy, Col. Ledyard, having but about one hundred and fifty men with him in the fort, sent out an officer to get assistance, as there were a number of hundreds of people collected in the vicinity ; this officer, by drinking too much, became intoxicated, and no reinforcement was obtained. On the rejection of a summons to surrender, the British extended their lines, so that they were scattered over the fields, and rushed on to the attack with trailed arms, under the fire of the Americans, to tbe assault osthe fort on three sides. Having effected a lodgment in the ditch, they cut away the pickets, and having scaling ladders, they entered the fort and knocked away tbe gate on the inside. While the British were in the ditch, they had cold shot thrown on them, and as they were entering the embrazures, the garrison changed their weapons and sought desper ately with spears or pikes fifteen or sixteen feet in length, which did considerable execution. Unfortunately they had lent the greater part of the pikes belonging to the fort to a privateer a few days before. Major Montgomery was hoisted up on the walls of the fort by his sol diers ; as he was flourishing his sword on his entrance, he was mortally wounded by Jordan Freeman,* a colored man, who pierced him through with a spear. Another officer was killed by a musket ball, while in the fort. As he fell, he exclaimed, \"put every one to death, don't spare one.\" Col. Ledyard, finding further resistance useless, presented his sword to an officer, who asked him who commanded the fort. \" I did,\" said Col. Ledyard, -'but you do now;\" the officer (Capt. Bloomfield) took his sword and plunged it into his bosom. Col. Ledyard fell on his face and instantly expired. An indiscriminate massacre now took * Most of the facts mentioned in this account were related to the compiler of this work by an eye witness, Mr. Joshua Baker, of Groton, who was in the fort at the time it was stormed. He was wounded, carried off prisoner to New York, and confined in the \" Sugar House.\" He mentioned that when the enemy arrived at New York, they reported a loss of five hundred men in killed, wounded, and missing, in this ex pedition. Mr. Baker was under the command of Col. Ledyard upwards of two years, and was the first man who stood sentry at Fort Griswold. Some particulars were also obtained from Capt Elijah Bailey, the post master at Groton Bank, who was one of the defenders osthe fort at the time osthe massacre."], [328, "310 GROTON.

Such had been the butch ery in the fort, that it was over shoes in blood in some parts of the parade ground. Soon after the surrender, a wagon was loaded with wounded Americans and set off down the hill ; it struck an apple tree with great force, and knocked several of these bleeding men out, and caused their instant death. One of these distressed men having been thrown out of the wagon, and while crawling towards the fence on his hands and knees, was brutally knocked on the head by the butt end of a musket, by one of the refugees who were attached to the British army. The British embarked at the foot of the hill, near the ferry, and took off a number of prisoners with them. As they left the fort, they set fire to a train, intending to blow up the magizine, in which were about one hundred barrels of powder. Fortunately it was extin guished by our people, who entered the fort soon after the enemy left it. It is stated that the enemy lost in the attack on the fort 54 killed and 143 wounded, several of whom afterwards died of their wounds. The killed of the enemy were buried by their comrades at the gate of the fort, and were so slightly covered that many of their legs and arms re mained above ground ; our people who were killed at the fort, were stripped, and so disfigured, covered with blood and dust, that with the exception of two or three, they could not be recognized by their friends, except by some particular marks on their persons.

This monument has its foun-"], [329, "GROTON. 311 dation stone at an elevation of about 130 feet above tide water; the monument itself is one hundred and twenty seven feet in height. The pedestal rises about eighteen or twenty feet, and is twenty three feet square ; on the pedestal rises an obelisk square, ninety two feet in height, twenty two feet square at its base, and eleven feet at the top. It is ascended by one hundred and sixty five stone steps inserted into the outer wall, rising in a circular form, their inner ends supported by an iron rail and banister. The monument is constructed of granite, of which there is an abundance in the vicinity. The expense of its erec tion was eleven thousand dollars ; this amount was raised by a lottery, granted by the state for this purpose. The following is the inscription, on marble, placed over the entrance of the monument. This Monument was erected under the patronage of the State of Connecticut, A.D. 1830, and in the 55th year of the Independence of ihe U. S. A.

List of men who fell at Fort Griswold, Sept. 6. 1781. Here follows a list of eighty five names, on a marble tablet. Groton was the seat of the Pequot power. The royal residence or fort of Sassacus, the chief sachem, was situated on a commanding emi nence, a little southeast of Fort Friswold. Here was the principal fort. He had another to the northwest of this, near Mystic river. The Pe quot country is described as extending from the Nehantic on the west, to Rhode Island line on the east, including the present towns of Water ford, New London and Montville, west of the Thames ; and Groton, Stonington and North Stonington on the east. All the country north of this, including the county of Windham, and part of Tolland county, has been represented as the Mohegan county. Historians have treated the Pequots and Mohegans as two distinct tribes. They appear how ever to have been parts of the same nation, named from the place of their situation. Uncas was evidently of the royal line of the Pequots, both by his father and mother, and his wife was the daughter of Tato bam, one osthe Pequot sachems. Uncas appears to have been a petty sachem under Sassacus, the great prince of the Pequot nation. When the English came to Connecticut, he was in rebellion against Sassacus, and therefore readily joined with the English, to save himself, and be avenged on his adversary."], [330, "312 GROTON. North view of Pequot Hill, Groton. The above is a north view of Pequot Hill in Groton, about 8 miles northeast from New London. This spot will ever be memorable, on account of its being the place where the first regular conflict between the English and the natives of New England took place. Here the blow was struck by which the salvation of the infant colony of Con necticut was effected, and the ruin of the haughty, warlike, and pow erful Pequot tribe of Indians accomplished. The conquest of the Pe quots struck such terror to the Indian tribes in New England, that they had no open war with the colonists for nearly forty years afterwards. The hill represented above is commanding and beautiful, though not steep. The land on which the fort stood is now owned by Roswell Fish, Esq. ; his house is seen in the engraving, standing on the summit of the hill ; the fort is supposed to have stood a few rods south of his house. Arrows, beads, arrow heads, and other Indian implements, have been found on this spot. This place is about 120 or 130 rods west of Mystic river, and about one mile north of the church in Por tersville, which is seen on the left of the engraving. The following account of the destruction of the Pequots is princi pally taken from the account written by Capt. Mason, the commander of the expedition, entitled \" A Brief History of the Pequot War.\" Uc. published in Boston in 1736. The soldiers from Connecticut, ninety in number, arrived at Saybrook on Wednesday, where they lay wind bound till Friday, 12th of May, 1637. There was a difference of opinion between Capt. Mason and his officers, whether to sail directly to Pequot (now Thames) river, or go on beyond and land his men at Narragansett. The instructions were to land the men at Pequot river. \" But Capt. Mason, apprehending an exceeding great hazard in so doing, for the reasons fore mentioned, as also some other which I shall forbear to trouble you with did therefore earnestly desire Mr. Stone that he would commend our condition to the Lord that night, to direct how, and in what manner we should demean ourselves in that Respect ; he being our Chaplm and lying aboard our Pink, the Captain on shoar."], [331, "313 GROTON In the morning very early Mr. Stone came ashoar to the Captain's chamber, and told him he had done as he desired, and was fully satisfied to sail for Narragansett : our council was then called, and the several reasons alledged : in fine we all agreed wilh one accord to sail for Narragansett, which the next morning, (May 12th,) we put in execution.\" [The little army arrived at Narragansett bay on Saturday towards evening, where they kept the Sabbath. On account osthe wind they were not able to go on shore till sunset on Tuesday, when Capt Mason landed and went to the chief sachem's resi dence and desired a free passage through his country, which was granted. The next day, Wednesday, they arrived at a place called Nayanlic, eighteen or twenty miles distant, where resided another Narragansett sachem, who lived in a fort. As they would not suffer any of the English to go into their fort, Capt. Mason set a guard around it, and would not suffer any of the Indians to go out and give information to the Pequots of their approach.] \"On Thursday, about eight of the clock in the morning, we marched thence to wards Pequot, w'ith about five hundred Indians; but through the heat of the weather, and want of provisions, some of our men fainted, and after having marched about twelve miles we came to Pawcatuck river, at a Ford where our Indians told us the Pequots did usually fish; there making an Alia, we stayed some small time; the Nar ragansett Indians manifesting great fear, in so much that many of them returned, although they had frequently despised us saying, That we durst not look upon a Pequot, but themselves would perform great things; though we had often told them that we came on purpose and were resolved, God assisting, to see the Pequots, and to fight with them before we returned, though we perished. I then enquired of Onkos, (Un cas,) what he thought the Indians would do.' who said the Nariagansetts would all leave us, but as for himself, he would never leave us: and so it proved; for which ex pression, and some other speeches of his, I shall never forget him. Indeed he was a great friend, and did great service.\" South view of Porter's Rocks, Groton. [The above is a southern view of Porter's Rocks, on the shore of Mystic river, in Groton, where Capt. Mason and his little army lay on the night previous to his attacking the Pequot fort, which was about two miles to the southwest. These rocks are situated about half a mile south of the house of Daniel Eldridge, Esq. and about the same distance from the village in Stonington at the head of Mystic. From the top of the ledge, Portersville and the ocean can be seen.] \" And after we had refreshed ourselves with our mean commons, we marched about three miles, and came to a field which had lately been planted with Indian corn: there we made another Alt, and called our council, supposing we drew near lo the enemy : and being informed by the Indians that the enemy had two forts almost impregnable ; but we were not at all discouraged, but rather animated, insomuch that we were re solved to assault both their forts at once. But understanding lhat one of them was so 40"], [332, "314 GROTON. remote that we could not come up with it before midnight, though we marched hard : whereat we were much gtieved, chiefly because the greatest and bloodiest sachem there resided, whose name was Sassacous: We were then constrained, being exceed ingly spent in our march with extreme heat and want of necessaries, to accept the nearest.\" . \" We then marching on in a silent manner, the Indians that remained fell all into the rear, who formerly kept the van, (being possessed with great tear;) we continued our march till about one hour in the night: and coming to a little swamp between two hills, we pitched our little camp; much wearied with hard travel, keeping great silence, supposing we were very near the fort as our Indians informed us, which proved otherwise. The rocks were our pillows ;. yet rest was pleasant. The j\"ght proved comfortable, being clear and moonlight. We appointed our guards, and pla ced our sentinels at some distance ; who heard the enemy singing at the fort, who continued their strain till midnight, with great exulting and rejoicing as we were af terwards informed. They seeing our pinnaces sa.ilby them some days before, conclu ded we were afraid of them, aud durst not come near them, the burthen of their song tending to that purpose.\" \" In the morning, (Friday, 26th of May,) we awaking and seeing it very light, sup posing it bad been day, and so we might have lost our opportunity, having purposed 10 make our assault before day, roused tbe men wilh all expedition, and briefly com mended ourselves and design to God, thinking immediately to go to the assault. The Indians showed us a path, and told us that it led directly to tbe fort. We held on our miich about two miles, wondering lhat we came not to the fort, and searing we might be deluded ; but seeing corn newly planted at the foot of a great hill, supposing the fort was not far off, a champion country being round about us ; then making a stand, gave the word for some of the Indians to come up; at length Onkos and one Wequosh appeared. We demanded of them, Where was the fort ? They answered on the top of that hill. Then we demanded, Where were the rest of the Indians 1 They an swered behind, exceedingly afraid. We wished them to tell the rest of their fellows, that they should by no means fly but stand at what distance they pleased, and see whether Englishmen would now fight or not. Then Captain Underbill came up, who marched in the rear; and commending ourselves lo God, we divided our men, there being two entrances into the fort, intending to enter both at once \u2014 Captain Mason leading up to that on the northeast side, who approached within one rod, heard a dog bark, and an Indian crying Owanuxl Owanuxl which is Englishmen ! Eng lishmen! We called up our forces wilh all expedition, gave fire upon them through the pallizado, the Indians being in a dead, indeed their last sleep. Then we wheeling off, fell upon the main entrance, which was blocked up with bushes about breast high, over which the Captain passed, intending to make good the entrance, encouraging the rest to follow. Lieutenant Seeley endeavored to enter ; but being somewhat cumber ed, stepped back and pulled out the bushes and so entered, and with him about sixteen men. We had formerly concluded to destroy them by the sword and save the plun der.\" \" Whereupon Captain Mason seeing no Indians, entered a wigwam, where he was beset with many Indians, waiting all opportunities to lay hands on him, but could not prevail. At length William Heydon, espying the breach in the wigwam, supposing some English might be there, entered; but in his entrance fell over a dead Indian; but speedily recovering himself, the Indians some fled, others crept under their beds. The Captain going out of the wigwam, saw many Indians in the lane or street ; he making towards them, they fled, were pursued to the end osthe lane, where they were met by Edward Pallium, Thomas Barber, with some others ; where seven of them were slain as they said. The Captain facingabout, marched a slow pace up the lane; he came down, perceiving himself very much out of breath, and coming to ihe other end, near the place where he first entered, saw two soldiers standing close to the pali sado, with their swords pointed lo the ground ; the Captain told them that we should never kill them afler this manner. The Captain also said, We must burn them; and immediately stepping into the wigwam, where he had been before, brought ont a sire brand, and putting it into the mats with which thev were covered, set the wigwams on sire. Lieutenant Thomas Bull and Nicholas Omstcd beholding, came up- and when it was thoroughly kindled, the Indians ran as men most dreadlully amazed \" \" And indeed such a dreadful terror did the Almighty let fall upon their spirits that they would fly from us and run into the very flames, where many of them perished And when the fort was thoroughly fired, command was given that all should fall off and surround the fort ; which was readily attended by all, only one, Arthur Smith be ing so wounded that he could not move out of the place, who was happily espied bv Lieutenant Bull, and by him rescued. The fire was kindled on the northeast side to the windward ; which did swiftly overrun the fort, to the extreme amazement of the enemy, and great rejoicing of ourselves. Some of them climbing to the top of"], [333, "315 GROTON. the palizado: others of them running into the very flames; many of them gathering to the windward, lay pelting at us with their arrows ; and we repaid them with our small shot ; others osthe stoutest issued forth, as we did guess, to the number ol forty, who perished by the sword.\" \" What I have formerly said, is according to my own knowledge, their being suffi cient living testimony to every particular. But in reference to Capt. Underhill and his partie's acting in this assault, I can only intimate as we are informed by some of themselves immediately alter the fight, that they marched up to the entrance on the southwest side ; there they made some pause ; a valiant, resolute gentleman, one Mr. Hedge, stepping towards the gate, saying, ' If we may not enter, wherefore came we here-!' and immediately endeavored to enter; but was opposed by a sturdy Indian, which did impede his entrance ; but the Indian being slain by himself and Sergeant Davis, Mr. Hedge entered the fort with some others ; but the fort being on fire, the smoke and flames were so violent that they were constrained lo desert the fort Thus were they now at their wit's end, who not many hours before exalted themselves in their great pride, threatening and resolving the utler ruin and destruction of all the English, exulting and rejoicing with songs and dances : but God was above them, who laughed his enemies and the enemies of his people to scorn, making them as a fiery oven. Thus were the stout-hearted spoiled, having slept their last sleep, and none of their men could find their hands. Thus did the Lord judge among the heathen, fill ing the place with dead bodies! And here we may see the just judgment of God, in sending even the very night before the assault one hundred and fifty men from the other fort, to join with them of that place, who were designed as some of themselves reported to go forth against the English, at that very instanl when this heavy stroke came upon them, where they perished with their fellows. So thai the mischief they inlended to us, came upon their own pate. They were taken in their own snare, and we through mercy escaped. And thus in little more than one hour's space, was their impregnable fort with themselves utterly destroyed, to the number of six or seven hundred as some of themselves confessed. There were only seven taken captive, and about seven escaped. Of the English there were two slain outright, and about twenty wounded ; some fainted by reason of the sharpness of the weather, it being a cool morning, and the want of such comforts and necessaries as are needful in such a case; especially our Chirurgeon was much wanting, whom we left with our barks in Nar ragansett Bay, who had orders to remain until the night before our intended assault. And thereupon grew many difficulties; our provision and munition near spent; we in the enemy's country, who did far exceed us in number, being much enraged, all our Indians except Onkos deserting us; our pinnaces at a great distance from us, and when they would come we were uncertain. But as we were consulting what course to take, it pleased God to discover our vessels to us before a fair gale of wind, sailing into Pequot Harbor, to our great rejoicing.\" \" We had no sooner discovered our vessels, but immediately came up the enemy from the other fort \u2014 three hundred or more as we conceived. The Captain led out a file or two of men to skirmish with them, chiefly to try what temper they were of, who put them to a stand ; we being much encouraged thereat, presently prepared to march towards our vessels. Four or five of our men were so wounded that they must be carried with the arms of twenty more. We also being faint, were constrained to put four to one man, with the arms of the rest that were wounded to others ; so that we had but forty men free. Al length we hired several Indians, who eased us of that burthen, in carrying off our wounded men. And marching about one quarter of a mile, the enemy coming up to the place where the fort was, and beholding what was done, stamped and tore the hair from their heads ; and after a little space, came mounting down the hill upon us, in a full career, as if they would overrun us: but when they came within shot, the rear faced about, giving fire upon them : some of them being shot, made the rest more wary ; yet they held on running to and fro, and shooting their arrows at random. There was at the foot of the hill a small brook, where we rested and refreshed ourselves, having by that time taught them a little more manners than to disturb us. We then marched on towards Pequot Harbor, and falling upon several wigwams burnt them, the enemy still following us in the rear, which was to the windward, though to little purpose; yet some of Ihem lay in ambush, behind rocks and trees, often shooting at us, yet through mercy touched not one of us; and as we came to any swamp or thicket, we made some shot to clear the passage. Some of them fell with our shot, and probably more might, but for want of munition ; but when any of them fell, our Indians would give a great shout, and then they would take so much courage as to fetch their heads. And thus we continued until we came within two miles of Pequot Harbor ; where the enemy gathered togethei and left us, we marching to the top of an hill adjoining the harbor, with our colors flying, having left our drum at the piace of our rendezvous the night before ; we seeing our vessels there riding at anchor, to our great rejoicing, and came to the water side ; we sat down in quiet.\""], [334, "316 GROTON. Captain Mason and the Narragansett Indians, continued their march by land to Connecticut river, where they arrived on Saturday about sunset, \" being nobly entertained by Lieutenant Gardner with many great guns.\" \" And when we had taken order for the safe conduct of the Narragansett Indi ans, we repaired to the place of our abode ; where we were entertained with great triumph and rejoicing, and praising God for his goodness to us, in succeeding our weak endeavors, in crowning us with success, and restoring of us wilh so little loss. Thus was God seen in the Mount, crushing his proud enemies, and the enemies of his people : they who were erewhile a terror to all that were round about them, who re solved todestroy all the English and to root their very name out of this country, should by such weak means, even seventy-seven, ihere being no more at the fort, bring the mischief they plotted, and the violence they offered and exercised, upon their own heads in a moment ; burning them up in the fire ofhis wrath, and dunging the ground wilh iheir flesh.\" In the addition given by Capt. Mason to his account, \" by way of comment,\" he says, \" our commons were very short, there being a general scarcity throughout the Colony of all sorts of provisions, it being upon our first arrival at the place. We had but one pint of strong liquors among us in our whole march, but what the wilderness afforded, (the bottle of liquor being in my hand.) and when it was empty the very smelling to the bottle would presently recover such as had sainted away, which hap pened by the extremity of the heat.\" \" I still remember a speech of Mr. Hooker, at our going abroad, that they 'should be bread for us.' \" \" I shall mention two or three special providences that God was pleased to vouchsafe to particular men, viz. two men, being one man's servants, namely John Dier and Thomas Stiles, were both of them shot in the knots of their handkerchiefs, being about their necks, and receiv ed no hurt. Lieutenant Seeley was shot in the eyebrow with a flat headed arrow, the point turning downwards; I pulled it out myself. Lieutenant Bull had an arrow shot into a hard piece of cheese, having no other defense ; which may verify the old say ing, ' A little armor would serve if a man knew where to place it.' Many such pro vidences happened; some respecting myself, but since there is none that witness to them, I shall forbear to mention them.\" Several circumstances (says Dr. Trumbull) attending this enterprise \u25a0were much noticed by tbe soldiers themselves, and especially by all the pious people. It was considered very providential that the army should march nearly forty miles, and a considerable part of it in the ene my's country, and not be discovered, until the moment they were ready to commence the attack. It was judged remarkable, that the vessels should come into the harbor at the very hour they were most needed. The life of Capt. Mason was very singularly preserved. As he enter ed a wigwam for fire to burn the fort, an Indian was drawing an arrow to the very head and would have killed him immediately, but Davis, one of his sergeants, cut the bow-string with his cutlass, and prevented the fatal shot. \" Few enterprises have been achieved with more personal bravery or good conduct. In few have so great a proportion of the effective men of a whole colony, state, or nation, been put to so great and immediate danger. In few have a people been so deeply and immediately inter ested, as the whole colony of Connecticut was in this, in that uncommon crisis. In these respects even the great armaments and battles of Eu rope are comparatively of little importance. In this, under the divine conduct, by seventy seven brave men, Connecticut was saved, and the most warlike and terrible nation in New England defeated and ruined. \" There is a remnant of the Pequots still existing. They live in tbe town of Groton, and amount to forty souls in all, or perhaps a few more or less ; but do not vary much from that amount. They have about"], [335, "317 GROTON. 1 100 acres of poor land reserved to them in Groton, on which they live. They are more mixed than the Moheagans with negro and white blood, yet are a distinct tribe and still retain a hatred to the Moheagans. A short lime since, I had an opportunity of seeing most of the tribe to gether. They are more vicious, and not so decent or so good looking a people as the Moheagans. This however may be owing to their be ing more mixed with other blood. It is very rare that there are any intermarriages with either of the tribes to each other ; they still, as far as circumstances admit, retain their old grudge. The most common name amongst them is Meazen : nearly half call themselves by that surname.\"* JSortlieastern view of Fort Hill, Groton. Fort Hill is situated four miles east from New London, and is ren dered memorable on account of its being the seat of the royal fortress of Sassacus, the haughty chieftain of the Pequots. The building seen on the summit osthe hill is the Baptist church ; the other building seen to the south is the residence of the Rev. Mr. Burrows, an aged Baptist clergyman, who has resided on this spot from his childhood. The fort of Sassacus is supposed to have stood between the house of Mr. B. and the church. This supposition is strongly confirmed, by the remains of human bones, shells, fish bones and parched corn, being found eighteen inches below the surface. Mr. Burrows states that he found a quantity of corn in a coal state, some of which he preserved many years ; he also found a pipe of soft stone, with abundance of arrow heads, &c. \"The body of the Pequots,\" (says Dr. Trumbull,) \"returning from the pursuit of Capt. Mason, repaired to Sassacus, at the royal fortress, and related the doleful story of their misfortunes. They charged them all to his haughtiness and misconduct, and threatened him and his, with * Communication of Wm. T. Williams, Esq. in 1832. Mass. Hist.

Then, upon con sultation, they concluded that they could not, with safety, remain any longer in the country. They were indeed so panic-struck, that burn ing their wigwams and destroying their fort, they fled and scattered into various parts of the country. Sassacus, Mononotto, and seventy or eighty of their chief counselors and chief warriors took their route towards Hudson river.\" The prospect from Mr. Burrows' house is one of the most command ing, beautiful and extensive on the coast. Among the various objects to be viewed from this site, are 15 towns, 4 counties, 3 states, 20 isl ands, part of the city of New London, the whole of Stonington borough, Fort Griswold and the Monument, and 7 light-houses, with rivers, bays, &tc. At the storming of Fort Griswold in the Revolutionary war, the women and children in the vicinity fled to this place, their husbands and fathers having hastened to the fort on the landing of the enemy. From Mr. Burrows' house the firing of each gun could be distinctly seen. It must have been an awful moment with such spectators, one of fearful and agonizing suspense, when they saw those whom they held most dear surrounded by an infuriated enemy, amid the \"roar of death,\" engaged in murderous strife : added to this, the conflagration of New London be yond, sending upward majestic columns of smoke and flame, must have rendered this a scene of indescribable interest and fearful sublimity. LEBANON. Lebanon is bounded n. by Columbia, e. by Windham and Franklin, w. by Colchester and Hebron, and southeast by Bozrah and Franklin. The average length from northeast to southwest is upwards of 7 miles, and it averages about the same distance in breadth. The surface is un even, being moderately hilly. The soil is generally a rich, deep, unc tuous mould, nearly of a chocolate color, fertile, and well adapted for grass. Agriculture is almost universally the business osthe inhabitants. There are three societies in the town, Lebanon, Exeter and Goshen, in each of which there is a Congregational church ; there is also a Baptist church in Lebanon, or the first society. The central part of Lebanon, (seen in this view,) is 10 miles n. w. of Norwich city, and 30 s. e. from Hartford. The following is a south view osthe Congregational church,* and other buildings in the vicinity, in the first society in Lebanon. The village * This building, which is of brick, stands on the site of the old meeting house: at the erection of this house there was a great controversy and division of the society. It appears that the majority of the society wished to have the church erected 300 rods north of its present location and accordingly it was decided by a vote of about two thirds of the society to take down the old house, and erect a new one at the dis tance mentioned.

The house, a part of which is seen on the extreme left of the engraving, is the resi dence of Wm. T. Williams, Esq. a son of the signer of the Declaration of Independence. This house is situated on the spot where Jonathan Trumbull, the patriotic governor of Connecticut, was born. The house in which the Governor resided, was situated on tbe spot where the first house north of Mr. Williams's now stands. The house of the Gov ernor is still in existence, being removed a few rods north, and is the house seen in the distance, nearest the church. The following is a representation of Gov. Trumbull's house and the old \" War Office,\" so called ; this latter building is seen on the left, and is now occupied as a post office ; the projection in front is a modern addition. This was the building in which Gov. Trumbull transacted his public business during the Revolution. In those days traveling was generally performed on horseback ; the marks of the spurs of the horsemen, expresses, &c. are still seen on the side of the counter on which they sat, while waiting the Governor's orders. The Trumbull house is quite an ancient building. It is the house in which Colonel Trumbull, the painter, was born, and many distinguished personages the flame \u25a0 the majority made three attempts before they were able to get the building. At this period party spirit raged to a great extent. Col. Tilden, one of the majority, was removed from'the public offices which he held, on account of the part he took in the controversy. The majority erected the present Baptist church, about 300 rods north of the brick church. Baptist clergymen were invited into the place to preach for them, and the Baptist society is now the largest in the place. The Legislature, who favored the views of the minority, granted them a lottery, in order to erect a church. The opposite party were fully of the opinion lhat the Legislature improperly interfered in the concerns osthe society."], [338, "320 LEBANON. \" War Office\" and Gov. Trumbull' s House, Lebanon. have been within its walls. Gen. Washington, Dr. Franklin, Jeffer son, Rochambeau and La Fayette, have all, it is believed, been lodged in this house. The Governor generally had a guard of about half a dozen men to protect his person, as there was some danger at that pe riod of being seized in the night season and carried off to the enemy. Some alarm was caused at one time by a traveler coming into the house, in 'the garb of a beggar, and insisting upon seeing the Governor, who at that time was unwell. Mrs. Hyde, his housekeeper, not liking his appearance and actions, seizing the shovel and tongs, drove him out of the house, and called the guard, who came to her assistance, but the beggar was no where to be found. This town rendered most efficient aid to the American cause during the Revolution ; upwards of 500 men from this town alone (which then included Columbia and a small part of Hebron) were in the army at one time. \u2014 De Lauzun's legion, consisting of about 500 horsemen, win tered here ; their encampment was a little west of the church. Rocham beau with five regiments stayed here about three weeks, and while here Gen. Washington arrived, stayed three days, and reviewed the French troops, who were under the most perfect discipline. While the French were here one of their number was shot for desertion. The court mar tial was held in the guard house, after 9 o'clock at night, and the soldier executed before day. It is supposed that they were fearful, that if Gov. Trumbull came to the knowledge of the soldier's being condemned to death, he would endeavor to save his life. The town of Lebanon originally consisted of a number of pieces of land, purchased by different persons at different times, but afterwards united into one town. There were four proprieties ; the first was a pur chase of five miles in length and three in width, extending from Wind ham line on the northeast part, southwesterly to the bounds of Hebron and Colchester. This tract was purchased of Owanecho, sachem of the Mohegans. The grant was dated 1698, and is called the five mile purchase. The second propriety was a tract of five miles in length and one in breadth, lying south and adjoining the five mile purchase. It was a grant made by Owanecho to the Rev. Mr. Fitch and the fa-"], [339, "321 LEBANON. mous Major John Mason. This grant was made in 1G95. The third propriety was called the Clark and Dewey purchase, from the names of the first owners and settlers. This tract was obtained in 1706; it was of a triangular form, leaving a small gore between the five' mile purchase and the Windham bounds. This gore was the fourth pro priety. It was about half a mile in length, and from ten to uvo hun dred rods in width, and called the Whiting purchase. These different tracts of land were united by agreement among the planters, about the year 1700. The settlers on the one mile propriety wished, for the convenience of public worship, to join those of the five mile purchase, and it was agreed that the meeting house should be pla ced on the center line of the two tracts, north and south ; other parts of the town also united with them. The first clergyman ordained in the town was the Rev. Joseph Parsons, who was ordained or installed here in November, 1700. \" Jonathan Trumbull, governor of Connecticut, was a descendant from the early settlers of New England. Two brothers of the name came from the west of England into the Massachusetts colony. The one fixed at Charlestown, the other at Ipswich. The father of Gov, Trumbull was a substantial farmer, in the town of Lebanon, Conn. When he was a young man he went to this place, and was one of the first settlers, in the year 1700. He emigrated from Westfield in the county of Hampshire, where his father had removed from Ipswich, who was among the most respectable osthe yeomanry. The Governor was born at Lebanon, in 1710. In the year 1723, he entered Harvard Col lege. He early discovered fine talents and a most amiable disposition. He was a modest, ingenuous youth, very bashful when he first entered college, owing to his tender years, as well as retired situation ; but he was much beloved by bis classmates, and when he took his degree, one osthe finest scholars, with such accomplishments as qualified him to be useful, as well as to make tbe most conspicuous figure. He was fond of the study of divinity, and for some years was a preacher of the gospel ; he then turned his attention to jurisprudence, and soon became an emi nent civilian. It is an observation of Mr. Hutchinson, ' that many of the first characters in Massachusetts, were at first probationers for the ministry, and afterwards made a figure at the bar, or in the legislative or executive courts osthe province.' We recollect the names osStough ton, Read, Gridley, and judge Stephen Sewall. That gentleman adds, when persons have been ordained, they ought ' to have very special reasons to leave the profession for a civil employment.' We have seen an instance of this in Gov. Saltonstall, where the public was much bene fitted. \"Gov. Trumbull was employed in many civil offices, all of which he executed with great fidelity, and grew in the esteem of the people as he advanced in years. He was an active man in public life 51 years, 15 of which he was governor of Connecticut colony. When he first went into this office it required a man of prudence, firmness, consistency and ability to manage affairs. A good pilot is necessary for every bark 41"], [340, "322 LEBANON. which sails on the tempestuous sea. In Connecticut the appearance was more tranquil than the neighboring province, but the clouds were gathering which soon darkened \"the face of the couutry. Gov. Trum bull saw the storm burst upon Massachusetts in 1775 ; he lived to see the auspicious day, also, when his country enjoyed the blessings of peace, and the glory of her independence. No man could guide the vessel of state with more care. No man ever loved his country more. During the whole American war, he showed himself the honest and un shaken patriot, the wise and able magistrate. In an excellent speech he made to the General Assembly, October, 1783, he thus expressed himself, ' I have to request the favor of you, gentlemen, and through you of all the freemen of the state, that after May next, I may be ex cused from any further service in public life, and from this time I may no longer be considered as an object for your suffrages for any public employment. The reasonableness of the request I am persuaded will be questioned by no one. The length of time I have devoted to their service, with my declining state of vigor and activity, will I please my self form forme a sufficient and unfailing excuse with my fellow citizens.' \"This excellent man departed this life on the 17th (?) of August, 1785. at his seat in Lebanon, in the 75th year of his age. His father had lived the same number of years. \" Gov. Trumbull made a great collection of papers, manuscripts, &.c. which were presented by the family to the Massachusetts Historical So ciety ; several of them have been printed in the volumes of their col lections.\"* Jonathan Trumbull, LL. D., a son of the preceding governor, was educated at Harvard College, \" where he graduated, having gone through with the usual course of collegiate studies with unusual repu tation. In 1775, at the commencement of the Revolutionary war, he was appointed by Congress paymaster in the northern department, and soon after secretary and aid to General Washington. He was for sev eral years a member osthe State legislature, and Speaker of the House. In 1790, he was chosen a representative in Congress from this State ; and in 1791, he was appointed Speaker of the House of Representa tives, in which situation he continued until 1794, when he was elected a Senator in the Senate osthe United States. In 1796, he was chosen by the freemen lieutenant governor of the State, and in 1798, governor. He was annually re-elected to this office for eleven years in succession, and until his death, in 1809. He was 69 years of a^e. Governor liumbull was a man of handsome talents, of very respectable acquire ments, of amiable manners, and was distinguished for his social virtues. The confidence of his fellow citizens, which he so long enjoyed in a very eminent degree, affords the most satisfactory evidence of hi's talents and virtues.\"! Guilford Dudley Young was a native of this town. In the last war with Great Britain, he was a major, and afterwards a colonel in the U. S. army. On the 23d of October, 1812, with a small detachment Elliot's Eiographical Dictionary. t Pease and Niles' Gazetteer."], [341, "323 LEBANON. of militia, Major Young surprised a party of the enemy at St. Regis, captured the two captains, 1 lieutenant, 2 sergeants, 35 privates, and brought off one stand of colors, the first taken from the enemy during the war. This officer, after the war, entered the Patriot service, under Gen. Mina, and lost his life in the struggle for Mexican independence, in 1817. The Patriots, 269 in number, had possession of a small fort, which was invested by a Royalist force of 3500 men. The supplies of provision and water being cut off, the sufferings of the garrison, and women and children in the fort, became intolerable ; many of the soldiers deserted, so that not more than 150 effective men remained. Colonel Young, however, knowing the perfidy osthe enemy, determined to defend the fort to the last. After having bravely defeated the enemy in a number of their endeavors to carry the fort by storm, Col. Young was killed by a cannon shot from the battery raised against the fort. \" On the enemy's last retreat, the Colonel, anxious to observe all their movements, fearlessly exposed his person, by stepping on a large stone on the ramparts; and, while conversing with Dr. Hennessey on the successes of the day, and on the dastardly conduct of the enemy, the last shot that was fired from their battery carried off his head. Colonel Young was an officer whom, next to Mina, the American part osthe division had been accustomed to respect and admire. In every action, he had been conspicuous for his daring courage and skill. Mina reposed unbounded confidence in him. In the hour of danger he was collected, gave his orders with precision, and, sword in hand, was always in the hottest of the combat. Honor and firmness marked all his actions. He was generous in the extreme, and endured privations with a cheer fulness superior to that of any other officer in the division. He had been in the United States' service, as lieutenant colonel of the twenty ninth regiment of infantry. His body was interred by the few Ameri cans who could be spared from duty, with every possible mark of honor and respect ; and the general gloom which pervaded the division on this occasion, was the sincerest tribute that could be offered by them to the memory of their brave chief.\"* The Rev. James Fitch, the first minister in Norwich, died at Leba non, in the 80th year of his age. It appears that there were two brothers, Thomas and James Fitch, or, in the ancient way of writing the name, Fytche, who came from Bocking in the county of Essex, England, to America, in 1638. Thomas settled at Norwalk, and was father of Thomas Fitch, governor of the colony of Connecticut. The Rev. James Fitch married for his first wife a daughter of the Rev. Henry Whitfield, of Guilford. His second wife was Priscilla Mason, daughter of Major John Mason, the celebrated commander of the expe dition against the Pequots. f By his two wives he had fourteen chil dren ; all except one lived to have families of children.

LEDYARD. Ledyard, formerly North Groton, the north part of Groton, was in corporated as a town in 1836. It is about six miles square, bounded n. by Preston, e. by North Stonington and Stonington, s. by Groton, and w. by Thames river, separating it from Montville. The central part osthe town is 7\u00a3 miles from New London, and ~l\\ from Norwich. It is estimated that the population is about 2,000. The inhabitants are principally farmers. The principal village in the town, is at Gale's ferry, which may consist of about thirty dwelling houses, and is about 7 miles from New London. A remnant of the Pequot tribe, consisting of about twenty persons, still remain in the northeast section osthe town. This town derived its name from Col. Ledyard, and his relative, John Ledyard, the celebrated traveler, who was a native of Groton, which at"], [344, "326 LEDYARD. that time included this town within its limits. The following account of his life is from Allen's American Biographical Dictionary. \" John Ledyard, a distinguished traveler, was a native of Groton in Connecticut. His father died while he was yet a child, and he was left under the care of a relative in Hartford. Here he enjoyed the ad vantages of a grammar school. After the death of his patron, when he was eighteen years of age, he was left to follow his own inclinations. With a view to the study of divinity he now passed a short time in Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where he had an opportunity of learning the manners of the Indians, as there was a number of Indian pupils in the seminary. His acquaintance with the savage character gained in this place, was of no little advantage to him in the suture pe riods of his life. His poverty obliging him to withdraw from the Col lege before he had completed his education, and not having a shilling in his pocket to defray the expense of a journey to Hartford, he built him a canoe, fifty feet in length, and three in breadth, and being gen erously supplied with some dried venison for his sea stores, he em barked upon the Connecticut, and going down that river, which is in many places rapid, and with which he was totally unacquainted, he ar rived safely at Hartford, at the distance of one hundred and forty miles. \" He soon went to New York, and sailed for London in 1771, as a common sailor. When Captain Cook sailed on his third voyage of discovery, Ledyard, who felt an irresistible desire to explore those regions of the globe which w-ere yet undiscovered or imperfectly known, accepted the humble station of corporal of marines, rather than forego an opportunity so inviting to his inquisitive and adventurous spirit. He was a favorite osthe illustrious navigator, and was one osthe witnesses of his tragical end in 1778. He surprised his friends in America, who had heard nothing of him for ten years, by a visit in 1781. Having offered his services to several merchants to conduct a trading voyage to the northwest coast and meeting with no encouragement, he again embarked for England in 1782. He now resolved to traverse the continent of America from the northwest coast, which Cook had partly explored, to the eastern coast, with which he was already perfectly familiar. Disappointed in his intention of sailing on a voyage of commercial adventure to Nootka sound, he passed the British channel to Ostend, with only ten guineas in his purse, determined to travel over land roKamschatka, whencethe passage is short to the western coast of America. When he eame to the gulf of Bothnia, he attempted to cross the ice, that he might reach Kam sehatka by the shortest way ; but finding that the water was not frozen in the middle, he returned to Stockholm. He then traveled northward into the arctic circle; and passing round the head of the gulf, descended on its eastern side to Petersburgh. There his extraordinary appearance attracted general notice. Without stockings or shoes, and too poor to provide himself with either, he was invited to dine with the Portuguese ambassador, who supplied him wilh twenty guineas on the credit of Sir Joseph Banks. Through his interest, he also obtained permission to accompany a detachment of stores, which was to be sent to Yakutz for the use of Mr. Billings, an Englishman, who was intrusted with the schemes of northern discovery, in which the Empress was then engaged. From Yakutz, which is situated in Siberia, six thou sand miles east of Petersburgh, he proceeded to Oczakow, or Ocholsk, on the Kam schatkan sea but as the navigation was completely obstructed by ice, he returned to Yakutz, intending to wait for the conclusion osthe winter. Here, in consequence of some unaccountable suspicion, he was seized in the name of the Empress by two Rus sian soldiers, who conveyed him, in the depth of winter, through the north of Tartary o the frontier osthe Polish dominions, assuring him at their departure, that if he re turned lo Russia, he should certainly be hanged, but if he chose so return to England they wished him a peasant journey. Poor, forlorn, and friendless, covered with rags and exhausted by fatigue, disease and misery, he proceeded to Konigsberg, where tie oTwhich aS^EnSa^bled \u00bb \u25a0\"\u00ab\u25a0 *\u2122 of *\u00ab **>\u00a3 * -ans \"He immediately waited on Sir Joseph, who recommended him to an adventure as perilous as that from which he had just returned.

Sparrman.Paterson and Vail lant had traveled into Caflraria, and Norden and Bruce had enlarged the acquaint ance of Europeans with Egypt, Nubia and Abyssinia. In regard to other parts of this quarter of the globe, ils geography, excepting in relation to its coasts, was in volved in darkness. Ledyard engaged with enthusiasm in an enterprise which he had already projected for himself: and receiving from Sir Joseph a letter of intro duction to one of the members of the committee appointed to direct the business, and promote ihe object of the association, he went to him without delay. The descrip tion which lhat gentleman bas given of his first interview, strongly marks the charac ter of this hardy traveler. ' Before I had learned,' says he, ' from the note the name and business of my visitor, I was struck with the manliness of his person, the breadth of his chest, the openness of his countenance, and the inquietude of his eye. I spread the map of Africa before him, and tracing a line from Cairo to Sennaar, and from thence westward in the latitude and supposed direction of the Niger, I told him that was the route, by which I was anxious that Africa might, if possible be explored. He said, he should think himself singularly fortunate to be entrusted with the adventure. I asked him when he would set out ? To-morrow morning, was his answer.' \" From such zeal, decision and intrepidity, the society naturally formed the mosi sanguine expectations. He sailed from London, June 30, 1788, and in thirty six days, seven of which were spent in Paris, and two at Marseilles, arrived in the city of Al- exandria; and having there assumed the dress of an Egyptian traveler, proceeded to Cairo, which he reached on the nineteenth of August. He traveled with peculiar advantages. Endowed with an original and comprehensive genius, he beheld with interest, and described with energy, the scenes and objects around him ; and by com paring them with what he had seen in other regions of the globe, he was enabled to give his narrative all the varied effect of contrast and resemblance. His remarks on Lower Egypt, had that country been less generally known, might have ranked with the most valuable of geographical records. They greatly heightened the opinion which his employers already entertained, of his singular qualifications for ihe task which he bad undertaken. Nor was his residence at Cairo altogether useless to the association. By visiting the slave markets, and by conversing with the Jelabs, or traveling mer chants osthe caravans, he obtained, without any expense, a better idea of the people of Africa, of its trade, osthe position of places, the nature osthe country, and the man ner of traveling, than he could by any other means have acquired ; and the communi cations on these subjects, which he transmitted to England, interesting and instructive as they were, afforded the society the most gratifying proofs of the ardent spirit of enquiry, the unwearied atlention, the persevering research, and the laborious, inde fatigable, anxious zeal, with which their author pursued the object of his mission. \" He had announced to his employers, that he had received lelteK of earnest re- commendation from the Aga ; that the day of his departure was appointed ; that his next dispatch would be dated from Sennaar; and the committee expected with im- patience the result of his journey. But that journey was never to be performed. The vexation occasioned by repeated delays in the departure osthe caravan, brought on a bilious complaint, which being increased at first by incautious treatment, baffled the skill of the most approved physicians of Cairo, and terminated his earthly existence, January 17, 1789. \"The society heard with deep concern the death ofa man, whose high sense ofhonor, magnanimous contempt ofdanger, and earnest zeal for the extension of knowledge, had been so conspicuously displayed in their service ; whose ardor, tempered by calm deliberation, whose daring spirit, seconded by the most prudent caution, and whose im- patience of control, united with the power of supporting any fatigue, seemed to have qualified him above all other men, for the very arduous task of traversing the wildest and most dangerous part of the continent of Africa. Despising the accidental dis- tinctions of society, he seemed to regard no man as his superior; but his manners, though unpolished, were not disagreeable. His uncultivated genius was peculiar and capacious. The hardships to which hesnbmitled in the prosecution of his enterprises and in the indulgence of his curiosity, are almost incredible. He was sometimes glad to receive food as in charity to a madman, for that character he hud been obliged to assume in order to avoid a heavier calamity. His judgment osthe female charac- ter is very honorable lo the sex. ' I have always remarked,' says he, ' that women in all countries are civil and obliging, tender and humane : that they are ever inclined to be gav and cheerful, timorous and modest; and that they do not hesilate, like men, lo perform a generous action. Not haughty, nor arrogant, nor supercilious, they are full of courtesy, and fond of society; more liable in general to err than man, but in general also more virtuous, and performing more good actions, than he.

Lisbon was formerly included within the limits of Norwich. It was incorporated as a distinct town in 1786. It is a small irregular town ship, being the point of land between the Quinnebaug and Shetucket rivers, which unite at the southern point of the town. It is bounded north by Windham and Canterbury, westwardly by the Shetucket, sep arating it from Norwich and Franklin, and eastwardly by the Quinne baug, dividing it from Griswold and Preston. The township is uneven and hilly. The prevailing character of the soil is a gravelly loam, occasionally interspersed with a sandy loam, espe cially in the valleys, and it is considerably fertile and productive. There are small intervals or tracts of alluvial soil upon the borders of the riv er. The inhabitants are generally farmers, who are mostly in good circumstances. The township is divided into two parishes, Newent and Hanover, having a Congregational church in each place. There is a woolen and silk factory in the society of Hanover, the north part of the town. Lisbon appears to have remained stationary in regard to the number of its inhabitants, for a considerable period. In 1800 the population was 1,158; in 1810, it was reduced to 1,128. In 1830, the number was 1,161. The central part of the town is seven miles from Norwich, and forty five s. e. from Hartford. LYME. Lyme was first settled about 1664. Its first English name was East Saybrook, being then a part of the town of Saybrook. It was incor porated as a distinct town, by the name of Lyme, in 1667. The In dian name for the eastern part of the town was Nehantic. It is bounded north by East Haddam and Salem, west by Connecticut river, dividing it from Saybrook, east by Waterford and Montville, and south by Long Island sound. The township comprises an area of about 80 square miles, being 10 miles long from north to south, and 8 broad. \" From Nehantic river, four miles westward, a tract extending from the Sound to the northern boundary of Lyme and New London was re served for the Indians, when those townships were incorporated. Some time afterward, the inhabitants of both united in a petition to the Le gislature, to include these lands within their limits. The Legislature granted the petition, without determining upon the dividing line. New"], [347, "329 LYME London proposed to take three miles in width, and leave one to Lyme. Lyme made a similar proposal to New London. The distance to the seat of government was fifty miles. The journey lay through a wil derness inhabited by savages, and crossed by numerous streams, over which no bridges were erected. The land, though now of considerable value, was then regarded as a trifling object. The expense of appoint ing agents to manage the cause before the Legislature was considerable, and the hazard of the journey not small. In this situation, the inhabi tants of both townships agreed to settle their respective titles to the land in controversy, by a combat between two champions to be chosen by each for that purpose. New London selected two men by the names of Picket and Latimer. Lyme committed its cause to two others, na med Griswold and Ely. On a day mutually appointed, the champions appeared in the field, and sought with their fists, till victory declared in favor of each of the Lyme combatants. Lyme then quietly took possession of the controverted tract, and has held it undisputed to the present day.\"* The above shows the appearance of the Congregational church in Lyme, and the buildings in the vicinity. The village is situated on a plain, about half a mile or more back from Connecticut river, on a street running parallel to it. The elevated ground seen in the distance is one of the Church Hills, so called probably from the circumstance of the first church having been built near the summit of one of these elevations, upwards of half a mile eastward of the present church. This part of Lyme is 15 miles from New London, and 40 from Hartford. There are 6 bouses of worship, 4 Congregational, and 2 Baptist. There are 4 post offices in the town, viz. Lyme, Hamburg, North Lyme, and East Lyme. There are 1 cotton and 2 woolen factories. * Dr. Dwighl's Travels, Vol. 2. 42"], [348, "330 LYME The surface of the town is strikingly diversified. About one half of it is level, or moderately hilly, comprising the borders of the Sound, its bays and inlets, the large tracts of salt marsh, the numerous and ex tensive intervals on the rivers and other sections. The other division of the township is stony and mountainous. Near the mouth of Four mile river, several distinct ridges commence, consisting of a succession of hills, which range northwardly, and become more elevated as they extend into the interior. Within this town, north of Eight mile river, near the Connecticut river, commences one of the branches of granitic mountains, which extends northwardly through the state into Massa chusetts, and constitutes the height of land which divides the waters that run westwardly into the Connecticut, from those that run into the Thames and other streams. The bodies of salt marsh and meadows upon the rivers are extensive and productive, the former affording large quantities of salt hay, and the latter producing fresh hay, grain, &c. The hilly and mountainous parts of the town do not admit of a general cultivation of grain, but afford good grazing. South vieiv of the Gov. Griswold House, in Lyme. The above is a representation of tbe house erected by Roger Gris wold, the last governor osthe name, now in possession of Mr. Matthew Griswold. Being near the sea shore, it commands an extensive and delightful prospect of the Sound. It is about three miles s. e. of the Congregational church in Lyme, in Black Hall, a place which ever has been in the possession of the Griswold family, since the first settle ment of Lyme. Matthew Griswold, the ancestor of the present Gris wolds, appears to have been one of tbe first settlers of Lyme ; he had also three brothers, who came over from England, Thomas, John, and George Thomas settled at Windsor, John at Wethersfield, and George at Saybrook. The following was extracted from a manuscript in the family Bible of Judge Griswold. \u00ab Matthew first went to Windsor married Annah Wolcott, daughter of the first Henry Wolcott, and was"], [349, "331 LYME by trade a stone cutter ; he made a stone table now standing over the grave of his father-in-law, the letters of which were cut deep, are now wholly obliterated.* Before Major Fenwick left Saybrook, he, (Fen wick.) committed all his public as well as his private concerns to said Matthew Griswold. Matthew Griswold was the first Commissioner, or Justice of the Peace, in Saybrook. The town of Saybrook formerly contained the lands now lying in Lyme. Soon after the settlement of all the concerns of said Fenwick, Matthew Griswold removed to Black Hall, lying on the east side of Connecticut river, in the town of Lyme, (that being named after the native town of said Griswold, viz. Lyme Regis.) Black Hall took its name from the circumstance of said Gris wold's building a log hut on his farm in Lyme, where he had an old negro, who used to sleep there before any white person had dared to spend a night on the east side of Connecticut river, for fear of the In dians. It was called the Black's Hall, and from that took the name of Black Hall. Near the door of said Griswold's he dug a well ; two other houses have been built since the first, and the said well is now used, and ever has been used, by some of his descendants.\" \" Matthew Griswold, the first governor of that name, descended from a reputable family, and was born in Lyme, March 25th, 1714. As he was not favored with a public education, he spent his earliest days in the more retired walks in life. But possessing naturally a strong and in quisitive mind, accompanied with a desire to be useful to mankind, at the age of about twenty five he commenced the study of the law, and by his intense application, without the aid of an instructor, acquired that knowledge of the science of the law which was necessary to enter on his professional employment, and was soon admitted to the bar. In his profession he soon distinguished himself, as an able, upright, and faithful advocate. He served many years as counselor, and also as king's attor ney, with integrity and reputation. On the 11th of November, 1743, he married Miss Ursula Wolcott, daughter osthe Hon. Roger Wolcott, formerly governor of Connecticut. In the year 1751, he was first elected a representative to the General Assembly, and was chosen a number of years successively. In 1755, he was put into nomination for, and in 1759 was elected into the council of the state. In 1766, he was appointed one of the judges of the superior court, and in 1769 was elected lieutenant governor, with which office was connected that of chief justice of the State. In 1784, he was chosen governor, and in 1786 he retired from public life, until the adoption of the Constitu tion osthe United States, by the convention of this state, in 1788, when he was called to officiate as president of that body. In all these various offices, he distinguished himself as a faithful servant of the public. \" But if we descend to the more private walks of life, and view his character as a private citizen, we shall find the social sweetly blended with the christian virtues. He possessed a benevolent disposition, which rendered his deportment truly engaging, in all the domestic relations. * This must be a mistake, or the letters must have been re-cut, as they are very distinct ; \u2014 see account of Windsor, p. 132."], [350, "332 LYME \" Having a frank and an open heart, he was sincere in all his profes- sions of friendship, and consequently enjoyed the confidence and esteem of a numerous and extensive acquaintance. He was truly hospitable, and abounded in acts of charity. The children of want he never sent empty from his door, but guided by a real sympathy, he fed the hun- gry, clothed the naked, and relieved the distressed. He died April 28th, 1799, in the 85th year of his age. \" Roger Griswold, the second governor of that name, was the son of the former governor. He was born at Lyme, May 21, 1762, and edu- cated at Yale College, where he graduated in 1780. In 1783, he commenced the practice of the law, and soon became extensively en- gaged in professional business, and acquired a high reputation as a pro- found lawyer and advocate. In 1789, when he was but thirty two years of age, he was removed from a lucrative and extensive practice to the councils of tbe nation, being elected a representative from this State to the Congress of the United States. \" In 1801, at the close of President Adams' administration, he was nominated to be secretary of war, but declined to accept the office. In 1807, he was appointed a judge osthe superior court; and in 1809, he was elected lieutenant governor, which office he held until the spring of 1811, when the freemen elected him governor. This period, embra- cing the first five months after the declaration of the late war with Great Britain, was one of peculiar excitement and difficulty, and during which he was subject to an occasional severe indisposition. \" He was a member of Congress for ten years, embracing a part of tbe administration of Washington, the whole of that of the elder Adams, and a part of that of Jefferson. This was a very important and inter- esting period, not only from the political events of this country, but from the great convulsions which agitated all Europe ; and it was during this period, while in Congress, that Roger Griswold was most distinguished. During a considerable part of this time, he ranked among tbe first of his party, and was equally distinguished for his powerful talents in debate, and the independence and decision of his conduct. He remained but a short time on the bench of the superior court, and still shorter in the seat of chief magistrate. \"Few men in Connecticut have been more distinguished as lawyers and statesmen than Roger Griswold; and few have been more univer sally esteemed and beloved. He lived in a critical and eventful period of our political existence, and pre-eminently ' acted well his part,' de serving and receiving the highest honors his native state could confer upon him. He died at Norwich, in October, 1812, and his remains were conveyed to Lyme for interment. An eulogy upon his character was delivered before both houses of the legislature, at New Haven, by Hon. David Daggett.\"* The following is from a monument in a kind of family burying ground, in the vicinity of Black Hall. This monument is erected to the memory of his Excellency Roger Griswold, LL. D. late Governor of this otate. He was born at Lyme, May 25th, 1762, and died at * New England Review."], [351, "333 LYME Norwich, Oct. 12th, 1812. He was the son of his Excellency Matthew Griswold, who had been Chief Justice of the Superior Court, Lieut. Governor and Governor. His mother was daughter of Roger Wolcott, Esq. of Windsor, who was for many years Governor of this Stale. Gov. Griswold graduated at Yale College in 1780, and in 1783 entered upon the profession of law. At the age of 34, he was elected into the Council of the United States. In 1807 he was appointed a Judge of the Superior Court. In 1809 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor, and in 1811 was elected Gov ernor. Upon all these eminent stations he conferred dignity and honor, not less conspicuous by honorable parentage and elevated rank in society, than by personal merit, talents and virtues. He was respected in the University, as an elegant and classical scholar. Quick discernment, sound reasoning, legal science, manly elo quence, raised him to the first eminence at the bar. Distinguished in the national councils among the illustrious statesmen of Ihe age \u2014 revered for his inflexible integ rity and pre-eminent talents, his political course was highly honorable. His friends viewed him with virtuous pride, his native state with honest triumph. His fame and honors were the just rewards of noble actions, and of a life devoted to his country. He was endeared to his family by fidelity and affection, to his neighbors by frankness and benevolence. His memory is embalmed in the hearts of surviving relatives and of a grateful people. When this monument shall have decayed, his name will be en rolled with honor among the great, the wise, and the good.

On the foot stone, R. M. Oct. 18, 1737. Deacon Marvin appears to have been remarkable for his eccentricity in almost all his transactions in life. His courtship, it is said, was as follows : \u2014 Having one day mounted his horse, with only a sheep-skin for a saddle, he rode in front of the house where Sarah or Betty Lee lived, and without dismounting, requested Betty to come to him ; on her com- ing, he told her that the Lord had sent him there to marry her. With- out much hesitation, she replied, the Lord's will be done. During his whole life, he professed to be governed much by divine communications that were made to him. Once he said, that the Lord had directed him to distribute his cows among his poor neighbors. After the distribution had been going on for some time, a certain man, searing that none might fall to himself, went to the deacon, and told him that he had received a communication from the Lord, saying that the Lord had directed him to the deacon for a cow. Well, says the deacon, you shall receive it. What cow did the Lord say should be given you, a new milch or far- row ? A new milch cow, was the reply. Well, says the deacon, your communication could not be from the Lord, for 1 have already given away all my new milch cows. He was, it is said, the greatest land pro prietor of any man in the vicinity, and of regular standing in the church, being remarkably exemplary. He was also a military captain, as stated in his epitaph."], [352, "334 MONTVILLE. Lyme, March 17, 1774. Yesterday, one William Lamson, of Martha's Vineyard, came to this town with a bag of tea, (about 100 wt.) on horseback, which he was peddling about the country. It appeared that he was about business which he supposed would render him obnox ious to the people, which gave reason to suspect that he had some ot the detestawe tea lately landed at Cape Cod ; and upon examination it appeared to the satisfaction oi all present, to be part of that very tea, (though he declared that he purchased it of two gentlemen in Newport: one of them 'tis said is a custom house officer, and the otfier Captain of the fort.) Whereupon a number of the sons of liberty assembled in the evening, kindled a fire, and committed its contents to the flames, where it was all con sumed and the ashes buried on ihe spot, in testimony of their utter abhorrence of all tea subject to a duty for the purpose of raising a revenue in America\u2014 a laudable ex ample for our brethren in Connecticut.\u2014 Conn. Jour. March 25, 1 i 14. Lyme, Dec. 6, 1781. LastFriday, a guard under the command of Ensign Andrew Griswold, stationed at Lyme, discovered a whale boat in a fresh pond near Black Point ; and suspecting it came from Long Island, they set a guard ol five men over the boat; and the night after four others of the guard with Ensign Griswold, went towards the house of the noted Elisha Beckwith ; one of the party named Noah Lester, advanced faster than Ihe rest, and was challenged by Beckwith's wife, who was near the house; this alarmed ten men who were in the house, well armed, and they immediately seized upon and made prisoner of Lester, and carried him into the house. Soon after the other four of the guard came to the house, (not knowing Lester was a prisoner,) and went directly in ; where they discovered the ten persons in arms : a scuffle immediately ensued between them; and after some lime the guard secured six of the party, among whom was Eli sha Beckwith: the other four made their escape into the woods, but they all except one were taken the next day. They came in the above boat from Long Island, and were under the command of Thomas Smith, formerly of Middletown, who had a Captain's commission under the British king. Elisha Beckwith went off with the enemy the 6th Sept. last, when they made their descent on this place. The above cul prits are secured in Norwich gaol. MONTVILLE. Montville originally belonged to New London. It was incor porated as a distinct town in 1786. It is bounded north by Bozrah and Norwich, west by Salem and Lyme, east by the river Thames, and south by Waterford. Its length from east to west is about eight miles, and its breadth averages about five miles. This township is em braced within the granitic district, bordering on the sea coast, and is uneven, being hilly and stony. The soil is a coarse, dry, gravelly loam, considerably strong and fertile, affording good grazing. The road from New London to Norwich passes through this town ; it is a turnpike, and is said to be the first which was ever made in the United States. \" The former road was perfectly fitted to force upon the public mind the utility of turnpike roads. As New London is the port of entry for Norwich, the merchants of Norwich must often visit it upon business ; and tbe convenience of dispatch in cases of business I need not explain. Yet few persons formerly attempted to go from one of these places to the other, and return the same day. Pleasure carriages on this road were scarcely used at all. The new road is smooth and good ; and the journey is now easily performed in little more than two hours. These towns, therefore, may be regarded as having been brought nearer to each other more than half a day's journey.\""], [353, "335 MONTVILLE. There are 2 post offices in this town, the Montville and Uncasville post offices. Uncasville post office is in the southern section of the town. The central part of the town is about 8 miles from New Lon don. Chesterfield is a parish in the southeastern section of the town. There are 3 cotton, 2 woolen factories, and an oil mill, in the limits of the town. There are five houses for public worship within the limits osthe township, 2 for Congregationalists, 2 for Baptists, and one in the Mohegan reservation ; a tract of land reserved by the state for the maintenance of this tribe of Indians, a remnant of which still remain in this town, \" on the land of their fathers.\" It appears from the most authentic information which can now be obtained, that, at the time of the first settlement of Connecticut, Uncas, the Mohegan sagamore, had under him between four and five hundred warriors. Allowing the proportion osthe warriors to the whole number of inhabitants to have been as three to ten, the Mohegan tribe must have consisted of nearly 1700 people. The Pequot and Mohegan country lay to tbe south and east of the Nehantic, (in Lyme,) from Connecticut river to the Rhode Island line on the east, and extended northward to near the northern boundary of the state. This tract was nearly thirty miles square, and included the counties of New London, Windham, and the principal part of the county of Tolland. Historians, (says Dr. Holmes,) have treated the Pequots and Mohegans as two different tribes ; and have described the Pequot country as lying principally within the three towns of New Lon don, Groton, and Stonington. All the tract north and east, as has been described, they have represented as the Mohegan country. Most if not all the towns in this tract hold their lands by virtue of deeds from Uncas, or his successors, the Mohegan sachems. Dr. Trumbull, however, thinks it doubtful whether the Mohegans were a distinct nation from the Pe quots. \" They appear to have been a part of the same nation, named from the place of their situation. Uncas was a Pequot by birth, and of the royal line, both by his father and mother ; and his wife was a daughter of Tatobam, one of the Pequot sachems. He appears to have been a captain, or petty sachem, under Sassacus, the great prince of the nation. When the English first came into Connecticut, he was in a state of rebellion against him, in consequence of some misunder standing between them ; and his power and influence among the Indi ans were inconsiderable. Having revolted from his tribe, he was ex- pelled his country. \" In 1637, when the English conquered the Pequots, Uncas readily joined them to save himself, and be avenged on his warlike adversary. After this period, Uncas was the most powerful sachem in tbe state. Part osthe miserable remnant osthe Pe quots fell to the lot osthe Mohegans, and became subject to the government of Uncas. He seems, however, to have swayed the scepter with a heavy hand ; for the Pequots withdrew themselves from his dominion, and the commissioners found it necessary to fine him, and repeatedly to admonish him for his tyranny. He was however a brave warrior, and formidable to his enemies ; on the murder of one of his principal Indians, by some of the men of Sequassen, a sachem on Connecticut river, he demanded satis faction of him. It was refused. Uncas and Sequassen sought. Sequassen was over come. Uncas killed a number of his men, and burned his wigwams. Sequassen appears to have been a sachem under the influence of Miantonimoh, the chief sacbem of the Narragansetts. After the destruction of the Pequots, Miantonimoh attempted"], [354, "336 MONTVILLE. to set up as a kind of universal sachem over all the Indians in New England. The old grudge and hatred which had subsisted between him and the Pequots, he^now transferred to Uncas and the Mohegans. Without any regard to the league made De- tween him, the English, and the Mohegans, at Hartford, in 1638 when the j-equots were divided between him and Uncas, he practiced murder and war against him. After the defeat of Sequassen, Miantonimoh, with 900 or 1000 men, marched against Uncas. These hostile chiefs met on Sachem's Plain, in the east part ol the town ot Norwich ; Miantonimoh was defeated, taken prisoner, and some time after was put to death. Uncas appears to have pushed his conquests, m different directions, beyond Connecticut river. About 1654, he had a quarrel with An hamamet, sachem of Mus- sauco, or Massacoe, (Simsbury,) which brought on a war. Uncas sent one of his warriors to take and burn an out wigwam in the night, kill and burn, and leave the marks of the Mohawks. His orders were executed. Arrhainamet, supposing the Mohawks had done the mischief, went in search of them to the northwest. Uncas gained time to equip his men, and afterwards subjugated Arrhamamet. Podunk, near Hartford, was ever afterwards tributary to Uncas.\"* On the conquest osthe Pequots, the Mohegans claimed most of the Pequot country as their hereditary right ; they also laid claim to the Wabbequasset territory by virtue of conquest. This last named territory was conquered from the Nipmuck Indians, whose principal seat was about the great ponds in Oxford, in Massachusetts, but their territory extended southward into Connecticut, more than twenty miles. This was called the Wabbequasset and Whetstone country. The original Mohegan country was surveyed in 1705, and a map of it drawn. The occasion of this survey was a claim, brought forward in 1704, by Owaneco, the son of Uncas, to certain lands in Connecticut! The Masons and others preferred a petition and complaint to Queen Anne, in favor of the Mohegan Indians. The Masons claimed the lands purchased by their ancestor, deputy governor John Mason, in virtue of a deed given to him by Uncas in 1659, while he acted as agent of the colony; and denied the legality of his surrender of them to the colony, in the General Assemblj', the next year. They insisted that it respected nothing more than the jurisdiction right, and that the title to the soil was vested in their family as guardians and overseers of the Indians. This celebrated \" Mohegan case\" was kept in agitation for nearly twenty years. It was al ways, on a legal hearing, determined in favor of the colony. The final decision was by king George III. in council, just before the Revolutionary war. Uncas appeared at the first very unfriendly to the Christian religion. The commissioners of the colonies endeavored to reclaim him. In 1672, they wrote a letter to him \" to incurrage him to attend on the ministry.\" Whatever effect this letter may have had on his outward deportment it seems not to have reached his heart. In 1674, the Rev. Mr. Fitch, of Norwich, mentioned him as manifesting some respect to the Christian ministry, but with an entire distrust of his sincerity. About two years afterwards, however, a providential event made such an impression on the mind of this pagan chieftain, as gave this pious minister some hopes of his real conversion to Christianity. \" In the summer of 1676, there was a great drought in New England, which was extremely severe at Mohegan, and in the neighboring country. In August the corn dried up ; the fruit and leaves fell off as in autumn ; and some trees appeared to be dead. The Indians came from Mohe gan to Norwich, and lamented that they had no rain, and that their powwows could get none in their way of worship ; they desired Mr. Fitch that he would seek God for rain. He appointed a fast day for that purpose. The day proved clear, but at sunset, at the close osthe service, some clouds arose. The next day was cloudy. Uncas went to the house of Mr. Fitch, with many Indians, and lamented the great want of rain. If God shall send you rain, said Mr. Fitch, will you not at tribute it to your powwows ? He answered, no ; for we have done our * President Stiles' Itinerary."], [355, "337 MONTVILLE. utmost but all in vain. If you will declare it before all these Indians, replied the minister, you shall see what God will do for us ; remarking at the same time, their repeated and unfailing reception of rain, in an swer to fasting and prayer. Uncas then ' made a great speech' to the Indians, confessing that if God should then send rain, it could not be ascribed to their powwowing, but must be acknowledged to be an answer to the Englishman's prayer. On that very day the clouds became more extended ; and the day following, there was such a copious rain, that their river rose more than two feet in height.\"* Whether Uncas died in the faith of Christianity, cannot now be ascertained. It is agreeable however to find him acknowledging the God who is above, and paying homage to the religion of his Son. \" The same year (1676) Oneco, a son of Uncas, commanded a party of Mohegans, in an expe dition with Captains Dennison and Avery, against the Narragansetts.\" Ben or Benjamin Uncas appears to have been the last osthe Mohe gans dignified with the title of king. He died suddenly, in May, 1769. He was buried about half a mile south osthe present Mohegan chapel. His son, Isaiah Uncas, was a pupil in Dr. Wheelock's school, at Leba non. He is represented as a corpulent person, of dull intellectual parts, as was his father before him. \" Isaiah died about one year after his father, and the royal line became extinct. The body of king Ben was dug up, and was carried with that of his son, and buried at Norwich. \"f Although there seems to have been considerable pains taken to induce the Mohegans to embrace the gospel, yet these efforts appear to have been attended with but little or no success till about the year 1644, when the zealous Mr. Davenport at that time directed his efforts to wards their conversion. He is said to have been very successful. To the converts gained at this time, Dr. Trumbull probably refers, when he says, \" some few of the Mohegans have professed Christianity, and have been, many years since, admitted to full communion in the north church in New London. About the year 1786, a few Indians went from Mohegan, with Mr. Sampson Occum, the celebrated minister, to the country osthe Oneidas. A considerable number of their brethren emigrated to that country, at the same time, from Farmington, Stonington, Groton, and Nehantic, in the eastern part of Lyme ; and from Charlestown, in Rhode Island. The inducement to this removal, was a tract of excellent wild land given to them by the Oneidas. These emigrants, being most of the scanty remnant of the Muhhekaneok Indians, formerly called \" the seven tribes on the sea coast,\" constitute what are called \" the Bro therton Indians,\" whose entire number, in 1791, was 250, and in 1796, 150 only. On their first emigration, they were under the pastoral care osthe Rev. Mr. Occum.J The Mohesan reservation consists of about 2700 acres. It was holden by them in common till the year 1790, when it was divided to * Hubbard's Indian Wars. + The above information was obtained at Mohegan, in 1834, of Lydia Fowler, an Indian woman, 79 years of age, the oldest person belonging to the tribe. t Holmes' Memoir of the Mohegans. 43"], [356, "338 MONTVILLE. each family by the legislature of Connecticut. The Mohegans are under the care of guardians, or overseers, appointed by the Legislature. A part osthe lands are occupied by the Indians themselves, and a part by white tenants, of which there are as many as Mohegans living on the reservation. The rents go into a common fund, from which the Mohegans derive individually a small sum annually. In 1774, when a census of the inhabitants of Connecticut was taken, there were in the colony 1,363 Indians. The number in the township of New London was stated to be 206. Mohegan was then included in the limits of that town. At the same time there were in Stonington 237; in Groton 186; in Lyme 104; in Norwich 61 ; and in Preston 30 : in all, 824. Most of these may be considered as descended from those who once owed some kind of allegiance to Uncas. Dr. Holmes, who visited Mohegan in 1 803, says that \" there were not more than 80 persons of this tribe remaining, and that John Cooper, the richest man in the tribe, possessing a yoke of oxen and two cows, was then their religious teacher.\" Four years after they were reduced in number to sixty nine, these being for the most part aged persons, widows, and fatherless children. Within the course of a few years past, an effort has been made to elevate and rescue tbe remnant of this tribe from extinction. A small house for divine worship has been erected, and also a house for a teach er ; towards erecting this last building the United States government appropriated 500 dollars ; they have also allowed, recently, 400 dollars annually for the support of a teacher. The school, consisting of up wards of 20 scholars, at this time is under the care of Mr. Anson Glea son, who also officiates as a religious teacher at the Mohegan Chapel. Mr. Gleason commenced his labors among this people in 1832, and it is firmly believed that his efforts to promote the welfare of this people will be attended with lasting and beneficial effects. Mr. Gleason says, \"that he can say for a certainty, that the native children are as apt to learn as any children he ever taught, and bid fair for intelligent men and women.\" He also says, \"This tribe had well nigh run out by in dulging in the use of ardent spirits ; but of late there is a change for the better, a number of reformations having taken place. Most of the youth are opposed to strong drink, and are members of the temperance reform. The greater part of the working men follow the whale trade, and come home only now and then We are on the increase, and hope in the course of a few years, through the mercy of God, to rise in point of vir tue and respectability.\" The Mohegan church is between three and four miles from Norwich city, a few rods east of the public road from Norwich to New London. It is beautifully situated on an eminence commanding a fair view of Norwich at the north, and New London at the south. It was built in 1831, at an expense of between six and seven hundred dollars, con tributed for the purpose mostly by benevolent ladies in the cities of Norwich, Hartford and New London. This house is designed for the use of the Mohegans, and the white inhabitants who reside on the re servation.

Soon after he emerged from pagan darkness he went to live at Lebanon, with Mr. Wheelock, afterwards president of Dart mouth Colleo-e ; in whose family and under whose instruction he con tinued for several years. He afterwards kept a school on Long Island, during some years, and at the same time officiated as public teacher of the Indian tribe at Montauk on that island, till he received ordination by the hands of the Suffolk presbytery. He was afterwards employed"], [358, "340 NORTH STONINGTON. Sampson Occam's house in Mohegan, Montville. on several missions, to various tribes of Indians, -and his services were well received and approved. At his first entrance on the ministry, and for a considerable time after, he was esteemed and respected in his Christian and ministerial character. He was judged to be ' well ac complished, and peculiarly turned to teach and edify his savage breth ren.' Nor was he neglected by the inhabitants of the capital towns. 'Though for many years he was without polite conversation, and desti tute of a library, yet he preached to good acceptance in New York, Boston, and other populous places.' He was said to be an excellent preacher in his own language, and his influence among the Indians was for a long time great. In 1765 or 1766, he accompanied Rev. Mr. Whitaker to London, for the purpose of soliciting benefactions for the support of Mr. Wheelock's school, instituted at Lebanon for the edu cation of Indian youth, to be missionaries and schoolmasters for the na tions of North America. For the last years of his life, Mr. Occum re sided with the Indians at Stockbridge, state of New York, and died July, 1792. The Rev. Mr. Kirkland, missionary to the Oneidas, preached his funeral sermon.\"* The Rev. James Hillhouse, the first minister in this town, was installed in October, 1722.

NORTH STONINGTON. This town was originally a part of Stonington, but was made a dis tinct town in 1808. Its average length from east to west is eight miles, and its breadth about six. It is bounded n. by Preston, Griswold and * Holmes' Memoirs of ihe Mohegans."], [359, "341 NORTH STONINGTON. Voluntown, w. by Ledyard and Preston, e. by Rhode Island, and s. by Stonington. The township is rough, hilly, and abounds with gra nitic rocks. The soil is a gravelly loam, and affords good grazing. It is watered by the Pawcatuck and its branches, which afford sites for mills and other water works. Agriculture is the principal business of the inhabitants. The only village in the town is called Milltown. It consists of between 20 and 30 dwelling houses, five mercantile stores, and two houses of worship ; 1 for Congregationalists, the other for Bap tists. There are also two other Baptist churches in the limits of the town. Milltown is 13 miles from New London, 12\u00a3 from Norwich, 7 from Stonington borough, and 5 from Pawcatuck bridge. Tbe Rev. Joseph Fish appears to have been the first minister in this town ; he was ordained in 1732, it being about this time that the town of Stonington was divided into two societies. About the year 1740 was a period of great religious excitement, and Separate churches were established in the eastern part of Connecticut. In 1742, there was a separation in Stonington, especially from the church under the pastoral care of Mr. Fish. \"Perceiving the errors of his people, and sensible that many of them, not excepting some osthe members of his church, were very ignorant, he took great pains to instruct them, in private as well as public, and to convince them of their errors. But they appeared haughty and self-sufficient, and in their own opinion were much wiser than their teacher, whom they treated with great abuse. They took great offense at a ser- mon he preached from Ephes. v. 1, 'Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear chil- dren.' The principal design of the sermon was to show what it was to follow God, or in what true religion consisted, which was the same thing. It was observed, that fol- lowing God, as dear children, implied men's giving themselves wholly to him, to be governed by his commands; that it implied an imitation of him in his moral perfec- tions, &c. It was insisted, that true religion consisted in thus following God; and that in this we had an infallible rule of trial, whether we were God's children or not. It was inferred, that true religion did not consist in ecstasies, in crying out in the lime of public worship, in powerful impressions, in lively imaginations, or visions of a bleeding Savior, &c; that though the saints might have these things, yet that they were no evidences of a gracious state. On this, the house was filled with outcries against the preacher. He was declared to be an opposer to the work of God, making the hearts of his children sad, and strengthening the hands osthe wicked. From this time, divisions and prejudices sprang up, increased and became settled. Disregard- ing their covenant vows, which they had so lately entered into with their pastor and brethren ; without taking any pains to reform the church, with respect to those things they conceived to be amiss, or without regarding the pains and remonstrances of their pastor and brethren to dissuade them ; a large number finally separated themselves from this and all the standing churches. \" They alledged as reasons for their separation, that the standing churches were not true churches, bui of anti-christ: That hypocrisy was encouraged by them, and they could have no communion with hypocrites. They maintained that the church should be pure, undefiled with hypocrisy, and that no hypocrite should abide with them. Upon this principle the separate churches set out. They publicly professed themselves to be elected of God, given to Christ, and effectually called, and as such, they covenanted together. They maintained that the whole power of ordination was in the church. They objected against their pastor for using notes, and at the same time praying for assistance in preaching. They maintained that God had redeemed their souls, and that they were not bound to rites and forms, but had liberty to worship where they thought fit. They objected, that there was not that liberty in the standing churches, and that food for their souls which they found in the meeting of the brethren. Be- cause ministers studied their sermons, they called their exercises, preaching out of tbe head, and declared that they could not be edified by it. They maintained, that there was no need of any thing more than common learning, to qualify men for ihe minis- try; that if a man had the spirit of God, it was no matter whether he had any learn- ing at all. Indeed, the first separates at Stonington, held to a special revelation of some facts, or future events, not revealed in the scriptures. They elected their first minister by revelation. In less than one year, they chose, ordained, silenced, cast him out osthe church and delivered him up to Satan. \u2014 Trumbull' s Hist. Con. Vol. 2, p. 171."], [360, "342 PRESTON. PRESTON.

Salem, formerly the society of New Salem, the principal part of which was in the bounds of Colchester, was incorporated a town in 1819. It was composed of the south section of Colchester, the north east section of Lyme, and the northern section of Montville. It is bounded n. by Colchester, e. by Bozrah and Montville, s. by Mont ville and Lyme, and w. by East Haddam. It is about six miles long from north to south, and about five broad from east to west. The cen ter of the town is about twenty nine miles southeast from Hartford, and about thirteen miles from New London. The inhabitants are substan tial farmers, who live scattered about on their farms, which are tolerably fertile and productive. There is no place in the town which may be considered as a village. There are three houses of worship in the town, 1 Congregational, 1 Methodist, and 1 Episcopal. STONINGTON. The first person who settled in Stonington was William Cheeseho rough, who removed here from Rehoboth, in Massachusetts, in 1649. It appears that complaints were made against him for trading with the Indians, repairing their arms, &ic. which practices endangered the pub lic safety. He was summoned before the General Court of Connecti cut, who, declaring they had a clear title to those lands, reprimanded him for settling on them without their authority, and for his unlawful trading with the Indians. After giving bonds for his good conduct, he was allowed to continue upon the lands. The court promised him, that if he would procure a sufficient number of planters, they would give them all proper encouragement in making a permanent settlement. About 10 or 12 families, in 1658, made settlements in this quarter; and finding there was a controversy-between Connecticut and Massachu setts with respect to the title and jurisdiction, they, on the 30th of June, entered into a voluntary compact to govern themselves, and con duct their affairs in peace, until it should be determined to whose juris-"], [362, "344 STONINGTON. diction they should submit. The principal planters were George Den nison, Thomas Stanton, Thomas Shaw, William, Elisha, and Samuel Cheeseborough, Moses and Walter Palmer. These, with some others, were signers of the voluntary compact.* The first settlement was made at Wequetequock cove, a little more than two miles n. e. of Stonington borough. Cheeseborough, or Cheesebro, and Palmer, located them selves, one on each side of the cove: the cellars of their houses are still to be seen. West view of the Borough of Stonington. Massachusetts claimed this tract of country, by virtue of the assist ance they rendered to Connecticut, in the conquest of the Pequots. This claim was allowed by the commissioners of the colonies, and Mys tic river was adjudged to be the eastern boundary of Connecticut. Upon the petition of the planters, Oct. 19th, the General Court of Massachusetts made them a grant of eight miles eastward of tbe mouth of the Mystic, and eight miles northward into the country, and named the plantation Southerton. It continued under the government of Massachusetts, until after Connecticut obtained a royal charter. Stonington is bounded north by North Stonington, west by Mystic river, separating it from Groton, east by Pawcatuck river, which sepa rates it from Westerly, in the state of Rhode Island, and south by Fisher's Island sound and Narragansett bay. It averages about seven miles in length from east to west, and upwards of six in breadth, con taining forty five square miles. The township is uneven, and abounds with rocks ; the soil is, how ever, generally fertile, being well adapted for grazing. Within the limits of the town, in many places, are single, large rocks, lying loose upon the surface of other rocks imbedded\" in the earth. The three principal settlements, or villages, are Stonington borough, Lower Mys tic, opposite Portersville in Groton, and the village at the head of * Dr. Trumbull."], [363, "345 STONINGTON. Mystic. There is also a settlement of about fifteen or twenty houses on the Connecticut side of the Pawcatuck river, at Pawcatuck bridge. There are three houses of worship, two Congregational, and one Bap tist. There are one or two cotton factories, and one woolen factory, in the town. The marine situation and interests of Stonington have rendered it a conspicuous nursery for seamen, who are distinguished for their enterprise, perseverance, and courage. There are two banks ; the Stonington, and the Mystic. Stonington borough was incorporated in 1801. It is situated on a narrow, rocky point of land, of about half a mile in length, at the east ern extremity of Long Island sound. The borough consists of about 150 dwelling houses and stores, and upwards of 1,000 inhabitants, 2 churches, 1 Congregational, and 1 Baptist; 2 Academies, where the higher branches of education are taught, and 1 Bank. Sealing and whaling is the principal business. In some years 100,000 seal skins have been brought into this place. The breakwater at this place was erected by the United States, at an expense of about 50,000 dollars. In the severest seasons, ships can get up to the breakwater, without being obstructed by ice. Since the location of the New York, Provi dence and Boston rail road through this place, real estate has more than doubled in value. Stonington borough is 12 miles east from New London, and 45 from Providence. This town has become celebrated for the spirited and successful re sistance which it made to the attack and bombardment of Sir Thomas Hardy, during the late war. The following account is taken from \" Perkins' History of the Late War.\" \" On the 9th of August, (1814,) a detachment from the squadron off New London( consisting of the flagship Ramilies74, Pactolus 38, a bomb ship, and the Despatch brig oC22 guns, appeared off Stonington point. At five o'clock a note was addressed to the magistrates of the village by the commodore, informing them that one hour from the receipt of the note was allowed them for the removal of the unoffending inhabitants and effects. The officer who brought the note was inquired of whether a flag would be received from the magistrates ; his reply was, that no arrangement could be made. On being asked whether Commodore Hardy had determined to destroy the town, he replied that such were his orders from Admiral Cochrane ; and that it would be done most effectually. On receiving the communication, the village was thrown into the utmost consternation. The most valuable articles were hastily removed or concealed. The sick and aged were removed, the women, children, and inhabitants incapable of bearing arms, fled to the neighboring farm houses. A few militia, stationed at the point, under the command of Lieutenant Hough, were placed in the best positions to give notice of any attempt to land. A number of volunteers hastened to the battery on the point, which consisted of two eighteens, and one four pounder mounted on field carriages, protected by a slight breastwork. An express Was immediately dis patched to General Cushing at New London, the United Slates commanding general of the district, with a request for immediate assistance. The general considered this as a feint, intended to mask a real attack on fort Griswold, which commanded the har bor of New London ; that the object of the enemy was to draw the regular troops and militia from that post, and in the mean time land a considerable force at the head of Mystic, four miles in tbe rear of the fort, and take it by storm. Having accom plished this object, they could destroy or lay under contribution the town of New Lon don, and proceed up the river and capture the frigates.* This opinion of the gene ral's was confirmed in consequence of the squadron having lately been reinforced ; and a number of ships taking stations near Mystic. Having these views of the de signs of the enemy, General Cushing made correspondent arrangements with Major * General Cushing's letter to the secretary of war. \" 44"], [364, "346 STONINGTON. General Williams, commander of the division of militia in that district; and orders were immediately given for the assembling of one regiment at the point of attack at Stonington ; one at the head of Mystic river, to prevent a landing for the purpose of attacking fort Griswold ; one company of artillery and one regiment of infantry at Norwich port, a few miles in the rear of the frigates ; and one company of artillery and regiment of infantry for the protection of fort Trumbull and the city of New London. These dispositions were promptly and zealously carried into effect. \" The village of Stonington point consists of about one hundred dwelling houses, and a number of stores, compactly built on a narrow peninsula, extending half a mile, and forming a convenient harbor. The attack commenced on this village at 8 o'clock in the evening by a discharge of shells from the bomb ship, and rockets and carcasses from several barges and launches, which had taken their stations at different points. The first continued without intermission until midnight, and was occasionally an- swered from the battery, as the light of the rockets presented a view of the object. During this period, the non-combatant inhabitants of the village, having taken shel- ter in the neighboring houses and barns, were waiting the event in trembling anxiety ; expecting every moment to witness the conflagration of their dwellings. At twelve o'clock the firing ceased; no building was consumed, or person injured. In the course of the night the militia and volunteers assembled in considerable numbers. At day- light on the 10th, tbe approach of the British was announced by a discharge of rock- ets from several barges and a launch, which had taken their stations on the east side of the village, and out of the reach of the battery. A number of volunteers with musketry and one four pounder hastened across the point to meet the enemy, supposing they would attempt a landing from the barges. Colonel Randall osthe 13th regiment, who was at this time approaching the battery with a detachment of militia, ordered his men to assist the volunteers in drawing over one of the eighteen pounders to the extreme end of the point, the fire from which soon compelled the barges to seek their safety by flight : during this time the brig was working up towards the point, and at sunrise dropped anchor within half a mile of the battery. This was now manned by only about twenty men ; and their ammunition being expended, they spiked the guns and retired. The brig now continued deliberately to pour into the village her thirty two pound and grape shot, and the bomb ship to throw her shells for an hour without a shot being returned. \" At eight o'clock, a supply of ammunition having arrived, the eighteen pounder was drilled, and such an animated and well directed fire opened on the brig, that at three o'clock, having received several shot below her water mark, and much damage in her spars and rigging, she slipped her cables and hauled off out of the reach osthe battery. In this contest two Americans only were slightly wounded. The flag, which was nailed to the staff on the battery, was pierced with seven shot ; the breast-work was considerably damaged, aad six or eight dwelling houses much injured. Consid erable bodies of militia arrived in the course of the day; and Brigadier General Isham took the command. The inhabitants had recovered from the consternation of the first moments ; things assumed a more regular and orderly aspect. Every one capable of bearing arms was at the post of danger, and the others employed in re moving their effects. \" The Ramilies and Pactolus now hauled up and took stations within two miles of the village ; and threatened it with instant destruction. The magistrates sent a depu- tation on board the Ramilies with a note addressed to Commodore Hardy, informing him, lhat the town was now cleared of unoffending inhabitants, in consequence of his note of yesterday, and wishing to know his determination respecting the fate of the village. The deputation, consisting of Colonel Williams and Mr. Lord, were detained on board an hour, their own boat sent back ; and at the expiration of the time, they were conveyed in a flag from the ship, with a note to the magistrates, stating that the deputation having give assurance that no torpedoes had been fitted out from that port, and having engaged that none should be in future, or receive any aid from the town ; that further hostilities should cease, and the village be spared, in case they sent on board his ship, by eight o'clock in the morning of the 11th, Mrs. Stewart, a lady then resident at New London, wife of the late British consul at that place, and her family. But in case of failure, he should proceed to destroy the village effectually ; for which he stated that he possessed ample means. The magistrates and citizens of the borough were in a singular state of embarrassment on receiving this demand \u2022 being required to procure and send on board the commodore's ship, a lady over whom they had no control. Mrs. Stewart was under the protection of the government of the United States ; had ever been treated with respect at New London, where she had long resided ; her personal safety was never in the least at hazard ; and her husband's application to have his family sent on board the squadron had been received by the commanding general and transmitted to the executive, and no doubt would be granted \u2022 but the borough of Stonington had no concern or authority on the subject, and pos-"], [365, "347 WATERFORD. sessed no powers to comply with the required condition. At eight o'olock in the morning osthe 11th, the magistrates, under the direction osthe commanding general, sent a flag on board the Ramilies with the foregoing representation. The commodore replied, that he should wait until twelve o'clock, and if the lady was not then senl on board, hostilities would re-commence. At this period, three regiments of mililia had arrived, and the town was well secured against a landing. At three o'clock, the bomb ship, having taken a station out of ihe reach of the guns of the battery, commenced throwing shells into the village and continued until evening. At sunrise on the l'2th, the bomb ship renewed her operations, while the Ramilies and Pactolus were warp ing in ; at eight o'clock these ships opened their sire. This heavy bombardment con tinued until noon, when the ships ceased firing. At four in the afternoon they hauled off to their former anchorage, and the contest ended. The vice consul was obliged to resort to other and more appropriate measures to obtain his wife and family, than that of desolating an unoffending village. The ships taking a station out of the reach of cannon shot from the battery, the citizens were obliged to witness the scene without the power of resistance. The troops withdrew from the point, excepting a guard of fifty men, who were kept to patrole the streets and extinguish fires. The cannon from the battery were ordered up to the north end osthe point, to be in readi ness in case of an attempt at landing: this hazardous service was performed by vol unteers of the Norwich artillery, who instantly offered themselves, under the com mand of Lieutenant Lathrop. This party, though exposed the whole time to the ene my's fire, accomplished the enterprise without loss. During the whole scene no lives were lost, and but two or three wounded. The houses were several times set on fire by the rockets and shells, but were soon extinguished by the patrole. Many of the buildings were much damaged, and few remain without some marks of the bom bardment. The judicious arrangements of General Cushing, and the spirit and alac rity wilh which the militia turned out to defend Stonington, and guard the other ex posed points, prevented those ulterior operations of the British, which were appre hended by that general, and which no doubt were designed as the ultimate object of the expedition. The citizens of Connecticut, when called upon lo defend their dwell ings from conflagration, manifested a zeal and bravery worthy of freemen in defense of their soil. The reception which the British met with at Stonington, deterred them from any further attempts on the coast of Connecticut.\" WATERFORD. Waterford was formerly included within the limits of New London. It was incorporated as a distinct town in 1801. It is bounded n. by Montville, w. by Lyme, e. by New London and the Thames, and s. by Long Island sound. Its average length is 7 miles, and its average breadth about five miles. Its surface is uneven, and the soil a gravelly loam, better adapted to grazing than grain, of which there is little cul tivated, excepting Indian corn. There are two woolen factories in the town. In the southwestern part of the town is a valuable granite quarry, owned by the Messrs. Gardiner, at which many workmen are employed. There are three houses for public worship in this town, all of which are for the Baptist denomination ; one of which is for the Seventh day Baptists, so called from their observing Saturday, the Jewish sabbath, instead of the first day. The following is from Backus' history of the Baptists, vol. I, pub lished in Boston in 1777. \" A new sect came out from among the Baptists about this time, who have caused not a little trouble to themselves and others, of whom I have collected the following brief account, chiefly from the letters preserved by Mr. Samuel Hubbard. In the close of the year 1674, the family of Mr. James Rogers of New London, called Mr. Crandal over from Westerly, who preached among them, and baptized his sons John and James,"], [366, "348 WATERFORD. and an Indian named Japhet. This alarmed the other denomination, and Mr. Brad- street, minister at New London, said he hoped the next court would take a course with them. They sent to Newport, and elder Hickox, Mr. Hubbard, and his son Clarke. were sent to visit them in March, 1675, when Jonathan Rogers was also baptized, and all four of them were received as members of their church by prayer and laying on ot hands. Hereupon John Rogers' father-in-law, took his wife and children from him ; and upon her complaints against him, he was carried before their deputy governor, and committed to Hartford gaol, from whence he wrote to Mr. Hubbard, April 6th, 1 /65. How long he continued there I do not find, only he visited the church at Newport the next September. On September 18th, 1676, those four members went with a boat and brought elder Hickox and Mr. Hubbard to New London again, when old Mr Rogers, his wife, and daughter, were all baptized and received into that church ; whereupon they were called before the magistrate, but were soon released ; though from that time they began to imprison the Rogerses for working on the first day of the week. And when Mr. Hickox and Mr. Hubbard visited them again, and held worship with them two miles out of town, on their sabbath, Nov. 23, 1677, and Joseph Rogers' wife had next morning given tbem a satisfying account of her experiences, John must needs have them go up to town to baptize her there. Mr. Hubbard opposed it, but John carried the day ; and while Mr. Hickox was preaching at town, the constable came and took him, and they all went before the magistrate ; where also was the minister, Mr. Bradstreet, who had much to say about ihe good way their fathers had set up. Upon which Mr. Hubbard, obtaining leave to speak, said, ' you are a young man, but I am an old planter of about forty years, a beginner of Connecticut, and have been persecuted for my conscience from this colony, and I can assure you, thai the old begin ners were not for persecution, but we had liberty at first.' After further discourse, the magistrate said could you not do it elsewhere ? ' A good answer,' says Mr. Hubbard ; and so they were released and went to Samuel Rogers' house, where his brother John put himself forward, prayed, and then went out to the water and baptized his sister : upon which Mr. Hickox was seized again, as supposing he had done it, but John came before the magistrate, and was forward to make known his act therein ; so ihe others were released and returned home.\" \"Jonathan Rogers, had married Naomi Burdick, granddaughter lo Mr. Hubbard, and on March 2, 1678, elder Hickox, baptized her at Westerly, together with James Babcock, George Lamphere, and two others, and on the 5th of May following, Joseph Clarke wrote from thence to his father Hubbard, that John and James Rogers with their father were in prison ; having previously excommunicated Jonathan, chiefly because he did not retain their judgment osthe unlawfulness of using medicine, nor accuse himself before authority, for working on the first day of the week.\" Hereupon the church at Newport sent messengers to New London about this matter, who re ported on their return that, \" a practice was started up (out of conscience,) that because the world, yea, most professors, pray in their families mornings and nights, and before meats and after, in a customary way, therefore to forbear prayer in their families, or at meats publickly except some are led forth upon some special occasion ; saying they find no command in the word of God for it.\" \" The church repeatedly sent and labored with them but to no effect.\" \"From this beginning proceeded a sect which has continued to this day, whom from their chief leader have been called Rogerenes. In their dialect, and many other things, they have been like the first Quakers in this country (!) though they have retained the external use of baptism and the supper, and have been singular in refusing the use of means and medicines for their bodies. Their greatest zeal has been discovered going from meeting to meeting, and from town to town, as far as Norwich and Lebanon, (the one 14, the other 24 miles,) to testify against hireling teachers, and against keeping the first day of the week as a sabbath, which they call tbe idol sabbath. And when the authority have taken them up, and fined them therefor, and have sometimes whipt them for refusing to pay it, they have soon published accounts of all such persecutions, which has been the very means of keeping their sect alive. When the Small Pox was very terrible in Boston, in 1721, and great fear of it was discovered in the country, John Rogers their founder, was confident he could go in where it was and not catch it : and to prove his faith, went 100 miles to Boston, but catched the distemper, came home and died with it and scattered it in his family : yet his successors still kept on in their way. bo late down as 1763, some of them repeatedly came and clapped shingles and pieces ot boards around the meeting house in Norwich town, as well as delivered messages to the woishippers against their keeping osthe Lord's day Besides these there have been some Sabbatarian Baptists in that place, from the beginning to the present time, though not a distinct church.\" 6 6 \"'^,ccul"], [367, "349 FAIRFIELD. FAIRFIELD COUNTY. Fairfield County is bounded n. by Litchfield County, n. e. and E. by the Housatonic river, which separates it from the county of New Haven, on the s. e. and s. by Long Island Sound, and w. by the state of New York. The county is of a triangular form, and has an average length from east to west of about 30 miles, and a mean breadth from north to south of about 21 miles. It extends about 40 miles on Long Island sound, and abounds with bays, points, and harbors, affording many interesting and beautiful landscapes. Proceeding from the Sound into the interior, there is a very gradual rise to the most elevated sec tions of the county, which overlook the intervening tract. The face of the country is generally agreeably diversified with hills and valleys. The soil, which in general is a primitive gravelly loam, is, with few exceptions, strong and fertile, and this county may be considered as a rich farming district, containing abundant natural resources of agricul tural wealth. Manufactures of various kinds receive considerable atten tion in some parts of the county, and the business is increasing. The following is a list of the several towns in the county, with their population in 1830.

Mr. Ludlow, who went with the troops to the Sasco, the great swamp in this town, was so well pleased with the fine tract of land in the vi cinity, that he soon projected a settlement. In 1639, he, with a num ber of others, began a plantation at Unquowa, the Indian name of the place. At first there were but eight or ten families. These, it appears, removed from Windsor with Mr. Ludlow,* the principal planter. They were shortly after joined by another company from Watertown. A third company removed into the plantation from Concord; so that the * Mr. Ludlow came from the west of England, with Warham and his company. In 1634. he was chosen deputy governor of Massachusetts colony; the next year he came into Connecticut, and was twice elected deputy governor osthe colony, and was compiler of the first Connecticut code, printed at Cambridge in 1G92. He removed with his family to Virginia, in 1654. Being town clerk of Fairfield, he carried off their records and other public writings."], [368, "350 fairfield. inhabitants soon became numerous, and formed themselves into a town ship under the jurisdiction of the colony of Connecticut. The first adventurers purchased a large tract of the natives, and soon after Con necticut obtained charter privileges, the General Assembly gave thema patent. The purchase comprised the parishes of Fairfield, Greenfield, Green's Farms, and that part of Stratfield lying within the town ol Fairfield, all the town of Weston, and a considerable part of Reading. \" Having obtained this patent, the proprietors soon after divided the territory purchased into lots, which run from near the shore of the Sound, back about ten miles, reserving suitable highways, running par allel to, and at right angles with these lots, the course of which was north, 28 degrees west. These highways were laid entirely straight for ten miles, but have since been altered in many places.\" \" As but a small part of this extensive tract of land had been occu pied, previously to the time when Sir Edmund Andross made his ap pearance in Connecticut, the inhabitants of this town adopted this plan of dividing their purchase, to prevent their wild lands back from being taken from them ; supposing, that as they were actually in the occupa tion of the front of their lots, they might be considered as possessing the whole, so far as to render it private property, and not subject to the disposal of the British government. The lots were of different widths ; some being about ten rods wide, while others were fifty rods in width. Each proprietor had set to him a lot, the width of which was probably regulated by the amount of tbe money paid by such proprietor ; and in the measuring of these lots, regard was had to inches, which shows a precise arithmetical calculation. Each of these lots has to this day been called by the name of the first proprietor, although a very con siderable proportion of them are owned by persons of different names. Nearly in the center of this town was reserved a tract, one mile in ex tent, which was not divided, and was called the mile of common. Greenfield Hill is within the limits of this tract.\" Fairfield is bounded northerly by Weston, northeasterly by Bridge port, westerly by Westport, and southerly by Long Island sound. It has a mean length of upwards of six miles from northeast to southwest, and a breadth of six miles. It is a rich agricultural township, and in general in a high state of cultivation. The original growth of timber was, at an early period, from a common but lamentable improvidence, entirely destroyed, so that the forests now existing are of recent growth, and comprise but little timber fit for building. Wood and timber, there fore, command a high price. The surface of the town is undulating, presenting an agreeable succession of moderate eminences and gentle declivities. Upon the Sound are some tracts of salt marsh ; proceeding back, the surface has a gradual elevation ; but no portion of the town is mountainous, and it is in general free from stone. Black Rock harbor, about 1 J miles from Fairfield court house, is, with the exception of New London, one of the best harbors in the Sound, being safe and commodious, and having 19 feet of water at sum mer tides, below what is called the middle ground. There is a light house on Fairweather's Island, which forms the easterly chop of\u00b0the"], [369, "351 FAIRFIELD. harbor. Vessels can enter and depart from this harbor at any time of the tide. During the last war with Great Britain, a small sort was erected on an eminence commanding the entrance of the harbor, in which the state of Connecticut maintained a small body of militia a short time as a garrison. This fort was useful,' in protecting the coast ing trade in the Sound from the cruisers of the enemy. About two or three miles from Fairfield, in a northern direction, is a precipice about 70 feet in height, being the termination of a granitic ridge. This precipice is called Samp Mortar Rock, from the circum stance of there being on its summit an excavation in the form of a mortar, and of sufficient dimensions to contain upwards of half a bushel of corn or other grain. The tradition is, that it was used by the native Indians for the purpose of pounding their corn. In the valley south of the rock is believed to have been the site of a large Indian village and burying ground. The rock above mentioned, has sometimes been called Owen's Rock, from the circumstance of a man by tbe name of Owen, who had lost his way, walking off this precipice in a dark night. His body was sound the next morning. Dr. Dwight, who was at that time the minister at Greenfield, preached his funeral sermon. Fairfield is divided into three parishes, Fairfield, Green's Farms, and Greenfield. Fairfield, the ancient village, is situated upon the great stage road to New York, 4 miles from Bridgeport, 21 from New Haven, and 58 from New York. It is built principally upon one street, and round an interesting green or square. The village consists of about 100 dwelling houses, a court house and jail, a Congregational church, and an academy. It is the shire town osthe county. Half of the courts, how ever, sit at Danbury, about twenty miles distant. This place was laid in ashes, by Gov. Tryon, in 1779, during the Revolutionary war. Eighty five dwellings were consumed in Fairfield, two churches, an elegant court house, fifty five barns, fifteen stores, fif teen shops, &,c. The distress occasioned by this event was extreme. The following graphic description of the burning of Fairfield is from Dr. Dwight's Travels, volume 3d, page 512. \" On the 7th July, 1779, Gov. Tryon, with the army which I have already mentioned, sailed from New Haven to Fairfield : and the next morning disembarked upon the beach. A few militia assembled lo oppose them; and in a desultory, scattered man- ner, fought with great intrepidity through most of the day. They killed some; took several prisoners ; and wounded more. But the expedition was so sudden and unex- pected, that the efforts, made in this manner, were necessarily fruitless. The town was plundered ; a great part of the houses, together wilh the two churches, the court house, jail, and school houses, were burnt. The barns had been just filled with wheat, and other produce. The inhabitants, therefore, were turned out into the world, almost literally destitute. \" Mrs. Burr, the wife of Thaddeus Burr, Esq. high sheriff of the county, resolved to continue in the mansion house of the familv, and make an attempt to save it from the conflagration. The house stood at a sufficient distance from other buildings. Mrs. Burrwas adorned with all the qualities, which gave distinction to her sex ; pos- sessed of fine accomplishments, and a dignity of character, scarcely rivalled; and probably had never known what it was to be treated with disrespect, or even with in- attention. She made a personal application to Gov. Tryon, in terms, which, from a lady of her high respectability, could hardly have failed of a satisfactory answer from any person, who claimed the title of a gentleman. The answer which she actually received, was, however, rude and brutal ; and spoke the want, not only of politeness and humanity, but even of vulgar civility. The house was sentenced to the flames,"], [370, "352 FAIRFIELD. and was speedily set on fire. An attempt was made, in he mean time, by soldiery, to rob her of a valuable watch with rich h^be'en already con ,o protect her, as well as i to preserve , the honse. The jatc h M. i contributes veyed out of their reach; but the house, filled with ever) inrag either to comfort or elegance of living, was laid in ashes , heaVens ;nst as \"While the town was in flames, a thunder storm overspread \u00bbew , J night came on.

Tryon for this Indian effort, was conveyed in the fol lowing sentence ' The village was burnt, to resent the fire of the rebels from their hoTise? and to mask our retreat.' This declaration unequivocally proves, that the rebels Were troublesome to their invaders; and at the same time is to be considered as the best apolo-y, which they were able to make. But it contains a palpable falsehood, mended w ' Sltify conduct which admits of no excuse, and rejects with disdain every attempt at palliation. Why did this body of men land at Fairfield at all? There were here no stores ; no fortress ; no enemy ; except such as were to be found m every village throughout the United States. It was undoubtedly the original object of the expedition to set fire to this town, and the apology was created after the work was done It was perfectly unnecessary to mask the retreat. The townsmen, and the little'collection of farmers, assembled to aid them, had no power to disturb it Ko British officer, no British soldier, would confess, that in these circumstances he felt the least anxiety concerning any molestation from such opposers. \" The injuries done to a single family, were an immense overbalance lor all tne <rood acquired in this expedition, either by the individuals engaged in it or the nation in whose service they acted. Particularly, that highly respectable pair, Mr and Mrs Burr in the loss of the mansion of their ancestors, and the treasures with which it had been 'stored through a long succession of years ; where the elegant hospitality, which had reigned in it ; the refined enjoyments, which were daily felt, and daily distributed to the friend, and the stranger; the works of charity, which were there multiplied; and the rational piety, which was at once the animating and controlling principle; diffused a brilliancy, marked even by the passing eye; lost more than the whole Brit- ish nation gained by this devastation. \" The next morning the troops re-embarked ; and, proceeding to Green s Farms, set fire to the church, and consumed it; together with fifteen dwelling houses, eleven barns, and several stores. Among the houses was that of the Rev. Dr. Ripley, the respectable clergyman of this parish. Here, also, was another proof, that burning was the object of the expedition. The number of dwelling houses consumed in Fair- field was eighty five ; of barns, fifty five; of stores, fifteen ; of shops, fifteen ; &c.\" The building seen in the center of the print is the court house ; the church is on the right, and the jail on the left. All these buildings are erected on the very same foundations on which similar buildings stood in 1779, when Tryon laid them in ashes. The church is built precisely in the same form as the one burnt, it being the wish of the el derly people, that the house should have the same appearance as for merly ; the same fact is believed to be true of the form of the court house and jail. The stone steps of the church remain in their former"], [371, "353 FAIRFIELD.

Taking these facts into consideration, it may be fairly presumed, that this place, the green, houses, &lc. have the same appearance as they did in 1779. At the time of the burning of the town, there were five hundred barrels of rice, which had been smug gled, stored in the cellar of the court house ; it was all destroyed by the fire. As a British officer was coming out of this cellar, a 24 Ib. shot came so near him, that he barely saved himself by springing up wards, and tbe ball passed between his legs. The house of Mr. Burr, mentioned by Dr. Dwight, was about ten rods distant from the jail, on the eastern side of tbe road. Mr. Jones' house, one of the handsomest in the place, is built upon its foundations. One of the Hessians who was killed, was buried at the western side osthe church. Western view of the Buckley house, Fairfield. This building is one osthe oldest in the town, having stood one hun dred and fifty years, and has been used as a tavern ever since the year 1740, till within one or two years past. It stands on the eastern side 45"], [372, "354 FAIRFIELD. of the green, fronting the church, which is about thirty rods distant. When this house was erected, it was necessary to clear away the forest trees. It was built by Mr. Buckley, and has ever remained in possess ion of his descendants of that name to the present time. There has been however two modern additions ; one is seen at the south end, the other on the west side of the house. At the time of the invasion of the British, a 24 pound shot, which was fired from Black Rock, entered the chimney. In the entrance at the door, are still to be seen the marks of twenty seven bullets, on the stair-way. The heat was so great during the conflagration, that all the window glass in front of this house were broken. This bouse was Tryon's head-quarters while in tbe place ; he lodged in tbe chamber in the south part of the house, shewn in the en graving by the letter a. It was also the bead-quarters of Col. Tal madge, who arrived from White Plains the day after Tryon left. His army encamped before the house, and their tents covered the green. Soon after the army had departed, Capt. Sturges, who commanded a company of militia, came into the street, placed a field piece in front of where the church now stands, and pointing it at the Buckley house, in formed Mrs. Buckley that he would allow her a short time to clear the house, and unless she left it, would blow her to atoms. Mrs. Buckley found means to let Gen. Silliman (who lived about two miles distant) know her situation. He immediately came, and sound about 150 men by the cannon. He ordered them to disperse, and unless they obeyed him, he would put them under guard. This threat had the desired effect. The naval officer who bad charge of the fleet, which conveyed the British forces under Tryon to this place, and acted as pilot, was brother to Mrs. Buckley. Before Tryon landed his forces, he requested that the house of his sister might be saved, and its inmates protected. Tryon, after his arrival, informed Mrs. Buckley that if she wished any other houses spared, it should be done ; accordingly the four neighboring houses were saved by her means. Tryon having occasion to leave the house for a short time, a Hessian soldier, taking advantage of his ab sence, came into the house, and seeing a gold ring on the finger of Mrs. Buckley, demanded it of her, with the threat that if she refused he would cut off her finger: she refusing, he seized her hand, and tore off the ring with such violence that part of the flesh was stripped from her finger. When Tryon returned, being informed of this transaction, he ordered the Hessian to be severely punished. The British landed in the morning, and stayed during the day and night. The town was fired very early next morning. As they left the place, the Hessians remained behind and set fire to the buildings. It seems to have been the policy of the British commanders, to employ this part of their forces to perform all acts of a barbarous and savage kind, which they wished to inflict. The inhabitants generally fled, but not expecting to have their houses burnt, left most of their furniture. There was but little opposition, there being but few militia and no regular troops in the vicinity, at the time of the landing. Among the barbarous trans actions of the enemy was the following, which was related by Capt. Levi Burr, an eye witness, who was then a lad, ten years of age."], [373, "355 FAIRFIELD. A shot was fired from one of the houses, which killed a British sol dier ; his comrades rushed into the house, seized the man who they supposed had fired the shot, wrapped him up in a sheet, which had been dipped in rum, and set it on fire. An aged colored man, it is said, also suffered death in the same manner. The following elegy on the burning of Fairfield was written by Col. Humphreys, in 1779, on the spot where the town stood. Ye smoking ruins, marks of hostile ire, Ye ashes warm, which drink the tears tiiat flow, Ye desolated plains my voice inspire, And give soft music to the song of woe. How pleasant; Fairfield, on th' enraptur'd sight, Rose thy tall spires, and op'd thy social halls ! How oft my bosom beat with pure delight At yonder spot where stand thy darkened walls ! But there the voice of mirth resounds no more. A silent sadness thro' the streets prevails ; The distant main alone is heard to roar, And hollow chimneys hum with sudden gales- Save where scorch'd elms th' untimely\" foliage shed, Which rustling, hovers round the faded green- Save where, at twilight, mourners frequent tread, Mid recent graves, o'er desolation's scene. How chang'd the blissful prospect when compar'd These glooms funereal, with thy former bloom, Thy hospitable rights when Tryon shar'd Long ere he sealed thy melancholy doom. That impious wretch with coward voice decreed Defenceless domes and hallowed fanes to dust ; Beheld, with sneering smile, the wounded bleed, And spurr'd his bands to rapine, blood, and lust. Vain was the widow's, vain the orphan's cry, To touch his feelings, or to soothe his rage \u2014 Vain the fair drop that roh'd from beauty's eye, Vain the dumb grief of supplicating age. Could Tryon hope to quench the patriot flame, Or make his deeds survive in glory's page's Could Britons seek of savages the same ; Or deem it conqnest, thus the war to wage? Yes, Britons scorn the councils of the skies, Extend wide havoc, spurn th' insulted foes; Th' insulted foes to tenfold vengeance rise, Resistance growing as the danger grows. Red in their wounds, and pointing to the plain, The visionary shapes befure me stand \u2014 The thunder bursts, the battle burns again, And kindling fires encrimson all the strand. Long dusky wreaths of smoke, reluctant driv'n, In blackening volumes o'er the landscape bend : Here the broad splendor blazes high to heav'n, There uinber'd streams in purple pomp ascend. In fiery eddies, round the tott'ring walls, Emitting sparks, the lighter fragments sty ; With frightful crash the burning mansion falls, The works of years in glowing embers lie. Tryon, behold thy sanguine flames aspire, Clouds ting'd with dies intolerably bright. Behold, well pleas'd the village wrapt in sire, Let one wide ruin glut thy ravish'd sight ! Ere fades the grateful scene, indulge thine eye, See age and sickness, tremulously slow Creep from the flames. See babes in torture die, And mothers swoon in agonies of woe. Go, gaze enraptur'd with the mother's tear, The infant's terror, and the captive's pain. Where no bold bands can check thy curst career ; Mix lire with blood on each unguarded plain ! These be thy triumphs ! this thy boasted fame! Daughters of mern'ry raise the deathless song ! Repeat thro' endless years his hated name, Embalm his crimes, and teach the world our wrongs. Southport is situated at the mouth of Mill river, and is a flourishing village, about two miles s. w. of Fairfield court house. Ten years since it contained only about twenty buildings ; at this time there are from 60 to 70 dwelling houses, 8 stores, an academy, post office, a bank, and an Episcopal church. Forty years since there were but eight build ings in this place, and but one sloop owned, which run to Boston ; now more shipping is owned in this place in proportion to its size, than in any other place between New York and Boston. It has the advantage of a considerably extensive and fertile back country. The produce from Greenfield, and the country adjacent, is brought here, to be shipped for New York and the southern ports. The harbor is small, but of suffi cient depth to float vessels of about 100 tons burthen. It has an ad vantage over most other harbors on the coast, in its being rarely frozen sufficiently to obstruct navigation. Ten thousand dollars have been granted by the U. S. government for the improvement of the harbor, and an extensive breakwater was erected at its entrance, in 1831. Im mediately opposite the village there are very extensive flats, which sometimes are overflowed by freshets. One of the most prominent objects in the following view, is the Episco palc hurch, which stands on elevated ground ; the small spire on the left stands on the Academy, near which is seen the Southport Bank, with pillars in front. The building in the distance on the extreme right is a"], [374, "356 FAIRFIELD.

The spire of tbe Episcopal church in Fairfield, is seen above the mill. Immediately back of the village is tbe celebra ted Pequot swamp,* where this once powerful and warlike tribe of sav ages, in July, 1637, made their last stand against the forces of Connec ticut and Massachusetts, under the command of Capt. Mason. In this, their last conflict with the English, the Pequots received their final overthrow, and their existence as a distinct tribe was annihilated. Dr. Dwight, in his poem entitled \" Greenfield Hill,\" says, after tbe Pequot fort at Mystic was destroyed by Capt. Mason, a large body of tbe Pe quots found refuge in this swamp. \" One of their number loitering be hind tbe rest, was discovered by the English troops, then commanded by Capt. Stoughton, of Massachusetts; and was compelled to disclose their retreat. One hundred of them, it is said, surrendered. Tbe rest, bravely resolving to live and die together, were attacked and chiefly destroyed.\" The following is extracted from the fourth part of the poem. This part is entitled, \"The Destruction of the Pequots.\" \" Amid a circling marsh, expanded wide, To a lone hill the Pequots wound their way; And none, but Heaven, the mansion had descried, Close-tangled, wild, impervious lo the dav; But one poor wanderer, loitering long astray, Wilder'd in labyrinths of pathless wood, In a tall tree embower'd obscurely lay: Straight summon'd down, the trembling suppliant show'd Where lurk'd his vanished friends, within their drear abode.\" . A new road was made two or three years since through the Pequot swamp pass ing over some remains of an Indian fort, which it appears formerly stood on an ele vated piece of ground in the midst osthe swamp. In order to lower the ground where the fort stood (the surface of the ground being frozen,) an excavation was made in doing which the earth above fell, and one maa was instantly killed"], [375, "FAIRFIELD. 357 Academy and Congregational Church on Greenfield Hill, Fairfield. The building on the right is the Congregational church, in which President Dwight, of Yale College, preached a number of years. He resided a few rods south osthe church, in a house which he built, now the mansion of Isaac Bronson, Esq., a gentleman of great wealth and respectability. The Academy* is seen on the left ; it is a small build ing, about the ordinary size of a school-house. It was established and its reputation maintained by Dr. Dwight for twelve years. It is still a respectable seminary, where young ladies are taught the higher branches of female education. On tbe extreme left is seen the spire osthe Con gregational church in Fairfield, about three miles distant, beyond which the Sound and Long Island appear. This place is most justly celebrated for the prospect which is obtained from the belfry of the church. No other spot in Connecticut can show such a commanding, extensive, and beautiful prospect. Seventeen churches can be seen, viz. two in Fair field, three in Bridgeport, two in Stratford, two in Milford, two on Long Island, and one in each osthe following places, viz.

In a clear day, the East Rock near New Haven is distinctly seen. The society or parish of Greenfield is about four miles square, and contains about 1200 inhabitants. It is believed that some of the best farmers in the state are in this place and its vicinity ; they live scattered about on their farms. The average amount of land improved by each farmer is about 150 acres of fine soil, the average price of which is about one hundred dollars per acre. Dr. Dwight, while the minister of Greenfield, wrote the poem enti tled Greenfield Hill. \" On this height,\" he says, \" the writer is sup posed to stand. The first object there offering itself to his view, is the Landscape ; which is accordingly made the governing subject of the first part osthe poem. The following is an extract. \" Heavens, what a matchless group of beauties rare Southward expands! where crown'd with yon tall oak, Round-hill the circling land and sea o'erlooks; Or, smoothly sloping, Grover's beauteous rise, Spreads its green sides, and lifts its single tree, Glad mark for seamen ; or, with ruder face, Orchards, and fields, and groves, and houses rare, And scatter'd cedars, Mill-hill meets the eye: Or where, beyond, with every beauty clad, More distant heights in vernal pride ascend. On either side, a long, continued range, In all the charms of rural nature dress'd Slopes gently to the main. Ere Tryon sunk To infamy unfathom'd, thro' yon groves Once glisten'd Norwalk's white-ascending spires, And soon, if Heaven permit, shall shine again. Here, sky-encircled, Stratford's churches beam; And Stratfield's turrets greet the roving eye. In clear, full view, with every varied charm That forms the finish'd landscape, blending soft In matchless union, Fairfield and Green's Farms Give lustre to' the day. Here, crown'd with pines And skirting groves, with creeks and havens fair Embellish'd, fed with many a beauteous stream, Prince osthe waves, and ocean's favorite child, Far westward fading in confusion blue, And eastward stretch'd beyond the human ken, And mingled with the sky; there Longa's Sound Glorious expands.\" The following is from the 3d volume osthe Massachusetts Historical Collections ; it is entitled \" A letter from the Rev.

About four o'clock the next morning, the approach os the fleet was announced by the firing of a gun from a small fort we have on Graver's hill, contiguous to the Sound. They seemed however to be passing by. And about seven o'clock we, with pleasure, beheld them all to the westward of us, steering, as we thought to New York. A very thick fog came on, which entirely deprived -us of the sight of them till between the hours of nine and ten, when the misl clearing away, we beheld the whole fleet under our western shore, and some of them close in with Kensie's Point. They presently came to anchor, and lay till about four in the afternoon, when they began lo land their troops a little to the east of Kensie's Point, at a place called the Pines. From thence the troops marched along the beach until they came to a lane opposite the center of the town, through which they proceeded, and in about an hour paiaded in their divis ions on the green, between the meeting house and court house. From thence they detached their guards, and dividing into small parlies, proceeded to their infernal business. Their commanding officers were Sir George Collier by sea, Generals Tryon and Garth by land. The approach of the fleet was so sudden, that but few men could be collected, though the alarm guns were fired immediately on the dissipa tion of ihe fog. There was no thought of opposing their landing, as our force was nothing to theirs. Our little party, however, posted themselves so as to annoy them to the best advantage, expecting they would land at ihe Point. When our people found them landing on the led and marching in Ihe rear lo take possession of the town, they immediately retreated lo the court house; and as the enemy advanced from the beach lane, they gave them such a warm reception with a field piece, which threw both round and grape shot, and with their musketry, as quite disconcerted them for some time. The column, however, quickly recovered its solidity, and advancing rapidly, forced our small body to retreat lo the heights, back of the town, where they were joined by numbers coming in from the country. The enemy were likewise gall ed very much, as they turned from the beach to the lane, by the cannon which played from Graver's hill. The town was almost cleared of inhabitants. A few women, some of whom were of the most respectable families and characters, tarried with a view of saving their property. They imagined their sex and character would avail to such a purpose. They put some confidence in the generosity of an enemy, who were once famed for generosity and politeness; and thought that kind treatment and submissive behavior would secure them against harsh trealment and rough usage. Alas! they were mis erably mistaken, and bitterly repented their confidence and presumption. The Hessians were first let loose for rapine and plunder. They entered houses, attacked the persons of whig and tory indiscriminately; breaking open desks, trunks, closets, and taking away every thing of value. They robbed women of their buckles, rings, bonnets, aprons, and handkerchiefs. They abused them with the foulest and most profane language, threatened their lives without the least regard to the most earnest cries and entreaties. Looking glasses, china, and all kinds of furniture were soon dashed to pieces. Another party that came on were the American refugees, who, in revenge for their confiscated estates, carried on the same direful business. They were not, however, so abusive to the women as the former, but appeared very furious against the town and country. The Britons, by what I could learn, were the least inveterate : some of the officers seemed to pity the misfortunes of the country, but in excuse said, thai they had no other way to gain their authority over us. Individuals among the British troops, were, however exceedingly abusive, especially to women. Some were forced to submit to the most indelicate and rough treatment, in defense of their virtue, and now bear the bruises of horrid conflict. About an hour before sunset, the conflagration began at the house of Mr. Isaac Jen nings, which was consumed, with the neighboring buildings. In the evening, the house of Elijah Abel, Esq. sheriff of the county, was consumed with a few others. In the night several buildings in the main street. Gen. Tryon was in various parts of the town plot; with the good women begging and entreating him to spare their houses. Mr. Sayre, the Church of England missionary, a gentleman firmly and zeal ously engaged in the British interest, and who has suffered considerably in their cause, joined with them in these entreaties ; he begged the general to spare the town, but was denied. He then begged that some few houses might be spared as a shelter for those who could provide habitations no where else; this was denied also. At length Mr. Tryon consented to save the buildings of Mr. Burr and the writer of this epistle. Both had been plundered ere this. He said, likewise, lhat the houses for public wor ship should be spared. He was far from being in a good temper, during the whole affair. General Garth, at the other end of the town, treated the inhabitants with as much humanity, as his errand would admit. At sunrise some considerable part of the town was standing : but in about two hours the flames became general. The burning parties carried on their business with"], [378, "360 FAIRFIELD* horrible alacrity, headed by one or two persons who were born and bred in the neigh- boring towns. All the town, from the bridge by Colonel Gold's to the Mill river, a few houses excepted, was a heap of ruin. About eight o'clock, the enemy sounded a retreat. We had some satisfaction, amidst our sorrow and distress, to see that the meeting house and a few other buildings remained. But the rear guard, consisting of a banditti, the vilest that was ever let loose among men, set fire to every thing which General Tryon had left, the large and ele- gant meeting house, the minister's houses, Mr. Burr's, and several other houses which had received protection. They tore the protection to pieces, damned Tryon, abused the women most shamefully, and then ran off in a most disgraceful manner. Hap- pily, our people came in and extinguished the flames in several houses ; so that we are not entirely destitute. The rear guard, which behaved in so scandalous a manner, were chiefly German troops, called Yaugers. They carry a small rifle gun, and fight in a skulking manner, like our Indians. They may be properly called sons of plunder and devastation. Our people on the heights, back osthe town, were joined by numbers, but not equal to the numbers of the enemy. They were skirmishing all the evening, part of the night, and the next morning. The enemy were several times disconcerted and driven from their outposts. Had they continued longer in town, it must have been fatal to them ; for the militia were collecting from all parts. Our fort yet stands. The enemy sent a row galley to silence it, and there was con- stant firing between them all night. One or two attempts were made to take it by parties of troops, but it was most bravely and obstinately defended by Lieut. Isaac Jarvis of this town, who had but twenty three men besides himself. The militia followed these bloody incendiaries to the place of embarkation, and galled them considerably. The embarkation took place about twelve o'clock, and they set sail for Long Island about two or three in the afternoon. Many were killed on both sides. The number cannot be ascertained. They car ried off some prisoners, but no person of distinction. One particular I would mention. After Tryon had begun lo burn, he sent out the proclamation which you have in the Hartford paper. In the midst of hostilities, while the flames were raging and bullets flying, who should come out with the flag, but Mr. Sayre ! A spirited answer was sent in ; and the people were so enragad that hostilities should be going on in the lime of negociation ; and that Mr. Sayre should be the bearer of such an insulting proclamation, and at such a time, that the said gen- tleman was obliged to quit the town when the enemy lest it. His whole family were obliged to go with him, leaving the greatest part of their substance behind, which be came fuel for the flames, indiscriminately scattered by the rear guard. The reply which general Tryon made to Mr. Sayre, when he asked to go with him was, \" You may go on board the ships, sir, but I cannot promise you any help or assistance.\" The Church of England building was consumed, but by whom, or at what time, I am unable to say. Unconnected with them, unsolicited on my part, through the intercession of Mr. Sayre, my house and property received a proteclion in General Tryon's own hand writing. A sentinel was placed there some part of the time. But sad experience convinces me to how little purpose all this was. My property was plundered, my house and furniture all consumed, though a lady was so kind as to show them the protec tion, which like others, was torn in pieces by the Yaugers. Our friend, Joseph Bertram, was shot through the breast ; old Mr. Solomon Sturgis, an Irish servant of Mr. Penfield, and a negro man belonging to Mr. Lewis, were put to death by the bayonet. The distress of this poor people is inexpressible. A most pleasant and delightful town in flames! What a scene did the 8th of July present. But I must forbear ! Every thing I have written you may depend upon as a fact : my pen has not been guided by prejudice, whatever my feelings are ; and should you publish the letter, every reader may be assured that there is not the least deviation from what actually took place upon this melancholy occasion. Yours, &c. Andrew Eliot. EXTRACTS FROM NEWSPAPERS. From the Connecticut Journal, Feb. 26, 1768.

We hear from Fairfield, that on the 12th ult. a number of men, at low water, walked out to get clams, upon the Beach in that harbor, where they continued so long that they were surrounded by the tide, and in wading ashore several of them were in im minent danger of losing their lives; however, they all escaped except one David Keeler ofRidgeneld, who being a good swimmer, attempted the passage with a bag of clams fastened to the waistband of his breeches, when in crossing a hole of deep water he sunk, and was drowned before any assistance could be given him. His body was found wilhin three hours, and several experiments tried to restore him to life, but in vain. It is remarkable that the same day 12 months, and about the same hour of the day, lieut. Abraham Camp of that town was drowned in attempting to swim a horse across the same deep hole, and soon aster one Benjamin Whitney was drowned in or near the same place. The following letter is copied from the town Records of Fairfield. Boston, November 24, 1774. Gentlemen, \u2014 The testimony which the patriotic inhabitants osthe town of Fairfield have given of their attachment to the common and glorious cause of Liberty, by the liberal donation of seven hundred and filly bushels of grain, by Capt. Thorp, has afforded much comfort as well as seasonable relies to their friends in Boston, who are now suffering under the cruel rod of tyranny and oppression. The sympathy of our friends is a great support under our trials, notwithstanding the greatness and severity of them, and we trust, through the favor of our God, we shall be enabled to persevere in our opposition to the enemies of America, and so answer the hopes and expecta tions of our friends, of whose generous donations we trust we shall ever retain a grate ful sense. We are particularly obliged by the assurances you give us, \" that you are not in sensible of our sufferings, and the hope you express, that you shall consider yourselves bound to afford us such succor and relief, a3 your circumstances and our wants may demand.\" May a kind providence bountifully reward your liberality and kindness, and the blessings of Him that was ready to perish, come down and rest on the heads of the generous inhabitants of the town of Fairfield. We hope the inclosed account osthe manner in which the committee are distributing the donations of our friends and benefactors, in whose cause (as well as our own) this town is suffering, will meet with your approbation, as it will afford great satisfaction to your obliged friend, and humble servants.

DANBURY. The original Indian name of Danbury was Pahquioque. The first settlement in the town was begun in the summer of 1684. The set tlers came that year and begun some improvements in buildings, sowing grain, <kc. Some of the families continued through the winter, others did not move till tbe spring following. It may therefore be said that the first permanent settlement was made in the spring of tbe year 1685, by eight families.* The names of the men were Thomas Taylor, Fran cis Bushnel, Thomas Barnum, John Hoyt, James Benedict, Samuel Benedict, James Beebe, and Judah Gregory. They settled near to gether, at the south end of the town street. They all came from Nor walk, except James Beebe, who was from Stratford : one of the first settlers after the first eight families, was Dr. Samuel Wood, an able physician, born and educated in England ; Josiah Starr from Long Island, Joseph Mygatt from Hartford, and the families of Picket, Knapp, and Wildman, were all ancient settlers of the town. The town was survey ed in February, 1693, by John Platt and Samuel Hayes, of Norwalk : the survey bill declares the length to be 8 miles from north to south, and the breadth 6. ' The lands were purchased osthe Indian proprietors. \" The time when a church was first organized in town, cannot be exactly determin ed ; it was probably at the ordination of the first minister. The first minister in this town was the Rev. Seth Shove, a very pious and worthy man, who was very success ful in his exertions for the promotion of peace, virtue and true religion: so that the general peace and union in his time, are proverbial to this-day. He was ordained in the year 1696, and died October 3d, 1735, aged 68. The town was destitute of a settled minister but a short time. In a few months the church and people in great harmony invited Mr. Ebenezer White to settle with them in the ministry. He was accordingly ordained, March 10th, 1736. Universal harmony prevailed between the people and their minister, lor more than 25 years. The people of this town were considered by all the neighboring towns, as eminent for morality and religion, for regularity of con duct and tor constant attendance on the institutions of Christianity. Itis supposed on good grounds, that the first meeting house was built prior to Mr. Shove's ordination \u25a0 its dirnensions were about 40 feet in length and 30 in breadth. It is remarkable, that alter the frame was raised, every person that belonged to the town was present, and set on the sills at once. The second meeting house was built about the year 1719 ; its di mensions were 50 feet in length and 35 in breadth. In 1745, an addition of 15 feet was made to the whole Iront of the house. About the year 1762, religious controversy be gan in this town, and was carried to a great extent for many years. It is presumed * Robbins' Century Sermon, 1801."], [381, "363 DANBURY. that in no town in the state, has there been more religious contention than in this. It is hoped the flame is now mostly buried, never to break forth again. At the time above mentioned, Mr. White, having altered his sentiments and preaching, in several particulars, some uneasiness arose among his people. The efforts of several ecclesi astical councils to heal the division proving ineffectual, it finally issued in the dismis sion ofMr. White from his pastoral charge, March, 1764. A major part osthe mem bers of Mr. White's church, joined with him in denying the jurisdiction of ecclesiasti cal councils, and renouncing the form of church government established by the churches in this state. The remaining part, who signified their adherence to the ec clesiastical government, were established and acknowledged by the two consociations of Fairfield county, convened in council, as the first church in Danbury. Soon after this, Mr. White and his adherents separated from the church and society, and formed a separate church: they were generally denominated ' Mr. White's adherents.' In October, 1770, a number of the inhabitants of the town, individually named in the act, principally those who composed this separate church, were incorporated a society by name of ' New Danbury.' Prior to this, they built a good meeting house, its dimen sions about 50 feet by 40, in the year 1768, which was consumed in the general confla gration osthe town. In the same year, Mr. Ebenezer Russel White was ordained a colleague with his father, over that church.\" \u2014 Robbins' Century Sermon. Southeastern view of the Borough of Danbury. Danbury is bounded n. by New Fairfield, e. by Brookfield and New town, w. by Ridgefield, and s. by Reading. Its length is about 8_ miles, and its breadth more than 6. It has a fertile soil, pleasantly di versified with hills and valleys, and some moderate ridges, running in a northerly and southerly direction. By an act of the General Assembly in May, 1784, this town was made a half-shire of the county of Fair field. From that time to the present, the courts have set alternately in Fairfield and Danbury. The above shows the appearance of the borough of Danbury, as it is seen from the south, upon the Norwalk road. The main street, on which the borough is principally built, is one mile and a quarter in ex tent, thickly settled on both sides for that distance. The village is situ ated in a narrow but pleasant valley : a gentle eminence rises immediately westward of the main street, called Deer hill; a much smaller one rises eastward, called the Town hill. The village contains six houses of wor ship ; 1 Congregational, 1 Episcopal, 1 Baptist, 1 Methodist, 1 Univer-"], [382, "364 DANBURY salist, and 1 Sandemanian. The Baptist church is seen in the engra ving on the extreme left, situated on Deer Hill. The Episcopal church is at the south end of the village, and is one of the most prominent build ings in the view. This building is one of the oldest in the town ; it was built in 1763, and is one osthe few which escaped the general confla gration by the British troops in 1777. The next spire seen eastward of this, is that of the Universalist church, near which is seen that of the court house : the Congregational church is seen in the distance, on the extreme right. The village is 22 miles north from Norwalk, 36 from New Haven, 36 from Litchfield, 55 from Hartford, 65 n. e. from the city of New York, and 5 miles from the New York state line. The borough contains nearly 200 dwelling houses, besides numerous other buildings ; 9 mercantile stores, 1 printing office, an academy, &sc. In the first society of Danbury, there are 24 hatting shops or factories. Two hundred and eighty nine persons are employed, who manufacture 134,000 hats annually, the estimated value of which is \u00a3402,000. South view of the central part of the Borough of Danbury It is in contemplation to construct a rail road to Norwalk, or some other place in that vicinity ; the route is quite feasible, and it is believed will add much to the prosperity of Danbury. The above is a southern view of the centra] part of the borough of Danbury, as seen from Deer hill, the elevated ground which rises im mediately westward of the street. The building a little to the left of the central part of the engraving, having the most elevated spire, is the Universalist church, the first building to the left of which is the Acad- BT^'i. -The J3'1 'S the firSt building t0 the right of the church, back of which is seen the ancient burying ground of Danbury, in which are the graves of Gen.

In the latter part of the year 1776, the commissioners of the Ameri can army chose Danbury for a place of deposit for military stores A large quantity having been collected, Gov. Tryon, with a detachment"], [383, "365 DANBURY. of 2,000 men from New York, sailed to Compo Point in Fairfield, and proceeded directly to Danbury, to destroy the continental stores. There were in the town a small number of continental troops, but without arms ; they with the inhabitants generally withdrew from the town as the en emy approached. The enemy entered the town on Saturday the 26th of April, 1777, at about three o'clock in the afternoon. They soon began those cruelties and excesses which characterize an unprincipled and exasperated enemy, upon the inhabitants who remained in the town, excepting the persons and property of the tories. The enemy, fearful that their retreat might be cut off, rallied early in the morning of the 27th, set fire to several stores and buildings, and immediately marched out of town. \" Nineteen dwelling houses, the meeting house of the New Danbury society, and twenty two stores and barns, with all their contents were consumed. The quantity of continental stores which were consumed, cannot now be accurately ascertained : accounts vary considerably. From the best information which can be obtained, there were about 3,000 barrels of pork, more than 1,000 barrels of flour, several hundred barrels of beef, 1,600 tents, 2,000 bushels of grain, besides many other valuable articles, such as rum, wine, rice, army car riages, &.C.\"* The following is an account of the private losses sustained by indi viduals in the town of Danbury, in consequence of the enemy's incur sion in that place ; according to an estimate made thereof by a com mittee appointed to apprize the same ; with the names of thosq who were principal losers. \u00a3. s. d.

Id. lawful money, lost by individuals in consequence of that town being made the repository of public stores. There is therefore the greatest rea son that the public should not only grant speedy relies to the sufferers, (marry of whom are reduced to extreme want,) but also that they should have the public faith pledged for the amount of those losses; which were estimated not according to the exorbitant prices at the present' time, but in most instances as the articles cost before this war commenced. Col. Cook appears to have been in the command at Danbury, at the time it was burnt. Receiving some notice of the landing or approach of the enemy, he immediately dispatched a messenger by the name of Lambert Lockwood, with a letter to Gen. Silliman, informing him that there was no ammunition in the place, and requesting orders. The messenger, before he was aware of it, came up with the British troops in the vicinity of Reading church, about 8 miles below Danbury; he attempted to flee, but was fired upon, wounded, and taken prisoner. * Robbins' Century Sermon."], [384, "366 * ANBURY. Tryon, it appears, had, a few years previous, broke down his carriage while passing through Norwalk. Mr. Lockwood, being then a clerk in a store in that place, rendered Tryon some assistance, and being recog nized by him, on account of his services on that occasion, Tryon, on his leaving Danbury, intended to give him a furlough ; while he was wri ting it, one of Tryon's officers came in, exclaiming, \" the d \u2014 d rebels are upon us, we must be off;\" Tryon threw down his pen, and left his prisoner to take care of himself. As the British were entering Danbury, a Mr. Hamilton, who had a roll of cloth in some building near the Episcopal church, was deter mined at much hazard to secure it ; he accordingly went to the place where it was, took it, and being on horseback rode off. The enemy's light horsemen followed hard after, exclaiming, we'll have you, old daddy ! we'll have you ! Not yet ! replied the old gentleman. The light horsemen rode up and endeavored to cut him down, but the old gentleman's cloth began to unroll and fly out behind ; this so frightened their horses, that they could not get within striking distance ; they how ever chased him through nearly the whole extent of the street. Mr. Hamilton turning a short corner near the north end of the street, the horsemen gave up the pursuit. Three or four men in or near Capt. Starr's house, which was situated on the west side of the street, about 40 rods above the present court house, had the temerity to fire upon the enemy ; the light horsemen rode up and cut them down, threw their bodies into the house, and set it on sire. The present Episcopal church was filled up to the galleries with barrels of pork and flour ; these were rolled out into the street by the enemy and burnt. It is said that it was over one's shoes in the street near by, with pork fat, after (the conflagration. The following account osthe expedition osthe British to Danbury, &ic. in April, 1777, is from the Connecticut Journal. \"On Friday, the 25th instant, twenty six sail of the enemy's ships appeared off Nor walk Islands, standing in for Cedar Point, wheret hey anchored at 4 o'clock, P.M. and soon began landing troops ; by 10 o'clock they had landed two brigades, consisting of upwards of two thousand men, and marched immediately for Danbury, where they arrived the next day at 2 o'clock, P. M. \" The handful of continental iroops there were obliged to evacuate the town, hav ing previously secured a part of the stores, provisions, &c. The enemy on their arri val began burning and destroying the stores, houses, provisions, &c. \" On the appearance osthe enemy, the country was alarmed. Early the next morn ing, Brigadier General Silliman, wilh about five hundred militia, (all that were col lected,) pursued the enemy; at Reading, he was joined by Major General Wooster, and Brigadier General Arnold. The heavy rain all ihe afternoon, retarded the march of our troops so much that they did not reach Bethel, (a village two miles from Dan bury,) till 11 o clock at night, much fatigued, and their arms rendered useless by being wet It was thought prudent to refresh the men, and attack the enemy on their return. Early the next morning (which proved rainy,) the whole were in motion, two hun dred men remained with Gen Wooster, and about four hundred were detached under General Arnold and General Silliman, on the road leading to Norwalk. At 9 o'clock A- ,f \u00c6r WaS rwVed that the enemy had taken lhe \u2122d fading to Nor walk, of which General Wooster was advised, and pursued them, with whom he <-ame up about 11 o clock, when a smart skirmishing ensued, in which General Woos! le\\\\ W,Urr,-,t ,1 T f -T ,mt7Pldli>'. \"\"fortunately received a wound by a musket ball, thro the groin, which it is feared will prove mortal. Gen.

At noon they began discharging their artillery, and were soon within musket shot, when a smart action ensued between the whole, which continued about an hour, in \u25a0which our men behaved with great spirit, but being overpowered by numbers, were obliged to give way, though not until the enemy were raising a small breastwork, thrown across the way, at which Gen. Arnold had taken post with about 200 men, (the rest of our small body were posted on the flanks,) who acted wilh great spirit ; the general had his horse shot under him, when the enemy were within about ten yards of him, but luckily received no hurt; recovering himself, he drew his pistol and shot the soldier, who was advancing with his fixed bayonet. He then ordered his troops to retreat through a shower of small and grape shot. In the action the enemy suffered very considerably, leaving about thirty dead and wounded on tbe ground, beside a number unknown buried. Here we had the misfortune of losing Lieut. Col. Gold, one subaltern, and several privates killed and wounded. It was found impossible to rally our troops, and Gen. Arnold ordered a stand to be made at Saugatuck bridge, where it was expected the enemy would pass. \" At 9 o'clock A. M. the 28th, about 500 men were collected at Saugatuck bridge, including part of the companies of Col. Lamb's battalion of artillery, with three field pieces, under command of Lieut. Col. Oswald, a field piece with part of the artillery company from Fairfield, sixty continental troops, and three companies of volunteers from New Haven, with whom Generals Arnold and Silliman took post about two miles above the bridge. Soon after the enemy appeared in sight, their rear was attacked by Col. Huntington (commanding a party of about 500 men,) who sent to Gen. Arnold for instructions, and for some officers to assist him. Gen. Silliman was ordered tn his assistance ; the enemy finding our troops advantageously posted made a halt, and after some little time, wheeled off to the left and forded Saugatuck river, three miles above the bridge. Gen. Arnold observing this motion, ordered the whole to march directly for the bridge, in order to attack the enemy in the flank, Gen. Silliman at the same time to attack their rear : the enemy, by running full speed, had passed the bridge on Fairfield side with their main body, before our troops could cross it. Gen. Silliman finding it impossible to overtake the enemy on their route, proceeded to the bridge, where the whole were formed; they marched in two columns, with two field pieces on the right, the other on the left of the enemy, when a smart skirmishing, and firing of field pieces ensued, which continued about three hours. The enemy having gained the high hill of Compo, several attempts were made to dislodge them, but without effect. The'enemy landed a number of fresh troops to cover their embarka tion, which they effected a little before sunset, weighed anchor immediately, and stood across the Sound, for Huntington on Long Island. Our loss cannot be exactly ascer tained, no return being made. It is judged to be about sixty killed and wounded. Among the killed are 1 Lieut. Colonel, 1 Captain, 4 Subalterns, and Doct.

John Lamb, (of artillery,) Arnah Bradley and Timo thy Gorham, volunteers from New Haven, though not mortally. \" The enemy's loss is judged to be more than double our number, and about 20 pri soners. The enemy on this occasion behaved with their usual barbarity, wantonly and cruelly murdering the wounded prisoners who fell into Iheir hands, and plunder ing the inhabitants, burning and destroying every thing in their way. The enemy, tbe day before they left Fairfield, were joined by ten sail, chiefly small vessels.\" During the Revolution, a hospital for the American army was kept for some time at Danbury. Two buildings, each about 60 feet in length. were built for that purpose ; they were situated about three fourths of a mile northwest from the court house, on land now owned by Samuel Wildman, Esq. Mr. Wildman lived in Danbury at the time it was burnt, and from him many of the foregoing particulars are derived. Many of the sick were brought from White Plains ; about 200 soldiers were buried near the hospital. A large proportion of the sick were soldiers from the south, who were not used to the rigors of a northern climate. \" In 1775, a dysentery raged in all parts osthe town. The number of deaths in the town, during the year, was about 130, of which 82"], [386, "368 DANBURY. were in the limits of the first society. Says Mr. Baldwin, in his Thanksgiving sermon of that year, 'no less than 62 have been swept away from within the limits of the society in less than eleven weeks, the summer past; and not far from 50 in other parts of the town. Much the greater part of this number were children.' A remarkable fact occurred that year. A military company of about 100 men was raised in the town, and ordered to the northern army on Lake Cham plain. When they went, it was viewed by their friends as next to a final departure. At the conclusion of the campaign, they all returned safely, and found that great numbers of their friends, had sunk in death. The disorder had subsided before their return.\" Sandemanian Church, Danbury. Tbe above is a north view of the Sandemanian church, situated near the northern part of the village of Danbury. It is a small, unostenta tious building, placed a little back of the other buildings on the main street, and very much resembles a common school house. It is be lieved to be the only house of worship now used by that denomination in this country. In 1764, Mr. Robert Sandeman, a native of Perth, in Scotland, a man of learning, and superior abilities, who had some correspondence with Mr. White, and some other ministers in this country, came from his native land, landed at Boston, and came to Danbury near the close of the year. After tarrying several weeks, he returned to Boston, where he soon organized a church. He returned to Danbury and gathered a church, in July, 1763. \" The principal doctrines which he taught were similar to those of Calvin and Athanasius, which have been received in all ages of the Christian church. His distinguishing tenet was, that faith is a mere intellectual belief: his favorite expression was, ' a bare belief of the bare truth.' He maintained that his church was the only true church, then arisen from the ruins of Antichrist, his reign being near a close. The use of means, for mankind in a natural state, he"], [387, "369 DANBURY. pretty much exploded.\" Mr. Sandeman died in 1771. The next year his church moved to New Haven. There it appears they were in a flourishing condition for three or four years. The house in which they assembled for worship is still standing in Gregson street. When the Revolutionary war broke out, the Sandemanians, who were royalists, became objects of suspicion. They were brought before the civil au thority on several occasions, and at one time were imprisoned. These proceedings had the effect to break up their church in this place; nearly, if not quite all their people moved away. \" In July, 1774, several persons who had been members of that church, together with a number who belonged to the society at New Danbury, united and formed a new Sandemanian church. That continued and increased for many years, till March, 1798, when they divided into two churches.\" The following is from a recent account given of the Sandemanians in this place. \" They meet on the Sabbath, and the Thursday afternoon of each week, to exhort and to explain the sacred word. Their church is provided with a large circular table, which occupies nearly half of the area of the building, at which the several members seat themselves, each one provided with a copy of the scriptures, and as they individ ually feel disposed, they read and comment thereon, the females ex cepted. They appear to worship by themselves, the congregation not partaking therein, being but indifferent spectators of the proceedings. They also add to their former exercises prayer and singing ; and after which, they assemble at one or the other of the brothers' or sisters' houses, where they partake of a feast There are probably, at present, about twenty primitive followers, of strict morals and chaste deportment, even to a proverb. It appears that none have joined them latterly. This sect, like most others, have had divisions among them, one party of which now go by the name of the Osbornites, from Mr. Levi Osborn, their present teacher. These are very few in number, re duced by deaths, and from the circumstance of none uniting with them. The other party go by the name of Baptist Sandamanians, from their belies in and practice of baptism. The Osbornites appear to have been the most numerous of the two classes, having had formerly a consider able number of members, consisting of some respectable people of in fluence.\" There are said to be but about 400 persons of this denomi nation in the world, 40 of whom are in the United States. Those of this belief in Great Britain, are known by the name of Glassites. The following is copied from the monument of Mr. Sandeman, in the burying ground opposite the court house. Here lies, until the resurrection, the body of Robert Sandeman, a native of Perth, North Britain, Who in the face of continual opposition from all sorts of men long boldly contended for the ancient Faith, that the bare work of Jesus Christ, without a deed or thoughl on the part of man, is sufficient to present the chief of sinners spotless before God. To declare this blessed Truth, as testified in the Holy Scriptures, He left his country, he left his Friends, and alter much patient suffering, finished his la bors at Danbury, April 2, 1771, \u00c6. 53 years. Deign'd Christ to come so nigh to us. As not to count it shame, To call us Brethren, should we blush At aught that bears his name ?

The flourishing village of Bethel, in the town of Danbury, is situated about three miles southeast from Danbury. The view shows the ap pearance of the Congregational church, and some other buildings in the vicinity. This church was erected in 1760, being the first meeting house erected here ; the Rev. Noah Wetmore was the first minister; he was regularly dismissed from his pastoral charge in 1784. Bethel was incorporated as a society in October, 1759. There are at this time, (1835,) about fifty dwelling houses in the village ; the lead ing branches of manufacturing business, at present, are hat and comb making. An Episcopal church, about fifty rods s. w. of the Congre gational church, has been erected the present year, besides many other buildings. There are in Bethel, 15 hatting shops or factories, which employ, (including females,) 200 persons; they manufacture about 125,000 hats annually, which are valued, at wholesale prices, at about $200,000. There are about 12 principal comb manufacturers, who employ about 180 persons in the business. The \"Hatter's circular Dye Kettle and Wheel,\" was invented in Danbury in 1823, by Mr. Joel Taylor. It is a most important invention for hatters, and has come into general use both in this country and Europe."], [389, "371 BRIDGEPORT. The British troops, in their expedition to Danbury, passed through this village ; the following incident is said to have occurred here at that time. As the British were descending the hill, a short distance from the village, on the old Reading road, one of the inhabitants of the town, Mr. Luther Holcomb, rode his horse up to the summit of an eminence in front of the enemy. Although entirely alone, Mr. Holcomb, (judging from the words he used,) evidently intended to make an impression. Waving his hat or sword, and turning bis face as though he was ad dressing an army behind him, he exclaimed in a voice of thunder, \"Halt the whole Universe! break off by kingdoms !\" This, it must be confessed, was a formidable force to encounter. The British army came to a halt, their cannon were brought forward and made to bear upon their supposed opponents, and flanking parties sent out to make discoveries. Mr. Holcomb, on the point of being surrounded, and deem ing \" discretion the better part of valor,\" thought it advisable to make good his retreat in a rapid manner towards Danbury.

It is mostly built on the west side of an arm osthe sea, 17 miles s.w. from New Haven, 62 miles from New York, and 4 from Fairfield. The harbor extends about three miles inland to the bead of tide water, where it meets Pe quanock river, a considerable mill stream. The average width of the harbor, at high water, is eighty rods. At low water most of it is bare, leaving a channel about a dozen rods wide ; common tides rise seven feet, spring tides nine. The depth of water on the bar, at high water, is about thirteen feet ; within the bar the water is much deeper, having a muddy bottom. The bridge across the harbor is about one mile and"], [391, "Is-ntim by .l.W.lttir/'rr.Mari-Ii 1331.

The surface on which the town is principally built, is a plain about 12 feet above high water mark. There is however a rise called Golden hill,* commencing about 100 rods northwest of the center of the present buildings, which, after a gradual ascent of about 20 rods, in which the perpendicular elevation is 50 feet, presents a surface of half a mile square, forming a delightful situation for an upper town : from this elevation is a fine prospect of the Sound and surrounding scenery. Though situated within three miles of Stratford, and four of Fairfield, both among the earliest settlements in the state, at the close of the Revolutionary war there were but 10 or 12 houses on the site where Bridgeport is now built. In 1790, there were but 110 inhabitants; in 1830, there were upwards of 1,800 in the borough. The number of inhabitants at this time, (1837,) in the city, is 3,416. South vieiv of ihe Churches in Bridgeport. The original name of the village, (now city,) was Newfield, which in 1800 was incorporated as a borough, and called Bridgeport. There are five churches in the limits osthe city; 1 Episcopal, erected in 1801, now (1837) used by the Baptists ; 2 Congregational \u2014 the first Congre gational church was erected in 1803, by the society formerly worship ing in Stratfield, the other in 1830; the Methodist church, erected in 1822 ; and the present Episcopal church, now building. The ancient meeting bouse of the parish of Stratfield stood about one mile and a half northwest of the central part of the city, on the line road between Fair field and Bridgeport ; it was taken down a year or two since.

The first newspaper printed in the village was in 1795, and edited by Lazarus Beach. The first bridge was erected across the harbor in 1783. There are two banks in this place, the Bridgeport and Connec- ticut banks, the former incorporated in 1806, the latter in 1831. The number of inhabitants within the limits of the town, at this time, is es timated at upwards of four thousand. A daily line of steamboats, to ply between Bridgeport and New York, was established in July, 1834. Among the principal articles manufactured in this place, are saddlery and carriages. The whale fishery, of late, has received considerable attention. Bridgeport, at this time, is rapidly increasing in wealth and population. A charter was granted in 1836 for a rail road, called the \" Housatonic Rail Road,\" following the valley of the Housatonic, about eighty five miles, to West Stockbridge, Mass. From the Connecticut Journal, Dec. 15, 1779. On the 4th ult. about 25 volunteers, under the command of Captains Lockwood, Hawley, Jones, and Lieutenants Jackson and Bishop, set off from Newfield harbor on an expedition to Long Island, to fetch off Thomas Jones, Esq., one of the judges of their Supreme Court, and a warm Loyalist ; they crossed the Sound that evening, ar rived at Stony Brook near Smith Town, and then marched to Fort Nick, (said Jones' place of residence,) where they arrived the 6th, about 9 o'clock in the evening, being 5'2 miles, and after surprising the house, look said Jones prisoner ; in consequence of which an alarm arose ; which obliged our men to retreat, traveling 50 miles the same night, and secreting themselves the next day ; (by which time the enemy's light horse were near,) the following evening they retreated to their boats, having taken two pris oners more, crossed the Sound and arrived safe at Black Rock, in Fairfield, on the 8th ; except six men, who being in the rear, were taken by the light horse. The object osthe above expedition appears to have been the capture of some person of sufficient rank to exchange for Gen. Silliman, who was captured by the enemy a short time previous. The following is from the 3d vol. of Dwight's Travels. In 1779, Major General Silliman was appointed by the governor and council of safety, superintendant of the coast osthe county of Fairfield. In the month of May, Sir Henry Clinton directed a small company of refugees to cross the Sound in a whale boat from Lloyd's Neck, and if possible to lake him a prisoner. One of them was an inhabitant ofNewtown named Glover, a carpenter ; who hadbeen employed by General Silliman not long before ; and having been some time at the house was perfectly ac quainted with the safest and easiest modes of access to it. The crew consisted of nine. One was left in the boat. Eight came to the house about midnight. The family were awakened by a violent assault upon the door. General Silliman sprang out of bed, seized a musket, and ran to the door. As he passed by the window he saw the men, and at once comprehended their design. He then attempted to fire his musket ; but it only flashed. At that instant the assailants broke through the window and laid their hands upon him, exclaiming that he was their prisoner, and that he must go wilh them. At his request they permitted him to dress himself, and having plundered him of alusee, a pair of pistols, a sword and some other articles of no great value, proceed ed with expedition to the shore. They reached it about two o'clock, and immediately embarked for Long Island As they approached the shore of Lloyd's Neck, Colonel Simcoe the commanding officer, who was waiting for them exclaimed, ' Have you got him, They answered Yes, Have you lost any men,' No, ' That is well, your Sillimins are not worth a man, nor your Washinglons.' General Silliman's eldest son was taken with him. The prisoners were ordered to the guard-house. The General asked the"], [395, "BROOKFIELD. 375 Adjutant whether this was the manner they treated prisoners of his rank. The Ad jutant replied, ' We do not consider you in the same light as we should a continental General. How, said General Silliman, will you view me when an exchange shall be proposed! ' I understand you,1 said the Adjutant, and withdrew. These questions probably preserved General Silliman from the indignity of being confined in a guard house. Soon after, he and his son were conducted in a carriage to New York, under an escort of Dragoons. On his arrival a numerous body of people gathered lo see bim. A gentleman who was a friend to him, advised him to withdraw lest he should be insulted, and very kindly conducted him to good lodgings. Here he remained for some time and was at length ordered to Flaibush. At that time there was no prisoner in the possession of the Americans, whom the British would accept in exchange for General Silliman ; and after some consideration, it was determined to procure one. The person pitched upon was the Hon. Mr. Jones, one osthe justices osthe Supreme Court of the province of New York. Capt. Daniel Hawley of Newfield (now Bridgeport,) undertook to accomplish the design. Having selected a proper crew, he proceeded in a whale boat lo Long Island, and having land ed his men, concealed his boat in some bushes near the shore. Osthe place where they landed I am ignorant; but it is said to have been at least fifty miles from the place of their destination. The house of Judge Jones stood, and probably now stands, on the north side of Hempstead plain, in a solitude rather pleasant, and certainly very favor able to their enterprise. The Americans arrived about nine o'clock in the evening. There was a ball in the house, and the noise of music and dancing prevented tbe ap proach of the adventurers from being heard. Captain Hawley knocked at the door, and perceiving that nobody heard him, forced it, and found Judge Jones standing in the entry. He instantly told him he was his prisoner, and immediately conducted him off, together with a young gentleman whose name was Hewlett. A guard of sol diers were posted at a small distance from their road. When they came near the spot, Judge Jones hemmed very loud, and was forbidden by Captain Hawley to repeat the sound. He however did repeat it, but, being told by his conductor that another repe tition would be followed by fatal consequences, he desisted. On their way they were obliged to lodge in a sorest through the day. The third night they reached their boat, and proceeded immediately to Newfield. Mrs. Silliman, hearing of Judge Jones' arrival, sent him an invitation to breakfast. He came. During several days while he was at her house, she took all the measures in her power to make his situation agreeable. But although few ladies could contrib ute more effectually to such a purpose, the Judge was distant, reserved and sullen. From this place he was ordered to Middletown. It was a long time before the British would consent to an exchange; but in the month of May, 1780, they agreed that if one Washburn, a refugee of a notoriously bad char acter, could be included in the exchange as a kind of make-weight, they would release General Silliman for Judge Jones, and his son for Mr. Hewlett. The vessel which conveyed him met another, employed to transport General Silliman to his own house, on the Sound. The two gentlemen having dined together, proceeded immediately to the respective places of their destination. The General's return was welcomed with demonstrations of joy by all the surrounding country. BROOKFIELD. Brookfield was incorporated as a town in 1788 ; it was formed from parts of New Milford, Danbury and Newtown. It was formerly called the society of Newbury. The Rev. Thomas Brooks was the first minister in the place, and was ordained Sept. 28th, 1758, a church beino- o-athered at the same time. Brookfield is said to have been named from tbe first minister. The town is bounded n. by New Mil ford, n. e. by the Housatonic river, s. e. by Newtown, w. by Danbury and New Fairfield. The township is equivalent to about 17 square miles, containing about 11,000 acres. The surface is diversified with hills and valleys, and the soil is generally a dry, hard, gravelly loam, particularly upon the hills ; the lands generally are well adapted to a grain culture. In some sections of the town there is limestone, and several beds of marble."], [396, "376 D A RI E N. Northern view of Brookfield, [central part.) The above is a representation of the central part of Brookfield. There are about 20 dwelling houses at this place ; 2 churches, 1 Con gregational and 1 Episcopal, and a town house. The Congregational church is the first building on the right with a spire ; the Episcopal church is the next building seen eastward, with four windows on the north side. The town house is seen on the east side of the street, with a small spire. These buildings stand on elevated ground, on the sum mit of a rocky ridge running north and south. About one mile and a half to the northwest there are iron works, and some other manufac turing business is carried on, with a village about the size of the one at the town center. There has been lead discovered about 40 rods south of the Episcopal church. The central part of the town is about six miles N. e. from Danbury, and twenty four from Fairfield. D ARIEN. This is a small township, formerly the parish of Middlesex, in the town of Stamford. It is bounded n. by New Canaan, e. by Norwalk, w. by Stamford, and s. by Long Island sound. It was incorporated as a town in 1820. The soil is generally a rich gravelly loam, fertile, and well adapted to tillage and grazing. The following is a representation of the Congregational church in Da rien, 5 miles southwest of Norwalk. It stands a few rods to the left, as you pass the main road to Stamford : this church was erected in 1740. During the Revolutionary war, a considerable number of persons dis affected to the American cause resided in this vicinity. On Sunday, the 22d day of July, 1781, a party of British troops, consisting chiefly of refugees, surrounded this church and took the congregation prisoners. The Rev. Moses Mather, D. D. was at this time pastor of the church,"], [397, "377 D A R I E N. Southwestern view osthe Congregational Church, Darien. a divine distinguished for his piety, learning, and most exemplary life. It was the intention of the refugees, of tories, to have taken the con gregation prisoners during the morning services, but some members of the congregation who were peculiarly obnoxious to them, not attending church in the forenoon, they kept concealed till the afternoon services commenced. While the congregation were singing the first time, the refugees, commanded by a Capt. Frost, sprung over the fence and sud denly surrounded the house. Two or three young men, who happened to discover them in season, jumped out of the windows and effected their escape. Two guns were fired at them by the refugees, who did not think it prudent to fire any more, as the firing of three guns would have been the signal of alarm agreed upon by the inhabitants of this place, to give notice of any invasion of the enemy. The men of the congregation were taken out of the church, tied two and two, and Dr. Mather was placed at their head. The refugees then took about forty horses belonging to the congregation, mounted them, and marched their prisoners to the shore ; and thence conveyed them to Lloyd's Neck on Long Island. From this place they were soon after marched to New York, and confined in prison. Some osthe congregation who were taken off, never returned ; these probably perished in prison, others were paroled, and some returned after having suffered severely by the small pox. A writer in one of the British publications osthe day, in giving an account of this expedi tion, made himself merry in describing the outcry which the women and children made at the time the men were taken prisoners, as though it were nothing to have husbands, fathers, and brothers, separated from them by an armed enemy, and taken off to a distant prison. The son of Dr. Mather was more fortunate than the rest ; as the refugees entered tbe church, he sprung under the seat, and the women sitting before him, their clothes hid him from observation. 48"], [398, "378 D ARI E N. \" Dr. Mather having been taken into New York, was confined in the Provost prison. Here his food was stinted, and wretched to a degree not easily imaginable. His lodging corresponded with his food. His company, to a considerable extent, was made up of mere rabble ; and their conversation, from which he could not retreat, composed of pro- faneness and ribaldry. Here also he was insulted daily by the provost marshal, whose name was Cunningham, a wretch, remembered in this country only with detestation. This wretch, with other kinds of abuse, took a particular satisfaction in announcing, from time to time, to Dr. Mather, that on that day, the morrow, or some other time at a little distance, he was to be executed.\" \" But Dr. Mather was not without his friends ; friends, however, who knew nothing of him, except his character. A lady of distinction,* hav- ing learned his circumstances, and having obtained the necessary per- mission, sent to him clothes and food, and comforts, with a very liberal hand.\" \u2014 Dr. Mather died Sept. 21st, 1806, venerated by all who knew him, in the 88th year of his age. He was educated at Yale College, of which he was a fellow thirteen years. From the Connecticut Journal, Sept. Oth, 1779. The Rev. Mr. Mather of Stamford, and two of his sons, are lately returned from captivity at New York. Mr. Mather was mken from his own house about five weeks since, with four of his sons, by a gang of eight tories, five of whom had been his pa rishoners. The other two sons are not exchanged. July 26, 1781. Sunday last, in the afternoon, a party of the enemy surprised the congregation of the parish of Middlesex, between Norwalk and Stamford, while attending divine ser vice in the meeting house, and made prisoners of about forty, including the Rev. Mr. Mather, minister osthe parish. The surprise was so complete that only 4 or 5 escaped, one of them a son of Mr. Mather, who was slightly wounded in the leg, as he was run ning off. They were carried to the water side and put on board two armed vessels, which at that instant came to, supposed by previous appointment. The enemy also look away a number of horses, with saddles, &c. A few of the inhabitants collected, who exchanged some shot with the enemy, and one or two were seen to fall, but wheth er mortally wounded is not known : one prisoner was taken. The enemy's party consisted of about 40, who came over the night before from Lloyd's Neck, in seven boats, which they carried into a thick swamp near the meeting house, where they concealed themselves, until they rushed out and surprised the con gregation as above. This is the second time that Mr. Mather has been a prisoner with the enemy.

They hoisted sail, the sound they cross'd, And near Lloyd's-Neck they anchored first. Then every man must tell his name, A list they took and kept the same, Now twenty four of fifty men, Were ordered home again : The twenty-six who stay'd behind, Most cruelly they were confin'd, On board the brig were ordered quick, And were confined beneath the deck ; A nasty hole with filth besmear'd, But 'twas no more than what they fear'd. But would their joints in pieces cut, Then round the deck like devils strut. Oh, human nature, how deprav'd ! Can any mortal e're be sav'd? So void of good, and full of evil, And wholly bent to serve the devil. July the four and twentieth day, We all were sent to Oyster-Bay. * * * * We to the ferry came at last, View'd by spectators as we past : The gazing rabble, Tory throng, Would curse us as we past along. In boats the ferry soon we past, And at New York arrived at last. As thro' the streets we past along, Ten thousand curses round us rung; But some would laugh and some would snear, And some would grin, and some would lear. A mixed mob, a medley crew, I guess as e'er the devil knew. To the provost we were then hal'd, Though we of war were prisoners cali'd ; Our Irons now were ordered off, The standers by would swear and scoff. But O what company we found ; With great surprise we look'd around ! I must conclude that in this place, We found the worst of Adam's race ; Thieves, murderers, and pick-pockets too, And every thing that's bad they'd do : One of our men found to his cost, Three pounds York money he had lost ; His pockets pick'd, I guess before We had been there one single hour. * * * * Full eighteen days or something more, We fairly were exchang'd before, Of the exchange they let us know, Or from that place of bondage go, That of the number twenty-five, But just nineteen were left alive ; Four days before December's gone, In seventeen hundred eighty -one.\" * * * * But to return whence I left off, They at our misery make a scoff, Like raving devils tore about, Swearing they'd tear our vitals out; That they'd no quarter ever give, Nor let a cursed rebel live ; GREENWICH. The settlement of Greenwich was begun, after it had been pur chased of the Indians, in 1640, under the Dutch government at New York, then New Amsterdam. In 1665, it was incorporated by Gov. Stuyvesant. It was, however, originally purchased for the colony of New Haven, by Robert Feaks and Daniel Patrick. But the purcha sers violated their engagements to that colony, and together with the few inhabitants, placed themselves under the government of New Am sterdam. Tbe settlement went on heavily, until the people returned to the jurisdiction of Connecticut, then including the colony of New Haven. The Indians were hostile to the Dutch, and were not very favorably inclined towards the inhabitants. \" The war between the Dutch and Indians continuing,\" says Dr. Trumbull, \" a great and gen eral battle was fought between them, in that part of Horse neck com monly known by tbe name of Strickland's plain. The action was long and severe, both parties fighting with much obstinacy. The Dutch with much difficulty kept tbe field, and the Indians withdrew. Great numbers were slain on both sides, and the graves of the dead, for a century or more, appeared like a number of small hills.\" This battle took place in 1646."], [400, "380 GREENWICH. Greenwich is bounded on the north and west by the county of West chester in the state of New York, on tbe east by Stamford, and on the south by Long Island sound. Its average length is 8\u00a3 miles, and its breadth nearly six. The town is divided into three parishes, West Greenwich on the west, Greenwich on the east, and Stanwich, a part of which is taken from Stamford, on the north. West Greenwich is often called Horse neck, from a peninsula on the sound, formerly used as a pasture for horses. This parish is the largest, richest, and most popu lous part of the town. The township is hilly, and broken, and ledgy, in many places. After passing Byram river, the boundary between Connecticut and New York, the road passes through a tract of country unusually wild and savage in its aspect, large masses of rocks being scat tered about in great disorder. But the grounds at a short distance, both above and below the road, are smoother, and tbe soil is osthe best qual ity, and fitted for every production of the climate. There are several small streams which discharge their waters into tbe Sound on the south ern border of the town, of which Byram river and Miannus creek are the largest. There are also several landing places. Sawpitts landing is on the New York side of Byram river, where the steamboats stop to land and receive passengers. Putnam's Hill is situated in West Greenwich, about five miles west from Stamford, on the main road to New York. This place is celebrated for the daring exploit of Gen. Putnam, who descended this precipice when pursued by tbe British dragoons. The place is considerably al tered in its appearance since the Revolutionary war, by a road being blasted through the rocks at tbe summit osthe bill, and continued by a causeway to the valley below. A small Episcopal church formerly stood on the brow of the hill, a few feet south of where the road is now cut through ; and the road passed north by the bouse* seen in the en graving, and after proceeding to a considerable distance, bent again with a sharp angle to the south. Tbe members of tbe congregation who lived below the hill, in order to save tbe tedious circuit of going round in the road, when walking to the church, placed stepping stones, in number about seventy, at suitable distances, so that foot passengers could ascend the precipice, directly up to the church. On tbe left of the print is seen a range of small trees, extending from the bottom to the top of the hill ; these trees now occupy tbe place where tbe steps or stairs were situated, few or no traces of which now remain. On the approach of Gov. Tryon to this place, with a force of about fifteen hundred men, Gen. Putnam planted two iron field pieces by the meeting house, without horses or drag ropes. Having fired his cannon several times, Putnam perceiving the dragoons, (supported by the in fantry,) about to charge, ordered his men, about one hundred and fifty in number, to provide for their safety, and secured his own by plunging down the precipice at full trot. The dragoons, who were but a sword's length from him, stopped short ; for the declivity was so abrupt that * This hoose was standing during the Revolulionarv war, and is now occupied by one of the physicians of the place. The Congregational church is about 80 rods west. A new Episcopal church has been recently erected, which is still nearer."], [401, "381 GREENWICH. Southeastern view of Putnam's Hill, Greenwich. they dared not follow, and before they could gain the valley, by going round the brow of the hill in the ordinary way, be was far beyond their reach. One shot, however, osthe many fired at him, went through his bat as he was passing down the hill. It has been generally stated, that Putnam rode directly down the steps ; but those who saw him pass down the hill, say that he took a zigzag course, commencing at the barn seen in the engraving, north osthe house, and continuing south till be reached the steps, the lower ones of which he might have descended. This course would be sufficiently hazardous, and it is believed but very few men could be found who would dare make the attempt. The following is Gen. Putman's official account of the skirmish at O Horse Neck. Camp at Reading, March 2d, 1779. \" A detachment from the enemy at King's bridge, consisting of the 17th, 44th, and 57th British regiments, one of the Hessians, and two of new levies, marched from their lines for Horse neck on the evening of the 25lh ult., with an intention of sur prising the troops at lhat place, and destroying tbe salt works. \" A captain and thirty men were sent from our advanced lines from Horse neck, who discovered the enemy at New Rochelle, in advance. They retired before them undiscovered, as far as Rye neck, where it growing light, the enemy observed and al tacked them. They defended themselves as well as possible, and made their way good to Sawpitts, where they took advantage of a commanding piece of ground and' made some little stand, but the superior force osthe enemy obliged them to retire over By ram bridge, which they took up, and by that means had an opportunity of reaching Horse neck in safety. \" As I was there myself to see the situation of the guards, I had the troops formed on a hill by the meeting house, ready to receive the enemy as they advanced. They"], [402, "382 GREENWICH. came on briskly, and I soon discovered that their design was to turn our flanks and possess themselves of a defile in our rear, which would effectually prevent our retreat. I therefore ordered parties out on both flanks, with directions to give me information of their approach, that we might retire in season. In the mean time a column ad vanced up the main road, where the remainder osthe troops (amounting only to about sixty,) were posted. We discharged some old field pieces which were there, a few times, and gave them a small fire of musketry, but without any considerable effect ; the superior force of the enemy soon obliged our small detachment to abandon the place. \" I therefore directed the troops to retire and form on a hill a little distance from Horse neck, while I proceeded to Stanford and collected a body of militia and a few continental troops which were there, with which I returned immediately, and found that the enemy, (after plundering the inhabitants osthe principal part of their effects, and destroying a few salt works, a small sloop and store,) were on their return. The officer commanding the continental troops stationed at Horse neck, mistook my orders, and went much farther than I intended, so that he could not come up with them to any advantage. I however ordered the few troops that came from Stanford to pursue them, thinking they might have an opportunity to pick up some slragglers. In this I was not mistaken, as your Excellency will see by the enclosed list of prisoners. Be sides these, eight or nine more were taken and sent off, so that I cannot tell lo which particular regiments they belonged, one ammunition and one baggage wagon were taken. In the former there were about two hundred rounds of canister, grape and round shot, suited to three pounders, some slow matches, and about two hundred tubes; the latter was filled with plunder, which I had the satisfaction of restoring to the inhabitants from whom it was taken. As I have not yet got a return, I cannot tell exactly the number we lost, though I don't think more than ten soldiers, and about that number of inhabitants, but a few of which were in arms.

Tryon's expedition to Horse neck, 1779, is from the New Haven Journal. \" Extracts from two letters from Fairfield county, dated March 1st. \" The enemy have made an excursion within four miles of Stamford, by the best accounts of about 1400 or 1500, under the command of Gov. Tryon ; they reached Horse neck on Friday morning about 9 o'clock ; at Stamford they were not alarmed till 10 o'clock, notwithstanding the enemy were discovered at 9 o'clock the preceding evening by a small guard of continental troops at East Chester, under the command of Capt. Titus Watson, who were obliged to give way, though they fonght on their retreat, and some of them were wounded and taken prisoners. Capt. Watson was closely pursued by a light horseman, whom he had the good fortune to kill, and by the made his escape. Gen. Putnam was accidentally at Stamford, but the con tinental troops were too much scattered to be collected in season to oppose the enemy. About 200 militia and a few continental troops, fell in with the enemy's rear, just as they were leaving Horse neck, about the middle of the afternoon, who killed 8 oi 10 of them, and took about fifty prisoners, who had made too free with the strong liquor they had plundered. They destroyed a small salt work, and burnt a schooner which lay at Mianos creek. They plundered the inhabitants of every thing they could lay their hands on, broke windows, &c. and many families are strip't of every thing but the clothes they had on ; even the house where Gov. Tryon had his head quarters was not spared. They retreated to Rye on Friday evening, and next day to King's bridge. Their retreat was so precipitate, that they left behind two wagons loaded with plun der. We had not a man killed.\" New Haven, January 2Sth, 1778. On the 25th ult. Lieut. Barber, of Groton, in company with another officer, walked out a few miles from our camp near the Sawpitts, and on their return a party of Tories concealed, rose and fired on them with buck shot, when Lieut. Barber was shot through the body, and died immediately."], [403, "383 HUNTINGTON. HUNTINGTON. Huntington was incorporated as a town in 1789 ; and at that time included two parishes, Ripton and New Stratford. Since tbe forma tion of Monroe, Ripton constitutes the town of Huntington. It is bounded northwest by Monroe, east by the Housatonic, separating it from Derby and Orange, south by Stratford, and west by Trumbull. It averages about five miles in length and breadth. The surface is un even, being diversified with hills and valleys ; the soil is generally fer tile, being adapted to a grain culture. Agriculture is the principal business of the inhabitants. S. view of the Episcopal and Congregational Churches, Huntington. The above is a south view of the Episcopal and Congregational churches, in the central part of the town. Tbe Episcopal church is seen on the right, and the Congregational church, recently erected, is seen on the left. The Rev. Jedediah Mills appears to have been the first minister in this place ; he was ordained in February, 1724. The first meeting house was erected on Fanton hill, an elevation 80 rods or more northeast of the churches represented in the engraving. The ancient burying ground is near the place. The second Congregational church stood about 25 rods n. e. of tbe present building, which is the third. The first Episcopal church was erected in 1740. The church or society was under tbe care of Dr. Johnson until the year 1755, when the Rev. Christopher Newton was appointed their missionary. About 20 years since tbe Episcopal church, which stood on the foundations of the present building, was burnt down. It was set on fire by a gun, which was discharged at some doves on the building. This place is four miles west from Derby Landing, and twelve from Fairfield."], [404, "384 MONROE. MONROE, Was incorporated as a town in 1823. It was formerly the parish of New Stratford, in the town of Huntington. It is bounded north by Newtown, east by tbe Housatonic, south by Huntington and Trumbull, and west by Weston. Tbe town is about six miles in length from east to west, and four and a half in breadth. Tbe surface of the township is uneven, and in many parts stony and rough. The soil is good, and generally adapted to grazing. Orchards flourish well, and there is gen erally a profusion of the common fruits of the country. Agriculture is the principal business of the inhabitants. South view osthe central part of Monroe. There are two post offices in this town, one at the center, and one called the Stepney post office, in the western part of the town, about 11 miles north of Bridgeport. The principal part of the mechanical business of Monroe is performed in this vicinity. In the central part of the town, there is a small village, consisting of a dozen or more dwelling houses, two churches, one Congregational and 1 Episcopal, and an Academy or classical school. These buildings are situated around a small, open square or green. The building seen in the central part of the engraving, on the north side osthe square, is the Congregational church ; the first building seen east of tbe church is the Academy ; part of the Episcopal church is seen on the left. The classical school mentioned above was commenced in 1828, by Mr. Sam uel Beardslee, a graduate of Yale College, and has been sustained by a respectable number of pupils, from various places. This place is on an elevated situation, and tbe air is generally pure and salubrious. The township abounds in good springs of water, and is considered unusually healthy. There are 4 houses of worship ; 1 Congregational, 1 Epis copal, 1 Baptist, and 1 Methodist."], [405, "385 NEW CANAAN. Monroe is much celebrated for its extensive deposit of minerals. More than fifteen years since, a shaft was sunk a few feet, on the farm of Mr. Ephraim Lane. This revealed a rich variety of interesting min eral substances. Among them were tungsten, tellurium, native bismuth, native silver, magnetic and common iron pyrites, copper pyrites, galena, blende, tourmaline, &c. It is greatly to be desired, that this locality should be farther explored. Four miles south of this spot, is a vein of fluor spar, about two feet in width. \"The vein is much penetrated by quartz, mica, feldspar and talc, but it has been hitherto examined only on the surface. It is principally massive, and its structure fo liated or coarsely granular, but it presents well defined cubical crystals. Its colors vary from white to deep violet and purple, and are principally various shades of the two latter. But the most interesting circumstance relating to it, is its splendid phos phorescence. The light emitted when it is thrown, in a dark place, upon a hot shovel, is the purest emerald green; pieces of an inch in diameter become in a few seconds fully illuminated, and the light is so strong and enduring, that when carried into a room lighted by candles, or by the diffuse (not direct) light of the sun, they still continue distinctly luminous, and the light dies away very gradually as the mineral cools.\" Mr. Lane has also discovered on his land a locality of beryls, some of which are very large. Native sulphur has been found, near the sur face of the earth. NEW CANAAN. New Canaan was incorporated as a town in 1801. This town was formerly Canaan parish, lying in tbe townships of Norwalk and Stam ford, incorporated as a parish in 1731. The first society meeting was held July 1st, 1731. Tbe next year there were 47 members of the society \u2014 30 on the Norwalk side, and 17 on the Stamford side. Ponus street was annexed to North Stamford in May, 1788. The Rev. John Eells of Milford, was the first minister ; he was ordained in June, 1733 ; he resigned his pastoral charge in 1741. He died in New Canaan in 1785. in his 85th year. The Rev. Robert Silliman, the next pastor, was ordained in 1742, and continued in the ministry in this place till 1771. William Drummond, born and educated in Scotland, and or dained there by tbe presbytery of Ochterarder, in the synod of Perth and Sterling, was installed pastor in this place in 1772. He was dis missed and deposed from the ministry in 1777. Tbe Rev. Justus Mitchell, of Woodbury, was ordained here in 1783 ; he died suddenly in 1806. New Canaan is bounded n. by the state of New York, w. by Stam ford, s. by Stamford and Norwalk, and e. by Wilton. It is 6 miles in length, and 4 in breadth. Tbe surface of the township is mountainous, containing spines or ridges, composed of rock and stone, which extend from north to south through the town. The soil is a hard gravelly loam, being stony, but tolerably well timbered, and generally good for culti vation. The manufacture of shoes and leather is the principal manu facturing business done in the town, the yearly value of which is esti mated at 400,000 dollars. 49"], [406, "386 NEW CANAAN. East view of the central part of New Canaan. The above is an eastern view of the central part of New Canaan. The building on the extreme right, with a square tower, is the Episco pal church, recently erected ; the building seen standing nearest to it, is the town house. The Congregational church, wilh a spire, is seen on the left. This building was erected in 1752, and is the second house of worship ; the first stood a little south. The Methodist church is about half a mile south of this place. The building with a small steeple or tower, in the central part of the engraving, is the New Ca naan Academy, established in 1815. This respectable institution is now under the superintendence of Mr. Silas Davenport, who is both principal and proprietor. It stands on an elevated and commanding situation, having a fine prospect of Long Island sound and the inter vening country. This place is 5 miles n. w. from Norwalk, 37 from New Haven, and 50 from New York. About two miles north of the Congregational church, in a tract of woods, was a place of resort for all the Indians in the vicinity. There are three excavations out of the solid rock, the largest of which will contain about 8 gallons, and ano ther about 5; the third will contain about 1 quart. These cavities are on the side of a rock, one above another, the largest being at the top. Pestles, stone axes, and other Indian implements, have been found about this spot ; the rocks bear the appearance of fire. The cavities above mentioned were doubtless formed by the Indians, for the purpose of pounding or grinding their corn.

NEW FAIRFIELD. New Fairfield was granted by the General Assembly in 1707, to a number of the inhabitants of Fairfield. The town was originally four teen miles in extent from north to south. The first settlement appears to have been in the year 1730, in that part of the town called the lower seven miles. Several circumstances retarded the settlement of tbe town, for nearly thirty years after it was granted by the legislature. The Indians in this part of the colony were judged to be less friendly than usual, and there were reports of a designed attack from a large body of French and Indians from Canada. The line between Connecticut and New York was not settled till 1731. The grant by Connecticut osthe tract called the Oblong, to New York, as a compensation for lands set tled on the Sound, disappointed the proprietors, and narrowed the town ship several miles, as to its western extent. It was incorporated as a town in 1740. The first minister in the present township was the Rev. Benajah Case, who was ordained in 1742. New Fairfield is now but about five miles in extent from north to south, with an average breadth of about four and a halfmiles. It is boun ded n. by Sherman, w. by tbe state of New York, e. by New Milford, and s. by Danbury. The township is broken, having several granite ridges extending through it ; the soil is hard and gravelly. It is watered by Rocky river, a mill stream which runs in a northerly direction, and discharges itself into the Housatonic. The central part of the town is 64 miles southwest from Hartford, and 7 miles north of Danbury. NEWTOWN. The ancient Indian name of this township was Pohtatuck, being the name of a stream which intersects the town. In 1708, the General Assembly made a grant of the tract of country comprising the township, and incorporated it as a town the same year, by the name of Newtown. The principal seat of the Indians in this town appears to have been at the mouth osthe Pohtatuck, a mill stream which enters the Housatonic. The township is rather irregular in its form, being nearly a triangle in its shape. Its length from northwest to southeast averages about eight miles, with an average breadth of more than six. It is bounded n. w. by Brookfield, n. e. and e. by the Housatonic river, which se-"], [408, "388 NEWTOWN. parates it from Southbury, w. by Danbury and Reading, and s. w. by Monroe. The surface osthe town is hilly ; many osthe eminences are extensive and continuous. The soil is principally a gravelly loam, with some sections of sandy loam, generally fertile and productive. It is well adapted to the culture of grain, and is also favorable for fruit, there being many valuable orchards in the town. There are 5 churches in the town ; 2 Episcopal, 1 Congregational, 1 Baptist, and 1 Metho dist. South view of Newtown. The borough of Newtown is situated on the southern termination of a ridge of elevated land. After ascending the hill, from the south, there is a broad and level street, about eighty rods in extent. Tbe borough is mostly built on this street : there are about 40 or 50 dwell ing houses, 3 churches, 1 Congregational, 1 Episcopal, and 1 Meth odist ; and 4 mercantile stores. This place is 10 miles from Danbury, 25 from New Haven, and 22 from Fairfield. The above engraving shows the appearance of the village as it is entered from the south. The Episcopal and Congregational churches are seen at the south end of the principal street, near the southern descent of the bill. The houses are not distinctly seen, on account of the trees standino- before them. The flourishing village of Sandy Hook is situated about 1J miles n. e. osthe central part of Newtown, at the foot of a rocky eminence or bluff, from the top of which is a fine prospect of the surrounding country. A fine mill stream (the Pohtatuck) runs in a northerly course through the village, at the base of the bluff, which rises almost perpendicularly to the height of one hundred and sixty feet. Near Mr. Sanford's cotton factory, at the northern extremity of the village, some traces of coal have been discovered. The village contained\u00b0in 1834, 1 eolton, 1 hat, 1 comb and 2 woolen factories. There was"], [409, "389 NORWALK. also 1 machine shop, and 1 establishment for working brass. The vil lage contained about 50 families in 1834 ; it is at the present time rap idly increasing. The following inscriptions are from monuments in the burying ground, nearly a mile south of tbe village of Newtown. Here lyeth interred the earthly remains of the Rev. John Beach, A.

The eastern and middle parts of Norwalk appear to have been pur chased of the natives about the year 1640;* yet, for ten years, there were but a few scattering inhabitants within its limits. In 1649, upon the petition of Nathan Ely and Richard Olmstead, the Court gave liber ty for its settlement, and ordained that it should be a town by the name of Norwalk. At this period, the inhabitants consisted of about twenty * Norwalk originally included part of the present towns of New Canaan and Wil ton and part of Westport. In the ancient records, the bounds are stated to be \" from Norwalk river to Sauhatuck river, from sea, Indian one day walk into the country.\" For this tract the following articles were given, viz. \" 8 fathom wampum, 6 coats, 10 hatchels, 10 hoes, 10 knives, 10 scizers, 10 juseharps, 10 fathom tobacco, 3 kettles, 3 hands-about, and 10 looking glasses.\" The following articles were given to the In dians for the trad, \" from Norwalk river to Five mile river, from sea, Indian one day in country,\" viz. \" 10 fathom wampum, 3 hatchets, 3 hoes when ships come, 6 glasses, 12 tobacco'pipes, 3 knives, 10 drillers, 10 needles.\" The name of Norwalk is derived from the above bargain, viz. the northern bounds of the lands purchased were to ex tend from the sea one day's \" north walk\" into the country."], [410, "390 NORWALK. families. About four years after, the General Court vested them with town privileges. The town is bounded northwest by New Canaan and Wilton, west by Darien, east by Westport, and south by Long Island sound. Its length from north to south is about five miles ; its breadth may average about four. The soil is excellent. The surface of the town is une ven, being pleasantly diversified with hills and valleys. On the border of the Sound the hills are generally moderate, and in the interior more elevated.

Few richer prospects of the same extent can be found, than that which is presented from tbe neighboring eminences of this ground ; the town built in its bosom, with its cheerful spires ; the river flowing through the middle ; the farms on the bordering hills ; the rich plain that skirts the Sound, and a train of islands fronting the mouth of the river, and extending eastward five or six miles ; together with an unlimited view of the Sound, and the Long Island shore.\" Norwalk contains two considerable and flourishing villages, Norwalk borough, and the village of Old Well. Norwalk borough, (constituted as such in 1836,) is a village of upwards of 100 houses, 26 mercantile stores, 2 churches, 1 Congregational and 1 Episcopal, 1 bank, (the Fair field County bank,) and 1 extensive pottery. There are two newspa pers printed in the borough. Norwalk is a place of considerable activ ity and business, being a commercial depot and market for the northern part of the county ; a considerable proportion of the staple products being brought here for sale, or to be freighted for New York. This place is 32 miles from New Haven, 48 n. e. from New York, and 22 south of Danbury."], [411, "391 NORWALK. The village is built on both sides of a small river or creek, which is much contracted in width at the bridge which connects the two parts of the village, and the buildings on each side of the stream are so near each other, that the passage of the river from the north is not readily perceived at a short distance. Vessels drawing six feet of water can get up to the bridge, in the most compact part of the village. On the extreme right of the engraving is seen a small conical hill or elevation, on which are a number of poplars, perhaps 10 or 15 rods east of the road which passes on the east side of the creek. This elevation is called Grummon's Hill; it is celebrated as being the head-quarters of Gov. Tryon, who, seated in a chair on its summit, beheld the confla gration of this place in 1779, it is believed, with pleasure. The build ing before which a flag-staff is standing, is the old town house, north east from which are seen the spires of the Congregational and Episco pal churches. Southern view of Norwalk Town House. The above is a representation of the new town house, which is con structed of brick, erected in 1836. The old town house was pulled down in July, 1835. It had been long in a ruinous state, and much disfigured the appearance of the place. Some persons in the town, who took upon themselves the responsibility of regulating things of this nature about the town, being impatient of the \" law's delay,\" took ad vantage of the darkness of night, pulled down the obnoxious building, and piled up the rubbish by the side of the road. On the 11th of July, 1779, Norwalk was burnt by the British and tories, under Gov. Tryon. Eighty dwelling houses, 2 churches, 87 barns, 17 shops, 4 mills, and 5 vessels, were consumed. The loss of property sustained by the inhabitants, was estimated by a committee, appointed by the General Assembly for the purpose, at $116,238 66. The following account of the burning of this place was obtained from Mr. Betts, an aged and respectable inhabitant of this town, who was an eye witness to most of the facts related : \u2014 Gov. Tryon and Brigadier General Garth having laid Fairfield in ashes, crossed the Sound to Huntington bay, where they remained till"], [412, "392 NORWALK. the 11th of July. They then sailed over to Norwalk, and landed in the night, between 8 and 9 o'clock, on the plain which lies on the east side of the river. On learning this fact, the inhabitants generally fled, during the night; many of them went to Belden's hill, about five miles distant. Next morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock, Tryon arrived at Grummon's hill, which he made his head-quarters. Little opposition was made to the British troops, excepting by a company of continen- tal soldiers, about fifty in number, commanded by Captain Stephen Betts, who was soon, however, obliged to flee from the overwhelming force of Tryon, with the loss of four of his men killed. These men were buried in a lot in the northwestern part of the place, then owned by Mrs. Cannon. The first building was burnt about sunrise ; it stood near where the steamboat wharf is now constructed. Both the churches in the place, one the Congregational, the other the Episcopal, were consumed. The Congregational church was seventy feet by fifty three, and three stories in height, and had just been put in good repair; it was situated thirty or forty rods south of Grummon's hill. The Epis copal church stood on the same foundation on which the present church is built. The present building is built in the same form of the one burnt. Six houses only were left undestroyed by the enemy ; four on the east, and two on the west side of the river. One of these was saved by the intercession of a maiden lady, who personally applied to Tryon, in order to save the house. The argument which she made use of was, \" that the owner of the house was a friend to his majesty king George.\" The other five houses were probably spared from the same considera tions. The British began their retreat about noon ; the Episcopal cler gyman, and several other persons disaffected to the American cause, went off with them. The flourishing village of Old Well* is situated about 1J miles south of the central part of Norwalk borough, on the west side of the creek, Norwalk river being so called up as far as the bridge. The view shows the appearance of the village from the eastern side of the creek, on the elevated bank which rises above the flats, opposite the village. There are at present in the village 6 or 7 hat factories, 3 potteries, and a car riage making establishment. This is the principal landing place for steamboats, for Norwalk and tbe vicinity, there being a daily line from and to New York. A boat leaves Norwalk bridge every other day for New York. There are two churches in Old Well, a Congregational in the center, and a Methodist in the northern part of the place. There is a cotton factory, and a factory for manufacturing carpets, in the town. This establishment, called the \" Patent Carpet Company,\" was commenced in 1834. Their carpeting, of which they manufacture at this time about 200 yards daily, is made without spinning or weav ing, being made of felting, the material of which hats are composed. Messrs. Arnold &. Bishop are the proprietors of this establishment, which promises to be one of much importance. * This place, it is believed, received its name from an old well, from which in an cient times, vessels engaged in the West India trade, took their supplies of water."], [413, "NORWALK. 393 Eastern view of the village of Old Well, Norwalk. The following is Capt. Betts' account of the skirmish with the ene my at Norwalk, (in the secretary of state's office, Hartford.) Fairfield county, Norwalk, July 267A, 1779. Caplain Stephen Betts, of Col. Butler's Reg. in ye continental service personally appeared and made solemn oath, That on ye 11th instant, while ye enemy invaded Norwalk, he with about fifty continental troops and some militia, engaged a superior number of ye enemy, which obliged them to give way to an unequal force. As they retreated, John Waters, a continental soldier, fell into ye enemy's hands, delivered up his arms, and begged for life ; but ye enemy notwithstanding assaulted him with bay onet, which they stabbed him in sundry places, and then one of them presented his piece and aimed, as the Captain supposed, at his body, but missing that, ye ball shat tered his arm, whereupon finding no quarter, he made a strong effort to escape, which he happily effected. Soon after ye above accident, John Rich, another continental soldier, was shot so as to fall, and as the enemy were nigh, and crowded fast upon our people, he desired Capt. Betts to leave him, as they could not take him without the greatest hazard. Capt. Betts saw Rich no more, but says Capt. Eels of Col. Wyllys' Reg. told him he saw him after ye enemy had retreated, about two hours after Capt. Betts saw him. He was then dead, and ye top of his skull torn off, supposed to be blown off by a musquet to dispatch him; and further saith not. Before me, Thaddeus Betts, Justice of the Peace. The following is from Gen. Tryon's official account, published in the London Gazette, relative to the burning of Norwalk. \" Wanting some supplies, we crossed the Sound to Huntingdon, and there continu ed till the 11th, and repassing that day, anchored five miles from the bay of Norwalk. The sun being nearly set before the 54th, the Landgrave's regiment, and the Jagers were in the boats, it was near nine in the evening when I landed them in the Cow pasture, a peninsula on the east side of the harbor, within a mile and a half of the bridge, which formed the communication between the east and west parts of the vil lage, nearly equally divided by a salt creek. The king's American regiment being unable to join us before three next morning, we lay that night on our arms. In our march at the first dawn of the day, the 54th led the column, and soon fell in with the rebel outpost, and driving the enemy with great alacrity and spirit, dispossessed them of Drummond hill, and the heights at that end of the village, east and commanding the bridge. It being now but 4 o'clock in the morning, and the rebels having taken post within random cannon shot upon the hilts on the north, I resolved to halt until the second division, landed at the Old Wells, had advanced and formed the junction. 50"], [414, "394 NORWALK. Gen. Garth's division passed the bridge by 9, and at my desire proceeded to the north end osthe village, from whence, especially from the houses, there had been afire lor five hours, upon our advance guards. , The fuziliers, supported by the light infantry of the guards, began the attack, and soon cleared the quarters, pushing the main body and 100 cavalry from the northern heights, and taking one piece of their cannon. After many salt pans were destroyed, whale boats carried on board the fleet, and the magazines, stores, and vessels set in flames, with the greater part of the dwelling houses, the advanced corps were drawn back, and the troops retired in two columns to the place of our first debarkation, and, unassaulted, took ship and returned to Hun tingdon bay.\" The loss osthe British forces at Norwalk, according to Tryon's offi cial account, was 20 killed, 96 wounded, and 32 missing.

Agriculture is almost exclusively the business osthe inhabitants, who live scattered about on their farms. The two principal roads through the town pass, one through the west ern part, the other through the eastern part. There are four houses of worship, 1 Episcopal, 1 Methodist, 1 Congregational, and I Baptist. The Episcopal church is situated in the eastern part of the town, on what is called Reading ridge. Perhaps the most compactly settled part is in the vicinity of this church, which is 15 miles n. w. from Bridgeport, and 8 \\ miles from Danbury court house. The town house, Methodist and Congregational churches, are on a cross road, upwards of two miles westerly from the Episcopal church. House in Reading, (formerly Gen. Putnam's Quarters.) During the Revolutionary war, in the winter of 1779, in order to cover the country adjoining the Sound, and to support the garrison at West Point in case of an attack, Maj. Gen. Putnam was stationed in Reading. The engraving above is a representation of the house used for his head-quarters. It is situated on the Norwalk and Danbury road, about 15 miles north of Norwalk, and 3 west from the Congrega tional church. Putnam had under his orders Gen. Poor's brigade of New Hampshire, the two brigades of Connecticut, the corps of infan try commanded by Hazen,and that of cavalry by Sheldon. \" The troops, who had been badly fed, badly clothed, and worse paid, by brooding over their grievances in the leisure and inactivity of winter-quarters, began to think them intolerable. The Connecticut brigades formed a design of marching to Hart ford, where the General Assembly was then in session, and of demanding redress atthe point of the bayonet. Word having been brought to General Putnam, that the second brigade was under arms for this purpose, he mounted his horse, galloped to the can tonment, and thus addressed them: ' My brave lads, whither are you going? Do you intend to desert your officers, and to invite the enemy to follow you into the coun try ? Whose cause have you been fighting and suffering so long in \u2014 is it not your own ? Have you no property, no parents, wives or children ? You have behaved like men so far \u2014 all the world is full of your praises \u2014 and posterity will stand astonished at your deeds: but not if you spoil all at last. Don't you consider how much the"], [416, "396 READING. country is distressed by the war, and that your officers have not been belter paid than yourselves'! But we all expect better times, and thai the country will do us ample justice. Let us all stand by one another, then, and fight it out like brave soldiers. Think what ashame it would be for Connecticut men to run away from their officers After the several regiments had received the General, as he rode along the line, with. drums beating, and presented arms, the sergeants who had then the command, brought the men to an order, in which position they continued while he was speaking. When he had done, he directed the acting major of brigade to give the word for them to shoulder, march to their regimental parades, and lodge arms ; all which they ex ecuted with promptitude and apparent good humor. One soldier, only, who had been the most active, was confined in the quarter-guard; from whence, at night, he attempted to make his escape. But the sentinel, who had also been in the mutiny, shot him dead on the spot, and thus the affair subsided.\" While the troops lay at Reading, two executions took place ; one was a soldier, who was shot for desertion \u2014 the other was a Mr. Jones, of Ridgesield, a royalist, who was hung as a spy; both suffered on the same day. These executions took place on Gallows Hill, a mile or more from Putnam's head-quarters. The scene which took place at the execution of these men, is described as shocking and bloody. The man on whom the duty of hangman devolved left the camp, and on the day of execution could not be found. A couple of boys, about the age of twelve years, were ordered by Gen. Putnam to perform the duties of the absconding hangman. The gallows was about twenty feet from the ground. Jones was compelled to ascend the ladder, and the rope around his neck was attached to the cross beam. Gen. Put nam then ordered Jones to jump from the ladder. \" No, Gen. Put nam,\" said Jones, \" I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge ; I shall not do it.\" Putnam then ordered the boys before mentioned to turn tbe ladder over. These boys were deeply affected with the try ing scene ; they cried and sobbed loudly, and earnestly entreated to be excused from doing any thing on this distressing occasion. Putnam, drawing his sword, ordered them forward, and compelled them at the sword's point to obey his orders. The soldier that was shot for deser tion, was but a youth of 16 or 17 years of age. Three balls were shot through his breast ; he fell on his face, but immediately turned over on his back ; a soldier then advanced, and putting the muzzle of his gun near the convulsive body of the youth, discharged its contents into his forehead. The body was then taken up and put into a coffin ; tbe soldiers had fired their pieces so near that they set the boy's clothes on fire, which continued burning. An officer with a drawn sword stood by, while every soldier osthe three brigades, who were out on the occa sion, was ordered to march by and look at the mangled remains.* The bones of this young man were dug up a few years since for anatomical purposes. They were known to be his from the fracture osthe skull ; the bones however were of little or no use, for on exposure to the air they soon fell to pieces. * The particulars of the execution of these two persons, were derived from an aged inhabitant ot Reading, who was present on the occasion, and stood but a few feet from Jones when he was executed."], [417, "397 READING. Joel Barlow, LL. D. was a native of this town. The following biographical sketch of his life is from Pease and Niles' Gazetteer of Connecticut : \" He was born in or about the year 1755. His father, who was an independent far mer, but in moderate circumstances, died whilst he was a youth, leaving him a small patrimony, scarcely sufficient to defray the expenses of a liberal education, which he had contemplated. Having been placed in Dartmouth College in 1774, he was soon after removed from thence to Yale College, at New Haven, where he graduated in 1778. The class into which he entered was remarkable for the great promise of tal ent which many of its members disclosed, among whom Barlow always ranked con spicuous. The late Asa Spalding and Uriah Tracy, his Excellency Oliver Wol cott, Alexander Wolcott, Abraham Bishop and Josiah Meigs, were members of this class. He passed through the usual course of academic studies with great reputa tion, and at the public commencement in 1778, delivered or recited an original poem, which was the first lime he had appeared before the public in his poetical character. This effusion of his muse was soon after printed, and has been preserved in a collec tion entitled ' American Poems.' Previously to this period, and whilst Barlow was in college, the Revolutionary war commenced, and the natural ardor and enthusiasm of his mind, stimulated by the pervading spirit of liberty which characterized the times, led him to take a deep interest in a contest in which both the cause of civil lib erty and the dearest interests of his country were so intimately concerned. During the early period of the war, the militia of Connecticut constituted an important part of the army. Barlow had four brothers in the service ; and more than once during vacations, he armed himself with a musket, and joined them in the ' bloody strife,' as a volunteer. It is said he was in the battle at White Plains. \" Upon his leaving college, he commenced the study of law ; but, at the urgent soli citation and recommendation of some of his friends, he was induced to abandon this situation, and to qualify himself for, and accept the appointment of chaplain to the army. Whilst in this situation, he wrote several poetical effusions, strongly marked with patriotic and liberal sentiments, and calculated to encourage and animate the ar my, in various hardships, privations and difficulties with which they had to contend. And whilst in the army, he conceived, planned, and in part composed, the celebrated poem which he afterwards published, entitled the ' Vision of Columbus,' and which was subsequently enlarged into his great national poem, the'Columbiad.' In 1781, he took the degree of A. M. at New Haven, on which occasion he delivered a poem, en titled the ' Prospect of Peace,' which was principally embodied in the Vision of Colum bus. About the same time, he married Miss Baldwin, of New Haven, a sister of Abraham Baldwin, for many years a distinguished member of Congress from Geor gia. After the peace in 1783, Barlow being out of employment, resolved to resume the study of law, for which purpose he removed to Hartford, with the expectation, probably, of making it his residence for life. Whilst in this situation, to aid him in his finances, he, in connection with Elisha Babcock, established a weekly newspaper, called the ' American Mercury.' \" In 1787, whilst engaged in this business, he published his ' Vision of Columbus,' a patriotic and popular poem. It was dedicated to Louis XVI. and met with very flattering success, being reprinted in London within a few months ; it has since gone through a second edition in America, and one in Paris. About this period, in pursu ance of the request of the General Association of the clergy of this State, he un dertook the revision of Dr. Watts' version of the Psalms. His edition was published in 1786, and comprised several devotional pieces of his own composing. \" About the time of these publications, he disposed of his interest in the paper to Mr. Babcock, and opened a bookstore, the principal object of which was to effect the sale of his poem and edition of the Psalms. About this time, the Anarchiad was published at this place, in which Mr. Barlow is said to have taken a conspicuous part. On the 4th of Ja])\\ 1787, and whilst the Convention which framed the Constitution of the United Slates was in session at Philadelphia, he delivered an oration to the Con necticut Cincinnati. Not being satisfied with his prospects in his profession, the next year he embarked for England, as the agent of a land company, called the Ohio Company, from whence he soon proceeded to France. Whilst in France the Revo lution commenced, which led Barlow to an intimate acquaintance with most osthe leaders of the Republican party, and particularly with those which were afterwards denominated Girondists. His philanthrophy and enthusiasm in the cause of liberty led him to enter warmly into their plans, which received the support of his genius and political intelligence and experience. In 1791, he returned to England, and near the close of that year, published his ' Advice to Privileged Orders,' a work of solid merit, exposing in a forcible manner, the abuses and evils of the feudal governments"], [418, "398 READING. of Europe. In 1792, he published a small poem, entitled the ' Conspiracy of Kings. From these publications, being of apolitical nature, and from his intimacy with the leaders of opposition, or friends of reform, in England, he had become very obnox- ious to the ministerial party. Near the close of the year 1792, he returned to France, as one of a committee of the London Constitutional Society, with an address from the society to the National Convention. He was received in France with great re- spect : and, soon after his arrival, had conferred upon him the rights of a French cit- izen. The year following, he was employed, in connection with a deputation of th'' National Convention, to assist in organizing the territory of Savoy, as a department of the Republic. Whilst at Chamberry, in this territory, he wrote a political address to the people of Piedmont. In this place he amused himself in writing a mock didac- tic poem, called ' Hasty Pudding.' From Savoy he returned to Paris, where he resi- ded for about three years. During this period, he translated Volney's Ruins; being shocked at the atrocities of the Revolution, he withdrew from political affairs. \" In 1795, he was appointed by President Washington consul at Algiers, with pow- ers to negotiate a treaty with the Dey, and to redeem all American prisoners held in slavery by any osthe Barbary powers. He immediately set out upon this mission, and, crossing through Spain, arrived at Algiers, where he soon succeeded in negotiatinga treaty with the Dey, although surrounded with numerous difficulties. Early the suc- ceeding year, he negotiated a similar treaty with Tripoli, and liberated all the Amer- ican prisoners held in captivity. In 1797, he resigned his consulship and returned to Paris; and having engaged in some commercial pursuits or speculations, was very successful, and accumulated a handsome fortune. In the rupture which took place between France and the United States, Barlow exerted his influence and talents to promote an amicable adjustment ; for which end he addressed a letter to the people of the United States, upon the measures of the party then in power. This was soon fol- lowed by another, which was more abstract, and examined, in that clear and forcible manner peculiar to its author, various political topics, and particularly certain estab- lished principles of maritime law and the rights of neutrals. His views were novel and bold, and sounded upon the principles of abstract right, which he regarded as the only true policy. In 1805, after an absence of seventeen years from his native coun- try, Barlow resolved upon revisiting the scenes of his youth. He accordingly sold his real estate in France, which he had regarded as his adopted country, as long as it continued the country of liberty. After visiting different parts of the country, he purchased him a delightful situation in the vicinity of Georgetown, within the limits of the district of Columbia. Whilst in this situation, he enjoyed the society, friend- ship and esteem of Mr. Jefferson, then President of the United States; and of the other important functionaries, and characters of distinction, who were residents, or engaged in public employments at the seat of government. In 1806, he published a prospectus of a national institution, or university : to establish which, a bill was in troduced into the Senate; it met with considerable opposition ; was referred to a select committee, who never reported, and thus this great national object ended. He now devoted his attention to the revision and improvement of his favorite poem ; and in 1808, the Columbiad made its appearance, in the most magnificent volume which ever issued from an American press. The high price of this edition prevented its circu lation ; and the subsequent year, it was reprinted in two volumes. The same year, it was republished in London, in an elegant royal Svo. The Columbiad has been at- tacked in the severest manner, by critics of every rank ; but Barlow, relying upon the solid merits of the poem, and the impartial reward of posterity, either treated them with neglect or contempt. The Columbiad is an epic poem, abounding in philosophi- cal discussion, and in enlarged political and national views. It was expanded from the Vision of Columbus, which it comprises, and is the offspring of the labor of half a life. It is a great national work, and cannot fail of going down to posterity, to the latest generation. The name of Barlow will long be known and revered, when all those who have attempted to asperse it will be forgotten. After the publication of his Columbiad, he was employed in collecting materials for a general history of the Uni- ted States, a work which he had long meditated ; but whilst thus occupied, in 1811, he was appointed minister plenipotentiary to the French government; whereupon he soon embarked again for France, clothed with authority and distinguished honors. He applied himself with great diligence to the duties of his new station, and made every exertion to effect the negotiation of a treaty of commerce, and indemnity for spoliation. In October 1812, he was invited to a conference with the Emperor at Wilna. He immediately set off upon this mission, and traveled day and night ex- posed to the severe weather of a northern climate ; subject to great fatigue, and ac- commodations at the public innsbeing the most wretched, scarcely being able to obtain a wholesome meal his constitution was unable to withstand these severe trials- he \u00a3Ek,Xn a deblllty. from which he never recovered. He died December 22d, 1812, at Zarnawica, an obscure village of Poland, in the neighborhood of Cra-"], [419, "399 RIDGEFIELD. cow. America has produced few men, more justly deserving of immortality than Barlow ; and none, it is believed, who have made their title to it more sure. He lived in an eventful period, and acted a conspicuous part in both hemispheres; and as a poet, a man of science, a politician, a philosopher and philanthrophist, his name will long be revered by the friends of civil iiberty and of science, throughout the civilized world.\" RIDGEFIELD. The tract of land now Ridgefield, was called by the Indians Cau datowa, a word signifying high land, from its elevated situation afford ing a prospect of Long Island for forty miles. In 1708, John Belden, Samuel Keeler, Matthew Seymour, Matthias St. John, and other in habitants of Norwalk, to the number of twenty five, purchased a large tract between that town and Danbury. The purchase was made of Catoonah, the chief sachem, and other Indians. The deed is dated the 30th of September, 1708, and at the ensuing session of the General Assembly, it was incorpoaated as a town, by the name of Ridgefield. This township is of an oblong shape, about 13 miles in length from north to south, with an average breadth of about three miles. It is boun ded north by New Fairfield, west by the state of New York, east by Danbury and Reading, and south by Wilton. The face of the town ship is characterized by a succession of ridges and valleys, running north erly and southerly towards Long Island sound. On some of these ridges the observer has a fine prospect of the Sound, although situated at a distance of fourteen miles ; likewise the East and West Rocks, in New Haven, and the Highlands on tbe Hudson. The soil osthe township is good for grain and grass. There are two societies or parishes, Ridge field and Ridgebury. Ridgebury comprises the north part of the town. In the first society, (Ridgefield,) there is a pleasant village on one street, within the limits of about a mile, of about 60 dwelling houses, 3 churches, 1 Congregational, 1 Episcopal, and 1 Methodist. There is an extensive carriage factory in the village ; also one for manufacturing cabinet furniture. There are some beds of limestone in the town. Ridgebury society is a very long but narrow tract of land, gradually di minishing in width to the north, the extreme end of which is but about half a mile in width. The Rev. Samuel Camp, the first minister in Ridgebury, was ordained in January, 1769, the church being organized at the same time. The place represented in tbe view on the next page is perhaps 80 rods north osthe Episcopal church in Ridgefield, at the north end of the vil lage, on the road to Danbury. It was at this spot that the Americans, under Gen. Arnold, made a stand against the British forces, as they came down from Danbury. The house standing on the right, and fronting the south, is upwards of one hundred years old. At the settlement osthe town, the proprietors gave Mr. Stebbins, the ancestor of the late Mr. Stebbins, who occupied the house, half an acre of land, in order to in duce him to build upon it. This house has remained in possession of the family ever since."], [420, "400 RIDGEFIELD. View in Ridgefield. In order to stop the advance of the British, a barricade was thrown across the street from Mr. Stebbins' house, extending to the place where the house opposite is now built. The place where Gen. Ar nold's horse was shot, and where he killed the British soldier who was advancing towards him, is seen on the left of the engraving ; the man and boy are seen standing on the precise spot. Many of the dead and wounded were carried into the house of Mr. Stebbins, and tbe floors were literally covered with blood ; a number of the wounded died in the house. Fifteen of the British and fifteen Americans were buried near the first house now standing south of Mr. Stebbins'. Gen. Woos ter received his mortal wound about one mile and a half north, and Col. Gould was killed about eighty rods east of the house ; his body was carried to Fairfield. The British encamped over night on the high ground, nearly a mile south of the Congregational church, and when they left the place in the morning, they fired a house near by, which was supposed to be a signal for their shipping, lying on the coast near the Norwalk islands. Sarah Bishop, the hermitess, resided just over the boundary line of Ridgefield, in the state of New York. She lived on Long Island at the tirne of the Revolutionary war. Her father's house was burnt by the British, and she was cruelly treated by a British officer. She then left society and wandered among the mountains near this part of the state ; she found a kind of cave near Ridgefield, where she resided till about the time of her death, which took place in 1810. She some times came down to Ridgefield to attend public worship on the Sab bath. It is said that the wild animals were so accustomed to see her, that they were not afraid of her presence. The following account of a visit to this hermitess, is taken from a newspaper printed at Pough keepsie, in 1804. r r r s"], [421, "SHERMAN. 401 \" Yesterday I went in the company of two Capt. Smiths of this town, (N. Y.) to the mountain, to visit the hermitage. As you pass the southern and elevated ridge of the mountain, and begin to descend the southem steep, you meet wilh a perpendicular de scent of a rock, in the front of which is this cave. Al the foot of this rock is a gentle descent of rich and senile ground, extending about ten rods, when it instantly forms a frightful precipice, descending half a mile to the pond called Long Pond. In the front of the rock, on the north, where the cave is, and level with the ground, there appears a large frustrum of the rock, of a double fathom in size, thrown out by some unknown convulsion of nature, and lying in the front of the cavity from which it was rent, partly enclosing the mouth, and forming a room : the rock is left entire above, and forms the rool of this humble mansion. This cavity is the habitation osthe hermitess, in which she has passed the best of her years, excluded from all society; she keeps no domestic animal, not even fowl, cat, or dog. Her little plantation, consisting of half an acre, is cleared of its wood, and reduced to grass, where she has raised a few peach trees, and yearly plants, a few hills of beans, cucumbers, and potatoes; the whole is surrounded with a luxuriant grape vine, which overspreads the surrounding wood, and is very productive. On the opposite side of this little tenement, is a fine fountain of excellent water ; at this fountain we found the wonderful woman, whose appearance it is a little difficult to describe : indeed, like nature in its first state, she was without form. Her dress appeared little else than one confused and shapeless mass of rags, patched together without any order, which obscured all human shape, excepting her head, which was clothed with a luxuriancy of lank grey hair depending on every side, as time had formed it, without any covering or ornament. When she discovered our approach, she exhibited the appearance of a wild and timid animal; she slarted and hastened to her cave, which she entered, and barricaded the entrance with old shells, pulled from the decayed trees. We approached this humble habita tion, and after some conversation with its inmate, obtained liberty to remove the palli sadoes and look in ; for we were not able to enter, the room being only sufficient to ac commodate one person. We saw no utensil, either for labor or cookery, save an old pewter basin and a gourd shell, no bed but the solid rock, unless it were a few old rags, scattered here and there ; no bed clothes of any kind, not the least appearance of food or fire. She had, indeed, a place in one corner of her cell, where a fire had at some time been kindled, but it did not appear there had been one for some months. To con firm this, a gentleman says he passed her cell five or six days after the great fall of snow in the beginning of March, that she had no fire then, and had not been out of her cave since the snow had fallen. How she subsists during the severe season, is yet a myslery ; she says she eats but little flesh of any kind ; in the summer she lives on berries, nuts, and roots. We conversed with her for some time, found her to be of a sound mind, a religious turn of thought, and entirely happy in her situalion ; of this she has given repeated proofs by refusing to quit this dreary abode. She keeps a Bible with her, and says she takes much satisfaction, and spent much time in read ing it.\" SHERMAN. Sherman, originally the north part of New Fairfield, was incorpora ted as a town in 1802. It is bounded north by Kent, west by the state of New York, east by New Milford, and south by New Fairfield. It exceeds nine miles in length from north to south, and has an average breadth of only between two and three miles. \"Its surface is uneven, being characterized by elevated and lofty bills, and deep and extensive valleys. The soil is various, according to the local situation of the lands, but is generally a gravelly loam. The bills, which are not suf fered to remain for tbe growth of timber, afford grazing; and the vales (most of which are warm and fertile,) are well adapted to the cultiva tion of wheat, rye, and Indian corn, considerable quantities of which are annually raised. Iron ore, to some extent, has been discovered in this town. The central part of the town is 60 miles s. w. from Hart ford, and about 13 miles north of Danbury. The population of the town in 1810 was 949 ; in 1830 it was 947. 51"], [422, "402 STAMFORD. STAMFORD. The Indian name of Stamford was Rippoivams. It was purchased of the Indians by Capt. Nathaniel Turner, agent for New Haven, of Ponus, sagamore of Toquamshe, and of Wascussue, sagamore of iSfi* pan. A reservation of planting ground was made for tbe Indians. Turner gave for the purchase \"twelve coats, twelve hoes, twelve hatch ets, twelve knives, two kettles, and four fathom of white wampum.\" A part or the whole of this tract was purchased of New Haven by some of the inhabitants of Wethersfield, for thirty pounds sterling. The pur chasers agreed to join the New Haven colony, in their form of govern ment. Twenty men agreed to settle here by the last of November, 1641 ; but before the end of the year, there were thirty or forty fami lies established. \"The inhabitants were, however, frequently alarmed by the tbreatenings of invasion, both from the Indians and the Dutch ; and for a considerable time were at great expense in fortifying and guarding themselves ; and once, in 1653, their troubles became so great, that they were on the point of a revolt, but were quieted by the prudent measures of the colony.\" Stamford is bounded on the northwest by the state of New York, on the west by Greenwich, on the east by Darien and New Canaan, and on the south by Long Island sound. Its mean length from north to south is upwards of nine and a half miles, and its average breadth be tween three and four. This is a pleasant and fertile township, rich in the resources of agricultural opulence, abounding in the means of sub sistence, with the advantages of a ready and convenient market. The surface osthe town is undulating, exhibiting a pleasant diversity of mod erate hills and valleys. The soil is a rich gravelly loam, adapted both to tillage and grazing. The view of Stamford, (see the next page,) was taken from a rocky eminence to the southwest, which rises almost immediately from the mill stream seen in the engraving, passing to the south. The iron foundery, which is very extensive, is seen on the left. The spire seen near the cen ter of tbe print is that of the Congregational church ; that seen on the extreme right is that of the Episcopal church. Besides these churches, there are two others in the borough, one for the Baptists, the other for the Methodists. Between the Congregational and Episcopal churchse, is seen the mast of a sloop. A canal from the sea was excavated to this point in 1834. This canal is 180 rods in length, thirty feet in width, and seven in depth ; the expense of its construction, including three buildings for stores, was 7,000 dollars. There are in the limits of the borough 10 or 12 stores, 1 iron foundery, one rolling mill, one wire fac tory, and two large boot and shoe manufactories ; a bank, with a capital of 100,000 dollars, chartered in 1834. The post office in this place is a distributing office. It is 8 miles westward of Norwalk, 8 from Saw pitts, and 5 from Horseneck church in Greenwich. The number of in habitants in the borough is about seven hundred."], [423, "403 STAMFORD. Southwestern view of the Borough of Stamford. The harbor at tbe mouth of Mill river has, at ordinary tides, upwards of eight feet of water. There are two uncommonly interesting spots bordering the harbor ; that on the western side is called the South Field, a rich and beautiful farm; the other is Shipan Point. This is an elegant and fertile piece of ground. The surface slopes in every di rection, and is encircled by a collection of fine scenery. The Hon. Abraham Davenport, for a long period one of tbe Coun cillors of the colony, and afterwards of the state of Connecticut, was a resident of this town. He was the son of the Rev. John Davenport, the second minister of Stamford, and grandson of the Rev. John Dav enport, the father of New Haven colony. He was distinguished for a vigorous understanding, uncommon firmness of mind, and Christian in tegrity of character. Two instances (says Dr. Dwight) of Colonel Dav enport's firmness of mind deserve to be mentioned. \" The 19tri of May, 1780, was a remarkable dark day. Candles were lighted in ma ny houses; the birds were silent and disappeared, and the fowls retired to roost. The legislature of Connecticut was then in session at Hartford. A very general opinion prevailed, that the day of judgment was at hand. The House of Representatives, be ing unable to transact their business, adjourned. A proposal to adjourn the Council was under consideration. AVhen the opinion of Colonel Davenport was asked, he an swered, ' I am against an adjournment. The day ofjudgment is either approaching, or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for an adjournment : if it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish therefore that caudles may be brought.' \"The other instance took place at Danbury, at Ihe Court of Common Pleas, of which he was chief justice. This venerable man, alier he was struck with dealh, heard a considerable part of a trial, gave the charge to the jury, and took notice of an article in ihe testimony which had escaped the attention of the counsel on both sides. He then retired from the bench, and was soon after found dead in his bed.\" [From the Connecticut Courant, No. 1596.] Hartford, May 24lh, 1798.

The original Indian name of Stratford was Cupheag. It was pur chased by Mr. Fairchild in 1639, and settlements were commenced at the same time. Mr. Fairchild came directly from England, and was the first person vested with civil authority in the town. The first prin cipal persons in the town were John and William Eustice, and Samuel Hawley, who were from Roxbury, and Joseph Judson and Timothy Wilcoxson, who were from Concord, Massachusetts. A few years from the commencement osthe settlement, Mr. John Birdsey removed from Milford, and became a man of eminence, both in the town and church. There were also several of the chief planters from Boston, and a number by the name of Welles, from Wethersfield. \" Mr. Adam Blackman, who had been Episcopally ordained in England, and"], [425, "405 STRATFORD. a preacher of some note, first at Leicester and afterwards at Derby shire, was their minister, and one of the first planters. It is said that he was followed by a number of the faithful, into this country, to whom he was so dear that they said unto him, in the language of Ruth, ' In treat us not to leave thee, for whither thou goest we wiil go ; thy peo ple shall be our people, and thy God our God.' \" The first settlers appear to have located themselves about 150 rods south of the Episcopal church, the first chimney being erected near this spot ; it was taken down about two years since. The first burying ground was near this spot. Mr. William Judson, one of the first set tlers, came into Stratford in 1638. He lived at the southwest corner of Meeting-house hill or green, in a house constructed of stone. Mr. Ab ner Judson, his descendant, lives on the same spot, in a house which has stood 113 years, and is still in good repair. The whole township, which formerly was quite extensive, was pur chased of the natives. The purchase was however not completed till 1672. There was a reservation of good lands for the improvement of the Indians, at Pughquonnuck or Pequannock, Golden hill, and at a place called Coram, in Huntington. Stratford is now much circumscribed in limits. Its average length is about six miles from north to south, and its breadth from east to west is between two and three miles. It is bounded north by Hunting ton, west by Trumbull and Bridgeport, east by the Housatonic, dividing it from Milford, and south by Long Island sound. The central part of the town is 13 miles s. w. from New Haven. The township is mostly level and free from stone, and there is a very rich alluvial tract of meadows on the river and harbor. The principal street in the town is one mile in length, running north and south, parallel to tbe Housa tonic ; it is level, pleasant, and ornamented with shade trees. On this street, and others, in the immediate vicinity, there are about 200 dwell ing houses, and four houses for public worship, viz. 1 Congregational, 1 Episcopal, 1 Methodist, 1 Baptist, and 1 Universalist now erecting. The latitude of the place, as determined by the Rev. James H. Linsley, is 41\u00b0 11' 7\"; longitude, 73\u00b0 8' 45\". The following is a southwest view of the Episcopal church and the Academy, situated in the central part osthe village. This church was erected more than 90 years since, and is the oldest Episcopal church now standing in the state. The Academy is seen on the right of the print, in the distance. It stands on a gentle elevation of ground, called Meeting-house hill,* and is surrounded by a row of poplars. The Episcopal society in this town is the oldest in the state. Tbe follow ing account of its establishment is from Dr. Trumbull's History of Connecticut. \" During the term of about seventy years from the settlement of Connecticut, the Coneregalional had been the only mode of worship, in the colony. But the society for propagating the gospel in foreign parts, in 1704, fixed the Reverend Mr. Muirson as a missionary at Rye. Some of the people at Stratford had been educated in the * The Congregational church stood on this elevation till it was struck by lightning, and burnt down."], [426, "406 STRATFORD. Southwest view of the Episcopal Church, Stratford. church of England mode of worship and administering of the ordinances, and others were not pleased with the rigid doctrines and discipline of the New England churches, and they made an earnest application to Mr. Muirson to make a visit at Stratford, and preach and baptize among them. About the year 1706, upon their invitation, he came to Stratford, accompanied with Colonel Heathcote, a gentleman zealously engaged in promoting the Episcopal church. The ministers and people, in that and the adja cent towns, \"it seems, were alarmed at his coming, and took pains to prevent their neighbors and families from hearing him. However the novelty of the affair, and other circumstances, brought together a considerable assembly: and Mr. Muirsun baptized five and twenty persons, principally adults. This was the first step towards introducing the church worship into this colony. In April, 1707, he made another visit to Stratford. Colonel Heathcote was pleased to honor him with his company, as he had done before. He preached, at this time, at Fairfield as well as Stratford; and in both towns baptized a number of children and adult persons. Both the magis trates and ministers opposed the introduction of Episcopacy, and advised the people not to attend the preaching of the church missionaries; but the opposition only in creased the zeal of the church people. Mr. Muirson, after this, made several journeys to Connecticut, and itinerated among the people. But there was no missionary, from the society, fixed in Connecticut, until the year 1722, when Mr. Pigot was appointed missionary at Stratford. The churchmen at first, in that town, consisted of about fif teen families, among whom were a few husbandmen, but much the greatest number were tradesmen, who had been born in England, and came and settled there. Some of their neighbors joined them, so that Mr. Pigot had twenty communicants, and about a hundred and fifty hearers. In 1723, Christ Church in Stratford was founded, and the. Rev. Mr. Johnson, afterwards Dr. Johnson, was appointed lo succeed Mr. Pigot.\" \" The Rev. Dr. Johnson,\" says Dr. Dwight, \" may be considered as the father of Episcopacy in Connecticut, and perhaps, as the most distinguished clergyman of that description, who has been settled within its limits. This gentleman was born at Guilford in 1696; was educa ted at Yale College, and received the degree of A. B. in 1714. In 1716 he was chosen tutor, and continued in that office three years. In 1720, he was ordained minister of the Presbyterian church in West Haven. In 1723, he was Episcopally ordained in London ; and was afterwards settled at Stratford. In 1754, he was chosen president of King's College in the city of New York, and continued in this office ;ed and"], [427, "STRATFORD. 407 for nine years. In 1763, he resigned the presidency, and returning to Stratford, resumed the charge of his congregation. He died in 1772, at the age of seventy six. Dr. Johnson was a man of talents and learn ing, of dignified manners and high reputation. He published a He brew grammar, a compendium of logic, and another of ethics. The University of Oxford conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Di vinity. His life was written by Dr. Chandler, the Episcopal minister of Elizabethtown.\" The following is the inscription on his monument in the Episcopal burying ground, a few rods northeast of the church.

Myles Cooper. The house in which Dr. Johnson resided is still standing, about 40 rods northwest of the Episcopal church. Mr. Winslow succeeded Dr. Johnson in the ministry, then Mr. Kneeland, who was succeeded by Mr. Sayre. The Rev. Ashbel Baldwin was the next minister : he commenced his labors here in 1792, and continued rector of this church thirty nine years. Mr. Baldwin, who is still living, was born in Litch field, in 1757, and was educated at Yale College. He was ordained deacon at Middletown, August 3d, 1785, by Bishop Seabury. He, with four others, were ordained at the same time, being the first Prot estant Episcopal ordination in this country. Gen. David Wooster was a native of this town, and was born in 1711. He was a brave and good officer, an ardent patriot, and in his various public and private relations, sustained a character distinguished for integrity, benevolence, and virtue. He was mortally wounded in a skirmish with the British troops, at the time of their incursion to Dan bury, in 1777. The following notice of Gen. Wooster, is from the Connecticut Journal of May 14th, 1777. \" Major General Wooster was born in Stralford, in this slate, on the 2d of March, A. D. 1710 \u2014 11 ; was educated at Yale College, where he was graduated in the year 1738. Soon after the Spanish war broke out in 1739, he was employed, first as lieu tenant, and then as captain, of the armed vessel built by this colony for a Guarda Coasta. After this, he engaged in the military service of this country, and was a cap tain in Col. Burr's regiment, in the expedition against Louisburg, in 1745. After the reduction of that place, he was sent to France, with a part of the prisoners taken there, and from thence went to England, where he received the honor of a captaincy on the"], [428, "408 TRUMBULL. establishment, in Sir William Pepperell's regiment. During the peace which soon followed, he received his half pav, and was chiefly employed in his private aliairs. When the war with France was renewed in 1755, he was soon thought of as a gen- tleman qualified for a higher sphere of command, and served his country as colonel, and commandant of a brigade to tbe end osthe war. . , \"From the first rise of ibe present controversy with Great Britain, in 1764, though his interest asa half pay officer, might have apologized for him, ifhe had observed a perfect neutrality ; yet so fully convinced was he osthe ruinous measures of the Brit- ish court, and so jealous was he for his country's rights, that regardless of his private interests, he took an open and decisive part, and avowedly espoused the cause of Ame- rica, and persisted in that line of conduct to the day of his death. As soon as hostili- ties were commenced in' the Lexington battle, the General Assembly of this colony set about raising an army, and Col. Wooster, from his approved abilities, well known courage, and great experience, was appointed to ihe chiefcommand. The same sum- mer he was appointed a brigadier general in the continental service. Honored with these commissions, he first commanded the troops sent to guard New York, where it was expected that a part of the British army which came over in 1775 would land. In the latter part of that campaign, he, with his troops, went into Canada, and assisted much in the reduction of St. John's, Montreal, &c. and after Gen. Montgomery's death, had the chiefcommand in that province. He returned home in the summer of 1776, and not long after was appointed first major general of the mililia of this state. He had been out the whole of the last winter, at the head of a body of men raised by this slate for its own security, and was but lately returned ; when on Satur- day, the 26lh ult. he received the news that the enemy, in a large body, had landed at Compo. He immediately set off for Fairfield, leaving orders for the militia to be mustered and sent forward as fast as possible. When be arrived at Fairfield, finding Gen. Silliman had marched in pursuit osthe enemy with the troops then collected, he followed on with all expedition, and at Reading overtook Gen. Silliman, with the small body of militia with him, of which he of course took the command, and pro ceeded that same evening to the village of Bethel. Here it was determined to divide the troops, and part were sent off under Generals Arnold and Silliman, the rest remained with General Wooster, and them he led by the route of Danbury, in pursuit of the enemy, whom he overtook on the Sabbath, about 4 o'clock, near Ridgefield. Observing a part of the enemy who seemed to be detached from the main body, he determined to attack them, though the number of his men was less than two hundred ; he accordingly led them on himself with great spirit and resolution, ordering them to follow him. But being unexperienced militia, and the enemy having several field pieces, our men, after doing considerable execution, were broken and gave way. The General was rallying them to renew the attack, when he received the fatal wound. A musket ball, from the distance of 50 rods, took him obliquely in Ihe back, broke his back bone, lodged within him, and never could be found. He was removed from the field, had his wound dressed by Doct. Turner, and was then conveyed back to Danbury, where all possible care was taken of him. The surgeons were from the first sensible of the danger of the case, and informed the General of their apprehen sions, which he heard with the greatest composure. \" The danger soon became more apparent, his whole lower parts became insensible, and a mortification, it is thought, began very early. However, he lived till Friday, the 2d of May, and then with great composure and resignation, expired. It was de signed to bring his remains to New Haven, to be interred here, but this was found im possible, and therefore they were interred at Danbury.\" TRUMBULL. Trumbull, formerly North Stratford, originally belonged to Strat ford. It was incorporated as a town in 1798. It is bounded north by Monroe, east by Huntington and Stratford, south by Bridgeport, and west by Weston. Its average length is about five miles, and its breadth may average four and a half miles. The central part of the town is about five miles north from the city of Bridgeport. The township is uneven, diversified with hills and valleys, and the prevailing character of the soil is a gravelly loam, which is considerably"], [429, "409 WESTON. productive. The lands are tolerably well adapted to the culture of grass, and to grazing. The township is centrally intersected by the Pe quannock, a small stream, which discharges its waters into Bridgeport harbor. There are 4 houses of worship in the town, 2 Episcopal, 1 Congregational, and 1 Methodist. The inhabitants are generally far mers. The population in 1810 was 1,241 ; in 1830, it was 1,242. In the north part of Trumbull, there is an elevated bill, called Tam tashua Hill: it is the first land seen from the ocean when on this part of the coast. [From the Connecticut Journal, No. bil.] North Stratford, Aug. 28<A, 1777. On the 25th instant died in this place, Mrs. Hannah Henman, aged 99 years. She was a person of good understanding, strict religion, solid piety, and maintained a firm and unshaken hope in the merits of Christ to the end. And what is remarkable concerning her exit out of the world, she died the very day on which she was 99 years of age, of which she had a premonition near 20 years before her death, in a dream or vision ; a venerable comely person, whom she aftei wards used to call her guardian an gel, and whom she had seen once before, appeared to her, and asked her age; she told him : upon which he replied, you will not live to an hundred years, but almost; you will live to be 99, and then die. She often mentioned this to her friends and neigh bors, and was so confidently persuaded of the truth of it, that she would frequently count upon it how many years she had to live. And there are scores of persons now living in the parish, who have often heard her say, that she should die at 99, on her birth day, old style. About a fortnight before her decease, she enquired of her son, landlord John Henman, at whose house she died, the day of the month ; and again repeated to the family lhat she had just so many days to live, which accordingly hap pened on her very birth day, as it is called. The great age this person arrived to, to gether with those circumstances respecting the time of her death, are so very extraor dinary, that it was thought proper to communicate them to the public. WESTON. Weston, originally the parishes of Norfield and North Fairfield in tbe town of Fairfield, was incorporated as a town in 1787. The town appears to have been first settled in 1738. It is bounded n. by Read ing, e. by Trumbull and Monroe, s. by Fairfield and Westport, and w. by Wilton. It averages upwards of 8 miles in length from east to west, and 5 in breadth. The surface of the township is uneven and hilly, and the soil a gravelly loam. Agriculture is the principal busi ness of the inhabitants. The following is a southwestern view of the Congregational church, (erected in 1835,) and the Academy, which is possessed of a fund that renders it a free school. For this the town is indebted to Mr. Samuel Staples, who also gave a number of acres of land in the vicinity for the benefit of the school. This place is the eastern part of Weston, nine miles from Bridgeport. There are 5 houses of worship in the town, 2 Congregational, 1 Baptist, 1 Episcopal, and 1 Methodist. The first Methodist church built in New England was erected in this town. The first Methodist society in New England was formed by the Rev. Jesse Lee, Sept. 26tb, 1789, it is believed at Bridgeport. The church men tioned above, was known by the name of \" Lee's Chapel.\" 52"], [430, "410 WESTPORT. Congregational Church and the Academy, Weston. From the Connecticut Journal, December 24th, 1807.

At the same time several pieces of stonv substance fell to the earth in Fairfield county. One mass was driven against a rock and dashed in small pieces, a peck of which remained on the spot. About three miles distant, in the town of Weston, another large piece fell upon the earth, of which a mass of about thirty pounds weight remains entire, and was exhibited the same day at town meeting. A small mass has been sent to Yale College, and examined by a number of It was immediately perceived by Professor Silliman to con tain a metaf, and on presenting it to a magnet a powerful attraction proved it to be iron This is, we believe, the first instance in the United States, in which the sub stance of this species of meteor has been found on the earth, though it has often been found in Europe. Fortunately the facts respecting this wonderful phenomenon, are capable of being ascertained and verified by precision, and an investigation will, we understand, be commenced for the purpose. We request gentlemen who may have observed it in distant parts of the State, lo favor the public with their observations. It is desirable to ascertain the course or direction of the meteor ; the point of compass in which it appeared in different places; the general appearance and velocity; the man ner of its explosion, and the lime between the explosion and the report. WESTPORT Westport was incorporated as a town in 1835. It was formed from the towns of Fairfield, Norwalk and Weston. Saugatuck river passes through this town from north to south, dividing it into two nearly equal parts. The soil is generally of an excellent quality. The township is bounded n. by Weston and Wilton, e. by Fairfield, s. by the waters of Long Island sound, and w. by Norwalk. It is about five miles in length from north to south, and averages about three and a half miles in width. The population at this time is estimated to be 1,800."], [431, "WESTPORT. 411 View in Westport, (central part.) The above shows the appearance osthe central part of Westport, as it is seen 10 or 12 rods east From the bridge over the Saugatuck river. The village is built on both sides of the river, and was formerly called The Saugatuck. It is connected by the bridge seen in the engraving, which is about 40 rods in length, and between two and three miles from the sea. The building seen in the distance with a tower, on a rocky emi nence, is the Episcopal church, recently erected. The Congregational church is on the elevated ground on the eastern side osthe Saugatuck ; the two churches are about half a mile apart. There is a Methodist church about two miles above the bridge. These three are all the churches which are in the town. There are in Westport two carriage and two or three cotton factories. Shoes, hats, and other articles, are manufactured to some extent. There are 10 or 12 mercantile stores in the place. Saugatuck river is navigable for sloops and schooners as far as the village. At common tides there are about 7 feet of water by the bridge. This place is 6J miles west from Fairfield, 3J from Norwalk, 21 from Danbury, and 27 J from New Haven. In 1786, there were but five houses on both sides osthe river, in the limits of tbe present village, of which only two now remain. In con sequence of having the surplus money distributed properly, a committee was recently appointed to ascertain how many persons were in the limits of what is now Westport, when the census of 1830 was taken. It was found that 814 were in Fairfield, 725 from Norwalk, and 167 from Weston, making in the whole 1,706 persons. , _, ._ , , About two and a half miles south of the village of Westport, is a smooth and beautiful elevation, called Compo. It was at this place that the British troops landed in April, 1777, when on their expedition to Danbury. They also returned to this place when they embarked on board of their shipping. Seven or eight men were killed in the vicin ity of the Congregational church in Westport. \" When the British"], [432, "412 WILTON. reached Compo,\" says Dr. Dwight, \" they were hard pressed by the Americans ; and probably would not have escaped from complete de struction, but by the following expedient, said to have been proposed by Sir William Erskine. They landed a body of marines, and moving them into the van of their army, charged the Americans with so much vigor, that they were driven from the ground. The British then em barked in their boats, with the utmost expedition, and reached their ships in safety, but so fatigued with their march, that many of the sol diers fell, it was said, upon the decks osthe vessels, and there lay for a considerable time immovable and torpid. Tbe Americans, also, were most of them exceedingly weary. The marines being fresh, took the place of their exhausted countrymen, and were an overmatch for the fatigued Americans.\" Ball Mountain, a conical eminence, covered with large trees from its base to its summit, is situated a little south of the village, and is a striking feature in the landscape. WILTON. Wilton was incorporated as a town in 1802. It was previously a society in the town of Norwalk, organized as such in 1726. The town is about 61 miles in length, and 4 in breadth ; bounded n. by Ridge field, e. by Reading and Weston, s. by Norwalk, and w. by New Ca naan and Salem in the state of New York. , The surface of tbe town ship is broken, there being two ridges running northerly and southerly through the town. The soil is a gravelly loam, considerably produc tive, and best adapted to a grain culture. The lands are also well adapted for fruits of various kinds. Agriculture is the principal business osthe inhabitants. There is a satinet factory in the town. There are four churches, 1 Episcopal, 1 Congregational, and 2 Methodist. The central part osthe town is seven miles north of Norwalk Wilton Academy is a classical school of high repute. The students are generally from the different states of the Union. It was instituted about the year 1818, by Hawley Olmstead, Esq., and is still under his direction. The number of students is limited at about forty. \u2014 Profes sor Stuart, of the Andover Theological Seminary, is a native of this town. A silver mine has been discovered in this town. It was worked by some Englishmen during the Revolutionary war. After having work ed in the mine for some time, they suddenly absconded, and took off their treasure with them. Since this period the mine has been neg lected. S"], [433, "413 BROOKLYN. WINDHAM COUNTY. Windham County is bounded n. by Worcester County in Massa chusetts, e. by the state of Rhode Island, s. by New London County, and w. by Tolland County. It averages about 26 miles in length from north to south, and is about 19 miles in width. This county is uniformly hilly, yet no part of it is mountainous or very elevated. The prevailing soil is a primitive gravelly loam. The greatest portion of the county is stony and considerably rough, and the lands generally best adapted for grazing, and many sections afford some of the richest dairy farms in the State. The Quinnebaug and Shetucket, with their branch es, intersect this county, and afford many valuable water privileges for mills and manufacturing purposes. The valley of the Quinnebaug riv er comprises the best land in the county. The inhabitants of this county are more extensively engaged in the manufacturing business than in any other county in the State. Cotton and woolen goods are the principal articles manufactured. Windham County originally belonged to the counties of Hartford and New London. It was incorporated as a county in May, 1726. The following is a list of the several towns in the county, with their population in 1830.

BROOKLYN. The town of Brooklyn was incorporated in the year 1786, previous to which period it was included within the limits of Pomfret and Can terbury. The boundary line between these two towns, ran about half a mile south of the present village of Brooklyn, extending from the Quinnebau^ river in the east, to a small stream nearly a mile east of the village of Hampton, which was then called Kennedy or Wind ham village. \" In the year 1703, Richard Adams, Esq. then residing in that part of Norwich which now constitutes the town of Lisbon, purchased of James Fitch 3,000 acres of land, lying in the south part of Pomfret, where the village of Brooklyn now stands. This land he divided into five narrow lots, which he deeded to his five sons. The first lot was bounded south by the line between the two towns, extending in length from Quinnebaug river on the east, to land owned by Daniel Cady,"], [434, "414 BROOKLYN. about a mile west of the village. Directly north of this was situated a tract of land owned by a Mr. John Blackwell, comprising 5,750 acres, who willed it to his son John. It was afterwards sold to Governor Belcher of Massachusetts, who divided it into farms and sold them to different individuals, among whom was the well known Gen. Putman. This tract of land went by the name \" Mortlake ;\" it extended further west than the Adams purchase. A beautiful stream, which rises in the western part of this tract, received its name from the proprietor, viz. \" Blackwell's ;\" it empties into the Quinnebaug. In the year 1747, the inhabitants of Mortlake sent a petition to the General Assembly, to be made a town. But the petition was slighted, and it was then resolved that it should be afterwards called Pomfret. In the north part of Canter bury, (that part of it which is now included within the limits of Brook lyn,) the land was owned by Edward Spalding ; on the west of the Adams and north of the Spalding purchase, the land was owned by Daniel Cady. All of these tracts together were called the \" Two Ad ditions.\" There was, at that period, no particular village. In the year 1724, Daniel Cady deeded to the Two Additions 1 acre of land for a burying ground ; it lies nearly half a mile south of the village of Brook lyn. \"In the year 1731, the first society meeting was holden, and in the succeeding year the first Ecclesiastical society was formed, having the same limits with the present town of Brooklyn. From 1732 till 1754, this society went by the title of Mortlake ; it was then changed to Brooklyn, and was called Brooklyn society until 1786, when it was made a town. The first church was built in 1734, about 10 rods north west of the site of the present one ; the second was built in 1771. The first minister was ordained in 1735, whose name was Rev. Epbriam Avery. He died in 1754, and was succeeded by the memorable Dr. Whitney, who continued his ministerial duties until 1824, during a period of 68 years. The society divided in 1817; and in 1820 a chapel was built by the Congregationalists : the Unitarians held the old church. The court house was removed from Windham to Brooklyn in 1820. The principal streams in Brooklyn are the Quinnebaug river and Blackwell's brook. The hills are the Gray Mare, which is situa ted about one fourth of mile north west of Brooklyn ; (it derives its name from the circumstance of an old mare and colt having been caught among the ledges, and confined there until the colt had eaten off the old mare's mane ;) and Tetnuck hill, which is situated in the south part of the town. On the southeast side of this hill, there is quite a celebrated cave, called Lyon's Den; it derives its name from this circumstance, viz. during the Revolutionary war, a man by the name of Lyon deserted his post, and concealed himself in this cave until the pursuit was over. There is a mineral spring in the northeast part of the town, which is often resorted to in the summer season for medical purposes.\" Brooklyn is bounded n. by Pomfret, e. by the Quinnebaug, separa ting it from Kilhngly and Plainfield, s. by Canterbury, and w. by Hampton. The town is nearly six miles in length from north to south,"], [435, "415 BROOKLYN. and five in breadth. It is uneven, consisting of hills and valleys, and somewhat stony ; but it is fertile, and admirably adapted to grazing. The dairy business, and the raising of sheep and swine, are the leading agricultural interests of the town. There is a cotton factory in the town, on the Quinnebaug, near the village of Danielsonville in Killingly. North view of Brooklyn, (central part.) The above is a northern view of the central part of the village of Brooklyn. The village consists of about 40 or 50 dwelling houses, 3 houses for public worship, a court house, and 4 or 5 mercantile stores ; it is about 20 miles from Norwich, 40 from Hartford, and 30 from Providence. The building which is seen on the right is the court house. The Unitarian church is seen in the central part of the en graving. The Congregational church, recently erected, is seen farther to the south. The Baptist church is the small building with a steeple, seen a little west of the Unitarian church. The Brooklyn bank is the building seen on the extreme left, under the trees. A few paces north of this, and opposite the Unitarian church, was the residence of Gen. Putnam : the house in which he lived has been taken down within three or four years past. The field in which he was plowing when he first heard of the Lexington battle, is in full view, about 100 rods dis tant. He left his plow in the middle of the field, unyoked his team, and without waiting to change his clothes, mounted his horse and set out for the theater of war. His first place of residence in these parts, was about two miles north, where he had a farm ; at the time of his noted wolf exploit, his house here was very near the boundary line be tween Brooklyn and Pomfret. Gen. Putnam, in the decline of life, publicly professed the religion of the gospel, and in the opinion of the respectable clergyman of Brooklyn, the Rev. Dr. Whitney, died hope fully a Christian. \" During the gayest and most thoughtless period of bis life,\" says Dr. Dwight, \" he regarded religion with profound reve rence, and read the scriptures with the deepest attention.\""], [436, "416 BROOKLYN. The Episcopal church in this town is situated about lj miles east of the court house. This was the first church erected, and for a long pe riod the only church for that denomination in this county. It was erected before the Revolutionary war, by Mr. Godfrey Malbone, a gen tleman from Rhode Island, who had been educated at Oxford, Eng land. He married a lady from the south, who for part of her patrimony brought 50 or 60 slaves on to the large estate on which he resided in this town. The state of Connecticut, after tbe Revolution, having abolished slavery within her borders, Mr. Malbone's servants became dispersed, and a great proportion of the colored people in this part of the state are their descendants. Gen. Putnam's Monument. The above is a representation of the monument in the grave yard south osthe village of Brooklyn. The following is the inscription on the marble slab forming the top : \u2014 \" This Monument is erected to the memory osthe Honorable Israel Putnam, Esq., Major General in the Armies of the United States of America ; who was born at Sa lem, in the Province of Massachusetts, on the 7th day of January, 1718 ; and died at Brooklyn, in the state of Connecticut, on the 29th day of May, A. D. 1790. Passen ger, if thou art a Soldier, go not away till thou hast dropped a tear over the dust of a Hero, who, ever tenderly attentive to the lives and happiness ofhismen, dared to lead where any one dared to follow.

If ihou art an honest, generous and worthy man, ren der a sincere and cheerful tribute of respect to a man whose generosity was singular ; whose honesty was proverbial; and who, with a slender education, with small advan tages, and without powerful friends, raised himself to universal esteem, and to offices of eminent distinction, by personal worth, and by the diligent services of a useful life.\" The following sketch of the life of General Putnam, is from Allen's American Biographical Dictionary : \u2014 \" Israel Putnam, a major general in the army of the United States, was born at Sa lem, Massachusetts, January 7, 1718. His mind was vigorous, but it was never culti vated by education. When he for the first time went to Boston, he was insulted for his rusticity by a boy of twice his size. After bearing his sarcasms until his good na ture was exhausted, he attacked and vanquished the unmannerly fellow, to the great diversion of a crowd of spectators. In running, leaping and wrestling, he almost al ways bore away the prize. In 1739 he removed to Pomfret in Connecticut, where he cul tivated a considerable tract ofland. * * * During the French war, he was appointed to command a company of the first troops which were raised in Connecticut, in 1755 He rendered much service to the army in the neighborhood of Crown Point. In 1756 while near Ticonderoga, he was repeatedly in the most imminent danger. He esca ped in an adventure of one night, with twelve bullet holes in his blanket. In August he was sent out with several hundred men to watch the motions osthe enemy Bein\u00b0-' ambuscaded by a party of equal numbers, a general but irregular action took place!"], [437, "ASHFORD. 417 Putnam had discharged his fusee several times, but at length it missed fire while its muzzle was presented to the breast of a savage. The warrior with his listed hatchet and a tremendous war whoop, compelled him to surrender, and then bound him to a tree. In ihe course osthe aclion the parties changed their position, so as to bring this tree directly between them. The balls flew by him incessantly: many struck the tree, and some passed through his clothes. The enemy now gained possession of the ground, but being afterwards driven from the field, they carried their prisoner with them. At night he was stripped, and a fire was kindled to roast him alive; but a French officer saved him. The next day he arrived at Ticonderoga, and thence he was carried to Montreal. About the year 1759 he was exchanged through the ingenu ity of his fellow prisoner, Colonel Schuyler. When peace took place he returned to his farm. He was plowing in his field in 1775, when he heard the news of ihe battle of Lexington. He immediately unyoked his team, left his plow on the spot, and without changing his clothes set off for Cambridge. He soon went back to Connecti cut, levied a regiment, and repaired again to tbe camp. In a little time he was pro moted to the rank of major general. In the battle of Bunker's hill he exhibited his usual intrepidity. He directed the men to reserve their fire, till the enemy was very near, reminded them oflheir skill, and loldthem to take good aim. They did so, and the execution was lerrible. After the retreat hemadeasland at Winter hill, and drove back the enemy under cover of their ships. When the army was organized by General Washington at Cambridge, Putnam was appointed to command the reserve. In August, 1776, he was stationed al Brooklyn, on Long Island. After the defeat of our army on the 27th of that month, he went to New York, and was very serviceable in the city and neighborhood. In October or November, he was sent to Philadelphia, to fortify that city. In January, 1777, he was directed to take post at Princeton, where he continued until spring. At this place a sick prisoner, a captain, requested that a friend in the British army at Brunswick might be sent for to assist him in making his will. Putnam was perplexed. He had but fifty men under his command, and he did not wish to have his weakness known; yet he was unwilling to deny the request. He however sent a flag of truce, and directed the officer to be brought in the night. In the evening, lights were placed in all the college windows, and in every apartment osthe vacant houses throughout the town. The officer on his return reported that Gen. Put nam's army could not consist of less than four or five thousand men. In the spring, he was appointed to the command of a separate army in ihe highlands of New York. One Palmer, a lieutenant in the tory new levies, was detected in the camp: Governor Try on reclaimed him as a British officer, threatening vengeance if he was not restored. Gen. Putnam wrote the following pithy reply : ' Sir, Nathan Palmer, a lieutenant in your king's service, was taken in my camp as a spy; he was tried as a spy; he was condemned as a spy ; and he shall be hanged as a spy. P. S. Afternoon. He is hang ed.' At the loss of Fort Montgomery, the commander in chief determined to build another fortification, and he directed Putnam to fix upon the spot. To him belongs the praise of having chosen West Point. The campaign of 1779, which was prin cipally spent in strengthening the works at this place, finished the military career of Putnam. A paralytic affection impaired the activity of his body, and he passed the remainder of his days in retirement, retaining his relish for enjoyment, his love of pleasantry, his strength of memory, and all the faculties of his mind.\" ASHFORD. '\u2022'The settlement of the lands granted by the royal charter, was an object constantly kept in view by the legislature, and which they were anxiously engaged to effect. They selected convenient tracts of lands, and laid them out in townships, and gave all proper encouragements to adventurers who were willing to encounter the hardships and dangers of new settlements. As there was a good tract of land lying west of Pom fret, and north of Mansfield, adjoining Crystal Pond, they in 1706, granted a township, six (?) miles square, by the name of Ashford. The settlement of the town, however, did not commence till 1710, when two families moved on to the lands. In about four years, the inhabitants were so increased, that upon their petition, in 1714, the Assembly vest- 53"], [438, "418 ASHFORD. ed them with the privileges of a distinct town. Their first minister was the Rev. James Hale, ordained Nov. 26th, 1718.\" Ashsord is bounded n. by Union and Woodstock, e. by Pomfret, w. by Willington, and s. by Hampton, Chaplin and Mansfield. The south part of the town is about 9 miles long, and the west part about 8 in width. The surface of the land is hilly and stony, the soil being hard and gravelly, yet considerably fertile, and well adapted to grazing. There are three societies in the town, Ashsord, Westsord and Eastford ; 8 houses for public worship, 3 for Congregationalists, 4 for Baptists, and 1 for Methodists. Agriculture is the principal business of the inhabit ants. There are 3 woolen factories and 1 cotton factory in the town. Southwestern view of Ashsord, (central part.) The above is a southwestern view of the Congregational church, Academy, and the two public houses, in the central part of Ashsord. This place is 31 miles from Hartford, 39 from Providence, and 65 from Boston. The ancient Congregational church stood nearly on the spot where the church seen in the engraving is situated. The following tradition has been handed down from father to son in Ashsord : it is said to have taken place on this spot, and is illustrative of the manners and customs of ancient times : \u2014 \" A concourse of people were assembled on the hill in front of the meeting house, to witness the punishment of a man who had been con victed of neglecting to go to meeting on the Sabbath for a period of three months. According to the existing law for such delinquency, the culprit was to be publicly whipped at the post. Just as the whip was about to be applied, a stranger on horseback appeared, rode up to the crowd of spectators, and enquired for what purpose they were assem bled. Being informed of tbe state of the case, the strange gentleman rose upright in his stirrups, and with emphasis addressed the astonished multitude as follows : \" You men of Ashsord, serve God as if the D...1"], [439, "419 ASHFORD. was in you ! Do you think you can whip the grace of God into men? Christ will have none but volunteers.\" The people stared, while the speaker, probably not caring to be arraigned for contempt of court, put spurs to his horse, and was soon out of sight; nor was he ever more seen or heard of by the good people of Ashsord.\" The following, which is descriptive of the scenery, &tc, of Ashsord, is furnished by a native of the place : \u2014 \" The traveler, on arriving at Ashsord, is greeted by no imposing spectacle. From the dislant hill, as he approaches, he sees no ancient towers, nor, as he enters the cen ter of the old town, does he meet wilh walled environs and a grated entry. Even in Spartan days, or in feudal times, the virtue and the hospitality which characterize such inhabitants, would have dispensed with walls and bulwarks. The simple view of a meeting house, an academy, two taverns, a cluster of neat dwellings, and surround ing scenery not particularly attractive, leaves no enduring impression upon the mind of the indifferent sojourner, who, after a night's repose, or a well prepared meal, ten ders a sincere farewell to his obliging host, and resumes his seat in the post coach. But he who would enjoy the native attractions of the place, must be at leisure, and not wholly disinterested. Some strong tie, like that of consanguinity, should be thrown around him. In fine, he must be a good pedestrian. If he have these prerequisites, he may leave the turnpike and traverse a northern section of the township, where he shall find a region worthy to have been the nursery osthe eagle spirit of a Knowlton. He shall stroll complacently among the pines which embower ihe rocky upland, and his eye shall dilate upon the landscape, as viewed from the topmost shelf osthe storm beaten crag. He shall lurn from this species of scenery, to another not less enchant ing. He shall leave the mountain for the plain, and make his way through the thickly wooded valley, where also wanders the murmuring rivulet, which is destined, ere its waters reach the sea, to bear a navy upon its bosom. Among these solitudes, he may perchance identify the ' banks and braes' among which, while a stripling, he angled for dace and trout. And here, where the shade of the overspreading beech falls upon the stream, isa corresponding shade of melancholy fall upon his heart, as memory re curs to his early friends and associates, that shade shall be but momentary. For when he shall arrive at the skirt osthe wood, he may hear the careless whistle osthe indus trious farmer, and be cheered by the smile and merry song of his more than Roman daughters.\" Col. Thomas Knowlton, who fell in the battle near Haerlem Heights, in September, 1776, was a native of this town. He was an intrepid soldier, a true patriot, and a worthy citizen. He was among the first who rallied around the standard of independence. He distinguished himself at the battle of Bunker Hill. The day after the retreat of the Americans from Long Island, being followed by the enemy, Gen. Wash ington detached a force under Col. Knowlton to oppose them, who charged them with great intrepidity, gained considerable advantage, and raised the depressed spirits of the army. He fell mortally wounded, at the head of his men, during the heat of the action. Gen. Washington, in his orders tbe day after he fell, styled him \" the gallant and brave Colonel Knowlton, who would have been an honor to any country.\" The following inscriptions are from monuments in the yard on the north side of the church represented in the engraving : \u2014 Isaiah, lv. 3.

She lived a life of usefulness below, She lives we trust a life of glory now. CANTERBURY. Canterbury originally belonged to Windham, afterwards to Plain field. The General Assembly, in 1703, enacted that the town of Plain field should be divided, and that the inhabitants on tbe west side of the river should be a distinct town by tbe name of Canterbury. \"It seems, that the settlement of this tract commenced about the year 1690. The principal settlers from Connecticut, were Major James Fitch and Mr. Solomon Tracy, from Norwich ; Mr. Tixhall Ellsworth and Mr. Samuel Ashley, from Hartford ; but much the greatest number were from New town, Woburn, Dorchester, Barnstable and Medfield, in Massachusetts. Among these were John, Richard, and Joseph Woodward, William, Obadiah and Joseph Johnson, Josiah and Samuel Cleveland, Elisha Pain, Paul Davenport, and Henry Adams.\"* Canterbury is bounded n. by Brooklyn, w. by Windham, e. by Plain field, and s. by Lisbon and Plainfield. It is eight miles long, and about four and a half broad. The surface of the town is uneven, though it can scarcely be called hilly, and some sections are level. Tbe soil is a gravelly loam, and generally fertile and productive. The town is watered by the Quinnebaug, which is here a large and beautiful stream. It annually overflows its banks, and fertilizes the fine tract of alluvial soil upon its borders. These natural meadows are very fertile, and af ford the largest crops, and at the same time are cultivated with the greatest facility. The town is divided into two societies, Canterbury, and Westminster, which embraces the western section of the town. In each society there is a Congregational church: there is also a Baptist church in the north part of the town. There are three cotton factories, two of which are in Packersville, a small manufacturing village, partly in the limits of this town, and partly in the limits of Plainfield, near the eastern bank of the Quinnebaug. The principal village in Canterbury is pleasantly situated, on eleva ted ground, about half a mile west of the Quinnebaug. The engra ving shows a south view of tbe Congregational church, the green, and some of the houses in the vicinity ; from this spot the ground descends on every side except to the west. This place is 15 miles from Nor- * Dr. Trumbull."], [441, "421 CANTERBURY. wich, 6 south of Brooklyn, 33 from Providence, and 40 from Hartford. On the left of the engraving is seen the house formerly occupied as a school by Miss Prudence Crandall. for colored girls, which at the time it was kept caused considerable excitement in this vicinity. South view of the central part of Canterbury. In November, 1831, Miss Crandall, who had gained a high reputa tion as a female instructress, proposed to some of the leading individ uals in Canterbury, to open a \" boarding school\" in their village, for the education of young ladies. Her proposal was very favorably re ceived, and by the patronage of the inhabitants the school was imme diately opened, and continued rising in respectability. In September, 1832, a respectable pious colored girl, a resident in Canterbury, and a member of the Congregational church, wishing to qualify herself to become a teacher among persons of her own color, requested admission into Miss Crandall's school. Miss C. at first hesi tated, but at length, on a repetition of the request, urged with more earnestness than before, \" she was admitted as one of her pupils.\" It was however soon intimated to Miss C. that unless she removed this scholar, the school would be greatly injured. Miss Crandall, who ap pears to have been governed in this affair by what she conceived to be her religious duty, in opposition to \" public opinion,\" retained her col ored pupil. In her view it appeared unjust and oppressive to expel a worthy scholar, who was guilty of no crime, merely on account of color. According to her view, the precepts of Christianity inculcated the du ties of justice and benevolence to all, without respect to persons, and a spirit ready to make sacrifices for the good of others. After consult ing with a number of people in different places, who professed to be friends of the improvement and education of colored persons, and also considering the deep prejudices existing against an unfortunate and in jured race, the difficulties which those of them who are desirous of an"], [442, "422 CANTERBURY. education lie under, in not being admitted to the higher seminaries of learning, Miss C. determined to open a school for their benefit, and ac cordingly dismissed her white scholars, and gave public notice that on the 1st of April her school would be opened for \" young ladies and little misses of color.\" The people of Canterbury, considering that this school would have a tendency to draw a despised class of persons to their village, and possessing their share of the feelings so common against the race, en deavored to break up the school. For this purpose they appointed a number of committees to wait on Miss C. in order to dissuade her from the design. All their attempts were unsuccessful. At this period, there being no law in Connecticut to prevent the education of colored per sons coming from other states, a petition was drawn up, signed by a considerable number of petitioners, and sent to tbe Legislature, who granted the prayer of the petitioners, by passing an act prohibiting the instruction of colored persons from other states, in any schools except the common free schools and incorporated academies, without the con sent of the town in which such schools should be situated. The passage of this law, (May, 1833,) was celebrated in Canterbury by ringing the bell and firing of cannon. About six weeks after the passage of the law, a suit was commenced against Miss C. which resulted in her con finement in the county jail at Brooklyn about a day, when bonds were given for her appearance before the County Court. The case came finally before tbe Superior Court, where the constitutionality of the law which Miss C. had broken, was argued. The counsel on the part of Miss C. contended that the law was unconstitutional, for the con stitution of tbe United States declares, \" The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the sev eral states.\" The judge on this case decided that colored persons were not citizens. \" From the commencement of her school for colored girls, Miss C. was subjected to a variety of insults and injuries, which, if not approved and countenanced by the more respectable inhabitants, were at least suffered to pass with an impunity that would have hardly attended them, had any other person been the injured party.\" Miss Crandall continued her school till after the decision above referred to, when she became united in marriage with a Baptist clergyman, and soon after the school was discontinued. Jonathan Carver, a celebrated traveler, was (it is believed) a native of this town. The following is from Allen's American Biographical Dictionary. Jonathan Carver, an enterprising traveler, was a native of Connecticut, and was born in 1732. He lost his father, who was a justice of the peace, when he was only five years of age He was iniended for ihe profession of medicine, which he quitted for a military life In the French war he commanded an independent com pany ol provincials, m the expedition carried on across the lakes against Canada He served with reputation till the peace of 1763. After this he formed the resolution of exploring the most interior parts of North America, and of even penetrating to the Pacific Ocean, over that broad part of the continent, which lies between the forty third and the forty sixth degrees of north latitude. As the English had come in pos-"], [443, "423 CANTERBURY. session of a vast territory by the conquest of Canada, he wished to render this acqui sition profitable to his country, while he gratified his taste for adventures. He be lieved, that the French had intentionally kept other nations ignorant of the interior parts ofNorth America. He hoped to facilitate the discovery of a northwest passage, or of a communication between Hudson's bay and the Pacific Ocean. If he could effect the establishment of a post on the Straits of Annian, he supposed he should thus open a channel for conveying intelligence to China and the English settlements in the East Indies with greater expedition, than by a tedious voyage by the cape of Good Hope, or the straits of Magellan. \" With these views he set out from Boston, in 1766, and in September of that year arrived at Michillimakinac, the most interior English post. He applied to the go vernor, Mr. Rogers, to furnish him with a proper assortment of goods, as a present for the Indians living in the tract, which he intended to pursue. Receiving a supply in part, it was promised that the remainder should be sent to him, when he reached the falls of St. Anthony in the river Mississippi. In consequence of the failure of the goods, he found it necessary to return to la Prairie la Chien in the spring of 1767. Being thus retarded in his progress westward, he determined to direct his course north ward, that by finding a communication between the Mississippi and Lake Superior, he might meet the traders at the grand portage at the northwest side osthe lake. Of. them he intended to purchase the goods, which he needed, and then to pursue his journey by the way osthe lakes La Pluye, Dubois, and Ouinipique to the heads osthe river west. He reached lake Superior before the traders had returned to Michilli makinac, but they could not furnish him with goods. Thus disappointed a second time, he continued some months on the north and east borders of Lake Superior, ex ploring the bays and rivers, which empty themselves into the large body of water, and carefully observing the natural productions osthe country, and the customs and man ners of the inhabitants. He arrived at Boston in October, 1768, having been absent on this expedition two years and five months, and during that lime traveled near seven thousand miles. \" As soon as he had properly digested his journal and charts, he went to England to publish them. On his arrival, he presented a petition to his majesty in council for a reimbursement of the sums, which he had expended in the service of government. This was referred to the lords commissioners of trade and plantations, by whom he was examined in regard to his discoveries. Having obtained permission to publish his papers, he disposed of them to a bookseller. When they were almost ready for press, an order was issued from the council board, requiring him to deliver into the plantation oificeall his charts and journals, with every paper relating to the discoveries, which he had made. In order to obey this command he was obliged to purchase them from the bookseller. It was not until ten years after, that he published an account of his travels. Being disappointed in his hopes of preferment, he became clerk osthe lottery. As he sold his name to a historical compilation, which was published in 1779, in folio, entitled the \" New Universal Traveler,\" containing an account of all the empires, kingdoms, and states in the known world, he was abandoned by those, whose duty it was to support him, and he died in want of common necessaries of life in 1780, aged forty eight years. \" Captain Carver published a tract on the culture of tobacco ; and travels through the interior parts of North America in the years 1766, 1767, and 1768, London, 8vo. 1778.

It is bounded n. by Ashsord, e. by Hampton and Wind ham, s. by Windham and Mansfield, and w. by Mansfield. The prin cipal part of the township, however, was included in the limits of Mansfield, being a parish in that town, by the name of Chaplin. This parish was formed in October, 1809, and received its name from Dea con Benjamin Chaplin, who left a donation for the benefit of the so ciety. The township is five miles and a half in length from north to south, and averages about three and a half in width, containing about nineteen square miles. The town is intersected by the Nacbaug, which passes through it from the northeast to the southwest. The inhabitants are principally farmers. There is but one house of worship in the town, which is for Congregationalists. A paper mill, on the Nachaug, has been recently erected, near the center of the town. The central part of the town is about ten miles west from Brooklyn. HAMPTON. Hampton was incorporated as a town in 1786. It was mostly form ed from the second society of Windham, which was formed as a society in 1720, and was called Kennedy or Windham village. The place appears to have been so named from a Mr. Kennedy, who with his family were the first settlers in the society. They located themselves about two miles south of the Congregational church. It is believed that the first settlers came into this town about the year 1708. John Clark, the fourth settler, located himself nearly two miles northwest from the center; Nathaniel Flint, one mile and a half to the southeast ; William and John Durkee, and George Martin, near the center ; Na thaniel Kingsbury located himself about three miles to the northwest. Daniel Denison, two miles north; James Utley, two miles and a half, and Ebenezer Griffin, one mile and a half to the northeast. Benjamin Bedlock, John Preston and John Holt, were also among the first set tlers. The first meeting house lasted till 1754, when it was removed and a new one erected, which is the church now standing. \" The Congregational church in Hampton was organized June 5th 1723, consisting of 17 members, the descendants of many of which are yet inhabitants of the town. Upon the same day, Rev. William Bil-"], [445, "425 HAMPTON. lings was ordained their pastor. He died May 22d, 1733, aged 36 years. His successor, Rev. Samuel Mosely, was ordained May 15th, 1734, and died July 26, 1791, in the 83d year of his age, and 57th of his ministry. Rev. Ludovicus Weld, the next pastor, was ordained Oct. 27th, 1792, and at his request, in consequence of ill health, was dismissed March 2d, 1824.\" The present pastor, Rev. Daniel G. Sprague, from whom the above statement was obtained, was installed May 26th, 1824. Hampton is bounded n. by Ashsord and Pomfret, e. by Pomfret, Brooklyn and Canterbury, s. by Canterbury and Windham, and w. by Windham and Chaplin. Its length from north to south is about six miles, its breadth, upwards of three, containing about 21 J square miles. The surface of the town is uneven, being considerably hilly. The soil is a gravelly loam, considerably strong and fertile, and is well adapted for grazing. Agriculture is the principal business of tbe in habitants. There is, in the south part of the town, 1 woolen and 1 cotton factory, and in the center there is an establishment for the manu facture of spectacles, carried on by Mr. Joseph S. Curtiss, who manu factures at present between 2,000 and 3,000 pairs yearly. The principal and central village in the town is situated on the sum mit of a considerably elevated hill, 35 miles from Hartford and 6 from Brooklyn. It consists of upwards of thirty dwelling houses, 5 stores, a town house, and a Congregational church, on a single street, of perhaps about half a mile in extent. There are two other houses of worship in the town, one for Baptists, in the northeast part, and one (a small building, for Christ-ians) in the western part. There are two post offices in the limits of the town, one at the center and the other at Howard's valley. The first mail opened in Hampton was on Jan. 31st, 1820. About twenty years since, a sect of reformers, calling themselves Christ-ians, caused considerable excitement in this and some of the adjoining towns. They had a house of worship in this town, called the Goshen meeting house, (from a neighborhood by that name,) about two miles westerly from the center of the town. They ap pear to have been rather extravagant in their manner of conducting their meetings : it is stated that they were so noisy as to be heard at the distance of two miles. It is also stated, that in order to humble themselves, and become literally like little children, they have been known to crawl or creep on the floor, roll over one another, &c. In some instances they would so far neglect their worldly business as to leave their cows unmilked, he. A Mr. Smith and Mr. Varnum,* ap- * A correspondent from Hampton states, that the first Christ-ians came to Hampton in 1816 : they were also called Smithites, from one Elias Smith, who appears to have been one of the sounders of this sect. \" Varnum pretended to have special revela tions from God, that such and such persons must give him some particular article, or a sum of money. In one instance, he went to a man who was then a justice of the peace, and told him that it was revealed to him, that he must give him his horse. The justice, thinking this rather a hard requisition, as he had already given him consider able in this way, asked if one half would not do, as the horse was a valuable one. Varnum reluctantly consented, on the ground that the revelation went for the whole ; he however promised the owner osthe horse, that he would pay him back one half its value. Varnum took the horse and went off, but never fulfilled his promise.\" Var- 54"], [446, "426 KILLINGLY. pear to have been their principal preachers, or leaders. Varnum in duced some osthe people, over whom he had great influence, to move with him to Ohio, and there establish a pure and holy church, and en joy a kind of Paradise on earth. The people, however, that went with him, were generally miserably disappointed ; Varnum turned Shaker, and advised those over whom he had influence to follow his example, which was to some extent followed. KILLINGLY. Killingly was first settled about the year 1700.* An act was passed in 1708, granting the inhabitants the privileges and immunities of a township, which then included in its limits the town of Thompson. The land was purchased of the colony, and the grant was signed by Gov. Salstonstall at New Haven, Oct. 13th, 1709. Among the early settlers, whose descendants inhabit the same spot, were Messrs. Joseph Cady, James Danielson, Sampson Howe, and Ephraim Warren. The first white person buried here, was a female of Mr. Cady's family, great grandmother to Mr. Nell Alexander, an aged man still living. The precise year of her death is forgotten. Her grave is still to be seen ; but as it always happens, in early settlements, the graves of that period were left without any inscription. The old est date to be found is 1720, and marks tbe time of burial of an indi vidual of the same family. The first settlers were all athletic men, and inured to hardships; yet they made but little improvement, on account osthe roughness of the soil and the depredations osthe Indians. The aborigines of this part of the country, were a branch of the Nipmuck tribe, who were acknowledged to be less fierce and warlike than the Pequots: but though ihe lives of the settlers were not often endangered, yet they suffered great an noyance from their savage neighbors, who, being deprived of most of their game by the progress of the settlement, thought themselves justified in requiring the balance in the form of provisions, which the whites dared not refuse, notwithstanding the daily calls of their red friends. These sons of the forest sometimes traveled in companies of fifty or sixty, we are credibly informed, and took up their quarters at one house! They seldom showed violence lo the inmates to obtain admission, yet they often em ployed artifice with wonderful success. For after they had been kept over night, eight or nine more would be found the next morning, whom they had contrived to conceal with their Pappooses, thus making their number apparently smaller than it really was, in order to gain admission more readily. While the whites and Indians in this manner had constant communicalion, and were on friendly terms with each other, they used to engage in favorite sports, by which they tested their comparative strength and agility. In this respect the whites were in no degree inferior to the red men. The savage is capable of enduring great hardships, but his strength is not great in proportion to his power of endurance. Indeed in most of the contests, the well clad and civilized European showed himself far superior to the almost naked and wild American, even in respect to bodily vigor. As an example we introduce onlv the two lollowing circumstances. Mr Cady soon after his arrival, was one day mowing brush at the foot of Mashen- !l!'.\u00c6?i f111?\u2122 sr0man ad)\u00b0in>ng wood, and expressed an earnest desire to try the skill of a white man at wrestling. Cady, without hesitating dropped num induced his followers, both male and female, old and young, to make a full con less.on of all their sins in public, without regard to any of the generally received opinions of propriety or decency. \u00b0 \"***\"* lcl-clv\u2122 a IV^l^n^i acco.unt \"s Willingly, its history, traditions, &c. the author is indebted to Asa G. Alexander, A. B. of East Killingly"], [447, "427 KILLINGLY. his sythe and grappled with his savage friend, who struggled long and hard to throw him down. But the former knowing that by a display of strength and skill he might render the Indians less prone to hostility, was determined not to be worsted in this en counter : he made a desperate effort, and finally succeeded in flinging his antagonist. But unexpectedly the head of the Indian struck upon the sharp points of the stubs of the brush just mown, which, on account of the violence of the fall, perforated the skull and killed him instantly. Subsequently to this, in 1720, Mr. Jacob Spalding, who had emigra ted in 1715 with the first settlers to the south parish, had a similar ad venture. The particulars are related by his descendants of the fourth generation as follows : \"Jacob one day purchased of an Indian a deer skin, for which he paid him a tenor bill. The latter, somewhat intoxicated, forgot soon after that he had received it, and asked for the money a second time. Jacob of course paid no attention lo such an un warrantable demand, and the Indian went away muttering revenge. The next day while shingling a barn, Jacob saw him returning with two companions. He leaped from the roof, met them, and was again asked to pay the price of the deer skin. He refused to comply, till one of the company, who appeared to be the sachem of his tribe, said he had come to see ' fair play,' and avowed it to be honorable for two Indians to contend with one white man. Jacob therefore imagined he would have a rather dif ficult task to accomplish, but plucking up courage, he exerled himself to the utmost, and on the very first encounter, laid them both upon the ground and gave them a 'sound drubbing.' The other, who was looking on, was not at all disposed to assist his brethren, and gave them no other encouragement than ' Poor dogs, poor dogs ! me hope he kill you both!!' However, Jacob after 'pounding them' a short time, suffered them to escape. But the next day he saw them coming again, and the individual who imagined himself his creditor, bearing a rifle, which he was in the act of loading. Bat in thrusting his hand into his pocket to find the ball, he drew out the identical bill which he had received two days before! Conscience-struck, he said to Jacob, who was coming to meet him, ' Me believe now, Jacob, you paid me de tenor bill!' After this confession, Jacob addressed the person who had come to see 'fair play.' ' You,' said he, ' that have come to see fair play, what do you advise us to do with him V ' Tie him to de tree and whip him,' was the reply, which was done accordingly. And here a circumstance occurred, which shows to what extent the Indians carried their principle of honor. The individual in question, after this humiliating treatment, be came so dejected that he fled from his tribe, and was never heard of afterwards.\" Many of these Indians embraced Christianity, and became partially civilized. The celebrated Sampson Occum, of the Mohegan tribe, preached among them a few times. But the continual wars they had with other tribes, made it impossible to persuade them all to conform to the precepts of the Gospel. As already intimated, the aborigines of this quarter were less fierce and warlike than the Pequots ; yet the settlers were not entirely unprotected in case of any sudden emergency, which had some influence in keeping their savage neighbors at peace. Two forts were built at the north parish, and another at Danielsonville, the ruins of which latter are still visible. On one occasion only were the whites in danger. A warlike tribe came from the country south of Killingly, with the intention of murdering the whole white popula tion. They arrived at a plain a quarter of a mile north of Alexander's Lake, and encamped beneath an old white oak tree. But the settlers being apprised of their ar rival, were busy in preparation for defense. One of them in the mean time sallied forth alone to the spot where the red men were assembled. At the same moment the sachem was seen climbing the oak to reconnoitre the country. He had scarcely time to look, when he felt the bullet of the above mentioned settler, who knowing him to be the chief, had deliberately raised his musket and given him a fatal wound. Though the individual who did this bold act was alone, yet the Indians, fearing that more lay concealed, and being without a leader, gave up the expedition. The same day troops arrived from Massachusetts, and encamped over night on the plain which the Indians had abandoned. The next day they proceeded in pursuit of the enemy, after having buried one of their number who had died of sickness,"], [448, "428 KILLINGLY. Though the Indians of this quarter did not greatly annoy the whites, yet they had frequent quarrels with other tribes. To illustrate this we will relate a remarkable event which is received from tradition. The Narragansetts residing near Stonington by the sea shore, invited the Nipmucks about Danielsonville, to \" come down\" and attend a feast of \" shell fish. 1 he invi tation was accepted, the latter partook of the fish, were highly pleased, and in return invited the former to \" come up\" and attend a feast of \" lamprey eels, winch was to De ready after the lapse of two moons. The Nipmucks returned home and immediately busied themselves in catching fish for the occasion. At the appointed time, a consid erable portion of the men belonging to the Narragansett tribe, leaving their squaws at home to cultivate tbe ground and prepare food for those of the warriors lelt behind to guard their possessions, proceeded on a journey of thirty miles through a wilderness, to share the hospitality oftheir friends in Killingly. They arrived m safety and tound the feast all prepared. Both parties seated themselves on logs. The squaws were then ordered to bring forward the fish, in the kettles in which they had been cooked. A convenient supply was then provided for each of the guests, who perceiving that they were cooked without dressing, were disgusted and refused lo partake. As it was too late to remedy the matter, there was a pause. Ashamed and vexed to think they had spent so much trouble in inviting the Narragansetts to travel a distance of thirty miles to attend a feast which they could not relish, the Nipmucks proceeded to \" hard words,\" which their guests retorted with too much spirit to be borne. The Nipmucks seized their weapons and attacked their guests, who were unarmed. Many Nipmucks fell : but of the Narragansetts all perished but two, who crossed the Cluinnebaug and fled lo their tribe, bearing the news osthe massacre, Not long after, the remaining portion of the tribe came up, armed with their bows and arrows, to avenge the slaughter of their countrymen. Their march was on the western side osthe Cluinnebaug in Brooklyn, till they arrived about half a mile below Danielsonville, where ihe Nipmucks were seen encamped on the east side in Killing ly. The latter saw them coming, and hastened to give them battle : being warmly re ceived, however, they dug a trench in the sandy soil on the bank osthe river, and re, pelled the Narragansetts, who being unable to cross, entrenched themselves in the same manner on the opposite side. Both parties being greatly exasperated, continued fighting three days. The surviving Narragansetts at the end of the third day retreat ed, and left the Nipmucks to bury their dead. The entrenchments are still visible, as well as the skeletons of the Indians who perished. Both those who were slain at the massacre, and those who fell in battle, were buried in pits, which were filled with bod ies almost to the surface of ihe ground. The space thus occupied is about a quarter of an acre. Many of their bones have been dug up and carried away by the curious. The tradition adds, that on account of the wickedness of ihis transaction, the earth around this spot was blasted by a curse, so lhat to this day not a blade of grass will grow over the bodies of those murdered Narragansetts! By such petty contests and the treachery of the whites, the Indians of this part of the country gradually disappeared. Within fifteen years an aged and pious female, named Martha, the last lineal descendant of the tribe residing here, has gone to repose in the burial place of her fathers, and no red people have been seen here since, except occa sionally in small bands for the purpose of fishing. Thus much of the Indians. We might entertain our readers with stories of witches, gob lins and hobgoblins, if we had nothing of more consequence to place before them. There are however two remarkable circumstances, prob ably connected with natural phenomena, which we will relate. The first, which we gather from the lips of aged individuals still living, is as follows : \" The autumn before the American Revolution, ihe people of this town, who had long been expecting hostilities to commence, were one day alarmed by what they took to be the continued discharge of cannon and small arms to the northeast, in the di rection of Boston. The noise continued all day and night, with scarcely any inter mission, The sounds heard, it is said, exactly resembled those of musketry and field pieces. First would be heard a loud report and then smaller ones, \" slam bang slam bang,\" to use the language of those who relate the circumstance. The impression"], [449, "429 KILLINGLY. lhat the British were coming was so strong, that most of the inhabitants mustered in a body to await orders for marching to Boston. In a few days, however, contrary to expectation, they learned that no battle had taken place, and that no discharge of can non or small arms had been made between this town and Boston. Whether ihe sounds proceeded from the explosion of meteors or not, we are unable to say; but the per sons who heard them, considered them as forerunners of the war, which actually be gan six months from that time. The second circumstance was told us by an aged and respected man, Mr. Nell Alexander, who remembers it perfectly well, as also the re markable sounds alluded to above. We give it in his own words : \" In the American Revolution, just before the surrender of Lord Cornwallis, I was returning from a visit to Providence, R. I. I had arrived in Killingly, and was with in four miles of my residence at Alexander's Lake. It was a bright and clear night, without any moon. I think it was half past ten, when I accidentally looked up and saw a most brilliant sight. A very little south of the zenith, extending east and west in the sky, lay an arch composed of mounted cannon, with their muzzles pointed to wards the south. Their color was that of the Aurora Borealis. I viewed them a long while and attempted to number them, but being in a wood, I was unable to dis cern those which lay near the horizon. I then hurried on to overtake a friend, whose attention I wished to direct to the phenomenon. My horse being fatigued, however, I did not reach him till the remarkable sight had disappeared. 1 related the event to every person I saw for a long period afterwards, but could find no one who had seen il besides myself, until I happened one day to be on a visit to my uncle, Mr. Levens, who is no longer living. In the course of conversation, without knowing that I had seen it, he related precisely the same circumstances which I have just related myself. He was in Killingly at the time, and but a few miles from ihe place where I was. He informed me that he took the trouble of counting the cannon, and as he was in a con venient situation for the purpose, he doubted not that he had unmbered them all. The whole number was 64. They were removed at a small distance from each other, well mounted and in a regular line.\" The first meeting house erected in Killingly, stood on a plain a quar ter of a mile south of the present building at the north parish. It was subsequently removed to the spot on Breakneck hill, given to the town as a burial ground by Mr. Eliezer Warren. Afterwards it occupied the ground where the town house now stands, at the \" Center,\" at which place one of its pastors was Mr. Burroughs, father of the celebrated rogue. The present building, which stands at the north parish, is placed on the highest ground in Killingly, in view of Thompson and Pomfret meeting houses; it is very neatly constructed, and was erected in 1818. It belongs to the Congregational denomination. The first pastor of the Congregational church in this town was the Rev. John Fisk. It con tained at its organization, Oct. 19th, 1715, eleven members. Besides this church, two others were subsequently organized, one at Westfield, and another at the south parish, both of the same denomination with the one already mentioned. A curious fact is related of one of the first pastors of the north parish church, who was accustomed to keep credit of the presents made him by his parishioners. In reading the credits for one week, it was found they consisted of four lines, making an harmonious couplet with perfect rhyme and measure. It is curious, as illustrating the state of things in those days, and certainly deserves to be snatched from oblivion. We give it in the form current at the present day. \" Nell Alexander ... a few little fishes David Coop - \u2022 - - a goose Sampson Howe- ... ajunkofbeef J. Dean ----- a pair of shoes!\" As connected with this denomination, one individual pastor of the north parish church deserves particular notice."], [450, "430 KILLINGLY. The Rev. Elisha Atkins, who was ordained pastor of this church in 1783, is still living, at the advanced age of 86 years. This individ ual's name deserves remembrance, inasmuch as he has spent a long life in unwearied diligence in the service of God and his country. He graduated at Yale College in 1773, and immediately entered upon his studies for the ministry. When the Revolution broke out, he entered the U. S. army, and served during the war as chaplain ; was present at the taking of Burgoyne, and witnessed various other important oc currences where the division which he joined was engaged. He com menced his ministry here, as already intimated, at the close of the American Revolution, and remained constant in his duties of pastor till within about four years osthe present time. Since then, his strength failing, he has officiated only occasionally. In spite of his advanced age, he even now possesses considerable energy both of body and mind, and a health for which he is indebted to the severe exercise taken in youth. He is universally beloved by the members of his church. The Baptist meeting house was erected in 1807, and placed under the pastoral care of Elder Cooper. The old building still stands on Chesnut hill. The new one, which is just completed, (1836,) stands about a mile south of the old one, at that part of tbe hill where it is in full view of the villages along \" Pleasant Valley.\" Killingly contains an area of 57J square miles. The surface of the country is much broken. The principal streams are the Quinnebaug or Assawoggo Quinnebaug, the Five Mile, which joins the Quinnebaug at Danielsonville, and the White-stone brook, which empties into the Five Mile. These are all excellent mill streams. The White-stone brook has its origin in Killingly pond, formerly called Mashentuck pond, a piece of water partly in Connecticut and partly in Rhode Island, which has lately been increased by building a dam at the outlet, in order to allow the water to accumulate in wet weather. In this manner it has become one of the most valuable streams possessed by any manufac turing company in the state. The other streams are the Quanduck and Kies branch, the latter issuing from a pretty piece of water, sur rounded by forests, and called the Quinnebaug pond. The most delightful portion of Killingly, in respect to scenery, is around a small sheet of water, with an outlet lo the Cluinnebaug, lying in the western part of the town, formerly knownto the Indians as Lake Mashapaug, but now called Alexander's Lake. It received its present appellation from an individual osthe name of Nell Alexander, who settled at that spot in 1720, and was himself proprietor of a great portion of the town. As this person gained his wealth in a manner which illustrates the antiquity of the propensity of the inhabitants of this state to the once honored, yet now despised employment of peddling, we will trouble you with a short notice of his history- He came from Scotland, with a great number of other emigrants, in a ship which was to land them at Boston. Just before leaving the ship he discovered a gold ring upon deck, for which he could find no owner. Thus fortunately provided, after his arrival he pawned the gold ring for small articles of trade, which he peddled in Boston and Roxbury. He was very prosperous, and finally became able to redeem the author of his success, and pursue his business without embarrassment. After a few years of constant activity, he acquired sufficient property to purchase a plantation of 3,500 acres in Killingly. The gold ring was transmitted as a sort of talisman, to his only son Nell, who transferred it to his only son Nell ; who is now living at an advanced age, and has already placed it in the hands of his grandson NeU ; and so it will doubtless"], [451, "431 KILLINGLY. continue from Nell to Nell, agreeably to the request of the first Nell, until the \" last knell of the race is tolled !\" In order to view the scenery to advantage, the observer should station himself on an eminence north of the lake in question. The eye first meels a broadly extended sur face of water, with a beautiful margin of sand and pebbles, skirted by woods of tall trees. A little further south appears a part of the lake smaller than the first, containing a beautiful little island, call ed Loon's island, frequented by all kinds of birds of passage at different seasons of the year. Eagles not unfrequently alight here in- their passage north and south. The fullest extent of the lake is one mile. Its form is very accu rately represented in the annexed sketch. Want of space will not allow us to be very minute in describing it. Its beauties seem to have struck even the rude early settlers with admiration. We have been favored with the remains of a poem, written in a moment of inspiration. It was dis covered in an old garret, and bears upon it the marks of time. We could recover only the following fragment, not remarkable for preserving very correct rhyme and measure, yet valuable as affording a specimen of the quaint style of those times. \" Betweene Five Mile and duinebaug, Which sounding through rockye Vales loud and hoarse, From every Hill and Meadow Bog Receive Supplies, and onward bende theire Course ; Enclosed around by Groves and various Trees, With Shore of Sand and Skye of Blue, With Water gently ruffled by the Breeze, Lake Mashapaug douthe meete oure View !\" ** * * * * * * * * To account for the origin of this lake, a singular tradition has been handed down to us by the aborigines. It is as follows : \" In ancient times, when the red men of this quarter had long enjoyed prosperity, that is, when they had found plenty of game in the woods, and fish in the ponds and rivers, they at length fixed a time for a general powwow, a sort of festival for eating, drinking, smoking, singing and dancing. The spot chosen for this purpose was a sandy hill, or mountain, covered with tall pines, occupying the situation where the lake now lies. The powwow lasted four days in succession, and was to continue longer had not the Great Spirit, enraged at the licentiousness which prevailed there, resolved to punish them. Accordingly, while the red peop.e in immense numbers were caper ing about upon the summit of the mountain, it suddenly \"gave way\" beneath them, and sunk to a great depth, when the water from below rushed up and covered them all except one good old squaw, who occupied one as the peaks, which now bears the name of Loon's Island. Whether the tradition is entitled to credit or not we will do it justice by affirming that in a clear day, vhen there is no wind and ihe sur face of the lake is smooth, the huge trunks and leafless branches of gigantic pines maybe occasionally seen in the deepest part of the water, some of them reaching almost to the surface, in such huge and fantastic forms as to cause the beholder to startle ! As regards the other portions osthe scenery there is nothing remark able. The hills are still covered with forests ; but the vales, through which flow the principal rivers, are lined with factory villages. The population of the town is now about 4,000. The ancient forests are fast yielding to the axe of the farmer, who supplies the villages with wood. The game in the woods, and fish in the ponds and rivers, are not as plenty as formerly, to the regret of the old inhabitants, who look upon factories and other improvements as an evil. The soil is hard, but productive under proper cultivation. The animals reared upon it are robust and healthy. The same may be said of the inhabitants. This town, however, has possessed no very distinguished man \" who have gone off the stage.\""], [452, "432 KILLINGLY. Yet it were injustice not to mention the name of one no longer living, who be<ra\u2122e celebrated in the chase.

It were useless to attempt to detail all the events which marked the career of this famous sportsman. He was the terror of the foxes and rabbits for ten miles around. Many instances l might relate to illustrate the degree of skill to which he attained, but let one suffice. It is said that on one occasion, while returning home from hunting, he met three Joxes advancing towards him \" all in a row.\" As his gun was not loaded, he seized a stone and directed it as well as he was able, in a straight line towards their heads.

While chasing ihe second, the first recovered and scampered away. Had he sprung upon them the moment he saw them fall, he might have secured the three.

The trade is carried on mostly with Providence, R. I. Besides these cotton factories, there are 3 woolen mills, 1 furnace, and 1 ' axe factory. There are but few other manufactories of much consequence. \" Pleasant Valley\" contains the first six cotton factories enumerated in the list. The villages are all in sight of each other, and make a beautiful view from the top of Chesnut hill. Dayville is a thriving little village. It is attractive for its neat ap pearance, and for a bridge composed of two finely constructed stone arches, each 25 feet broad and twelve feet high. Danielsonville is an important village at the junction of the Quinne baug and Five Mile rivers, 3 miles east of Brooklyn, 25 miles north of Norwich city, 43 miles east of Hartford, and 37 miles south of Worcester. The following view shows fae appearance of Danielsonville as it is entered from the west, upon the Brooklyn road. The four story build ing with a steeple, is the Danielsonville cotton factory, containing 1,800 spindles ; between this building and the observer, the bridge over the Quinnebaug is seen. As regards natural resources, Killingly abounds in them. Breack neck hill, a considerable eminence between the White Stone brook and Five Mile river, bears on its elevated surface numerous quarries of free stone. These quarries rise above the general surface, presenting ab-"], [453, "433 KILLINGLY.

It is obtained in slabs of almost every dimension, and is nearly perfectly even in structure, pre senting, if any, at least very slight inequalities. It is very hard, and therefore little liable to break in removing it from the quarry. It has a uniform color, approaching to white. As the slabs of this rock lie in an inclined position, they can be detached with the most perfect facil ity. There are other kinds of slate rock in Killingly, which have the appearance of granite, but are quite soft, and consequently more easily wrought for the purpose of building. The latter kind lies most abun dant about Killingly pond. There is still another kind of slate rock sit uated at the south parish. Its composition is granular quartz, and it possesses a color nearly or entirely white. It is a very valuable stone for walks, inasmuch as it is quite soft and yielding. It is obtained in slabs, but is mostly below the general surface of the ground, and is not so regular in its structure as the other kinds mentioned. When the Norwich and Worcester rail road shall have been completed, these stones will become a source of gain to the owners, who could easily transport them to New York. Under present circumstances, however, being at the distance of 22 miles from Providence, which is tbe near est seaport, the profit of traffic in this article is inconsiderable, and con sequently but few stones have been taken away. Mashentuck hill next deserves mention. It is a considerable emi nence, comprising a circuit of two or three miles, terminating in an ab rupt steep at the southern extremity of \"Pleasant Valley,\" and \"bear ing on its back\" a rich bed of porcelain clay, which has been pro nounced by competent judges to equal the best French or Chinese clay. The feldspar, too, accompanies it in a solid form, and is abundant. It was discovered while digging a well. For a few feet below the surface of the ground, the clay was mixed somewhat with vegetable matter ; 55"], [454, "434 PLAINFIELD. but at the depth of 10 feet it became perfectly white and pure. In fine, it became, in the graphic language os those who dug the well, ** like lard !\" The well was dug twenty feet farther, when the project of perforating the whole bed was abandoned. The clay was then care fully examined, and found perfectly free from grit. The sides of the well presented to the eye alternate layers of clay and feldspar. The latter substance had a brilliant appearance like ice. PLAINFIELD. \" In June, 1659, Gov. Winthrop obtained liberty of tbe Assembly, to purchase a large tract at Quinnebaug. Soon after, he made a pur chase of Allups, alias Hyemps, and Mashaushawit, the native proprie tors of the lands comprised in the townships of Plainfield and Canter bury, lying on both sides of Quinnebaug river. There was a small number of families on the lands at the time of the purchase, but the planters were few until the year 1689, when a number of people, chiefly from Massachusetts, made a purchase osthe heirs of Gov. Win throp, and began settlements in the northern part osthe tract. At their session in May, 1699, the General Assembly vested the inhabitants with town privileges. The next year it was named Plainfield.\"* Plainfield is bounded n. by Killingly, e. by Sterling, w. by Canter bury, and s. by Griswold and Voluntown. It is about 8 miles long from north to south, and about 5 wide. The eastern section of the town is rough and broken, being hilly and stony. The bills are considerably elevated and continuous, forming ridges, extending in a northerly and southerly direction. The western section is an extensive plain, the surface being level, and the soil a light sandy loam, which is cultivated with facility, being fertile and well adapted to a grain culture. When this town was first settled by the whites, these plains were free from timber, and admitted of immediate cultivation. From the great quan tities of corn raised here, this place was called the Egypt of the sur rounding settlements. There is at present considerable manufacturing business carried on in this town, principally cotton and woolen factories, the most of which are in the little manufacturing villages called Union ville and Centerville, situated on Moosup river, a fine mill stream which discharges its waters into the Quinnebaug. There are four houses of worship in the town, 2 for Baptists, 1 for Congregationalists, and 1 for Friends or Quakers. The Indians were numerous at the time the town was first settled, amounting to 400 or 500. They continued for many years with the English, living in the most friendly manner. \" The Gospel (says Dr. Trumbull) hath bad by far the most happy effect upon the Quinnebaug or Plainfield Indians, of any in Connecticut.

They were filled with the knowledge of salvation, and expressed it to admiration. They were.entirely reformed as to the manner of their living. They became temperate, and abstained from drinking to excess, which it had before been found utterly impossible to effect by any other means. They held religious meetings, and numbers of them formed into church state, and had the sacraments administered to them.\" Western view of Plainfield. The above is a representation of the Congregational church, Plain field Academy, and some of the adjacent buildings, as seen from the burying ground, about half a mile westward from the church. Plain field Academy (seen eastward from the church in the engraving) is one of the most respectable institutions osthe kind in the state. It was in corporated in 1783. The higher branches of education are taught, and there are generally 3 or 4 instructors attached to the institution. The Academy stands on a commanding eminence, from which there is a fine and extensive prospect in almost every direction. This place is 41 miles east from Hartford, 30 west from Providence, 15 from Norwich, and 8 from Brooklyn. It is said that the first settlers located them selves on the banks of a small stream, about 80 rods west osthe Con gregational church, and also on Black Hill,* situated between two and three miles to the northwest, near the Quinnebaug. A remarkable instance of healing took place in this town in 1743, in the case of Mrs. Mercy Wheeler. The account was drawn up by the Rev. Benjamin Lord, A. M., evidently with a great deal of care and * So called (it is said) from its black appearance at the first settlement osthe lown : the Indians were accustomed lo burn it over every year, in order to make good pastur age for deer."], [456, "436 PLAINFIELD. accuracy. The pamphlet contains the deposition of the physician (Dr. James Girauld) and a number of respectable people, given under oath, certifying to the fact of her immediate healing. At the time, it was considered as an evident interposition of divine providence. Mrs. Wheeler was savored with good health till her twentieth year, in 1726, when she was seized with a nervous fever, and was reduced to almost unexampled weakness of body, so that for about five years she could not turn her head on her pillow ; her speech sailed, and her sight was very much impaired. After this she recovered in some little degree, though for sixteen years she was not able to lilt up a foot to take a step. The account states, \" that her ankle bones were exceedingly loose and separate, by reason of the long and great relaxation of tbe nerves and tendons, that she could in no wise lift them up and use them, as per sons are want to do, that yet have no strength to walk without help : yea, so loose and separate were they, that a string must sometimes be used about her feet and ankles, to keep her feet in any proper position, as she lay in the bed. And also, her knee bones were so weak and loose, that after she was able to turn herself in bed. she sometimes put them out in doing this.\" Mrs. Wheeler being of a pious disposition of mind, a sermon, at her request, was occasionally preached at her fa ther's house. It was on one of these occasions, (May 25th, 1743,) that she experienced her great deliverance. Mr. Lord was the minis ter who preached the sermon at the time she was healed. The ac count states : \u2014 \" And no sooner was he [Mr. Lord] gone from her, but it turned in her mind \u2014 The Lecture is ended, and the service all over, and I am not healed ; what is become of my faith now? Won't ii be with me as it used to be ? Whereupon a cloud of great dark ness came over her, for a minute or two: in which lime she was led again into herself, to see what a poor unworthy creature she was, and had some such thoughls osthe wis dom and goodness of God's will, that she felt a disposition to be as God would have her be. Then those words were repeated to her \u2014 If thou will believe, thou shalt see the glory of God. By which her darkness was carried off', and under the influence of this word now, she seemed (?s she expressed it) to be wholly taken out of herself, into the hands of God, and enabled to believe lhat he could and would heal her. Immediately upon which, she felt a strange irresistible motion and shaking, which began first with her hands, and quickly spreading over her whole frame; in which time she fella kind of weight upon her; a sort of racking of her frame ; every joint, as it were working ; and as if she was with hands squeezed together in her weak places. As this trembling went off, her pains went with it, and she felt strong, especially in the seat of life, where she had been most remarkably weak; and from thence strength diffused itself all over her animal frame, into her hips, knees, ankles, &c. She felt strong and well, as if she had no disease upon her, and was under no difficulty. And as she had this sensation of new strength and freedom, she felt as if she was a raising up, and must rise; and immediately rose up and walked away among the people, wilh evident sprightliness and vigor, to the astonishment of herself and those about her. She went this time near 16 feet crying out, ' Bless the Lord Jesus, who has healed me!' But was soon damped wilh this thought, that she was onlv in a phrenzy, and not healed ; and the more so when Mr Lord (surprised at seeing her walk thus, whom he had just before left im potent and overcome too, so that she could hardly talk) did observe to her that she was in a phrenzy, and accordingly took hold of her and led her to the bed, and bid her sit down ; yea, even thrust her down. But she could not be confined there ; feeling yet strongand at liberty, she quickly rose up again, with those words in her mind, I have loved thee with everlasting love and with the high praises of God in her monlh. ' Her soul being filed with such admiration and love, as she declared was inexpressible. Now she walked several times across the room with strength and steadiness \u25a0 which even constrained the people to think and say, verily, this is the power of God ! And they wondered, and praised the same. And it was about six o'eiock in the afternoon when the thing was done, at which they all marvelled, and having united in a prayer"], [457, "437 POMFRET. and in praise, on this remarkable occasion, they were dismissed to theirseveral homes, still wondering and rejoicing at what their eyes had beheld, and their ears had heaid that day.\" The following inscriptions are from monuments in the grave yard west osthe Congregational church.

Pomfret was first settled in 1686, and incorporated as a town in 1713. \" In October, 1687, a grant of lands, commonly called the Ma shamoquet purchase, was made by the General Assembly, to Major James Fitch, Lieutenant William Ruggles, Mr. John Gore, Mr. John Pierpont, Mr. John Chandler, Mr. Benjamin Sabin, Mr. Samuel Craft, Mr. John Grosvenor, Mr. Joseph Griffin, Mr. Samuel and John Rug gles, and Mr. Nathan Wilson. The most of these planters were from Roxbury in Massachusetts. Some of them moved on to the lands be fore the grant was made. At the session in May, 1713, the inhabitants were incorporated with town privileges. The name was changed from Mashamoquet to Pomfret. Pomfret is bounded n. by Woodstock and Thompson, e. by the Quinnebaug, separating it from Killingly, s. by Brooklyn and Hamil ton, and w. by Ashsord. Its length from east to west is about seven miles, and its breadth about five. It is divided into two societies or parishes, Pomfret and Abington. The surface of the township is un even, and diversified by hills and vales. The lands, though somewhat stony, are rich and productive. The soil is deep, strong and fertile, and admirably adapted to grazing. Butter, cheese and pork are the staple productions of the town. There is an extensive cotton factory at Pomfretville, a little village on the Quinnebaug, at the northeastern corner of the town."], [458, "438 POMFRET. South view of the Friends' Meeting House, Pomfret The above is a south view of the Friends' meeting house, situated upwards of a mile south of the central part of tbe town, a little off the main, and on a cross road. It is encircled by sorest trees, within the edge of which it is situated, and has an air of seclusion from the world ; both the situation and 'form of the building are novel in their appear ance. The two doors, in a kind of porch seen in front osthe building, are the entrances into the meeting house, the men taking one, and the women the other. The house inside is partly divided by a partition, the men occupying one part of the house, and the women the other. There are four other houses of worship in the town, 2 Congregational, 1 Baptist, and 1 Episcopal. The most populous part of the township is in the vicinity of the Baptist church, which is 7 miles from Brooklyn, 40 from Hartford, 30 from Providence, 27 from Norwich, and 60 from Boston. There are 3 post offices in this town, one in the central part of the town, one in Abington, and one about 3 miles s. e. of the Con gregational church in Pomfret, in a place called Pomfret Landing. This last place is said to have derived its name from the circumstance, that in ancient times a tavern used to be kept here, at which young men from Woodstock, Providence, and other places, used to stop, or land, and in some instances remain two or three days, carousing, &tc. The following is a representation of the entrance of the celebrated \"Wolf Den,\" rendered so famous for the exploit of Gen. Putnam. It is in the society of Abington, about two miles southwest from the Congregational church. The following is from Gen. Humphreys' Life of Putnam. \"In the year 1739, he [Gen Putnam,] removed from Salem to Pomfret, an inland ferule town in Connecticut, forty miles east of Hartford : having here purchased a considerable tract ol land, he applied himself successfully to agriculture \" The first years on a new farm, are not however exempt from disasters and disap pointments, which can only be remedied by stubborn and patient industry. Our farm-"], [459, "439 POMl'RET. Putnam's Wolf Den, Pomfret. er, sufficiently occupied in building an house and barn, selling woods, making fences, sowing grain, planting orchards and taking care of his slock, had to encounter, in turn, the calamities occasioned by a drought in summer, blast in harvest, loss of cattle in winter, and the desolation of his sheep-fold by wolves. In one night he had seventy fine sheep and goats killed, besides many lambs and kids wounded. This havoc was committed by a she wolf, which with her annual whelps, had for several years infested the vicinity. The young were commonly destroyed by the vigilance of the hunters, but the old one was too sagacious to come within reach of gun shot: upon being closely pursued she would generally fly to the western woods, and return the next winter with another litter of whelps. \" This wolf at length became such an intolerable nuisance, that Mr. Putnam enter ed into a combination with five of his neighbors to hunt alternately until they could destroy her. Two by rotation, were lo be constantly in pursuit. It was known, that having lost the toes from one foot, by a steel trap, she made one track shorter than the other. By this vestige, the pursuers recognized in a light snow, the route of this pernicious animal. Having followed her to Connecticut river and found she had turned back in a direct course towards Pomfret, they immediately returned, and by ten o'clock the next morning, the blood-hounds had driven her into a den, about three miles distant from the house of Mr. Putnam. The people soon collected with dogs, guns, straw, fire, and sulphur, to attack the common enemy. With this apparatus sev eral unsuccessful efforts were made to force her from the den. The hounds came back badly wounded and refused to return. The smoke of blazing straw had no ef fect. Nor did the fumes of burnt brimstone, with which the cavern was filled, compel her to quit the retirement. Wearied with such fruitless attempts, (which had brought the time to ten o'clock at night,) Mr. Putnam tried once more to make his dog enter, but in vain; he proposed to his negro man to go down into the cavern and shoot the wolf: the negro declined Ihe hazardous service. Then it was that the master, angry at the disappointment, and declaring that he was ashamed to have a coward in his family, resolved himself to destroy the ferocious beast, lest she should escape through some unknown fissure of the rock. His neighbors strongly remonstrated against the perilous enterprise: but he, knowing that wild animals were intimidated by fire, and having provided several strips of birch bark, the only combustible material which he could obtain, lhat would afford light in this deep and darksome cave, prepared for his descent. Having accordingly divested himself of his coat and waistcoat, and having a Ions rope fastened around his legs, by which he might be pulled back, ata concerted signal, he entered head foremost wilh the blazing torch in his hand. \" The aperture of the den, on the east side of a very high ledge of rocks, is about two feet square; from thence it proceeds obliquely fifteen feet, then running horizon tally about ten more, it ascends gradually sixteen feet towards its termination. The sides of this subterraneous cavity are composed of smooth and solid rocks, which seem to have been divided from each other by some former earthquake.

It is in no place high enough for a man to raise himself upright, nor in any part more than three feet in width. .. . \" Having groped his passage to tbe horizontal part of the den, the most terrifying darkness appeared in front of the dim circle of light afforded by his torch. It was silent as the house of death. None but monsters of the desert had ever before explored this solitary mansion of horror. He cautiously proceeding onward eame to the ascent ; which he slowly mounted on his hands and knees until he discovered the glaring eye balls osthe wolf, who was sitting at the extremity osthe cavern. Started at the : sight of fire, she gnashed her teeth, and gave a sudden growl. As soon as he had made the necessary discovery, he kicked the rope as a signal for pulling him out. The people at the mouth of the den, who had listened with painful anxiety, hearing the growl of the wolf, and supposing theii friend to be in the most imminent danger, drew him forth with such celerity that his shirt was stripped over bis head and his skin severely lacerated. After he had adjusted his clothes, and loaded his gun with nine bnck-sbot, holding a torch in one hand and the musket in the other, he descended the second time. When he drew nearer than before, ihe wolf assuming a still more fierce and terrible appearance, howling, rolling her eyes, snapping her teeth, and dropping her head between her legs, was evidently in the attitude and on the point of springing at him. At this critical instant he leveled and fired at her head. Stunned by the shock, and suffocated with the smoke, he immediately found himself drawn out of the cave. But having refreshed himself, and permitted the smoke to dissipate, he went down the third time. Once more he came within sight of the wolf, who appearing very passive, he applied the torch to her nose, and perceiving her dead, he took hold of her ears, and then kicking the rope, (still tied round his legs,) the people above, with no small exultation, dragged them both out together.\" STERLING. Sterling, formerly a part of Voluntown, was incorporated as a town in 1794. The town is of an oblong shape, 8 miles in length from north to south, and has an average breadth of three. It is bounded n. by Kil lingly, e. by the Rhode Island line, s. by Voluntown, and w. by Plain field. The face of the township is generally uneven, but there are some sections of pine plains. The soil is a light gravelly and sandy loam. The land is best adapted to a grain culture. The town is watered by two branches of the Moosup river, on which are four cotton factories. There is one house of worship in Sterling, which is for the Baptist denomina tion, and is situated in the eastern part osthe town. This house is up wards of 3 miles east of Plainfield, and about 10 s. e. from Brooklyn. \" Near the center of this town, there is a cavern, called the Devil's Den, possessing very singular and curious features. It is situated with in a ledge of rocks, and has a circular area of about 100 feet in diame ter. The rock is cleft in two places, forming at each a chasm or fis sure about fifty feet in depth, through one of which there runs a small stream of water; the other communicates with a room about 12 feet square, at the interior part of which there is a fire place, and a chim ney extending through the rock above, forming an aperture of about 3 feet square. In another part osthe rock there is a natural stair-case, winding around it from the bottom to the top. In the cold season of the year, a large mass of ice is formed in the room above described, by the dashing of water down the chimney, which continues there through nearly the whole of the warm months ; the sun being almost excluded from this subterranean recess.\"* * Pease and Niles' Gazetteer."], [461, "441 THOMPSON. THOMPSON. Thompson was formerly a part of Killingly, and was settled about 1715. It was incorporated as a distinct town in 1785. It is said to have derived its name from the circumstance of a considerable part of the township being owned by a Mr. Thompson, of England. A part osthe land was held in his name till about the year 1800. \" It is diffi cult to ascertain who were the first settlers of the town. It was mostly covered by royal patents to Thompson, Saltonstall, Wolcotts, Hum phry Davy, and others. The first old parchment deed is now in the museum* in Thompson, dated April 10th, 1716, and is from Josiah Wolcott, and Mary his wife, of Salem, Mass, to John Sabin, and is for 400 or 500 acres in the center osthe town, and bounded on tbe above old royal grants.\" The eastern part of the town was formerly called Quaduc or Quanduck. Thompson forms the northeastern corner of the county and state : it is bounded n. by Massachusetts, e. by Rhode Island, s. by Killingly. and w. by Woodstock and Pomfret. The township is nearly eight miles square, and comprises an area of 59 square miles. The Quinnebaug passes through the eastern part of the town ; in its course it receives the French river. Thompson is a rich agricultural and manufacturing town, and the inhabitants are dis tinguished for their spirit of enterprise. The surface of the township exhibits an interesting variety of hills and valleys ; many of the hills are quite elevated, but no portion of it can be called mountainous. The prevailing soil is a gravelly loam, strong and dry, well adapted to the culture of Indian corn, wheat and clover, and generally excellent for grazing. There is a great supply of valuable stone for walls and buildings. There are 4 houses of worship in the town, 2 for Baptists, 1 Congregational, and 1 Methodist. The following is a southern view of the Congregational church and other buildings in the vicinity, in the central part of the town. The village, which is situated on a commanding eminence, consists of about 30 well built dwelling houses, 4 mercantile stores, 1 bank, (the Thomp son bank,) and a printing office. At the time the following drawing was taken, a new Baptist church was erecting. It is situated a few rods north osthe Congregational church. This place is 14 miles from Brooklyn, 34 from Norwich, 47 from Hartford, 27 from Providence and 53 from Boston. There are in the town 6 or 7 cotton factories, which do an extensive business. There are also two or three woolen factories. Masonville, on French river, is perhaps the largest manufacturing village in the town, and is about a mile and a half from the center. The factory at this place was formerly called the \" Swamp Factory,\" from its being situated in a marshy spot. Fishersville is about a mile north, on the same stream. The village of New Boston is situated in the northwest corner osthe town, about six miles from the center ; the village is built on both sides osthe Quinnebaug. * The museum of Mr. Davis, contains the largest and best collection in Geology of any in the county. 56"], [462, "442 THOMPSON. South view of Thompson, (central part.) Thompson was a favorite residence osthe Nipmuck Indians. Quinna tisset, one of their chiefs, had a splendid wigwam near where the present Congregational church now stands ; their strong hold, however, was on Fort bill, about three fourths of a mile easterly ; the foundations of their fortress can now be traced. The adjoining forests, now covered with ancient trees, still display their corn fields, in rows and hills, as re gular as the best farmer would now have them. The neighboring streams and ponds afforded them great supplies of fish. Tbe Char goggagoggmanchogaggogg Pond, situated partly in this town, and partly in Webster, Mass, is said to be sixty miles in circumference, if followed in all its indentations. It is studded with beautiful islands, and was considered the paradise osthe Nipmucks and their women. There fish and game were in abundance, and there, they believed, were the enchanted islands and Elysian Fields, the abode of departed souls, and the residence osthe Great Spirit. Thompson was made a society, for ecclesiastical purposes, by the General Assembly, in their session in May, 1728. It was called Thompson parish, being then a part of the town of Killingly. The first sermon ever preached in the place was by a Mr. Wales, on the first Sunday in August of that year. On Feb. 25th, 1730, a church consisting of 27 members was organized, and on the same day the Rev. Marston Cabot, from Salem, Mass, was ordained their first minis ter. The attending clergy on this occasion were Mr. Coit from Plain field, Mr. Throope of Woodstock, Mr. Fisk of Killingly, Mr. Hale of Ashsord, and Mr. Williams of Pomfret. \" Mr. Cabot was a man of great piety, and of most amiable and engaging manners, and a descen dant of the famous Sebastian Cabot.

The greater part of the tract now comprising the town, was granted in 1696 to the volunteers in the Narragansett war, from which circumstance the town derives its name. \" From the first settlement of the colony,\" says Dr. Trum bull, \" it had been customary to make grants of lands to officers, sol diers and others, who had been especially serviceable to the colony. Grants had been made to Major Mason, to his officers and soldiers in the Pequot war. This encouraged the volunteers, who had perform ed such signal feats in the Narragansett war, to make application to the Assembly for the grant of a new township, as an acknowledgment of their services.\" Voluntown is bounded n. by Sterling and Plainfield, e. by Rhode Island, s. by North Stonington, and w. by Griswold. It is about 9 miles in length, and averages more than 4 in breadth. The surface is generally diversified by hills and valleys, but there are some sections of pine plains which are level. The prevailing character of the soil is that of a light, sandy and gravelly loam. There are 2 houses of wor ship in the town, 1 Congregational and 1 Baptist. A Congregational church stands on the dividing line between this town and Sterling, and is called the \" Line Meeting House.\" In the western part of the town, there are 1 woolen and 2 cotton factories. The central part osthe town is about 14 miles from Norwich. WINDHAM. In February, 1675, Joshua, son of Uncas, the Mohegan sachem, by his last will, gave unto Capt. John Mason, James Fitch, and fourteen others, commonly called Joshua's legatees, the tract containing the town of Windham, which originally included the present towns of Mansfield and Canterbury. In May, 1686, the main street in Wind ham was laid out, and fourteen lots for the legatees were surveyed. Other roads were made, lots surveyed, and purchases made for settle ment in the two following years. \" Lieut.

He landed first in Virginia, where he procured a negro servant to attend him. But when advertisements and pursuers were spread through this country, to apprehend the adherents of the Protec tor, he left Virginia, came to New York, and from thence to Norwich. Still feeling that he should be securer in a more retired place, he came to the new plantation, dug the first cellar, and with his servant, rarsed in Windham the first English habitation, in the spring of 1689. The settlers, rapidly increasing, petitioned the General Court, and obtained a grant of town privileges in May, 1692.\"f It was made a county town in May, 1726 ; the grand list in 1768 was about \u00a330,000, and the number of inhabitants 3,500. Eastern view of Windham. The present town of Windham is bounded north by the towns of Hampton, Chaplin and Mansfield, east by Canterbury, south by Frank lin and Lisbon, and west by Lebanon and Columbia. The township has a mean length from east to west of about eight miles, with a me dium breadth of nearly six miles. The surface of the town is gen erally billy, particularly the eastern part, comprising the parish of Scot land. The soil in the western part, bordering on the Shetucket, is rather light and dry ; there is, however, a considerable tract of fertile land in this section of the town.

The Congregational church is seen nearly in the center of the engraving. Dr. Dwight, in the third volume of his travels, in noticing this building, pleasantly remarks, \" that the spot where it is posited, bears not a little resemblance to a pound ; and it appears as if those who pitched upon it, intended to shut the church out of the town, and the inhabitants out of the church.\" Wind ham village is 30 miles east of Hartford, 14 from Norwich city, and 44 west of Providence. Since the removal of tbe seat of justice for the county to Brooklyn, and the establishment of the flourishing village of Willimantic, on the western border of the town, the ancient village of Windham has somewhat declined. It is said that there were more buildings in Windham village previous to the Revolution, than there has been at any time since. There are now in the place six mercantile stores, and about 60 dwelling houses. There are two houses of wor ship, one Congregational and one Episcopal. There is one bank in the town. It is said there was originally a handsome square laid out in the cen ter of the village. While some of the principal men were absent, and at a lime when party spirit was prevailing, a vote of the town was ob tained for selling off the principal part of the square for building lots, and it was accordingly used for that purpose. This is slated to be the cause of the singular situation of the church, and the clustered appear ance of the village. The Rev. Samuel Whiting was tbe first minister in Windham ; he was born in 1670, and was the son of the Rev. John Whiting, minis ter of Hartford. He received his early education from his father, and afterwards finished his education for the ministry under the direction of the Rev. James Fitch of Norwich, there being no college in Connecti cut at that time. At the first town meeting in Windham, June 11th, 1692, it was voted to apply to Mr. Whiting to carry on the work of the ministry. Previous to this, those whose circumstances would admit, used to attend meeting at Norwich, the distance of twelve miles, in a rough and unsubdued road. \" Tradition says, and from the records it ap pears it may say correctly, that the first sermon Mr. Whiting preached at Windham, was on the first day of the week, and the first day of the year, from the first chapter of the Bible, and from the first verse.\" In May, 1693, as an inducement to tarry with them sour years, they of fered him \u00a350 a year, an allotment through all the division lots, and to build him a house two stories high and 18 feet square. The land was laid out to him, and for the first year, instead of a house, they added \u00a310 to his salary. In 1696, they built him a house; in 1697, they \"ave him a call to ordination. In 1699, it was repeated, and 80 loads of wood added to his salary. In December, 1700, he was or dained, and the first church was gathered. His salary was afterwards raised to \u00a3100, and his wood. In 1725, being on a visit to his friends, he was suddenly seized with the pleurisy, and died at the house of the Rev. Mr. Collins, of Enfield. He was the father of 13 children, 8 sons and 5 daughters."], [466, "446 WINDHAM. The Rev. Thomas Clap, afterwards president of Yale College, was the second minister in Windham. He was ordained in 1726, and preached in the place till 1740. Mr. Clap received \u00a3300 settlement, \u00a3100 annual salary, and \u00a310 yearly for his wood. The Rev. Stephen White was their next pastor, and was ordained in 1740. He continued in the ministry 53 years, till his death, January 9th, 1693. Mr. White, in his half century sermon, preached January 1st, 1790, says, \u2014 \"When I came to this town, there were some of the first settlers living. They are now dead, and almost all the next generation. In those days there were 'scarce any that were not professors of religion, and but few in fants not baptized. No families that were prayerless. Profane swear ing was little known ; and open violations of the Sabbath not practiced as is common now, and there were no Deists among us. The people, as a body, were fearers of the Lord, and observers of the Sabbath and its duties. But the present day is peculiar for men's throwing off the fear of the Lord. Declensions in religion have been increasing for about 30 years past. Such as profaneness, disregard of the Sabbath, neglect of family religion, unrighteousness and intemperance, the im bibing of modern errors and heresies, and the crying prevalence of in fidelity against the clearest light.

Southwestern view of Frog Pond, Windham. Much pleasantry has been indulged at the expense osthe inhabitants ofAVindham, on account of a singular occurrence which happened in the year 1758, by which the inhabitants were very much frightened. The following is from a sheet recently printed in the county, entitled \"Lawyers and Bull-frogs,\" and will show the cause of the fright. There is probably considerable exaggeration in the introduction, as well as in the song, though the foundation osthe story is believed to be a matter of fact. It is inserted as an amusing relic osthe times. \" On a dark cloudy dismal night in the month of July, A. D. 1758, the inhabitants of Windham, a small town in the eastern part of Connecticut, had retired to rest, and for several hours, all were wrapped in profound repose \u2014 when suddenly, soon after midnight, the slumbers of the peaceful inhabitants were disturbed by a most terrific noise in the sky right over their heads, which to many, seemed the yells and screech es of infuriated Indians, and others had no other way of accounting for the awful sounds, which slill kept increasing, but by supposing the day of judgment had certain ly come, and to their terrified imaginations, the awful uproar in the air seemed the immediate precursor of the clangor of the last trumpet. At intervals, many supposed they could distinguish the calling out of the particular names, as of Cols. Dyer and Elof.rkin, two eminent lawyers, and this increased the general terror But soon there was a rush from every house, the tumult in the air still increasing \u2014 old and young, male and female, poured forth into the streets, \" in puris naturalibus,\" entire ly forgetful, in their hurry and consternation, of their nether habiliments, and with eyes upturned tried to pierce the almost palpable darkness. My venerable informant, who well recollects the event, says that some daring \"spirits,\" concluding there was nothing supernatural in the hubbub and uproar over head, but rather, lhat they heard the yells of Indians commencing a midnight attack, loaded their guns and sallied forth to meet the invading foes. These valiant heroes, on ascending the hill that bounds the village on the east, perceived that the sounds came from that quarter, and not from the skies, as first believed, but their courage would not permit them to proceed to"], [468, "448 WINDHAM. the daring extremity of advancing eastward, until they had discovered the real cause of alarm and distress, which pervaded the whole village. Towards morning the sounds in the air seemed to die away In the morning, the whole cause ot alarm, which produced such distressing apprehensions among the good people of the town, was apparent to all who took the trouble to go to a certain mill pond, situated about three fourths of a mile eastward of the village. This pond, herealter, in the annals of Fame, forever to be called the Frog Pond, in consequence of a severe drought, which had prevailed many weeks, had become nearly dry, and the Bull Frogs (with which it was densely populated) at the mill fought a pitched battle on the sides ot the ditch which ran through it, for the possession and enjoyment of the fluid which re mained. Long and obstinately was the contest maintained ; and many thousands of the combatants were found defunct, on both sides of the ditch, the next morning. It had been uncommonly still, for several hours before the battle commenced, but sud denly, as if by a preconcerted agreement, every frog on one side of the ditch, raised the war cry, Col. Dyer, Col. Dyer, and at the same instant, from the opposite side, re sounded the adverse shout of Elder kin too, Elder kin too. Owing to some peculiar state of the atmosphere, the awful noises and hamites to be directly over their heads cries appeared to the distressed Wind- Good people all, both great and small, Of every occupation, I pray draw near, and lend an ear To this our true relation. Another's heart was touch'd in part, But not prick'd to the center; Rather than pay one half away, His soul he said he'd venture. Then they agreed to go with speed, And see what was the matter, And as they say, they by the way Repenting tears did scatter. 'Twas of a fright, happen'd one night, Caused by the bull-frog nation, As strange an one as ever was known, In all our generation. The frogs we hear, in bull-frog shire, Their chorister had buried, The saddest loss, and greatest cross, That ever they endured. They traveled still, unto the'hill, With those men they did rally, And soon they found the doleful sound To come out of the valley. Thus being deprived, they soon contrived Their friends to send to, greeting, Even to all, both great and small, To hold a general meeting. Then down they went, with one consent, And found those frogs a singing, Raising their voice, for to rejoice, This was the doleful ringing. Subject and lord, with one accord, Now came with bowels yearning, For to supply and qualify, And fit a frog for learning. Home those great men, returned then, Filled with wrath and malice, And mustered all, both great and small, From prison and from palace. For to supply, immediately, The place of their deceased, There did they find one to their mind, Which soon their sorrows eased. And armed with fury, both Judge and Jury, To the Frog Pond moved, And as they say, a fatal day, To the frogs it proved. This being done, the glorious sun Being down and night advancing, With great delight, they spent the night, This terrible night, the Parson did fright His people almost in despair, For poor Windham souls, among the bean poles, He made a most wonderful prayer. In music and in dancing. And when they sung, the air it rung, And when they broke in laughter, It did surprise both learned and. wise, As you shall find hereafter. Lawyer Lucifer called up his crew, Dyer and Elderkin, you must come too ; Old Col. Dyer, you know well enough, He had an old negro, his name was Cuff A negro man, we understand, Awoke and heard the shouting, He ne'er went abroad, but awak'd his lord, Which fill'd their hearts with doubting. Now massa, says Cuff, I'm now glad enough, For what little comfort I have; I make it no doubt, my time is just out, No longer shall I be a slave. With one accord, they went abroad, And stood awhile to wonder : The bull-frog shout appeared no doubt, To them like claps of thunder. As for Larabie, so quietly was he, He durst not stir out of his house, The poor guilty soul crept into his hole, And there lay as still as a mouse. Which made them say, the judgment day, Without a doubt was coming, For in the air, they did declare, Was very awful drumming. As for Jemmy Flint, he began to repent, For a Bible he ne'er had known, His life was so bad, he'd give half he had, To old father Stoughton for one. Those lawyer's fees would give no ease, Tho' well they're worth inditing ; To pray they kneel\u2014 alas, they feel The worm of conscience biting. Those armed men, they killed then, And scalp'd about two hundred, Taking I say their lives away, And then their camp they plundered. Being thus dismayed, one of them said, He would make restitution, He would restore one half or more, This was his resolution. Those lusty frogs, they fought like dogs, For which I do commend them, But lost the day, for want, I say, Of weapons to defend them."], [469, "449 WOODSTOCK. I had this story set before me, Just as I have writ it, It being so new, so strange and true, I could not well omit it. For if you do ill, I'll have you know, Conscience again will smite you, The bull frog shout will ne'er give out, But rise again aud light yon. Lawyers, I say, now from this day, Be honest in your dealing, And never more increase your store, While you the poor are killing. Now Lawyers, Parson, Bull Frogs all, I bid you all farewell, And unto you I loudly call, A better talc to tell. WOODSTOCK. In 16SG, many of the inhabitants of Roxbury, in Massachusetts, re ceived from the government of that colony, a grant of a tract of land in the southern part of the colony, for a settlement, which was named Woodstock.* This town was bounded by Woodward and Saffery 's line, and was afterwards found to be within the limits of Connecticut. It was first called New Roxbury. In 1713, the line between Connecticut and Massachusetts was sur veyed, and upon certain conditions, it was agreed by Connecticut, that the towns settled by Massachusetts should remain under its jurisdiction. This compromise produced general uneasiness and dissatisfaction with the inhabitants at the time, which instead of subsiding, as was expected, continued to increase, so that in May, 1747, they presented a memorial to the General Assembly of Connecticut, praying to be annexed to, or taken under the jurisdiction thereof, whereby they might be restored to the chartered privileges granted to them, in common with the other citizens of this state. The General Assembly, after having appointed commissioners to attempt to settle this dispute, with others that might be appointed by Massachusetts, without effect, adopted a resolution, that as the agreement of 1713 had never received the royal confirma tion, it was not binding; and that all the inhabitants who lived south of Massachusetts, as defined by the charter, were entitled to the privi leges and ought to be subject to the jurisdiction of the government of this state. In 1752, an act was passed, securing to the several religious societies of the aforesaid towns, all the rights and privileges of religious societies according to the laws of this colony. These proceedings on the part of Connecticut, produced a remonstrance to his majesty. This was op posed by the agent of Connecticut, then in England, and the claims of the latter supported, which were finally recognized, and the boundary established accordingly in 1755. Woodstock is bounded n. by the Massachusetts line, e. by Thomp son, w. by Union and Ashsord, and s. by Pomfret and Ashsord. It is 8 miles long, and upwards of 7 in breadth.

It is best adapted to grazing, but generally admits ot til lage; and considerable quantities of grain are annually raised, consisting principally of rye and corn, and it may be considered one of the richest agricultural towns in this part of the state. There are 4 woolen and 4 cotton factories in the limits of the town. There are also about JOU persons engaged in the shoe making business, principally in the western part of the town. The town is divided into three parts, viz. the old society of Woodstock, West Woodstock or New Roxbury, and Muddy Brook society or North Woodstock. There are six houses of worship in the town, 4 Congregational, 1 Baptist, and 1 Methodist. South view of the Congregational Church, Woodstock.

The village of Muddy Brook, or North Woodstock, is about three miles distant, situated in a beautiful valley, through which Muddy Brook, a fine mill stream, passes. The village is in two parts, in each of which is a Congregational church, upwards of one mile dis tant from each other. The houses in this village are more clustered than in any other part of the town, and viewed from the surrounding hills present an uncommonly beautiful appearance. The west part is called \" Village corner.\" i\u00a3 Gen. William Eaton was a native of this town, and was born Feb ruary 23d, 1764. At a very early period he disclosed strong indica tions of intellectual vigor, and of mental eccentricity. At the age of"], [471, "451 WOODSTOCK. about 16 years, without the knowledge or consent of his parents, he went from home, and enlisted into the army. This was in 1780, near the close of the Revolutionary war; and young Eaton continued in the army until the close of the war, a considerable part of the time in the humble station of a private soldier; but he attained the rank of a ser geant. After the peace, in 1784, he commenced the study of the Latin language, and the year after, was admitted a member of Dartmouth College, where he graduated in 1790, the period of his collegiate life having been protracted, from the circumstance of his having devoted a portion of his time to school keeping, which his want of pecuniary re sources rendered necessary. \" In October, 1791. he was chosen clerk of the House of Delegates of Vermont, re siding at that time in the town of Windsor, where he had been engaged in school keeping. In March, 1792, he was appointed a captain in the army of the United States; and whilst in this situation, he performed various services upon the western and southern fronliers. He continued in the army until 1797, when he was appointed consul to Tunis. He continued in this difficult (and it may be added, perilous) situa tion until 1803, during which period, he discharged the consular functions with great firmness and ability. In 1804, Gen. Eaton lelurned to America and visited Washing ton, where he disclosed ihe famous enterprise which he had planned to restore the ex bashaw of Tripoli, and having obtained the sanction of government, he embarked in July of the same year, in the Argus sloop of w\"ar, with the intention of engaging in this bold and hazardous undertaking, and arrived at Alexandria in Egypt, on the 25th of November following. From Alexandria he proceeded to Cairo, where he found the ex-bashaw, who approved of the enterprise, and after having made suitable ar rangements, and recruited about 500 men, (100 of which only were Christians,) it was determined by Eaton and the ex-bashaw to cross the desert and seize the province and city of Derne. After a difficult and fatiguing journey, through a dreary desert, pre senting innumerable obstacles, they arrived within the province of Derne, and soon attacked and captured ihe city, having the assistance of the Hornet sloop of war. The boldness and desperate bravery of Gen. Eaton and his little party, alarmed the reigning bashaw and his barbarian subjects, who almost thought ihey were something more than human beings; but the progress of Gen. Eaton was arrested by a peace which the American consul concluded with the bashaw. After this, Gen. Eaton re turned to his native country, and was every where received with the most distinguish ed applause, the grateful tribute of patriotic and heroic achievements. After some lime lie fixed his residence in Brimfield, Massachusetts, where he continued until his death in 1811. Whilst here he was elected a representative of the town, in the legis lature osthe state. \"Gen. Eaton was a very extraordinary character; he possessed much original genius, was bold in his conceptions, ardent in his passions, determined in his resolu tions, and indefatigably persevering in his conduct.

LITCHFIELD. The tract of land now comprised in the township of Litchfield, was called by the native Indians Bantam. In 17J8, it was purchased of the colony of Connecticut by a company, who divided their purchase, (which was intended to cover ten miles square,) into sixty shares, under the name of \"proprietors' rights,\" which were valued at \u00a35 per right. The proprietors who made the purchase and first settlement, were prin cipally from Hartlord, Windsor and Lebanon. In 1720 and 1721 sev eral families began to settle on the tract. \u00ab Nothing appears on record to show that the proprietors purchased any osthe lands in this town of the Indians : the title having been previously extinguished by the colo ny. The lands in this town afforded better hunting ground for the In dians, than extensive mtervals. Many of the hills were nearly cleared"], [473, "453 LITCHFIELD. of trees by fires, kindled for the purpose of hunting. To this remark, however, many valuable tracts, containing excellent pine and other sorest trees, were an important exception.\" In 1724, Bantam was incorporated as a town by the name of Litch field. \" By the act of incorporation, the grant was made to John Marsh of Hartford, to John Buel of Lebanon, and their associates ; amounting to fifty seven. The first sounders built log houses. The settlement proceeded as fast as could be reasonably expected, considering the cir cumstances of the times. During the wars between England and France, the Canadians and Indians often harassed our borders; and Litchfield, being a frontier town, was exposed to their ravages. Between the year 1720 and 1730, five houses were surrounded with palisadoes. One of these stood on the ground near the present court house ; ano ther about half a mile south ; one east, and one west of the center ; and one in South Farms. Soldiers were then stationed here to guard the inhabitants, both while they were at work in the field, and while they were attending public worship on the Sabbath. \" In May, 1722, Capt. Jacob Griswould, being at work alone in the field, about one mile west of the present court house, two Indians sud denly rushed upon him from the woods, took him and pinioned his arms, and carried him off. They traveled in a northerly direction, and the same day arrived in some part of the township called Canaan, then a wilderness. The Indians kindled a fire, and after binding their prisoner hand and foot, lay down to sleep. Griswould fortunately disengaging his hands and feet, while his arms were yet pinioned, seized their guns, and made his escape into the woods. After traveling a small distance, he sat down and waited till the dawn of day ; and, although his arms were still pinioned, he carried both the guns. The savages awoke in the morning, and finding their prisoner gone, they immediately pursued him ; they soon overtook him, and kept in sight of him the greater part of the day, while he was making his way homeward. When they came near, he turned and pointed one of his pieces at them ; they then fell back. In this manner he traveled till near sunset, when he reached an eminence in an open field, about one mile northwest of the present court house. He then discharged one of his guns, which immediately summoned the people to his assistance. The Indians fled, and Gris would safely returned to his family.\" \" The capture of Griswould made the inhabitants more cautious for a while, but their fears soon subsided. In the month of August fol lowing Mr. Joseph Harris, a respectable inhabitant, was at work in the woods alone, not far from the place were Griswould was taken ; and bein<r attacked by a party of Indians, attempted to make his escape. The Indians pursued him, and finding they could not overtake him, they shot him dead and scalped him. As Harris did not return, the inhabitants were alarmed, and some search was made for him ; but the darkness of the night checked their exertions.

The first minister in the place was the Rev. Timothy Collins, a native of Guilford, who graduated at Yale College in 1718. Mr. Collins accepted the call of the inhabitants to be their minister, in December, 1721, and was ordained in June, 1723 ; the following salary was voted, viz. \u00a357 for the first four years ; for the fifth year \u00a360 ; for the next year, \u00a370 ; and for the seventh year, and so long as he should continue with them in the work of the minis try, \u00a380. His fire wood was voted him in addition to his salary. Mr. Collins continued in the ministry till 1752, when he was dismissed at his own request. In the following year he was appointed a justice of the peace. He also practiced physic. He died in Litchfield, in 1776. In April, 1723, the inhabitants voted to build their first church, which was finished within three years. Its dimensions were 45 feet in length, and 35 in breadth ; it was built in a plain manner, without a steeple. It stood within a few feet of the present Congregational church. At the raising of this building all the adult males in the town were present, and sat on the sills at once. The second house of worship was finished in 1762 ; this also has been taken down, and a new building has been recently erected. The first Episcopal society was formed in this town about the year 1746, but they had only occasional preaching till the year 1754. At this time Mr. Solomon Palmer, who had just been dis missed from the church in Cornwall, took the charge of the Episcopal congregation in this town, and that of New Milford at the same time, and preached to them alternately. Mr. Palmer continued here until 1763, when he removed to the Episcopal congregation in New Haven. In 1766, he resumed his charge in Litchfield, and continued it till his death, in 1770.J- Litchfield, the seat of justice for the county, is situated in north lati tude 41\u00b0 50', being 30 miles west from Hartford, 36 northwest from New Haven, and 100 from New York ; bounded north by Goshen and Torrington, west by Washington and Warren, east by Nauga tuc river, separating it from Harwinton, and south by Watertown, Bethlem and Plymouth. It is about 9 miles in length from east to west, and its breadth is nearly 8 miles. It is an elevated township, and its surface presents a diversity of hills and valleys. The hills are gen erally of considerable elevation, and their prevailing course is from north to south. In the western part of the town there are some moun tainous tracts, which comprise several considerable eminences, of which Mount Tom is the most elevated.

Litchfield abounds in good springs of water, and from its elevated situ ation, the air is generally pure and salubrious, and the town has the reputation of being remarkably healthy. The soil is generally strong and fertile, and, for an elevated tract, is warm and favorable for vegeta tion.* Litchfield is divided into four societies, Litchfield proper, South Farms, North-field, and Milton. Litchfield village was incorporated in 1818. It is delightfully situated, upon an elevated plain in the cen ter osthe first society, affording the most extensive prospects, surround ed by interesting scenery, and from its situation enjoying a salubrious atmosphere. The corporate limits of the village are about one mile and a half in length, and about one mile in breadth. The principal street, running from n. w. to s. e. is well built, comprising numerous handsome dwelling houses, some of which are elegant edifices. This street is intersected by another, forming a pleasant square in the center. There are in the village upwards of 80 dwelling houses, 2 printing offices, a bank, being a branch of the Ph\u0153nix Bank, Hartford ; court house, jail, professional offices, mercantile and mechanic shops. In 1784, a law school was established here by the Hon. Tapping Reeve. In 1798, the Hon. James Gould was associated as a joint instructor with Judge Reeve. This school was considered as the most respecta ble and systematic law school in the United States. It was discontin ued a few years since. There is a high school for young ladies, which is of considerable celebrity. There is an infirmary in this town, under the direction of Dr. Alanson Abbe, established for the purpose of curing and relieving diseases osthe spine. South Farms was incorporated into an ecclesiastical society, in 1767. In the year 1753, when Mr. Champion was settled in Litchfield, there were but 30 families in the parish; when it was incorporated, it con tained seventy. In 1764, the inhabitants agreed to build their first church. It was only one story high, 34 feet by 32: the second house of worship was erected in 1785. An academy was begun in South Farms, in 1790, by James Morris, Esq. in which the higher branches of education were taught. This school is still kept up, and is a re spectable institution. Northfield parish was incorporated in 1794. It is situated in the southeast corner of Litchfield, and includes within its limits part of the township of Plymouth. The surface of this parish is uneven, and many parts are stony, rough, and hard for tillage. The soil is generally good, and produces good grass and grain. There are two houses for worship in this place, 1 Congregational and 1 Episcopal. The first Congregational minister, the Rev. Joseph E. Camp, was settled here in 1795. * There is an apple tree now standing on the farm ofMr. Solomon Marsh, in Litch field, supposed to be about 116 years old, and is now in a vigorous state. Its trunk, two feet from ihe ground, measures eleven feet five inches in circumference. The cir cumference of its branches is nearly eleven rods in extent. It bore in 1835, one hun dred bushels of apples of a fine quality."], [476, "456 LITCHFIELD. Milton is situated in the northwest corner of Litchfield. It was in corporated in 1795, and the first minister was Mr. Benjamin Judd, who was installed in 1802. The parish embraces within its limits a part of Goshen, Cornwall, and Warren. The surface of the parish is uneven and stony, with many large primitive rocks, and though good grazing land, is hard for tillage. There is a mineral spring in the west part of Litchfield, near a place called Bradleysville, \" which is saturated with iron and sulphur. The water issues from the east side osthe mountain in considerable quanti ties. The mud from the bottom of the spring burns with a blue flame, and the principal part of it consumes.\" An Indian relic was found in this town, about a half a mile east of the court house, near Bantam river. It is a rude sculpture of brown stone, nearly the size of life, rep resenting a female with head and shoulders, extending down to the waist : it is now deposited at Yale College, New Haven. Ethan Allen, a brigadier general in the American service, distin guished for his daring and intrepid spirit, was a native of this town. There has been a considerable diversity of statements respecting the place of his birth. Cornwall, Salisbury and Roxbury, have been named as places where he was born. By an examination of the Litchfield town records the present year, (1836,) it is recorded that he was the son of Joseph and Mary Allen, and was born Jan. 10th, 1737. The fact of the differing statements, mentioned above, seems to have origi nated from the circumstance of his residing for a while in those towns. The following sketch of his life is from Allen's Biographical Dictionary. \" While he was young, his parents emigrated to Vermont. At the commencement of the disturbances in this territory, about the year 1770, he took a most active part in favor osthe Green Mountain boys, as the settlers were then called, in opposition to the government of New York. An act of outlawry against him was passed by this state, and 500 guineas were offered for his apprehension: but his party was too numerous and faithful to permit him to be disturbed by any apprehensions for his safety: in all the struggles of the day he was successful ; and he not only proved a valuable friend to those whose cause he had espoused, but he was humane and generous towards those with whom he had to contend. When called to take the field, he showed himself an able leader and an intrepid soldier. \" The news of the battle of Lexington determined Col. Allen to engage on the side of his country, and inspired him with the desire of demonstrating his attachment to liberty by some bold exploit. While his mind was in this state, a plan for taking Ti conderoga and Crown Point by surprise, which was formed by several gentlemen in Connecticut, was communicated to him, and he readily engaged in the project. Re ceiving directions from the General Assembly of Connecticut to raise the Green Moun tain boys, and conduct the enterprise, he collected 230 of the hardy settlers and pro ceeded to Castleton. Here he was unexpectedly joined by Col. Arnold, who had been commissioned by the Massachusetts committee to raise 400 men, and effect the same object, which was now about to be accomplished. As he had not raised the men, he was admitted to act as an assistant to Col. Allen. They reached the lake opposite Ti conderoga on the evening of the 9th of Mav, 1775. With the utmost difficulty boats were procured, and 83 men were landed near the garrison. The approach of day ren dering it dangerous to wait for the rear, it was determined immediately to proceed. The commander in chief now addressed his men, representing that they had been for a number of years a scourge to arbitrary power, and famed for their valor, and con cluded with saying, I now propose to advance before you, and in person conduct you through the wicket gate; and you, that will go with me voluntarily in this desperate attempt, poise your firelocks. At the head of the center file he marched instantly to the gale, where a sentry snapped his gun at him, and retreated through the covered way: he pressed forward into the fort, and formed his men on the parade in such a manner as to face two opposite barracks. Three huzzas awaked the garrison A"], [477, "S\u00c6AST VIEW \u00a9IF LDT'\u00a3IHIIFIlEIL[S>,FR\u00a9Rfl dHlESNIJT HlltLL, I"], [478, ""], [479, "457 LITCHFIELD. sentry, who asked quarter, pointed out the apartments of the commanding officer; and Allen with a drawn sword over the head of Capt. De la Place, who was undressed, de- manded the surrender of the fort. ' By what authority do you demand it?' inquired the astonished commander. ' I demand it (said Allen) in the name of the great Jeho- vah and osthe continental Congress.' The summons could not be disobeyed, and the tort, with its very valuable stores and 49 prisoners, was immediately surrendered. Crown Point was taken the same day, and the capture of a sloop of war, soon after- wards, made Allen and his brave party complete masters of Lake Champlain. \" In the fall of 1775 he was sent twice into Canada to observe the dispositions of ihe people, and attach them, if possible, to the American cause. During this last lour Col. Brown met him, and proposed an attack upon Montreal in concert. The proposal was eagerly embraced, and Col. Allen, with 110 men, near 80 of whom were Canadians, crossed the river in the night of Sept. 24. In the morning he wailed with impatience tor the signal from Col. Brown, who agreed to cooperate with him, but he waited in vain. He made aresolutedefen.se against an atlackof 500 men, and it was not till his own parly was reduced by desertions to the number of31, and he had retreated near a mile, that he surrendered. A moment afterwards a furious savage rushed towards him, and presented his firelock, with the intent ofkillmg him. It was only by making use of the body of the officer, to whom he had given his sword, as a shield, that he es- caped destruction. \" He was now kept for some time in irons, and treated with great cruelty. He was sent to England as a prisoner, being assured that the halter would be the reward of his rebellion, when he arrived there. After his arrival, about the middle of December, he was lodged for a short time in Pendennis Castle, near Falmouth. On the 8th of Janu- ary, 1776, he was put on board a frigate, and by a circuitous route carried to Halifax. Here he remained: confined in the gaol from June to October, when he was removed to New York. During the passage to this place, Capt. Burke, a daring prisoner, pro- posed io kill the Biitish captain and seize the frigate; but Col. Allen refused to engage in the plot, and was probably ihe means of preserving the life of Capt. Smith, whohad treated him very politely. He was kept at New York about a year and a half, some- times imprisoned, and sometimes permitted to be on parole. * \u00bb * * \" Col. Allen was exchanged for Col. Campbell, May 0, 1778, and after having repair- ed to head quarters, and offered his services to Gen. Washington, in case his health should be restored, he returned to Vermont. His arrival, on the evening of the last of May, gave his friends great joy, and it was announced by the discharge of cannon. As an expression of confidence in his patriotism and military talents, he was soon appoint- ed to the command osthe stale militia. It does not appear, however, that his intrepid- ity was ever again brought to the test, though his patriotism was tried by an unsuccess- ful attempt of the British to bribe him to attempt a union of Vermont with Canada. He died suddenly at his estate in Colchester, Feb. 13, 1789. \"Gen. Allen possessed strong powers of mind, but the)' never felt the influence of education. Though he was brave, humane aud generous, yet his conduct does not seem to have been much influenced by considerations respecting that holy and merci- ful Being, whose character and whose commands are disclosed to us in the scriptures. His notions with regard to religion were such, as to prove, thai those, who ralher con- fide in their own wisdom than seek instruction from heaven, may embrace absurdities, which would disgrace the understanding of a child. He believed, with Pythagoras, that man after death would transmigrate into beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles, &c, and of ten informed his friends, that he himself expected to live again in the form ol a large white horse. Besides a number of pamphleis in the controversy with New York, he published in 1779 a narrative of his observations during his captivity, which has been lately reprinted; a vindication of the opposition of the inhabitants of Vermont to the government of New York, and their right to form an independent stale, 1779; and Al len's theology, or the oracles of reason, 1786. This last work was intended lo ridicule the doctrine of Moses and Ihe prophets. It would be unjust lo bring againsl it the charge of having effected great mischief in the world, for few have had the patience lo read it.\" Oliver Wolcott, signer osthe Declaration of Independence, was for many years a resident of this town : he was a native of East Windsor, born Dec. 1st, 1726, and was the son osthe Hon. Roger Wolcott, gov ernor of the colony of Connecticut. He was graduated at Yale Col lege in 1747. \" He commanded a company of soldiers in 1748, in the war against the French, in Canada.

The duties of all these stations he dis charged with unshaken integrity and firmness; courted savors from no man; and nei ther sought nor obtained any end by intrigue, or from interested motives. He was sin gularly modest, and even diffident, in his intercourse with men, in the common walks of life. Those who best knew this gentleman, well knew that the highest trust was never improperly placed in him. Two questions only were asked by him, while dis charging ihe duties of the several offices of high responsibility, which he held, viz. What is right 1 and, What is my duly ? He possessed a benevolent heart, and was warm in his friendships ; a firm friend to order; a promoter of peace; a lover of reli gion; and a tried, unshaken friend to the institutions osthe gospel. He was an inde fatigable student; and neither wasted his time nor his words. His mind was clear and penetrating; his views of political subjects, just and comprehensive; his discern ment osthe wisest means to promote the best ends, ready and exact; and his acquaint ance with science, particularly with theology, extensive. He had a remarkable talent at investigation; and 'nothing satisfied him but proof.'

Oliver Wolcott, son of the preceding, was born in 1760. When a lad of 17, he lent his aid to the cause of his country : he was present in the engagement with the British at the time of their invasion of Dan bury. On the formation osthe U. S. government in 1789, he was ap pointed first auditor of the treasury ; and in 1794 he succeeded Gen. Hamilton as secretary osthe treasury. In 1817 he was elected gover nor of Connecticut, which office he held till 1827. He was the last survivor osthe administration of Washington. He died in New York, June 2d, 1833.

His father was the clergyman of that place. He was graduated at Yale College in 1773. In 1776 he en tered the Revolutionary army, and soon received a major's commission from Washington, who honored him with his confidence, and entrusted him with several hazardous and important services. He was present in most osthe general battles which took place with the main army in the northern states, at Long Island, White Plains, Brandywine, German town, Monmouth, &c, besides many smaller engagements, with the command of his own detachment. He removed to Litchfield in 1784. In 1800 he was chosen a representative to Congress. He was an ardent patriot and sincere Christian. He died at Litchfield, March 7th, 1835. EXTRACTS FROM NEWSPAPERS.

John Newbree, Gaoler. Litchfield, May 12th, 1784. Every species of deception and villainy seems at present to be practiced: some by dress and titles impose upon the unwary; others, under the plain mask of itinerants, accomplish their detestable schemes. One osthe last description, on the night of the 7th of May, came into Capt. Vaille's tavern of this place, called for entertainment, and .soon went to his lodging: but after the family were retired to rest, he thought it time, after rifling the house of a calico gown, a camlet shirt, and three pair of shins, with six dollars from a fellow traveler, to take up his bed with all its furniture, and depart, and has since eluded the diligent search of those who have endeavored to detect him. It is lo be hoped for the honor of human nature, that people will be vigilant in exposing this crime, as well as detecting future villainies ; and that tavern keepers, in this western part osthe state especially, would not put too implicit confidence in strangers, for \"they know not at what hour of the night their effects and beds may, by the thief be taken away.\" Connecticut Journal, No. 942. Litchfield, Nov. 15, 1785. Last Wednesday Thomas Goss, late of Barkhamsted, was executed at this place, pursuant to the sentence of the Superior Court, for the murder of his wife. His de fense, upon trial, was insanity; and for the space of several days after his trial and condemnation, he appeared regular, and requested his attorney to make application to the General Assembly of the State, for a reprieve ; likewise desired the clergyman of this town to preach a sermon al his execution, (if he were not reprieved.) But vary soon he resumed his former notions, that wizards and witches haunted him ; which ideas it seems he had adopted, some time in October, 1784 ; and under pretence that his wife was a witch, he at first justified his conduct in depriving her oflife. Under such infatuation, he ordered his attorney, in most peremptory language, not to apply for a reprieve to any human tribunal ; alleging, that his heavenly Father had forbidden all such proceedings. He called himself the second Lamb of God; said he was brother of Jesus Christ; and sometimes said he was the child, born of the woman, mentioned in the Revelation of St. John, before whom the dragon stood, ready to devour the child, &c. To such extravagant ideas, he added, that the sheriff could not hang him; that his heavenly Father would interpose if the attempt was made, and he be liberated ; and that thirty thousand males above fifteen years would be instantly killed by the shock, in North America. He pertinaciously adhered to such wild opinions to the last moment of his life. The night preceding his execution he slept weli. In the forenoon of the same day, slept calmly a considerable length of time : \u2014 at dinner, ate heartily. On his way to the gallows, and while there, he appeared calm and unmoved ; not the least emotion could be discovered in his countenance; nor the least perturbation in his speech. On being told that he had but twenty minutes to live, he kneeled down and made a short prayer, and consented that a clergyman present should pray with him, (although he had refused his attention to either preaching or praying, and would not even hear the sermon preached on the day of his execution, pretending that God for bade him.) When on the gallows, he said a few words to the spectators, inculcating the general principles of morality ; such as that they had ought to bring up their fami lies well, and obey the precepts of his heavenly Father, or they must be miserable. He declared he never murdered any person in his life excepting his wife; and the last word he said was, that he believed the sheriff could not hang him. Litchfield, Dec. 12th, 1786. In the storm on Saturday evening last, the wife of Mr. Elisha Birge unfortunately perished. The fury osthe tempest seemed to threaten an immediate dismemberment osthe lonCT erected and decayed mansion of their residence : a naturally timid disposi tion induced Mrs. Birge fatally to determine on leaving it and seek an asylum in a neighboring house ; from which resolution she could not be persuaded to recede, how ever hazardous the attempt. She had not proceeded far, when Mr. Birge followed, and immediately overtook her: having wandered about the dreary waste some time, in fruitless search osthe friendly cottage, her helpless survivor suggested that they had mistook the road, and urged their return; but alas! too late \u2014 she was falling asleep: the chilling winds and hoary frost had deprived her of speech and sense, and beside the bending chest of an aged tree she expired in his arms. Those who knew her worth, cannot restrain the sympathetic tear. She was hospitable and good ; indulgent to her children; a comfort to the partner of hei bed; a blessing to her neighbors; and an ir reparable loss to the stranger and distressed.

Barkhamsted was granted to Capt. Thomas Moore and Lieut. Jon athan Ellsworth, and other persons of Windsor, in 1732. The first per son who made a permanent settlement in the town, was Pelatiah AHyn from Windsor. He removed here about tbe year 1746, and remained the only inhabitant of the town for 10 or 12 years. In the summer he employed his time in clearing and cultivating his lands, and in the win ter in hunting. His plantation was toward the south part of the town, near the dividing line between this town and New Hartford. As there were frequent alarms on account of the Indians, he used, when danger was apprehended, to repair to a fortified post in the northern part of New Hartford. He took special care to guard himself against a sur prise at his own house. The next man who made a settlement in the town, was Israel Jones, from Enfield, about the year 1759. Besides these, the first principal settlers were, William Austin, Jonathan King, and a Mr. Norton, from Suffield ; Amos Case from Simsbury, John Ives from Hamden, Joseph Shepherd from Hartford, and Joseph Wil der from East Haddam. Mr. Wilder was the first magistrate, and for several years the only one. The progress of the settlement was slow. In 1771 there were but 20 families in the limits of .the town, and the inhabitants were so few that they were not called upon to do military duty until 1774. The town was incorporated in 1779. The Rev. Ozias Eels, the first minister osthe town, was ordained January, 1787. He died in 1813. Barkhamsted is bounded north by Hartland, west by Winchester, east by Canton and Granby, and south by New Hartford. It is 6\u00a3 miles in length from east to west, and 5 miles in breadth. The central part is situated 23 miles northwest from Hartford. The township is rough, stony and mountainous, and is intersected by two high granite ridges of mountains, running north and south. Upon the declivities of these ridges, and upon their summits, there is much broken land, some of which is inaccessible. In some places these ridges exhibit very lofty and sublime features. Iron ore has been discovered in small quantities in different parts of the town, likewise some strata of limestone. The soil is hard and dry, and not generally good for tillage, except along the streams. The mountains and hills were formerly covered with excel lent timber, consisting of oak, chestnut, sugar maple, beech, pine and hemlock ; a considerable portion of which has been destroyed by wind and fire, and by the axe, under a system of improvidence, at a time when timber was considered of no value. The following is a representation of the principal part of the village of Hitchcocksville, in Barkhamsted ; it is situated on the west branch of the Farmington river, near the corner of four towns, Hartland, Cole brook, Winchester and Barkhamsted. The village contains upwards of 20 dwelling houses, 1 chair factory, 2 mercantile stores, and an Episco pal church, which was sounded July 4th, 1829, and called the Union church. Part of the chair factory is seen on the left, and the church"], [483, "461 BF.THLEM. West view of Hitchcocksville, Barkhamsted. on the right of the engraving. The village was commenced about fif teen years since : it is 20 miles from Litchfield, and 26 from Hartford. There are superior water privileges for extensive manufactories in the immediate vicinity. A little more than a mile south of this place, a few of the last remnants of the Narragansett Indians have a location ; they came here about the year 1779, and purchased about 200 or more acres of land. Their houses, or rather cabins, are along side of the road : there are about 20 souls that make their constant residence here, though at times they number as many as 30 persons. BETH L E M . Betiilf.m was formerly a part of Woodbury. It was incorporated as a distinct town in 1787. It is bounded n. by Litchfield, e. by Wa tertown, w. by Washington, and s. by Woodbury. Its average length is 4J, and its breadth 4 miles. The township is considerably hilly, and the soil generally a gravelly loam, and is best adapted to grazing ; there are, however, considerable quantities of rye raised in the limits of the town. The number of inhabitants in 1810 was 1,118; in 1830 the number was reduced to 906. The following is a representation osthe central part of Bethlem.

We learn from Bethlem, that such a distressing sickness has prevailed there of late, that in the month of November 34 persons died in that small town, but the distemper is somewhat mitigated. They are taken first with a cold, and then a malignant pleu risy sets in, and carries them off. Among others that died was Doct. Hull, his wife mid two children, aud a young man, all out of one house; the doctor and his wife were buried in one grave. Soon after their deaths, and while others were sick in the house, one Deacon Strong coining by, raised a flock of eleven quails, which flew over the before-mentioned house, and dropped in the garden ; immediately after three rose and flew into the bushes, but the other eight were picked up dead, and in an hour after stunk and were buried. The air in the parish is said by doctors and others of judg ment, to be apparently different from the air in towns and parishes round about it. Some doctors there, have been ready to call this distemper the plague, or something much like it. A robbery, which at the time caused considerable excitement in this place, took place in the east part osthe parish of Bethlem, called Gurnsey Town, in the spring of the year 1778 or 1779, at the house of Ebenezer Gurnsey, a wealthy farmer. Mr. Gurnsey had sold his farm some time before, to Isaac Baldwin of Woodbridge, who had moved in with Mr. Gurnsey, and had paid him a large sum of money. Mr. Gurnsey had a number of men in his employ in building a house on an adjoining farm.

When he was eighteen years old, he became a preacher. He was or dained in Bethlem in 1740. He died in 1790, in the 72d year of his age, and 50th of his ministry. \" He possessed a vigorous mind, and was well versed in theology. His style was plain and his manner im pressive. He held a high rank among his contemporaries as a preach er. During the great religious revival with which the churches were visited in 1742, he devoted much of his time to itinerant labor, and was the instrument of much good in many congregations. He was al so distinguished as a theological instructor, both by a happy method of teaching, and by the great number of young men who studied for the ministry under his care. The most important of his publications is his ' True Religion Delineated.' His works have been republished in three octavo volumes.\" CANAAN. Soutluvest vieiv osthe Housatonic Falls, Canaan. Canaan was sold at auction in New London, in January, 1738. The settlement began in June of the same year. The first inhabitants were Daniel and Isaac Lawrence, John Franklin, and others who joined the settlement about the same time. The town was incorporated in 1739. The first clergyman in the town was the Rev. Elisha Webster, who was ordained in October, 1740. Canaan is 41 miles northwest from Hartford, bounded north by the Massachusetts line, east by Norfolk, west by the Housatonic, dividing it from Salisbury, and south by Cornwall. It is about 9 miles in length from north to south, and its average breadth about six. The falls represented in the above engraving, are formed by a ledge of limestone rocks, crossing the Housaionic river obliquely from"], [486, "464 COLEBR00K. northwest to southeast : the length of the ledge is about 30 rods, its perpendicular height perhaps 60 feet, and its front irregular and broken. Here, in a formidable mass on the western side, and on the eastern, the water rushes from the rapid torrent above, and descending in every va riety of form, with the mass of foam at the bottom rising in a misty cloud, and the surrounding scenery presents a scene of remarkably pic turesque beauty. There are falls and rapids both above and below the main cataract, but of much smaller scale. \"The whole descent,\" says Dr. Dwight, \"is about 130 feet, nobly arranged and distributed, and comprehending a remarkable variety of beauty and grandeur.\" The buildings connected with the \"Salisbury Iron Manufacturing Co.\" are situated a short distance above the main fall, on the Salisbury side of the Housatonic ; there are also iron works below the falls, a forge and anchor shop are on the Canaan side. This place is 18 miles from Litchfield, 45 from Hartford, and 4 from Salisbury center. The face of the township is broken and mountainous. Considerable quantities of limestone have been quarried. COLEBROOK. Colebrook is an elevated township, the central part of which is 31 miles northwest from Hartford, and 18 miles northeast from Litchfield, bounded north by the Massachusetts line, east by Hartland, west by Norfolk, and south by Winchester. Its length from east to west is six miles, and its average breadth five. The township is hilly and moun tainous, and the soil a hard gravelly loam, and generally stony. It is in general rather cold and wet, but affords tolerable good grazing. The main branch of the Farmington river intersects the eastern part of the town, and affords excellent mill seats. The population of the town in 1810 was 1,243 ; in 1S30, it was 1,332. It is said that in the year 1796, some laborers in this town, digging to the depth of nine or ten feet, found three large tusks, and two thigh bones, the latter of which measured each about four feet and four inches in length, and twelve inches and a half in circumference. It is added that when first discovered they were entire ; but that as soon as they were exposed to the air, they mouldered into dust.* The following is a representation osthe Congregational church, situ ated in the central part of the town, and some osthe buildings in the vi cinity. The hill seen back of the church is sometimes denominated Mount Pisgah. The first settler in the town, Benjamin Horton, loca ted himself about three fourths of a mile south from this place, on the Norfolk road, in December, 1765; Joseph Rockwell came in January, 1766; Joseph Seymour and Nathan Bass, in the following April and May, and Samuel Rockwell in 1767. The common method of clear ing land was to girdle the timber; on the third year after girdling, it was sown with rye and seeded down to grass: the average crop\u00b0was * American Gazetteer."], [487, "465 CORNWALL.

The land thus partially cleared, pro duced good pasturage for 7 or 8 years, when the remaining timber on the land having principally fallen, it became necessary to clear it; be ing sallowed down, it produced good wheat and rye. When the land was new, it produced good oats and turnips. Apple trees, at the first settlement of the town, did not flourish. The town was organized into an ecclesiastical society in 1786, and the first meeting house was built about the same time. Rev. Dr. Jonathan Edwards, of New Haven, son of the celebrated divine of the same name, was installed the first pastor, in 1795. He however continued here but 3 or 4 years, being appointed President of Union College, in Schenectady. The Rev. Chauncey Lee, D. D. was the next minister. There are at present five houses of worship in the limits of the town, 1 Congregational, 2 Bap tist, 1 Methodist, and 1 for various denominations. CORNWALL. This township was laid out in fifty three allotments, and sold by the colony at Fairfield in 1738, at fifty pounds per right. The first per manent settlement was made about 1740, there being this year 13 fam ilies in the town. The first inhabitants were from various pans of the colony, the greatest number being from Plainfield. These were per sons by the name of Jewett, Spaulding, Barret, Squires, and others. Those by the name of Allen and Griffin, were from Litchfield ; the Fullers and Robertses from Colchester. There were other persons from Tolland, Norwalk, and some from Massachusetts. Such a num ber of persons planted themselves in the town at once, that they were able to support a minister from the commencement of the settlement, 59"], [488, "466 CORNWALL. In August, 1741, the Rev. Solomon Palmer was ordained their pastor. \" He continued with them in peace until March, 1754, when on the Sabbath, to the great surprise of the people, he declared himself an Episcopalian in sentiment. He soon after went to England, and ob tained orders. He was originally of Branford, and had his education at Yale College.\"* Northeastern view of iSouth Cornwall. Cornwall is situated 38 miles west from Hartford, and 48 northwest from New Haven ; bounded north by Canaan, west by the Housatonic, separating it from Sharon, east by Goshen, and south by Warren and Kent. Its average length from north to south is more than nine miles, and its breadth about five. The face of the township is hilly and mountainous, but the soil is fertile and productive, being well adapted both to grain and grazing. Several minerals have been discovered in this town ; in the western section, in what is called Mine Mountain, near the Housatonic, veins of black lead have been discovered in vari ous places; about two miles south of the principal settlement, a bed of porcelain clay has been discovered ; there are also various indica tions of iron ore. The above shows the appearance of the village of South Cornwall, as seen from the road which passes from Goshen to Sharon. The drawing was taken from the house of George Wheaton, Esq. on the elevated ground about one mile n. e. from the Congregational church. There are two mercantile stores, and about twenty dwelling bouses, within half a mile of the church. The appearance of this village and the surrounding objects, as seen from the road above mentioned, con stitutes one of the most interesting and striking scenes to be met with in the slate. The cheerful appearance of the church and the little * Dr. Trumbull."], [489, "467 GOSHEN. cluster of white painted buildings surrounding it, at the bottom of a deep valley, is uncommonly pleasing. The mountains and lofty hills which rise immediately on almost every side, shutting out in a sense the rest of the world from this apparently retired spot, present a bold and most striking feature in the landscape. The mountain seen south of the village is Colt's Foot Mountain, so called it is said from the circumstance of a colt's foot being found on its summit, which was probably carried there by some wild animal, as the mountain is almost inaccessible. This village is the place where the Foreign Mission School was established in 1818. The building in which the school was kept is the westernmost in the cluster seen around the church. This school had its rise from the attempt to qualify Obookiah, a pious Owyheean youth, and others, for missionaries to their native lands. Obookiah was brought to this country in 1808, and came to New Ha ven. While here, Samuel J. Mills, a student in Yale College, and other pious persons, commiserating his condition, instructed him in tbe Christian religion. Obookiah soon became hopefully pious, and strong ly advocated a mission to his countrymen. Other natives of his island were found, and a school was established for their benefit at Cornwall. In 1820, the number of pupils in this school was 29, of whom 19 were American Indians, and 6 from the islands osthe Pacific Ocean. Oboo kiah sickened and died in Cornwall in 1818. The following is the in scription on his monument in the village grave yard. In memory of Henry Obookiah, a native of Owyhee. His arrival in this country gave rise to the Foreign Mission School, of which he was a worthy member. He was once an Idolater, and was designed for a Pagan Priest; but by the grace of God, and by the prayers and inslructions of pious friends, he became a Christian. He was eminent for piety and missionary zeal. When almost prepared to return to his native isle to preach the Gospel, God took him to himself. In his last sickness, he wept and prayed for Owyhee, but was submissive. He died without fear, with a heavenly smile on his countenance and glory in his soul, Feb. 17th, 1818, aged 26. GOSHEN. The township of Goshen was sold at New Haven, in December, 1737, and its settlement commenced in one or two years afterwards. The first inhabitants were principally from New Haven, Wallingsord, and Farmington. It is stated lhat the houses of Gideon Thompson and John Beach, who were among the first settlers, were palisadoed in, for a defense against the Indians. Mr. Beach's house was situated on East street, about 2J miles from the present South Congregational church ; the house of Mr. Thompson, stood on West street, near a mile to the southwest. Goshen was incorporated as a town in 1749. It is bound ed n. by Norfolk, e. by Torrington and Winchester, w. by Cornwall, and s. by Litchfield; it is 9 miles in length and 4 J in breadth. The central part is 6 miles Irom Litchfield, 32 west from Hartford and 42 from New Haven. It is the most elevated township in the state, but not generally mountainous ; the surface being undulating, affording an in teresting diversity of hills and vales. The soil is a gravelly loam, deep,"], [490, "468 GOSHEN. strong and fertile, admirably adapted for grazing. This is one of the best towns for the dairy business in the state. Large quantities of cheese are annually made, the fame of which is widely and justly celebrated, and the inhabitants are generally in prosperous circumstances. In neat ness, in and about their dwellings, and in the appearance of general comfort and prosperity, they are not exceeded, if equalled, by any town in the state. South view of Goshen, (central part.) The above is a representation of the Congregational church and some other buildings in the central part of the town. The building seen on the right, with a small spire, is the Academy, where the higher branches of education are taught. The common district school-house is of brick, the first building seen in the engraving south of the church. The other Congregational church in the town, is four miles northeast from this. There was formerly an Episcopal church, situated about 2 miles to the northeast. About the time osthe American Revolution, the Episcopal society, becoming very much reduced in numbers, sold their house to the north Congregational society ; but while they were endeavoring to draw it towards their section osthe town, it was blown down by the wind. The first meeting house in the town was built of logs ; it stood about 80 rods below the church seen in the engraving. The elevated ground seen beyond the houses in the engraving, is called Ivy mountain. This is considered the most elevated point of land in the state. It affords a most extensive and interesting prospect, in almost every direction ; to the west is a view of the Catskill mountains for a considerable extent, their rugged features, and high and disorderly hills ; and to the east is a view of the elevated country east of Connecticut river. There is this rare and peculiar circumstance, with respect to what is called the East street, in Goshen; that the rain which falls on the front osthe houses, descends into the Housatonic river, and that which falls on the back"], [491, "469 H A R W I N T 0 N . side into the Waterbury river. About one mile and a half west from the central part, is a collection of several mills, and some manufacturing establishments, around which is collected a cluster of houses ; this place is called Canada village.* The Methodist church is built in this place. The stream which passes this village is fed from a large pond in the vi cinity, and is admirably calculated for water works, having an adequate supply of water, characterized by great uniformity, being neither affected by droughts nor heavy rains. The first minister in the town, was the Rev. Stephen Heaton. He was buried about a mile south of the Congregational church. His mon ument, with a few others, stands at present in an open field, near the Litchfield road ; the following is the inscription. In memory of the Rev. Stephen Heaton, V. D.

Harwinton originally consisted of two half townships, one part be longing to Hartford, and the other to the Windsor proprietors. The first settlers were also from Hartford and Windsor. The town is said to have derived its name from the names osthe towns Hartford, Wind sor, and Farmington, Har-ivin-ton. \" The six first settlers were Mes senger, Brace, Hopkins, Webster, Phelps and Wilson. These were on the lands before the division and sale of them in 1732. The set tlement of the town is considered as having been made in 1731. It was incorporated in October, 1737. The first minister was the Rev. Andrew Bartholomew, ordained about the year 1736.\" Harwinton is bounded n. by New Hartford and Torrington, w. by the Naugatuc river, separating it from Litchfield, e. by Burlington, and s. by Plymouth. It is 6 miles in length, and upwards of 5 in width. The township is elevated and hilly, with granite rocks. The lands are best adapted for grazing, and the making of butter and cheese is a leading agricultural interest. There is one house for public worship in the town, which is for Congregationalists. The central part of the town is 8 miles from Litchfield, 23 from Hartford, and 40 from New Haven. The number of inhabitants in 1810 was 1,718 ; in 1830, the number was reduced to 1,516. * This village is said to have derived its name in the following manner : A man by the name of Frisbie, who was the first miller in this place, was frequently saying from year to year, that he intended the next year to move to Canada, and still contin ued to stay where he was. The people finally agreed to bring Canada to him, by call ing the place where he lived by that name. t Pale death invades with the same step, the hovels of beggars and the palaces of kings. \u25a06"], [492, "470 KENT KENT. The tract now comprising the towns of Kent and Warren was sold at auction at the court house in Windham, in March, 1738. The settle ment commenced the same year. The town was laid out in fifty three shares. The principal settlers were from Colchester, Fairfield and Nor walk. Payne, Washburn, Wright, Ransom and Platt, were from Col chester ; the Comstocks were from Fairfield ; and the Slausons, Can fields and Bassetts, were from Norwalk. The town was incorporated, and vested with town privileges at the session of the Legislature in Oc tober, 1739. The first minister was the Rev. Cyrus Marsh, ordained in May, 1741. The settlement of the town was rapid. In May, when Mr. Marsh was ordained, the church consisted of ten males only ; but before the end of the year, there was an addition of fifty three persons, male and female, principally by recommendations from other churches. Northeast view of the Episcopal Church, Kent. Kent is characteristically mountainous; it is bounded n. by Sharon, e. by Warren, s. by New Milford, and w. by the state of New York. It is nearly 8 miles in length, and 6 in breadth from east to west. The manufacture of iron was formerly carried on to a considerable extent in this town ; there are at present three furnaces in operation. There are 3 houses of worship in the town ; 1 Episcopal, 1 Congregational, and 1 Methodist. The above is a representation of the Episcopal church in Kent, 50 miles from Hartford, and the same distance from New Haven. The Housatonic river passes at the foot of the mountain seen in the back ground. About a mile and a half below this building, on the opposite side osthe river, the Moravian church or mission house was standing 30 or 40 years since, near the house of Mr. Raymond, which is just dis cernible in the distance on the extreme left. The Moravians left this"], [493, "471 KENT place about half a century since. The Scatacook tribe, for whose bene fit this mission was established, occupied the interval on the west side of the river for about three miles. The scenery in this place has a pecu liar charm, being uncommonly beautiful and interesting. The river, calm and still, winds with grace and beauty through this fertile spot, while the mountain rises abruptly, high, rugged and precipitous, forming a back ground and finish to the picture. During the Revolutionary war this tribe furnished 100 warriors. It is said that they were able to com municate intelligence from the sea coast to Stockbridge, Mass, the dis tance of 100 miles, in two hours. This was effected by Indian yells, or whoops, from their men, who were stationed at proper places along the borders osthe Housatonic, from its mouth up to Stockbridge. Dr. Dwight, who passed through this place in 1798, says that there were sixteen wigwams remaining. Gideon Mauwehu, the king or sachem of the Scatacook tribe, was a Pequot Indian. The last place of his residence, previous to his coming to Kent, was in the town of Dover, N. Y. on Ten mile river, a few miles west of Scatacook. Mauwehu, in one of his hunting ex cursions, came to the summit of the mountain which rises almost pre cipitously west of Scatacook, and beholding the beautiful valley and river below, determined to make it the place of his future residence. It was indeed a lovely and desirable place ; there were several hun dred acres of excellent land, covered with grass like a prairie, with some few scattering trees interspersed. The river was well supplied with fish, and on the mountains, on both sides, was found an abundance of deer, and other wild game. At this place Mauwehu collected the Indians, and became their sachem, and here the Moravians had a flour ishing mission. A granddaughter osthe sachem, Eunice Mauwehu, and two or three families, are all that now (1836) remain of the tribe at Scatacook. The place where Mauwehu resided was sold by the state for about 3,000 dollars, the interest of which is annually appropriated for their benefit. This farm has been recently sold by Mr. Raymond for 18,000 dollars. The tribe still possesses about 300 acres of land, lying south of this farm ; the greater part of which, however, lies on the mountain west of the valley, and is valued from 1,500 to 2,000 dollars. \" There is in this town, (says Dr. Trumbull,) convincing evidence, that it was a grand seat of the native inhabitants of this country, before Indians, who more lately inhabited it, had any residence in it. There are arrow heads, stone pots, and a sort of knives, and various kinds of utensils, frequently found by the English, ofsuch curious workmanship, as exceeds all the skill of any Indians since the English came into this country, and became acquainted with them. These were not only found when ihe town was first settled, but they are still found on the sides of Housatonic river. The history of the Indians in the town when the settlement of it commenced, is well known. Mowehue, a sachem, who a few years before had removed with his Indians from New town to New Milford, about the year 1728 built him a hunting house at Scatacook, in the northwest part of Kent, on the west bank of the Housatonic river. He invited the Indians at New Milford, from the Oblong, in the province of New York, and from various other places, to settle with him at Scatacook; and it appears that he was a man of so much art and popularity among the Indians, that in about ten or eleven years, about the lime when the town was settled, he could muster an hundred war riors. The whole number, probably, was about five or six hundred. These, like the other Indians in this state, and in most other states, have been greatly diminished."], [494, "472 NEW HARTFORD. Their whole number, at this time, is not more than forty. The Moravian missiona ries visited these Indians about the time of the great religious concern in this country. They came first in the year 1740, and visited the Indian village called Chekameka, in the Oblong, in the province of New York. They, about the same time, came and preached to the Scatacook Indians, and in 1743, according to their account, the Scata cook sachem was baptized by them. In this place they formed a church, and had a flourishing congregation. They baptized 150 of the Kent Indians. It is universally testified, that these missionaries were very inoffensive people ; that they were well es teemed and kindly treated by the people osthe town while they tarried. They, how ever, complain ofthemselves as ill treated, persecuted and imprisoned; but it could not be by the people of Connecticut. What became of (he Indians who were first on the ground, before the English had any settlements there is not known. When they mov ed away, or to what place, cannot be ascertained. The probability however is, that they were connected with Philip's Indians in the war against New England ; and that in the slaughter which the Connecticut troops made of the Indians on the Housatonic, at the close of that war, numbers of them were slain, and that the rest were so alarm ed, that they removed into Canada, as many other Indians did about the same time.\" NEW HARTFORD. The township of New Hartford was granted to the Hartford paten tees. The settlement commenced about the year 1733, and it appears to have been incorporated soon after. The first settlers were from Hartford. Their names were John, Cyprian and Zachariah Watson; Joseph Gillet, Noah Merril, deacon Martin Smith, Thomas Olcott, Stephen Kelsey, Matthew Gillet, John Andrus, Jonathan Marsh, Dan iel Shepherd, Samuel Douglass, Eleazar Goodwin, and others. The first minister in the town was the Rev. Jonathan Marsh, son of the Rev. Jonathan Marsh of Windsor, ordained October, 1739. He con tinued in the ministry between fifty four and fifty five years. As this was a frontier town, some fortifications were erected for the defense of the inhabitants.* New Hartford is 20 miles northwest from Hartford. It is bounded north by Barkhamsted, east by Canton, west by Torrington, and south by Burlington and Harwinton. It is six miles in length, and averages about the same distance in breadth. The township is hilly and moun tainous, containing a range of mountains of considerable elevation, con sisting of granite and other primitive formations. In the northern part of the town, the perennial or evergreen region of Connecticut commences. Here several years since was an exten sive tract of forests, called \" Green Woods,\" but they are now reduced, roads having been opened through them, and considerable portions cleared. The Farmington river passes through the northeastern sec tion of the town, affording good sites for mills, &c. The town is also watered by numerous small streams, running in various directions. The lands are best adapted for grazing. The following engraving shows the appearance of the village, as it is entered from the north, upon the Albany road. It consists of about 30 dwelling houses, 1 cotton factory, 1 machine shop, and 4 mercantile stores. The village is mostly on the west side of the Farmington river, * Dr. Trumbull."], [495, "NEW HARTFORD. 473 Northern view of New Hartford, (North village.) situated in a deep valley, the hills and mountains rising immediately on every side, excepting the valley through which the river and turnpike passes. The Congregational church is seen on the extreme right of the engraving. The mountain is sometimes called Bare Spot Mountain, from the circumstance of a bare spot, destitute of trees and shrubbery, being found on its summit. This village is about 2J miles north osthe old Congregational church and town house, 20 miles from Hartford, 16 from Litchfield, 45 from New Haven, and 75 from Albany. About three fourths of a mile to the southeast is another village, about the size of the one described, which has been built up in the course of five or six years past, called Kellogg, or lower village ; it has a woolen factory, and an establishment for manufacturing machinery for making woolen cloth. Besides the two Congregational churches, there is one for the Baptist denomination, situated in the southwest part of the town. In the eastern part of this town there is a rough and mountainous district, formerly designated Satan's Kingdom, and the few inhabitants who lived here were in a meas ure shut out from the rest of mankind. An inhabitant of the town invited one of his neighbors, who lived within the limits of this district, to go and hear Mr. Marsh, the first minister who was settled in the town. He was prevailed upon to go to church in the forenoon. In the course of his prayer, Mr. Marsh, among other things, prayed that Satan's kingd.om might be destroyed. It appears that the inhabitant of Uiis dis trict, took the expression in a literal and tangible sense, having probably never heard the expression used but in reference to the district wherein he resided. Being asked to go to meeting in the afternoon, he refused, slating that Mr. Marsh had insulted him ; \" for blast him,\" said he, \" when he prayed for the destruction of Satan's kingdom, he very well knew all my interests lay there.\" The following are extracts from the town records At a town meeting, Dec. 19th 1738. \u2014 Committee appointed to make application to x<fi.r.

NEW MILFORD New Milford, the largest town in territorial extent in Connecticut, is in the southwestern extremity of the county. It is bounded n. by Kent, e. by Washington, Roxbury and Southbury, s. by Newtown and Brookfield, and w. by New Fairfield and Sherman. It has an average length of 13 miles, and an average breadth of 6J miles, comprising an area of 84 square miles. The township is hilly and broken, several mountainous ridges extending through it. \" The soil is much diversi fied, and where susceptible of cultivation, it is generally good; but on the whole more distinguished for grain than grass. There are, however, large quantities of excellent meadow ground, but the pasturage is, on the whole, not abundant. It is essentially a farming town. Large quantities of grain are annually raised. The township is centrally in tersected by the Housatonic: two branches of the Ashpetuck, Rocky and Still rivers, with other streams, enter the Housatonic in this town, affording numerous excellent mill seats. On Second hill, in the eastern part of the town, from two to three miles from the central village, are inexhaustible quantities of granite of a superior quality. There are also a number of extensive marble quarries in the town. The hatting bu siness is carried on to some extent in Bridge water society. There are 9 houses of worship in the town, 2 Congregational, 2 Episcopal, 2 Bap tist, 2 Methodist, and 1 for Friends or Quakers. The following ancient history of the town of New Milford, is ex tracted from Rev. Stanley Griswold's sermon, delivered at New Mil ford, January 7th, 1801, which was by a vote of the town entered on their records. For these extracts, with some additional notes and other valuable information, the author is indebted to the Hon. David S. Boardman, of New Milford. \" The town of New Milford was purchased of the colony of Con necticut, by a company of individuals, chiefly belonging to Milford, in this state : hence the name it received, New Milford. \u00b0This purchase"], [497, "475 NEW MILFORD. was made in the year 1703, about 98 years ago.* Afterwards an ad ditional purchase was made, which forms the northern extremity of the town, and was called the north purchase. This was made in the year 1722. This town is now, I believe, the largest in territorial limits of any town in the state, and formerly was somewhat longer than it is at present. A part of it was set off on the south end, west of the river, to help form the town of Brookfield. Another part was set off on the northeast corner, to help form the town of Washington. Still, as it now remains, the longest right line through it from northeast to southwest is not far from 20 miles. f \" The first settlement that was made in this town by civilized peo ple, was in the year 1707 ; so that New Milford has now been settled about 93 years. At that time a considerable number of the natives inhabited here, of whom there were reckoned about 200 warriors. They dwelt chiefly along the intervale by the river, a part of which intervale is to this day called Indian Field ;| and several of their bu rial grounds are yet to be seen in various parts of the town. Their graves are of a circular form, and the persons were buried sitting up, as in a natural position, on the ground. For some time after the white people came here, an Indian chief or sachem, named Werauhamaug, \\\\ had a palace standing near the Great falls, where he resided. On the inner walls of this palace, (which were of bark with the smooth side inwards,) were pictured every known species of beast, bird, fish and insect, from the largest down to the smallest. This was said to have been done by artists whom a friendly prince at a great distance sent to him for that purpose, as Hiram to Solomon. In this palace, the fore mentioned chief was visited by the Rev. Mr. Boardman, first minister of this town, during his last sickness, and at his death. Mr. Boardman has left in manuscript, a minute and circumstantial account of his labors with the sachem to enlighten him in right Christian doctrines, as also the singular, rude, and abusive behavior osthe other natives on the oc- * This tract was called Weantinogue. The original purchasers and proprietors were 109 in number, 99 of whom were purchasers of whole rights, and 10 of half rights: 24 shillings was the purchase of a whole, and 12 shillings of a half right. No individual had originally more than one right. The first division of land was granted in December, 1706, and was a home lot of 7 and a half acres and 10 acres for pasture. The 2d division was in May, 1712, of two lots of 40 acres each upon a right; ten olher divisions were granted before 1760. New Milford first sent representatives to the General Assembly in 1725. It was the second town settled in ihe county. Woodbury was the first. t About 18 miles. t On the west bank of the river, opposite the village. II He was so considerable a personage as to have reserved, as his hunting ground, a considerable part of the present society of New Preston, which always, until the in corporation of the town of Washington, of which it is a part, was called Raumaug, after the original proprietor, dropping for convenience sake, the prefix we. I have often seen the grave of this chief in the Indian burying ground, at no great distance from his place of residence ; distinguished, however, only by its more ample dimen sions, from the surrounding graves, out of many of which large trees are now growing. There is a similar burying ground on the west side of the river, opposite to and in si\"ht of our village, (New Milford,) on the bluff, bounding the Indian field, so called, and contiguous to Fort Hill, the site of the last Indian fortress known to have existed in this town."], [498, "476 N F. W MILFORD. casion ; from whence it appears that few or none of those people, (the sachem excepted,) were disposed at that time to embrace Christianity: and so far as those people in this town and its neighborhood were ever converted to the Christian religion, it was a considerable time after wards, by the Moravian missionaries. Count Zinzendors himself came to this town and preached here. After the conversion of the natives by the Moravians, they quitted their settlements here on religious ac counts, and removed to Bethlem, in Pennsylvania, where the brethren of that communion chiefly resided. But finding it very unhealthy for them there, and a large number dying, the remnant removed back again, where they have lived and gradually dwindled ever since.* The natives had sundry fortresses, or military stations, in and about this town, to guard against attacks from distant tribes. Some spots in the town bear an allusion to them to this day, as Fort Hill, Guarding Mountains ey-c. \" It has been said that all the tribes along by this river, from its source to the sea, were in strict alliance and friendship ; and that by means of certain sounds made on their guarding heights, an alarm might be spread in the space of three hours, through the whole line of tribes, a distance of near 200 miles. The natives were generally very friendly, and serviceable to the first settlers of this town, by defending them from hostile attacks, and by supplying them with such provisions as they could furnish. They had several reserves of land made for Iheir accommodation in and about ihe town, as lor a considerable time the Indian field, so called, the place once called Rau maug, (from the name of the sachem before mentioned,) now in the parish of New Preston ; the Great Falls, which they reserved for the fishing of lampreys ; and lastly, the place where they now reside, called Scatacook. The two former they sold many years since, the two latter they still own. But their number has ever been diminish ing since the neighborhood of the white people, and at this time they are reduced to a mere handful. So much for the natives. \" The first white settler who came to this towTn was John Noble, from Westfield, state of Massachusetts, who came here in the year 1707. He brought with him at first one of his daughters, then about eight years old. He first built him a hut under what is called Fort hill, but afterwards removed and pitched here, in the present center of the town. His house here was for some time the last house on this side of Albany, and Gen. Nicholson once lodged in it, in the wars un der the reign of Queen Anne. It deserves to be mentioned, to the credit osthe natives, that Mr. Noble once left his little daughter here, 8 years old, alone with them, for the space of three or four weeks, while he was necessarily absent from the town, and on his return he found she had been well treated, and taken exceedingly good care of. * When the Indians returned from Pennsylvania, as mentioned by Mr. Griswold, few of them took up their permanent residence in this town. They joined the Scata cook tribe, but used for a long time in the season of fishing, annually to revisit their fishing ground at the Great Falls, two and a half miles below ihe village, for the pur pose ot taking lampreys, their favorite fish, which are not found above these falls. This siand they never would part with, and, though occupied by the whites also for the same purpose, the Indians' rights were always recognized, and even to this day when a straggler comes there, the whites allow them iheir turn. The Scatacook tribe are not quite extinct, and the few who remain, are under the care of an overseer ap pointed by the state, and who annually reports the state of their affairs to the county court of this coumy. Scatacook is situated in the town of Kent, and the account of it belongs to that town, and not to New Milford ; and I only add this note to guard against a possible misconception of Mr. G.'s meaning in the place noted. t On ihe bluff adjoining the mountain back osthe Indian field."], [499, "477 NEW MILFORD. \" It is impossible at this distance of lime to ascertain the exact order in which the subsequent settlers came to this lown, or the identical years in which they came. It is presumed, however, that we have obtained by diligent search and enquiry of the aged, somewhere near the order of their coming, as also the places from whence they came. We shall first mention the names of those who came more than 60 years ago, (whom we may consider the first settlers,) together with the places whence they emi grated, setting them down in the order in which it is supposed they came, viz. John Noble, Westfield; John Bostwick, Stratford ; Zechariah Ferriss, Stratford; Samuel Hitchcock, Springfield, Mass.; Samuel Brownson, Farmington ; Roger Brownson, Farminglon ; John Weller, Springfield ; Jeremiah Canfield, Milford ; Daniel Board man, Wethersfield; Samuel Camp, Milford; Theophilus Baldwin, Milford; Ebene zer Baldwin, Milford ; William Gaylord, Windsor ; James Hine, Milford; Daniel Hine, Milford; Joseph Warner, Hadley, Mass.; John Warner, Hadley, Mass.; James Prime, Milford; John Welch, Milford; Paul Welch, Milford; Thomas Pickell, Danbury; Jonathan Buck, Wethersfield ; Enoch Buck, Wethersfield ; Eze kiel Buck, Wethersfield; Henry Garlick, England; Eleazer Beecher, Milford; Joseph Ruggles, New Haven ; Nathan Collins, Milford ; Joseph Collins, Milford ; Amos Collins, Milford; Ezekiel Paine, Rhode Island; Samuel Peel, Stratford; John Peet, Stratford; Thaddeus Peet, Stratford; Thomas Oviatt, Milford; Gamaliel Terrill, Milford; Nathan Terrill, Milford; Job Terrill, Milford; James Terrill, Milford ; Caleb Terrill, Milford ; Joseph Murray, Westchesler, N. Y. ; Josiah Smith, Danbury. [A long list follows, but it will be quite useless to pursue it.] \" The first white male child born in this town was the late Lieut. Daniel Bostwick ;* and the first female was Mrs. Sarah Noble, for merly Ferris, now living. And it is worthy of remark, that three per sons have lived in this town to be more than 100 years of age, two of whom are now living. \" The early part osthe settlement here was somewhat retarded by a tedious lawsuit, regarding the title to a considerable tract in the center of the town. Col. John Read claimed it, under a title from the natives, and removed here to gain a residence and defend his title. This dis couraged settlers under the company's title from coming on, and but a small number came the few first years. These few, like all other first settlers, saw troublous times ; and their names are worthy the af fectionate remembrance and praise of their posterity. It was common for them to carry their fire arms into the field to labor, and they were obliged to provide a fortified house to resort to in time of danger ; and they were sometimes reduced to distress, through the failure of provis ions and the difficulty of supplying themselves. \" The town plot or center was first laid out on the hill next east of the present center, whence that hill is to this day called Town Hill. Afterwards it was concluded to remove the center to the top osthe hill next north of the present center, for which the first minister built and lived on that hill. But ultimately it was thought more convenient to place the center where it now is. \" New Milford for a considerable time belonged to the County of New Haven ; but after Litchfield County was erected, it was set off to the latter. It is ascertained from the papers osthe first minister, lhat in the year 1712, there were but 12 families in this town. Col. John Read, who is mentioned before as having been once a candidate for the ministry, preached the first sermon that ever was preached here. After he left the place, his house, which stood near where the present town house stands, was used as a place of worship for some years. The first meeting house was built in the year 1720. It stood near ihe foot osthe hill, a few rods to the northeast osthe present lown house. There the first minister, Mr. Boardman, officiated during his life ; and the second minister, Mr. Taylor during some of the first years of his ministry. It is * This Daniel Bostwick was the youngest son of John Bostwick, ihe second settler who came here."], [500, "478 NEW MILFORD. said by the aged that when they first began to meet in that house, though it was small, yet every person in the town could sit around upon the outer sills, side by side. \" The house in which we are now assembled, being the second meeting house, was built in the year 1754, about 47 years ago. The first Episcopal church was built in the year 1746; the second, which is the one now standing, began to be built 1765, was raised in 1766, about 35 years ago. It was finished and consecrated 1793. The Strict Congregationalists, usually'called Separates, erected their house of worship in the year 1761, 40 years ago, which is now standing. The Friends, commonly called Quakers, built their meeting house not far from the year 1742, now standing, though in another place than where it was first set. Another communion of Friends, follow ers of Jemima Wilkinson, built a house of worship in the north end of the town about 15 or 20 years ago, but it is now owned and occupied by the Episcopalians of New Preston. The Baptists erected a house of worship in the south end of ihe town, called the Neck, (now Bridgewaler society,) about 11 or 12 years ago; but it is sold and now used for another purpose. \" This naturally leads us lo consider more particularly the several Christian persua sions, denominations or societies, contained in this town. The eldest here is the Pres byterian, or more properly the Congregationalists. Most or all of the earliest settlers wereofthat denomination. This society may therefore be considered as old as the town ; but the professing members were not gathered into a church until the year 1716. It then consisted of 8 men and 5 women. There have been three ministers ordained in this societv. The first was the Rev. Daniel Boardman from Wethersfield. He came into this town first to preach as a candidate, in the year 1712. He was ordained on the 21st Nov. 1716. He died Aug. 25th, 1744, in the 58th year of his age, having served here 27 years and 9 months. It appears from his records, that he baptized 521 persons, and married 67 couple. \u2014 The second minister was the Rev. Nathaniel Taylor from Danbury. He came first to preach as a candidate in January, 1748: was or dained the 29th day of June following. He died Dec. 9th, 1800, aged 78 years and 3 months, having been ordained 52 years and 5 months. According to his record, he baptized 927 persons, and married 349 couple. \u2014 Myself, who am the third minister, came first to preach as a candidate June 14th, 1789 : was ordained colleague pastor with the Rev. Mr. Taylor on the 20th day ofjanuary, 1790. I have baptized 232 per sons, and married 103 couple. Many have been married by the civil authority, whose number I have not ascertained. \" The next religious society in the order of time is the Friends, usually called Qua kers. Their origin in this town was about the year 1731. Then 19 church members left the Presbyterian communion, and set up that society. About 10 years afterwards, they built their house of worship, which was set on a piece of ground which was given for that purpose, and also for the purpose of a burying place, by Zechariah Ferris, op posite the dwelling house of Mr. David Ferris. Since that lime it has been removed to the place where it now stands, for the greater accommodation of the members ; where they now hold their regular meetings, though the number is but small. \" The next religions society in ihe order of time is the Episcopalian. Some individ uals of that profession came into this town at an earlier period, but no slated worship was held here till somewhere between the years 1740 and 1745. Worship was then carried on here by the Rev. Mr. Beach of Newtown. One Mr. Barzillai Dean read service here for several years, then went to England for orders, with a view to settle here on his return, but died on his passage. \u2014 The first Episcopal minister who came and resided in this town, was the Rev. Solomon Palmer from Cornwall. He came in the year 1754, and removed to Litchfield about the year 1760 ; was minister here about six years. \u2014 The second was the Rev. Thomas Davis from Washington. He came here about the year 1761, and died in this town May 12th, 1766, in the 30th year of his. age, and the sixth of his ministry. \"The third Episcopal minister was the Rev. Richard Clark from Milford. He was settled here in June, 1767, and left the town in 1787. The society was then vacant for a few years. The fourth Episcopal minister was the Rev. Truman Marsh from Litchfield. He was settled here in November, 1790, and left the town 9th of Nov. 1799, and removed to Litchfield. He was minister here just 9 years. Since then the society has been vacant.\u2014 The next religious society in the order of time, is the Strict Congregationahst, commonly called Separates. This sprung out of the other societies in consequence of what is called the great revival of religion, or by others the New Light time, between the years 1740 and 1750. Their first elder who preached statedly here, though he never was ordained over them, was Mr. Elihu Marsh. Their second was Mr. Robert Campbell, who was the first that was ordained over them He was ordained here 29 years ago, continued about 12 years, and was then dismissed and left the town. Their third elder was Mr. Barnabus Lathrop, who came here about 10 years ago, and preached to them about two years. He afterwards joined the Presby terian society, and died in this town April 10th, 1796, aged 57 years. Their fourth"], [501, "NEW MILFORD. 479 and now officiating elder, is Mr. Daniel Hine. He has been ordained over them 4 ?I?oS' if soclety continued to maintain a separate worship till about the year 1812, when having become very small, the members, on the recommendation (as it is understood) of elder Hine, dissolved the sociely, and the principal part of them joined either the Presbyterian society or the Baptists.]\u2014 The nexi religious denomination that may be mentioned are the Baptists. It is but quite lately that communion as sumed the appearance of a regular society here. A small church was formed, and a house of worship built in the lower end of the town, called the Neck, [now Bridge w-aler society,] about 11 or 12 years ago; but they never had an elder settled over them, and within a few years past they sold their house and chiefly removed out of the town. A few scattered individuals remain, but no stated worship is performed. South view of New Milford, (central part.) \" The last denomination we shall mention is one which is now extinct from the town, but not many years since existed in some numbers. They are the Friends, called Je mimailes, gathered here by one Jemima Wilkinson. Between 15 and 20 years ago, a number of families in the northeastern part of the town, joined in that communion, and built a house of worship; but shortly afterwards they sold their house and private estates, and moved away in a body with their leader, into the western part osthe state of New York, called the Genesee, in Ontario County. Their settlement was on or near the western shore of the Geneva Lake, about 20 miles south of the town of Ge neva, where, though occasionally abandoned by some of her followers, Jemima con tinued for many years to maintain her ascendancy over her remaining followers, and even it is said until her death, since which nothing has here been heard of them, and it is supposed that the society as such has become extinct. \u2014 A few individuals of other persuasions have been or still are in the town, such as Seventh Day Baptists, Scotch Presbyterians, Glassites and Methodists, but no society of these has been formed. \"Thus have I endeavored to sketch something of the ecclesiastical history of the town.\" [Here follows what the preacher styles the civil and military history of the lown, but containing nothing peculiar, and consisting principally of the names of the civil and military officers of the town, in chronological order, this part of the extract is omitted in this copy.] \"The first bridge that was ever built over the Housatonic river from the sea to its source, was built in this town, and was finished in July, 1737. The first school that was set up in this town, was in the year 1721 : it was to be kept four months in the year, and the town to pay one half of the expense. At this time there are 22 school districts in this town, exclusive of those in the parish of New Preston ; and it is computed that about 700 children attend in them through the winter season.\""], [502, "480 NEW MILFORD. The village of New Milford consists of about 60 dwelling houses and 5 mercantile stores. The engraving shows the appearance of the cen tral street, as it is seen from the south end. It is wide, and about 60 rods in length. The building which is seen on the right is the ancient Episcopal church, which was taken down the present year, and a new church is now erecting. The Congregational church, erected in 1833, is seen to the north : the old church stood in the street, about 30 rods southerly from the one seen in the engraving. This place is 18 miles s. w. of Litchfield, 36 n. w. from New Haven, and 4S from Hartford. From the Connecticut Journal, March Wth, 1768. We hear from New Milford, that a manufactory has lately been opened there, wherein were wrought, or rather imitated, New York 40s. bills of currency, and Span ish milled dollars, to a great degree of imperfection; but that, notwithstanding the present prevailing scarcity of money, and loud call for industry, it is thought that branch of business may prove prejudicial to the public, and therefore ihe artificers already labor under great discouragements from every quarter, and near one dozen of them embarrassed with a close confinement in a distant cage, where a bill is pre pared upon some obvious specimens of their ingenuity, to assert their title to the Royal Bounty.

The Riflemen on their way from the southern colonies through the country, admin ister the new fashioned discipline of tar and feathers to the obstinate and refractory to ries that they meet on their road, which has had a very good effect here. Those whose crimes are of a more atrocious nature, they punish by sending them to General Gage. They took a man in this town, a most incorrigible tory, who called them d \u2014 d rebels, &c, and made him walk before them to Litchfield, which is 20 miles, and carry one of his own geese all the way in his hand: when they arrived there, they tarred him, and made him pluck his goose, and then bestowed the feathers on him, drummed him out of the company, and obliged him to kneel down and thank them for their lenity. The following inscriptions are from monuments in the grave yard in the central village. In memory of the Rev.

Norfolk is an elevated township, the cenlrai part of which is 35 miles northwest from Hartford ; bounded north by ihe Massachusetts line, west by Canaan, east by Colebrook and Winchester, and south by Goshen. It is nine miles in length from north to south, and four and a half in breadth. \"The settlement of Norfolk began in 1744. This township, and several of the adjacent ones, were owned by the then colony of Con necticut ; and they were severally sold at public vendue at Middle towu, in 1742. Timothy Horssord os Windsor took a deed of one right of 400 acres, which he retained. All the other proprietors re linquished their rights, and forfeited their first payment, which was 40 shillings on a right. The town was originally laid out in 53 rights, of which one was reserved for a parsonage, one for the benefit of schools, and one for the first minister. Timothy Horssord sold his right to Titus Brown, who afterwards removed to this town and died here.\" The names of the first settlers were Titus and Cornelius Brown, from Windsor ; John Turner and Jedediah Richards, from Hartford. They lived on Brown's right. They were pious and exemplary families, and attended public worship in Canaan. In 1754, Norfolk was sold at public vendue at Middletown, the second time, excepting Brown's right. Soon a/ier, a number of fami lies moved into the town, and the settlement made considerable pro gress. The town was incorporated in 1758; at this time there were 27 families. In 1761, the Rev. Ammi R. Robbins was ordained as the first minister. At the time of his settlement the number of fami lies in the place had increased to sixty. From this time there was a gradual increase of inhabitants, till about the year 1800, when the number of families had increased to about two hundred and ninety, comprising a population of 1,649. Since this period the spirit of emi gration to the west has retarded and reduced the population. In 1810, the population was 1,441 ; in 1830, the population was 1,485, being an increase of 44 in twenty years. This town is elevated and mountainous. The soil is a primitive gravelly loam, generally cold and siony, but has considerable depth, and affords good grazing. Formerly large quantities of sugar were made from the maple : more than 20,000 lbs. have been manufactured in a single season ; but since the land has been cleared by progressive settlements, and in consequence of the destruction of the maple trees by some tornadoes, the business has greatly declined. The dairy busi- 61"], [504, "482 NORFOLK. ness comprises the principal interests of the town. A stream, called Blackberry river, runs near the center of the place, and a little west ward of the Congregational church falls over a ledge of rocks 30 feet in height. This is an excellent site for mills, of which there are sev eral near this spot. East view of Norfolk, (central part.) The above is a representation of the Congregational church, and most osthe buildings in the immediate vicinity. This little village has a small open square, or green, in front of the church, and is uncom monly neat and beautiful in its general appearance. About half a mile north is another village, in which are 2 woolen and 3 sytbe factories. There are, perhaps, in both places, about 30 dwelling houses, and four or five mercantile stores. The central part is 35 miles from Hartford, 17 from Litchfield, 42 from Hudson, and 60 from Albany. Litchfield, December 5, 1786. {No. 998.)

The whole of this formidable body, well armed, moved in a circular form, lo an adjacent mountain, the supposed retreat of these carnivorous unwelcome guesis, and having by this judi cious movement had the good luck to surround them, the whole were made prisoners; three surrendered at discretion; the other, having broken through their ranks, was shot in making his escape. The whole party then retired to an inn, and spent the day in joy and festivity. The coldness of the weather at the northward, must certainly have compelled these createres to take shelter in our woods.

He was humble, yet zealous ; peaceable, yet bold, in his master's cause. In the duties of his office, he was sincere, tender, and affectionate. His doctrine, and his life reflected credit on each other. And in his death, he strikingly exemplified that resignation to the divine will, which he steadily preached to others. When called for, he said, \" let me go and receive mercy.\" He died on the 31st day of October, 1813, aged 73. PLYMOUTH. Plymouth became an independent society in the town of Waterbury, in 1739, by the name of Northbury. At this time Westbury belonged to this society, but was afterwards incorporated as a distinct society, re taining its name. Afterwards both of these societies were incorporated as towns. Northbury was incorporated as a town, by the name of Ply mouth, in 1795. East view of the central part of Plymouth. It is bounded n. by Harwinton and Litchfield, e. by Bristol, w. by Watertown, and s. by Waterbury and Wolcott. Its average length from north to south is 5i miles ; its breadth nearly 5. The township is quite uneven and hilly ; the soil is a gravelly loam, abounding with primitive or granite rocks. The town is watered by the Naugatuc, which passes through its western section from north to south, and is a fine mill stream. The manufacture of clocks is an important branch of business in this town there bein^ seven clock factories, two of which are very extensive.

The road seen in the engraving is the Hartford turn pike ; it passes the Congregational church, and descends for nearly a mile into a deep valley, extending from north to south about one mile and a half: this place is called Plymouth Hollow. Here is a flourish ing little village, containing 1 cotton and 3 clock factories. The clock factories belonging to Mr. Terry and Mr. Thomas are extensive. The manufacture of small wooden clocks, it is believed, first originated with Mr. Terry, about twenty years ago ; since this period, the manufacture of this kind of clocks has been widely extended, and forms a very im portant branch of manufactures in this part of the state. In Ihe south part of this town, near the Naugatuc river, lived Mr. John Sutliff, a respectable miller, who died perhaps 10 or 12 years since. Mr. Sutliff, when a young man, became possessed with the idea, that by digging into the mountain near his house he should be able to find silver, gold, and other precious metals. He expected to find the silver and gold in a stale of fusion, so that he could dip it up with a ladle. He commenced digging by the Waterbury road, near the Watertown turnpike. In digging into the mountain, in order to avoid the rocks, slones and other obstructions, his course became very circuitous, and while digging as he supposed into the moun tain, he in fact got round under the turnpike road. This was found to be Ihe case in the following manner. Some person traveling on the road, hearing a noise under ground, beneath his feet, conjectured lhat it must be Sutliff digging. Having obtained assistance, he accordingly dug down and found Mr. Sulliff, who was quite angry in being interrupted in this manner. Although perfectly sane on all other subjects, he continued digging a little almost every day for the greater part of his life, for a period of perhaps 30 or 40 years, till the infirmities of old age compelled him to desist. Dr. Sylvanus Fansher, a native of this town, and now a resident of Southbury, has devoted nearly forty years of his life to the extension of the vaccine or kine pock inoculation, as a remedy against that scourge of the human race, the small pox. For his discoveries in expediting the kine pock, he has recently received a diploma from the \"Royal Jennerian Society of London.\" About the year 1802, when the kine pock had become apparently extinct in this country, it was found that a number of persons in Danbury and Goshen had taken the infection or virus, from milking cows. Dr. Fansher states, that he took the virus from the pustule on the milk maid's hand, and inoculated an in fant with it, and it proved to be the genuine kine pock. Dr. F. also states, that he has known several instances where the infection has been taken, without any apparent connection with the cow; and it is his be lies, that the infection is taken from some shrub or plant, from which, when discovered, we shall know something of the origin of the small pox, and have a sovereign remedy against it, at hand. Besides Danbury and Goshen, the genuine kine pock, or cow-pock, has been found ex isting in Plymouth, Newtown, Southbury, Oxford, Woodbury, Meri den, Middletown and New Hartford. ROXBURY. Roxbury was originally a part of Woodbury, and was incorporated in 1801. It is bounded n. by Washington, e. by Woodbury, s. by Southbury, and w. by New Milford. It is about six miles and a half in length from north to south, and nearly four in breadth. The town-"], [507, "485 ROXBURY. ship is diversified with hills and valleys. The soil is a gravelly loam, interspersed with some small tracts of sandy loam. The lands are well adapted to grazing, but afford considerable grain. The town is watered on its western border by the Shepaug, a considerable branch of the Hou satonic. About two miles northwest osthe center of the town, in Mine hill, a silver mine was wrought to some extent before the Revolution ary war, by some foreign miners. A shaft was sunk to a considerable depth. In digging for silver, a species of iron ore, called \" steel ore,\" was discovered. Northeastern view of Roxbury, (central part.) The above is an eastern view osthe central part of Roxbury, which is 32 miles northwest from New Haven, 46 from Hartford, and 15 from Litchfield. The Congregational church is seen on the right; the Episcopal church is seen farther westward, in the center of the engra ving. It appears that some of the first settlers were three families by the name of Baker, who located themselves about half a mile above the Episcopal church. About 2J miles below the church, a family by the name of Castle were the first settlers. The first meeting house was built about one mile south of the present churches. Col. Seth Warner, distinguished for his military services in the Amer ican army which captured Burgoyne, was a native of this town. Hon. Nathan Smith, a Senator of Congress from this state, Gen. Ephraim Hinman, distinguished for his humor and originality of character, and Royal R. Hinman, Esq. the present secretary of this state, were all residents of this town. Secretary Hinman is the author and compiler of a work, consisting of letters from the kings and queens of England, with answers thereto ; with other ancient and curious documents ; a valuable publication, compiled from the ancient files in the department of state; and it is hoped that this laudable example will be followed in other states."], [508, "486 SALISBURY. The following is copied from a monument in a grave yard north of the Episcopal church : In memory of Lieut. Thomas Weller, an officer in the United States army, who was murdered by Archibald W. Knapp, May 16th, 1814, aged 25 years and 9 mo. son of Thomas and Polly Weller. The circumstances respecting the death of Lieut. Weller, appear to be these. In the last war with Great Britain, Knapp enlisted as a soldier. The time having arri ved for him to march on to the lines, he refused to go; Weller, with three or four sol diers, went to Knapp's residence in the lower part of New Milford, in order to take him bv force. Knapp meeting him at the door, told him he had no ill will against him, but if he advanced any farther towards him he was a dead man. Weller disre garding his threats, advanced to lake him. Knapp then shot him in the groin, which caused his death in about fifteen minutes. Knapp made his escape into ihe state of New York, where it is believed he now resides. It is stated lhat Knapp was arrested a few years since on account of the above, but was rescued out of the hands of the officer by some soldiers of an independent militia company, of which he was a mem ber, who were out on a military review. SALISBURY. The principal part osthe township of Salisbury was sold by the gov ernor and company of the colony of Connecticut, in 1737, at Hartford. It had been surveyed and divided into 25 rights in 1732, being at that time known by the government only as wild, unlocated land. Three osthe rights were appropriated to public purposes; one for the support of schools, one for the first settled minister, and one for the support of the ministry. The charter osthe town was given in 1745. \"After it was located, and before the charter was given, it was known to the gov ernment by town M. Before this, it was known by no other than the Indian names Weatog and Ousalonic. It took its name from a Mr. Salisbury, who lived not far from the center of the town.\"* It appears that about the year 1700, three families came and settled in that part of the town called Weatog. These were, one family of Dutchers, one of Whites, and one of Van Dozens. While was an Englishman, but had lived with and become connected in marriage with ihe Dutch. The other two were wholly of Dutch origin. About the year 1740, there were eleven English and five Dutch families, w hich were settled in different parts of the town. There were four families of Whiles in Wea tog; Bebees, not far from the falls; Lambs, at the forge in the hollow; Herveys, in the hollow; Newcombs, on the side osthe mountain, east of the road that now leads from ihe hollow to Town hill ; Woodworlhs, at the ore bed; Aliens, on the road from the hollow to the meeting house ; and Baylies, at ihe meeting house. These were the English families. The Dutch were, two Dutchers, and one Van Dozen, at Weatog; Knickerbackers, at the stone house, on the Cornwall road; Cornelius Knickerbacker, at the furnace; and Jacob Van Dozen, between the ponds, in the north part of the town. The face of ihe township, at the period of its first settlement, wore rather an un pleasant aspect. In every fall osthe year, it was burnt over, to destroy the old grass and other vegetation, and that there might be a fresh and tender crop the ensuing * Rev. J. W. Grossman's New Year's discourse, 1803. The facts respecting the first settlement ofihistown were derived from this source. \"It is currently reported, and by good authority, (says Mr. Grossman,) that this Mr. Salisbury, after moving from here, had an unruly servant girl who had run awav from him; thai he went after her, bound her with a rope, and tied her to his horse, then rode so as to pull her down, and drawed her in such a cruel manner that she died in consequence of the abuse. 'The matter was taken up in the state of New York, and he, then in old age, was sentenced by the court to be hung when he should be a hundred years old. About four years ago, he arrived to this age. A reprieve was granted h'im for a certain time ; and if he has not died lately, he is living to this day.\""], [509, "487 SALISBURY. year. Fires also were often made to ring deer. These fires were made in a circular form, and all the deer included were driven by the sire to one place, where the hunts men could easily kill them. A ring, for this purpose, was made in the northeast part of the town, and the fire ran with such rapidity, that an Indian lad was shut within the ring, overtaken by the fire, and burnt to death. These burnings, with the ponds, mountains and clefts of rocks, made the face of nature appear forbidding to those who were not apprised of the excellence of the soil. Salisbury is situated in the northwest corner of the state; bounded n. by the towns of Mount Washington and Sheffield in Massachusetts, e. by the Housatonic. separating it from Canaan, s. by Sharon, and w. by the state of New York. Its average length is 9 miles, and its breadth about 6.J, comprising an area of about 58 square miles. The face of the township is broken, consisting of elevated hills, and deep and exten sive valleys. The valleys are generally limestone, and the hills granite. It is one of the best towns for grain in the state. It is also excellent land for grazing. Salisbury, in addition to its being one of the best agricultural towns in. the state, is also much celebrated for its very rich and productive iron mines. Of these, the one known as the \" Old Ore Hill,\" located two miles west osthe Wanscopommuc Lake, has been worked since the year 1732. At that time, and for years afterwards, the ore was found lying near the surface of the earth, and was carried off in considerable quantities by those who desired to make use of it. The site of the \" Old Ore Hill\" was owned by one Bissell, who obtained the grant several years before the town was incorporated. About the year 1732, one Thomas Lamb obtained a grant of fifty acres of land, and erected the first forge built in Salisbury. His grant was situated in the south east part osthe town, on Salmon River, now called Lime Rock. From that period until the present time, the demands upon the \"Old Ore Hill\" have been constant. Within the last ten or twelve years, from five to six thousand tons of ore have been dug annually. The ore is sold at the mine for $3 a ton. One dollar and twenty five cents of this money is paid to the proprietors of the ore bed as a duty. The other dollar and seventy five cents belongs to the digger, from whose pit the ore is taken. The first furnace erected at Salisbury was built about the year 1762, upon the outlet osthe Wanscopommuc Lake, two miles east of the \" Old Ore Hill.\" It is one of the oldest establish- ments in the county, and was erected by Messrs. Samuel and Elisha Forbes, Ethan Allen,* and a Mr. Hazeltine. During the Revolu tionary war, cannon were manufactured at this furnace, for government ; also cannon balls and bomb shells. f Col. Joshua Porter was at that time a^ent for the state of Connecticut, and superintended the castings. The lar\u00b0-e and inexhaustible quantities of iron ore found in Salisbury, and the abundant supply of wood for charcoal, and other materials necessary for smelling the ore, together with the superior quality of iron, introduced other manufactures ; and * The hero of Ticonderoga. The articles of agreement entered into by these gen tlemen are still extant upon the records of the town. t The guns on board the U. S. fiigate Constitution, used by Com. Truxton, in the capture of the French frigate L'lnsurgente, were manufactured at the old furnace in Salisbury. The Salisbury iron has been, and is still used extensively in the TJ. States' and private armories."], [510, "488 SALISBURY. iron has continued from that time the staple commodity of the town. There are at present in Salisbury, 4 blast furnaces, 5 forges, with 20 fires, 2 puddling establishments, 1 screw shop, 1 anchor shop, 2 sythe manufactories, hoe manufactory, 1 2 trip hammers, cupola or pocket furnaces, for small castings. 2 From 5 to 600,000 bushels of charcoal are annuallv consumed at the different estab lishments. The puddling furnaces require from 2 to 3.000 cords of wood annually. The number of workmen emploved in the different processes of preparing the materi al and manufacturing the iron, amount in all to about 500 men. The furnaces pro duce annually from 2,000 to 2.500 tons of pig iron. The forges and puddling estab lishments annually produce from 1,200 to 1,500 tons of wrought iron, which is used for anchors, car axletrees, musket barrels, and various other kinds of drafts. The Salisbury iron ore is the brown hematite, and yields about 40 per cent of pig iron. It is well known to manufacturers, and stands as fair in the market as any other iron in the country. Southwest view of the Churches in Salisbury Center. The above is a representation osthe churches and some other build ings, in that part of Salisbury called \" Salisbury Center.\" The Con gregational church is seen on the right ; the next building eastward, with a small cupola, is the academy ; and still farther to the east is seen the Episcopal church. The public house seen opposite was construct ed upon the frame of the old meeting house. This place is 50 miles from Hartford, 53 from New Haven, 8 from Sharon, and 34 from Hud son. The principal part osthe iron ore obtained in this town, is about 2J miles s. w. of this place. There are four churches, viz., 2 Meth odist, 1 Congregational, and 1 Episcopal ; and five post offices, Salis bury Center, Lime Rock, Furnace Village, Falls Village, and Chapin ville. The people first met for public worship in a house near where the furnace now is, (in Furnace Village,) consisting of one room, only 2G feet by 15. This contained all the worshiping congregation in tbe town. After this, they met in the house of Mr. Lee, the first settled minister in the town : here they continued to worship till a meet ing house was erected, about the year 1748. The place on which it stood was given by Col. Robert Walker for a meeting house, burying ground and green, upon the con-"], [511, "489 SALISBURY. dition that the burying yard be inclosed with a decent fence. In the house where they worshiped, there were two watchtowers made, and sentries placed in them on the Sabbath, to guard from the Indians. So late in the settlement of the town as this, an alarm was made of an Indian invasion. On this alarm, this preparation of defense was made. On the same occasion, a fort was built on the west side of the Furnace Pond, and another in the southeast part of the lown. ' There were two other forts in Weatog, built, however, before this : these two were built in the form of block-house. One was the dwelling house of Mr. Dutcher, one of the first settlers, built in 1726, and was the first framed house in the town. The first white person born in the town was Hartman Van Dozen. The first buried, by the Congregational meeting house, was Jehiel Moore. The first buried on Town Hill was a Mr. Cory, who was killed at the raising of a house, as nearly as can be known, at the same instant the town establish ed that as a public burying ground. At the time of the first settlement in the town, there was then an Indian settlement at Weatog, consisting of seventy wigwams, all in a cluster. They were friendly and hospitable, especially to the whites, and encouraged their settlement. It is unknown how long they had made a stand at that place. Doublless, in their most savage state, they had encamped in different places on the river, where they could hunt and fish. Long before there was any settlement of white people in the town, a Col. Whiling, with his regiment, pursued a band of Indians as far as the northeast part osthe town, and there, on Ihe banks of the Housatonic, defeated them with a dreadful slaughter. They lay at their ease, sporting and fishing, on both sides osthe river. He, becoming acquainted with their situation, came upon them unawares, killed some, and put the rest to flight. About seventy Indian graves are visible there lo this day. In the battle, but one of the whites was killed. When Col. Whiting drew near the place of battle, he commanded every man to throw away the priming in his gun, and to prime anew. All, except one, obeyed. He boldly declared himself willing to venture his life with the priming he then had. When they came upon the Indians, he leveled at one, snapped, and his gun failed to go off. The Indian instantly clapped up his piece, and shot him dead.* The following singular occurrences are said to have taken place in this town, near the boundary between Connecticut and Massachusetts. The relation of these circumstances was obtained from Mr. S. Sage and his family, who are still living on the spot, (June, 1836,) and could be corroborated by great numbers of people now living. \" These occurrences commenced Nov. 8th, 1802, at a clothier's shop : A man and two boys were in the shop ; the boys had retired to rest, it being between 10 and 11 o'clock at night. A block of wood was thrown through the window ; after that, pieces of hard mortar, till the man and boys became alarmed, and went to the house to call Mr. Sage, who arose from bed and went to the shop, and could hear the glass break often, but could not discover from whence it came, notwithstanding the night was very light. He exerted himself to discover the cause without success. It continued constantly till day light, and then ceased till the next evening at 8 o'clock, when it commenced again, and continued till midnight ; then ceased till the next evening at dusk, and continued till some time in the evening, and then ceased. The next day it commenced about an hour before sun-down, and continued about an hour, and then it left the shop and be gan at the dwelling house of Mr. Ezekiel Landon, 100 rods norlh, in the town of Shef field. It continued several hours, and ceased till the next morning : when the family were at breakfast it began again, and continued two or three hours, and ceased till evenin\" when it began again and continued several hours, and ceased till the next morning, when it began again and continued all the forenoon, and then ceased alto gether. The articles thrown into the shop were pieces of wood, charcoal, stone, but principally pieces of hard mortar, such as could not be found in the neighborhood. Nothin\" but stones were thrown into the house of Mr. Landon, Ihe first of which were thrown into the door. There were 38 panes of glass broke out osthe shop, and 18 out osthe dwelling houses: in two or three instances persons were hit by Ihe things that were thrown. What was remarkable, nothing could be seen coming till the glass broke and whatever passed through, fell directly down on (he window still, as if it had been put through with a person's singers, and many pieces of mortar and coal were * Dr. Trumbull thinks there must have been some mistake about the name of the commanding officer in this expedition.

Many hundreds of people assembled to witness the scene, among whom were clergvmen and other gentlemen, but none were able to detect the source osthe mischief. The more credulous readily believed it to be witchcraft, but it was generally thought to be some slight of hand, ef fected by a combination of individuals, as ihe windows were broken on different sides of the buildings nearly at the same time.\" The following inscriptions were copied from monuments in the yard in Salisbury center. In memory osthe Rev. Jonathan Lee, this stone, the fruit of conjugal affection and filial gratitude, is erected. He was born July 4th, A. D. 1718 ; graduated at Yale Col lege, 1742; was a settled minister in this town 45 years; and died Oct. 8th, 1788, in the 71st year of his age.

The township of Sharon was surveyed by a committee, appointed by the General Assembly, in 1732. The committee were Edmund Lewis, Esq. Capt. Stephen Noble, and Mr. William Gaylord. The sale of the township was ordered in October, 1737, and a committee, consisting of Samuel Eels, Esq. Joseph Whiting Esq. and Capt. Isaac Dickerman, was appointed to give deeds to the purchasers. The opinion of the committee who laid out the town, of the feasi bility and character of the lands in this town, is expressed in the fol lowing words. \" In the second township, we find two pieces, which may contain 500 acres. There is laid out in it of county grants 400 acres, and a considerable quantity of rough land, yet we find such a quantity of feasible land in it, and not so scattering as in the first town ship, (Salisbury,) as will in our judgment accommodate a sufficient number of inhabitants for a town.\" Settlements commenced in the year 1739. The first white man who lived in Sharon was one Daniel Jackson. He was originally from New Milford, and probably came to this town by the way osthe Oblong set tlements in the state of New York. He purchased of the state about 400 acres of land, which lay in the southwestern\" part osthe town, ata place now called Hitchcock's corner, and for which he obtained a patent. He stayed in town but a short time, and in February, 1739, sold his patent to Garritt Winegar, a Dutchman, and himself removed to Great Barrington, Mass. Mr. Winegar built the first grist mill in Sharon. The road which the first settlers traveled when they came to Sharon,"], [513, "491 SHARON. crossed the Housatonic river at Chiddester's ferry, near the present site of Lewis' bridge.

The vil lage of Sharon, which may consist of about 50 or 60 dwelling houses, in the vicinity of the churches, is situated principally on one street, on the eastern side of a beautiful valley, 16 miles from Litchfield, and 47 from Hartford. The central street runs about 1J miles from the boun dary line of the state of New York. There is a pleasant and interest ing village at \" Hitchcock's corner,\" situated partly in New York and partly in Connecticut, in a beautiful and populous valley, and rich in the resources of agricultural wealth. Ellsworth society, in the south part of the town, was established in 1800."], [514, "492 SHARON. Sharon is bounded n. by Salisbury, e. by the Housatonic river, sepa rating it from Cornwall, s. by Kent, and w. by the slate of New York. Its length is about 9 miles, and its breadth nearly six. The surface and soil of the township are strikingly diversified. The eastern part osthe town abounds with elevated hills, and some mountainous ranges. This district affords good grazing ; the soil is a gravelly loam, and consider ably stony. The western part of the township, which borders on the state of New York, is part of an extensive valley, having a level or un dulating surface, and a rich and fertile soil, and is considered one of the best tracts in the state for raising grain. Agriculture is the principal business of the inhabitants. Raising of sheep is followed to a consid erable extent. There were some Indian settlements in the northwestern part of the town, which had been visited by a Moravian missionary. The name of the missionary was David Bruce, who died and was buried on the Indian lands in Sharon, in the year 1724. His monument is still re maining. The Indians left the town soon after the settlers came on.* The town was incorporated in October, 1739. The first town meet ing was holden December 11, 1739. Capt. Dunham was moderator. Lieut. Jabez Crippen, Mr. John Sprague, Capt. Jonathan Dunham, selectmen. James Smith, constable. George Way, grand juror. Na thaniel Skinner, town clerk. The first tavern was kept by Jonathan Dunham. The first minister was Peter Pratt, who was ordained on the last Wednesday of April, 1740 : he was dismissed in 1745, for intemperance. The first meeting house was built of logs, in 174 L. Another meeting house was com menced in 1742, which stood about 25 years. The second minister was Rev. John Searle. He was from Sims bury, and was ordained on the first Wednesday of August, 1749. He was dismissed in 1754, on account of feeble health. He recovered his health, however, and was afterwards settled at Stoneham, Massa- * \" Considerable numbers of the Indians resided in the western and northwestern parts osthe town, which are watered by -two large ponds, and by the Ten Mile river, which touches the western borders of the town. Their principal village was on the east side of the Indian pond, so called, which is a body of water lying partlv in the state of New York, and partly in Connecticut. On a romantic and beautiful plain, lying between this pond on the west, and the Indian Mountain, a spur of the Tagh hannuck range, on ihe east, was a numerous village, where the natives continued to reside for many years after the whites came into the town. This tribe was visited by the Moravian missionaries, and one of them died and was buried there. He died in 1749, and a plain stone was placed over his grave, with the following inscription : ' David Bruce of Edinburgh in Scotland, Minister of The Brethren's church among the Indians. Depart'd 1749.' \"N. B. The grave stone is broken into several fragments, and has long since been removed from the grave. By putting ihe several parts of the stone together, the fore going inscription can be easily detected. \"The letters are Roman characters, and are become nearly illegible. Tradition says very little of the man, and he had probably been in the place but a short time when he died. It is hoped that a more suitable monument may soon be erected to the memory of this self-denying and elevated missionary.

It is said by the late Dr. Dwight, in his Travels, that Mr. Searle and the late Judge Noble of Williams town, Mass., were the first persons who ever went to the top of Sad dle Mountain, the highest mountain in Massachusetts. He is repre sented as a man of mild and unassuming deportment, much given to metaphysical investigation, and he left Sharon, carrying with him the affectionate regards of his people. The third minister was Rev. Cotton Mather Smith, who was settled in August, 1755. He was from Suffield, and spent a long life in the ministry in Sharon. Probably no minister ever had in a greater degree the confidence and affection of his people, than Mr. Smith. He is never spoken of at this day, by those who knew him, but with the most unqualified respect and veneration, and the memory of his virtues and his excellence is now, at the distance of more than thirty years from his death, cherished with the most unfeigned satisfaction. He was the father of Hon. J. C. Smith, late governor of this state. The Episcopal society was established in 1754. Mr. Ebenezer, Dibble was the first minister of that order in the town. He was suc ceeded by a Mr. Davies, who died in early life. For a number of years the worship of this denomination was suspended, but within a few years they have erected a handsome church, and now maintain regu lar worship. A new Congregational meeting house was erected in 1767 ; this was used by the society until 1824, when the present brick church was erected. In the latter part of July, 1770, Rev. Geo. Whitfield passed through this town on a preaching tour. There was considerable oppo sition to his being admitted into the meeting house, and arrangements had been made to hold the service in an orchard, still standing near the meeting house, in case he should be refused. Mr. Smith however in vited him into the pulpit, though strongly opposed by a considerable number of influential men. An immense congregation from this and the neighboring towns filled the meeting house to overflowing. His text was, \"Marvel not that I said unto you,\" &c. Having announced his text, he proceeded to discourse on the doctrine of the new birth with astonishing power and eloquence, and the congregation were much moved by the power of the truth and spirit of God. The concluding words of his discourse were a quotation, with a little variation, from the last verse of the 4th chapter of Solomon's Song : \" Awake, O north wind, and come, thou south ; blow upon this garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into this garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.\" Many of the inhabitants of-Sharon followed him for several successive days, to hear the word of life from this devoted minister of the cross. The first preaching in this town by clergymen in the Methodist con nection, was in 1787. In the following year a society was formed. Camp meetings were holden in this town in 1805 and 1806. Their first meeting house was erected in 1807. In consequence of the in crease of the congregation, a large and beautiful house is now being erected by the society."], [516, "494 SHARON. Among the early settlers of the town was John Williams, Esq., who spent his life here, and who was a man of much respectability and influence in this town and coun ty. He was from Lebanon, and came into the town in 1744. He was educated at Yale College, and studied medicine, but it was not known that he ever engaged in pro fessional business. He was soon appointed town clerk, which office he held for more than 30 years. He was the first judge of probate for the district of Sharon, and one of the judges of the first county court for Litchfield county, of which court he was for a number of years the chief judge. So great was ihe estimation in which he was held by his fellow citizens, that he was elected a representative from the town of Sharon 27 times. He also commanded a regiment of colonial militia. There are those now living, who have a distinct recollection of his personal appearance, and ol the very influential character which he sustained in the affairs osthe town. He is repre sented as a man of tall and slender frame, but of great gravity, and of very dignified deportment. His woid was law, and it was in his presence that evil doers fell terror. He died March 14, 1774, in the 60th year of his age. This town took an active part in favor osthe country in the Revolu tionary struggle. Mr. Smith, the minister, was an ardent patriot, and in his public ministrations there was mingled much osthe stirring patri otism osthe times.* A large number of men from this town were con stantly on duty ; four of whom, to wit, Adonijah Maxim, Daniel Goss, Wm. Gray, and Samuel Lewis, were taken prisoners with Ethan Allen, in his rash attack on Montreal in 1775, and with him were carried to England in the fall of that year. They were brought back to New York in the following spring, from which place the prisoners above na med made their escape. Of this number Mr. Maxim is still living. In the campaign of 1776, Parson Smith went with the army to the north as chaplain. One soldier, Alexander Spencer, went with Colonel Arnold in the expedition to Quebec, through the wilderness of Kennebeck, but he died on the march. Charles Gillet was killed near the Cedars, in the campaign of 1776, in a skirmish at that place. Daniel Wood, Nathaniel Buel, Josiah Coleman, Jabcz Jennings, Asahel Somers, John Randall, jr. and Thomas Ackley, were taken prisoners at Fort Washington, of whom Wood and Coleman died during their captivity. William Goodrich was killed at the battle of Brandywine. Samuel Elmar, jr. was killed at the skirmish of Compo bridge, and John Hollister was killed at the battle of Stillwater, Oct. 7, 1777. In November, 1784, the town was visited with the small pox, and a large number of persons, as many as 30, died in the course of two months. EXTRACTS FROM NEWSPAPERS. From the Connecticut Journal. Sharon, Feb. 15, 1781. This morning, the wife of William Hendrick Levo, was found dead in the street, a sucking child, about three months old, lying dead by her side : being under straitened circumstances, she went to town, about three miles, in order to procure something for * The approach of a large British army from Canada, under Gen. Burgoyne, and the expedition up the North River, under General Vaughan, in 1777, silled the whole country with terror and despondency, and created strong fears and doubts as lo ihe issue of the controversy: the firmness and confidence of Parson Smith, however, re mained unbroken, and his efforts to revive the drooping spirits of his people were un remitted. In the month of October, he preached a sermon from these words : \" Watch man, what of the night 1 The Watchman saith, the morning cometh.\" In this dis course he dealt much upon the indications, which the dealings of Providence afforded that a bright and glorious morning was about to dawn upon a long night of defeat and disaster. He told the congregation, lhat he believed they would soon hear of a signal victory crowning the arms of America ; and he exhorted them to trust with an unsha ken and fearless confidence in that God, who, he believed, would yet crown with suc cess the efforts of the friends of liberty in this country. Before the congregation was dismissed, a messenger arrived with the intelligence of the surrender ot Burgoyne's army Parson Smith read the letter, conveying the intelligence, from the pulpil, and a flood of joy and gratitude burst from the congregation. f f >"], [517, "495 TORRINGTON. the comfort of the family, and carried the little infant in her arms. On her return, the evening before, she went into a house to warm : the weather being extreme cold, she was prevailed to tarry, (hough very much against her inclination ; being greatly exercised for her children she had left at home, the eldest not being above ten years, her husband gone to mill, and she was doubtful of his return. In the night she arose, unknown to any in the family. She had traveled homewards about three quarters of a mile, and was found dead in the manner already described, wilhin about ten rods of an house. Some were ready to conclude she had made too free use of strong drink, which occasioned her perishing in this manner ; but upon a careful enquiry it appears to be without foundation, and that her death was occasioned by the extremity of Ihe season. Last Thursday evening arrived in this town, (Litchfield,) fiom Hartford, Colonel Samuel Canfield and Uriah Tracy, Esq. with orders from the General Assembly to repair to the town of Sharon, and put a slop to the insurrection that appeared to be raising in that town.

The following inscriptions are from monuments in tbe grave yard north of the Congregational church. The Rev.

TORRINGTON. Torrington was a township which was allotted to the Windsor pro prietors by the Legislature. It was named Torrington at the session in May, 1732. \" The number of proprietors was one hundred and thirty six. At their first meeting in Windsor, Sept. 10th, 1733, they voted to make a division of lots in Torrington, and that there should be one acre to the pound on the list of each proprietor. A survey of the town was completed in 1734. In 1737, the proprietors voted a second division of the lands, and to lay out one acre to the pound on the list of each proprietor. About five years after, another division was voted."], [518, "496 torrington. The first settler that moved into the township was Ebenezer Lyman, from Durham, with a young family, consisting of three persons only ; this was in 1737. Several young men had, however, labored in the township the summer previous. Jonathan Coe was the second person who moved into the place ; he also was from Durham. The principal settlers were from Windsor and Durham. The settlement of this town was slow. When the first minister, the Rev. Nathaniel Roberts, was ordained, in the summer of 1741, there were but fourteen families in the town. As this was considered a frontier settlement at this time, a fortification was erected not far from the center of the town. It was incorporated in 1741. Northeast view of Wolcottville, Torrington. Torrington is bounded north by Winchester, west by Goshen, east by New Hartford, and south by Litchfield and Harwinton. It is about six miles square, containing upwards of 23,000 acres. The surface of the town is uneven, with hills and valleys ; the soil is mostly fertile, and well adapted for grazing. The township is well watered by the east and west branches of the Waterbury or Naugatuc river. There are within the limits of the town 3 Congregational churches, 1 Baptist, and 1 Methodist. There are three post offices, viz. one in the first so ciety, called the Torrington office, one in Torringford, the eastern sec tion of the town, and the other in the village of Wolcottville. Wolcottville, the principal village in the town of Torrington, is sit uated in a valley near the southern boundary of the town, at the junc tion of the two branches of the Waterbury or Naugatuc river, 26 miles from Hartford, 40 from New Haven, and 17 from the New Haven and Northampton canal at Avon. The village consists of about 40 dwelling houses, a handsome Congregational church, a three story brick build ing, used as a house of worship by various denominations, (also used for an academy,) 4 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, post office, and an ex tensive woolen factory. The engraving shows the appearance of the"], [519, "497 WARREN. WASHINGTON. village from the Hartford turnpike, looking westward. The Congrega tional church stands at the northern extremity of the village, but owing to the limited extent of the engraving, it could not be introduced. The brick building used for a house of worship is on the left, over which is seen the Litchfield turnpike, passing over the heights westward. The woolen factory is the large building with a spire. This factory went into operation in 1813. One of the principal owners was the late Oli ver Wolcott, Esq. formerly governor of the state : the village owes its rise principally to this establishment. A short distance westward of the factory, an establishment for the manufacture of brass is now erecting : it is believed to be the only one of the kind at present in the United States. WARREN. Warren was formerly a part of Kent. It was incorporated as a town in 17S6. It is bounded n. by Cornwall, e. by Litchfield, s. by Washington, and w. by Kent. Its average length from north to south is five miles, and its average breadth about four miles and a half. The township is hilly and mountainous, and its rocks and soil are of a granitic character. The agricultural productions are grass and some grain. Butter and cheese are made, and beef and pork raised by the inhabitants. The town is watered by the Shepaug, a branch of the Housatonic. Raumaug pond, a considerable body of water, is situated partly in this town, and partly in Washington. The population of the town in 1810 was 1,096; inl 830 it was re duced to 986. The central part of the town is 8 miles west from Litchfield, 38 from Hartford, and 45 from New Haven. WASHINGTON. Washington was incorporated by the General Assembly in 1779. Judea, the first society in this town, was incorporated by the General Assembly in 1741 ; before this period it was included in the ecclesias tical society of Woodbury. The first settlement in the limits of Ju dea was made by Joseph Hurlburt, about the year 1734. \" The first sermon preached in this society was by Mr. Isaac Baldwin, of Litch field, who afterwards relinquished the ministry, and became the first clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in the county of Litchfield. All the inhabitants attended on this occasion, and were accommodated in a small room in Mr. Hurlburt's dwelling house. The Rev. Reuben Judd, the first minister settled in this society, was ordained Sept. 1st, 1742. The ordination was attended in a grove, and the first church was formed, consisting of 12 male members, on the same day. The same year, the first church was built, by eight propri etors. The second church was raised in 1751. In July, 1800, this church was set on fire by an insane man, named David Titus ; but by 63"], [520, "498 WASHINGTON. a seasonable discovery and the exertions of the people, the flames were extinguished within an hour. In April, 1801, the same building was again set on fire by the same man, it being unknown till this time that he did the mischief before. The fire was put in the steeple about midnight, and had made such progress before it was discovered, that no exertions were made to extinguish it. The people were scarcely able to preserve the neighboring buildings from destruction. As no alarm could be given by the bell, many of the inhabitants, and some within half a mile, were ignorant osthe disaster till the next morning. Washington is about 10 miles from Litchfield, and is 40 miles s. w. from Hartford, bounded n. by Warren, w. by New Milford and Kent, e. by Litchfield and Bethlem, and s. by Woodbury and Roxbury. Its average length from north to south is about 7 miles, and its breadth more than 5. A large part of this town is elevated and mountainous. Limestone abounds in many of the valleys. Several quarries of mar- ble have been worked, from which considerable quantities have been raised. Iron ore has been found in various places. Ochre, fuller's earth, and white clay, have also been found. The town is watered by the Shepaug river, a branch of the Housatonic, which passes through the whole length of the town, dividing it into two nearly equal parts. The town is divided into two societies, Judea and New Preston. There is in Judea, or Washington, as it is called, about two miles southeast of the center, a place called \" Steep Rock.\" From the top of this eminence, which is easy of access, the beholder has one of the most interesting and beautiful prospects in the state. The scene presents an area, in the form of an amphitheater, the sides of which are covered with a dense sorest. The Shepaug river is seen flowing in a beautiful circle at the base of the bluff. Within the circle of the river, there are several cultivated fields, affording a beautiful landscape to the be holder. This town has been the theater of one of the most atrocious murders ever commit ted in New England. The murderer was a man, or rather fiend, by the name of Bar nelt Davenport. From his own confession, it appears that his parentage and early education were exaclly fitted to produce his wicked life and his tragical end. Untu tored and unrestrained by parental government, he was left to grow up at random. In the morning of life.no morality was inculcated upon him, and no sense of religion, either by precept or example. On the contrary, he was, from early vears unprinci pled, profane, and impious. Before he was nine years old, he was expert in cursing and swearing, and an adept in mischief. At 11 years he began to pilfer. At 13 he stole money. At 15 he entertained thoughts of murder, and rapidly waxed harder and bolder in wickedness. At 19, he actually murdered a family in cold blood. As a friendless wandering stranger, he was taken into the house of Mr. Caleb Mallory, and treated with the utmost kindness, in December, 1779. Scarcely two months had elapsed, before the murder was determined on. The night of Feb. 3d, 1780, was six ed on to execute the horrid purpose. With a heart hard as adamant, he lighted a candle, went into the lodging room of his benefactors, and beat them to death with a club. A little grandchild being with its grand parents shared the same fate, and two others were left in a sound sleep to perish in the flames. Having kindled a fire in three of the rooms, he fled, after robbing the house of its most valuable articles. Bui from an accusing conscience, and from the hand of justice, which followed hard upon his steps, he was unable to flee. He was taken and executed at Litchfield in the May ensuing."], [521, "499 WATERTOWN. WATERTOWN. Watertown was formerly a parish in Waterbury, by the name of Westbury. It was incorporated as a town in 1780. It is bounded n. by Litchfield, e. by the Naugatuc river, separating it from Plymouth, w. by Bethlem and Woodbury, and s. by Middlebury and Waterbury. It is about 6\u00a3 miles in length, and 4 in breadth. The township is gen erally uneven, or rather hilly ; but some sections are level. The pre vailing soil is a dry gravelly fertile loam, and best adapted to grazing, but the different grains common to this part of the country are culti vated. Steel's Brook, a sprightly stream, passes through the central part of the town, and for a mile below and some distance above the center of the town, a chain of rich meadows, though small in extent, border the sides of this stream. Northeastern view of Watertown, (central part.) The above is a northeastern view of the Congregational and Episco pal churches in Watertown. There is a little cluster of houses a few rods south of the churches, which are not seen in the engraving. It is stated that there was a very large quantity of heavy timber used in the construction osthe Congregational church seen in the engraving. The builders were obliged to get assistance from five towns, in order to raise it. This place is 10 miles s. e. from Litchfield, 30 from Hartford and 26 from New Haven. The town was first settled about three miles north of the churches, and about half a mile west of the Litchfield road. The first family or families, were osthe name of Guernsey or Garnsey, from Milford. It was considered such an undertaking, at that period, that prayers were put up for their safe arrival, &;c. This town has been noted for the size of its forest trees. It is said that one of the first settlers, having no shelter for the night, peeled off the bark of one of the trees he had felled, and laid down upon the inside. In the"], [522, "500 watertown. morning when he awoke, he sound the bark rolled up so closely that it was with some difficulty he could extricate himself. It is also related, that one of the first settlers, by the name of Brown, was so straitened in his circumstances, that he sold one of his children (a son) to one of his neighbors, for a barrel of pork, in order to obtain something for the rest of his children to subsist on. Some of the most respectable in habitants of the town are the descendants of this child. Mr. Trumbull, the first minister of the town, was ordained at the house of Deacon Hickox, about two miles eastward osthe churches. The widow Judd, now [1837] living, at the age of almost 100 years, was baptized by Mr. Trumbull, a few days after his ordination, being the first child bap tized in the place. North vieiv of the Trumbull House, Watertown. The above is a representation of the house where John Trumbull, Esq. the celebrated author of M'Fingal, was born. This house is now owned by Mr. Pitcher, and is about half a mile below the Congrega tional church, on the east side of the Waterbury road. A large elm is seen in the distance. The business part of the town was formerly near this spot. The churches were first erected near the burying ground. John Trumbull, the author, was the son ofa clergyman osthe same name, and born April 21th, 1750. He was an only son, aud of a delicate and sickly constitution. He received the strictest care from his mother, who was a woman of superior education for those of her day; young Trumbull gave early manifestations of his poetical turn. He was educated at Yale College. In 1771, he wilh his friend Dr. afterwards Presi dent Dwight, were chosen tutors. In 1773, he was admitted to the bar in Connecticut, but soon removed his residence to Boston, where he continued his studies in the office of John Adams, afterwards President. The Revolutionary struggle was then com mencing, and Trumbull entered with warmth into the controversy. He returned to Connecticut, and began practice at the bar in New Haven, in 1774. In 1775, he wrote the first part of his M'Fingal, which was immediately published at Philadel phia, where Congress was then sitting. He removed to Hartford in 1781, where he fixed his residence. The poem M'Fingal was completed and published in Hartford, in 1782. In 1801, he was appointed judge of the superior court of Connecticut, which office he held till 1819. In 1825, he removed to Detroit, to reside with his daughter, where he died in 1831. \" M'Fingal is a burlesque poem, directed against the enemies of American liberty, and holding up to particular scorn and contempt, the tories and the British officers, naval, military, and civil, in America. It is a merciless satire throughout: whatever"], [523, "WINCHESTER. 501 it touches, it transforms; kings, ministers, lords, bishops, generals, judges, admirals, all take their turn, and become in the light or associations in which they are exhibited, altertately the objects of our merriment, hatred, or scorn. So wedded is the author to his vein of satire, that even M'Fingal, the friend of England, and the champion osthe tories, is made the undisguised scoffer of both them and their cause. The story of M'Fingal is this : the hero, a Scotchman and justice of the peace in a town near Bos ton, and who had two gifts by virtue of his birth, \" rebellion and the second sight,\" goes to a town meeting, where he and one Honorfus make speeches at each other through two whole cantos. At the end of the second canto, the town meeting breaks up tumultuously; and the people gather round a liberty pole, erected by the mob. Here M'Fingal makes a virulent speech of near two hundred lines, at the end of which he is pursued, and brought back to the liberty pole, where the constable is swung aloft, and M'Fingal tarred and feathered. M'Fingal is set at liberty ; he goes home, and at night makes a speech to some of his lory friends in his cellar, extending through the rest of the poem, leaving only room to tell that the mob broke off his ad dress in the middle by assaulting the house, and M'Fingal escaped to Boston. These are all the incidents, and this the whole story of a poem of four canlos, and consisting of some thousands of lines.\"* The following inscription is copied from a monument in the yard a little distance north osthe Trumbull house. Sacred to the memory of the Rev. John Trumbull, A.M. Senior Pastor of the church ot Christ in Westbury; and one of the Fellows of the corporation of Yale College, who died Deer. 13th, 1787, in ihe seventy third year of his age, and the forty eighth of his ministry.

Behold the upright man ! His end is Peace. WINCHESTER. This township was laid out into distinct lots in 1758. It belonged to patentees in Hartford, was incorporated as a town in 1771, and the year after the Rev. Joshua Knapp was ordained the first minister. Winchester is bounded n. by Colebrook, w. by Norfolk and Goshen, e. by Barkhamsted, and s. by Torrington. It is 6 miles in length, and more than 5 in breadth. \" The township is situated in the evergreen district osthe state,\" and is hilly and mountainous. Its geological char acter is primitive, the rocks and stones consisting of granite, mica slate, and other primitive formations ; the soil is a hard, coarse, gravelly loam. The lands afford very good grazing, and the making of butter and cheese constitutes the principal agricultural interest in the town. There are 4 houses of worship, 2 Congregational, 1 Methodist, and 1 Universalist. The borough of Clifton, (formerly Winsted, West village,) in the town of Winchester, was incorporated in 1832. It is a flourishing vil lage, consisting of about 60 or 70 dwelling houses, and 4 mercantile stores. The village is principally built in a narrow valley, on the banks of a mill stream, called Mad river, which is a tributary of Farmington river. The valley at this place is but barely of sufficient width to ad mit of a street, with buildings on each side, the ground rising immedi- * Kettell's Specimens of American Poelry, vol. 1."], [524, "502 WINCHESTER. North view of Clifton, Winchester. ately on every direction. Westward of the main street in the village, a road passes up a steep hill for nearly a quarter of a mile, where, upon an elevated plain, is an interesting lake or pond, which is one of the largest bodies of water in the state, being Z\\ miles in length and three fourths of a mile in breadth. The outlet of this lake presents a novel scene ; it consists of a small stream, compressed within a narrow chan nel, and literally tossed from rock to rock till it unites with Mad river. Most of the manufacturing establishments in the village are situated on this outlet, upon which there are some of the best natural sites for hy draulic works in the state. In this village are four large sythe facto ries, 1 machine shop, and 5 forges. The ore to supply these forges is brought from Canaan, Kent, and Salisbury. There are two churches in the village ; 1 for Methodists and 1 for Universalists. The Metho dist church is the building seen in the central part of the engraving, with a spire. The Congregational church, in the central part of the town, is situated about 4 miles southwest osthe village. The following shows the appearance of Winsted, (or the East village,) as seen from a sandy bluff, directly south of the village. In this place is an extensive clock factory, 1 axe factory, owned by an incorporated company, and one large woolen factory, and an iron foundery. The Congregational church is seen in the central part osthe engraving, dis tant from the Methodist church in Clifton about three fourths of a mile. The clock and axe factories are situated north of the church, in that part of the village called Whitingville ; the clock factory is just seen in the distance, near the church; the post office is in this village. Win sted is 26 miles from Hartford, 49 from New Haven, 17 from Litch field, 9 from Wolcottville, and 6 from Hitchcocksville. Winchester (as has been stated) lies within the \" evergreen district,\" so named from the forests of hemlock and other evergreen trees with"], [525, "503 WOODBURY. South view of Winsted, Winchester. which it abounds. These \" Green Woods\" present one of the most impressive scenes which can be found in an American sorest. The branches of the trees are thickly covered with a deep green foliage, intimately interwoven over head, and nearly exclude the light of the sun ; and the scene forcibly reminds the traveler osthe words of Thom son, in his celebrated hymn : \"Oh, talk of Him in solitary glooms! Where, o'er the rock the scarcely waving pine Fills the brown shade with a religious awe.\" WOODBURY. \"The Legislature, in 1672, granted liberty to Mr. Sherman, Mr. Wm. Curtiss, and their associates, to make a plantation at Pomperaug. Such a number of settlements had been made there in about. two years, that the Assembly in May, 1674, enacted that it should be a town by the name of Woodbury.\" The tradition is, that the first settlers were sent here by Governor Winthrop ; they were directed to follow the Pomperaug river up eight miles from its junction with the Housatonic, in order to find the place designed for their settlement. When they came to the Pomperaug, the stream appearing so small, they concluded they were mistaken in the river, and accordingly they proceeded on to the Shepaug, which they followed up the distance of eight miles to Roxbury valley. This place not answering the description given of Pomperaug, they crossed over the wilderness eastward to Woodbury valley, which they found was the object of their pursuit. The first house in the town is said to have been built about 20 rods west osthe South Congregational church. The settlers by the name of Judson set themselves down in what is"], [526, "504 WOODBURY. now called Judson Lane ; the Shermans settled about one mile south east of the Episcopal church, now called Middle quarter; the Martins located themselves about three fourths of a mile northerly ; the Miners placed themselves on the west side of the Pomperaug. The Rev. Zachariah Walker* was the first minister in the place. He was also the first minister at Jamaica, in Long Island. He probably came from England before he was ordained, and it is supposed he preached at Ja maica as a licentiate. It is believed that he removed to Stratford in 1668, and from thence to Woodbury .f Woodbury is bounded n. by Bethlem, e. by Watertown and Mid dlebury, w. by Roxbury, and s. by Southbury. It is about 7 miles long from north to south, and averages nearly six miles in breadth. The soil is generally warm and fertile. The central part of the town con sists of a village of 75 or 80 houses, and is pleasantly situated in a level valley, near the confluence of a number of small streams, which form the Pomperaug. It is surrounded by high hills on every side, forming a kind of amphitheater. The hill lying immediately east from the main street is of considerable elevation, and on its southern descent, fronting the west, the rocks descend perpendicularly, presenting a front similar to those of the East and West Rocks, near New Haven, though upon a much smaller scale. This is true to some extent on the eastern side of this range of rocks. They form a very striking feature in the land scape, as you enter the village. There are 4 houses of worship in the village, 2 Congregational, 1 Episcopal, and 1 Methodist. Woodbury is 25 miles from New Haven, 36 from Hartford, 15 south from Litch field, and 21 from Danbury. There are in the town at present, 1 tin ware, 2 nail, and 3 satinet factories. The following is a representation of what is called Bethel Rock, be ing it is said a place resorted to for religious meditation and prayer. It seems to have been brought into notice by the \" Legend of Bethel Rock,\" published in the 1st vol. of the \"Legendary,\" printed in Bos ton in 1828. This place is on the eastern side of the ledge of rocks parallel with the main road, as you enter the village from the south. It is situated about half a mile eastward from the Episcopal church. This rock (or rocks) is perhaps 30 or 40 feet in height, projecting over eastward three or four feet, and affording a kind of shelter. About 80 rods southeast of this place, a few rods eastward of a road, a monument stands alone, a representation of which is given on the opposite page. * Wood's History of Long Island. t The following tradition is preserved respecting the occasion of Mr. Walker's coming to Woodbury. At the period of the first settlement of Woodbury, there were two licentiates preaching in Stratford, Mr. Walker and Mr. Reed. As there was some controversy who should leave and go with the Woodbury settlers, ihe two licen tiates were requested to deliver a discourse on the day when it was to be decided Mr Walker in the forenoon, and Mr. Reed in the afternoon. Mr. Walker took for his text, \" What went ye out into the wilderness for to see a reed shaken with the wind *\u2022 He enlarged upon the circumstance and propriety of a reed being found in the wil derness, &c. Mr. Reed in the afternoon took for his text, \" Your adversary the devil walketh about,\" &c. In the course of his observations, he stated that the great adver sary of men was a great walker, and instead of remaining with the brethren ou\u00bbht to be kept walking at a distance from them."], [527, "WOODBURY. 505 Grave of Fisher Hartshorn, Woodbury.

He had been in Woodbury but two or three days, when he broke out with the small pox. He was removed to an old house, formerly standing near the monument, where he died. The civil authority of the town, fearing that the contagion mi\u00b0lit spread, refused to have the body buried in the common burying ground, although his brethren, the hatters, offered to do it at midnight.

Its mean length from north to south is about 25 miles, and its breadth nearly 14 miles. The general surface of the county is uneven. The soil, adjacent to the Connecticut river, and much of the upland, is generally good. The county, being intersected by Connecticut river, possesses important commercial and other advan tages. Much ship building is carried on, and formerly the foreign trade was quite extensive ; the coasting trade is still very great. Manufac tures are flourishing, particularly in and near Middletown. Great quan tities of free stone are quarried at Chatham; also considerable quantities of granite at Haddam. This business employs a considerable number of vessels to transport the stone to various places in the Union. The shad fishery in Connecticut river, is an important branch of business. Considerable quantities of wood have been exported from this county to the New York market. This county was incorporated in 1785, previous to which it belonged to the counties of Hartford, New London and New Haven ; principally to Hartford. The following is a list of the several towns in the county, with their population in 1830. Middletown, . 6,892 Chester, . .

MIDDLETOWN In March, 1650, a committee was appointed to explore the lands in Mattabesett, the Indian name for Middletown. This committee re ported that subsistence might be obtained in them for fifteen families. In the course of the year a settlement commenced near the Connecti cut, north and south of the Little river. A larger number of families than the committee contemplated was soon in the town, who were in vested with town privileges in September of the succeeding year. In November, 1653, the place was called Middletown. In 1654, there were probably about thirty families ; in 1670, the number of families was fifty two. The principal planters were from England, Hartford, and Wethersfield. The greatest number was from Hartford. There was a considerable accession from Rowley, Chelmsford, and Woburn, in Massachusetts. The township embraces four divisions, viz. Middletown, North soci ety or Upper Middletown, Middlefield and Westfield parishes, the last three of which appear to have derived their names from their relation"], [529, "507 MIDDLETOWN. to the first. The settlement in the parish of Middlefield began about the year 1710: the earliest settlers there were Samuel Allen, Benja min Miller, and Samuel Wetmore, who removed from the first society. The first white inhabitant of Westfield was Edward Higby, a native of Long Island, who settled about 1712, at the foot of that bluff, which from him is called Higby mountain. \" A portion of the lands in Middletown were given by Sowheag, the great sachem of Mattabeselt, to John Haynes, for some time governor of Connecticut, probably be fore any settlement was made in the town. On the 24th of January, 1662, Sepunnemo and other chiefs, knowing the gift of Sowheag to Mr. Haynes, sold to Samuel Wyllis and others, doubtless as agents of the colony or town, all the remaining lands in Mid dletown, including Chatham, extending six miles east osthe river, and as far west as the Court had granted the bounds of the town; excepting 300 acres, which they re served for the heirs of Sowheag and Mattabesett Indians, to be laid out east of the river; and a tract on the west side, previously laid out for Sawsean, to remain for his heirs for ever.\" A reservation also appears to have been in the neighborhood, now called Newfield, where the Indians held lands as late as 1713. Sowheag was a powerful sachem. His fort or castle was on the high ground in the west part of the city of Middletown, still called, from this circumstance, Indian hill, about three fourths of a mile northwest of the court house, where he was able, by means of his whistle, to call around him many warriors, it is said to the number of 500, whose wigwams were thick on both sides of the Connecticut eastward. His do minion extended not only over these and other Indians in Middletown and Chatham, but over the Piquag or Wethersfield Indians, whose sagamore, Sequin, was subject to him ; and as a part of the original township of New Haven was purchased of Mon towese, Sowheag's son, it is probable that his dominion embraced some of the Indians in that town. Although Sowheag gave lands to Gov. Haynes, he may be considered as a base and treacherous man. In April, 1637, some of his Indians aided the Pequots in their in cursion into that town, when they surprised and killed six men. Sowheag entertained the murderers, and treated the people of Wethersfield in a haughty and insulting man ner. It seems, however, that the people of Wethersfield had previously offered him some provocation. On hearing of their differences, the General Court were disposed to forgive him, and appointed a committee to compromise all differences with him. But he totally refused to give up the murderers, and continued his outrages against the English. The Court of Connecticut, therefore, in August, 1639, determined to send one hundred men to Mattabesett, and take the delinquents by force. They noti fied their friends at New Haven of their determination, both that they might receive their approbation in an enterprise of such general concern, and that they might make the necessary arrangements for defending their own plantations. Gov. Eaton and his council viewed it important that the murderers should be brought to justice, but in existing circumstances, deemed the measure proposed for doing it inexpedient, and dissuaded the Connecticut colony from hostile measures.

In the Upper Houses, north of the city, is Prospect hill, so named from the fine view osthe surround ing country, particularly of the windings of Connecticut river, of the city of Middletown, Chatham, &c. Just below the city, the Connec ticut turns to the eastward. Two miles and a half below Middletown city, the river being compressed to 35 rods, passes with considerable force between the high and cragged fronts of the Strait hills. Besides the Connecticut, the township is watered by two small streams, called West and Little rivers. The former passes through Durham, and unites with the latter about two miles from the Connecticut, into which the waters of these united streams are discharged, between the city and the Upper Houses. The soil in this township is favorable both for grain and grazing, is well adapted for fruit, and is generally rich and fertile. Public Buildings in the central part of Middletoivn. Middletown City was incorporated in 17S4. It is a port of entry, and the chief town of Middlesex County. It is pleasantly situated, in Lat. 41\u00b0 35' n. and Lon. 4\u00b0 15' e. of Washington, on the west bank of Connecticut river, 31 miles above its mouth, 15 miles south of Hart ford, and 24 miles n. e. of New Haven. The population osthe city in 1830 was 2,965 ; including the town, 6,892. The site of the city is principally a gentle declivity, having a gradual ascent back from the river. It is built mostly upon eight streets ; Main street, which is the principal one, runs north and south, and is about a mile in extent; it is broad and level, and contains most osthe public buildings, stores, &tc. The above is a southeastern view of five of the public buildings in Middletown. The first building seen on the left is the court house, erected in 1832. The next building is the Middletown bank, incorpo rated in 1785, with a capital of $ 100,000, which was increased in 1812 to $500,000. The building with a steeple is the first Congregational"], [532, "510 MIDDLETOWN. church ; the next building is the custom house, erected in 1835 ; the next building north is the Central Hotel and stage house. There are in the city 6 houses for public worship, 2 Congregational, 1 Episcopal, 1 Methodist, 1 Baptist, and 1 African ; 2 banks, the Middletown bank, the Middlesex County bank, and the Wesleyan University. The streets and walks are shaded with elms and Linden or lime trees. Much taste is displayed by the citizens about their residences, in the collection of choice shrubs and plants. Main street is elevated from 45 to 50 feet above the level osthe river. The rise and fall of tide water is from 18 to 24 inches. Indian or Sowheag hill, one mile from the river, is 227 feet above its level. The base osthe Wesleyan University Lyceum is 160 feet above the river, being distant five eighths of a mile. Southeastern view of the Wesleyan University, Middletown. The Wesleyan University was founded in 1831, and is an institution of great promise, under the patronage of the Methodist Episcopal church. The college buildings are finely situated, on an eminence, about half a mile from the river, commanding a view of the town, some of the neighboring villages, and a fine prospect of a most fruitful surrounding country. The college buildings were originally built for, and occupied by, the American Literary, Scientific and Military Aca demy, under the care of Captain Partridge. The Academy having failed in its operations, the buildings were vacated, and left on the hands of the proprietors. At this time, several annual conferences of the Methodist Episcopal church were preparing to establish a college under the patronage of said church, and were holding their privilege of location in the market, for the purpose of securing a liberal local sub scription. To secure this privilege, the proprietors of the Academy offered their buildings as a gratuity, for the use of a college or univer sity for ever, on condition that there should be an additional endowment raised, of $40,000. The citizens of Middletown and its vicinity, with"], [533, "511 MIDDLETOWN. a commendable zeal, by a public grant, and by private subscriptions, pledged about $ 1 8,000 osthe endowment. These offers, together with the other local advantages, fixed the university in its present location. The manufactories of the city and town are numerous. Among them are three for arms for the United States' service, 1 of broadcloth, 1 of cotton, 1 of webbing, combs, &,c. &c. One manufactory makes 1,500 rifles annually, milling all the parts ; another, 2,000 milled muskets ; another, 1,200 guns, which are cast. \" One company makes 45,000 lbs. of cotton yarn ; and another, 30,000 yards of broadcloth.\" The value of articles manufactured in this place yearly is estimated at about $700,000. The coasting trade of Middletown is extensive ; its for eign trade considerable. In 1816, more shipping was owned at this place, than any town in Connecticut. Vessels for Hartford, and other towns on the river, are registered here. The Connecticut is navigable to Middletown, for vessels drawing 10 feet of water. Its width oppo site the city, varies from 97 to 80 rods. There is a horse-boat ferry between this place and Chatham. Two miles above the city is the vil lage of Upper Middletown or Upper Houses, which contains a post office and 2 houses for public worship, 1 Baptist and 1 Congregational. Ship building has been carried on in this village for more than a century. Hugh White, Esq., the first settler of Whitestown, in the state of New York, was a citizen of Middletown. He removed from this place with his family in 1784, and penetrating beyond the Mohawk Flats, which then formed a barrier to the western settlement, located himself at Sedaghquate, now Whitesboro' village, which, till then, had been the gloomy abode of wild beasts and savage men. For the first four years after the commencement of this settlement, its progress was rather slow and discouraging ; yet, in 1788, it contained nearly 200 in habitants ; and the same year, the town of German Flats, comprising this settlement, was divided, and a new town established, which, in honor of this enterprising man, was called \" Whitestown.\" This town ship, with less than 200 inhabitants, comprised then almost all the western section of that state, which in 1810, contained 280,319 in habitants; being about 20,000 more than the whole population of Con necticut ; so that Judge White, who survived this period two years, lived to see the dreary wilderness, into which he was the first man to penetrate, and which once bore his name, contain a greater population than his native state. As was observed in his obituary notice, \" Judge White may justly be considered as the patriarch, who first led the children of New Eng land into the wilderness ; and it may be truly said, that he lived to see and enjoy the promised land.\" He died in 1812, aged 80 years.* Richard Alsop, a poet of some talent, was a native of this town, and resided here during most of his life. He was born in 1759, and was bred to the mercantile profession, but devoted himself occasionally to letters. His works embrace a variety of subjects. He published vari ous translations from the French and Italian : he left a large number of * Pease and Niles's Gazetteer."], [534, "512 MIDDLETOWN. unpublished works behind him, one of them a poem of considerable length, called the Charms of Fancy. He died at Flatbush, on Long Island, Aug. 20, 1815. EXTRACTS FROM NEWSPAPERS. Middletown, Nov. 2d, 1765. Yesterday being the day prefixed to enslave America, by an unrighteous and op pressive , some osthe principal gentlemen of this place, to shew the sense they had of their native liberty and freedom, which concluded with that fatal day, met to gether, and agreed that ihe bell should toll all day with the tongue muflled ; that min ute guns should be discharged, and a pendant hoisted half-staff high, before the town house, which was accordingly done. All the vessels in ihe harbor had their pendanls struck half-mast high. The gentlemen being met about noon, drank several loyal healths ; and among the rest this was toasted \u2014 Liberty, property and no stamps\u2014Con fusion to all enemies of liberty, &c. In the evening, the young people dressed three images : two of them were dressed very grand ; one in an arm chair, representing a iate ignoble lord ; the other, waiting on him, in a private conference, holding up a piece of parchment to him, with these words wrote in large characters, \" Let's inslave America with stamps.\" Behind them on the stage, was a most forlorn image, wilh a fierce countenance, representing the D \u2014 1, with a speared fork in his right hand, and a lanthorn in his left \u2014 (however cloven his feet were, his d \u2014 ?-ship had gloves on his hands.) On the forepart of the stage was a large lanthorn, five or six feet high, and proportionally large, filled wilh lighted candles, (the night being dark, and cloudy, made a grand appearance,) on the front of which was wrote, in large characters, Lib erty, Property, and no Stamps ; confusion to Lord B g, the D \u2014 1 and Company ; God bless King George, Pitt, Conway, Barre, and all Patriots to Liberty. Amen. Which was read off loud at every door in the town, streets and lanes, upon which the company gave three loud and hearty cheers. * * * The whole scene was over about ten o'clock ; when the said images were taken off the stage, and treated with ihe ignominy their o 1 deserved, then burnt, and their ashes were stamped into the earth. Not less than eight hundred joined in this affair; and, notwithstanding the number of all ranks, the whole was conducted and concluded with the utmost decency and good order. It would be amiss to omit, that our young children, that can hardly speak, have already learnt this lesson well \u2014 Liberty, Property and no Stamps \u2014 which they sing along the streets. Middlettncn, Nov. 12ih, 1777. On my way from the army some time since, I fell in with four well dressed men, two of which were in uniform, all with swords and cockades. I supposed they were offi cers osthe continental army, going on business like myself. We traveled to the next inn, where we stopped for refreshment, and met half a dozen more of these meek sol diers, for, on attending to their discourse, I soon found they were all itinerant traders. I fell into conversation with one of them, who informed me he had made five thousand pounds since the last year, by trade. I supposed he must have been a large importer of merchandize from abroad, but, on inquiry, found he had never risked a shilling afloat, but had been buying and selling from state to state, and from town to town ; he began with a hogshead of rum, (which he purchased with his tools, and credit, hav ing been formerly an exceeding good house carpenter :) he sold this out by the small quantity to the troops at King's bridge last campaign, and by his industrv this way had acquired the a,bove sum. This information led me to make inquiry into'the other cha racters, all of which I found of the same clan. Some had more, some less than my in formant. I arrived soon after at my own farm, and found my hired man had commen ced trader, and quilted my farm. I went after him, and found him, threatened him with the loss of his wages, if he did not return to his duty and fulfil his engagement, which was for six months : he told me he did not value his wages ; he had made money enough to buy my farm, and asked the price : He had been trading in partnership with a baker, who had turned merchant, and could not read, and gave him half the profits for keeping the accounts. I asked him why he wore a cockade : he said it answered for a pass, and he should have a uniform coat as soon as he could find a tailor, which were scarce, as they had all turned traders. I pulled out my cockade, and got me a plain coat, and now on my way to join my regiment, having completed the business I came on\u2014 Mr. Printer, I think it would not be amiss to take up all these new created gentry, form them into a regiment, send them to camp, and let them work at their old trades : they would be useful then ; they are a curse now.

SONG. A WHALING We view the monsters of the deep, Great whales in numerous swarms; And creatures there, that play and leap, Of strange, unusual forms. When spring returns with western gales, And gentle breezes sweep The ruffling seas, we spread our sails To plough the wat'ry deep. When in our station we are placed, And whales around us play, We launch our hoats into the main, For killing northern whales prepared, Our nimble boats on board, With craft and rum, (our chief regard,) Aud good provisions stored. And swiftly chase our prey. In haste we ply our nimble oars, For an assault design'd ; The sea beneath us fnams and roars, And leaves a wake behind. Capp Cod, our dearest, native land, We leave astern, and lose Its sinking cliffs and lessening sands, While Zephyr gently blows. A mighty whale we rush upon, And in our irons throw : She sinks her monstrous body down Among the waves below. Bold, hardy men, with blooming age, Our sandy shores produce ; With monstrous fish they dare engage, And dangerous callings choose. And when she rises out again, We soon renew the fight ; Thrust our sharp lances in amain, And all her rage excite. Now towards the early dawning east We speed our course away, With eager minds, and joyful hearts, To meet the rising day. Then as we turn our wondering eyes, We view one constant show ; Above, around, the circling skies, The rolling seas below. Enraged she makes a mighty hound ; Thick foams the whitened sea ; The waves in circles rise around, And widening roll away. She thrashes with her tail around, And blows her redd'ning breath; She breaks the air, a deaf'ning sound, While ocean groans beneath. When eastward, clear of Newfoundland, We stem the frozen pole, We see the icy islands stand, The northern billows roll. From numerous wounds, with crimson flood She stains the frothy seas, And gasps, and blows her latest blood, While quivering life decays. As to the north we make our way, Surprising scenes we find ; We lengthen out the tedious day, And leave the night behind. Now see the northern regions, where Eternal winter reigns ; One day and night fills up the year, And endless cold maintains. With joyful hearts we see her die, And on the surface lay ; While all with eager haste apply, To save our deathful prey. HADDAM. The lands in this town, with those in East Haddam, were long de nominated the lands at Thirty Mile Island, from the island in Connect icut river, which was calculated to be thirty miles from its mouth. The Indian title to the lands was purchased in 1662, for thirty coats, which may have been worth one hundred dollars. The deed obtained from the Indians, comprehended all the lands from the Straits, six miles east and west from the river, down to the lower side of Chester Mea dow ; eKcepting Thirty Mile Island, and 40.acres at Pattaquonk, (Ches ter,) Twenty Mile Island, and on the adjacent shore eastward, running"], [539, "HADDAM. 515 up to Salmon River cove. The lands thus purchased were taken up by twenty eight young men, mostly from Hartford, Wethersfield and Windsor, who in the summer of 1662, or soon after, settled upon them. Their names were Ackley, Arnold, Bailey, Brainard, Brooks, Clarke, Cone, Gates, Shayler, two Spencers, two Smiths, Venires, Wells, Bates, Butler, Corbe, Dibble, Ganes, Hannison, Jones, Luxford, Pa rents, Piper, Slannard, Webb, and Wiat. These proprietors settled at first within the limits of Haddam society. They settled generally on the rising ground, back from the town meadow, beginning at the eastern point of Walkley hill, and so extending down to the grave yard, where some of their cellars are still visible. Bates, Dibble, Ganes, Hannison, Jones, Parents, and Ventres, settled on the plain below Mill creek, and were called the Lower Plantation. The Indians remained on their res ervations for many years. They had a place of resort, in a deep hollow on Haddam Neck, to the northeast, which is still known by the name of Indian hollow, as the brook running through it is by the name of In dian brook. They had no name for the township of Haddam at large, but called the northern part of Haddam society Higganompos, which the English have changed to Higganum, and now apply it to a stream of water, and to the neighborhood about its mouth. The western part of this society they called Cockaponset, which the English have chan ged to Punset. Haddam was incorporated as a town in 1668. At this time it be longed to the county of Hartford, and so continued till the formation of Middlesex County, in 1785. On account of its central situation, it was constituted the semi-seat of justice for this county, and has so contin ued ever since. The town lies on both sides of Connecticut river. Haddam society is on the west side of the river, and is by far the lar gest division of the town : it is about 7 miles long, and from 4 to 6 broad ; bounded n. by Middletown, w. by Durham, and s. by Killing worth and Chester. The part of the town lying on the east side of the river is called Haddam Neck, which is a point of land, 4 miles in length, 4 miles across on the north, and coming to a point at the mouth of Sal mon river. This river bounds Haddam Neck on the east. This town ship is the commencement of the granitic district, extending to the mouth of Connecticut river. It is considerably rough and broken, be ing hilly and stony. There is but little alluvial soil upon Connecticut river, but the lands upon its borders are more smooth, and better adapted for cultivation. The prevailing soil is a gravelly loam, hard and dry. The forests are considerably extensive, and considerable quantities of wood are annu ally sent to market. There are 4 houses of worship in the town, 1 Congregational, 1 Baptist, 1 Methodist on the west side, and 1 Meth odist church on Haddam Neck. The following view was taken at a point on a hill upwards of half a mile northwest from the court house, a few rods east from the main road. Connecticut river is seen on the left ; also the mouth of Salmon river, and the southern extremity of Haddam Neck, on the east side of Connecticut river. East Haddam Landing is faintly seen in the dis-"], [540, "516 HADDAM. Northwest view of Haddam. tance, near the mouth of Salmon river, just rising above the lower ex tremity of a hill on the west side of the river. The court house ap pears nearly in the center of the engraving. It is constructed of gran ite, and was erected in* 1829: it has a small spire attached to it, and fronts the south. The large building seen on the right is the Congre gational church ; it is about half a mile, in a western direction, from the court house. On the hill which rises in the distance, between and be yond the church and court house, is seen the situation of part of the granite quarries, about 100 rods from the river. In the limits of this town are several valuable granite quarries, on both sides of the river. The first opening was made at Quarry hill, on Haddam Neck, about 1762. Since that time several other open ings have been made in this hill. These are from 50 to 70 rods from the river. This stone is usually a little below the surface, and is ex hibited in nearly perpendicular strata ; it is valuable for building, pav ing, &ic. On a hill below Haddam street, several quarries are now im proved, the first of which was opened about 1794 : besides these, there are others which are worked in the western part of the town. This stone is sold from 10 to 20 cents by the foot, and is carried as far south as Savannah and New Orleans. At this time about 150 men are em ployed at the quarries in this town, and from 60 to 70,000 dollars worth of stone are annually exported. Ship building is also carried on to some extent in this town. A sloop was launched at Higganum Landing in 1754 ; and for most of the time since, ship building has been a regular business at this place. The following is a representation of the spot, looking towards the north, where that devoted missionary, David Brainerd, first drew his breath. The house in which he was born, was probably built 160 or 170 years since. It was a one story building, 40 by 30 feet, with a portico by the south door. After this house was taken down, another was built on its foundations. This second house was taken down about"], [541, "HADDAM. 517 Birth-place of David Brainerd, Haddam. fifteen years since. The place remained in possession of the Brainerds till about the year 1802. The cellar walls still remain. The place is seen in the engraving on the right, near by which two persons are standing. The house stood a short distance from the river, at an ele vation of perhaps 100 feet from the water, and about 8 or 10 rods from the turnpike road, commanding a fine prospect of the river, both to the north and south. A spring issues in the orchard near the road, and was formerly conducted to the back door of the house. This place is half a mile from Higganum Landing, one mile and a half northeast from the court house in Haddam, and about 8 miles from Middletown. \" If ihe greatness of a character is to be estimated by the object it pursues, the dan ger it braves, the difficulties it encounters, and Ihe purity and energy of its motives, David Brainerd is one of the greatest characters that ever appeared in the world. Compared wilh this standard of greatness, what little things are the Alexanders, the C\u00e6sars, the conquerors ot the whole earth. A nobler object no human or angelic mind, could ever propose to itself, than lo promote the glory of the great Governor of ihe Universe, in studying and laboring to diffuse purity and happiness among his un holy and miserable creatures.\" His life and diary among the Indians, says a celebrated English divine, \" exhibits a perfect pattern of the qualities which should distinguish the instructor of rude and barbarous tribes ; the most invincible patience and self denial, the profoundest humil ity, exquisite prudence, indefatigable industry, and such a devotedness to God, or rather such an absorption of the whole soul in zeal for the divine glory, and the sal vation of men, as is scarcely paralleled since the age of the Apostles His con stitutional melancholy, though it must be regarded as a physical imperfection, imparts an additional interest and pathos to the narrative, since we more easily sympathize with the emotion of sorrow than of joy. There is a monotony in his feelings, it must be acknowledged, and consequently a frequent repetition of the same ideas, which will disgust a fastidious or superficial reader, but it is the monotony of sublimity.\" The ancestor of the Brainerds came to this country when a lad, and lived in the \"Wyllis family of Hartford. He afterwards removed to Haddam, and was one osthe first settlers osthe town. David, the missionary, was the third son of Hezekiah Brai nerd a man of piety and respectability, who for many years represented his native town' in the General Assembly. The Rev. David Brainerd commenced his labors among the Indians in 1743, at a place called Kaunaumeek, southeast from Albany,"], [542, "518 CHATHAM. near Kinderhook ; from this place he went to the Forks of the Delaware, near the line between New York and Pennsylvania. His greatest success was among the In dians at Crosweeksung, near Freehold in New Jersey. Overcome by wearisome journeyings and arduous labors, in the work of the ministry, he traveled into New England for the benefit of his health. He died at the house of the Rev. Jonathan Ed wards, at Northampton, Mass. Oct. 10th, 1747, in the thirtieth year of his age. CHATHAM. Chatham belonged to Middletown until October, 1767, at which time it was made into a distinct town, and called Chatham, from the importance of its ship building, in allusion to Chatham in England. The lands in this town, opposite the city of Middletown, were early im proved. \" In 1675, 40 rights were laid out between Glastenbury and Haddam lines, in lots 2\u00a3 miles long, running from what then was the eastern boundary of Middletown, towards the river ; the remaining 12 rights owned in the town being laid out in Moromos. But not withstanding these improvements and divisions of land, only two white families are known to have lived in Chatham, until after the com mencement of the last century. James StanclifF had a house on the bank of the river, nigh the end of Chatham street, as early as 1690, and John Gill had another not far from that time. The next settler after these was William Cornwell, who settled back from Chatham meadow, about 1703. In 1710 there were only nine or ten families within the limits of Chatham parish.\" A family by the name of Goffe settled south of Knowles' Landing, about 1710, who were the first in habitants within the limits of Middle Haddam.\" \" The lands in this township were obtained from the Indians in connection with the lands in Middletown. But a reservation, laid out partly at Indian hill, and partly a little east of Chatham meeting house, was held by them till about 1767 ; when having dwindled to a small number, ihey sold their right and united with the Farmington In dians. These Indians have been sometimes called Wongonks or Wongoms, but the reservation was for the heirs of Sowheag and Mattabesselt Indians, and they were doubtless of the same tribe with the Indians on the west side of the river. A little elan inhabited, or frequented, the region about Pocotopogue pond, and had a place of rendezvous on the principal island which lhat incloses. These were also, probably, a part of the Mattabesselt Indians. At Indian hill was a famous grave yard, where monuments with inscriptions were set up over some of the graves, after the English settled upon the river. Indian bones have been found also, on the left bank of Tay lor's creek, as it enters the Connecticut.\" The town of Chatham embraces Chatham parish, (formerly East Middletown,) the greater part of Middle Haddam parish, the parish of East Hampton, and part of the parish of West Chester. The town ship is bounded n. by Glastenbury, w. by Connecticut river, e. by Marlborough and Colchester, and s. by East Haddam and Haddam Neck, belonging to Haddam. There are 6 churches, 3 Congrega tional, 2 Episcopal, and 1 Methodist. The township is about\" nine miles in length from north to south, and more than 6 in breadth. The interior part osthe town is rough and broken, consisting of granite hills, interspersed with inconsiderable valleys. Upon the Connecticut, there is a considerable tract of alluvial. There are very extensive and valuable quarries of freestone on the bank of Connecticut river, nearly"], [543, "CHATHAM. 519 opposite the city of Middletown, which are worked and shaped with great facility. About 200 workmen are employed, and large quanti ties of this stone are sent to New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Charles ton, and other places. Southern vieiv of the Episcopal Church, Chatham. The above is a southern view of the Episcopal church in Chatham. It is constructed of stone from the quarries in the immediate vicinity westward. The Episcopal society in Chatham parish was formed April 17th, 1789. The Rev. Smith Miles may be considered as the first clergyman regularly settled over this society. His monument is in the new grave yard, and is of the same form as that of Mr. Ash mun, seen on page 183 of this work: the following is the inscription. \"Sacred to the memory of Rev. Smith Miles; born in Derby, March 19th, 1766; graduated at Yale College, 1791, and ordained 1795 ; officiated as Rector osthe Epis copal church in Chatham 33 years. Died Jan. 31,1830: aged 64 years \u2014 .They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as stars for ever and ever.\" The two principal streams in the township are Salmon river and Pine brook. Salmon river crosses the southeastern corner of the town. Pine Brook, a con siderable mill stream, rises in Pocotopogue pond, in the parish of East Hampton, and after a course of six or seven miles, unites with Salmon river, three miles from its mouth. Pocotopogue pond, or rather ponds, is about nine miles in circumference ; it is in the form of two ponds, nearly circular, united by a strait of no considerable width or length. Its waters are about ten feet in depth, and surround several islands, one of two acres, formerly the favorite resort osthe Indians. It is fed by low springs, as rains do not alter its height. \" Another pond within the bounds of Chatham parish, called Job's pond, is about two miles in circumference. This has no outlet. It rises and falls as much as fifteen feet, from causes which cannot be easily explained ; for it is often the highest in the dryest season of the year, and lowest in the wettest season. When it begins to rise, it rises regularly for six or twelve months, and then falls for about the same periods. This, in many places, is from 40 to 60 feet deep. \" On the banks of Connecticut river, half a mile northeast from Middletown harbor, are noted and very valuable quarries of freestone. The rocks at the northern and principal opening, according to tradition, originally hung shelving over the river. They were used for building stone very soon after Middletown was settled. At a meeting held in that lown in 1665, it was resolved that no one should dig or raise stones at the rocks on the east side of the river, but an inhabitant of Middletown, and that"], [544, "520 CHATHAM. twelve pence should be paid to the town for every ton of stones taken. As early as this, they were transported in vessels to other places. By several subsequent resolves, they appear to have been regarded as valuable, and to have been considerably sought. Some time after 1726, the town sold this quarry, and it has since passed into several hands. For forty years past it has been extensively improved, and the stones to the depth of thirty feet from the surface, are now removed over an area of an acre and a half, back from the river. The stone in this quarry is covered in some places with four or five feet of earth, and in others with four or five feet more of shelly rock. It is not perfectly solid, but lies in blocks, eight or ten feet thick, and fifty and sixty feet long. The seams and joints facilitate the process of removing these from their beds ; and when removed, they are reduced by the wedge and chisel to any size or form which is wished. In this quarry thirty hands have been employed for several years, eight months in the year, and from four to six teams. The quantity of stone prepared for market, and sold to the inhabitants of this and the neighboring towns, and exported to distant parts osthe country, has been very great ; and has yielded a handsome profit. Fifty rods south of this quarry, an opening was made about 1783, now spreading over half an acre. Here the stone is covered with about ten feet of earth. In this opening as many as twelve hands have been sometimes employed. Vessels come to this and the above quarry, and load from the bank. The bed of stone in which these and the smaller openings in tbe neighborhood have been made is im mense, and lies at different depths from the surface in different places. It has been discovered in sinking wells, for half a mile in northern and southern directions, and has been opened at a greater distance eastward. Wherever found, the stone possesses the same general properties, but varies, like the freestone in Middletown, in the fine ness of its texture.\"* \" About 1762, a cobalt mine was opened at the foot of Great hill, under the direction of Dr. Stephaunes, a German, and improved for a little time. About 1770, he renewed the improvement ofit, in connection with two gentlemen by the name ofErkelin and Khool, and continued it for two or three years. Many casks of ore were obtained and shipped for Europe. But as all the persons concerned in the mine, laborers as well as principals, were foreigners, and as the ore was exported, little was known of its character or value. After they left it, it was entirely neglected, till last autumn. Since then, several men have been employed in searching for cobalt, in and near the former openings, and have been so successful, as to encourage the hope that the mine will be permanently improved. The scarcity of this mineral, and its uses in porcelain and linen manufactories, render it highly desirable that the contents of this mine should be thoroughly explored. \u2014 Coal was discovered at Indian hill about thirty years ago. But whether it exists there or in any other part of the town in any considerable quantities, must be determined by future researches.\" EXTRACTS FROM NEWSPAPERS. Middletown, June 1th, 1799. The Launch. \u2014 More of the Wooden Walls of Columbia. \u2014 Yesterday at 35 minutes and 4 seconds past five P. M. the United States Ship Connecticut was safely deposited on the bosom of the majestic stream whence she derives her name. No words can convey an adequate idea of the beauty and brilliancy of the scene. Nature, as inclin ed to do honor to the occasion, had furnished one osthe most delightful days that the vernal season ever witnessed. While old father Connecticut eager to receive his beautiful offspring, had swollen his waters by the liquefaction of snows, reserved for the occasion, near his source, in order to facilitate her passage to his wave ; and exten ding his liquid arms, welcomed her to his embrace. Flora decked in her richest at tire, smiled gleefully around, and a brilliant concourse of spectators from this and the neighboring towns, whose countenance expressed the liveliest sensibility at thus wit nessing the progress of our nautical armament, destined to protect our commerce and hurl the thunders of Columbia on her shrinking foes, formed a most magnificent mov ing picture, in addition to the brilliancy of nature which shone around. The prepara tion for the launch was exquisite, and evincive osthe consummate skill osthe architect who superintended the operations of the day, and whose orders were given with dig nity and obeyed with punctilious nicety. When the moment arrived at which the elegant fabric was to leave her earthly bed never more to return, the anxiety of the crowd was witnessed by a solemn silence, awful and profound. The stroke was struck, the blocks were removed, when lo ! with the grace and majesty osthe divine Cleopatra, or the wonder-struck Cydnus, she glided into the arms of her parent river, and as if reposing herself to sleep upon a bed of roses, sunk upon his breast.

He was a sound and faithful divine, a Physician of Soul and Body, a sincere Friend, a faithful husband, and au affectionate Father. The memory of the just is blessed. CHESTER. Chester, formerly a parish of that name in Saybrook, was incor porated as a town in 1836. Jonah Dibble, from Haddam, appears to have been the first settler in this town : he was a resident here in 1692 : Andrew Warner, from Hadley, came about 1696. \" The ancestors of the Parkers, Shipmans, Waterhouses and Webbs, from Saybrook par ish, were early settlers in this place. George Willard and Andrew Southworth, from the same parish, Joel Canfield and Gideon Leet, from Durham, settled in it about 1745. The inhabitants were vested with parish privileges in 1740. Their first pastor was the Rev. Jared Harrison, who was ordained at the formation of the church in 1742. Chester is about 5 miles in length from east to west, and upwards of 3 in breadth, bounded n. by Haddam, e. by Connecticut river, s. by Saybrook, and w. by Killingworth. The western part of the town is rough and hilly. It is estimated that there are in the town about 1,200 inhabitants, most of whom are in the eastern part. There are 2 churches in the town, 1 Congregational and 1 Baptist. The following shows the appearance of the Chester Hotel, and some other buildings at the head of the cove, about one mile from the river, in the central part of Chester, about 17 miles from Middletown, 5 from Haddam court house, and 30 from New Haven. The Congregational church is about 80 rods north, and the Baptist about half a mile west ward of this place. Several streams run into the cove, affording fine sites for manufacturing purposes. L'Hommedieu's auger and hammer factory is finely located, and more than 20 hands are employed in this business. The Chester Manufacturing Co. manufacture coach springs : there is one cast iron foundery ; also, one factory for the manufacture of hard ware, recently erected. Messrs. Southworth and Stephens have 66"], [546, "522 DURHAM. Northern view of Chester, (central part.) a very extensive saw mill and lumber yard, which furnishes lumber and ship plank in large quantities, being it is believed one of tbe most ex tensive establishments of the kind in the state. The manufacture of gimblets, axe helves, (for which there are 2 factories,) inkstands, and some other articles, is carried on extensively. The quarrying of stone is also an important branch of business in this town, and the inhabitants are generally distinguished for their industry and enterprise. DURHAM. The tract of land comprising Durham was formerly supposed to be included in the limits of the neighboring towns, until they were sur veyed, when a tract was found to be left. This was considered small for a distinct plantation or town, and does not appear to have been con templated with that view for a long period. The Legislature however granted many lots or farms in it to persons who had performed impor tant services to the colony. In this way more than 5,000 acres became the property of individuals widely dispersed in the state, before any set tlement was made. \"In 1698, however, David Seward, from Guilford, moved into the town, and some of his neighbors contemplated following him. The next spring, therefore, a petition was presented to the Legislature, signed by thirty one inhabitants of that town, that there might be a plantation at Coginchaug, the Indian name of Durham. This was urged on the ground that Coginchaug was so far from other settlements that the peo ple could not go to them for public worship. The petition was granted, and soon after a site was selected for a meeting house, on a hill in the southern part osthe town, which from that circumstance is called Meet ing-house hill to this day. But very few of the petitioners left Guilford, and no plantation was immediately formed.\""], [547, "523 DURHAM. In May, 1704, the proprietors of farms at Coginchaug petitioned the Assembly for some act, which would encourage a settlement at that place. The Assembly proposed that the proprietors should give up one fourth part of their farms, and that the part thus given up, with the common lands, should be laid out into lots, for such persons as should offer themselves as inhabitants. Their proposal was accepted, and settlers came in from various places, who, in May, 1708, were in vested with town privileges. The number of adult male inhabitants, at that time, was thiry four, most of whom were heads of families. As early as 1723, John and Nathaniel Sutliff, and probably some others from Durham, settled on Haddam quarter. These had the consent of the people of Haddam, that they might attend public worship in Dur ham, and in 1773 the quarter was annexed to Durham. South vieiv of the Churches in Durham. \"There is no evidence that the Indians ever dwelt in Durham in any considerable numbers, or for long periods ; but they resorted to it occasionally for the purposes of hunting. They were, however, re garded as the rightful owners of the soil, and their title was purchased by Samuel Wyllys and others, on the 24th of January, 1672, at the same time that a purchase was made of the lands in Middletown.\" Durham is bounded n. by Middletown, w. by Wallingsord, e. by Haddam, and s. by Guilford, Madison and Killingworth. It is about six miles in length from east to west, and nearly four in width. The central part of the town is 20 miles south from Hartford, and 18 north east from New Haven. The prevailing surface of the town is a diver sity of moderate hills and gentle declivities and dales. The eastern and western parts are somewhat broken and mountainous. The soil is generally fertile and productive, and the inhabitants are mostly em ployed in the cultivation of the earth. The above is a view in the central part of Durham. The church seen on the left is the new Congregational church, erected in 1835. The"], [548, "524 EAST HADDAM. church seen standing in the street is the old Congregational church. The above drawing was taken September, 1835, a few days before the old church was taken down. These churches are a fair specimen of the ancient and modern method of building houses of worship. A new Methodist church is now erecting (1836) on the east side of the street, about opposite the old church seen in the engraving. The principal settlement is on the road running north and south, on ground moderately elevated, bounded on the east by a considerable range of hills, on the west with a large tract of low land, and then a tract of higher land, extending to the Wallingsord mountains. The tract of low land lying westward of the village was called Coginchaug, or the long swamp, and from this the name was applied to the township. This is generally cleared, and yields a large quantity of coarse grass. \" This town has been distinguished many years for a very fine breed of cattle. Two oxen, presented by some of the inhabitants to General Washington, furnished a dinner for all the officers of the American army at Valley Forge, and all their servants. These oxen were driven almost five hundred miles, through a country nearly exhausted of its forage, yet one of them, a steer five years old, weighed two thousand two hundred and seventy pounds.\" The following inscriptions are from monuments in the yard north of the Congregational church. In memory of Capt. Israel Camp, a man of unaffected piety; benevolent in his temper, and kind and just in his behavior; in private and public offices, useful through life; a great lover and promoter of Divine Psalmody. The praises of God and the Lamb sweetly employed his breatn, till, through painful sickness, his voice expired in death, the 6th day of May, 1778, in the 55th year of his age. Sacred to the memory of Mr. Elias Camp, who died March 2Gth, 1796, in the 78th year of his age. He was a tender husband, and obliging neighbor, and a good citizen ; and tho' denied the enjoyment of parental felicity, was blessed with so much of this world, not only to perform many deeds of charity, but to make a present of an excel lent bell to the town of Durham, which has greatly promoted its convenience and reg ularity, and ought lo be recognized wilh gratilude on every sound thereof. EAST HADDAM. East Haddam was originally a part of Haddam. It belonged to Haddam society till 1700. It was then constituted a distinct society. In 1734 it was formed into a distinct town, containing two whole par ishes, viz. East Haddam and Millington, and two thirds of the parish of Hadlyme. It does not distinctly appear at what time the first set tlement was made. It has been commonly supposed it began at the place Creek Row, about 1685, by the removal of a number of fami lies from Haddam, by the names of Gates, Bates, Brainerd and Cone. The tradition is that this was the first spot settled, and that these were the first settlers. \" But from a document found in the colony records, it is certain that Robert Chapman had a dwelling house in East Had dam, north of the Creek Row, in 1674. If the settlement at the Creek Row was first, it must have begun about 1670. The first settler in Millington was Jonathan Beebe, from New London, who settled by the Long Pond about 1704.\""], [549, "525 EAST HADDAM. East Haddam is bounded north by Chatham and Colchester, east by Salem, west principally by Connecticut river, and partly by Sal mon river, dividing it from Haddam Neck, belonging to the town of Haddam, and south by Lyme. Its average length from east to west is nearly eight miles, and its breadth upwards of six. The face of the township is rocky and uneven, but the soil is generally strong and fer tile, and well adapted to grazing. There is considerable timber in the town, which is of an excellent quality. There are 6 cotton factories, 2 of which manufacture cotton twine. This town took an active part in the Revolutionary war. About 100 men in the regular line osthe con tinental army, and quite a number in the naval service, perished in the struggle. The first supplies for the starving army at Valley Forge were sent from this town and its vicinity. Muskets were manufactured for the Revolutionary army, at the Landing, by Mr. Green. West view of East Haddam Landing. East Haddam Landing, a village of about 30 dwelling houses and three or four mercantile stores, is situated a little below the mouth of Salmon river, on. the banks of the Connecticut, about 16 miles north from Saybrook Point. A house was built at this place, and a market opened for produce, in 1743, since which most osthe trade in the town has centered at this spot. Ship building was begun at the Landing be fore the Revolutionary war, and as early as that war at Chapman's fer ry a little village about three fourths of a mile south osthe Landing. Immediately back osthe houses at the Landing, the hills rise abrupt ly, and in some places precipitously to the east and north. The an nexed view was taken from the opposite bank of the river, and shows most of the buildings in the place. The building with four chimnies, seen in the lower central part of the engraving, before which a ship yard is seen, is the residence of Timothy Green, Esq. the basement story of which is the East Haddam bank, incorporated in 1831, with"], [550, "526 EAST HADDAM. a capital os 75,000 dollars. The building on the extreme left was the residence of the late Gen. Epaphroditus Champion, and now of his son, E. Champion, Esq. It is distinguished for its bold and lofty ter races, and is a striking object to travelers passing on the river. The post office at this time is kept in a building on the opposite side of the street. The steamboat hotel is seen on the extreme right, before which is a wharf, at which the steamboats land and receive passengers. The spire osthe Episcopal church, standing on elevated ground, is seen a little distance southeast from the village. The Congregational church is situated one mile and a half eastward osthe Landing. Lord's Mills, or as it is now called Leesville, upwards of four miles northward of the Landing, is a village containing 18 or 20 dwelling houses, and is situated at the head of boat navigation on Salmon river. There are in the village 3 mercantile stores, a post office, a saw mill, and a cotton factory, containing 1,800 spindles and 40 looms. The tide at this place rises about two feet. Sloops of about 60 tons have been launched here in time of freshet. There was formerly an oil mill in this place, which was erected more than sixty years since, the first it is said erected in the state. The scenery about this village is striking and beautiful, especially the long vista which is seen on looking down Salmon river. Mechanicsville is a thriving village, upwards of 3 miles n. e. of the Landing. It contains 2 cotton factories, one for manufacturing cotton twine, the first of the kind it is said established in the United States ; it has been in operation about ten years. The village is situated on Moodus river, a branch of Salmon river. It consists of about 30 or 40 dwelling houses. A Methodist church has been recently erected in this place. \"From time immemorial, East Haddam has been the seat of uncommon subterra nean noises, called Moodus noises. The Indian name of the town was Mackimoodus, which in English is the place of noises; a name given with the utmost propriety to ihe place. The accounts given of the noises and quakings there are very remarka ble. Were it not that the people are accustomed to them, they would occasion great alarm. The Rev. Mr. Hosmer, in a letter to Mr. Prince, of Boston, written August 13th, 1729, gives this account of them: \u2014 'As to the earthquakes, I have something considerable and awful to tell you. Earthquakes have been here, (and no where but in this precinct, as can be discerned ; that is, they seem to have their center, rise and origin among us,) as has been observed for more than thirty years. I have been in formed, that in this place, before the English settlements, there were great numbers of Indian inhabitants, and that it was a place of extraordinary Indian Pawaws, or in short, that it was a place where the Indians drove a prodigious trade at worshipping the devil. Also I was informed, lhat, many years past, an old Indian was asked, What was the reason of the noises in this place! To which he replied, that the In dian's God was very angry because Englishman's God was come here. \" Now whether there be any thing diabolical in these things, I know not ; but this I know, that God Almighty is to be seen and trembled at, in what has been often heard among us. Whether it be fire or air distressed in the subterraneous caverns of the earth, cannot be known ; for there is no eruption, no explosion perceptible, but by sounds and tremors, which sometimes are very fearful and dreadful. I have myself heard eight or ten sounds successively, and imitating small arms, in the space of five minutes. I have, I suppose, heard several hundreds of them within twenty years some more, some less terrible. Sometimes we have heard them almost every day and great numbers of them in the space of a year. Oftentimes I have observed them to be coming down from the north, imitating slow thunder, until the sound came near or right under, and then there seemed to be a breaking, like the noise of a cannon shot, or severe thunder, which shakes the houses and all that is in them. They have"], [551, "EAST HADDAM. 527 South view of Mount Tom and the mouth of Salmon River. in a manner ceased since the great earthquake. As I remember, there have been but two heard 6ince that time, and those but moderate.\" A worthy gentleman, about six years since, gave the following account of them. \" The awful noises, of which Mr. Hosmer gave an account, in his historical minutes, and concerning which you desire further information, continue to the present time. The effects they produce, are various as the intermediate degrees between the roar of a cannon and the noise of a pistol. The concussions of the earth, made at the same time, are as much diversified as the sounds in the air. The shock they give to a dwelling house, is the same as the falling of logs on the floor. The smaller shocks produced no emotions of terror or fear in the minds of the inhabitants. They are spoken of as usual occurrences, and are called Moodus noises. But when they are so violent as to be felt in the adjacent towns, they are called earthquakes. During my residence here, which has been almost thirty six years, 1 have invariably observed, afier some of the most violent of these shocks, that an account has been published in the newspapers, of a small shock of an earthquake, at New London and Hartford. Nor do I believe, in all that period, there has been any account published of an earth quake in Connecticut, which was not far more violent here than in any other place. By recurring to the newspapers, you will find, that an earthquake was noticed on the 18th May, 1791, about 10 o'clock, P. M. It was perceived as far distant as Boston and New York. A few minutes after there was another shock, which was percepti ble at the distance of seventy miles. Here, at that time, the concussion of the earth, and the roariner of the atmosphere were most tremendous. Consternation and dread filled every house. Many chimnies were untopped and walls thrown down. It was a night much to be remembered ; for besides the two shocks which were noticed at a distance, during the night there was here a succession of shocks, to the number of twenty, perhaps thirty; the effects of which, like all others, decreased in every direc tion, in proportion to the distances. The next day, stones of several tons weight, were found removed from iheir places; and apertures in the earth, and fissures in im movable rocks, ascertained the places where the explosions were made. Since that time, the npises and shocks have been less frequent than before; though not a year passeth over us, but some of them are perceptible.\" \u2014 Trumbull's Hist. Con. Mount Tom is situated at the junction of Moodus with Salmon river. The above view was taken from the western side of Connecticut river. Mount Tom is the most elevated height seen in the distance, in the center of the engraving, at the base of which is seen a flat bottomed boat, ascending Salmon river. This mountain seems to be situated about the center from which the Moodus noises proceed. The sever-"], [552, "528 EAST HADDAM. est shocks are felt as far northeast as Boston, and as far southwest as New York, and are there noticed as earthquakes. In 1816 and 1817, in the night, these noises were more than usually violent. A person was on Mount Tom about 15 years since, at the time these noises were heard. It appeared to this person as though a stone or large body fell, underneath the ground, directly under his feet, and grated down to a considerable distance in the depths below. The cause of these noises is explained by some to be mineral or chemical combinations, exploding at a depth of many thousand feet beneath the surface of the earth. The jar is similar to that of exploded gunpowder. Upwards of a mile north osthe Landing is the ancient burying ground, which is situated about 40 rods southeasterly from Salmon river. It is now abandoned, and a sorest has grown up among the monuments, giving the place a very unusual and gloomy aspect. The following is copied from a moss-covered tabular monument : Under this tomb stone lyeth interr'd the body of the Rev. Stephen Hosmer, Ihe first pastor of the First Church of Christ in East Haddam, who departed this life the 18th day of June, A. D. 1749, and in the 70th year of his age. And at his right hand lyeth Mrs. Sarah Hosmer, his beloved consort, who departed this life Sept. ye 30th, A. D. 1749, and in the 67th year of her age. Sweet souls, we leave you to your rest; Enjoy your Jesus and your God, Till we from bands of clay releas'd, Spring out and climb ihe shining road. The following is from the 7th vol. of the Medical Repository, pub lished in New York, extracted from a letter written in East Haddam. \" For 10 or 12 years prior to 1797,\" says the writer, \" a disease prevailed among the cattle in East Haddam, and in the neighboring places to a great extent, vulgarly call ed a mortification. It was most destructive to cattle under three years; sometimes attacking cows over that period, but never oxen. Calves were most generally de stroyed by it in autumn, and yearlings in May and June. Its commencement was indi cated by a sudden listlessness, numbness, and disposition to rest, attended with small soft swellings on the legs, shoulders, flank, side, but more usually in the back near the kidneys, and it produced death with feeble expressions of pain, within 6, 12 and 24 hours. Immediately upon death, the carcass became intolerably offensive, so that the hide was often left to rot with it; where it was taken off, the swellings were found to consist of jelly and black blood. Aster tanning, the hide was often rotted over the swellings, and holes were made of their size and dimensions.\" The cause of this dis ease was never satisfactorily ascertained and the remedies which were applied, rarely, if ever succeeded.* From the Connecticut Gazette, (New London,) Aug. 20, 1790. No. 1397. East Haddam, Aug. 5, 1790. The town of East Haddam was formerly much noted for earthquakes \u2014 from which it obtained its ancient Indian name, Moodus; which in their language, it is said, sig nifies a great noise. They were supposed to take their rise near Salmon river which runs between this town and Chatham. Several years ago, they were said to be very loud and frequent, and that they shook the earth for several miles around ; and it has been reported that the ground has been opened in several places, and trees torn up by the roots, and carried to some distance, near the above mentioned river-\u2014 and that some persons were under fearful apprehensions that the lown would sooner or later be sunk. Various have been the conjectures concerning the cause of these' earthquakes or Moodus noises, as they are called. The following account has gained credit with many persons.-It is reported that between 20 and 30 years ago, a transient person came to this town, who called himself Doct. Steel, from Great Britain who havin- * Field's Statist. Hist, of the County of Middlesex"], [553, "529 KILLING W OUT II. had information respecting those noises, made critical observation at different times and in different places, till at length he dug up two pearls of great value, which he called Carbuncles, near Salmon river:\u2014 and that he told people the noises would be discontinued for many years, as he had taken away their cause; but as he had dis covered others in miniature, they would be again heard in process of time. The best evidence of the authenticity of this story is that it has happened agreeably to his pro phecy. The noises did cease for many years, and have again been heard for two or three years past, and they increase\u2014 three shocks have been felt in a short space, one of which according lo a late paper, was felt at New London, though it was by the ac count much more considerable in this and the adjacent towns. KILLING WORTH. In October, 1663, the legislature of Connecticut resolved that there should be a town at Hammonnasset, (the Indian name applied to the tract now constituting Killingworth,) and the same month'twelve plant ers removed into it. These were joined by sixteen others in the course of two or three years; and the town was divided into 30 rights, one right being reserved for the first minister that should be settled there, and another for the support of the ministry forever. \" The plantation in this town was called the plantation of Hammonnasset, and the plan tation between Guilford and Saybrook, until May, 1667. At that time the place was named Kenihvorth, after a town in the county of War wick, in England, from which, according to tradition, some of the set tlers at first emigrated. The name is thus spelt in the early records of the town and colony, but by corrupt spelling or pronunciation, the pre sent name was finally adopted.\" The township of Killingworth is of an oblong shape, being about 13 miles in length from north to south, and has \u25a0& mean breadth of more than three miles. It is bounded n. by Durham and Haddam, w. by Hammonnasset river, dividing it from Madison, e. by Saybrook and Chester, and s. by Long Island sound. It comprises two parishes, viz. Killingworth, and North Killingworth. The central part of Killing worth is 38 miles southeast from Hartford, 25 miles east from New Haven, and 27 west from New London. The southern, and particularly the southwestern section of Killingworth parish, is level, having a soil formed of loam, sand, and occasionally of gravel, which, by good hus bandry, is rendered very productive. Upon the border of the Sound, there are large tracts of alluvial or salt marsh, comprising, as has been estimated, 1,000 acres. North Killingworth is rough and stony, and the soil better adapted for grazing, than for grain and corn. There is one harbor in the town, about a mile below Killingworth street which is safe from winds, and has good anchorage ; but a bar lies at its entrance, on which there is only 7\u00a3 or 8 feet of water at common tides. Ship building was begun in this town about the begin ning osthe last century, by Robert Carter; and for many years this has been a leading branch of business. Three yards are improved, all of which are on Indian river, a small stream which enters the harbor. There are, perhaps, five vessels built yearly, upon an average. One of upwards 400 tons was built in this place. The village of Killingworth P 67"], [554, "530 KILLINGWORTH. is quite pleasant. The principal street is a mile and a half in length and six rods wide, and is crossed about midway by Indian river. There are, perhaps, about 150 dwelling houses within a mile from the Con gregational church, which is situated in the central part of the place : there is also in the village a Methodist and Baptist church. Killing worth has a healthful, interesting, and prospective situation, and has during the summer months, a salubrious sea air. \" The Indians were very numerous in the southern part of this town, on the banks of Hammonnasset and Indian rivers, and about the harbor. Immense masses ot mouldering shells still point out the places where they dwelt. Most of their lands were sold to Col. Fenwick, while he lived at Saybrook. On the 20th of November, 1669, Uncas, Sachem of Mohegan, with Joshua his son, sold to the inhabitants of Killingworth all the lands in the township, which he had not sold before to George Fenwick, Esq. excepting six acres on the big hammock, (which lay on the eastern shore of ihe harbor,) reserving, however, free liberty to hunt in the woods, and fish in the rivers, and to use any trees for canoes, and rushes and slags for mats.\" \" The In dians lived in this town in great numbers until 1730 or 40.\" West view of Killingworth, (central part.) The above is a view (looking eastward) of the central part of the principal street in Killingworth, showing the place where the road crosses Indian river, with part of the ship yards upon its banks. The Congregational church, seen in the center of the print, stands upon a small elevation, called Meeting-house hill : the academy is seen at the east end of the church : from this place the observer has a pleasant view of the harbor and Sound. The prospect from the steeple is more extensive and beautiful. On the right is seen, between the trees and opposite the church, a house upwards of an hundred years old. This house was the residence of the Rev. Jared Elliot, D. D. who was highly distinguished as a divine, physician, and scholar. He was the grandson of the celebrated John Elliot of Roxbury, Massachusetts, the \" Apostle to the Indians.\" As a divine, Mr. Elliot possessed enlarged views of the systern of religion contained in the Bible. \" In his preaching he was plain and familiar, happy in allusions to Scripture,"], [555, "531 KILLINGWORTH. and abounding in original and laconic expressions. Asa physician, his reputation was such, that he was sometimes called out of the colony. In history, natural philosophy, botany and mineralogy, he excelled. By several small treatises, he labored to improve the agriculture of his country. Some considerations had led him to believe that the black sand, which appears originally on the beach of the Sound, might be wrought into iron. He made an experiment upon it in the year 1761, and succeeded. For this discovery he was honored with a medal, by the society instituted in London for the encouragement of arts, manu factures and commerce. He died in 1763, aged seventy eight years.\" A short distance northward of the church seen in the engraving is the burying ground. The following inscription is copied from one of the monuments. \" In memory of Doct. Benjamin Gale, who, after a life of usefulness in his profes sion, and a laborious study osthe Prophesies, fell asleep May 6lh, A. D. 1790, \u00c6t. 75, fully expecting to rise again under the Messiah, and to reign with him on earth I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth, and mine eyes shall behold him.\" It appears by this inscription, that Dr. Gale was a believer in the an cient doctrine of Millenarians, a name given to those who believe that the second coming of Christ will precede the Millennium, and that there will be a literal resurrection osthe saints, who will reign with Christ on earth a thousand years. This appears to have been the belief of pious persons at the time of the first settlement of New England : even as late as the great earthquake, many Christians were looking for, and ex pecting the second coming of Christ. Abel B ucll, an uncommonly ingenious mechanic, was a native of this town : he was apprenticed to Ebenezer Chittenden, a gold and silver smith in this place, previ ous to the Revolution. Buell was married at the age of nineteen years, and at the age of twenty, altered a five shilling colony note to five pounds. His neighbors had suspected that something was going on in his house which was wrong, as a light had been seen in his chamber, at unusual hours of the night. He was discovered by some person, who, mounting a ladder, looked in at the window, and saw him in the act of altering the bills. So ingeniously was it done, that it could only be discovered by comparing the stumps osthe letters with those left in the book from which all the col ony bills were issued.* Matthew Griswold, the king's attorney, afterwards governor, conducted the prosecution against Buell. As it was his first offense, and he otherwise sustained a good character, Mr. Griswold granted him every indulgence which he could consistently with his duty as a public officer. Bnell's punishment appears to have consisted of imprisonment, cropping and branding. The tip only of Buell's ear was cropped off: it was held on his longue to keep it warm till it was put on the ear a\u00bbain where it grew on. He was branded on the forehead as high up as possible. This was'usually done by a hot iron, in the form of a letter designating the crime, which was held on ihe lorehead of the criminal till he could say the words \" God save the king.\" Mr. Buell was at the first imprisoned at Norwich ; afterwards, through the influence ofhis family and friends, he was removed back to Killingworth. About this time he constructed a lapidary machine, the first, it is believed, that was used in this country. With this he was enabled to make a very curious ring ; a large, beautiful stone being set in the center, surrounded by those of a smaller size, all of which were wrought in a curious and workmanlike manner. This ring he presented to Mr. Griswold, the king's attorney, and through his influence a pardon was obtained. Afterwards, about * It appears from this that all the bills which were issued by the colony were origin ally bound together in the form of a book, and were cut out as they were wanted, leav ing some pars of the printed matter in the book."], [556, "532 S AYBROO K. the year 1770 Mr. Buell removed to New Haven. About this period, Bernard Ro mans was constructing a map of North America. As the coast of Pensacola was but little known, Buell was employed by him to make a survey of the coast. While at Pensacola a person, knowing him to be an ingenious man, enquired if he could break the governor's seal, and open a letter and seal it up again, so that it could not be dis covered that the letter had been opened. Mr. Buell was able to show his employer that it could be done in a perfect manner. He was, however, arrested for making the attempt, although it is believed that the governor employed the person who came to Buell. He was confined to the island, but he soon found means 10 escape, by a boat ot his construction: he was accompanied by a boy who wished to leave ihe place; they put out into the open sea, and were three clays out of sight of land. I hey however were able to get into some of our southern ports, and from thence Buell returned home. The map mentioned above was published during the Revolutionary war, and it is believed to be the first map engraved and published in this country. In engraving it, Mr. Buell was assisted by Mr. Amos Doolittle, of New Haven. During the Revolu tion it was extremely difficult to procure types for printing, except French types. Mr. Buell lurnin\u00b0- his attention to this subject, soon constructed a type foundery, and em ployed 15 or 20 boys in making types. The building used for the foundery was the Sandemanian meeting house, situated in Gregson street. The legislature of the state impressed with a sense of the service he rendered the public, restored to him his c'ivil rights. Upon the conclusion of the Revolutionary war, Mr. Buell and some others were employed by the state in coining coppers. Mr. Buell constructed all the apparatus for this purpose, and to such perfection did he bring it, lhat he was able to coin 120 in a minute. Soon aster, he went to England, for the ostensible purpose of procuring copper for coining, but in reality to gain some knowledge ol the machinery used for the manufacturing of cloths of various kinds. While in England, he was passing through a town where they were constructing an iron bridge : through some error or defect in the construction, the builders could not make their bridge answer any useful purpose. Such was Mr. Buell's knowledge and ingenuity on subjects of this nature, that he was able in a short time to direct ihem how to construct their bridge in a proper manner. So highly were his services con sidered, fhat he was presented with a hundred guineas. Mr. Buell returned to this country, and brought a Scotchman by the name of M'Intosh. They erected a cotton factory in Westville, in New Haven, one of the first erected in this country. He afterwards removed to Hartford, and from thence to Stockbridge, Mass, where he made a profession of religion after he was seventy years of age. About the year 1825, he returned to New Haven, where he died in the alms house soon after his relurn. SAYBROOK. Saybrook is one of the most ancient towns in the state. Lord Say and Seal, Lord Brook, and other gentlemen of distinction, dissatisfied with the civil and religious state of things in England, in the time of Charles I, contemplated a removal to America : accordingly, in 1632, they procured of Robert, Earl of Warwick, a patent of all that terri tory \" which lies west from Narragansett river, a hundred and twenty miles on the sea coast ; and from thence in latitude and breadth afore said, to the South Sea.\" In July, 1635, they appointed John Winthrop, son of the governor of Massachusetts, then in England, their agent, to build a fort at Connecticut river, and constituted him governor'of the the place and places adjoining, for the space of one year from his arri val there. On his arrival at Boston in October, he found that a com pany had just gone from Massachusetts and settled upon Connecticut river, within the patent held by their lordships. Winthrop however dispatched carpenters and workmen to the mouth of the Connecticut, who arrived there at or near the close of November, 1635. Mr. Win throp soon followed them, and superintended their labors during the continuance of his commission."], [557, "533 SAYBROOK. In the summer of 1639, Col. George Fenwick, one of the patentees, arrived from England, and in honor of Lord Say and Seal, and Lord Brook, gave the tract about the mouth of the river, the name of Say brook. From this time, to December, 1644, he superintended and governed the inhabitants, and then sold the jurisdiction of Saybrook to Connecticut colony ; as his associates had given up their contemplated removal to America. The first tax levied by authority of the colony, was at the October session, the year after. Soon after this period, the settlement began to flourish ; a number of families removing here from Hartford and Windsor. The original limits of the town extended upon the east side of the river for several miles, and included a part of the town of Lyme. The township now comprises three parishes, viz. Say brook, Westbrook, Pautapoug or Essex. Saybrook parish is the south east section of the town. The Indian name for this place was Patta quasset. West of this is Westbrook parish, which was called by its In dian name Pochaug, until October, 1810. North of these two par ishes is Pautapoug or Essex. Saybrook is bounded n. by Chester, w. by Killingworth, e. by Con necticut river, and s. by Long Island sound. It is upwards of 7 miles in length from north to south, and averages more than 6 in breadth. The greater part of the township is uneven and stony. There are, how ever, some extensive levels, and tracts of rich soil, particularly in the vicinity of Saybrook village, in the southern part of the town. Some of the hills, near Connecticut river, have good granite quarries. There are several small harbors on the Sound, and on Connecticut river, at Saybrook point and Pautapoug. The bar at the mouth of the Connec ticut is an impediment to navigation ; vessels of a moderate draught are often obliged to pass it with but part of their cargoes. The depth of water at the bar, at spring tides, is about twelve feet. An important and lucrative trade was formerly carried on from this river, to the West Indies, and New London often served in some degree as the port. Say brook harbor is at the mouth of a handsome cove, making up from Connecticut river, and extending west almost to Saybrook village. It is often resorted to by coasting vessels in bad weather. To this place the river is open through the winter, and it is here that vessels are fre quently laid up, and goods deposited, while the river is frozen over above. Large quantities of fish are taken in this town. The shad fish eries are numerous, and a source of considerable wealth. Connecticut river shad are considered superior to any other in this country. White fish are taken upon the shores of the Sound, and are very valuable for the purposes of manure. They are afforded at a cheap rate ; the light est soils, enriched by them, have produced forty bushels of rye to the acre, and they have an equally advantageous effect upon the growth of corn, potatoes, and other productions. The borough of Essex, in the town of Saybrook, is situated about 7 miles from the mouth of Connecticut river. It is a place of considera- ble navigation and commercial business, containing about 1,000 inhab- itants. Ship building is also carried on to a considerable extent. In this place there are three houses of worship, an academy, 8 or 10 met-"], [558, "534 saybrook. Northeast view of the Borough of Essex, Saybrook. cantile stores, 6 sail makers, and one of the most extensive rope walks in the state. Ship building was begun in this place about 1720, by Mr. John Tucker. In 1775, the ship Oliver Cromwell, of 24 guns, was built at this place, by Mr. Uriah Hayden. The accompanying view was taken from the long causeway eastward of the place, and shows the appearance of the public buildings, the rope walk, and part osthe houses on the point. The building on the extreme right is Hill's Academy, where are taught the higher branches of education ; that standing opposite is the Baptist church. The building near the center with a spire is the Episcopal, and the one near by is the Methodist church. From these buildings there is an abrupt descent to the strip of land between two coves, (called the North and South coves:) this point, formerly called Pettipaug Point, extends 100 rods in a south erly direction. Most of the buildings in the borough are on this point. During the last war with Great Britain, this place was visited by an ar manent from the British squadron blockading New London, in April, 1814. Vessels from the squadron had often gone out and cruised in the Sound. \" On the evening following the 7th of April, two or three of these anchored off Say brook bar. They immediately dispatched for Pautapoug, two launches, each carry ing 9 or 12 pound carronades and fifty or sixty men each, and four barges, supposed to have 25 men each, under the command of Lieut. Coote, completely prepared with torches, combustibles, &c. for the enterprise which they accomplished. Before 11 o'clock they were discovered entering the mouth of ihe river, by the keeper of ihe light house, and before 12, many of the men landed ai Saybrook point, and went into the old fort, where no force was then stationed to resist them. The distance from this place to Pautapoug point is between five and six miles; but being retarded by a strong northerly wind and a freshet, they did not arrive there till about four o'clock, Friday morning, the 8th of April. The people knew nothing of their being in the river more than 30 minutes before they arrived, and look possession of the point ; and some had no knowledge ot it, before the work of conflagration was begun. Picket guards searched houses and stores for arms and ammunition while the men Generally were employed in setting fire to the vessels, lying in the river, at the point, and on the stocks along the North and South coves. About 10 o'clock, they called in their guards and proceeded down the river, with a brig, schooner, and two sloops. But the wind shifting from ihe northeast to the southeast, they set fire to all these, excepting the"], [559, "535 SAYBROOK. schooner, which they anchored about a mile and a quarter below the point, where they remained till evening. Twenty two vessels of various descriptions were destroy ed, and a loss occasioned, computed at 160,000 dollars, 60,000 of which fell on the in habitants of Pautapoug. \" When the enemy first landed, the people living on the point and in the vicinity were in no situation to oppose them. In the course of the day, some forces collected from Pautapoug and other places west of Ihe river; while on the east side, some col lected from Lyme and New London ; but the work of destruction was finished and the British were more than a mile down the river. The plan adopted was to oppose them on their way out, for which stations were taken on both sides. But the enemy were detained as has been staled. About sunset a field piece was planted on a point near their resting place, which, by several well directed shots, compelled them to leave the schooner. One of these shots killed two men and wounded a third. When night came on, it was excessively dark, and no object could be seen, and they proceeded si lently down the river, and arrived at their vessels about 10 o'clock in the evening. Many shots were directed againsl them on the supposition of their being on their way, some of which struck their boats, and probably did some execution.\"* The village of Westbrook is about four miles west from Saybrook village. The settlement of this place commenced as early as 1664. It was incorporated as a society in 1724. The Rev. William Worthing ton was their first pastor; he deceased in 1756, and was succeeded by the Rev. John Devotion. Ship building was commenced in 1740, on the Pochaug river, and is still a leading branch of business in the place. There are at present about 15 vessels owned here, principally coasters. It is estimated that there are about 1,200 inhabitants in the limits of the society, and two churches, 1 Congregational and 1 Methodist. Mr. David Bushnell, the inventor of the \" American Turtle,\" a machine for destroying British shipping, during the Revolutionary war, was a native of this place. There were formerly in the town four Indian settlements ; one at the mouth of Oyster river ; one on Obed's hammock, near the mouth of Pochaug river; a third was at Ayres's point, and so northward to Pau tapoug point ; the fourth was on or near the Indian reservation in Ches ter. The Indians in this town and vicinity were subject, some years before the English settled on Connecticut river, to the Pequots. In 1634, some of their confederates murdered Capt. Stone and Capt. Nor ton, and their whole crew, consisting of eight men, half a mile above Saybrook point, plundered the vessel, then burned her down to the wa ter's edge, and sunk her.f In 1635, they received and protected in dividuals who had been concerned in the murder of Mr. Oldham, at Block Island. \" But notwithstanding these recent and abominable transactions, they consented to hold a treaty with Mr. Winlhrop and his men, and gave to the English their right to Connecticut river and the adjacent country. Thus they excited a hope of peace and safely But a few months, according to the testimony of Dr. Trumbull and various other writers, disclosed their treachery and wickedness. For in the beginning of Oc tober 1636, as five men from Saybrook fort went to get hay at Calves' island, four miles' north, near Lyme shore, some Pequots who had concealed themselves in the hi<*h grass surprised them, caught one, a godly young man, by ihe name of Butter field and tortured him to death : from which circumstance the place was named But terfield's meadow. The other four escaped to their boat, but one of them was wounded with 5 arrows.\u2014 A few days after this, Joseph Tilly, master of a bark, came to anchor * Field's Statistical Account. t As late as 1785, some of the timber and plank of this vessel were found, together with a quantity of bar iron, and a few olher articles.\u2014 Field's Slat. Acct. Saybrook."], [560, "536 SAYBROOK. nearly opposite Calves' island, and taking one man with him, went on shore for the purpose of fowling. As soon as he had discharged his piece, a large number of Pe quots rising from their concealment, took him and killed his companion ; and hen gratified their malice by putting him to torture. They first cut off his hands and hen his feet; after which he lived three days. But as nothing which they inflicted upon him excited a groan, they pronounced him a stout man The place where he was taken and tortured has since been called Tilly's Point.-Within a fortnight of these transactions, the following calamity was experienced. A house had been erected about two miles from the fort, (at Cornfield point, as it is supposed,) and six men de tached from the garrison 10 keep it. As three of them were fowling near the house, (a practice which the lieutenant Lad strictly forbid,) they were suddenly attacked by nearly one hundred Pequots : two were taken, and one fought his way through mem sword in hand, wounded with two arrows, but not mortally.\u2014 The following winter the fort was little better than in a slate of constant siege. None could go lrom it without hazard ; and the cattle, stacks of hay, and almost every thing belonging to it at any distance, were destroyed. When the spring arrived, the enemy were still more troublesome. As Lieut. Gardiner was going out in the month of March, with ten or twelve men, to burn the marshes, the enemy rose upon them just as they had turned south from the palisades, killed three of the men and wounded a fourth so that he died in the fort the next day. The Lieutenant was slightly wounded but was able with most of his men to retreat. Encouraged by this success, the Indians followed them surrounded the fort, and challenged them to fight; mocking them in the groans and pious invocations of their friends whom they had tortured ; till a dexterous use of the guns, loaded with grape shot, compelled them to retire. Aster this, Indians in several canoes beset a shallop, having three men on board, as it was sailing down the river They shot one of them through the head with an arrow, who fel overboard. The other two they took and ripped ihem from the bottom ol their bellies to their throats, cleft them down their backs, and then suspended them on trees by the side ot the river that the English might behold these objects of their vengeance. One ol the Indians concerned in these barbarities was Nepaupuck, a famous Pequot captain who for this and other murders was beheaded at New Haven, in 1639, and whose head was set upon a pole in the market place.\"* South view of Lady Fenwick's Monument on Saybrook Point. The above is a representation osthe monument of the wife of Col.

Her monument is about 30 or 40 rods southwest from the remains of the fort, and perhaps five or six rods from the river, on a piece of elevated ground, called \"tomb hill,\" probably so named from the circumstance of this monument being placed upon its summit. It is said that Col. Fenwick made provision to have it kept in perpetual re pair, it being one of the considerations for which he gave a deed to a large tract of land on the opposite side of the river. If this be a fact, the condition osthe deed has been but illy complied with, and it is to be regretted that no more care has been taken to preserve the memo rial of this respectable lady, it being, it is believed, the oldest monu ment for a female in the state. It is of coarse sandstone, and no in scription has been seen upon it within the recollection of the oldest in habitants of the place. There is, however, something of the resem blance of A. B. on the end of one osthe upright stones on the western side, but whether formed by the hand of man, or by the wear of time, it is difficult to ascertain. The monument of this lady stands on a bleak and exposed situation : \" The dark brown years\" have passed over it; she sleeps alone far from the land of her fathers, \"at the noise osthe sounding surge! Her tomb is seen by the mariner as he passes by on the dark rolling wave.\" Saybrook fort, however it may be regarded at the present time, was formerly a post of great importance. A garrison was constantly kept here for a very long period, and the fort was usually well manned in seasons of war and danger, as it commanded the entrance of Connecti cut river. It was first built of wood, in front or on the point of Tomb hill. But as this in some unaccountable manner took fire in the winter of 1647, and was consumed, with some adjoining buildings, the fort was rebuilt soon after of more substantial materials, and placed a few rods further north, on what was called New-fort hill, the place on which the remains are now standing. A few days after the first fort was be gun, in 1635, a Dutch vessel arrived from New Netherlands, with a view of taking possession of the mouth of the river and of laying the foundation of a settlement. The English having mounted two pieces of cannon, prevented their landing, and defeated the enterprise. This fort, also, about the time of the Pequot war, saved the inhabitants of Saybrook from being cut off by the Indians. \" In the year 1675, it was discovered that Major Andross was about to make a hostile invasion of the colony, and to demand a surrender of its most important posts to the government of the Duke of York. Detachments from the militia were there fore sent, with the utmost expedition, to New London and Saybrook. Captain Thomas Bull, of Hartford, commanded the party sent to Saybrook. \" About the 8th or 9th of July, the people of that town were surprised by the appear ance of Major Andross, with an armed force, in the Sound, making directly for the sort. They had received no intelligence of the affair, nor instructions from the gov ernor and council how to conduct themselves upon such an emergency. They were, at first undetermined whether lo make any resistance or not ; but they did not hesitate Ion\" As the danger approached and their suprise abated, the martial spirit began to enkindle ; the fort was manned, and the militia of the town drawn out for its de fense. At this critical juncture, Captain Bull wilh his company arrived, and the most vigorous exertions were made for the defense of the fort and town. On the 1 1th, Major Andross with several armed sloops drew up before the fort, hoisted the king's flag on board, and demanded a surrender of the fortress and town. Captain Bull 68"], [562, "538 SAYBROOK. raised his majesty's colors in ibe fort, and arranged his men in the best manner. They appeared with a good countenance, determined and eager for action. The Major did not like to fire on the king's colors, and perceiving that should he attempt lo reduce the town by force, it would be a bloody affair, judged it expedient not to hie upon the troops. He nevertheless lay all that day, and part of the next, off against the fort. The critical state of the colony had occasioned the meeting of the Assembly, at Hart ford, on the 9th of July. They immediately proceeded to draw up a declaration, or protest. * , * * * Which was sent by an express lo Saybrook, with instructions to Captain Bull, to propose to Major Andross the reference of the affair in dispute to commissioners, to meet in anyplace in this colony which he should choose. Early in the morning of the 12th of July, the Major desired that he might have admittance on shore, and an interview with the ministers and chief officers. He probably imagined, that if he could read the duke's patent and his own commission, it would make an impression upon Ihe people, and that he should gain that by art, which he could not by force ofarms. He was allowed to come on shore with his suit. Meanwhile, the express arrived with the protest and instructions from the Assembly. Captain Bull and his officers, with the officers and gentlemen of the town, met the Major, at his landing, and acquainted him that they had, at that instant, received instructions to tender him a treaty, and to refer the whole matter in ihe contro rersy to commissioners, capable of determining it according to law and justice. The Major rejected the proposal, and forthwith commanded, in his majesty's name, that the duke's patent, and the commission which he had/eceived from his royal high ness, should be read. Captain Bull commanded him, in his majesty's name, to forbear reading. When his clerk attempted to persist in reading, the Captain repeated his command with such energy of voice, and meaning in his countenance, as convinced the Major it was not safe to proceed. The Captain then acquainted him, that he had an address from ihe Assembly to him, and read ihe protest. Gov. Andross, pleased with his bold and soldier-like appearance, said, \" What's your name '.\" He replied, \" My name is Bull, sir.\" \" Bull,\" said the governor, \" it is a pity that your horns are not tipped with silver.\" Finding that he could make no impression upon the officers or people, and that the legislature of ihe colony were determined lo defend themselves, in the possession of their chartered rights, he gave up his design of seizing the fort. He represented the protest as a slender affair, and an ill requital of his kindness. He said, however, he should do no more. The militia of the town guarded him to his boat, and going on board he soon sailed for Long Island.* Saybrook point is a peninsula, circular in its form, and connected with the main land by a narrow neck, over which the tide sometimes flows. From this place to the fort, on the eastern extremity of the pe ninsula, the distance is about one mile. On the neck, a palisado was anciently formed from the river to the cove, to secure Saybrook point from any sudden incursion of the Indians. The soil on the peninsula is light and sandy, and the elevation osthe highest part is about twenty feet. Being nearly destitute of trees and shrubbery, it presents to the beholder a bleak and naked aspect. The land on the Point was laid out with care, as it was expected to become the residence of great men, and the center of great business and wealth. It is said that Oliver Cromwell, with other men then equally distinguished, actually embarked in the Thames, to occupy this ground. Westward of the fort a square was laid out, on which it was intended houses should be erected for Cromwell, Pymm, Hasselrig, and Hampden, the most illustrious Commoners in the English annals, who were expected from Europe ; while a square still further west was reserved for public uses. About halfway between the palisado was erected the first building designed for the collegiate school, since named Yale College. This building was one story in height, and about eighty feet in length. Some * Trumbull':, History of Connecticut."], [563, "539 SAYBROOK. remains of the cellar, \" over which the ploughshare has passed,\" are still visible. Fifteen commencements were held at Saybrook. More than sixty young men were graduated, most of whom entered the min istry, and some of them became characters of distinguished usefulness and excellence. To educate young men of piety and talents for the ministry, was the leading design of this institution. It was desired by the sounders and others, that the churches should have a public stand ard or confession of faith, agreeable to which the instruction of the college should be conducted. This led to the adoption of the Saybrook Platform, after the commencement in 1708. The removal of the college from this place to New Haven, produced great excite ment in the colony of Connecticut. The feelings raised in the towns most interested, may be gathered from the circumstances attending the removal of the library. \" An unsuccessful application having been made for this by some of the trustees, the Gov ernor and council convened in Saybrook at their request, in December, 1718 ; and issued a warrant to the sheriff to go and take the books. When he got to the house where they were kept, he found men collected to resist him; but calling assistance, he forcibly entered the house, took them, and had them secured by a guard through the night. In the morning it appeared that the carts provided for carrying them to New Haven were broken, and the horses turned away. New provision being made, they were conducted out of the town bv the major of the county ; but some of ihe bridges on the road were broken up, and when they arrived in New Haven, it was discovered, on counting the books, lhat about 260 were wanting. These were disposed of by per sons unknown, together with some valuable papers, in the confusion which arose at the taking of the library, and no discovery was made of them afterwards.\" Names of the freemen in Saybrook, 1669.

Tolland County was incorporated as such in 1786. It was formed from Hartford and Windham Counties. It is bounded n. by Massa chusetts, e. by Windham County, s. by New London County, and w. by Hartford County. It is irregular in its form. Its greatest length from north to soutli is about 30 miles. At the north part it is nearly 20 miles in breadth ; at its southern extremity it is but five miles in breadth. Tolland County, as it respects its surface, soil, &tc. may be divided into two distinct sections, the eastern and western. The west ern section, lying within the great valley of the Connecticut, is a hand some level or undulating country. This tract is generally free from stone, and the soil, though somewhat light, is warm, fertile and pro ductive, and well adapted to the growth of grain. The eastern section, which embraces the largest portion of the county, is within the granitic range which extends through the state. A considerable proportion of forest lands still remain in this part of the county. The improved lands afford tolerable good grazing, but are not very well adapted for a grain culture. The manufacturing interests of the county are respecta ble and flourishing. The following is a list of the towns, with their population in 1830.

TOLLAND. Tolland was originally purchased of the native Indians by a num ber of gentlemen in Windsor. In 1715 it was incorporated by the As sembly, and the settlement of the town was commenced by two fami lies. The progress of the settlement was slow ; the number of families in 1720 was but twenty eight. About one half of the township, com prising the south part, was claimed by a number of persons who were legatees of Joshua Uncas, sachem of the Mohegans. This proved a source of considerable difficulty, as the legatees commenced suits at law against the settlers. The proprietors holding under the Windsor claim ants were obliged, at a dear rate, to purchase quit claims of the lega tees of Joshua. The Rev. Stephen Steel was the first minister of this town. He commenced his labors in 1720, and continued his ministry for about thirty seven years, greatly beloved and revered by his peo ple. Mr. Steel was from Hadley, Mass. The first settlers were of the names of Chapman, Steams, Grant, West, Carpenter, Aborns, Abbot, Lathrop, Nye and Dimock. The Chapmans were from Windsor ; they located themselves about 2\u00a3 miles westerly torn the court house,"], [565, "541 TOLLAND. near the Hartford road, in the vicinity of Snipsic pond or lake. John Steams settled about 2 miles eastward of the court house ; Zebulon West about 3 miles south ; the Govers, Carpenters and Samuel Aborns, located about 2\u00a3 miles north. Ebenezer Grant, from East Windsor, settled on Grant's hill, about g\u00a3 miles south from the court house ; Nye and Dimock settled near Willimantic river, about 4 miles east.

Tolland is bounded n. by a narrow section of land in Ellington, ex tending eastward, called \" the Equivalent,\" w. by Vernon and Elling ton, e. by the Willimantic river, dividing it from Willington, and s. by Coventry. It is upwards of six miles in length from north to south, and five and a half in breadth. The township is rough and uneven, being mountainous and stony, but some of the valleys and borders of streams consist of loam, which is warm and fertile. On the western boundary osthe town is a large body of water, called Snipsic pond, be ing two miles in length and 100 rods in width. Some osthe most val uable land in the township is in the vicinity of this pond. There is also a pond called Skungamug, in the central part of the town, upon which beavers were formerly taken by the Indians. Great quantities of cranberries are now gathered upon its borders. The village in the central part of this town consists of about forty well appearing houses, pleasantly situated on an elevated plain of about half a mile in extent from north to south, narrow, but of sufficient width for a wide street. This place is 18 miles east from Hartford, and 52 from New Haven.

The settlement of this town commenced about the year 1716, by a number of settlers, principally from the towns of Hartford, Windsor and Wethersfield. The first town meeting was held in 1720, the year it was incorporated. In 1725, the inhabitants obtained liberty of the General Assembly, to form a church. The first minister of the town was the Rev. Thomas White, who was ordained in 1725. The town is bounded n. by Vernon, w. by Manchester and Glasten bury, e. by Coventry, and s. by Hebron.

This range is near the boun dary line between Bolton and Vernon, and about 13 miles from Hart ford. This stone is a species of slate, of a brilliant light gray color, composed of mica and quartz, and is excellent for flagging and other purposes. It is extensively used in the principal cities of the United States. For strength it exceeds any other known in this country, and the demand for it is rapidly increasing. These quarries have been worked about twenty years, though not in an extensive manner till quite recently. Messrs. Apollos Sweetland, and Waterman Roberts, of Hartford, and Ahab Smith, and Isaac Keney, Jr. of Bolton, are the proprietors. Sweetland and Roberts, of Hartford, are agents for the concern. COLUMBIA.

It is bounded n. by Hop river, which separates it from Coventry, w. by Hebron, e. by Lebanon and Wind ham, and s. by Lebanon. It is about five miles long, and four wide. The central part of the town is twenty two miles east from Hartford. The township is uneven and hilly, and the soil is a coarse gravelly loam, being hard and dry, yet well adapted for' grazing. The town constitutes one Congregational society."], [568, "544 COLUMBIA. It was in this place that Dr. Eleazar Wheelock, the first president of Dartmouth College, had his celebrated Indian school. His house and the school stood a few rods from the present Congregational church. Dr. Wheelock was born in Windham, in April, 1711, and graduated at Yale College in 1733. Soon after leaving college, he entered into the ministry, and soon received an unanimous invitation to become the pastor of the second society in Lebanon, (now Columbia,) with which he complied. While a minister in this place, he became desirous to employ himself in a more ex tended field of action. The unhappy and neglected tribes of Indians in the county, and on its borders, excited his compassion and engaged his attention. About this time, (1741,) Sampson Occum, a serious Indian youth, solicited instruction, as Mr. Wheelock had opened a school for a small number of young men who were preparing for college. He willingly received young Occum into his family and school, where he continued for about three years. He afterwards became a preacher of considerable celebrity. Dr. Wheelock conceived, that if he could educate Indian youth for mis sionaries, they would be more successful among their countrymen than the whites. With these views, he undertook himself the care and expense of educating two Indian lads from the Delaware nation, in 1754, but the design was so benevolent, that a num ber of gentlemen soon united with him. His pupils increased, and after receiving numerous benefactions, the largest of which was the benefaction of Mr. Joshua Moor, of Mansfield, he called his institution \" Moor's Indian Charity School.\" In 1764, the school consisted of about thirty scholars, of whom about half were Indian youth. The Indian boys were accommodated in a part of the house given by Mr. Moor. The school house was nigh Mr. Wheelock's dwelling, in the hall of which the students and their instructors attended morning and evening prayers. To enlarge the power of doing good, contributions were solicited not only in various parts of this country, but also in England and Scotland. The money collected in England was put into the hands of a board of trustees, of whom the earl ot Dartmouth was at the head. From this circumstance, when Dr. Wheelock was invited by the government of New Hampshire to remove to Hanover and establish a college in that place, it was called Dartmouth College. This seminary was incorporated in 1769, and Dr. Wheelock was declared ils sounder and president, with the right of appointing his successor. In 1770, Dr. Wheelock removed his family and school to Hanover, his pupils per forming the tour on foot. The roads at that period were in a very rough and unfin ished state, and it was in many places difficult to proceed. The site selected for the college and other buildings, was an extensive plain, shaded by lofty pines, with no accommodations, except two or three small log huts, and no house on that side of the river within two miles, through one continued dreary wood. The number of sools then with him was about seventy. Log houses were soon constructed, and a small framed house was begun, designed for the reception of Dr. Wheelock and his family. The frame of a college, eighty feet in length and two stories in height, was soon after raised, and partially covered: a hall, and two or three rooms in it, were considerably advanced when the aulumnal storms commenced Upon a circular area of about six acres, the pines were soon felled , and in all directions covered the ground to the height of about five feet. Paths of communication were cut through them. . . . The snow lay four feet in depth between four and five months. \" Sometimes standing in the open air, at the head of his numerous family, Dr. Wheelock presented to God their morning and evening prayers : the surrounding forests, for the first time, rever berated the solemn sounds of supplication and praise.\"* He died in 1779, in the 69th year of his age, and was succeeded by his son in the presidency of the college. The following inscriptions are copied from monuments in the burying ground, near the Congregational church in Columbia. Sacred to the memory of Mrs. Sarah, the wife of ye Rev'd Eleazer Wheelock, who died Nov. 13, A. D. 1746, and in the 44th yr. of her age ; and of a character too great and good, to have any thing worthy of it inscribed here. Sacred to the memory of Dea'n Thomas Lyman, who died Aug. 13, 1783, in the 80th year of his age. He was a man of great experience in ye Christian Religion. Few in our world have enjoyed a more constant communion with Heaven, or at intervals had greater discoveries of Divine things. His life was zealous and exemplary, his death was peaceful and triumphant. He did great honor to religion while he lived, but greater when he died. In his last moments were seen ye power of ye divine life and ye most convincing proofs to ye truth of ye Christian Religion. Behold my friends, what grace can do for men When by it, they like babes are born again. * Memoirs of Wheelock, by Drs. M'Clure and Parish."], [569, "COVENTRY. 545 COVENTRY. Coventry was first settled about the year 1700, by Nathaniel Rust and some others. The settlement of the town has, however, been dated from 1709. In the spring of this year, a number of respectable persons from Northampton and other places moved into the town, and the inhabitants were so increased in about two years, that they were incorporated with the privileges of other towns. The planters were from a great variety of places, but principally from Northampton and Hartford. The township was originally given by Joshua, sachem of the Mohegans to a number of legatees in Hartford, who conveyed their right to Wdham Pitkin, Joseph Talcott, William Whiting, and Richard Lord, to be a committee to lay out said township, and make settlements on the lands.

The Doctor then requested his brother clergyman to assist him in the duties ol his func tion ; but he objected, and said that his clolhes were not sufficiently decent to appear in the pulpit. In order to obviate this difficulty, the Doctor offered him a suit of clothes which he had not long since received from the tailor, and desired him to try them on, which he did, and found they suited very well. The objection being removed, ihe clergyman accordingly agreed to assist the Doctor the succeeding day, and desired to be by himself that evening to study his discourse. A fire was ihen made in his bed chamber, where he repaired with his new garb, at the same time acquainting the Doc tor that he must study until late at night, and hoped no noise which he might make would disturb the repose osthe family. Sunday morning came, the adroit clergyman was sent for to breakfast, but to the great surprise of the family, he was not to be found; for during the night he had taken his exit, not forgetting the garment so well suited to his clerical dignity, and leaving behind him the following select and well adapted text, prefixed at the top of the paper intended for his sermon : \" Ye shall seek me and shall not find me ; and where I am, thither ye cannot come.\" \u2014 John 7, 34.

Ellington was originally a part of the township of East Windsor, called the Great Marsh. It was incorporated as a town in 1786. It is bounded s. by Somers and Stafford, w. by East Windsor, e. by Tolland and Stafford, and s. by Vernon and Tolland. It is irregular in its form, its greatest length being nine miles, and its greatest breadth about six, comprising upwards of 21,760 acres. The township in the western part is generally level, a considerable portion of it being a plain, the soil of which is light and dry, but considerably fertile. The eastern part is broken, hilly and mountainous. It was not until about seventy five years after the settlement began on the east side of Connecticut river, that any inhabitants located themselves in the part now called Ellington. Why this tract of land was thus neglected, cannot now be easily told. It might have been the opinion which early prevailed that the mountain land was better, the limber and water better, which influenced settlers to pass from Windsor to Tol land, Willington, and olher mountainous tracts, rather than occupy these plains. The opinion was long prevalent, that the soil on the plain, near the present center of the town, and all the western section of it, was far inferior to the elevated tracts in the adjoining towns east. And even the fathers of some who are now living in the towns east, might have purchased more than double the number of acres on the plain near the center of the lown, with the same amount of capital that they invested in their farms on the mountains. Roger Wolcott interested himself in the settling of Willing- Ion some years before there was any survey of this region. Tolland had a minister settled while this town was an unbroken wilderness. Bolton and Stafford were earlier surveyed than any part of this town. Coventry had a minister fifteen or twenty years before any one was located here. The land formerly occupied by the Ellsworths in this town', where Capt. Samuel Chapman now resides, was surveyed in the year 1720, as this was the earliest date in which any person made a beginning in this place. The following is from the original record. \" Land surveyed to Daniel and John Ellsworth, sons of Lieutenant John Ellsworth, of Windsor, by Thomas Kimberly, surveyor of land in the county of Hartford, 16th of March 1720, five hundred and forty acres of land between the mountains east of Windsor and Connecticut river, at a place called by the English ' The Great Marsh,' and by the Indians ' Weaxkashuck' \u2014 340 acres bought of Capt. Joseph Wadsworth, and 200 acres bought of the Bissells, by said Lieut. John Ellsworth, began at a pine tree marked and having two mere-stones by it, standing on the plain near the north west corner of the said marsh\u2014 (then all the bounds are described.) Samuel Pinney and Daniel Grant, being under oath, assisted in carrying the chain.\""], [572, "548 ELLINGTON. This was in March, 1720. On a stone a little distance northwest from said Sam uel Chapman's is Ihe following inscription. \"Lieut. John Ellsworth was killed here by the fall of a tree, Oct. 26lh, 1720, aged 49 years and 15 days.\" So far as can be learned from the records, it does not apppear that there was any family within the lim its of Ellington, previous to the aforesaid date. It is supposed lhat the Capt. Wads worth of whom the Ellsworths purchased had a grant of land for services in the Pe quot war. Whether the Bissels, of whom the 200 acres were bought, claimed under the Indian title, or in some other way, is not known. The Rev. John McKinstry was the first minister who was settled in Ellington. He purchased a small place of An drew McKee, a little east of the place where Judge Hall's high school-house is now located, by deed dated April 27th, 1730. Three years afterwards he bought about thirty acres ofland adjoining his first purchase, ot'Simon Parsons; his deed, witness ed by Daniel Ellsworth, John Fairfield and Samuel Thompson, as appears from Windsor records. The ancient town of Windsor extended east to the road as it now runs from ihe widow Moulton's, by Wyllys Russels's. South of Lucius Chapman's, it passed on the side hill east of the road as it now runs to Bolton line, now Vernon. The land east of this, within the limits of Ellington, and called the Equivalent, was granted to the town of Windsor, and the grant making the conveyance is on the re cords in the following words: \" A patent of the Equivalent lands on the east side of Windsor. Whereas ihe Gov ernor and Company of the English colony of Connecticut, in General Court assembled at Hartford, May the 10th, 1716, did give and grant unlo the inhabitants of Windsor, in the County of Hartford, an Equivalent in the Colony lands, in consideration of 7,250 acres of land on the north side of the said town, which by the lasl settlement of the line of said Colony with the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England, was taken off from said township. G. Saltonstall, Gov. \" Hez. Wyllys, Secretary.\" These lands were surveyed, and their limits ascertained, on the 16th, 17th and 18th days of April, 1723, by James Wadsworth and John Hall. Twenty years passed away before a division of the tract was made amoug the proprietors. Proprietorship had become an exceedingly complex concern, and for almost twenty years there were yearly meetings held in which the division of these and other common lands was one osthe objects before the meeting, while the difference of opinion among the proprie tors was such, that all Iheir doings were embarrassed to a degree that prevented ihem from proceeding. In 1743, the report of a committee appointed many years before was accepted, and according to their survey and division allotments were made. They began east where Selden McKinney resides, at the north line of Bolton, now Vernon, and laid out lots in half mile ranges to Somers, and then back again. Be yond the second tier, the lots were laid north and south in two tiers, all the south range bounded south by Tolland, and all the north on the north by Stafford. Beyond this a number of lots were laid out the whole breadth from Tolland to Stafford, and thus till the last lot was bounded by the Willimantic. In all these surveys and allotments, the pond between Ellington and Tolland was uniformly written Messhanips \u2014 for the north pond bordering upon Stafford no other name is known than Square Pond. The Rev. John McKinstry was in middle life when he was settled here. He was educated in Scotland, but married his wife in Wenham, beyond Boston. She was the daughter of Deacon Fairfield, of that place. When he came to this place, he had five children, and two afterwards. Their names were John, Alexander, William, Paul, Mary, Betsey and Abigail. One of his sons was a physician, and lived al Taunton or lhat vicinity. Mary married Esq. Ellsworth, the son of Capt. Daniel Ellsworth. Betsey, while on a visit lo her brothers at the East, was murdered by a slave who lived in the family. She was making preparation lo attend an ordination in a neighboring town, arose early, and having occasion to use a flat iron, was heating it by the fire : as she was leaning over the table, the slave took the flat iron, and by a blow upon her head deprived her of life: he concealed her body under the stairs and fled: he was how ever arrested and executed, and his confession of the deed published with the sermon preached at his execution: he had been told that if he should kill some one and run away he should be free. Mr. McKinstry continued his connection wilh the people in this place but 16 years. He was succeeded in the ministry by the Rev. Nathaniel Huntington : he continued here but six years and six months, and died of a consump tion His successor was the Rev. Seth Norton: his ministry was of short continuance he died in 1762 aged 31 years. His successor was the Rev. John Bliss: he died Feb ruary 13th, 1790, aged 54. His successor was Mr. Leonard, who continued in the re lation of a minister but a few years, and was succeeded by the Rev. Diodalc Brockway. \" Ellington is situated partly on the plain and partly on the hills. A few years since no township in the county of Hartford, in which it was"], [573, "HEBRON. 549 then included, was in lower estimation ; its soil was considered lean\u2014 its agriculture was wretched, and the circumstances of its inhabitants were generally very humble. The circumstances of the community have changed, the agriculture and the buildings have improved, and the in habitants have risen not a little in their general character.\" Few tracts of country possess advantages for further improvement equal to this, to render it a delightful garden, a most beautiful heritage, and a place of moral and intellectual worth. The scenery in this town embraces con siderable variety and is uncommonly interesting and beautiful. Western view of the central part of Ellington. The above is a west view of the Congregational church, and some other buildings in the central part of Ellington. In the village, or near the center of the town, are about 40 dwelling houses, most of which are finished in a neat, plain and handsome style. There is a high school, lyceum and conference house, school for young misses, district school, and two hotels, all of which are finished in a handsome style. The \" Ellington School,\" designed principally for boys from the age of eight years to sixteen inclusive, is a respectable institution, and has acquired a deserved celebrity. The house of Judge Hall, the principal, and the hifl) school, a spacious edifice, are elegant buildings, situated a little west of the Congregational church, on a gentle but beautiful eminence. HEBRON. The first settlement of this town was commenced in 1704. The first people who made settlements in the town were William Shipman, Timothy Phelps, Samuel Filer, Caleb Jones, Stephen Post, Jacob Root Samuel Curtiss, Edward Sawyer, Joseph Youngs, and Benoni Trumbull. They were from Windsor, Saybrook, Long Island and Northampton. Hebron was incorporated as a town in 1707. It is"], [574, "550 HEBRON. bounded n. by Bolton and Coventry, w. by Glastenbury and Marlbo rough, e. by Columbia and Lebanon, and s. by Colchester. Its ave rage length from north to south is 9\u00a3 miles, and its average breadth more than four miles. The surface of the town is uneven, being some what hilly and diversified, and the soil is considerably fertile. There are in the town two located Congregational societies and churches, 1 Episcopal church and 1 Methodist. The principal village in the town is 20 miles from Hartford. Hop river, a branch of the Willimantic, forms the northeastern boundary of the town. North pond, in the south part of this town, is a considerable body of water; it is situated partly in this town and partly in Colchester. A large iron furnace for cast- ings and pig iron is now erecting near the outlet of this pond, about three miles from Hebron village. The best bed for obtaining the ore is said to be about one mile northwest of the Congregational church in Colchester. There are also in the first society, 1 woolen and 2 cotton factories, and 1 paper mill. South view of Hebron, (central part.) The above is a representation of some osthe most important buildings in the principal village in Hebron, 20 miles s. e. from Hartford. The Gothic building on the left is the Episcopal church, which is built of brick. The first dwelling house north, with four chimnies, is the resi dence of John S. Peters, Esq. formerly governor of the state. Gov. Peters was bred a physician, and is one osthe largest landed proprie tors in the town. On the right is seen in the distance the spire of the Congregational church, fronting the south, before which is a small open green. The first society contains about half the inhabitants of the town. The whole of the parish of Gilead, and about half of Ando ver, are within its limits, both of which have an excellent soil, cultiva ted by farmers. Hebron has furnished quite a number of distinguished men. Dr. Trumbull, the venerable historian of Connecticut, Gov. Peters, Gov. Palmer of Vermont, Gov. Root of New York, and three members of Congress, Sylvester Gilbert, Daniel Burrows, and the late Daniel Buck of Vermont, were all natives of this town."], [575, "551 MANSFIELD. The first minister ordained in this town was Rev. John Eliss; this was in October, 1717. He declared for Episcopacy in 1734, and having laid the foundation of a soci ety, a house of worship was erected ihe next year for lhal denomination, and Mr. Bliss preached and read service for them a number of years afterwards. The Rev. Benja min Pomeroy, D. D. in 1735, was ordained as pastor of the church and congregation from which Mr. Bliss was dismissed. He was an ardenl and zealous preacher osthe gospel, osthe New Light order, and a warm admirer of Mr. Whitefield, who at that time experienced much opposition in many places. Mr. Pomeroy's zeal in endeav oring to arouse his slumbering brethren, and their stupid congregations, in his vicin ity, was deemed irregular, and (says Dr. Trumbull,) \" a certificate was lodged against him, and, for seven years, he was deprived of his stated salary.\" The following, furnished by a correspondent, describes a scene of 'other years:' in point of fact it is believed to be substantially correct. \"The inhabitants of this town have been remarkable for their attachment to the different dynasties that have governed this country. In 1758, during the war between Greal Britain and France, ihe then North American colonies made a noble effort, aided by an army of regulars, to close a war, (waged with savage ferocity, by the combined forces of French and Indians,) by taking Louisburg, a strong fortress, and key to the Gulf and River St. Lawrence, which was gloriously accomplished by the troops under the command of General Amherst. The glad tidings were wafted on eagles' widgs to every hamlet in the suffering country, gratitude warmed every heart, and joy lighted up every countenance; cordial greetings cheered every bosom, and enormous pumpkin pies smoked on every board. It was deemed necessary that some further demonstrations should be made, to show clearly the love, of king and country that entwined around every ligament of their hearts; caps were thrown high, and a full chorus from stentorian lungs grandly echoed from the surrounding hills. A de cree went forth, that a cannon should be fired; no life-destroying instrument of that description had ever broken the silence of this part of the New World ; Yankee inge nuity was placed on the rack; an entire new article was invented, aud would have been patented forthwith, had fashion then led the way. A tremendous oaken log was brought from the forest, and without delay transformed into a cannon of the caliber of 120 pounds; to make all sure and establish the character of this new species of artillery, a son of Vulcan placed thereon massive hoops of iron ; \u2014 \"a threefold cord is not easily broken,\" \u2014 and in accordance with this truth, a cordon of wood hoops were driven close over all, so that the infernal machine had the appearance of a mummy dressed for the tomb. The work was accomplished ; the powder horns were brought together and emptied of their contents; the gun was literally crammed, and removed to the summit of a hill, that the thunder thereof might be heard to the ends of the earth; a train was set and the match lighted; the assembled multitude stood afar off in breathless anxiety ; Ihe awful moment was approaching; the torch was applied to the train ; the minion of mischief crept slowly towards the chamber of sleeping dust, like the serpent to the ear of our mother Eve, \u2014 \" Lil by the brilliant spark, from grain to grain Runs the quick fire, along the kindling train ; On the pain'd ear-drum bursts the sudden crash, Starts the red flame, and death pursues the flash.\" In an instant, hope and fear, together with the object of- adoration, were wasted to terr\u00e6 incognit\u00e6 in a fiery chariot. The same of the exploit spread over the whole world, and was written m the Chroni cles osthe kings of England; George the third, in the plenitude of his goodness, pro vided a substitute made of pure brass, that his faithful subjects might ever after sing peans to his victorious army. This mark of his majesty's favor, however, was lost in passing the Atlantic Ocean. MANSFIELD. Mansfield* was formerly comprised in the original limits osthe town of Windham, of which it was the northern section. It was made a dis- * This town was named, it is said, from Major Moses Mansfield of New Haven, who in the Indian wars, routed a party of Indians somewhere in this region.

Settlements were made here soon after they commenced at Windham. Some of the first settlers are said to have been of the names of Fenton, Royce and Hall. Patience Royce is said to have been the first white child born in the town. Settlers by the names of Storrs, Porter and Barrows, from Plymouth, were in this town at an early period. In October, 1710, the Rev. Eleazar Williams was ordained as the first minister in the town. The township is bounded north by Willington and Ashford, west by Willimantic river, dividing it from Coventry, east by Chaplin, and south by Windham. Its average length from east to west is 8 miles ; its av erage breadth nearly six. The central part is 27 miles east from Hart ford, 19 from Norwich, and 12 from Tolland. Northeast vieiv of the Presbyterian Church, Mansfield. The above is a north view of the Presbyterian church in Mansfield, and some other buildings in the vicinity, in the central part osthe town. This is believed to be the only Presbyterian church in Connecticut. The members are ruled, or governed, by 8 elders. The face of the township is uneven, being diversified with hills and valleys : the eminences in general have considerable elevation. Be sides the Willimantic, the town is watered by Nachaug river, and its tributary streams, the Mount Hope and Fenton. A larger quantity of silk is manufactured here than in any other place in the United States. This branch of industry was introduced into the countrv by Dr. Aspinwall of this place, above seventy years since, who established the raising of silk worms in in the limits of this town. The tradition is, that Major Mansfield received his name Moses, from the following circumstance; his parents, who resided either in North or East Haven, in crossing the East river in a canoe, were upset, and their infant whom they were taking across the river in order for baptism, floated away from them Be ing well wrapped up in blankets, the infant floated down the stream and lodged amon\u00b0 the rushes, where he was taken up, having received no injury. His parents intended to have named him Richard, but from the circumstance of his bein^ taken from the water and from the rushes, he was called Moses.

SOMERS. Somers is bounded n. by the Massachusetts line, w. by Enfield, e. by Stafford, and s. by Ellington. It is about six miles in length from north to south, with a mean breadth of about five miles. The central part of the town is 22 miles n. e. from Hartford, and 12 s. e. from Springfield, in Massachusetts. There is 1 Congregational and 1 Methodist church in the town ; there is also a considerable number of Baptists, who are associated with the Baptist churches in the neighboring towns. The western section osthe town is generally smooth and level, and free from stone. The eastern section is hilly and mountainous, with some heights of considerable elevation, affording an extensive and interesting prospect of Hartford, and the beautiful valley of the Connecticut. Somers was formerly the southeast part of the ancient town of Springfield, granted by the General Court of Massachusetts to Mr. Pyncheon and his company. It was afterwards incorporated with the town of Enfield, and was part osthe same ecclesias tical society, and so continued to be until about the year 1726, when it was made a dis tinct ecclesiastical society, by the General Court of Massachusetts, by the name of East Enfield. The town of Enfield, when incorporated, extended from Connecticut river to Stafford, ten miles. The first person who moved on to Somers was Benjamin Jones, of Welch extraction. He was from Enfield; and in 170G moved on to this tract where he resided in the summer,* but moved back in the winter, and at other * This was near the foot osthe mountain, on ihe principal road which passes through the lown from Enfield to Stafford. 70"], [578, "554 SOMERS times when danger was apprehended. But no permanent settlement was made tints! 1713, when Edward Kibbe, James Pease, Timothy Root, and John M'Gregory, wilh their families, joined with Jones, and made a durable settlement. Soon after, several other families became residents in the town, by the names of Horton, Killam, Wood, Collins, Cittron, Davis, Sexton, Parsons, Blood, Purchase, Rockwood, Felt and Fisk. Their first pastor was the Rev. Samuel Allis, who was ordained in March, 1727. In 1734, the General Court of Massachusetts incorporated the society as a town by the name of Somers. It is said to have been thus named at the request of Gov. Belcher, in honor of Lord Somers, for whom he had a peculiar respect and veneration.* Tbe town first transacted its business under the government of Connecticut, in 1749. West view of Somers; (central part.) The above is a view of the central part of the town, where the two principal roads intersect each other at right angles. The principal vil lage is situated on a street running east and west, and extending about a mile. The building on the extreme right is. the Methodist church, recently erected : there are perhaps 30 or 40 dwelling houses within half a mile of this building : the Congregational church is about half a mile to the north. There are in tbe village 4 or 5 mercantile stores, and one establishment, owned by Ebenezer Clark, Esq. for the manu facture of ladies' straw bonnets, being, it is believed, the only one of the kind in the state. At present about 30 hands are employed, and about 100 hats manufactured daily. Part of the material, or straw, of which they are formed, is imported from abroad. Mr. Clark commen ced the manufacture of these hats or bonnets about six years since. \" In the year 1775, a malignant fever prevailed in this town. It began about the first of August, and raged three months. This sickness had been immediately preceded by the scarlet fever and dysentery, which carried off a number. Thirty six persons died that year, most of whom died of the fever, about one in twenty nine of the whole number of inhabitants in the town. It seized its patients with great violence, and fre quently brought life to a close by the eighth day, and sometimes as early as the sixth. It rarely failed of attacking every person in the house where it entered, in its early stages. The people in general were silled with great consternation. Nurses were procured with great difficulty, and, in some instances, the sick must have suffered, if recourse had not been had to legal coercion.\" \" The scenes of distress which opened among the sick and dying, can be remembered by us who were eye witnesses, but can not be described.\" * Dr. Trumbnll."], [579, "555 STAFFORD.

He expired, lepeating the angelic song, Luke 2d, 14th, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men. STAFFORD. Stafford is divided into two societies, or parishes, Stafford and West Stafford. It is bounded n. by the Massachusetts line, w. by Somers, s. by Ellington and Willington, and e. by Union. It is about 8J miles in length from east to west, and upwards of six in breadth. The face of the country in Stafford is hilly, and in West Stafford mountainous, abounding with primitive rocks. The prevailing soil is a gravelly loam, hard and dry, generally favorable for grass. Northwest view of St a fjord Mineral Springs Hotel. This town was surveyed in 1718, and its settlement was commenced in the spring of tt,P followine vear The principal settlers were twelve in number.

There are several minerals in the town, of which iron ore is the most important. Several mines of it have been opened. The ore which is principally used is the bog ore, and is of an excellent quality. In 1779, Mr lohn Phelps and others built a blast furnace on a large scale. Hol low ware, cannon, cannon shot, and a great variety of patterns for man ufacturers and other descriptions of machinery, were cast. In 1796,"], [580, "556 UNION another furnace was erected by Mr. Nathaniel Hyde and company. This, also, is upon an extensive scale. The mineral springs in Stafford have justly acquired considerable celebrity. They are situated upon a stage road, between Hartford and Boston, six miles from Tolland court house, and 24 miles from Hartford. The view shows the appearance of the hotel, and most of the other buildings connected with the establishment, as viewed from the stage road which passes by, a few rods to the north. The principal spring rises behind the building nearest the hotel, on the banks of a stream, one of the branches of the Willimantic river. There is another spring a few rods westward. The Indians first made the settlers acquainted with the virtues of these springs, when, in ihe year 1719, this part of the country began to be settled. \" It has been their practice, time immemorial, to resort to them in the warm season, and plant their wig wams round them. They recommended the water as an eye water ; but gave, as their own particular reason for drinking it, that it enlivened their spirits.\" It is said, that in 1766, these springs were carefully examined by Dr. Warren, who then had thoughts of purchasing thejand on which they rise, with a view of establishing himself upon it. Subsequent events transformed the physician into a soldier, and Dr. Warren fell in the first great struggle of the Revolution, with the rank of a major general, at the battle of Bunker's hill. Dr. Willard afterwards put Dr. Warren's plan into operation, by building a large hotel for the reception of patients and others. The establishment is at present owned by Mr. Jasper Hyde, and its former reputation is fully sustained, and it is a place of much resort for the purposes of health or pleasure during the sum mer season. \u2014 \" There ate two distinct springs, the medical qualities of which are con sidered as essentially different. One of them contains a solution of iron, sustained by carbonic acid gas, a portion of marine salt, some earthly substances, and what has been called natron, or a native alkili. This spring has been known and used fora length of time, and has been pronounced by chemists to be one of the most efficacious chalybeate springs in the United States. The other spring, the medicinal virtues of which were not known till about the year 1810, contains, according to the opinion of Professor Silliman, (who examined it in that year,) a large portion of hydrogen gas, of sulphur, and a small proponion of iron.\" \u2014 \" These springs did not acquire much celebrity until about the year 1765, when a case occured calculated to establish and extend their reputation. It was an effectual cure of a most obstinate cutaneous com plaint which had completely baffled all medicinal skill, and resisted all other applica tions. The publicity which was given to this case soon raised the reputation of ihese springs ; and a consequence of which they immediately became a place of resort of persons afflicted with various diseases.\" UNION. \"The settlement of this town begun in 1727. The first and princi pal settlers were William McNall, John Lawson, and James Sherrer, from Ireland. The progress of the settlement appears to have been slow, and the town was not incorporated till 1734. It is bounded n. by the Massachusetts line, w. by Stafford, e. by Woodstock, and s. by Ashsord. Its length is between five and six miles from north to south, and its breadth averages about the same distance. The central part of the town is about 33 miles northeasterly from Hartford. \"The surface of this town is broken, being hilly and rocky, and the soil generally unproductive. Mashapaug pond in this town is a beau tiful expanse of water, and covers an area of about 800 acres. The population of Union in 1830 was seven hundred and eleven. \"This town,\" says Pease and Niles's Gazetteer, \" furnishes a striking example"], [581, "557 VERNON. of the inequality and injustice of the principle of representation in this state, and of the prevalence of the ' borough system' of England. Union, with a population of 752, and with a list of 17,000 dollars, has an equal representation with New Haven, which has a population of more than 7,000, and a list of 133,000 dollars; having more than nine times the inhabitants of Union, and paying nearly eight times the amount of taxes; and upon a more just principle of taxation, the dif ference in this respect would be more conspicuous.\" VERNON. Southwestern view of Vernon, (central part.) This town was first settled by persons from East Windsor, in 1716. It was originally a parish formed from East Windsor and Bolton, called North Bolton. It was incorporated a town in 1808. It is bounded n. by Ellington, w. by East Windsor and Manchester, e. by Tolland and! Coventry, and s. by Bolton. The town is about 5 miles in length and upwards of 3 J in breadth. The greater part of the town is uneven, being agreeably diversified by hill and dale. The soil is generally a gravelly\u00b0loam, somewhat stony, yet considerably fertile. The eastern part of the township is crossed by a range of mountains, which is the eastern boundary of the great valley of the Connecticut. The most considerable streams are the Hockanum and Tankerooson, which sup ply water to several mills and factories. A cotton manufactory, for a lon^ time the only successful one established in Connecticut, was erect ed in the western part of this town by Mr. Warburton, an Englishman. The manufacturing business is carried on in this town to a considerable extent. There are 4 cotton mills or factories, and 6 or 8 satinet fac tories now in operation, and 1 paper mill. Rock village is about 1 mile below Snipsic pond and 14 from Hartford; it contains 6 satinet factories and 1 paper mill. Tankerooson, the cotton manufacturing vil lage, is about 10 miles east from Hartford."], [582, "558 WILLINGTON. The cut on the preceding page is a western view of the Congrega tional church in Vernon, and other buildings in the vicinity, 12 miles from Hartford. The first meeting house in tbe town was upwards of half a mile east, on the summit of a hill. The Rev. Ebenezer Kellog was the first minister in the place. The following is the inscription on his monument in the ancient burying ground. Rev. Ebenezer Kellog, died Sept. 3d, 1817, in the 81st year of his age and 55lh year of his ministry in this place. In yonder sacred house he spent his breath, Now silent, senseless, here he sleeps in death, These lips again shall wake, and Ihen declare A loud Amen, to truths they published there. WILLINGTON. The township of Willington was sold and granted by the Governor and company for five hundred and ten pounds, to the following gentle men: Roger Wolcott, Esq. of Windsor, John Burr of Fairfield, John Riggs of Derby, Samuel Gunn and George Clark of Milford, John Stone and Peter Pratt of Hartford, and Ebenezer Fitch. This sale took place in 1720. A few families had settled on the lands in this town previous to this time. \" The settlers were from various parts of New England, and they moved on to the land one after another in a very scattering manner. The first minister settled in the town was the Rev. Daniel Fuller, who was ordained in 1728. Willington is bounded n. by Stafford, w. by the Willimantic river, which divides it from Tolland, e. by Ashsord, and s. by Mansfield. It is upwards of seven miles in length from north to south, and four and a half miles in breadth. The surface of this town is hilly and broken, abounding with stone. The summits of the mountains and hills are generally covered with granite and other rocks. Iron ore to some ex tent has been found in this town. The central part of the town is about 24 miles easterly from Hartford. Willington, June, 1784. Whereas of late years, there has been advanced for a certainty, by a quack Doctor, a foreigner, that a certain cure may be had for consumption, where any of the same family had before time died with the same disease ; directing to have the bodies of such as had died to be dug up, and further said that out of the breast or vitals might be found a sprout or vine fresh and growing, which together with the remains of ihe vitals, being consumed in sire, would be an effectual cure to the same family: \u2014 and such directions so far gained credit, that in one instance the experiment was thor oughly made in Willington. On ihe first day of June instant, two bodies were dug up which belonged to the family of Mr. Isaac Johnson of that place; they both died with the consumption. One had been buried one year and eleven months, the other one year, a third of the family then sick. On full examination of the then small re mains by two doctors then present, viz. Doctors Grant and West, not the least discov ery could be made ; and to prevent misrepresentations of the facts, I being an eye wit ness, confess that under ihe coffin were sundry small sprouts, about an inch in length, then fresh, but most likely they were the produce of sorrel seeds which fell under the coffin when put in the earth ; and that the bodies of the dead may rest quiet in their graves without interruption, I think the public ought to beware of being led away by such an impostor. Moses Holmes."], [583, "559 APPENDIX. [The following account, respecting a tribe of Indians who formerly resided in Glastenbury, was fur nished by Gideon Welles, Esq. to whose politeness the author is also indebted for other facts relating to the history of his native town.] Tradition tells of a brave tribe of aborigines which occupied a position a little south of the center of the town, known by the name of the Red Hill Indians. They were a branch osthe Pequots, and between them and the Mohawks there were unsparing and relentless hostilities. The Red Hills had a fort on a very precipitous hill, which was strongly sonified on the east, bul towards the river, on the west, the besieged relied principally on large logs and stones, which they rolled down upon iheir enemies, if they attempted to ascend the eminence. Spies and friendly Indians informed the Red Hills osthe advance of their enemies, who immediately gathered their women and children within the fort; and, on several occasions made a gallant defense, \u2014 repelling the Mohawks with great loss. At length the Mohawks, whose numbers far exceeded those of the Red Hills, and who had usu ally made their most desperate effort by trying to ascend the hill, resorted to stratagem. Word came to the Red Hills that the \" Mohawks were coming,\" and they hastily gathered their little tribe within the fort. But the Mohawks did not make their ap pearance, and after waiting for some time in vain, the Red Hills despatched a small number up the river, for the purpose of reconnoitering. Near the upper part of East Windsor or Enfield, the party struck upon a trail, which they followed in a southeast erly direction until they came to the head waters of Roaring Brook, near Minachaug mountain. Here all traces ceased, \u2014 no trail, nor track, nor scent, could be ibund. Subsequent events showed that the Mohawks had at this place entered the stream, and, that they might not be traced, had waded down the entire distance to near the mouth, where were the fort and village of the Red Hills. The scheme was success ful. The hapless Red Hills were surprised, and experienced more than savage ven geance. The Mohawks spared not one of the race. This horrid butchery is said to have taken place about the period when the first settlers emigrated to Connecticul. Although the whites had no part in this tragedy, the bloody legend was remembered and told, and the froward child was often subdued by the terrific exclamation, \"the Mohawks are coming.\" [For the following account of Chaplin the author is indebted to Walter Goodcll, Esq. of Chaplin : it was not received in time to have it inserted in its regular place.] CHAPLIN. Chaplin, a small township in the westerly part of Windham County, was formed from the towns of Mansfield, Hampton, and a small section osthe town of Windham. It is bounded n. by Ashsord, e. by Hampton, s. by Windham, and w. by Mansfield. The principal part of the township, however, was included in the limits of Mansfield. It is five and a half miles in length from north to south, and averages about three and a half in width, containing about nineteen square miles. Amon\" the original settlers in the easterly section of said Mansfield, was Deacon Benjamin Chap lin who removed from that part of the town of Hampton which formerly belonged to Pomfret, and located himself near where the meeting house now stands, in the present town of Chaplin. To his en ergetic efforts in a great measure, was owing the formation of a society here, which was incorporated by the Legislature in IS09, and called Chaplin, after the name of its friend and benefactor. In 1822, this society obtained an act of incorporation, as a town, by its present name. A church was formed here May 31st, 1810, with whom the Rev. David Avery labored as an evangelist some length of time ; but it remained without any settled minister until the year 1820, when the Rev. Jared Andrus was or dained as pastor, December 27th. His ministry continued ten years, when he was dismissed in consequence of some dissatisfaction the neoDle of his charge. His successor, the Rev. Lent S. Hough, was ordained August 17th, lSi and continued as stated pastor till December 20tlr, 1830, when he was dismissed in compliance with his previous request. The ecclesiastical society here have a permanent fund, amounting to s'\" 000 secured by bond and mortgage, the interest of which is annually appropriated \" toward the ?ui>nort of tlif gospel ministry.\" Among the principal donors of this fund, was Deacon Benjamin Chaplin who contributed the sum of 300/. and by other individual subscriptions itwaB increased to the sum be/ore mentioned. In works of benevolence and charity, Deacon Chaplin was ever found among Ihe foremost of his day. He was an economist of the \" old school,\" and the strict attention with"], [584, "560 APPENDIX. which he managed his farm and all his domestic concerns, enabled him to accumulate wealth rapidly, and to add yearly to his possessions, until he became the owner at one time of 3,000 acres of laud, in cluding a very considerable part of the town which now bears his name. There was likewise another large territory, mostly wood land, lying chiefly within the limits of this town, and which formerly belonged to the \" Welles family,1' at present in the care of the Hon. John Welles, of Boston, Mass. Within a few years past, however, this land has nearly all been taken up, and is now under good cultivation. The town of Chaplin is intersected by ihe Natchaug river, a never sailing stream of water, which passes through it diagonally from the northeast to the southwest. On this stream are many valuable mill seats and eligible sites for factories or water works of any description. The surface of the town is generally uneven, with a soil consid erably strong and fertile, particularly in the valley of the Natchaug, where may be found as good land as in any part of the state. The principal village is located near the center of the town, on the west side and within a short distance of the river, upon a small elevation of land, and consists of about 30 dwelling houses, a Congregational meeting house, school house, post office, 3 mercantile stores, 1 jeweller's shop, 1 tav ern, 1 hat factory, and a number of shoemaker's shops, all situated on one street, of more than a mile in extent. The distance from Brooklyn, the county seat, is 11 miles, from Norwich 22 miles, and from Hartford 33 miles. Great attention is paid in this town, as well as in the adjoining town of Mansfield, to the culture of silk. About 1,200 lbs. of the raw material are annually produced here, which would bring, when wrought into sewings, $9,500. The labor of rearing ihe worms, reeling and spinning the silk, and preparing it for market, is wholly performed by females, who make it quite a lucrative business. About 40 hands are also employed in the manufacture of calfskin boots and brogans, who turn out work annually to the amount of \u00a730,000. There are likewise in this town 2 grist mills, 5 saw mills, and 3 shingle mills, from which more than $12,000 worth of oak and chestnut lumber is sold yearly. A card ing machine and clothier's establishment are also doing a respectable business. Dur ing the year 1835, the Messrs. Lyons of Boston purchased a site on the Natchaug riv er, half a mile south of the village, and erected a paper mill, upon an extensive scale, with 4 run of engines, where they manufacture paper, principally for the New York market, to the amount of $65,000 annually. Owing lo the rapid descent of the water near these mills, some of the finest privileges are here to be found for manufacturing purposes of any in the state. A county road passes north and south through the town, adjacent to the river, on which a tri-weekly mail is carried, connecting with the Hart ford and Providence stages at Ashsord and Windham. In the summer season the wild scenery of nature, which meets the eye of the traveler in passing up and down on this route, winding his way along the banks of the Natchaug, is delightfully ro mantic. The present population of Chaplin is about 1,000. The following is the inscription copied from the monument in memory of Deacon Chaplin. Deacon Benjamin Chaplin, that Friend of Man, that supporter of the State, that ornament of the Church, who, having witnessed a good Confession for the doctrines of grace, for the purity and per petuity of public worship, a faithful steward of his Lord's goods, provided liberally in his last will and testament towards a permanent fund for the maintenance of the Gospel ministry, and, after he had served his own generation, by the will of God, fell on sleep, March 25th, 1795, in the 76lh year of his age. 'Tis but a moment bounds our latest breath, A span hath well describ'd the narrow space, O ! be it thine, that read'st, to think of death, Be it thy prayer to know the Savior's grace : For soon the Archangel's trump will rend the air, The dead shall hear, and hearing, all shall rise, All that have died shall in that summons share, And stand before the dread tribunal of the skies. But, oh ! how different their hopes and fears ! Description cannot paint the awful day ! For some will rise to pain of endless years, Darkness and woe, without one cheering ray. But rising saints will list their joyful eyes, Will see the earth depart, and all terrestrial good, Will then be blest, and mount above the skies, To dwell within the mansions of their God."], [585, ""], [586, ""], [587, ""], [588, ""], [589, ""], [590, "*>\""], [591, ""], [592, ""]]
