Chronicles of events and occurrences which happened to the inhabitants of those towns in New England which began to be settled during the first half century after the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers at Plymouth, have become almost universal. The reminiscences furnished by these local histories are interesting to the present generation on several accounts. They afford us the means of comparing the hardships, trials and privations en- dured by our progenitors, with the ease, comforts and abundance enjoyed by us ; a comparison, which may well reconcile us to the trifling inconveniences and molestations we too often permit to make us discontented. A kind of melancholy pleasure is afforded by contemplating the courage with which they met, the fortitude with which they sustained, and the patience with which they endured the dan- gers, difficulties and destitutions to which they were constantly exposed. They will also furnish the future historian with materials for a more general, comprehensive and philosophical narrative. Groton, it is thought, affords as many incidents worthy of record, as almost any town in New"], [16, "PREFACE. VI England settled as late as 1655. It had its full proportion of suffering with Swanzey, Brookfield, Deerfield, Hadley, Lancaster, Medfield, Sudbury, &c, in the Indian wars of 1675 and 1676, and of 1694. Its efforts and exertions also in the war of the Revolution, and the part taken by some of its inhabitants in the insurrection of 1787, deserve to be remembered ; the former for praise and imitation, the latter for caution and avoidance. In its topographical character, the fertility and productions of its soil, its eligible situation, and its literary and other advantages, it bears a favorable comparison with any other town equally remote from navigation and from the metropolis. The characters of some of its first settlers and suc ceeding inhabitants are not without interest, both for instruction and amusement. Unfortunately, however, the time for successfully collecting, digest ing, and recording the incidents of by-gone times, necessary to a complete history, has been too long deferred. Many transactions and occurrences com mitted only to frail and erring memory, are either wholly lost, or are so faded and shadowed, that their beauty and correctness cannot be depended on ; and others, though placed upon record at the time they happened, have been corrupted by \" moth and rust.\" As the habits, modes of living, opinions eccle siastical or political, individual characters, and in fine the whole history of any people, can be better learned from their own sayings, acts, and writings, than from description, the following pages are rather"], [17, "PREFACE. VII a compilation of facts and documents, copies of pub lic records, and other printed or written testimo nials, than a regular history of the towns to which they relate. One main object of the author in taking copies, in preference to reciting in his own language, is to preserve the principal matters con tained in three or four volumes of the oldest records of Groton, in the language and style of the clerks who penned them, from being entirely lost. They are already, by age and being often handled, much defaced and worn, and unless now or very soon copied, they will be illegible. The family registers of marriages, births and deaths, in the Appendices, will save much time and trouble in searching the originals, and preserve the records from total de struction for a longer time to come. The reader is apprised that the orthography of the original has been made to conform to modern usage, but the words, with all their improprieties, bad construction and false grammar, have not been altered. It is thought that exact copies, verbatim et literatim, would disgust, rather than instruct or amuse. In copies from the old records, dates are uniformly set down as they are found, except an error of the clerk has been rendered certain. Some improprieties will be found, especially in the Appendix, such as Nov. 31, Feb. 29, when not bissextile, children of the same parents born apparently within six months of each other ; but these are. few. In dates previous to 1752, there is liability to err by not noticing the difference between old and new style ; and from"], [18, "VIII PREFACE. January 1, to March 25, by a difference in com mencing the year. That the reader may guard against errors in these dates, and understand how to compute and reduce any date to our present reckoning of time, as brief an account of style, and its change from old to new, and of the difference in time of commencing the year, as the nature of the subject will permit, is here given. A tropical year is a natural division of time, being that in which the sun apparently moves from a tro pic or equinox around the heavens to the same point again. A civil year consists of a certain number of days, classed into weeks and months. If the tropi cal year consisted of an exact number of days, that is, if the sun returned to the tropic at precisely the same time in the day in which it left, the tropical and civil year might and would be forever the same, and the seasons would remain unmoved and fixed to the same months and days. But this is not the case. The civil year must of necessity consist of a certain number of days ; but the tropical year is found to consist of about 365 days, 5 hours, 48 min utes, and 50 seconds. To fix a calendar, by which the two years should coincide as nearly as possible, (exactness being impossible,) has been a desideratum with astronomers, mathematicians, and sovereigns. The numerous abortive attempts made by different nations need not be mentioned. Julius C\u00e6sar, with the aid of Sosigenes, a famous mathematician of his time, was the first to adopt a method nearly correct. Finding that the tropical year consists of about 365 days and 6 hours, he fixed the common year of his"], [19, "PREFACE. IX > calendar at 365 days ; and as the fractional part of the day, 6 hours, would in four years amount to just one day, he made every fourth year to consist of 366 days, by counting the sixth of the calends of March (Feb. 24) twice, hence called Bissextile, or vulgarly Leap-year. Had 365 days, 6 hours, been exactly the amount of the tropical year, the desideratum would have been attained, and the seasons have remained fixed to the same days. As it is, it was the best arrangement of the calendar which hitherto had been made ; no error therein was discovered for several centuries. It is still retained by the Russians. This is called the Julian, or Old Style, which commenced 46 years before the Christian era, the sun being in the vernal equinox that year on the 25th of March. The names of the months in C\u00e6sar's calendar were the same as in ours, and his year began as ours, January 1. At length it was discovered, that the assumed year of 365 days, 6 hours, exceeded the true tropical year by 11 minutes and 10 or 15 seconds, and that there by the vernal equinox was receding from the 25th of March at the rate of that time annually, amounting to about one day in 130 years. -Again ingenuity was applied to correct the calendar, and various propositions made for the purpose, which it is un necessary to state. Pope Gregory XIII., finding that the feast days of the church were being de ranged by the defect in the reckoning, undertook a reform of the Julian calendar. In the year 1583, having called to his aid the most eminent astrono mers and mathematicians of the age, and they find- b"], [20, "X PREFACE. ing that the vernal equinox, which happened on the 21st of March in the year 325, when the famous council of Nice was held, had receded to the 11th of March, he ordered ten days to be left out of the month of October in the year 1583, by counting the fifth day the fifteenth. This of course brought the equinox of the next succeeding year to the 21st of March, where it was in the year of the Nicene council, when Easter and other church festivals were arranged. To prevent the recurrence of the recession of the equinoxes in suture, Gregory or dered, that three bissextile years in every four hun dred thereafter, should be reduced to common years, viz. 1700, 1800, and 1900, in the then next four centuries, being a deduction at the rate of one day to about 130 years, the deficiency above stated. And by this arrangement, though not perfectly exact, the civil and tropical years will not vary to the amount of a day for 5,000 years to come. This is called the Gregorian, or New Style. This reformed calendar was soon after adopted by all the Catholic countries of Europe ; but the Protestants, from prejudice, or fear (as one of their clergy avowed) that \" the hand of Joab was in it,\" retained the old style. At length, however, prejudice and fear having ceased, or lost their power, the Parliament of Great Britain, in 1751, passed an act, adopting the new style, and ordering eleven days (the year 1700 having been reckoned a bissextile, and consequently making the difference one day more than at Gre gory's reform,) in the month of September, 1752,"], [21, "PREFACE. XI to be omitted, by calling the 3d day of that month the 1 4th. Hence it is evident that to any date made according to old style, between 1582 and 1700, (1600 being bissextile, according to both reckonings,) 10 days must be added to render it new style;* and since 1700, (that being a common year with Catholics, but bissextile with Protestants,) 11 days must be added. The times at which to commence the year have been numerous, and have caused more errors, than the different calendars in other respects. The equi noxes, solstices, certain festivals, and other epochs, have at different times and by different nations been the commencement of the year. Two or three of these only need to be mentioned. The Romans at one time had the year divided into ten months only, commencing with March, so that September, October, November and December had their numerical rank according to their Latin etymology. This year consisted of only 304 days, and the seasons consequently fast removed from their places. Two more months were therefore added, January at the beginning, said to be so called from two-faced Janus, one face looking back upon the old year, and the other forward to the new ; and February at the close of the year, after wards placed between January and March. The number of days in these two months, when added * The landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth wa3 on the 11th of Decem ber, 1620. Ten days only should be added to make it correspond with new style. By some inadvertence the 22d instead of the 21st has been celebrated as the anniversary of that event."], [22, "PREFACE. XII to the year of 304 days, did not make it equal to a tropical year, so that Julius C\u00e6sar, when he estab lished his calendar, was under the necessity of add inff 90 days to the end of one year, hence called the year of confusion, in order to reduce the seasons to their proper places. The year then commenced January 1. This commencement of the year was not universally adopted. In England, the year at one time commenced at Christmas, at another at the Annunciation, March 25, and finally it was fixed by law in the reign of Henry VIII., at the Annuncia tion. Historians, however, adhered to the 1st of January, and thus came the distinction of civil or legal year, and historical year. Hence also origi nated the practice of double-dating between Jan uary 1, and March 25, thus: \"Feb. 11, 1731-2,\" or \" 173J,\" the numerator of the fraction expressing the civil or legal year, and the denominator the his torical. This method, if strictly observed, would have plainly indicated the true time ; bul in many instances we find but a single date, and then we are in doubt, unless we can compare with some other date known to have been in the same year. In general it is supposed, that a single date between Jan. 1, and March 25, previous to 1752, indicates the legal year; but it is by no means certain. Another method of dating used by our Puritan ancestors occasions no little perplexity. The heath enish names given to the months, and to the days of the week, were an offence to them ; so instead of them they used the ordinals, 1st, 2d, 3d, &c, both for months and days. Thus 10 d. 6 m. 1667, de-"], [23, "PREFACE. XIII noted August 10, 1667, as they commenced the year with March 1. In this, however, it is not certain that every clerk was uniform. Some, it is thought, called January the first month, for there are instances of a double date in the year, when in the first or second month. These inconveniences and uncertainties were all remedied by the act of Parliament, by which the style was reformed. By that statute the legal was made to conform to the historical year, and to the common usage of the other nations of Europe, as well as to that of their own people, whose almanacs had long before, perhaps always, commenced the year with January 1. It is much to be regretted, that when these refor mations were made by authority, the commencement of the year had not been fixed at the vernal equinox, and a disposition made of the days of the months a little different from our present calendar ; but a change would now be attended with very serious inconvenience, and perhaps insurmountable difficulty. The compiler will not further extend these pre fatory remarks, already perhaps too prolix for pro priety, by naming all, who have aided, assisted and encouraged him in the progress of his labor.

The records of the Town show that \" meet men \" were found amongst the inhabitants in December, 1662, when Deacon James Par ker, John Lawrence, William Martin, Richard Blood and 3"], [40, "18 SURVEY OF THE TOWN. James Fiske were chosen Selectmen. The record is in the handwriting of Richard Sawtell, who was town clerk for several years. It is impossible at this time to know precisely what were the proceedings of the grantees, and what were the \" entanglements \" which so obstructed and hindered the planting of Groton ; but from the tenor of John Tinker's petition and the committee's report thereon, the plain inference is, that the Proprietors had included more lands in their lots than they were justly entitled to, or had pro ceeded unfairly and illegally in setting them out, and had not admitted others to come in upon equitable terms, by which conduct, they had forfeited their rights in the grant. The names of Richard Smith and others mentioned in the report do not appear in an enviable light. John Tinker alone seems to be the champion of justice and equity. There are certain hereditaments in law called heir-looms, which are said to descend with the land. If any one im agines at the present day, that he can discern the disposi tion of Richard Smith and others in any of the present proprietors of that soil, which was the cause of those hin drances and \" entanglements,\" let him be assured, that some of the present freeholders of Groton inherit the spirit of good John Tinker. It appears by the following document, that the survey of the town ordered in 1665, was not completed till the year 1668. \" Whereas the Plantation of Groton, containing by grant the proportion of eight miles square, was begun to be laid out by Ensign Noyes, and he dying before he had finished his work, it is now finished, whose limits and bounds are as followeth : \" It began on the east side of Nashua river, a little be low Nissitissit hills, at the short turning of the river, bounded by a pine tree marked with G, and so running"], [41, ""], [42, ""], [43, "19 BOUNDARY LINES. two miles in a direct line to Buck meadow, which pertains to Boston farms, and so is bounded by Boston farms, Billerica land and Edward Cowell's farm, until you come to Massapoag pond, which is full of small islands, from thence it is bounded by Chelmsford and Nashobah lines, until you come to the most southerly corner of this plan tation ; and from thence it runs west-northwest live miles and a half and sixty-four poles, which again reacheth to Nashua river ; thence the former west-northwest line is continued one mile on the west side of the river ; and then it runs one third of a point easterly of north-and by east, nine miles and one quarter ; from thence it runneth four miles due east, which closeth the work to the river again, to the first pine tree below the Nissitissit hills, where we began. It is bounded by the farms and plan tations as aforesaid, and by the wilderness elsewhere ; all which lines are run and very sufficiently bounded by marked trees and pillars of stones. The figure or manner of the lying of it is more fully demonstrated by this plot taken of the same.\" \"April, 1668, By Jonathan Danforth.\" These boundary lines and plot referred to, include the whole of what is now Groton, nearly the whole of Pep perell and Shirley, large portions of Littleton and Dun stable, and smaller portions of Harvard, Westford, and Nashua, N. H. If the aforementioned committee of the General Court included in their estimation of the capacity of the place for subsistence by husbandry those parts only, which had been planted by the Indians, and needed but little culture to render them productive, and the meadows, which then spontaneously produced fodder for cattle, their judgment may not have been very erroneous ; but if they included the whole of the territory as surveyed, and made their es timation of its prospective capability of productiveness,"], [44, "20 INDIAN TITLE. their foresight cannot be very highly appreciated. In the latter case their estimation was one family to each square mile, or six hundred and forty acres. There are now probably ten times the number of families estimated by the committee living upon the above described and bounded territory and subsisting principally by hus bandry. Should our wisest and most intelligent men at this time undertake to predict what would be the pro ductiveness, inhabitancy, or any other condition of Groton two centuries hence, they might judge as errone ously as did Thomas Danforth, Edward Johnson, and Ephraim Child, nearly two centuries ago. After the distressing war, waged by the Indians under King Philip in the years 1675 and 1676 against the Eng lish settlements in New England, had been closed, the proprietors of Groton seem to have thought, that their title to the plantation from Kings James and Charles of Eng land, through the Council of Plymouth and the General Court of Massachusetts, was not complete ; and they there upon undertook to strengthen it by grant from the abo rigines. This would give them a title by ancient pos sesssion, their former titles being by right of discovery. The following copies will show the proceedings of the inhabitants in this matter.

After the acceptance of the report of the Committee appointed and sent by the General Court to investigate the affairs of Groton in the year 1661, the settlement appears to have proceeded prosperously. Town records are in existence dated June 23, 1662. This is probably the first record ever made of any proceedings of the town. Votes passed at this date, and Dec. 24th of the same year, in relation to building a meeting-house, and a house for the minister. Selectmen and other town officers were chosen and other town business was transacted. What the number of inhabitants was at this time, is not known, but by their being able to settle a minister and build a meeting-house, it may be inferred, that the number was considerable.1 The first settlers of Groton, or proprietors of the land, were tenants in common of the whole township, though not in equal shares or proportions. They ex- 1 As evidence that there were a considerable number of inhabitants, take the following records. \"A country rate for the year 1665, the total sum being \u00a311 5s 6d.\" \" A county rate for the same year, the total sum being \u00a31 15s 3d, both which rates, committed into the hands of John Page to gather, by order of the Selectmen.\" 4"], [50, "26 original proprietors. pressed their several proportions by a certain number of \"acre rights.\" One owned a \"sixty acre right,\" another a \" twenty acre right,\" another a \" five acre right,\" &c. The whole township being equal to eight miles square, or 40,960 acres, and the whole number of \" acre rights,\" only 755, a proprietor who owned a sixty acre right, would have been entitled upon partition, to about 3,242 acres, and one who possessed a one acre right only, to above 54 acres. In making the first division of lands, however, the proprietors were restricted to a small number of acres, as has been heretofore stated. In the year 1713, the General Court passed \" An Act directing how meetings of proprietors of lands lying in common may be called.\" No distinction was made until after the passing of this statute between the inhabitants and the proprietors of Groton. Their transactions and records were all considered as those of the town, and kept in one book. In 1717 the proprietors called a meeting according to the provision of the statute, and from that time separate records were kept. At their first meeting, held March 4th, 1716-17, they chose a committee to find from the town book the names of all the original and ancient proprietors, and their pro portional rights ; and also the names and rights of all others, who claimed by descent, purchase, grants by the proprietors, &c. This committee reported the names and rights of the original proprietors, as follows : Capt James Parker, 50 acre right. Wm. Longley, Sen., 30 acre right.

This list contains about sixty names, and their number of acre rights is four hundred and forty-five and a half. To this list the pro prietors, by vote, added about twenty-five more, who produced satisfactory titles to two hundred and thirty-six acre rights. These claimants, for the most part, are said to have derived their titles by descent from their fathers, named in the first list, or by purchase of them. Jonas Prescott, however, is stated to have had a thirty acre right by a grant from the town. The committee reported at the same time, that in voting, the proprietors should vote according to the num ber of acre rights they possessed, one vote to every acre right. Among the earliest votes of the town are the follow ing. \" At a general town meeting, December 24, 1662, it is agreed, that Richard Sawtell, being chosen to be the Town Clerk, shall have sixpence for recording and giving"], [52, "28 INSTRUCTIONS TO SELECTMEN. a transcript for every twenty acres of land to the several proprietors. \" It is agreed, that all the lands that are, or shall here after be, granted, shall be recorded with these expressions following, viz. To such a one, or such a one, ten or twenty acres, so and so bounded, be it esteemed more or less.\" Records of lands had been accordingly made in the town book, which contained the proceedings of the town, laying out of highways, rates and orders of the Selectmen, &c. This practice being inconvenient, the town, at a general meeting, held 12th day of 10th month, 1682, chose a committee of five men, to give instructions to the Se lectmen. Their instructions are on record. The 7th instruction is this. \" The Selectmen are to take special care, that there be a town book, and a sufficient man chosen to record our lands as may stand according to law.\" In compliance with this instruction, John Morse, who was Town Clerk from 1669 to 1681 inclusive, copied the transcript of lands from the old book, in the winter of 16S3-4, putting each proprietor's lots orderly together, and numbering them, first the uplands, then the meadows. The number of lots to each individual set out in this first division of land was very great. James Parker, who owned a fifty acre right, had no less than fifty lots of up land, and twenty-eight of meadow, set off to him in seve rally. Those who had smaller proportions in the common lands, had a less number of lots ; but in all cases the lots were numerous. All the meadows were divided into small lots, so as to give each proprietor a lot in several meadows. For what purpose this was so done is not known with certainty. Some have supposed the inhabi tants went in companies to make their hay, the better to defend themselves from the Indians. At the close of the description of each proprietor's lands, thus copied into the"], [53, "29 DIVISION OF LANDS. new book, there is a certificate, of which the following is a sample. \" Compared, approved, and confirmed, by the town's committee according to the order of the town. \" Attest, John Morse, Clerk.\" \" Nov. 2d, 1683.\" This book is now in a state of tolerable preservation, nearly the whole being legible. After the copying from the old book was completed, other proprietors' names, and other setting out of lands, were inserted by the proprietors' clerks, till the volume was filled, then other books were used for the like purpose. After the original proprietors, their grantees, heirs, or representatives, had had their house lots, meadows, inter vals and uplands set out to them in severalty, and after considerable portions of land had been sold to purchasers for the purpose of raising money to build a meeting-house, and for other public purposes, much the greater quantity of land still remained common. The proprietors, there fore, proceeded to make further division thereof in propor tion as each had title thereto. At a meeting of the proprietors, held September 5, 1721, by adjournment from April 28, they voted, among other matters, \" That there shall be, as soon as may be, two acres of upland or meadow, at the least, laid out to every person, who stands lawfully entitled to an acre right in the undivided lands in the town of Groton, and he who stands entitled to a five acre right, shall have laid out thereto ten acres of land or meadow, at least, out of the common and undivided land belonging to the proprietors in this town, and so proportionably for him, that has and stands entitled to a greater or lesser right or interest to said common lands ; that is to say, one half of said pro portion to be laid out on the east side, and the other half"], [54, "30 COMMON LANDS. on the west side of Lancaster river, so called, in this town, by the committee, or any two of them, or such as shall be chosen in their place hereafter ; and the said committee are directed to lay out, where the land shall happen to be meaner, and not so valuable, so much more as to make it equal in value in the judgment of the committee to the best ; and the lands so laid out shall be and remain to such person and his assigns forever, when recorded.\" The committee of the proprietors, chosen for this pur pose, proceeded in conformity to this vote to lay out and set off to all proprietors who applied, such quantities of lands, as their respective rights entitled them to. There is a close similarity in their returns. A copy of one, as a specimen, follows. \" Groton, March 23, 1721-2. Then we, the subscri bers, laid out to a fifteen acre right, originally Ralph Read's, now claimed by Cornelius Whitney, fifty-five acres of land lying on the southeast side of pine meadow, the northwest corner .being a great pine by his own meadow, bounded easterly to John Stone's meadow, the northeast corner an oak, the two southerly corners, pines ; all marked for corners ; what is above fifteen acres in quantity being added to make it equal in quality to fifteen acres of the best land in our judgment, allowance being made for a highway through the same, when needed. Said land being fully to satisfy said right in the new di vision of the common on the east side the river.

February 9, 1741, a third division of common lands was ordered, in which the apportionment was half an acre of the best land to a one acre right, or what should be equivalent to the best land, not exceeding four acres of the poorest land. November 14, 1748, a fourth division was made, in which one quarter of an acre of the best land, or its equivalent, not exceeding three acres of the poorest land, was set to a one acre right. The fifth and last division was voted February 4, 1760, in which one quarter of an acre of the best land was set to a one acre right, or an equivalent, not exceeding three acres of the poorest land, to an acre right. It is not to be supposed, that the owners of all the rights received their just and legal proportions of the com mon lands, according to the several divisions ordered. The records show the contrary, especially so of the last division. Numerous complaints were made to the pro prietors at different times, stating that some had received more than their shares ; that others had not received enough ; that the laying out by different committees in terfered with each other, by reason of not knowing the boundaries ; upon which committees were chosen to ex amine and correct mistakes ; but it was impossible that"], [56, "32 MEETING OF PROPRIETORS. exact justice should be done to all. When a small right came by descent upon a large number of heirs, the frac tions were so small, that they were not worth the trouble of looking after them ; and after the lapse of a little time, it was difficult to trace out the true owners. Jonas Prescott, Sen., was early possessed of a thirty-one acre right. Upon his decease, his son, the Hon. Benjamin Prescott, became the proprietor thereof, who made large additions thereto. Upon his death, his son, Col. James Prescott, became the owner, and added largely to them. He dying, his rights came into the possession of his son James, the late Judge of Probate, who, according to docu ments among the records of the proprietors, whose clerk he was for many years, became the owner of nearly three hundred acre rights, or more than one third of all the common lands. Meetings of the proprietors continued to be held after the last division was voted in 1760, at which transcripts of lands laid out by the committee were accepted and re corded, at longer or shorter intervals, (one, of nine years, during the revolutionary war,) till 1829. The last tract of common land known to exist, was laid out to Bulkley Ames, Esq. Another meeting will probably never be holden. The proprietors, after the revolutionary war, styled themselves the proprietors of Old Groton.

This book has long since been divested of its cover, its leaves sep arated, worn and mutilated, so that the whole is not legible. From its hav ing been the only book of records during the Indian wars, and having lost its cover and the leaves laid aside rolled together, it has acquired the name of the \" Indian Roll.\" It seems to have been lost for a time. When the writer first saw it, in the town clerk's office, it was rolled up, and upon the envelope was written, \"The Indian Roll, Found at Dea. Lawrence's, Feb. 21, 1807.\" Those parts of it containing the transcripts of land were copied, as has been stated in the text, by John Morse, in 1683, '84. The parts containing the laying out of highways, were, by vote of the town, passed May 1, 1723, collected into a report and recorded in the second book of town records.

Had the country been an entire forest, as we might have sup posed, encouragement for cutting trees and clearing land might rather have been given, than penalties imposed for felling and lopping. In the year 1665, there was a dispute between the town and John Lawrence, Sen., and it was submitted to the determination of five men. The referees report aud do \" declare, that they do thus determine, that is to say, his proportion of land being first made good according to his grant, we [words illegible] the remainder to be the town's land according as it is now bounded.\" This decision became important in its consequences. It seems that Lawrence had enclosed common or town's land, and that the decision of the referees was against him. But, at a town meeting held 21st of 7th mo. 1665, \" It was this day granted and by vote declared, that John Lawrence shall quietly possess and enjoy a parcel of land now in contro versy, and already within his fence and adjoining his house lot, containing two acres, more or less, bounded, &c., and granted to him as a gratuity.\" \" It is also granted that every inhabitant shall have the like privilege proportionably.\" And to make the matter more explicit, at a town meeting soon after, \" It was this day agreed and voted, that in consideration of a gratuity formerly granted to every inhabitant, agreeable to John Lawrence, Sen. his grant the 21 of the 7 mo. '65, that every man shall have liberty to take up six acres to a twenty acre house lot, and in case it join to his house, every man shall take up proportionably thereunto, excepting such as have either the whole or any part thereof already ; but if more remote, every inhabitant shall have liberty to take up two for one.\""], [60, "36 CONTRACT FOR GRIST-MILL. It may be inferred from these records, that Lawrence was dissatisfied with the determination of the referees, and appealed to the town. The town it seems forgave him the wrong and injury, upon condition that every inhabitant might do the like wrong and injury. These gratuities, sometimes called in succeeding records, \"accommoda tions,\" gave names to a brook, and a highway, near which some of the gratuities were laid out, now called, by con traction, \"'Tuity brook,\" and \" 'Tuity road.\" About this time the inhabitants endeavored to procure the erection of a grist-mill. By a vote passed, they offered to Sergeant James Parker, John Page, James Knap and Thomas Tarbell, twenty acres of land where they might erect a mill ; that the same should not be taxed for the term of twenty years ; that no other person should build another mill, except upon his own land and for his own use only. A contract was accordingly made and record ed, by which the abovenamed individuals covenanted to build a corn-mill upon Sandy Brook, unless \" a more meet place, in the judgment of the workmen, should appear,\" to have it ready to grind by the first of the eleventh month, 1666, to keep it in good repair for twenty years, and \"to grind the town's corn sufficiently,\" taking com mon toll only. But by a vote of the town on the 6th of the fifth month, 1666, the covenanters were released from their obligation. \" At a general town meeting, held 8th, 3d month, 1667, the town having further agitation about a mill for the town, and understanding that Capt. Clark, of Boston, had manifested a willingness to build a mill for the town, it was agreed, and by vote declared, that there should be three men chosen to go to Mr. Clark, and power given unto them at the same meeting, to make a firm agreement with the said Capt. Clark, in the behalf of the town,\" fee. \u00ab and the men chosen by the town as their trustees are"], [61, "37 GRIST-MILL BUILT. Sergeant James Parker, Corporal James Knap, and Benja min Crisp.\" The town clerk was directed to certify to Capt. Clark, that the committee had full power to contract with him in the town's behalf for the building of a mill. But nothing further is found on record about Capt. Clark. At a town meeting, of which the date is illegible, it \" was agreed, and by vote declared, that the land and meadows, granted to John Prescott for to build the town a mill, namely, the five hundred acres of upland, and twenty acres of meadow, together with the mill, should be freed from all town's charges whatsoever, for the space of twenty years ; and this was the vote of the major part of the town that was present at the meeting : these four men manifested dissent at that time, \u2014 Richard Blood, James Fiske, William Longley, and Timothy Allen.\" A committee was then chosen to make the contract, who it is presumed performed the service, and a mill was accordingly built by John Prescott, who belonged to Lan caster, or by his son Jonas, who was afterwards a distin guished inhabitant of Groton. This mill was built in the southerly part of Groton, now the northerly part of Har vard. That School District and section of the town still retains the name of \" Old Mill.\" \" At a town meeting, November 19, 1673, By agree ment of the town, Jonas Prescott is to grind the town's corn for the town every second and every sixth day in every week.\" After King Philip's war, and the resettlement of the town, Jonas Prescott built a mill at Stony brook, near its issue from Forge pond, now in Westford ; and from an expression in the following vote, it may be inferred that the first mill at Harvard was not burned by the Indians, when they destroyed the greatest part of the town. \" June 15, 1680, on a training day, granted unto Jonas Prescott, that he should take up a piece of land at Stony"], [62, "38 SAW-MILL. brook, in reference to the setting up of a mill there ; and he is to take it up on the right hand of the Bay path ad joining to the pond. And he is not to come over the path ; and he is to run from Chelmsford line to the line of Sergeant Knap, and so much as he takes up there, he is to lay down as much again at one of the ends of his land that lies where the mill now standeth, two acres for one at Stony brook ; and he is to be at the charge of taking up and laying down.\" \"At a general town meeting at Groton, June 13, 1681: Then granted to Jonas Prescott liberty to set up his corn mill at Stony brook, on the side next Concord, in any place between the spring and the bridge, and to have liberty to make use of so much and no more of the water, as may sufficiently serve for the said mill ; provided that what damage thereby may be to the town's highway, the said Jonas Prescott shall at his own charge constantly make good.\" \" An agreement made between Jonas Prescott and the town of Groton, that he, the said Prescott, have liberty to set up a saw mill at Stony brook, and to have the use of the stream, upon conditions as followeth : first, that he shall accommodate the town with merchantable boards at sixpence a hundred cheaper than they are sold at any other saw mills, and for town pay, and that the town shall be supplied before any other person ; and he is to have this privilege, until there may appear something that may be of great advantage to the town, by town works or other ways : always provided, the saw mill do not hinder the corn mill.\" Among other instructions given to the Selectmen in the year 1681, is the following, \" 3d. That by reason of the complaint of several in habitants, the Selectmen shall take special care, that Jonas Prescott do fulfil his agreement with the town.\" Previous to the erection of Prescott's mills, an Indian"], [63, "39 ORDER RESPECTING FENCES. by the name of Andrew, sold his weir at Stony brook, as appears by the following record. \" The twenty shillings due to Andrew, the Indian, from the town for his warre at Stony brook, assigned by said Indian to Richard Blood, the said Richard Blood assigns it over to Lieut. James Parker.\" For about twenty years after the first settlement of Groton, until a provincial statute was enacted for \"regu lating fences, cattle, fee,\" the Selectmen exercised large legislative powers on these and other subjects. A few specimens of their orders and decrees follow. \" At a meeting of tbe Selectmen, January 10 \" * * * (probably 1670-1.) \"To the intent we may preserve love and peace in the town, and preserve our corn from unnecessarily being destroyed, it is ordered, according to power given to the Selectmen to make orders according to their best discretion, we order that all the outside fences about all cornfields, orchards, and gardens, in the town shall be a sufficient five rail fence, or that is in the judg ment of the viewers of the fences, equivalent thereto ; and if any man refuse or neglect to make such fences, and thereby occasion either his own or his neighbor's cattle to an ill haunt, which otherwise would be orderly, shall forfeit to the town for every such default, legally proved, as a fine, ten shillings ; and we do expect that the viewers of the fences should attend their duties herein according to law and town order.\" \" At a meeting of the Selectmen, February 12, 1672. Concerning Swine, \u2014 To the end our meadows and corn fields should be preserved from damage, it is ordered, that all swine that go upon the common from three months old and upward, shall be ringed with two sufficient rings in each swine's nose, well put in, and to be ringed by the tenth of March, and so continue, from time to time, till the last of September, and to the end they may be so, we do further order, that the men that are chosen to look"], [64, "40 ORDER RESPECTING SWINE. after swine, shall have sixpence a swine for every swine that they find unringed in the town from three months old and upward, and make it appear legally, that he or they have ringed them already according to this order. \" And further we do order, that if any man's swine in this town take any man's cornfield, being legally proved, the owners of these swine shall forthwith secure them by yoking them or shutting them up, upon penalty of paying double damage, after the first time of damage being done.\" It appears that the cattle were not confined to enclosed pastures, but had the range of the whole country, under the care of herdsmen. \" February 12, 1672. It was this day agreed upon that there shall be three herds; the cattle shall be divided into three herds, the one reaching from Matthias Farns worth's, and so along the neck to James Fiske's and along till we come to Peleg Lawrence's, which herd is to go out by Indian hill, by James Fiske's, and the south side of Rock meadow. The second herd is to begin at Samuel Wood's, taking Nathaniel Lawrence and Thomas Smith, till we come at Thomas Williams and William Longley, taking in John Lakin and his neighbor's cattle ; and they are to go out with their herd by Nathaniel Lawrence's and into Unquetenasset woods, by Sargeant Lakin's, and William Longley's, and Richard Blood's. The third herd to begin at Timothy Cooper's, and along the west side of Broad meadow to Jonathan Sawtell's, taking in the cattle of Richard Holden and Justin, and they likewise are to go into Unquetenasset woods, if they see cause. These several angles are to hire their herdsman, if the major part of any company agreeing thereto, the minor are to submit.\" Not knowing precisely where the houses of the inhabi tants named in this order stood, we cannot define the limits of the several herds. But it is evident that the first"], [65, "41 COMMON POUND. comprised the south part of the town ; the second, the north part ; and the third, the west part ; not, however, extending over Nashua river. These orders were passed by the Selectmen for several years in succession, with very little variation in expression or comprehension. \" At a town meeting held 5 March, 1665-6, the town agreed with John Page, Joseph Gilson, and Daniel Pearce, to make a common pound for the town's use, and they are to have fifty shillings for their pains, to be paid out of the next town rate. The said pound is to be made thirty feet square, six sufficient rails in height, not exceeding ten feet in length, the rails are two of them to be pinned at each end in every length ; they are to make the gate, and to find the irons, and to hang the said gate, with a lock and key for the said gate for the use of the town, for the aforesaid \u00a32 10s. The place to be set up is near the meeting-house.\" 2 About this period it was customary for the town to choose large committees, whose duty it was to instruct the Selectmen in the management of the prudentials of the town. These committees would draw up their in structions, and have them put on record with the trans actions of the town. A few specimens of these instruc tions follow. \" In addition to the former instructions given by the committee chosen by the town in the year 1680, 10th of 10th mo. \" 1.

The first highways laid out were of great and unneces sary width, some of them being six or eight rods wide. The intentions of those, who laid them out, were undoubt edly good, but the consequences were decidedly bad, some of which have continued to the present time. The inhabitants, whose lands bounded on the broad ways, observing the unnecessary waste of good land, were tempted to encroach upon it with their fences. The example of one would be naturally followed by another, and troubles soon arose and have been continued about encroachments upon the highways ever since. Had they been of a proper width only, encroachments would proba bly not have been made so frequently. Committees have been chosen from time to time to see that encroachments should not be made, and to prosecute such as had made them. In other instances committees have been chosen to legalize the encroachments, by selling to individuals the lands they had taken from the highways into their enclosures. November 4, 1734, the town passed the following vote : \" Voted and chose Benjamin Prescott, Nathaniel Saw tell, Esqs., Capt. Sheple, Capt. Lawrence and Benjamin"], [70, "46 SALES OF ROADS.

In the year 1747, a committee was chosen to reckon with the committee who made sale of the highways, and they reported that the last mentioned committee had sold to the amount of one hundred and eighty-two pounds seven shillings and one penny, old tenor. Considering the number of the inhabitants, the dis tance of the place from other settlements,\u2014 Chelmsford, Dunstable, Billerica, Lancaster and Concord being the nearest,\u2014 and the great amount of labor necessary to construct a barely passable road over hills, streams, swamps and bogs, it is hard to conceive how they were able to make the communications and transportations absolutely necessary to provide for their sustenance."], [71, "47 HIGHWAY to chelmsford. As early as July, 1665, a highway had been laid out to Chelmsford, as appears by the following record. \" The country highway being determined between this town and Chelmsford, by a committee chosen respectively by both towns, have agreed, and accordingly laid out the country highway from the meeting-house place in the * * * (old) cartway to Chelmsford meeting-house, six rods in width from place to place.\" This highway was probably where the county road from the first parish meeting-house, over the ridges to Forge village, is now travelled, or near it. \" At a meeting of the Selectmen, January 10, 1672, a committee chosen to meet with Concord men, Chelmsford men, and Robert Blood, to lay out the way to the bay, between this and the spring, where it is most passable ; and the committee are, Major Willard, Sergeant Parker, James Knap.\" \"The Major having not time to attend it, Richard Blood is chosen by the town in his room, March 17, '72-'73.\" This bay road, or road to the bay, as it is called in the records, lay through Chelmsford and Billerica. The bridge over Concord river was built at the expense of Billerica, Chelmsford, Groton, Dracut and Dunstable, and supported jointly by these towns for many years. Two highways from Groton to Lancaster were laid out within a few years after the first settlement. Of the first there is no record,' but the record of the second sufficient ly explains its necessity. \" Wednesday, 4 June, 1673. Forasmuch as the coun try highway, as it was formerly laid out by Lancaster and Groton, upon several years' trial proved to be very insufficient, and very difficult to be made passable, in regard it was for the most part lying in the intervales, wherein there are several soft places and little brooks, 1 Mr. Abel Davis found traces of the first road, a few years since, upon his land, near the mouth of Nonacauicus brook."], [72, "48 HIGHWAY TO LANCASTER. upon which bridges and other matter for making the same passable, are apt to be raised and torn up by the floods, and upon experience of the same, Lancaster made application to Groton for removing the said way to run more upon the upland, which was readily attended, and John Prescott, Sen., and Roger Sumner for Lancaster, and Sergeant Parker and Corporal Knap for Groton, were chosen committees by both towns to lay out the highway as aforesaid ; which was attended the day aforesaid, as followeth, viz., first within the bounds of Groton they take their beginning at their meeting-house, to the mill of Jonas Prescott, by Matthias Farnsworth his house, six rods wide, turning out of the common mill way near twenty rods above the mill, and then it runs four rods wide through the land of the aforesaid Jonas Prescott, according as it is described by trees marked by the men aforesaid, and from the said Jonas Prescott's land to Pen nicook river in Lancaster, through Swan swamp, six rods wide, as it is already marked out by the committee afore said, and from the way aforesaid, butting upon Pennicook near to the night-pasture-wading -place, they take the way as it is left in width through the intervale, and over Nashua bridge, and so on to the meeting-house, and as it is to be understood, that the way in Lancaster bounds runs near the midway between the brook meadow and plum trees meadow, over a hill called Mahancknit's hill, and so along on the upland to the pond path, as it runs near to the still-river-meadow and Josiah White's meadow, until it comes to the Swan swamp path as afore said ; 2 and to the confirmation hereof, the committee 2 The construction of this road was, if made passable for teams, undoubt edly as great a tax upon the inhabitants, considering their wealth and num bers, as that of constructing the Worcester and Nashua rail road, lying near the same route, would now be to the present inhabitants. Will there be as great a change of circumstances in the coming 174 years ?"], [73, "49 BRIDGES. aforesaid have hereunto put their hands, the day and year aforesaid. John Prescott, Roger Sumner, James Parker, James Knap.\" The exact location of this highway is not known ; but by comparing this with other records, it is supposed, that in Groton it passed between the Baptist meeting-house and the common burying-ground, thence on the west side of Broad meadow, as the road now called Farmers' row, runs. Matthias Farnsworth, whose house it passed, is known to have lived on the south side of James's brook, some where near the houses of Ephraim Sawtell and Alva Wright. It probably crossed Sandy brook near Calvin Fletcher's saw mill, and thence followed the course of tbe present road to near the old mill. The Selectmen in 1669 had ordered a sufficient cart bridge to be built over Sandy brook ; and Matthias Farnsworth was in the eleventh month of that year, viz., January, 1670, directed \" to make a sufficient cart bridge over James's brook beneath his own house in that place where the surveyors shall judge it most con venient.\" For the first thirty or forty years after the commence ment of the settlement of Groton, there being no inhabi tants on the west side of Nashua river, a bridge was not needed. The first movement (on record) about having one, is the following. \"At a town meeting legally warned, August 22, 1699, the town did vote, that they would build a cart bridge over Lancaster river at Groton.\" Nothing further appears on the records about this or any bridge over Nashua or Lancaster river in Groton, for eighteen years, when the following vote was passed. \" By the major vote agreed, that they will build a 7"], [74, "50 BRIDGES. bridge over our river ; and also voted that they will have a committee to view the river in order thereto ; the men chosen for this committee are John Sheple, John Ames, Zachariah Sawtell, Joseph Parker, Jr., and John Holden ; and have by the major vote given this committee full power to state the place where the bridge shall stand, not extending up stream above Tarbell's fordway, nor down stream extending the Stony wading-place below Kemp's.\" Tarbell's fordway was between where Fitch's bridge now stands, and the bridge on the road to Squannacook. Stony wading-place is the site of the mills, on the great road to Townsend. The aforementioned committee re port thus. \" Pursuant to said vote, we, the committee, have viewed said river within the bounds and limits aforesaid, in order to perfixing and stating the place where the bridge shall stand over our river aforesaid, and we do all herein agree, and judge for and in behalf of this town of Groton, the best and the most commendable and conve nient place for said bridge to stand, is at a place a little below the place known and called by the name of ' Wal nut run,' across said river at or near a black oak tree, marked on the west side, which stands on the east side of said river, to a young black oak tree, which is on the west side of said river, with a heap of stones about it. As witness our hands.\" Signed by all the committee. It appears that the town did not immediately after this report, proceed to build the bridge ; for at a town meet ing held June 11, 1722, a committee was chosen to answer in court to a complaint for not building a bridge over Lancaster river. And at a meeting, June 25, 1722, the town voted to build another bridge between Squanna cook river and Mulpus brook, and chose two committees of three men each, to build the two bridges. These com mittees proceeded some time in the work assigned them."], [75, "51 BRIDGES. June 10, 1723, the town voted that the committee for building the upper bridge should draw twelve pounds from the treasury for the work, and the other committee eighteen pounds. May 14, 1725. The town chose a committee of three persons to examine the accounts of the two committees for building the bridges. Aug. 27, 1725. The town voted, that the two com mittees might give orders upon the town treasurer to the persons who had worked at the bridges, for the sums due them therefor, and ordered the town clerk to make a copy of all the accounts brought in by said committees. \"Also voted and granted \u00a3159 19s. Id. to discharge the accounts of the two committees.\" And at the same meeting the following vote passed. \" Voted, That Lieut. Boyden, Nathaniel Woods, and William Lawrence, be a committee to recover and take into their possession and custody the irons, plank, and timber, that has been got for, and used about, the bridges erected, or designed to be set up over Nashua river, and dispose thereof, or any part thereof, to the best advantage, the profits arising thereby to be accounted for, and paid to the town ; and the said committee are fully empowered to sue for and recover any such timber, irons, or plank, or other material used about each of said bridges, of any person or persons that have, or shall take or detain the same.\" So the works, after having been prosecuted for two or three years at great expense and labor, are abandoned, and no bridge over the Nashua is yet completed. The next year, March 15, 1725-6, the town voted, that they would build a bridge across Nashua river, but upon the question, whether at the town's expense, the vote was in the negative. Upon the question, whether the town would grant liberty to individuals to build a bridge, the vote was affirmative."], [76, "52 BRIDGES. \" Also voted that John Longley, Jonathan Page, Eph raim Sawtell, William Tarbell, and William Lawrence, with such others as will freely join with them, have liberty to erect and finish the bridge at the place prayed for, viz., between Squannacook and Mulpus brook, where said work has already been begun, provided they do it within two years ; and that for their encouragement therein, they have what hath already been provided for said bridge.\" May 19, 1726. A grant similar to the above was made to Jonathan Page, Samuel Parker, and John Holden, to build a bridge at Walnut run, on the same conditions, and with the same encouragement, as expressed in the above vote. As nothing further about bridges appears on the records for several years, it is inferred that both these bridges were erected and made passable within the two years limited by the above votes. Tant\u00e6 molis erat trans fiumen condere pontem. At a town meeting, May 16, 1740, the town voted, \" that there shall be a bridge built, rebuilt, erected, or set up across Lancaster river, near to Samuel Kemp's, Junior, where a bridge formerly stood,\" &c. Granted the sum of fifty pounds for the purpose, and chose a committee to perform the service, and require of the town of Town send, that they pay part of the expense, and in case Townsend should refuse, that the representative of Groton in the General Court should petition to have them com pelled to do it. But the next year, November 24, 1741, it was \" voted to rebuild the bridge across Lancaster river at the Walnut run, or where the last bridge last stood.\" They also voted forty pounds for the purpose, and chose Ezra Farnsworth, Samuel Tarbell and Joseph Whitney, a committee to rebuild, and \"to take care of the materials of the old bridge.\" So it appears that nothing was effected"], [77, "53 BRIDGES. pursuant to the votes of May 16, 1740, as Samuel Kemp's, Jr., and Walnut run, mean one and the same place. And it seems by the following vote that the bridge was not rebuilt till the next year. \" At a town meeting, August 24, 1742, voted, that the great bridge by Kemp's (so called) be raised at the town's cost \u2014 the committee appointed to build said bridge, to call such persons to raise said bridge as they shall think fit. And all such persons as are assisting in raising said bridge, shall be allowed the sum of five shillings, old tenor, each man, per day, and a dram.\" A bridge was built about this time at Stony wading place ; for August 29, 1743, a committee was chosen to repair it. Among the records of 1750, is the following. \" The town taking into consideration the great and heavy charge they labor under, and in particular to main tain so many cart bridges over such a large and rapid river as Lancaster river is ; and it appearing to the said town, that the bridge at the Walnut run, so called, is much the less used by the inhabitants of the said town than any one of the others, that are built across said river ; but inasmuch as there is a country road laid out to, from, and over said bridge, which leads to Townsend line, so that the said town can't change or discontinue said road, or any part thereof; and whereas we have two other bridges on each side of the aforesaid bridge, and we have or can make convenient roads to each of said bridges to accommodate the inhabitants of Townsend and others, that have occasion to travel that way ; therefore voted, that William Lawrence, Esq., Capt. Samuel Tarbell and Capt. John Bulkley, be a committee to make application to the Court of General Sessions of the Peace for the county of Middlesex, to get part of the road leading to Townsend exchanged, so as to lead or go over some of the other bridges, and the aforesaid bridge at the Walnut"], [78, "54 BRIDGES. run, so called, discontinued ; or that the town of Town send be obliged to help maintain it.\" By this it appears, that the number of bridges over Lancaster river, in Groton, in 1750, was the same as at present ; and they all stood at the same places, except, perhaps, the bridge at the Walnut run stood farther up the river, than Fitch's bridge now stands. In May, 1751, a committee was chosen to repair the bridge at Wood's fordway, viz., where the bridge now stands, on the road leading to Squannacook ; and in March, 1753, mention is made of repairing the bridge near Blood's fordway, which is now called Jewett's bridge. After Pepperell had become a district, there being two bridges, one half of each of which being in said district, and the other half in Groton, the following agreement was made and has been fulfilled by the parties thereto, to the present time. \" Articles of agreement made and concluded upon, by and between William Lawrence, Esq., Samuel Tarbell, Gent., and Joseph Stone, Yeoman, all of Groton, a com mittee for said town on the one party, and Peleg Law rence, David Shattuck and Nehemiah Hobart, Yeomen, a committee for the district of Pepperell, on the other party, all in the county of Middlesex, witnesseth, that whereas there are two cart bridges now built or erected over and across Lancaster river, which are built between the said town of Groton, and the district of Pepperell, viz., one at the Stony wading-place, so called, the other a little below Joseph Blood's fordway, so called, and whereas the said town of Groton and the said district are obliged to main tain the said bridges to the middle of the river, each on their own side, and inasmuch as it hath been considered by the said town and district, that it may become advan tageous for both, for one to do all to one, and the other all to the other, therefore, we, the said William Lawrence, Samuel Tarbell, and Joseph Stone, in our said capacity"], [79, "55 BRIDGES. of a committee for said town, do covenant and agree with the said Peleg Lawrence, David Shattuck, and Nehemiah Hobart, a committee for said district, that the said town of Groton shall from time to time, mend, maintain and keep in good repair, the bridge called the Stony wading place bridge, so long as the county road shall be con tinued there ; and the said district of Pepperell shall keep up and maintain a good cart bridge, where it is now, a little below Joseph Blood's fordway, so called ; and at all times keep the said Stony wading-place bridge in so good repair as to secure the said district from any charge by reason of a presentment by the grand jury, fee, always provided, that in case there should be a presentment against the said district, then the said district to give the said town of Groton, or such person as they shall desire to appear and make answer thereto, full power to answer; and for want of such power, the said town of Groton shall be free from any charge on that account ; neither is it to be understood, that said town of Groton are to be held to make or maintain the said Stony wading-place bridge any longer than the said district make or maintain a good bridge near Blood's fordway, as aforesaid. For the true performance of the covenants and agreements aforesaid, we, the said parties, have set to our hands and seals, this 16th day of September, 1754. In the 28th year of his majesty's reign.\" Signed, sealed, fee. At a town meeting in May, 1760, the town chose a committee to petition the General Court for leave to raise by a lottery a reasonable sum of money to maintain four bridges over Lancaster river, between Groton and the districts of Pepperell and Shirley, and one great bridge over Squannacook river at the mills. The bridge at Walnut run was omitted in this vote, but for what reason, does not appear. For many years after this period, persons were annually"], [80, "56 RRIDGES. chosen to inspect and repair the great bridges ; one, the upper, or Page's bridge, one, that at Wood's fordway, and one, that at Stony wading-place. That at Walnut run, or Kemp's, now Fitch's bridge, was maintained by a few inhabitants, who were particularly accommodated by it. Afterwards the Selectmen were annually chosen for that purpose. In September, 1771, an article was inserted in the war rant for a town meeting, \" to choose some proper person or persons to view, mark, and purchase any such timber, as may be thought proper for the use of the great bridges across the river,\" and such committee was thereupon chosen. This was probably done under the apprehension that such timber would soon be scarce. In May, 1772, Col. Prescott, Dr. Prescott, and Capt. Amos Lawrence, were chosen to petition the General Court for relief about the bridges ; but it does not appear that any relief was granted. In the warrant for town meeting, October, 1779, the twelfth article was this. \" To see if the town will keep the bridge over the river at Kemp's fordway in good repair for the future, or make the proprietors thereof any allowance for the same.\" Thereupon \" Voted, That Capt. Fitch, Samuel Hemenway, John Simonds, James Adams, Caleb Blood, and Jacob Gragg, (persons living on the west side of the river,) be excused from any proportion of the highway taxes in this town in future, so long as they shall agree to keep in repair the bridge mentioned in the 12th article.\" In April, 1803, Capt. Zachariah Fitch proposed to the town, that he would support the bridge and the two highways leading from it on the easterly side of the river the distance of twenty rods, for the sum of thirty dollars per annum, which proposition the town accepted. In 1806 a committee was chosen to consider and report"], [81, "57 BRIDGES. what was expedient relating to the support of that bridge, who reported that Capt. Fitch ought in justice to have a grant of thirty dollars, to make present repairs, and in ad dition to thirty dollars annually, his proportion of the highway tax in future. This report was accepted. Capt. Fitch and his heirs have supported said bridge ever since. It is notorious, that the burden of making and support ing highways and bridges falls very unequally upon towns, in proportion to their wealth and population. The towns of Billerica, Concord, Framingham, Groton, Stow, Sudbury and Wayland, in the county of Middlesex, are at more expense for bridges, than other towns in the county. Various movements have been made by those oppressed in this particular, such as appear by the fore going votes of Groton, to obtain relief, and equalize the expenses, but none have been permanently successful. Besides the five bridges over Nashua, and one over Squannacook rivers, within the bounds and upon the limits of Groton, there are two over Cow-pond brook, one over Nonacauicus, one over Sandy, one over Unquetenas set, and nine over James's brook, besides many others over smaller streams. The whole length of highways is about one hundred miles. 8"], [82, "CHAPTER V.

The original grant of the plantation or township of Groton, as has been stated in Chapter L, was a territory comprising sixty-four square miles, or 40,960 acres. By the incorporations of Shirley and Pepperell, and by setting off parcels to other adjoining towns, Groton is now re duced to a territory of about thirty-six square miles, or a little more than a moiety of its original size. The first dismemberment took place in the year 1715, when Nashobah was incorporated a town by the name of Littleton, and a large portion of Groton at the south-east part, was included within the bounds of the new town.

An Act of the Legislature passed in the year 1786, made all districts which had been incorporated previous to 1777, towns, without any special Acts for each, by which Act Shirley and Pepperell became towns.4 By an Act of the Legislature, passed February 25, 1793, on the petition of sundry inhabitants of the north part of Groton, about twenty families with their estates were taken from Groton and annexed to Dunstable. By this the jurisdictional line between the two towns formed eighty-six angles, and was attended with much inconve nience. It continued, however, to be the boundary line till February 15, 1820, when by another Act a line was established, taking one family and a considerable territory from Groton aud annexing it to Dunstable, and forming but five angles. 4 From and after 1775, Shirley and Pepperell each chose representatives to the General Court, separate from Groton, and made their records as towns ; but by what authority, I know not.

Lastly, by an Act passed February 3, 1803, four acres and twenty rods of land on the west side of Nashua river near Fitch's bridge, were taken from Pepperell and an nexed to Groton.

Of all the embarrassments, difficulties and discourage ments, which the early settlers of Groton had to encoun ter, those arising from the hostility of the aborigines, na tives, or Indians, as they are more commonly called, were by far the most appalling and distressing. For the term of about fifteen years, however, after the settlement com menced, it being a time of peace between the Massachu setts colony and the Indians, nothing appears on record, that the settlers suffered or felt any alarm from their savage neighbors. But during this very period, Metacom, by the English named Philip, a sachem of the Wampa noags, a tribe inhabiting some part of the State of Rhode Island, a courageous warrior, possessing a sagacity and foresight not common in a savage, had conceived, and was cautiously maturing a plan to extirpate the European population of New England. He rightly judged, that if the settlements by foreigners progressed as they had done, and were then doing, the rightful proprietors of the soil"], [93, "Philip's plan of war. 69 must rapidly fly before the usurpers, or suffer extermina tion. He, therefore, in order to prevent what has long since happened, endeavored to unite the various tribes in and about New England in a plan to make a general and simultaneous attack upon the new settlers, and if possible, destroy them at once. He concealed his designs as well as he could from his intended victims. But one Sausa man, an Indian, who was friendly to the whites, knowing the intentions of Philip, disclosed them; and for that kind act was soon after killed by the Wampanoags. Where upon three of his murderers were seized by the English of Plymouth colony, tried, convicted, condemned and executed. Philip himself was charged with being an accomplice, and not attempting to disprove the charge, it was thought he was guilty. Finding now that his plans were known to those upon whom they were intended to be executed, he no longer practised deception, but though unprepared for the contest, commenced open war. But for the disclosures of the unfortunate Sausaman, and for his commencing hostilities before his allies were fully prepared to join in the attack, he might probably have succeeded in his enterprise. Though the laws of the Colonies forbade selling fire arms and ammunition to the Indians, they had not been strictly obeyed, and the French at Canada, and the Dutch at New York, had trafficked with them in these articles; a French baron in particular residing in Penobscot had sup plied them, so that at this time they had a considerable supply of guns, and had learned to use them expertly. The numbers of those combined in Philip's plot for ex termination, cannot be estimated with any great degree of certainty. The whole number of white inhabitants at that time in New England has been estimated at one hundred and twenty thousand ; about the same number that our county of Middlesex alone now contains. Had they all dwelt on a territory not larger than Middlesex,"], [94, "70 WAR COMMENCED. they could have defended themselves with less expense, and have suffered less than they did, being scattered over a country now comprising five States of the Union. This calamitous war commenced June 24, 1675, at Swanzey, now in the county of Norfolk. The Indians began by rifling some houses, killing some cattle, and menacing the inhabitants ; whereupon one of them was shot, and immediately eight or nine of the whites were killed. Brookfield, Mendon, Lancaster, Sudbury, Marl borough, Groton, and other towns of Massachusetts, were soon after the scenes of fire, slaughter, captivity, torture and sufferings, of which we at this time can give no ade quate description. The events of this savage war will be narrated no farther than they have some connection with the settlement at Groton.

Besides the incumbrance lying upon us for quarters for horse and men, besides the drawing up of our men from several towns to such a limit seems to carry in convenience with it ; the towns from whence our forces are raised, especially Chelmsford and Billerica, being weak and in want of more strength at home, and danger occur ing to them, by the sudden and suspicious removal of the Weymessit Indians, whose troopers do hereupon desire a release.

We might add the great discontent and mourning of the people in general, so far as we have had opportunity to discourse concerning it, that we fear the imposing of such a thing would effect an ill consequence. These things considered, besides several other reasons of weight, that might be added, cause us to present our apprehensions, as in the first place we did, that the drawing of this line at this time is not admissible : but all with humble submis sion to your honors in the case. \" Your humble servants, Hugh Mason, Jonathan Danforth, Richard Lowdon.\""], [99, "APPORTIONMENT OF SOLDIERS. 75 Weymessit, named in the above report, was where the city of Lowell now stands.

Sill was sent with a small party of"], [101, "77 FIRST AND SECOND ATTACK. dragoons, of eight files, to fetch off the inhabitants of Groton, and what was left from the spoil of the enemy, having under his conduct about sixty carts, being in depth from front to rear above two miles, when a party of In dians lying in ambush, at a place of eminent advantage, fired upon the front and mortally wounded two of the first carriers, who both died the next night, [and would] (had God permitted) have done eminent damage to the whole body, it being a full hour before the whole body could be drawn up, which was done with care and courage ; but the Indians, after a few more shot made without doing harm, retired, and made no further assault upon them, being the same party of Indians which the day before had burnt some part of Chelmsford. Soon after, this village was deserted and destroyed by the enemy, yet it was a special providence, that though the carts were guarded with so slender a convoy, yet there was not any considerable loss sustained. \" The surprisal of Groton was after this manner. On the 2d, the Indians came in the night and rifled eight or nine houses, and carried away some cattle, and alarmed the town. \" On March 9th, about ten in the morning, a parcel of Indians, (having two days lurked in the town, and taken possession of three out-houses, and feasted themselves with corn, divers swine and poultry, which they there seized,) laid an ambush for two carts, which went from their garrison to fetch in some hay, attended with four men, two of whom espying the enemy, made a difficult escape, the other two were set upon, and one of them slain, stripped naked, his body mangled and dragged into the highway, and laid on his back in a most shameful manner ; the other taken captive and sentenced to death, but the enemy not concurring in the manner of it, execu tion was deferred, and he by the providence of God es caped by a bold attempt the night before he was designed"], [102, "78 THIRD ATTACK. to have been slaughtered, and fled to the garrison at Lan caster, the cattle in both towns wounded and five of them slain. \" March 13, was the day when the enemy came in a full body, by their own account four hundred, and thought by the inhabitants to be not many less. The town was at this time (having been put into a fright by the sad catastrophe of Lancaster, the next bordering town) gathered into five garrisons, four of which were so near together, as to be able to command from one to the other, between which were the cattle belonging to those families driven into pastures, which afterwards proved their pre servation ; the other was near a mile distant from the rest. \" This morning the Indians (having in the night placed themselves in several parts of the town) made their onset, which began near the four garrisons ; for a body of them having placed themselves in ambuscade behind a hill near one of the garrisons, two then made discovery of them selves, as if they stood upon discovery. At this time divers of the people, not suspecting any such matter, (for the day before many had been upon discovery many miles, and found no signs of an enemy being so near,) were attending their occasions, some foddering their cattle, some milking their cows, of whom the enemy might easily have made a seizure, but God prevented ; they having another design in hand, as soon after appeared. These two Indians were at length espied, and the alarm given ; whereupon the most of the men in the next gar rison, and some also in the second, (which was about eight or nine poles distant,) drew out and went to surprise those two Indians, till our men reached the brow of the hill, then arose the ambush and discharged a volley upon them, which caused a disorderly retreat, or rather a rout, in which one was slain and three others wounded. Mean while another ambuscade had arisen, and come upon the back side of the garrison so deserted of men, and pulled"], [103, "THE TOWN BURNT. 79 down the palisadoes. The soldiery in this rout retreated not to their own, but passed by to the next garrison, the women and children meanwhile exposed to hazard, but by the goodness of God made a safe escape to the other fortified house, without any harm, leaving their substance to the enemy, who made a prey of it, and spent the resi due of the day in removing the corn and household stuff (in which loss five families were impoverished) and firing upon the other garrison. Here also they took some cattle. No sooner was the signal given by the first volley of shot, but immediately in several parts of the town at once, did the smoke arise, they firing the houses. In the afternoon they used a stratagem not unlike the other, to have sur prised the single garrison, but God prevented. An old Indian (if an Indian) passed along the street with a black sheep on his back, with a slow pace, as one decrepid. They made several shot at him, at which several issued out to have taken him alive, but the watchman, seasona bly espying an ambush behind the house, gave the signal, whereby they were preserved. \" The night following, the enemy lodged in the town, some of them in the garrison they had surprised, but the body of them in an adjacent valley, where they made themselves merry after their savage manner. The next morning they gave two or three volleys at Capt. Parker's garrison, and so marched off, fearing, as was thought, that a supply might be nigh at hand. \" This assault of theirs was managed with their wonted subtlety and barbarous cruelty, for they stripped the body of him whom they had slain in the first onset, and then cutting off his head, fixed it upon a pole looking towards his own land. The corpse of the man slain the week before, they dug up out of his grave, they cut off his head and one leg, and set them upon poles, and stripped off his winding sheet. An infant, which they found dead in the house first surprised, they cut in pieces, which afterward"], [104, "80 BOASTING OF MONOCO. they cast to the swine. There were about forty dwelling houses burnt at that time, besides other buildings. This desolation was followed with the breaking up of the town and scattering of the inhabitants, and removal of the candlestick, after it had been there seated above twelve years. \" Concerning the surprisal of Groton, March 13, there was not any thing much more material, than what is already mentioned, save only the insolency of John Monoco, or one eyed John, the chief captain of the In dians in that design ; who having by a sudden surprisal early in the morning seized upon a garrison house in one end of the town, continued in it, plundering what was there ready at hand all that day, and at night did very familiarly in appearance, call out to Capt. Parker, that was lodged in another garrison house, and entertained a great deal of discourse with him, whom he called his old neighbor, dilating upon the cause of the war, and putting an end to it by a friendly peace, yet oft mixing bitter sarcasms with several blasphemous scoffs and taunts, at their praying and worshipping God in the meeting-house, which he deridingly said he had burnt. Among other things, which he boastingly uttered that night, he said he burnt Medfield, (though it be not known whether he was there personally present or no,) Lancaster, and that now he would burn that town of Groton, and the next time he would burn Chelmsford, Concord, Watertown, Cam bridge, Charlestown, Roxbury, Boston, adding at last in their dialect, What me will, me do. Not much unlike the proud Assyrian (if his power had been equal to his pride) sometimes threatened against Jerusalem, but was by the remarkable providence of God, so confounded within a few months after, that he was bereft of his four hundred and four score, (of which he now boasted,) and only with a few more braggadocios like himself, Sagamore Sam, Old Jethro, and the Sagamore of Q,uaboag, were taken by"], [105, "81 M0N0C0 HUNG. the English, and was seen (not long before the writing of this) marching towards the gallows, (through Boston streets which he threatened to burn at his pleasure,) with an halter about his neck, with which he was hanged at the town's end, Sept. 26, in this present year, 1676.1 \" After this, April 17th, Capt. Sill being appointed to keep garrison at Groton, some Indians coming to hunt for swine, three Indians drew near to the garrison house, supposing it to have been deserted, were two of them slain by one single shot, made by the Captain's own hands, and the third by another shot made from the garrison.\" It would be gratifying to be able to identify the spots where the principal events of this narrative transpired ; where stood the four garrisons, or garrisoned houses, which stood within call of each other, and where the one nearly a mile distant, which was the one taken by the enemy, and from which Monoco held converse with Capt. Parker ; behind what hill the ambush lay on the morning 1 In order to make this narrative consistent with itself, as to time and a regular succession of events, as they happened, conjecture and explanations are necessary. It seems there were three attacks upon Groton, one on the second of March, one on the ninth, and the third and principal one on the thirteenth. On the second of March they rifled houses, carried away cattle, &c.; on the ninth, feasted on swine, poultry, &c, killed one man, and made another cap tive, who afterwards escaped to Lancaster ; and on the thirteenth they burnt the town, killed one man, and wounded three. After this, the inhabitants removed to Concord. The words in the first paragraph, under date of March second, \"the next day over night,\" are evidently a misprint. Major Willard with seventy horse, and forty foot, from Watertown, could not have come to the relief of the town upon such short notice. Besides, it is said, \" the Indians had all fled, having burnt all the houses in town, except four garri sons.\" Now this did not happen till the thirteenth. Suppose we read instead of \"next day over night\" next day fortnight; then would Major Willard have come on the seventeenth, when, to be sure, the Indians had all fled. The first paragraph gives only the general result of the principal attack, and the particulars of the removal of the inhabitants. Then, in the second paragraph, the author gives the account of the first attack, and in the 11"], [106, "82 LOCALITIES OF GARRISONS. of the thirteenth, and in what valley the enemy revelled the night after. But these particulars are forever hidden from us and posterity. Such localities, however, are still known, as show nearly where some of the transactions happened, and after careful observation we may conjec ture, with more or less confidence, where others took place. For instance, it is known that Capt. Parker's house lot was the land now owned by Dr. A. Bancroft and his son, on both sides of the great road, and his house probably stood as near the brook as was convenient. John Nutting's house lot joined Parker's on the north side of the brook, and his house might be within \"eight or nine poles \" of Parker's, at or near the house of Aaron Perkins. Mr. Willard, the minister, owned the house lot south of Parker's, and tradition places his garrison on the land of Jonathan Loring, partly between his house and the road. Here then were the sites of three of the four garrisons. Nutting's must have been the one from which the men went out to take the two Indians, who discovered third paragraph, under date of March 9, the particulars of the second attack ; the last clause in this paragraph seems to have no connection with the rest. Then follow the particulars of the third attack, on the thirteenth, and the departure of the enemy on the fourteenth. The \"place of eminent advan tage,\" where the Indians fired on the teams which were carrying off the inhabitants, under Capt Sill, is said to be the \" ridges.\" A story is still occasionally told in relation to this place. It is said, that travellers, when crossing the ridges in ihe night time, frequently heard the cries and screams of women and children, reminding them of this attack upon the retreating inhabitants in former times. It once happened that Col. James Prescott, on returning from Boston late on a fine moon-shining night, when he came to this place, happened to think of the tales so often told about the \" cries and screams \" there heard, and could not forbear to listen a little, that he might himself be a witness of the fact. He soon heard the usual noise ; but unwil ling to be simply a confirmer of what others had told, he determined to know more of tbe matter; so tying his horse, he proceeded in the direction of the cries, till coming to the small pond on the north side the ridge road, he found the noise still onward. He went round to the north side of the pond, when by the aid of the full moon he was enabled to discover, not the ghosts of the women and children, who in olden time had there been frightened into shades, but a litter of young minks."], [107, "DANIEL ADAMS'S PETITION. 83 themselves, and in their flight passed by to that of Capt.

It is easy to conceive, then, that the ambush lay behind the hill on Dr. Ban croft's land, formerly covered with pines, that the two Iudians discovered themselves on that hill, being nearer to Nutting's garrison than Parker's. And where was the \" adjacent valley,\" in which the Indians made themselves merry the night after, but on the land of the Rev. C. Walker, easterly of his house ? The following copies of original documents corroborate the above conjectures. \" To the right Honorable the Governor and Council sitting in Boston. \" The petition of Daniel Adams humbly showeth, that the petitioner went out as a volunteer upon the scout from Concord, in company with some of Concord and some of Lancaster, and they coming to Groton, your pe titioner there killed an Indian, and hath received no wages from the country for any service that he hath done ; notwithstanding he hath been out upon the same account several times both the last summer and the last winter, and is now going out again under the command of Lieut.

The distance from Mr. Willard's garrison, sup posing it stood on Jonathan Loring's land, is not too great to be within gunshot. If the whole number of whites killed at Groton, during Philip's war, are enumerated in the foregoing accounts, as probably they are, the loss of life was not so great at this place as in many others. The whole number of English killed and lost in New England during this war, is esti mated by Hoit at six hundred, twelve or thirteen towns destroyed, and six hundred buildings, mostly dwelling houses, burnt. Dr. TrumbulPs estimate, in every partic-"], [109, "85 PEACE RESTORED. ular, is higher. He concludes that about one fencible man in every eleven was killed, every eleventh family burnt out, or that one eleventh part of the whole militia and of all the buildings were swept off by the war. The pious writers of those days complain bitterly of the cruelties of the savages in their manner of conducting the war, and treatment of captives. \" Hell hounds,\" and \" devil's imps,\" are epithets freely bestowed upon them ; but an attentive and candid examiner of the history of the times, and of all the circumstances of the case, espe cially after reading the account of the \" swamp fight,\" in Rhode Island, in December, 1675, against the Narragan setts, will find, that if retaliation is allowable in war to all but Christian warriors, no just cause of complaint can be found on account of the destruction of our villages by fire or otherwise ; or for tortures inflicted upon old age, women and children. King Philip having been killed, and most of his war riors either killed, taken, or dispersed, a welcome peace was restored to this part of the province. Many of the inhabitants of Groton had resided in Concord from the breaking up of the settlement to the return of peace. The following is a copy from the Indian roll, aforemen tioned, being the first record made after the choice of town officers, in December, 1675, a term of two years. \" At a general town meeting of the inhabitants of Groton, warned by Capt.

It would gratify curiosity to know the sites of these several garrison houses, and where each family lived, (for it is presumed that the above schedules contain every family in the town,) but this can be stated only in a general and imperfect manner.

Cotton Mather, who wrote near the close of it, has the following. \" On July 27, (1694,) about break of day, Groton felt some surprising blows from Indian hatchets. They began their attacks at the house of one Lieutenant Lakin, in the out skirts of the town, but met with a repulse there, and lost one of their crew. Nevertheless, in other parts of that plantation, (where the good people had become so tired out as to lay down their military watch,) there were more than twenty persons killed, and more than a dozen carried away. Mr. Gershom Hobart, the minister of the place, with part of his family, was remarkably preserved from falling into their hands, when they made themselves the masters of his house, though they took two of his children, whereof the one was killed, and the other some time after happily rescued out of his captivity.\" Among the killed were William Longley, his wife, four or five of their children, and two children of Alexander Rouse, a near neighbor. Among the captives was John Longley, a small boy, son of William. Mr. Longley was a large proprietor of lands, a respecta ble townsman, and town clerk at the time of his death. Records of town meetings, held June 6, and 23, and July 19, of that year, are in his hand writing in the Indian roll. His house stood upon a small knoll a few rods south of the house where John Lawrence lived and died. A small stone, even with the surface of the ground, under a stinted apple tree, near the site of the dwelling house, is the only monument to mark the spot, where the bodies of this family were buried. How far length of time has corrupted, marred, or exaggerated the tradition respecting the slaugh ter of this family, can never be known. As told by the oldest people now living, the story is as follows. The Indians, having lurked about the premises undis-"], [118, "94 JOHN LONGLEY RANSONMED. covered, the day previous to the slaughter, watching a favorable opportunity to effect their purpose, early in the morning of the fatal day turned the cattle out of the barn yard into a cornfield, and lay in ambush. This trick had the desired effect, to draw out some of the family, prob ably Mr. Longley and his sons, unarmed, to drive the cattle from the corn. The Indians then rose upon them, and either killed or took captive the whole family. It is said, however, that a daughter, Jemima by name, whom they had tomahawked and scalped, was found alive, sit ting upon a rock, and that she survived many years, was married and had children. John, the lad before men tioned, was carried to Canada, where he remained with his savage captivators for five years. His relatives at length ransomed him, but he had became so accustomed to savage life, that he left it with reluctance, and those who brought him away, were obliged to use force to accomplish their mission. It is further said of this lad, that after the Indians had proceeded some way from the place, and had made a halt, he told them that his father's sheep were shut up in the barn, and would there starve, but if they would permit him to go back, he would turn them out and return, and they consenting, he fulfilled his promise. He was afterwards a respectable inhabitant of Groton, holding many offices of honor and trust, in town and church, and represented the town in General Court. Gershom, son of the Rev. Mr. Hobart, whom Mather mentions as having been rescued from captivity, is said to have been carried to the eastward. The first information his friends received of him, was in May following his captivity, \" at a fort a day's journey above Norridgwog, and his master's name was Nassacumbewit,\" the chief captain of the place. Both his master and mistress were kind to him, and afterwards granted his ransom."], [119, "95 PETITION AND ANSWER. Mather farther says, that in June, 1697, one man was killed at Groton, and another with two children carried into captivity. After the calamity of July 27, 1694, it appears that the inhabitants of Groton petitioned the General Court for relief and assistance, and thereupon the following order passed. \" Upon reading the petition of the inhabitants of Groton, setting forth their great distress and impoverish ment, by reason of the desolations made upon them by the enemy, praying to be eased and abated of their pro portion of the last public tax assessment, amounting to the sum of fifty pounds. \"Voted, That the said town be abated one half of the aforesaid sum of fifty pounds, and that Mr. Treasurer do suspend the calling in the other half until the fifteenth day of December next.

But upon the acces sion of Queen Anne to the throne of Great Britain, a war with France ensued, and of course their colonies in America were involved in the general contest between the two nations. In 1704, the frontier towns in Massachu setts were again exposed to tomahawks, scalping knives, fire and torture."], [120, "96 QUEEN ANNE'S WAR. The following extracts are from Penhallow's \" Wars of New England.\" \" August, 1704. Some afterwards fell on Lancaster and Groton, where they did some spoil, but not what they expected, for that these were seasonably strengthened.\" \" Captains Prescott, Bulkley, and Willard, with their companies, were so intent upon pursuing the enemy, that they put them all to flight, and yet a little while after they fell on Groton and Nashua, where they killed Lieutenant Wyler [Wilder ?] and several more. It was not then known how many of the enemy were slain, it being customary among them to carry off their dead. However, it was afterwards affirmed that they lost six teen, besides several that were wounded.\" \" July 1706. Several strokes were afterwards made on Chelmsford, Sudbury and Groton, where three sol diers, as they were going to public worship, were waylaid by a small party, who killed two and made the other a prisoner. \"July 21, 1706. John Myrick, Nathaniel Healy, and Ebenezer Leger, of Newton, were killed by the Indians at Groton.\" Besides these instances of alarm, attack and suffering from a savage foe, others are known to have occurred, of which there is more or less authentic evidence. One, of which the tradition is undoubtedly nearly correct, is that of two lads, John Tarbell and Zachariah Tarbell, brothers, and sons of Thomas Tarbell, who were taken and carried to Canada. The story runs thus. One eve ning, a little after sunsetting, the Indians came suddenly upon the inmates of a garrisoned house, which stood where the Rev. Mr. Sanderson's house now stands, or near that spot. They all escaped and got safely into the garrison, except these boys, who being on a cherry tree, had not sufficient time to descend and save themselves from captivity. The precise time of this event is not"], [121, "SHATTUCKS AND SHEPLES KILLED. 97 known, but it is said Zachariah was so young, that he entirely lost his native language, and the records of Groton show, that John was born July 6, 1695, and Zachariah January 25, 1700. So it was probably be tween 1704 and 1708. Some years after, they both came to Groton on a visit, but having become accustomed to savage life, no persuasion prevailed on them to return and live with their friends and relatives. The present inhabitants of that name are their collateral kindred. Their descendants are still among the Indians in Canada. Another well attested fact is, that John Shattuck, and his son John, a young man about twenty years of age, were killed by the Indians when returning from their field, May 8, 1709. At another time the Indians attacked and burnt the house of a Mr. Sheple, killed him and his family, except his son John, whom they carried into captivity, where he remained about four years. During his residence with the savages, he became so well acquainted with then language and customs, that he could in after life deal and traffic with them to better advantage to himself than others could, who were not so well acquainted with them.4 During the time of Queen Anne's war, the town records are very scanty ; and no allusion is made in them to the distresses and sufferings from the enemy except the following, viz. \"Groton, May 8, 1706. At a town meeting legally warned, they did by vote declare, they would and do de sire that Thomas Chamberlain's mill may be upheld by a soldier, or soldiers, for the good of the town, by a peti tion to the Court or authority.\" 4 It is matter of tradition, that \" John Sheple's foot weighed just a pound,\" in allusion to his putting his foot in one scale of the balance, when weighing the Indians' furs and skins. 13"], [122, "98 DESIGNS OF ABANDONING THE TOWN.

The following are copies of documents in the office of the Secretary of the Common wealth. \" To his Excellency the Governor, at Roxbury, (in her Majesty's service.) \"On a lecture day, Groton, July 9, 1707.

Those towns which had during the \u2022former wars been frontiers, being no longer exposed to sudden incursions of the enemy, became more populous."], [124, "100 lovell's war. But by the instigation of a Jesuit priest, of the name of Ralle, residing with the Indians at Norridgewock, in 1722, the \" three years' or Lovell's war \" commenced, and the customary mode of falling suddenly upon the settlements, killing and carrying captive to Canada, was pursued by the enemy. In the summer of 1723, one man was killed at Groton. Massachusetts resolved to re taliate upon the Indians in their own mode of warfare, attack them at their residence, in Norridgewock, and put an end to the machinations of Ralle. Two hundred and eight men were put under the command of Captains Harman and Moulton, who proceeded with this force up the Kennebec river, came suddenly upon the village, killed Ralle and many of the Indians, some supposed about eighty, and burnt their habitations. The governments of Massachusetts and New Hamp shire about this time offered a bounty of one hundred pounds 5 for every Indian's scalp, which should be taken and exhibited to the proper authorities. This inhuman expedient induced adventurers to make excursions into the wilderness to seek for gain, as well as renown. Vol unteer companies were formed, who scoured the country in search of Indians, so that the war altogether resembled the hunting of ravenous beasts. Among those who engaged in this dangerous and difficult species of warfare, Capt. John Lovell, or Lovewell, of Dunstable, and his company of volunteers from Billerica, Concord, Groton, Haverhill, Dunstable and Woburn, eminently distinguished themselves. As six of this devoted band were inhabitants of Groton, one of whom immortalized his name by killing Paugus, the chief of the Pequawket tribe, the oft-told story of \" Lovell's Fight \" must not be omitted in an account of the wars of Groton. Capt. Lovell made three several excursions into the enemies' country. In the first, he left the settlements in 5 The currency at this time being two and a half for one in sterling."], [125, "101 first and second expeditions. December, 1724, with a company of thirty men. Pro ceeding northward of Lake Winnipisiogee, in New Hamp shire, they found two Indians in a wigwam, one of whom they killed, the other, a small lad, they brought in alive. On exhibiting the scalp and captive at Boston, they re ceived not only the stipulated bounty, but a handsome gratuity. Thus encouraged, the company being increased to the number of seventy, went out on a second expedi tion, in February, 1725. Passing by the wigwam, they saw the body of the Indian killed two months before. Their provisions becoming short, thirty of their number were selected by lot and sent home. The remainder, prosecuting the expedition still further, at length came upon the track of the game they were hunting for. Fol lowing the trail till near evening, and coming to a height of land, they discovered a smoke ahead, which proceeded from the encampment of the Indians. They made a halt, and returned into a valley and encamped. Lovell and one of his men went and reconnoitred the Indians' camp. About midnight, the whole company went forward to the slaughter, having first muzzled their dogs to prevent an alarm. The Indians were ten in number. They were asleep, covered with blankets. The mode of attack was in sections, of five men in each, in as quick succession as possible. Lovell and a friendly Indian were in the first section, and before a gun was fired, this Indian removed a blanket with the muzzle of his gun, in order to find which way their heads lay, and make their immediate death more sure. Seven were killed as they lay, and two more as they attempted to rise. The tenth fled to a pond 6 near by, where he was overtaken by the dogs, which were let loose, and held fast till killed. They were all then scalped and their bodies thrown through a hole cut in the ice, into the pond. These Indians were found to be well supplied with new guns, ammunition, and a number of 6 This pond is situated in Wakefield, N.

If this supposition were true, it would seem to afford some justification for Lovell and his men in the manner of their slaughter. With the scalps of these ten Indians, stretched on hoops and elevated on poles, this daring company made a tri umphal entry into the town of Dover, New Hampshire, and thence proceeded to Boston, where they received the bounty of four hundred pounds sterling, equal to seven teen hundred and seventy-seven dollars. Flushed with the success of these two expeditions, especially the last related, Lovell determined on a third, intending to proceed to the villages of Pequawket, on the head waters of Saco river, which were the occasional res idence of Indians. He accordingly marched with his company, consisting of forty-six men, officers, surgeon and chaplain included, in April, 1725. They had not pro ceeded far, when two soldiers, becoming lame, returned. Having arrived at the head of Great Ossipee Pond, another man falling sick, they made a halt and built a fort, wherein they left the sick man, the surgeon, and a part of their provisions, with a guard of eight men. The com pany, thus reduced to thirty-four, proceeded towards Pequawket, till they came within a few miles of the vil lages. They here heard, or fancied they heard, Indians about their camp in the night, and had good reason to suppose they were more numerous than themselves. In these circumstances, Lovell consulted his men, and offered, if they would request it, to lead them back, without seeing the object of their expedition. They answered, \" We will not return and be called cowards.\" Early in the morning of the memorable eighth of May, while the company were attending prayers, the report of"], [127, "103 THE FIGHT. a gun was heard, and an Indian discovered on a point of land on the opposite side of an adjacent pond. Supposing this Indian might be a decoy 7 to lead them into an ambush, Lovell ordered his men to lay down their packs, that they might be ready for action on any emergency. Taking a circuit round the pond they met the Indian, fired at, but missed him. He returned the fire from two fowling pieces, and wounded Lovell himself and one of his men with small shot. Ensign Wyman fired, and killed him. Having taken his scalp, they returned to the spot where they had deposited their packs. During their absence, Paugus, the far-famed chief of Pequawket, with his warriors, whose numbers are said by some to have been forty-one, others say eighty, and some thought there were more, had found their packs, and finding by their number that Lovell's force was less than his, he removed them and lay in ambush. When Lovell and his men had arrived at the spot and were looking about for their packs, the ambush suddenly rose and rushed upon them, with their accustomed hideous yells. Lovell ordered his men to fire and reload with swan shot, as the enemy were within a few guns' length of them. Lovell was killed by the first shot of the enemy, and eight of his men soon shared the same fate. Lieut. Farwell, and two others, were wounded. Ensign Wyman assumed the command, and, perceiving that the Indians were endeavoring to sur round them, ordered a retreat to the pond ; where, with a ledge of rocks projecting into the water on the one hand, and a brook, not fordable, on the other, they took their stand, placing themselves behind trees, for a protection against the bullets of the enemy. During the day the Indians endeavored in vain to persuade or compel them to surrender themselves prisoners. To this they would 7 From evidence afterwards obtained, it is probable that this Indian was hunting and fishing, and that his shot was at some ducks."], [128, "104 PAUGUS KILLED BY CHAMBERLAIN. not consent ; victory or death being their choice. Some time in the day, the gun of John Chamberlain of Groton becoming foul, by continued firing, he undertook to wash and cleanse it at the pond. While in the act, he spied Paugus, whom he personally knew, performing the same process upon his gun, at a small distance. A challenge was immediately given and accepted, each confiding in his own dexterity, and predicting the speedy fall of his antagonist. Chamberlain trusting to the priming of his gun by a thump on the ground, had time to take de liberate aim, while Paugus was priming from his horn. Chamberlain's ball reached Paugus's heart just as he was in the act of firing. His ball passed over Chamberlain's head. After this event, there was a short respite. The In dians withdrew. Ensign Wyman and Chamberlain crept unperceived after them, and found them formed in a circle around one in the centre, whom they were cmalifying, it was supposed, for a chief instead of the deceased Paugus. Wyman fired and killed their intended chief. Then both hastened back to their fellows at the pond. Soon after this, the Indians renewed the combat, having, as was supposed, received a reinforcement. As night approached, however, they again withdrew, and left this courageous but forlorn little band to consider their melancholy situation, and deliberate upon what measures they should pursue, to save their lives. Upon examination, nine were found to be unhurt, eleven wounded, but not mortally, and three mortally wounded. Lieut. Robbins, whose thigh was broken, and whom it was impossible for them to carry off, requested to have his gun, (some say two guns,) loaded and left by his side, saying that if he should live till morning, when the Indians should come to scalp him, he would kill one more.

All, who were able, now 8 withdrew from this mem orable spot, and directed their course to the fort, where the guard, surgeon and provisions had been left, expect ing there to find what they so much needed, food, and dressing of their wounds. In this, however, they were sadly disappointed. They found the fort abandoned. Some provisions, however, are by some accounts said to have been left in it. The cause of this sad disappoint ment was this. At the commencement of the combat, in the morning, one of the men, whose name is not found in the roll of the company, and is intentionally and suc cessfully concealed from the present generation, made his escape, hastened to this fort, and repotted that Lovell and all his men were killed, which he had undoubtedly good reason to believe. Disappointed in the relief they here expected, and fearing the Indians might pursue and de stroy them all, they separated, and arrived at the settle ments, some sooner and some later, as their strength enabled them. Lieut. Farwell, Jonathan Frye, and Elias Barron, perished on the way. With them the journal of the expedition was lost. A party from New Hampshire were ordered to go to the place and bury the dead, but by some mistake they did not find the spot. Col. Tyng, of Dunstable, then, with a company, went out and found twelve dead bodies, buried them, and carved their names upon the trees. He also, at a little distance, found three Indian graves, which he opened, and in one of them found the body of Paugus. He also traced blood upon the ground to a great distance from the scene of action.9 8 Belknap says, \" After the rising of the moon.\" But the moon was at the first quarter, and set about 1 o'clock, A.

One of them having a fish hook, they cut strips from their moccasins for a line, and succeeded in taking the fish. Having kindled a sire, they cooked and ate of it. It refreshed Davis, but proved fatal to Mr. Frye. This fish hook and line were preserved till the centennial celebration in Fryeburg, in 1S25, when they were sent to that place for exhibition. Another anecdote from verbal testimony is, that one of the wounded men, on his return, becoming very weak and discouraged, crept into a hole in the ground, made by the blowing down of a tree, and laid himself down to die. Not long aster, he heard a noise, which he supposed the approach of an Indian ; he made a great effort and sprung from his intended death-bed, de termined to resist to the last. But, instead of an Indian, he found one of their dogs had followed his footsteps to the place ; and being rejoiced to find so good a friend for a companion, he resumed his march and came home. May 16, 1725, only eight days after the fight, Thomas Symes, V. D. M., preached a sermon at Bradford, entitled, \" The brave Lovewell and several of his company lamented.\" This sermon, with an account of the expedition, attested by three of the men, who escaped, viz., Seth Wyman, of Woburn, Ebenezer Ayer, and Abial Asten, of Haverhill, was printed, and probably contains the most correct account to be found. This account stales, that the offer of Capt. Lovell to lead home his men, was aster the firing of the gun by the Indian, and the answer of the men is stated in these words. \" We came out to meet the enemy ; we have all along prayed God that we might find them; and we had rather trust Providence with our lives, yea, die for our country, than to try to return without seeing them, if we may, and be called cowards for our pains.\" This account also states, that eleven of the men came in at Dunstable, May 13th, at night, and four more the loth. Eleazer Davis came in at Ber wick, and Josiah Davis at Saco. It further relates that Solomon Kies, hav ing received three wounds, crept to Ensign Wyman, in time of the battle, told him he was a dead man, but would try to get away, so that the Indians might not get his scalp. Finding a canoe at the pond, he rolled himself into it, and the wind carrying him several miles towards the fort, he gained strength and arrived at it. It is said, that children and relatives of Indians, who had been killed by the English, were accustomed to avenge their deaths upon those who killed them, if known. Many stories are told of single Indians, coming in times of peace, and seeking for those who slew a father or friend, and I have heard of their coming more Ulan once to avenge the death of Paugus upon Chamberlain. But no accurate and well attested statement of such a visit to Groton, by any descendant of Paugus, can, I apprehend, at this distance of"], [132, "108 YOUNG PAUGUS AND CHAMBERLAIN.

The following tale, from the Atlantic Souvenir, is founded upon one of those visits, and after making due allowances for embel lishments, anacronisms, and false localities, may be substantially true. It certainly does not differ more from stories still related here, than novelists' accounts usually do from realities. \" The old French war was over. The banners of England had long streamed above the towers of Quebec. The Indians had lest the lakes and woods of New Hampshire, for the broader waters, and deeper forests, of Canada and the west. Time had tamed the iron sinews of the rangers, untamable by any other enemy, or they were sleeping \" each in his narrow cell forever laid.\" Where the red man once roamed after the moose, prowled upon the scout, or lighted the council fire, now stood the infant village, and the peaceful neighborhood. The water-fall, at whose roaring foot the Indian once darted his rude spear into the salmon, or hooked the trout upon his curved bit of bone, now turned the wheel of the clumsy grist mill, whither the jogging farmer brought his \"rye and Indian,\" over moss and hill, and through bush and swamp, in safety. The congregations, as they gathered together \" at meeting,\" no longer brought their charged guns to the house of worship, or feared that the prayers of their minister would be in terrupted by the war-whoop. Of Lovell's men, scarcely a survivor remained of the few that lived through the desperate fight, at Pequawket. Cham berlain was still alive. He was an old grey-headed man. He had long given over hunting, and peace had changed his war spear into an imple ment of husbandry ; of all his hunting and fighting years, nothing remained to him but the gun that killed Paugus at Lovell's pond, and the bullet pouch and yellow powder horn, covered over with Indian devices, which were the spoil of the savage in that terrible encounter. These he had pre served with an old man's care. His cottage, from which went up the soli tary smoke that caught the eye of Lovell and his men, now was the centre of a considerable hamlet. A wild stream ran past it, and a little way below it, tumbled down a fall, upon which stood one of the rude saw-mills of that day, and old Chamberlain, once the swift hunter, and the strong and proud warrior, was now its humble owner, and more humble tender. He had survived his wife and his children. Few of his neighbors ventured to be familiar with him, on account of the stern peculiarity of his character; and he passed his days in solitude, except such association as men had with him in his humble vocation. In the year 1777,* towards the close of one of those fair days in autumn, which make up the \" Indian summer,\" a number of the villagers of P , had gathered into their one-story tavern, to talk over their little politics, as they were wont, when they were surprised and startled by the entrance of * lt could not have been so late, by many years."], [133, "109 YOUNG PAUGUS AND CHAMBERLAIN. tended further northward and westward ; Groton was no longer a frontier town, and it is not supposed to have suf- a young Indian among them. An Indian, at that time, had got to be a rarity in P He was tall, over six feet, and finely formed, aster the fashion of the forest. He had a belt of wampum around his waist, and from it hung his tomahawk. A long gun was in his hand, and he stood in moccasins, with the grace and dignity of the son of a chief. He placed his gun behind the door, and silently took his seat by himself. A little before sunset the farmers left the inn and returned to their homes. One old hunter remained with the landlord and the young savage. The hunter eyed the Indian with keen attention, \u2014 his suspicions were awakened at the sight of this warrior, armed, so remote from the residence of the nearest tribe, and in a time of peace. He was acquainted with the Indians in the old wars, and his sus picions were heightened and confirmed, when he heard the young chief ask the landlord, in a low and indifferent tone, if ' one Chamberlain dwelt in the village.' The landlord pointed out to him the mill, where the old man labored, and the cottage where he dwelt. The Indian took his gun and went out. \"' Some of theblood of old Paugus,' said the hunter, 'and, I'll venture my Use, come to avenge the death of that chief upon Chamberlain. I'll give the old man warning.' He hastily stepped out, and following a winding path, that led down to the saw-mill, where the old man was still at his toils, he reached the mill, and told Chamberlain, that young Paugus, from Canada, had come with his rifle and tomahawk to avenge upon him the death o/that chief. Chamberlain's cheek turned ashy pale, and he sternly replied, ' tell young Paugus I have the gun that slew his father, and he had far better return to his forest than molest me in my old age ; ' as he spoke, he pointed to the long gun as it hung upon prongs of the moose horn, driver* into the saw-mill plate, and near it was suspended the bullet-pouch and pow der-horn of Pequawket. The hunter had given his warning and retired. The sun was setting to the south of Moosehillock. Chamberlain took dowo his gun, \u2014 tried his flint, \u2014 charged it, \u2014 took the pouch and horn and flung them upon his side, \u2014 hung up near the saw-gate the old garment he had worn at work through the day, \u2014 hoisted the gate of the mill and set it rapidly agoin\"-, looked keenly around him, in every direction, and retired to an eminence a few rods distant, crowned with a clump of thick bushes, and crouched down to await the approach of his mysterious enemy. He was not, however, mysterious to Chamberlain. The old man remembered every trait in the Indian character, and calculated with great accuracy as to the time and manner of Paugus's advance. Just as it was growing too dusky to distinguish a human form, except towards the west, the old man descried him creeping cautiously from a bunch of bushes, eight or ten rods above the mill, by the torrent, with his cocked rifle before him, and his hand upon the lock. The young savage heard the noise of the saw-frame, and could discern it in rapid motion, and shrunk back into the thicket. He came out again, a?"], [134, "110 YOUNG PAUGUS'S DEATH. fered to any considerable extent, during this war. One man, however, by the name of Jacob Ames, is said to have been killed, about this time, in the following manner. An Indian had been seen, for several days, lurking about the town, it was conjectured, upon some ill design. little distance from where he went in, and, with the wary motions of the ambush, reconnoitered the mill. Chamberlain marked him all the while, as the catamount eyes the fox. Young Paugus came out of the bushes the third time, and in a new quarter, and was stealthily advancing, when something seemed to catch his eye in the form of his father's slayer \u2014 he stopped short \u2014 brought his rifle to his eye, and, with quick aim, fired. The report rung sharp and low upon the still air, as if the gun itself were muffled, or afraid to speak above its breath. Young Paugus crept out upon a mill log, that extended over the rapid, and stretching himself up to his full height, as if to ascertain, without advancing, the success of his shot. The old man could spare him no longer. He saw the well-remembered form of the old Pequawket chief, as the young savage stood against the \u00abky of the west, which was still red with the rays of the sunken sun. He levelled the fatal gun \u2014 it blazed \u2014 young Paugus leaped into the air six feet, as the ball whistled through his heart \u2014 and his lifeless body fell far down into the rapid, that foamed below him, while his vengeful spirit fled and mingled with that sterner one, which parted long before at Lovewell's pond, in ' The land where their fathers had gone.' Chamberlain returned slowly and gloomily to his cottage. \" The next morning a bullet hole through the centre of the old garment he had hung at the saw-frame, admonished him, that the aim, as well as the vengeance of old Paugus, had descended to his sons; and as he mused upon those he had slain, and reflected, that although he was old, he still might have again to list his gun against the blood of Paugus, or himself fall by their avenging hand, he wished bitterly, that some other bullet than his own had slain that renowned chief, and that they had never met to quench their battle thirst, and scour out their foul guns, upon the shore of Lovewell's pond.\"* * The pond in Wakefield, N. H., whore the ten Indians were killed, in Lovewell's second expedition, bears this name, and not the one in Fryeburg, Me., where the battle was fought. When, or where, Chamberlain died, 1 have not been able to ascertain ; but he was probably dead before 1777. He had two children, born in Groton before the fight ; the first, in 1713. If ever young Paugus sought to avengo his father's death, and it seems pretty evident, from tradition, that he did, it was probably at Groton, where the traditions place it, and the old dam, near school house No. 9, is Baid to have been the dam of Chamberlain's mill ; and, further, a deep hole in the brook, between the lands of Deacon Thomas Hutchins and Merick Lewis, is called \" Paugus's hole,\" wherein it is said, Chamberlain sunk his body, after be had killed him."], [135, "JACOB AMES KILLED. 111 Mr. Ames, who lived on the intervale, on the west side of Nashua river, now owned by John Boynton, Esq., went into his pasture to catch his horse. Discovering the Indian, he ran for his house ; the Indian pursued and shot him as he entered his gate. The dead body pre vented the gate's closing, as it would otherwise have done of itself, and the Indian pressed in to enter the house, where Ames had a son and daughter. The son seized his gun, and shot at him, as he entered the gate. The ball, striking the latch of the door, split, and one part of it wounded the Indian, but not severely. As the son at tempted to close the door against the enemy, after the shot, the Indian thrust his foot in, and prevented. The son called to his sister to bring his father's gun from the bedside, and at the same time striking the Indian's foot with the breach of his gun, compelled him to with draw it, and closed the door. While the Indian was in the act of reloading his gun, the young man found means to shoot through a crevice and killed him. Two men, at work about a mile distant in a mill, Ezra and Benjamin Farnsworth, hearing the reports of the guns, and suspect ing the cause thereof, were soon at the place, and found the bodies of Ames and the Indian both weltering in their blood. This is the last man killed by an Indian within the bounds of Groton. The subject of this chapter affords abundant matter for contemplation and reflection. A race of human beings, ignorant and miserable, less than three centuries ago, numerous, but wholly destitute of the knowledge and skill to employ air, water, fire, and mechanics, advantageously, roamed over these lands al most wholly uncultivated. Now view the contrast. Where the red man, with bow, arrows and tomahawk, pursued his game through wastes, wilds and woods, now cultivated fields, orchards and gardens, with rich pro-"], [136, "112 CIRCUMSTANCES CONTRASTED. ducts, abound. The waters, from which he with rude spears, pots and weirs drew his daily food, and of which he made no use save to swim his frail canoe, now move millions of wheels, spindles and looms, to fabricate the necessaries, conveniences and luxuries of civilized life. Where once stood the uncouth wigwams of the wild-man, now arise richly garnished houses, in villages, towns and cities. But we cannot forbear to inquire, had our Puritan forefathers the same right to dispossess the aborigines of this country, and utterly annihilate the race, that the Israelites had to drive out the inhabitants of Canaan, and take possession of the promised land ? They seem so to have believed, and so to have conducted. And more completely have the Massachusetts, the Narragansetts, the Pequots, the Pawtuckets, and Wampanoags been extir minated, than were the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, the Hittites, and the Jebusites of old. How different, also, are our anxieties and cares, our pleasures and pains, our labors and amusements, from those of our predecessors, during the periods of Indian wars ! We can pursue our customary employments in our fields, workshops, or factory mills, in security ; they must have an armed guard, when abroad, and weapons by their firesides and bedsides at home. We, in our well lighted and well warmed parlors, can cheerfully and happi ly spend our long winter evenings with friends, wives, and children, in the improvement of our minds, or in innocent amusements. They, in their rude and cold cabins, must sit silent and gloomy, in dark corners, fearing to light up and warm their apartments, lest the savages should spy them through the cracks and crevices.

It now came to the test, whether the patriotic votes and resolves, heretofore so unanimously passed, would be followed up in meeting the disciplined forces of Great Britain, well armed and equipped, by cultivators of the ground, with such fowling pieces and muskets as they happened to hold. The decision was in the affirmative. Two companies of minute men, with officers complete, numbering in all one hundred and one men, marched on the ever memorable 19th of April, 1775, too late to take a part in the actions of that day, but to be at head quarters in readiness for future operations.

Independ ence had been achieved, but unless a form of government could be devised and adopted, which would unite the several colonies in one national compact, independence might have proved a curse, rather than a blessing to those who had obtained it. The condition of the people was unfavorable for uniting upon any constitution, which should be proposed for their future government, so diverse were their several interests and opinions on political subjects. Most of the colonies had formed State constitutions, for their own particular government, and they were each disinclined to give up the powers necessary to form a Federal union. The soldiers, having left the camp and mingled with the peo ple, had an unfavorable influence upon the industry, economy and morality of the people ; the enormous debts, both public and private, contracted through the severe struggle of a seven years' war, and the almost total want of a currency, wherewith to negotiate and discharge debts, were circumstances which might well fill all hearts with dismay. It is said the merchants, at this period, made large and unwarrantable importations of foreign merchan dize, and not having an equivalent to export, the little specie they had in circulation was drained from the country, and increased the distresses, which were before almost insupportable. Burdens and grievances, whether real or imaginary, are increased by sympathy ; and the people, collecting in smaller or larger assemblies, commu nicating with each other upon them, greatly enhance their own miseries. The people of Massachusetts had adopted a constitu tion, formed by her ablest, wisest and most patriotic statesmen ; a constitution which has now stood three fourths of a century without any material alterations, in none with its fundamental principles, and under which its"], [152, "128 INSURRECTIONARY MOVEMENTS. citizens have enjoyed a state of almost uninterrupted hap piness, and arrived at a state of unexampled prosperity. Yet the people, in less than six years after they had adopted it, became dissatisfied with it, commenced an insurrection, proceeded to open rebellion, and, but for the energy, patriotism and courage of those intrusted with the administration of the government, and a majority of the people, this constitution, which had not then been tried long enough to prove its excellency, might have been destroyed, and that at a time, when the patriots of all the colonies were devising a form of general government for all the colonies. Had so important a State as Massachu setts, at that crisis, fallen into a state of anarchy, the present existing Union would probably have been wholly prevented, or at least for a long time delayed. Had the insurrectionists of Massachusetts succeeded in their schemes, and had their principles extended into the other States, of which at one time there seemed to be great danger, what would now have been the condition of our commerce, agriculture, manufactures, steamboats and rail roads, and all the arts of civilized life ? But our limits will not admit of expatiating further upon this rebellion, except so far as Groton was particularly engaged in it. Unfortunately there were a majority of the legal voters and taxpayers in the town, who took part in resisting the due administration of government, when the inhabitants of various towns in this and other counties, in the Com monwealth, were assembling in smaller and larger con ventions, deploring the condition of the country, and making out catalogues of their grievances, as they termed them, the malcontents of Groton petitioned the selectmen of the town, to call a meeting of the inhabitants immedi ately, and dictated the subjects to be acted upon at the meeting.

This document plainly shows how utterly incapable a majority of the people were of judging rightly of the causes of their sufferings, and of the best remedies for re- lief; how crude and impracticable their notions were on financial affiairs, and due how could they be othe administration of justice. And otherwise ? Those, who had spent their time in the army, had not been in a school to"], [156, "132 INJUDICIOUS MEASURES. learn the duties of jurists and statesmen ; and those, who had been on their farms, and in their shops, had no better opportunity to become wise legislators. The issues from the press had taught, that sovereignty belonged to the people, and that it was their right to exercise it ; but they had not taught them how to use it for their greatest benefit and happiness. The inflammatory writings of the time, roused the people to resist sovereign power ; but having framed and adopted a constitution of their own, and chosen officers to administer it, and make laws in conformity to it, they did not reflect or consider that the sovereignty was thereby delegated, and that they had no right to resume it in a summary manner. They rather considered the rulers as their servants, whose services and directions they might accept or reject at pleasure ; and that the constitution and laws might be annulled and set aside, whenever they should deem it expedient. Thus ignorant of the true causes of their distress, and attribut ing to government what the previous war and their pres ent indolent habits and extravagant notions of liberty had unavoidably brought upon them, they probably proceeded conscientiously in resisting the laws, and opposing their due execution, unapprehensive of the disastrous conse quences, which would follow, if their resistance and revolutionary measures should be successful. They made no discrimination between resisting the government which they had chosen for themselves, and which by peaceable means they could change, and the one in which they had no choice. What a striking contrast between the language of these rebels, and that of the patriots at the commencement of the Revolutionary war ! The first act of violence, committed by the insurgents, was forcibly preventing the courts of justice from hold ing their sessions, and transacting their regular business. Job Shattuck, of Groton, who had been a soldier in the French war, and a commissioned officer in the Revolu-"], [157, "133 COURTS AT CONCORD PREVENTED. tionary war, and who was otherwise qualified to be con spicuous in such a cause, became the leader and com mander of the insurgent forces, in Middlesex county. The historian, who wrote an account of this rebellion, the next year after it happened, and who had ample means of knowing the facts in relation to the transactions at Concord, when the court of common pleas and gene ral sessions of the peace were there by law to be holden, says, \" No sooner was it known by the insurgents, who were contemptible in point of strength and character, that government would not act with force, than they appeared in triumph on the spot.\" \" They took possession of the court house, and paraded with great insolence before the court who had assembled at a small distance. One of their leaders 2 was exceedingly outrageous, and once threatened to put all persons to the sword, who would not join them in two hours. Such was the profanity of his language, that it at first staggered the less hardened party from Wor cester, but a union of forces afterwards took place. Job Shattuck, their principal leader, sent a written message, that it was the sense of the people that the court should not sit. He afterwards affected to permit the court of sessions to sit, on condition of adjourning to a day pre scribed ; but the issue was, that the rioters grew still more outrageous, and no court could sit at all.\" When the court was about to be holden at Cambridge, the Gov ernor issued orders for the militia of Middlesex to be in readiness to march to that place. \" But,\" says the histo rian, \" an influential character in Middlesex undertook to make an agreement with the leaders of that county, that no forces should appear on either side, and wrote a letter to the Governor on this subject to their satisfaction.\" But the insurgents did not abide by their agreement ; and they took measures to have a large and imposing force 1 Capt. Nathan Smith of Shirley."], [158, "134 PARKER AND PAGE ARRESTED. collected from Worcester and Bristol counties, to join those of Middlesex, at Cambridge. The historian proceeds : \" Pursuant to this new scheme, a small party of Middlesex insurgents, headed by Oliver Parker, [of Groton,] (Job Shattuck, their former captain, coming in a more secret manner, in order to avoid the appearance of breaking his agreement,) marched into the town of Concord. Upon their arrival, Shattuck pro ceeded in the night to Weston, to get intelligence of the Worcester forces, but though they had begun their march, they did not appear, and from this want of co-operation the whole plan fell through. \" The leaders of the insurrectionists, having thus re jected the pardon which was held up to them by the General Court,\" \u2014 \" warrants were issued for apprehending the head men of the insurgents, in Middlesex, and for imprisoning them without bail or mainprise. The execu tion of these warrants was committed to the sheriff of Middlesex and others, to whose aid a party of horse, who had voluntarily associated for the support of government, under Colonel Benjamin Hitchborn, was ordered from Boston, early in the morning of the 29th of November. These were joined by a party from Groton, under the command of Col. Henry Woods, and the whole, consist ing of more than one hundred, proceeded immediately for Concord. On their arrival there, the Groton horse, as being best acquainted with the country, and least liable to excite an alarm from an unfamiliar appearance to the inhabitants, were dispatched to secure the subjects of the warrant. These returned at night with two prisoners, Oliver Parker and Benjamin Page ; but Shattuck, the principal leader, had taken an alarm and escaped. Under this disappointment, at midnight, in the midst of a violent snow-storm, the whole party were ordered on to Shat tuck's house, in Groton, where they did not arrive till late in the morning.

Shattuck obsti nately resisted, and was not taken till he had received several wounds, and which he returned without much injury.\" Thus three of the leaders of the rebels being secured, the adherents to the party in Groton, it is believed, did no more treasonable acts, but soon after went before a magis trate, delivered up their arms, took the oath of allegiance, and became peaceable subjects of government. No less than seventy names of persons belonging to Groton, are found, who did so. It is not necessary, in relating the affairs of a single country township, to follow the narra tive of the Shays rebellion farther ; though it might teach the present and future generations a salutary lesson, to avoid treasonable resistance of government, and to aid in a firm support of law and order. The issue is well known. The strong arm of government, energetically and judiciously exercised, in a few months overcame all opposition, with very little bloodshed to either of the belligerents ; and the penitence of the prisoners, though convicted of the highest in the catalogue of crimes, pro cured them a pardon from the executive. There are those of the present day, who do not duly distinguish between that liberty which is consistent with good government, and liberty degenerated to licentious ness, who would probably have joined the insurgents, had they lived at that time, and who now half justify their proceedings, or at least go so far as to say, that much good accrued to the Commonwealth by them. True it is, that from every evil some good may arise ; but men are not to be envied, whose achievements are good, only that they may be set up as a beacon to warn others against falling into the same follies, errors and wickedness.

It is matter of much doubt, on what spot this first built church stood. Tradition says it stood near the crossing of the road leading from school-house No. 5, and the Nod road, so called. And in corroboration of this tra dition, it is said, that an aged white oak near this spot was 1 Imprimis. 2 Item. 3 Uncertain what quantity. 4 This is the footing of the account. Probably some error in the copy."], [164, "140 SITE OF FIRST MEETING-HOUSE. felled a sew years since, which had many nails, spikes and hooks in its trunk, denoting that it had been a pillar for fastening horses. But no good reason can now be assigned, why it should have been situated so far to the north. The principal men, both in note and number, were certainly not in that part of the town. It is well known, that James Parker, John Nutting, Thomas Tar bell, William Green, James Fiske, and what is stronger evidence, the Rev. Mr. Willard, whose house had been the place of public worship for three or four years, were all seated along the site of the present principal village. Here were their garrisoned houses, four of them at least, and the fifth nearly a mile off. The frame, we have seen, was removed from the spot where it was first voted it should stand. But the precise spots where once stood the \" small white oak, with two notches and a blaze,\" or the \" corner of Joseph Parker's fence,\" will, I apprehend, be never again known. This meeting-house was burnt by the Indians in 1676, as has been related in a former chapter. Soon after the resettlement of the town, in the spring of 1678, the subject of building a new meeting-house was agitated, and, as appears by the following votes, caused like strifes and contentions to those on similar occasions in later times. \" At a town meeting in Groton, it was agreed for the year ensuing, provided that the town do build a meeting house, upon fifty pounds for this year.\" This vote passed December 11, probably in 1679, and the fifty pounds were probably the whole assessment for town charges. \" At a general town meeting held June 8, 1680.

It stood at the northeast corner of what is now called the old common, a few rods northerly of school-house No. 14. Within forty years last past, the lines upon which the underpinning lay were distinctly visible, so that the length and breadth of the building could have been accu rately measured. But the soil has since been removed, so that no trace remains. Among the assessments made in 1680, are the fol lowing. \"A rate made for the meeting-house frame, the just \u00a332 19 8. sum is \" A rate made by the selectmen, for covering the meeting-house, roof and sides, windows, doors, stairs and pulpit, and the just sum is \u00a344 2 5.\" At a town meeting, November 14, 1681, the town voted to raise money to finish the meeting-house by a sale of common lands ; and chose Capt. Parker, Lieut. Lakin and Sarg. Knap, a committee to make the sales. By an account of the sales recorded in the town book, it appears that Capt. Parker purchased a quantity not stated for \u00a311 10s. Od. Joseph Parker, three hundred acres for \u00a315 00s. Od. Sarg.

The building of a third house for worship began to be in contemplation in the beginning of the year 1714. In January, the town voted, \" that they will build a new meeting-house in some convenient time.\" February 1, they voted to build a meeting-house fifty feet long, and forty feet wide, and that the place for its standing should be determined at March meeting, by the voters, bringing in written votes, with their names on the vote. At March meeting it was determined, that the meeting-house should stand \"at Green's,\" (the site of the present church of the first parish) ; seventy men bringing in their votes for that place, which must have been nearly or quite unani mous. The other place proposed, was where the second house stood. It is not stated how many voted for that place. The size was altered by vote to forty by thirty five feet, and it was also voted that the town should \" be at no charge concerning a bridge over Broad meadow.\" Probably the people who lived in the westerly part of the town would have been better accommodated by having the house at the site of the old one, than at \" Green's,\" and those in favor of the latter place engaged to accommodate them with the road across Broad meadow, at their individual expense. Several votes passed this, and the two succeeding years, for raising money, and finishing the meeting-house, by which it appears that it was not completed immediately. This meeting-house was set upon the land of Mr. John Ames, who, on the eighteenth day of January, 1716-17, in consideration of a certain pew in the meeting-house, voted or granted to him at a town meeting holden Novem ber 5, 1716, and \" that there be no farther trouble or con troversy within the said town referring to the land on"], [168, "144 HOUSE ENLARGED AND SEATED. which the meeting-house now stands, and other good considerations, bargained, sold, and conveyed to said town of Groton, a certain parcel of land, formerly belonging to Mr. Willard, containing about ninety-five poles, bounded southerly and southwesterly by highways, and otherwise by said Ames's land, (no length of lines being given,) the new meeting-house standing on the same.\" It appears, that in ten or eleven years after the erection of this house, the population of the town had so increased, that the meeting-house was not of sufficient capacity to accommodate them. They, therefore, in March, 1727-8, voted to enlarge, or make an addition to it, chose a com mittee to consult workmen, and proceed to make the addition, and at the same time granted eighty pounds for the purpose, and in the course of the next year, eighty pounds more.

William Martin, of Groton, by his last will and testa ment, dated March 6, 1672, bequeathed to said town, the sum of ten pounds, \" towards purchasing a meeting-house bell for the town's use.\" On the 27th day of October, 1729, the town chose Samuel Tarbell and Benjamin Prescott, E\u00a7q., \" a committee fully empowered to inquire after, demand and receive, and if need be, sue for the money given the town by William Martin's last will and testament.\" Mr. Martin died March 26, 1672. His will had been duly approved, and his executor had also died. The above committee, under the authority of the town, sued Benjamin Lakin, one of the devisees or legatees of Martin, who had received his portion of the estate, as executor de bonis non, in his own wrong. This writ issued November 26, 1731, almost sixty years after the decease of the testator, and they recovered the legacy. August 25, 1732, the town voted, \" That Benjamin Prescott, Nathaniel Sawtell and Lieut. William Lawrence, be a committee to provide the town with a bell for the meeting-house, to the value of one hundred and ten pounds, and to draw the money for that use, that was given by William Martin and Jonathan Lawrence, de ceased. Jonathan Lawrence's will was dated August 27, 1725, and it was approved October 29, 1729 ; one hun dred pounds were bequeathed to the town in and by said will, \" towards the purchasing and procuring a good meet ing-house bell, and the putting it up.\" May 14, 1752, the town \" voted, that the selectmen take down the meeting-house bell forthwith, and that it be sent to Great Britain to be new run, and to know the present value ihereof ; and that William Lawrence, Esq., be desired to undertake to get a new bell, the weight thereof to be five hundred pounds, and that the name of 19"], [170, "146 COMMON ENLARGED. Lieut. Jonathan Lawrence be set thereon.\" In December following, the town voted, \" that the new bell be hung when it comes up,\" and a committee was then chosen to report how it should be hung, who reported at the same time, that it be \" hung in a place built for that purpose fifteen feet high and twelve feet broad.\" But it is not probable that it was so hung, inasmuch as the town at the same meeting voted to build a new meeting-house, and immediately after proceeded in the business. At the time of making the addition to the meeting house, as above related, the town, in order to enlarge the common, exchanged some lands with the Rev. Mr. Trow bridge, who then owned the land formerly owned by John Ames, adjoining the common, and on the west side of the highway, now owned by Jonathan Loring. The lane from the great road down to Broadmeadow was four rods wide, between the lands of Mr. Trowbridge on the north, and Eleazer Green on the south. The town un dertook to convey two rods in width of the north side of this lane, being about sixty-four square rods, to Mr. Trowbridge, for the same quantity on the north and east sides of the common, as bought of John Ames. This addition to the common was in the shape of a carpenter's square, the longest and widest part being on the north side. The highway lately laid out on the northerly side of the meeting-house, takes a part of this land, and the parish have since purchased the triangular piece easterly of the meeting-house. The third meeting-house, built as we have seen in 1714, '15 and '16, with the addition thereto made in 1730, answered the purpose for a place of public worship, without any movement for repairs or building a new one, till about the year 1745. Pepperell having been made a precinct, and built a meeting-house, parochial affairs were transacted by the inhabitants as the first parish ; but the town clerk being clerk also of the parish, and the"], [171, "VOTES TO REPAIR AND TO BUILD. 147 records being kept promiscuously in the same book, it is difficult in some cases to distinguish them.

After the site and size of this house had been deter mined, and the raising had been accomplished, and the outside perhaps finished, there were still important ques tions to be settled, which held the inhabitants in a state of great inquietude and excitement. How many pews shall be built ? who shall build them ? the parish, or those who shall own them? what shall be their shape and dimensions? where shall they be situated ? shall there be any in the gallery ? These were subjects which for a considerable time agitated the town, and on which various and sometimes contrary decisions were made. At a town meeting held December 2, 1754, it was"], [173, "149 QUESTIONS CONCERNING PEWS. voted to have pews in the meeting-house. Also, that a committee of fifteen persons be appointed to measure and make plans of the lower floor and the gallery, in reference to pew ground, and to report at the adjourned meeting.

A motion for the town to build the pews, negatived ; a motion to sell the pew ground for three thousand five hundred pounds, negatived. The meeting was then adjourned to December 23d. At this second adjournment, the town first voted to reconsider all votes passed at the first adjournment. The several motions were then again made, and the questions put, and decided very nearly in the same manner as be fore. The final determination was, that there should be a tier of pews all round the meeting-house by the walls, and a second tier on the floor, except at the ends of the seats ; and that there should be pews in the front gallery, and whether any more, left to the discretion of the finish ing committee ; and the town were to build the whole number.

It is said that on this occasion the ridiculous notion, that a fire kindled by lightning could not be extinguished by water, but could be by milk, induced some persons to carry milk from the neighboring dairy rooms for the pur pose of preserving the meeting-house. This building, after having been several times repaired, and the inside altered, by removing seats and making pews in their stead, till the whole ground floor and most of the gallery was occupied by pews, remained substan tially the same in outward appearance till 1839, when it was turned, the north end to the west and made the front,"], [176, "152 PRESBYTERIAN MEETING-HOUSE. the inside all taken out, and the whole thoroughly re modelled in conformity to more modern structures, and it now remains the place of worship for the inhabitants of the first parish and first church. A number of the church and people of Groton opposed the settlement of the Rev. Mr. Chaplin, as their minister and pastor, because they did not consider his doctrines and teachings purely Calvinistic. After his ordination, therefore, they absented themselves from regular attend ance on public worship and Christian ordinances. What took place in the church thereupon will be related in an other chapter. These disaffected persons built a house for public worship, placed at the forks of the roads, the one leading to Dunstable, the other to Hollis, New Hamp shire, about one mile north of the first parish meeting house, where Dea. J. Cragin's house now stands. It was boarded and shingled, and rough seats were placed in it. Occasional preaching and other Christian ordi nances were dispensed therein for a few years only. As there were not then legal facilities for escaping taxation to the regular support of religious worship, that exist at this time, to effect this it was necessary for the seceders to form a society of a different denomination from Con gregational, so they petitioned the Legislature for an act of incorporation as a Presbyterian society. To this the town assented October 27, 1788, and the act passed the 19th day of November following. The society, however, remained regularly organized but for a few years. The act of the Legislature of Massachusetts, passed in the year 1811, commonly called the Religious Freedom Bill, well suited the spirit of the times, and tended greatly to the division of towns and parishes, the multiplication of sects and religious societies, and the erection of numerous churches and chapels. The town of Groton, however,"], [177, "153 UNION MEETING-HOUSE. was not seriously affected by these general disturbances so long as the venerable Dr. Chaplin continued able to perform the duties of minister and pastor. But when the infirmities of age prevented his discharging the pastoral duties, the usual distractions, strifes and contentions, with all the bitterness of party warfare, commenced, aud ceased not till the minority finally seceded and left the majority quietly to enjoy their legal and religious rights and privi leges. The seceders commenced the erection of a meet ing-house, decent for size and accommodations, in the summer of 1826. The corner-stone was laid July 4th, of that year, and the dedication was performed January 3, 1S27. This house, called the \" Union meeting-house,\" stands in a central position in the village, and this season, [1S46,] it has undergone thorough repairs, and has been much improved in outward appearance, and conveniencies within. There have been a few of the Baptist denomination in the town for a number of years, but their numbers and abilities were not sufficient to enable them to build a house for worship, and support regular religious ordi nances, till within a few years past. In the year 1841, they erected a small, but decent and commodious, meet ing-house, at an expense of above $3,000, at the northerly part of the principal village, on the spot where the Rev. Mr. Hobart's dwelling-house stood, which was a garri soned house in 1694. This house was dedicated Feb ruary 2, 1842. Another association, with the denomination of Christ ians, erected a building near the Union meeting-house, which was for some lime occupied for religious and other purposes ; but in 1845, it was removed to a more central position, the lower part fitted for shops, and the upper made into a convenient place for concerts, lyceums, lec tures and other assemblages of the inhabitants, and is de nominated \" Liberty Hall.\" 20"], [178, "CHAPTER IX Ministers, churches and congregations \u2014 Rev.

The emigrants, who first settled upon our then inhospitable shores, brought with them their religious teachers, and one of their first employments was the organization of churches. And when the Legislature of Massachusetts made grants of lands for towns and plantations, the consideration was usually stated to be the establishment of a church ; and sometimes the grant was limited by a condition, that a sufficient number of families for carrying on church affairs should settle upon the lands granted, within a stated time. As a natural consequence of these consid erations and conditions, the first settlers of a new town or plantation invariably either took with them their minis ters, or procured one immediately after settlements were made. The first inhabitants of Groton took with them, or were immediately followed by Rev. John Miller as their minister. The first vote now to be found on record in Groton town books, and it is supposed to have passed at the first"], [179, "REV. MR. MILLER. 155 town meeting, the proceedings of which were recorded, is this. \"At a general town meeting, June 23, 1662, it was agreed upon, that the house for the minister should be set upon the place where it is now framing.\" The second vote related to the site of their intended meeting-house. \"At a general town meeting, March 18, 1663, it was generally agreed as followeth : \" I. Voted, That Mr. Miller is by the consent of the town, manifested by vote, to be desired, if God move his heart thereunto, to continue still with us, for our further edification.\" Richard Blood dissented from this vote. '\u25a0 2. That Mr. Miller shall have a twenty acre lot set out to him, according to the town's grant to him.\" It would seem by these votes, that it was intended Mr. Miller should be the settled minister of the town, but he was suddenly removed by death. In the first return of births and deaths, by the town clerk of Groton to the clerk of the courts, his death is thus stated : \" Mr. Jno. Miller, minister of God's holy word, died June 12, 1663.\" Mr. Miller, according to Mather, had been an ordained minister in England ; his name is among the early church members of Roxbury ; he preached some time in Rowley, as assistant to the Rev. Ezekiel Rogers, was afterwards settled at Yarmouth, and after this came to Groton. The people of Groton were not long without a minis ter. On the 21st day of some month in 1663, from the connection it appears to have been June, the following vote passed. \" That Mr. Willard, if he will accept it, shall be their minister as long as he lives, which Mr. Willard accepts, except a manifest providence of God appears to take him off.\" \"These persons following do dissent from this"], [180, "156 REV.

They must have been about a fourth part in number, and certainly some of the principal and most influential men of the town. At the same time, a vote passed granting Mr. Willard an interest in the ministerial house and lands. A little before or upon the 10th of September, 1663, a record was made, which is partly destroyed, but enough is legible to show, that some dissensions had taken place, and the inhabitants now express penitence for injuries done, and ask forgiveness of each other, and also of God. And a vote upon the tenth of September expresses, that Mr. Willard's salary shall commence on the first day of July, then past. So that Mr. Willard must have been at Groton in less than a month after Mr. Miller's death. Notwithstanding these votes, and also the circumstance that the title of deacon is given to James Parker, in the records of 1663, no church was yet organized, or gathered, according to the technical language of the times. The records of the first church in Roxbury have this memo randum. \" 1664, July 13, a church gathered at Groyton, and Mr. Willard ordained.\" This, then, is the date of the organization of the first church, and of the first ordi nation in Groton. Mr. Willard's salary was voted and allowed in each and every year. The first year, from July 1, 1663, to July 1, 1664, was forty pounds ; the next year fifty, and for several years after sixty ; then sixty-five, and finally rose to eighty pounds.1 From what can be gathered from the 1 An estimate of the value of this salary, compared with the price of the necessaries of life, may be made by the following statement of prices of articles, in which Mr. Willard was to receive a part of his salary, hi the year 1667. \" Wheat five shillings per bushel ; Indian corn three shillings per bushel ; pork three pence per pound; butter at six pence per pound.\""], [181, "CHARACTER. 157 votes of the town, respecting him during his ministry, it seems, that he and his little flock lived happily together, and that he was duly respected by the people of his charge. The Rev. Samuel Willard was son of Major Simon Willard, one of the first settlers of Concord, Mass., highly distinguished both as a civil and military character. He was born at Concord, January 31, 1640 ; received the honors of college at Cambridge, 1 659 ; was ordained at Groton, July 13, 1664; married Abigail Sherman, August 8, 1664, grand-daughter of Lord Darcy, Earl of Rivers, after whose death he married Eunice, daughter of Edward Tyng. He continued in the ministry at Groton till the town was burnt by the Indians, March 13, 1676. April 10, 1678, he was installed colleague pastor of the third church in Boston, (Old South,) and had the superinten dence of Harvard College, with the title of Vice Presi dent, from September 6, 1701, to August 14, 1707. He died September 12, 1707. It is said, he had twenty chil dren ; six by his first wife, and fourteen by the second. Mr. Willard was an author of great celebrity. His dis courses on various occasions and subjects were very numerous, and a list of his printed works comprises be teen thirty and forty volumes, chiefly pamphlets, it is presumed ; but his greatest work, entitled, \" A Body of Divinity, in two hundred and fifty Expository Lectures on the Assembly's Shorter Catechism,\" was printed in a folio volume, the first of that size printed in America. The Hon. Josiah Willard, Secretary of the province, by appointment of the King, for thirty-nine years, was his son, and the late Rev. Joseph Willard, President of Har vard College twenty-three years, was his great-grandson.

Upon the return of the inhabitants to resettle the town in the spring of 1678, Mr. Hobart accompanied them, or soon followed. The following record, being the first after the return, seems by the last sentence in it to have been made some time after the transactions it relates, from memory of the selectmen. \" The record of the lands granted to Mr. Gershom Ho bart, at a general town meeting, June 29, 1678, viz., all the common land, that lies near the place where the old meeting-house stood, Dunstable highway running through it, and the highway running into the Captain's land, where it may be judged most convenient by them, that are to lay it out. \" 2.

It does not ap pear by the records what salary he received for the first year, but at a meeting held 10th of 10th month, 1680, a salary of seventy pounds, to be paid in \"corn, Indian, wheat, rye, barley, at price current, as the courts shall state it, and in other provision as God bless us withal, and thirty cords of wood.\" At another meeting held the 22d of the same month, the salary was reduced to fifty pounds, one quarter part to be paid in money. We should apprehend, at this time, that a minister did not need such a bestowment in lands as the town then gr. nted. Mr. Hobart appears not to have lived harmoniously and happily with his parishoners. In the fore part of his ministry, the people were distracted with the question where their meeting-house should stand, and afterwards fixing Mr. Hobart's salary, which was done annually, caused much dissension and strife. The following copies, from the records of the town, will giue some idea of the mutual feelings between pastor and flock. The subject of building the meeting-house has been treated of in the last chapter. \" Instructions to the selectmen, December 11, 1682. \" That the selectmen do make and maintain peace and love with one another in the town, especially with Mr. Hobart, in encouraging him in his work by forwarding one another in being willing to allow him honorable maintenance, as the law directs ; and that they warn the inhabitants together till they be agreed with him, and make no pact till the town be agreed with him.\" \" At a general town meeting upon the 12th 10 m., 1682, it was agreed upon and voted by the town, that"], [184, "160 CONDITIONS OF PAYMENT. they would give Mr. Hobart three score pounds, for this year's salary, in pay and specie as followeth, that is to say, fifteen pounds in money, and five-and-forty pounds in corn and provision ; one half to be paid by the first of March, and the other half by the next Michaelmas, and six-and-thirty cords of wood.\" Whereupon, ten persons, apparently principal men of the town, engaged to pay their proportion of a seventy pound rate, a quarter part in money, and forty cords of wood. Upon this, the town voted sixty-five pounds and forty cords of wood. The salary was the same the next succeeding year, and seventy pounds the next after. \" At a general town meeting legally warned, December 14, 1685, the inhabitants of the town being generally assembled, then determined and voted, that they would give Mr. Hobart fourscore pounds this year, and so from year to year, and so not rising any higher, annually in specie as followeth : twenty pounds in money, eight pounds in pork, at eight pence per pound, and fifty-two pounds in corn, of all sorts, as it please God to bless them, to be paid in two terms, one half to be paid by the first of March next, and the other half by the tenth of Novem ber next ; and forty cords of wood, which is to be paid yearly by the last of January next, and so annually from year to year, and not to rise any higher.\" \" Understanding the pork to be paid in the first half year's pay, I assent to the vote, as witness my hand. Gershom Hobart.\" \" The town dissented from Mr. Hobart's assignment to the vote above mentioned.\" The sentence over the signature, and the signature itself, in the original, are in the handwriting of Mr. Hobart. The disagreement upon the time that a small"], [185, "161 BREACH WITH MR. HOBART. part of the salary should be paid, seems to be too small to cause a dissension between a minister and his people ; but nothing else appears to have been in dispute. \" At a general town meeting, Groton, December 28, 1685, the inhabitants of the town being assembled, then determined and voted, that Mr. Gershom Hobart has set himself at liberty from the said town, as to any engage ment from him as their minister, as also he has freed the town from any engagement to himself, by Mr. Hobart's refusing and slighting what the said town offered him for his salary,'2 at two several town meeetings, as does appear recorded in the town book ; and that the town is yeC ready and willing to agree with him for the future, if he see cause. From this vote no man dissented.\" At the same meeting, when the last vote above passed, another vote, to give Mr. Hobart one hundred pounds from year to year, ten pounds in pork at three pence per pound, and the rest \" in such pay as shall please God to bless us withal,\" was passed, without stating at what time any part should be paid, but several of the principal men dissented. Then follows this record. \" This hundred pound vote was confirmed at a general town meeting held at Groton, 4th 11th m., 16S5-6, the second time, and Mr. Hobart's assignment to the four score pounds vote was not assented to.\" So it seems the town, rather than yield as to the time of paying the pork, increased the salary twenty-five per cent., and the selectmen were ordered to make the rate accordingly. Peace, however, was not made beUveen the parties. \" At a general town meeting, held at Groton, July 27, 1686, it was then agreed upon and voted, that they would give to Mr. Gershom Hobart fourscore pounds a year, and so on annually, as he continues the town's minister ; one 1 Seventy-five pounds had first been offered, then eighty. 21"], [186, "162 TROUBLES WITH MR.

Then this record follows. \" December 9, 1687, at a general town meeting, the town being then the general part of them together, then did hear the record which was between Mr. Gershom Hobart and the town of Groton, and there was very few or none of the inhabitants that had ever heard it before, and then they did see cause for to enter their dissent to this above record, and their reasons are these. \" 1. Their agreement with Mr. Hobart, for to give him eighty pounds, was upon this condition : that so long as the non-residents did pay with us, and no longer, and if they did get off from paying with us, then seventy pounds a year. 3 At a town meeting held August 12, 1689, it was agreed by James Parker, Jonas Prescott, John Farnsworth and Jo\u00abiah Parker, that if those who were unable to pay their tax in money, would bring their grain, wheat at 2s. Gd. per bushel, rye 2s Od , corn Is. 6a., within a week, they would receive it and pay the money, by which it would seem, that money was scarce, and that Mr. Hobart would not receive grain at half price."], [187, "163 MR. HOBART LEAVES THE TOWN. \" 2. The second reason is, because those men, that did engage for to pay money for those that brought them corn at * # * * per bushel was not entered, they do dissent from this agreement with the town, and refuse to take corn upon that account. \" By me, William Longley, Clerk, by order of the town.\" It is probable that the dissension became so great about this time, that Mr. Hobart left the town. For the next record in which he is mentioned, is under date of Oct. 27, 1690, when it is voted, \" that they will pay Mr. Hobart eighty pounds per year, according as it is written in the town book, for the year ensuing, provided he come and be with us, so that we have a constant supply of preaching the word on Lord's day, by himself or some other aulherdocks minister of the gospel.\" And on the ISth of June, following, it was voted, \" that they would stand to their covenant with Mr. Hobart, and honestly perform it to him, provided Mr. Hobart return to us and perform his duty amongst us, as was promised by him, when we en tered into covenant with him,\" he To this vote ten dissented. Mr. Hobart, however, did not listen favorably, and soon after, the town agreed to call a council respecting the settlement of some other minister ; and in December they voted, \"to invite some meet person to preach God's word to them,\" and chose a committee for that purpose ; and again in the same mouth, they voted, \" to give the minister, Mr. Hancock, eight pounds, money, for the fiist quarter of the year, and pay for his board besides.\" Other votes suc ceeded which amounted to a call for Mr. Hancock to settle as minister ; but in October, 1692, a vote passed to give Mr. Carter a call, and to give him sixty pounds for this year. In May, 1693, the town voted to hire Mr. Hobart's"], [188, "164 MR. HOBART INVITED TO RETURN. house for the minister, \" if they can have it upon rational terms.\" Also, to purchase a piece of land to build a house upon, to be the minister's forever. In August, of the same year, a committee was chosen to purchase a place for the ministry, and four places were \"propounded.\" \"Mr. Hobart's, Joshua Wheat's, John Lawrence's and James Parker's.\" October 2, 1693, the town chose James Parker, senior, and William Longley, \" for to go down and see for a minister to preach God's word to them.\" And on the ninth of the same month, wonderful to be told, they passed the following vote. \" At a general town meeting, legally warned, the major part of the town did by vote declare, that they would give Mister Gershom Hobart a call to be their settled minister, if he will take satisfaction with what the town can do for him ; and for his encouragement the town did declare by the major vote, that they would give to Mr. Hobart sixty pounds this present year ; one fourth part in money, the rest in corn and provision, at town price, and forty cords of wood ; and the said Mr. Hobart to rise and fall with the people ; as the providence of God may be towards the people, and the said town will be at the charge of fetching Mr. Hobart's family up again, and give five pounds towards the repairing Mr. Hobart's house.\" This vote was renewed on the fourteenth day of No vember following, with some slight variations and addi tions. The first states the price of provisions ; corn at three shillings per bushel, rye at four shillings, wheat at five shillings, cow beef three pence per pound, ox beef two and a half pence, and pork three pence. The wood to be paid by the last of January ; the sixty pounds, one half first of March, the other part first of December. The other, proposed seventy pounds per annum, and no wood. Which of the propositions Mr. Hobart accepted does not appear. In December and January, votes passed allowing"], [189, "MR. HOBART'S DEATH. 165 pay to sundry persons for fetching up Mr. Hobart's family and goods ; among others, \" the town did agree to allow good-wife Church two shillings, in town pay, and no more.\" This might be for setting Mr. Hobart's house in order to receive him.4 Nothing further respecting ministers appears till the last of the year 1703, and during 1704, when several votes passed respecting salary, by which it seems prob able, that Mr. Hobart preached till about the commence ment of the year 1705, and no longer. During the year 1705, a Mr. John Odly, [pitre, if it should not be Odlin, or Hoadley ?] preached and received a call by a town vote. The Rev. Gershom Hobart was one of the eight sons of Rev. Peter Hobart, first minister of Hingham, whose ancestry was from Hingham, in England, where the said Peter was himself born. From accounts of the Hobart family, given by Winthrop in his Journal, and by Lincoln in the History of Hingham, Gershom was not the only one of the name involved in difficulties and contentions. No record of the birth of any of his children can be found, but the children of three of his sons, Gershom, Shubael and Peter, are recorded, being born between 1715 and 1740. He is supposed to have died at Groton, December 19, 1705, aged 62. The immediate successor of Mr. Hobart, in the minis try, was the Rev. Dudley Bradstreet. The first notice of him in the town records is this : \" At a town meeting, legally warned, the 5th of March, 1706, the town did declare by vote, that they desire Mr. Bradstreet still, in order to settlement. At the same meeting, the town declare by vote, that they would give Mr. Bradstreet, for the ensuing year, seventy pounds ; one 4 Whether or not the reconciliation betwen the town or church, and Mr. Hobart, was brought about by an ecclesiastical council, does not appear, as the church records, if any were kept by Mr. H., are undoubtedly lost."], [190, "166 MR.

Benjamin Farnsworth, Joseph Gilson, S. Parker.\" In April, 1706, the town voted a settlement of one hundred pounds to Mr. Bradstreet, and in May, they voted as follows : \" That they would make a good house of thirty-eight feet long, and eighteen feet wide, and a lean-to of eleven feet wide all the length of the house, and they will finish it comfortably ; and that they would build a good little barn for Mr. Bradstreet.\" And at this last meeting the town chose a committee to let out the house and barn to be built, and to buy a place for the minister. It afterwards appears that they bought of Capt. Parker, and built the house now owned by Thomas J. Nutting, or a part of it, standing southeasterly of the burying ground. Nothing appears on record, but that Mr. Bradstreet and the people lived in peace and harmony till the year 1711, when, by votes passed, it seems that some difficul ties had arisen between them, and that advice had been taken of ministers and elders, which advice the town uniformly voted to follow. But nothing can be dis covered of what caused the troubles. The following record shows the conclusion of the matter, and the dis mission of Mr. Bradstreet. \" Whereas, at a meeting of the Rev. Elders and Mes sengers lately convened at Groton, April 15, 1712, and at the meeting of said Rev.

Dudley Bradstreet was born at Andover, April 27, 1678 ; graduated at Harvard College 1698 ; married Mary Wainwright May 4, 1704. His father and his grandfather, (one of the Governors of Massachusetts,) had the same given name, Dudley. After he had been dismissed from Groton, he went to England, and there received episcopal ordination ; but before commencing his return voyage, died suddenly of the small pox. The births of two children are recorded. Simon, born at Andover, March 7, 1705-6 ; baptized by Mr. Barnard, March 10. Dudley, born at Groton, March 12, 1707-8; baptized the 14th. The births of two children of Dudley Bradstreet and Abigail his wife, are recorded in Groton ; the first, June 27, 1728 ; the other, August 7, 1730; probably grand-chil dren of the minister. \"At a town meeting, December 25, 1712, the town voted to concur with the church in 'setting apart one day of humiliation in this town,' and to invite Mr. Whiting, of Concord, and Mr. Eveleth, of Stow, to assist in the same,\" probably on account of their being destitute of a settled minister. Before settling another minister, after the dismission of Mr. Bradstreet, three persons at least were hired as candi dates for settlement ; two of whom, Mr. Tufts and Mr. Cotton, received invitations to settle.

On the 2Sth of June, 1714, the town voted, that if Mr. Trowbridge would come and settle with them, as their minister, they would give him seventy pounds per annum till settlement, and eighty pounds afterwards, annually ; one hundred and twenty pounds for settlement and thirty acres of woodland. \"March 2, 1714-15. Caleb Trowbridge in officium pastorale suit aptid Grotonenses inauguratus.\" Mr. Trowbridge pursued the same method of recording marriages, baptisms and admissions to the church, that his predecessor had begun, and for about half the term of his ministry it appears, that due care was taken to make regular entries ; but in later time it is believed many omissions were made. The number of baptisms, from his ordination to 1720, were ninety-one, and the next succeeding twelve years only twenty-four are recorded, but a number of blanks are left in the records. Seventy-seven more are recorded by the year 1742, after which there are none. One hundred and fifty-seven persons were admitted to the church in full communion, and eighty-seven to the baptismal covenant. But many omissions were undoubt edly made in the latter part of his ministry. The marriages seem to have been more regularly recorded, and the whole number is three hundred and forty-nine couples. The proceedings of the church are more fully recorded by Mr. Trowbridge, than they had been by Mr. Brad street. The following are some of the most important. \" Groton, April 22, 1715.

At a town meeting, February 3, 1761, the town unani mously made choice of Mr. Samuel Dana, for their minis ter, and voted a settlement of two hundred pounds, and an annual salary of eighty pounds, or seventy pounds and good fire-wood, not exceeding thirty cords, at the election of Mr. Dana.

These regulations were signed by the moderator, and assented to by the pastor elect. One proposal made by the church was not assented to, viz., \" That a church meeting should be called at the request of ten members.\" Mr. Dana's objection to this was so strong, that the church, on the day of ordination, rescinded it, and notified the ordaining council of the fact. \" Samuel Dana in officium pastorale apud Grotonenses, inauguratus suit die Junii 3, 1761.\" At a church meeting, June 26, the foregoing covenant and regulations were consented to by the members, sig nified by \" the brethren holding up their hands, the sisters by standing up.\" Then follow the names of forty-two males, and forty-nine females ; one female omitted by mistake and entered on another page. Nothing appears on the records either of the town or the church, which shows that uninterrupted peace and har mony, between pastor and people, did not subsist till the relation between Great Britain and her American colonies assumed a warlike appearance. Mr. Dana, at that event ful crisis, believing that resistance would lead to greater evils, than were then endured, used his influence on the side of non-resistance. On a Sabbath in March, 1775, he preached a sermon 7 which gave great offence to the peo ple, who were generally inclined to unwavering resist ance. He was not allowed to enter the meeting-house on ' This was called the windy sermon, from the circumstance that it was on a very windy day, and while being delivered one of the horse stables was blown down."], [203, "179 CONFERENCE WITH MR.

Of the first class, fourteen confessed having committed the offence afore-mentioned, and of the last class, sixty-six, a propor tion not indicative of good customs and morals. Bap tisms, exclusive of adults, were seven hundred and seventy-two. Marriages, one hundred and sixty-six couples. During Mr. Dana's ministry two legacies, for the benefit of the poor of the church, were received, and the deacons chosen trustees thereof; one bequeathed by Captain Ephraim Sawtell, of thirteen pounds six shillings and eight pence, the other by Samuel Barron, the sum not being mentioned in the record. But at a subsequent meeting of the church, the sum of one pound twelve shil lings is mentioned as the annual interest thereof. The principal, therefore, was twenty-six pounds thirteen shil lings and four pence.

They had two sons and three daughters, born in Groton. After his dismission from the town and church, as above related, he continued some years in Groton, and preached, it is said, eighteen months to the Presbyterian society. Afterwards he removed to Amherst, New Hampshire. He read law, and went into the practice of it in Amherst, and was appointed judge of probate for the county of Hillsborough. He died at Amherst, April 2, 1798, and was buried with masonic ceremonies, he being one of that order, and master of Benevolent Lodge at the time of his death. St. Paul's Lodge, of Groton, attended, and the Hon. Timothy Bigelow, the master thereof, delivered an eulogy on the occasion. Between the dismission of the Rev. Samuel Dana and the ordination of the Rev. Daniel Chaplin, two candidates were employed to preach ; Mr. Chaplin and Mr. Bigelow. September 2, 1776, the town concurred with the church to hear these candidates four Sabbaths each.

This report was accepted, and a committee of five chosen to state the prices of the several articles of \" capital necessaries of life,\" who at the adjourned meeting made the following report. \"The committee appointed to state the prices of the articles named in the former report, &c, having taken great pains to ascertain their prices in 1774, obtained from two noted merchants, the prices of West India goods, as sold by them, therefore report, 5. d. q - Wheat, 6 0 0 per bushel.

Whereupon the town voted to add one hun dred pounds to the proposed settlement, and again voted on the question whether they would have Mr. Chaplin for their minister, by yeas and nays ; and upon counting, there were one hundred and one yeas, fourteen nays, and two neuters. To this second invitation Mr. Chaplin gave an affirmative answer October 27, 1777 ; and the first day of January, 1778, was fixed upon for his ordina tion, which took place accordingly. Previous to the ordination, a committee of the church made report, \" that the church covenant be continued as recorded in the church book.\" \" That the terms of communion be the same as were established. also be put in. Perhaps neither the committee, nor the town collectively, perceived the unequal bearing the several articles would have in the com putation, though it seems incredible, for the record says, \" the report was read several times, and duly considered by the town.\" The salary was annually computed by committees of the town, or first parish, according to the report of this committee, till 1807, when, by agreement, the sum of the annual salary was fixed at six hundred and fifty dollars, which was continued to 1821, and then the interest of Groton ministerial fund, amounting to about the same sum, was adopted, which was regularly paid to January 7, 1826. The salary for the year 17S2, by the foregoing computation, amounted to \u00a3115 6s. 4Ad \u2014$334,39. In 1788, it was \u00a377 11s. 2|d.\u2014 $258,54. In 1806, it was $669,30. It appears by the town records, that the town was culpably negligent in paying Mr. Chaplin the two hundred pounds settlement, as well as the first four or five years' salary. The excuse, if any plausible one could be given, for so long delay of payment, would probably be the distressed cir cumstances of the town, in raising men, paying them, and providing them clothing and provisions in the war of the revolution, and the depreciated state of the common currency.

The correspondence with the church and town of West ford, and with the aggrieved party there, are also named as on file, and a vote to attend an ecclesiastical coun cil there by the pastor and two delegates, is recorded.

And to proceed with the greatest care and deliberation, the letter missive from the aggrieved, the result of the council, the letter from the church of Westford, and the letter from the aggrieved desiring occa sional communion with us, were all read, and the church went into a mature, lengthy and cool debate upon the subject. After a while the question was put, whether the 24"], [210, "186 Jonathan Lawrence's legacy. church approve of the result ; and it passed in the affirm ative by a great majority. And also whether the church will grant the request of the aggrieved, to admit them to occasional communion, so long as their situation shall remain such that they cannot enjoy the privileges of the ordinances at home, upon such terms as they can con scientiously comply with? passed in the affirmative by a great majority.\" At a church meeting, July 5, 1782, the four deacons Farwell, Stone, Farnsworth, and Bancroft, with Israel Robert, Esq., were chosen trustees of the twenty pounds given by Jonathan Lawrence for the benefit of the ordained minister or ministers of Groton, with power to take and receive the same of Samuel Dana, the late pastor ; if need be, to sue him upon his bond given therefor. Also to offer the same to Rev. Daniel Chaplin, if he will receive it, otherwise put it out upon interest, and pay over to said Chaplin the interest thereon. No thing further appears upon the records respecting that fund. It was probably put into Mr. Chaplin's hands, and his ministry lasting about half a century, those acquainted with the transaction were no longer members of the church, or had no recollection thereof. The disaffection with the preaching of Mr. Chaplin, which resulted in the disruption of the church and society, and the organization of a Presbyterian church and society in the town, is first mentioned in the church records under date of September 30, 1782, when great dissatisfaction is expressed with \"the brethren Col.

He also communicated a letter addressed to the church in Groton, from the Presbyterian churches in Boston, Peterboro' and others, informing, that they had taken the Presbyterian church in Groton under their care. Whereupon, the church chose a committee to consider the application of Mr. Dana, and said letter, and also to consider what measures should be taken with other members of this church, who had partaken of the ordinances with Presby terians. This committee afterwards reported in sub stance, that the church should forget and forgive every thing of a political nature where Mr. Dana had offended, while their pastor ; but that his conduct since his dis mission, in preaching and administering the ordinances to the Presbyterians, they could not forgive ; but recommend, that a committee be chosen to confer with him on the subject, whenever he should come to Groton.

Whether it were not agreeable to the spirit of re ligion, and apostolic practice, to admit persons to the ordinances, upon their assent to the church covenant, without further declarations of reformation, and whether this should not for the future be the practice of this church. 3. Whether the practice of making acknowledgements or confessions before the congregation, by members in full communion, and others, for any immoralities, should be discontinued. The first and third propositions were adopted, and the second postponed for further consideration, and finally rejected. April 5, 1803. A committee having been previously chosen to confer with brother Jonas Stone, for his neglect to attend public worship and the ordinances, reported, that brother Stone gave for excuse of his delinquency the use of instrumental music in the religious services, which he considered unscriptural, and the church tolerat ing that part of worship to be managed altogether by young people.

Brazcr, Esq., presented to the church a cloth, for the com munion table ; and October 1, 1818, James Brazer, Esq., presented two flagons, the cost of which was fifty dollars, and both received the thanks of the church. Nothing further of any importance appears to have been transacted by the church during the long ministry of Dr. Chaplin, till he had become unable, through the infirmi ties of age, to perform its duties. But as soon as that good shepherd could no longer watch over and feed his flock, and a stranger undertook to lead it to unwonted pastures, the sheep would not all follow, and a permanent separation of the flock ensued. To give a particular and minute account of all the transactions which produced a permanent separation of the town into two parishes, or societies, and caused the formation of a second church, would, it is deemed, be an unprofitable labor. A general statement, only, of the principal matters leading to the final result, is as much as will tend to edification. On Sunday, July 10, 1S25, being a very hot day, Dr. Chaplin, towards the close of his discourse in the after noon, fainted in his pulpit, and was led out of the house, and never again preached therein. For a few Sabbaths afterwards, however, he made prayers, and sermons were read by some of the parishioners. Then, a licentiate from Andover Theological Institution, without any invi tation or agency of the town or church, appeared and conducted the services, with the exception of two Sab baths, till Thanksgiving-day, November 24, 1825. November 14, 1825. The church voted, seventeen to eight, to give Mr. John Todd (the licentiate above named) a call to become colleague pastor with Dr. Chaplin. At a town meeting, November 25, 1825, called to see if the town would unite with the church in the settle ment of Mr. Todd, after long debate upon the question,"], [220, "196 OCCASIONAL PREACHING. the inhabitants voted, \" to pass over the article,\" by a large majority. At the same meeting, they voted and chose a committee to hire preaching, in case of Dr. Chap lin's inability to preach himself, for a term of four months. This committee consulted with Dr. Chaplin, on the sub ject of their duty, who requested them to state in writing of what religious tenets the person should be, whom they should hire to preach. This they declined, claiming the right to act for the town, without dictation from him on this point. After some debate, it was mutually agreed, that the committee should procure ordained ministers to preach, for a few Sabbaths. Soon after, the committee waited on Dr. Chaplin, to agree upon some other arrange ment, when he informed them, that he would procure a supply for the pulpit. To this, the committee objected, claiming the right of the town to choose their minister ; and on this question, whether Dr. Chaplin, when super annuated and unable to lead in public worship, should provide such preaching as he pleased, or whether the town had the right to choose their own preacher, such proceedings were had, as led to a final separation of the town into two parishes. The town insisted on exercising their rights, as they understood them, and on the twenty first of January, 1826, two ministers were provided to preach ; one by Dr. Chaplin, and the other by the town's committee. The latter preached ; and from that day, Dr. Chaplin, with a majority of the church and a minority of the town, seceded, and soon after formed a separate society. This, however, did not terminate the strife be tween the parties. The seceding members of the church claimed to be the church, and attempted to control those who continued with the majority of the parish, and who claimed to be, and were, according to a decision of the Supreme Court, the church. The latter, perceiving no hopes of a reconciliation, proceeded, according to their rights, to hold meetings, have the ordinances administered,"], [221, "MR. ROBINSON CALLED. 197 and take measures to procure and ordain a pastor and minister. For these proceedings the seceders undertook to censure them ; and, assuming themselves to be the church, persevered even to the form of excommunication. Eight of the male members of the church, after having been visited, conversed with, and summoned to appear at a church meeting, held by the seceders, received each a written notice of their excommunication. One only of the number so dealt with, censured, and pretendedly ex communicated, made any answer or reply to the proceed ings, and that one stood upon his defence, maintaining that the seceders were not the church, and that those who remained with the majority of the town, were properly and legally the church, and that by having had the ordinances administered, though contrary to a vote of the seceders, which was the principal accusation against them, no censurable offence had been committed. On the twenty-third day of July, 1826, being a little time before the pretended excommunications had been issued, the church proper made choice of the Rev. Charles Robinson for their pastor, and at a town meeting, called for that purpose, August fourth, succeeding, the inhabi tants chose him as their minister, one hundred and forty three to sixty-nine, and the first day of November was appointed for his instalment. Between the secession of the Rev. Dr. Chaplin, and the instalment of Mr. Robinson, eight persons were admitted members of the church on original profession, and one from another church. Daniel Chaplin, D. D., was born at Rowley, December 30, 1743, son of Jonathan Chaplin and Mary Boynton his wife. Hugh Chaplin, grandfather of Daniel, came from England about eighteen years after the landing of the pilgrims at Plymouth, a young man, who settled at Rowley."], [222, "198 dr. chaplin's life, Dr. Chaplin did not commence his studies in early life. In his youth he worked with his father in husbandry and coopering. He prepared for college at Dummer academy, and did not enter till he was twenty-six years of age. He took his first degree at Harvard college with the class of 1772, and was said to be one of the best scholars in the class. He studied theology with Dr. Haven, at Ports mouth, New Hampshire ; was ordained at Groton, Jan. 1, 1778; married Susanna Prescott, a daughter of the Hon. James Prescott of Groton, June 24, 1779, by whom he had three sons and five daughters. One son and two daughters only survived him. As evidence of his scholarship, it may be stated, that he was invited, soon after his ordination at Groton, to take the superintendence of Phillips academy at Exeter, New Hampshire. He received the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity, from Harvard college in 1817. With the exception of the short time between his ordina tion and the final separation of the Presbyterians from the church and society, he lived in a state of much harmony with the church and people of his charge, during the long period of his ministry. He did not abound in \" worldly wealth and riches,\" by many deemed necessary to con tentment and happiness ; but he possessed a calmness and serenity of mind, a social as well as devotional spirit, which enabled him to pass by the objects that cause cares and troubles, envyings and repinings, to those of a different temperament. Though of a serious, sober, and elevated turn of mind, he was affable, sociable and cheerful in his intercourse with his parishioners, and enjoyed satisfaction in seeing them prosperous and happy in their lawful pursuits and undertakings. He entered not into the political strifes and contentions of his time, but was clear and decided in his views and principles, which were always in accordance with those of Washington and other patriots, who formed and endeavored"], [223, "199 CHARACTER, AND DEATH. to perpetuate the federal institutions of our country, and he fearlessly expressed them on all proper occasions. He was firm, consistent, stable, conservative, in all his opinions and transactions. His public discourses were didactic and practical, rather than doctrinal ; he taught the great and essential duties of morality aud Christianity, more than the particular tenets of any sect : all Christians, therefore, could pro nounce his teachings orthodox. In associations or eccle siastical councils, his decisions were always on the side of liberality and true Christian charity, and his opinions were much respected and regarded by the clergy with whom he had intercourse. The course he pursued, after he could no longer per form the ministerial duties, may appear somewhat at variance with his general character here portrayed ; but considering that the rank, power and authority of the clergy at the time of his ordination and during a part of his ministry had been lost by modern innovations ; and also considering his connections at this time, partly of necessity and partly accidental, there is no mystery in the case ; so that no imputation of voluntary wrong should be imputed to him by those acquainted with all the circumstances and relations, in which he stood. He preached a sermon in the Union meeting-house the first Sabbath in January, 1828, half a century after his ordination. The infirmities of age came gradually upon his vener able form, till the eighth day of April, 1S31, when his immortal part left its tabernacle of clay, and fled to its permanent habitation. The number of church members admitted during Dr. Chaplin's ministry, was two hundred and twenty, viz. seventy males and one hundred and fifty females. Se venty-five owned the baptismal covenant, in order to their children's receiving the rite of baptism ; and one"], [224, "200 OBJECTIONS TO MR. ROBINSON'S ORDINATION. thousand three hundred and sixty-two children were bap tized by him. Five hundred and fifty-five couples took the marriage covenant in his presence. The Rev. Charles Robinson was the seventh minister of Groton. An unavailing attempt was made by those inhabitants of the town, who for the year previous had held meetings and attended worship separate from the majority of the town, to prevent his instalment. On the first Sunday after the town had chosen Mr. Robinson for their minister, a notice signed by Dr. Chaplin was posted at the meeting-house, calling a church meeting \" to take into consideration the subject of giving the Rev. Charles Robinson an invitation to become their colleague pastor.\" This call was of course intended for the seceders, who accordingly met at the meeting-house, which being closed, the meeting was opened on the door-steps ; and the ques tion having been put, whether they would invite the Rev. Mr. Robinson to become colleague pastor, the yeas were none, the nays twenty. On the evening previous to the instalment of Mr. Robinson, a very large and respectable council having convened for that purpose, the committee of the church and town laid before them the proceedings of the church and town, in the choice of Mr. Robinson, and the pro visions for his support. Three persons from among the seceders appeared before the council, claiming to be a committee of the church, and laid before them a written remonstrance, of very great length, against the proposed instalment. The two principal objections were, \" 1. That a religious teacher or pastor cannot be called and settled over this church and parish, without the joint concurrence of each body, expressed by a separate vote. 2. That the Rev. Charles Robinson has never been invited to become our pastor by the joint concurrence of the first church and parish in Groton.\""], [225, "201 MR. ROBINSON INSTALLED AND DISMISSED. In regard to the first of these points there is no impos sibility in the case, and no difference between this and other parishes and churches, except that if a minister should be installed or ordained, without the \" joint con currence \" of the church aud parish, he would not be entitled to the proceeds of Groton ministerial fund, but must look for his support from his people, as will more fully appear in the chapter in relation to said fund. And as to the second point, the proceedings before related entirely contradict it. The remonstrants proceeded at great length to sub stantiate these points with a variety of statements, but were unable to convince the council of the truth of the last ; so whether the first were true or false was not material. The Rev. Charles Robinson was, therefore, on the first day of November, 1826, duly installed minister of the town or first parish in Groton, and pastor of the church thereof. On the same day the seceders kept a fast and attended religious exercises at the house of Dr. Chaplin. A settlement of two hundred dollars, and an annual salary of seven hundred dollars, payable quarter yearly, were voted by the town to Mr. Robinson, and in the contract was the condition, that after the expiration of five years, if the town or parish should vote by a majority of two-thirds to dismiss Mr. Robinson, and give him notice thereof in writing ; or if the said Robinson should wish to be dismissed, and give notice thereof in writing, in either case the contract and relation between the town or parish and said Robinson should cease. The connection between the church, the parish, and the Rev. Mr. Robinson, subsisted with much harmony for the space of about fourteen years, when he gave notice of his desire to be dismissed. His contract and connection accordingly ceased in September, 1838. The Rev. Charles Robinson was born at Exeter, New Hampshire, July 25, 1793 ; prepared for college at 26"], [226, "202 MR.

After his dismission at Groton, he was installed at Medfield, Massachusetts, where he still resides. During his residence in Groton, (1827,) he married Jane, the only daughter of Stuart J. Park, Esq., by whom he had one child, who died in infancy ; his wife died soon after. He afterwards ( 1830) married Diantha, daughter of John Pientiss, Esq., of Keene, New Hampshire, who died, May, 1843 ; and he has since married Sally Cotton, of Boylston, by whom he had one child, lately deceased. During Mr. Robin son's ministry at Groton, sixty-four persons, eighteen males and forty-six females, were added to the church. Complete records of baptisms are not found. The num ber of marriages was eighty-nine. October 6, 1S35. The church unanimously made choice of the Rev. George W. Wells of Kennebunk, Maine, to be their pastor ; and the first parish, on the eighth day of the same month, by vote of sixty-nine to fifteen, voted to invite him to become their minister, with a salary of eight hundred dollars per annum, payable quarterly, in four equal instalments. To these invitations and proposals Mr. Wells gave an affirmative answer, and he was installed, Nov. 21, 1835, having been previously ordained at Kennebunk. During the short period of Mr. Wells' ministry, thirty two persons, eight males and twenty-four females, were added to the church, and twenty-five couples were joined by him in marriage.

Before being regularly established, he preached a while in Boston and Baltimore ; after which he was happily settled in Kennebunk, Maine, in October, 1827, where he remained eleven years. His health, never very robust, at length decidedly failing in the severe climate and bleak exposure of the coast, on which that town lies, he was obliged to seek a milder sky, and preached successfully one winter in Savannah, Georgia. Somewhat recruited, he hoped to be able to endure again the rigors of a northern winter ; but he was urged by advice to which he could not be deaf, to leave Kenne bunk, which he did with unspeakable regret. In No vember, 1838, he was installed in Groton, where he ministered with great acceptance and success. But again his health broke under the arduous trials of the profession, made doubly hard and exhausting by his ardent spirit and indefatigable perseverance. He preached for the last time on the first Sabbath in February. He died Friday morning, March 17, 1843, in the thirty-ninth year of his age ; and from childhood till that time, it can be said of him without doubt or misgiving, as strongly as of any one, that he led a pure and blameless life. It falls not to a man to be sinless ; but we know of nothing in his whole career which his friends would desire to forget, or need to cover with any mantle of charitable construction. In very early life he was distinguished for his love of truth, for the early development of religious faith, and a moral fortitude. He passed through every study, grade and station with honor, till he became an ambassador for Christ ; in which capacity he has throughout been remarkable for the depth and gravity, and a certain tone of reality, with which he brought personally home to each hearer's mind the several themes of his address.

His most conspicuous trait \" \u2014 \" was humility ; and by this we mean, not so much a feeling of self-distrust, (for he respected and relied upon the powers God had given him,) as an absence of all pre tension and self-exaltation. He set up no claim. He thrust in no interference. He invaded no man's place or right. He envied no man's distinction. He craved no man's praise. . . . Truly he had studied the character of Him who was meek and lowly in heart, and gained the fundamental qualification of a Christian minister, by being a Christian.\" Mr. Wells married Lucia G. Fairfield, of Boston, by whom he had two sons and a daughter, who all survive him. On the 28th day of May, 1843, the church unanimously made choice of Mr. Joseph Couch Smith to be their pastor ; on the next day the parish chose him for their minister. He was accordingly ordained, July 12, 1843, and remains the settled minister to this time, 1847. He married Augusta H. Lord, of Kennebunk, who died in June, 1844 ; and he has since married Margaret A. Brig ham, of Groton. The seceders from the first parish in Groton having built a house of worship, as has been stated in the pre ceding chapter, invited Mr. John Todd to become their minister and pastor, and he accepted the invitation. On the third day of January, 1827, the day on which the house of worship was dedicated to that service, Mr. Todd was ordained to the pastoral charge of the \" Union church,\" so denominated, which, consisting of thirty members, had been organized, November 21, 1826.

The reason of such procedure seems to have been, if we judge of motives by actions, that the members might use the inconsistent privilege of voting and acting in a religious society, where they did not worship.

Joab Brace, of Wrethersfield, Connecticut. He continued in his charge over the Union society till January 8, 1833, when he was dismissed at his own request. He has since been installed and re installed ; first over the Edwards church at Northampton, January 30, 1833 ; at Philadelphia, November 17, 1836 ; and he is now the pastor of a church in Pittsfield, Mass. During his ministry one hundred and thirty-three mem bers were admitted to the Union church. The Rev. Charles B. Kittredge was the second pastor of the Union church. He was born at Mount Vernon, New Hampshire, July 4, 1806; graduated at Dartmouth Col lege, 1828 ; studied theology at Andover ; ordained Octo ber 15, 1833. The time of his ministry here was short. He was dismissed August 31, 1835, and has since been installed at Westboro', Massachusetts, February 8, 1837 ; and at Monson, Massachusetts, October 21, 1S46, as col league pastor with Rev. Dr. Ely.

The deacons of the Union church are, Walter Dickson and Isaiah Cragin, chosen November 19, 1S36 ; Jonathan S. Adams, Curtis Lawrence and Charles Dickson, chosen January 16, 1840. Charles Dickson resigned 1847. No regular organization of a third religious society in Groton was had until November 7, 1831, when fifteen individuals, of the Baptist denomination, formed them selves into a society, and chose parish officers. They had hitherto been too small in number to support constant preaching, but at this time they voted to have preaching one-third of the time, on Sabbaths, to the then next April. Capt. Josiah Clark, one of the members, gene rously gave them the use of his commodious hall, in the centre of the town, and the Rev. Amasa Sanderson engaged to preach to them during that time. At the annual meeting of the society in March, 1832, the sum of four hundred dollars was voted to be raised, and hopes were entertained of an addition thereto, from for eign aid, for the support of preaching the ensuing year. Again, the Rev. Mr. Sanderson, upon an invitation of the society, consented to supply for that year, and for that sum. December 5, 1832, an ecclesiastical council was held for the purpose, and a church, composed of eleven males and eighteen females, was duly organized. The church and society from this time gradually increased in num bers and strength ; yet the struggle was long and arduous before they could build themselves a house for worship, and support a constant administration of Christian ordi nances. Their patient and persevering pastor continued to supply the desk in the years from 1834 to 1837, par tially, and afterwards constantly, except for short intervals of sickness, till May, 1843, when, from feeble health, he"], [231, "207 REV. MESSRS. SANDERSON, PINNEY, HOLMES. resigned his charge. The society had been enabled in the mean time to build a neat and commodious house for worship, as stated in the preceding chapter. The Rev. Amasa Sanderson was born, April 16, 1797, at Gardiner, Maine, but his father dying in the son's early childhood, he was removed to Weston, Massachusetts. He began his preparatory studies for the ministry in De cember, 1816, under the private tuition of the Rev. and Hon. Charles Train, of Framingham. He was ordained pastor over the Baptist church and society in Littleton, July 9, 1823, in which charge he remained till April, 1831, when he resigned. He lives still in Groton, in peaceful retirement. The number of church members during his administra tion was eighty-seven ; forty-five of whom were added by baptism. The whole number dismissed, or otherwise removed, was twenty-three ; leaving in the church, at the close of his ministry, sixty-four. The Rev. Alfred Pinney, from Auburn, in the State of New York, was the second minister of the Baptist society in Groton. He was invited and took the charge in August, 1843, and continued in it one year only. During his ministry, eight members were added to the church, and sixteen were dismissed or otherwise removed. The Rev. Lewis Holmes is the third and present pastor of the Baptist church. He was born at Plymouth, Mass., April 12, 18 L3; graduated at Waterville College, 1840; first ordained and settled over the Baptist church and so ciety in Edgarton, Massachusetts, January 10, 1841; accepted the pastoral charge of the Baptist church in Groton, May, 1845."], [232, "CHAPTER X.

Sartell \u2014 Attempts to divide or misapply the Fund. Mr. Shadrach Whitney, an inhabitant of Groton, (probably a bachelor, as he makes no provision for wife or children,) made his will July 20, 1764, which was proved, approved and allowed August 14th of the same year, and in which, after making several devises and bequests to relatives and friends, made the following to the town of Groton : \" My will is, and I do hereby give and bequeath to the town of Groton the sum of forty pounds to be paid by my executor, hereafter named, within two years after my de cease, to be improved for their use forever hereafter, in manner following, viz., for the said town to let out said money upon interest, in such way and manner as. they shall think fit, so that the interest thereof may be improved and applied for and towards the support of the ordained minister of the town of Groton, from time to time, forever hereafter.\" On the third day of September, 1775, Josiah Sartell, Esq., of Groton, possessed of a large estate, made his last will and testament, in which, after amply providing for his wife Mary, and making large bequests to sundry"], [233, "COL. JOSIAH SARTELL'S WILL. 209 relations and friends, and for charitable purposes, he gives to the town of Groton as follows, viz. : \" My will is, and I do hereby give aud bequeath to the town of Groton, forever, the annual income or rents of that piece of land in said Groton, where John Archibald now dwells, to be applied towards the support of the gospel minister in said town. \" My will is, and I do hereby give and bequeath to the town of Groton the sum of one hundred and thirty-three pounds six shillings and eightpence, the interest of which, one year after my decease, to be annually applied towards the support of a gospel minister in said town for ever. \" My will is, and I do hereby give and bequeath to the town of Groton for ever, (after the decease of my wife,) all the buildings and lands which I have heretofore given her during life, [two farms,] to use and improve for ever; and positively order, that the same be not sold, but that they be rented out, and the premises kept in good repair forever hereafter, and that the overplus of the rents be annually applied towards the suppoit of the gospel minister in said town ; and this to be under the inspection and direction of the three senior selectmen by choice in said town for ever.\" After the execution of his will, Col. Sartell was not satisfied with the preaching of the Rev. D. Chaplin, the settled minister of the town. He was one of the prin cipal men, and a leader of those who separated from the town, and formed the Presbyterian society. He aided in building their meeting-house and in providing preaching therein, but died previous to their incorporation. It is a reasonable supposition, therefore, that had he made his will at a later period, or had taken an opportunity to alter it, he would have provided for the minister of that parish, rather than that of the first parish. He was probably waiting for its incorporation. The will was presented to the Supreme Judicial Court, for probate, (Hon. O.

The Court, however, after hearing the case, decided, that the testator was sane, and that the cancelling made void only the cancelled clauses. The will was consequently approved and allowed. His widow, Mary Sartell, died March 30, 1790, whereupon the lands devised to the town, as above recited, came into possession, and for a number of years were rented by the three senior selectmen, according to the provision of the will. It was found upon trial, that the farms under lease became deteriorated, that a large proportion of the rents must annually be applied to keeping in repair the fences and buildings, and that the \" overplus of the rents \" was consequently very small. Upon application of the first parish, the General Court, February 21, 1804, passed an act incorporating the three senior selectmen by choice, the treasurer of the first parish, and the junior deacon by age of the church in said parish, all for the time being, by the name and style of \" The Trustees of Groton Ministerial Fund,\" with the customary powers and privileges of similar corporations. They are empowered by said act \" to take, have, hold, use, improve and manage any estate real or personal, the annual income whereof shall not exceed two thousand dollars, in trust for the support and maintainance of the gospel ministry in said parish ; and whenever the net annual income or interest of such fund or estate shall amount to the sum of six hundred dollars, and not before,"], [235, "211 FARMS SOLD. the said trustees shall proceed to pay the same quarterly to such teacher or teachers of religion as shall be regu larly ordained and settled in said parish, by the joint concurrence of the inhabitants and church thereof.\" The trustees, however, received no funds to manage till March 12, 1813. May 1, 1809, the inhabitants of the town voted unani mously lo make sale of the lands given by the late Josiah Sartell, Esq., deceased, for the support of a gospel minister, and to pay over and deliver the proceeds of the sales to the trustees of Groton ministerial fund, and chose a committee and empowered them to perform that service. To obviate all scruples about the right of the town to sell said lands, when in the will the devisor had expressly ordered that they should not be sold, application was made to the General Court to pass an act authorising such sales. February 27, 1811, an act was accordingly passed, by which the inhabitants of Groton were \"fully empowered to sell, and execute a deed or deeds by a committee of three persons, or any two of them, to convey the whole or any part of the real estate devised to the said inhabit ants by the last will and testament of Josiah Sawtell,' Esq., late of said Groton, deceased, for the support of a gospel minister in said town, and the proceeds of any such sales shall be paid over to the trustees of Groton ministerial fund, and be denominated, The Sawtell1 dona tion for the support of a gospel minister in the first parish in Groton.

Soon after, the Archibald land was also sold for about the sum of five hundred dollars, which was also paid over to said trustees. The pecuniary legacy was not received for want of sufficient estate. About the same time the first parish appropriated the sum of fifteen hundred dollars for the purpose of increas- ing the fund ; and the legacy of Mr. Shadrach Whitney, abovementioned, with several years' interest, was also put into the hands of the trustees ; and the parish, December 2, 1814, further granted the proceeds of the sale of six pews in the meeting-house, amounting to five hundred and thirty-eight dollars. These several sums were loaned upon interest by the trustees, and securities taken, as the trustees are obliged by their act of incorporation, by mortgages upon real estate of three times the value of the sums loaned ; and the interest being annually added to the principal, the fund rose to the amount of ten thousand dollars and upwards, yielding an annual income of six hundred dollars by the middle of the year 1S20. The Presbyterian society having for a long time ceased to act as a parish, and but very few of its members being alive and resident in Groton, the first parish, October 25, IS 19, voted, \"that the distinction or name of first parish be discontinued from and after the first Monday of April Parker offered four thousand dollars for them, which was the highest bid made, and they were struck off to him. But being unwilling or unable to comply with the conditions of sale, the conveyance was not made. Where upon Mr. Job Shattuck, junior, proposed to tbe town to take a deed of the farms at the sum bid by Mr. Parker, and pay for them by supporting the town's paupers for the term of live years. To this proposition the town assented, and ordered their treasurer to give bis note to the trustees of Groton ministerial fund, for the sum of four thousand dollars, to be paid in five equal annual instalments. This arrangement was carried into complete operation. Mr. Shattuck supported the poor for the term agreed upon, and the town treasurer's note was paid with interest, according to its tenor."], [237, "AMOUNT OF THE FUNDS. 213 next.\" After payment of all debts of the parish, the balance left in the treasury, being $994 66, was transferred to the ministerial fund. From the 7th of July, IS20, the trustees commenced paying the income to the settled minister, in quarterly instalments, according to the provision of the statute ; since which time the fund has received no additions, except the interest accruing thereon while there has been no regularly ordained or settled minister in the first parish. The amount of interest added, accruing between the Rev. Dr. Chaplin's ceasing to officiate, and the installation of the Rev. C. Robinson, was $500 ; between the dismission of the Rev. C. Robinson and the installation of the Rev. Charles W. Wells, $100; and from the death of Mr. Wells to the ordination of the Rev. Joseph C. Smith, $200. So that the principal of the fund now loaned upon interest is $11,750. That part thereof denominated the Sawtell donation, he, is $9,121 ; Mr. Whitney's donation is $268 26 ; and what has been given by the parish $2,360 74. After the Union church and society had been organized, it was deemed proper, that an alteration should be made in that part of the statute which designates who shall be trustees. For reasons set forth therein, the trustees pre ferred the following petition to the Legislature : \" To the Honorable Senate and House of Representa tives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in General Court assembled, on the first Wednesday of January, A.

The trustees, according to the statute by which they were incorporated, keep the fund constantly loaned upon interest, in manner as before stated, and pay the interest to the ordained minister of the parish in four quarterly equal instalments, and make annual reports of their doings and a statement of the condition of the fund, to the parish, naming therein the several donors and the limitations in the terms of the donations. Soon after the secession of those who formed the Union church and society, an heir at law of Josiah Sartell, Esq.,3 made an entry upon the land devised to the town, and sold as before stated, and commenced an 3 William Brigham and Sarah his wife in her right commenced the suit."], [239, "215 ATTEMPT TO DIVIDE OR MISAPPLY FUNDS. action of ejectment against Samson Shattuck, the tenant in possession, on supposition of a forfeiture by sale or otherwise. Mr. Shattuck gave notice of the suit to the town, and a committee was chosen to defend. After much time and expense to both parties, in preparation for trial, a decision was made by the judges of the Supreme Judicial Court, which, however, did not meet the sup posed merits of the case, whether or not there had been a forfeiture ; but only, that in case of a forfeiture, the lands would revert to the residuary legatees, and not to the heirs at law. At a meeting of the second parish or Union Orthodox Society, February 4, 1S33, it was voted, \" to discontinue and dissolve said parish, and to return the names of the several individuals belonging to said parish to the clerk of the first parish,\" which being ninety-six in number, were so returned ; and afterwards these individuals claimed the right to vote in the first parish, although they continued to worship and maintain preaching in tl.s Union meeting house, as heretofore. And on the fourth day of May, 1S35, a meeting of the first parish was held at the special request of fourteen voters, to act on the following article, viz. \"To see if the parish will agree to divide the minis terial fund, and to instruct the trustees to make arrange ments to pay it over in equal shares to each of the legal voters of the parish.\" Preposterous and absurd as such vote would have been, 114 out of 272, those whose names had been returned as abovementioned being per mitted to vote, (whether legally or not was not worth while to inquire, as no vote of the parish could control the trustees,) were found in favor of acting in the matter. About the same time much conversation was had on dividing the fund, or appropriating its proceeds to other purposes than the support of the gospel ministry ; and even the opinions of counsel esteemed eminent were asked, on the feasibility or possibility of dividing it, or"], [240, "216 STABILITY AND USEFULNESS OF THE FIND. diverting it from its originally intended purpose. It seems now, however, to be conceded, that so far as human ingenuity can eflect it. the fund is placed beyond the reach of that malevolence, which would either divide, destroy, or divert it from its legal, just and appropriate usefulness. Indeed, so safely is it guarded by legal enactments, and so severe are the penalties imposed upon the trustees for any mismanagement or dereliction of duty, that it would seem nothing short of entire destitution, not only of common honesty and integrity, but also of all pecuniary worth in each and all of the trustees, or of a total prostration of our present institutions, moral, legal and politic, can prevent its permanency and appropriate application. This fund, under the present condition of parishes, when every one can at pleasure absolve himself from all legal obligation to assist in support of the ministry of the gospel, promises a permanent supply to the parish, with out burdensome taxation, although it should be reduced to few in number. Its income now nearly pays the minister's salary, and the time may come, after a few more vacancies of an ordained minister, or some bene volent donation, when it will afford a generous salary, and no assessments will be necessary, except for ordinary parochial charges."], [241, "CHAPTER XI Schools and education \u2014 First votes about schools \u2014 School house \u2014 Town indicted \u2014 School bill \u2014 Petition for grant of land \u2014 Schools kept in several angles \u2014 Grammar school in four places \u2014 Town again indicted \u2014 Children numbered \u2014 Town again indicted \u2014 Dis- tricts formed \u2014 A better system adopted \u2014 By-laws adopted and altered \u2014 First library \u2014 Second library \u2014 United \u2014 First parish li- brary \u2014 Groton Lyceum \u2014 Groton Academy \u2014 Association \u2014 Sub- scribers \u2014 Incorporation \u2014 List of trustees \u2014 List of preceptors \u2014 Embarassments \u2014 Grant of lands \u2014 Sale and relief from debts \u2014 Small donations \u2014 Mrs. Brazer's bequest \u2014 Generous donations of William and Amos Lawrence \u2014 Change of corporate name \u2014 Further donations \u2014 Future prospects.

The petition sets forth, that there are not one hundred families in the town, that the grand jury never intended a grammar school, that the town had been provided with a school master to teach children to read and write according to law ; and, therefore, hope to be discharged from presentment. The original petition is endorsed thus : \" ordered and done.\" So it is supposed, the indictment was not followed by conviction. \" April 16, 1728, voted, that Benjamin Parker, William Lawrence and Samuel Tarbell be a committee, to receive of Mr. Nathaniel Sawtell the bell for the school, by him presented to the town, and render thanks to him for the same, in behalf of the town, and to erect and set up the same upon or near our school-house, at the charge of the town.\" Nothing further has been learned, either from record or tradition, in relation to a school bell."], [243, "219 PETITION FOR LAND. \" July 23, 1734.

But in 1741, votes were passed to have the school kept in five places, six weeks in each place. And in 1742, seven places for the school were thus designated, viz., first, to begin at the school-house on the west side the meadow, then at Unkety, then at Eleazer Gilson's, then at Hezekiah Sawtell's, then at Nissitissett, then at the middle, of the town, and then at John Gilson's. These locations cannot at this time be precisely pointed out. The west side of the meadow, and the middle of the town, are sufficiently understood ; Unkety, or Unque tenassett, is the part of Groton set off to Dunstable ; Nissitissett to Pepperell, and Hezekiah Sawtell's is known to have been where Capt. John Rock wood now lives. One of the Gilson's was probably in the east part, and the other in the south. In 1745, a committee were chosen to consider and re port, concerning the schools, who, at the town meeting May 17, 1745, made the following report. \" The committee appointed to consider where the school shall be kept, for the year ensuing, have met and taken the affair under consideration, aud find it not pos sible to settle it, so that every one may reap an equal"], [244, "220 GRAMMAR SCHOOL IN FOUR PLACES. benefit ; but are humbly of opinion, that it may be most for the advantage of the town, that the school may be kept for the year ensuing, in the middle of the town, and that all such as live more than two miles, or thereabout, shall be so far eased as to embody amongst themselves, and upon their employing either a master or school-dame, shall draw the whole of what they pay to the school rate in said town.\" This report was accepted, and ordered to be recorded. May 18, 1748, the town voted, that the grammar school should be kept in four places and no more, and those who live two miles from the school may have the privilege as in 1745. The selectmen to appoint the four places. In 1748, the town was again indicted for not having a grammar school, and William Lawrence, Esq., was ap pointed agent to defend in the case. For several years, about this period, the school was or dered and managed in the same or a similar manner, as above stated. The sum of money annually expended for the schools, at the above dates, does not appear, as it was voted, raised and assessed among other town charges ; but in 1752, it was separately voted, and the sum for the grammar school, no other being mentioned, and probably there was no other, was forty pounds. In 1755, the sum granted for schools was forty-six pounds thirteen shillings and four pence ; twenty-six pounds thirteen shillings thereof, to be expended in the middle of the town ; the remainder in the \" out skirls.\" In 1758, the sum granted for the grammar school to be kept in the middle of the town, was fifty pounds, and twenty pounds for reading and writing schools in the \" several angles of the town,\" and a committee designated the places and apportioned the money."], [245, "CHILDREN FIRST NUMBERED. 221 The terms \"angles,\" and \"squadrons,\" were, for many years, used for what we now call school districts. The last above recited arrangement for the schools, was observed, with some slight variations, for several years. One quarter part of the time, the grammar school was sometimes kept in the north part of the town, and sometimes in the south. Shirley and Peppered, it will be remembered, had been set off as separate districts in 1753. The sum annually granted for the support of schools rose to seventy-five pounds. In 1760, a school house in the south part of the town was burnt. The following article was inserted in the warrant for March meeting, 1769 : \" To see what allowance the town will make such persons as have or may erect school houses in the several angles of the town, he.\" But nothing was allowed. In 1778, a new arrangement of the schools was made, as appears by the following votes : \" Voted, That the children be numbered through the town ; males unmarried from four years old to twenty one ; females unmarried from four years old to eighteen ; and the whole of the money raised this year for the schools to be equally divided upon the polls.

In 17S5, a committee having been appointed to report on the subject of schools, reported, that the town should raise one hundred pounds ; thirty for the grammar school in the centre, and seventy for the schools in the several angles ; and that there should be two more angles than there had been hitherto. The sum of one huudred pounds was the usual sum raised for the support of schools for several years about this period. In 1790, a committee having been appointed to take a census of the children, males under twenty-one and females under eighteen years of age, reported that there were the numbers following in the several districts desig nated thus : The Centre District, Now Nos. 1 and 14, 139 children.

James Blood and a few others in his neighborhood, were allowed to spend their proportion of the school tax at their own dis cretion. Another part of the report enjoined it upon all the districts to erect school-houses, as soon as might be, at the expense of the town. This division did not long remain undisturbed, for the vote of the town permitted any one to leave his proper district and join any other, without a change of residence. In 1805, a very large and respectable committee made a report on the subject of schools, containing a division of the town into twelve districts, numerically distinguished, their boundaries plainly defined, and a code of judicious by-laws, which were printed for the use of all concerned ; so that for the first time something like order and regu larity was introduced into the system. These by-laws provided, that the children should be annually enumerated in each district, their numbers returned by the respective clerks to the selectmen, who apportioned the money raised among the districts in pro portion to the number of children therein respectively, except that a certain portion was first deducted for the grammar school. The sum annually raised at this time was one thousand dollars. In 1823, No. 10 was divided, making a new district, No. 13 ; and in 1828, No. 14 was made from a part of No. 1. The by-laws remained in force till the statute of 1826, chap. 143, passed, when a revision of them was made to conform to the statute. No material alteration was made"], [248, "224 SCHOLARS AND EXPENDITURE IN 1836-7. in the boundaries of the districts or in other parts thereof, except what was necessary to conform to the law, and one respecting the apportioning of the money raised. Instead of dividing the whole according to the number of scholars, one third part is first divided equally to each dis trict. The number of scholars in the districts being very unequal, some having only about thirty, and others more than a hundred, the present distribution cannot be justi fied either as justice, equity, or good policy. As it is impossible that all the inhabitants can be equally accom modated by the localities of their school-houses, and as some neighborhoods grow more and others less populous, changes cannot be avoided. Already dissatisfaction is expressed, and measures are in train to increase the number of school-houses, already too numerous for pro moting the greatest good at the least expense.

No. 7. The lands were sold for $620, and that sum is vested where it yields six per cent, per annum, and the same is annually expended in supporting a woman's school in said district, which receives its due proportion of the school tax, in addition thereto. The fund is placed under the superintendence of the trustees of Groton Ministerial Fund, and is called \" The Sawtell* School Fund.\" About the year 1796, a number of individuals associated for the purpose of establishing a Social Library. What the number of the associates was, or of the books with which they commenced, is not now known ; but they both must have been very small, for in the year 1810, when they assumed a corporate form under the statute of March 3, 1798, there were less than forty members, and only one hundred and thirty volumes. This association never after received any material increase of members or addi tion to their books. See Note 1, of chapter X. page 211. 29"], [250, "226 SOCIAL LIBRARIES. In the year 1828, a second social library association was formed, and a subscription for the purchase of books made, which amounted to about $185. Of this sum Luther Lawrence, Esq., and his four brothers, though not at the time residents in Groton, contributed about one half. The selection of books for this library was judi cious, embracing more modern publications, and those better adapted to the taste and instruction of readers generally, than those of the first library. The proprietors of the second were mostly proprietors of the first also ; and the natural consequence was, the first was almost entirely neglected, while the second received some considerable addition in members and volumes. Under these circumstances committees were chosen by each association, in 1830, to take measures to unite the two. This was harmoniously effected, the rights and privileges of all to use the books being justly and equitably preserved. In the year 1811, another motion was made to establish a library on a somewhat different foundation. The late Rev. George W. Wells, being then the minister of the first parish, expressed a desire that there might be a library open to all who might usually attend public worship in the first parish, and who should be of sufficient age and capacity to gain instruction by reading. The Ladies' Charitable Society in that parish thereupon proposed to appropriate from their funds the sum of one hundred dollars for the purpose, provided the same sum in addition should be raised and appropriated from other sources. The condition was soon complied with, the money raised, and the books for the library purchased. These are more of a moral, religious and didactic character generally, than those of the United Library ; and much interest is taken in their reading. The management thereof is conducted without the aid or intervention of law, upon a few simple, plain and equitable rules. All persons over the age of"], [251, "227 LIBRARIES AND ATHEN\u00c6UM. fourteen years, usually attending public worship in the parish meeting-house where the library is kept, have free access to it, without fee or payment of any kind. Upon the establishment of the Parish Library, the United Library, in its turn, became neglected, and all interest in its preservation and use ceased. The number of its members, from death, removal, forfeiture by non user, and non-payment of assessments, in 1843, was reduced to twenty-four ; whereupon the survivors voted to sell all old and worn out volumes, broken sets, and other useless books, and to present the proceeds of such sale, together with all the remaining books, consisting of about two hundred and forty volumes, to the parish library ; all which was done, pursuant to the vote. The parish library, with this addition and its increase from subscriptions and donations, now contains about six hundred and forty volumes. Besides this, each religious society in town has a Sab bath school library, adapted to the capacity of the younger portion of the community. Several abortive attempts have at several times been made to establish a Reading-room in Groton, or some as^ sociation for the purpose of receiving and diffusing the common news of the day, knowledge of passing events, improvements in the arts, and the state of literature. One of these, brought forth under seemingly favorable auspices, and christened \" The Groton Athen\u00e6um,\" pro mised a good degree of usefulness, information and enter tainment. But having been born during the antimasonic delusion, that plague seized it in infancy ; it struggled a few months, gasped and died. Its small estate, without legal or equitable administration, passed into the possession of those who innoculated it with the malady that caused its premature death, and its just debtors were either defrauded of their dues or received them from its unfor tunate parent."], [252, "228 ACADEMY ASSOCIATION. After the embarrassments and distresses occasioned by the Revolutionary war had passed ; the federal constitu tion had been adopted ; law and order had taken their legitimate course ; and commerce, agriculture and manu factures had commenced their prosperous career, the pro motion of education, literature and science, awakened a lively interest in the wise, prudent and sagacious portion of the community. Education had indeed always been a prominent object of attention among the people of New England, and neglected only when the calamity of war, destruction of commerce, and financial embarrassments, prevented its hearty encouragement. A number of the people of Groton and the adjoining towns, about the year 1792, formed a voluntary associa tion for the purpose of erecting a suitable building and supporting an Academy, wherein an education superior to what could be attained in the district schools might be acquired, and preparation for college obtained. The regular records of the association, if indeed any were made, have been lost. But from certain letters and papers, now in possession of the treasurer of the Lawrence Academy at Groton, it appears that the association organ ized on the 27th of April, 1792 ; chose trustees and cus tomary officers, and procured a subscription for the purpose of erecting and finishing an Academy building. They denominated a subscription of five pounds currency, the least sum received, a share ; ten pounds, two shares, and so in proportion. The number of shares taken at that meeting, and soon after, as nearly as can be now ascertained, was sixty-five. The names of the sub scribers, number of shares, and amount, are stated in the following list, taken chiefly from authentic documents.

The receipts at this rate, as might well be supposed, were unequal to the necessary expenditures ; and as there was no provision made for the payment of the instructors, except the receipts for tuition, they were long delayed of full payment for their services. The treasurer, having no funds, except the annual payment by the town of Groton of forty dollars on their treasurer's note, gave his note to preceptors Holyoke, Moor and Williams, which were not fully cancelled for several years. Under this state of embarrassment, the trustees made application to the Legislature for a grant of land to aid them in supporting the institution committed to their trust. Their petition was successful, and on the 27th of February, 1797, a grant was made of half a township of unlocated land, in the then district of Maine, equal to 11,520 acres, which being afterwards located, was sold to John Hodgden, of Weare, New Hampshire, at fifty cents per acre. As soon as the proceeds of this sale were received at the treasury, which was by several instalments, the cor poration was relieved of its embarrassments, and a per manent fund for the support of instruction was estab lished. The price of tuition, in 1795, was raised to twenty cents per week. The fund or balance of credit in the treasury, including the town's note of $666 67, if the debts had all been paid, was the sum of $4,519 86, February 25, 1805. The compensation to instructors from 1800, was generally"], [257, "233 PURCHASES AND DONATIONS. three hundred dollars per annum, together with one moiety of the receipts for tuition, for many years succeed ing ; and in 1810, the price of tuition was raised to twenty-five cents per week. By prudent management of the financial concerns of the institution, the fund increased from the sum above mentioued to $8,531 90, in 1826; being an increase of about two hundred dollars per annum. And during this period, the trustees purchased, for the use of the seminary, a set of instruments for land surveying, Hadley's quadrant, and several mathematical books. A preceptress for the instruction of females was first employed in the summers of 1807 and 1808. After several intermediate years, one was again engaged ; and since, a female department has become a permanent regulation.1 From the time of the incorporation of the trustees, to the year 1826, the donations to the Academy were few and inconsiderable. The following votes of the trustees will embrace them. \" January 20, 1795. At a meeting of the trustees of Groton Academy, voted the thanks of the trustees to the Hon. Oliver Prescott, Esq., for the donation which he has made of a folio Greek Lexicon, a quarto Bible, and Blair's Lectures in two volumes ; and to the Hon.

Since 1826, the bequests and be stowments to the seminary have been neither few nor small. The original trustees, who from small beginnings, had by rigid economy and judicious management raised the institution to a respectable standing, having all \" rested from their labors,\" a somewhat different system of policy was introduced, the number of pupils was not uniformly so numerous, and the productive funds rather diminished than increased for the next succeeding ten years. One year, 1835, instruction was entirely suspended. At a meeting of the trustees, June 21, 1836, they voted, \" That it is expedient to purchase a suitable house and other real estate for the use of the Academy and the accommodation of the preceptor.\" And they authorized the committee of finance to make such purchase. The committee thereupon, by purchase and exchange, procured the mansion-house formerly of the Hon. Samuel Dana, situated between the academy building and the common on which the first parish meeting-house stands, for the sum of two thousand dollars. This house became the residence of the instructors of the Academy till the present year, 1847. The first considerable endowment which was received from an individual was from Mrs. Hannah Brazer, widow of James Brazer, Esq., who had been a trustee from 1795 to 1818. By her last will and testament, made in 1825, she bequeathed to the trustees, for the use of the insti tution, the sum of $500, to be paid to them on the death of her brother, Samson Woods, and the same sum on the"], [259, "MRS. BRAZER'S LEGACY. 235 death of each of her four sisters respectively ; and also made the trustees residuary legatees of one moiety of her estate, specific legacies, debts and charges being first paid. The testatrix dying soon after the making of her will, and her brother Samson having previously died, her executors paid to the trustees, as residuary legatees, two hundred dollars, aud the five hundred dollars payable on the death of Samson Woods. Two of the sisters have since died, and one thousand dollars thereupon paid into the treasury. The action of the trustees, upon this generous legacy, appears by the following report of a committee accepted and recorded, viz. : \" The committee appointed by the Board of Trustees, at their annual meeting, August, 1S26, to prepare some suitable notice of a communication of the executors of the will of the late Mrs. Hannah Brazer, informing them that she had bequeathed to this institution a moiety 2 of the remaining estate, after the payment of specified legacies, respectfully report \u2014 \" That this Board feel sensibly their obligation for the benevolent bequest of the late Mrs. Hannah Brazer to this institution, as expressed in her last will ; and it adds much to their gratification to know, that this bequest accords with the known and expressed wish of her hus band and our associate, James Brazer, Esq. \"James P.

And subsequently, from the same benevo lent gentleman, an elegant illustrated copy of Wilkes's Exploring Expedition, in five volumes, with an atlas. Also, two eight-day clocks, one for the upper and the other for the lower room, in the Academy.\" Whereupon, the thanks of the trustees were once more extended to Mr. Lawrence. At the same meeting of the trustees, a committee was chosen to petition the General Court, to change the name of the corporation to \" The Lawrence Academy at Gkoton.\" At the succeeding session of the Legislature, the petition was preferred and granted. In July, 1846, Amos Lawrence, Esq., whose name has already been more than once used as that of a beneficent patron of the institution, purchased the Brazer estate, so called, being the mansion of the late James Brazer, Esq., and adjoining the Academy lot, for the sum of $4,400 ; and soon after conveyed the same by deed, to the trustees of the Lawrence Academy at Groton. This conveyance"], [264, "240 brazer estate given. is made upon the following considerations, expressed in the deed. \" Born and educated in Groton, deeply inter ested in the welfare of that town, and especially of the Lawrence Academy established in it by my honored father and his worthy associates, and grateful for the benefits, which his and their descendants have derived from that institution, I am anxious to promote its future prosperity ; trusting that those charged with the care and superintendence of it, will ever strive zealously and faith fully to maintain it as a nursery of piety and sound learn ing. Therefore, know ye, that the said Amos Lawrence, in consideration of the premises, and of one dollar,\" &c. He also requested the trustees to have all the buildings and fences upon this estate, put in a state of complete repair at his expense. This request has been complied with, at an expense of more than $1,200. In August, 1846, the trustees received a letter from William Lawrence, Esq., the liberal donor of the ten thousand dollars, before mentioned, in which he proposed to appropriate five thousand dollars to be expended by them for the following purposes, viz. 1. To enlarge the Academy building. 2. To erect a substantial stone and iron fence on the front of the Academy grounds, including the Dana and Brazer estates. 3. To purchase a suitable bell for the institution. 4. The remainder of the sum, if any, to be added to the general fund. With this generous appropriation, the trustees have enlarged the building to nearly double its former size, being now seventy feet in length ; erected a handsome and durable fence, of beautiful Fitchburg granite and cast iron, three hundred and forty feet in length, in front of the buildings ; purchased a bell of five hundred pounds weight ; levelled and smoothed the whole surface of the grounds, and made suitable partition fences."], [265, ""], [266, ""], [267, "241 FUTURE PROSPECTS.

Groton, according to its present limits, is bounded northwesterly by Pepperell, northerly by Dunstable, easterly by Tyngsborough and Westford, southeasterly by Littleton, southerly by Harvard, and southwesterly by Shirley. No part of the boundary lines coincide with the original lines run by Jonathan Danforth, except on Townsend and Tyngsborough. Its shape is very irre gular, and its boundary lines numerous, owing to the many changes made by setting off parcels to the adjacent towns. It contains about 27,350 acres of land, 500 of which are covered by water, rivers, ponds and brooks, and about the same quantity occupied by highways.

Total, twenty-one miles."], [269, "243 SURFACE AND SOIL. is situated north-westerly from Boston, by the commonly travelled road about thirty-five miles. 2 The most prominent feature in the landscape of Groton, viewed from an eminence, is a range of hills scattered through the middle from north to south, partly cultivated and partly covered with their natural growth of forest trees. These hills, with the exception of two or three at the southerly part of the town, are arable to their tops, and having a fertile soil, their mingled shades of green cultivated vegetables and patches of woodland afford a beautiful prospect. There is one peculiarity in the forma tion of these hills worthy of notice. They are almost invariably double or treble, vallies of greater or less depth running between their prominences uniformly from north to south. Such as are contained in the above exception afford abundance of granite suitable for masonry. Four or five of the highest of these hills are from two hundred and fifty to two hundred and seventy-five feet above the waters of the Nashua. The descent from them to the river westerly, being from one to two miles, is undulating, gradual, and affording some of the richest and most pro ductive land in the country. The descent eastwardly is composed of gravelly knolls and ridges, swamps, bogs, aud ponds, much inferior in fertility to the western slope. On the west side of the Nashua, between Pepperell and Shirley, is a large swell rising to the same height as the highest hills aforementioned. The lands bordering upon Nashua and Squannacook riv ers, are narrow strips of intervale and more extensive sandy plains ; the former being suitable for the cultivation of Indian corn, potatoes and grass, the latter for rye. So that the whole town affords all the varieties of soil common m the country, from the richest and most productive to the poor est and most barren ; the good land, however, predominates. 5 The exact course and distance from the first parish meeting-house to the State-house, according to the late trigonometrical survey of the Common wealth, is, S. 56\u00b0 34' 20\" ; E. 163037.8 = 30 miles 281 rods 1.3 feet."], [270, "244 SQ.UANNAC00K RIVER \u2014 JAMEs's BROOK. By an inspection of the map it will be seen that Groton is abundantly supplied with water. First, the Nashua, formerly called Lancaster river, runs through the town nearly in the middle, as it existed before its division, from south to north, bearing a little easterly, and now forming parts of the divisional lines between Groton and Shirley and Pepperell, and having one school district of Groton on its west side, between Shirley and Pepperell. The falls in this river, where within or bounding on Groton, sufficient for mill privileges, are but two ; Stoney-wading place, where the great county road crosses, and Babbi tassett. The former is occupied by a saw-mill, grist-mill, shingle-mill, paper-mill, and carding factory. The latter is occupied on the west side in Pepperell. Squannacook river, the next stream in size, forms the present boundary line between Groton and Shirley, from Townsend line to its mouth at the Nashua. This affords several sites for mills, three of which are now occupied for sawing, grinding, and the manufacture of paper. James's brook, formerly the outlet of Martin's pond,3 now receiving its waters from Half-moon and Broad meadows only, first takes a southerly course from the middle of the town, then westerly into the Nashua, near the mouth of the Squannacook. On this brook once stood a mill, on the land now of Benjamin Moors. The name was unquestionably given to it from James Parker, who lived near it in the centre of Groton. Sandy brook, in the south part of the town, takes its 3 In a warrant for town meeting, September 17, 1798, is the following arti cle: \"Art. S.

At the present outlet there is an ap pearance of a channel dug through a small ridge of land; and this channel has been lately widened and deepened, so that the pond is much contracted, and the surface of the water much lower than formerly."], [271, "245 SEVERAL BROOKS. rise from Long pond, runs into Sandy pond, and thence south-westerly, meeting the brook from Harvard, on which stood Jonas Prescott's \" old mill,\" nearly two cen turies ago, and thence, under the name of Nonacauicus, Cauicors or Cauicus, into the Nashua, near the crossing of the Fitchburg railroad. On this brook stands C. Fletcher's saw-mill, and a grist-mill formerly stood at the Fitchburg railroad crossing, but has of late been discontinued. The brook now issuing from Martin's pond, takes a southeasterly course, meeting another of about the same size at school-house No. 9, arising from meadows and springs near the middle of the town, runs into Cowpond meadows, where it meets another from Indian meadow and other low grounds in school district No. 10, and also the outlet of Knap's pond, and falls into Whitney's pond. Lathrop's mill is on this stream just above its entrance into the pond. A short brook from Baddacook or Batta cook pond also falls into Whitney's pond. On this stands a grist-mill known as Wood's mill. The brook issuing from Whitney's pond is called Cowpond brook ; it empties into Massapoag pond on the confines of Dunstable and Tyngsborough. A small stream formed from hills on the northerly and easterly sides of Chestnut hills, called Walnut-run, flows easterly, and meeting with another branch called Haw-tree brook, passes through Scull-mea dow, and forms Unquetenassett, or Uncutenorsett as it is sometimes written, which runs northerly through that part of Dunstable formerly Groton, into Nashua river. The situation of the several ponds, and their relative sizes, may be better learned by looking on the map, than by any description that can easily be given of them. The names of the principal are, Sandy, Long, Knap's, Duck, which has neither inlet nor outlet, Whitney's, Baddacook or Battacook, and Martin's. Three more, part only in Groton, are Spectacle, Forge and Massapoag. This last merits a more particular notice. Danforth, who surveyed"], [272, "246 MASSAPOAG POND. and laid out the plantation in 1668, represents it \" full of small islands.\" Its area was then equal to a square mile or more. Its outlet was on the easterly side, and as it was the reservoir into which Cowpond brook poured its waters, a considerable mill-stream issued from it. The waters passed without any rapids for a considerable dis tance, affording no favorable site for a mill. The north end of the pond was bounded by a ridge of loose sand, rising but little above the surface of the water, and being about six rods only in width ; on the opposite side of which was a descent of about forty feet. Here then, was an eligible spot for an overshot mill. At a town meeting held May 21, 1688, a grant was made to Samuel Adams of a small pond near Buck meadow, and leave given to drain it by a brook running into \" Tyng's cove.\" At the same meeting, for the encouragement of any who would set up iron-works at Massapoag, a grant was offered of the wood on the easterly side of Unquetenassett brook. It is said, that Adams, who is supposed to have accepted the grant, erected a grist-mill at the site abovementioned, con ducting the water across the sand-bank to the flume of his mill. At the time of a flood about the year 1700, (the precise time is not known,) a breach was made across the sand-bank, and it being very loose and moveable, the whole bank was soon torn down by the water to the depth of more than thirty feet : and consequently a sheet of water of that depth, where the pond was so deep, and where of less depth the whole water upon the surface, flowed sud denly off (all in one night,) with irresistible violence.4 The mill of course was demolished, and the stones, though diligently sought for, and even the skill of the famous Moll Pitcher, of Lynn, employed in the search, have never yet been found. The bottom of the pond being uneven, 4 It is said that Mr. Adams was not at home at the time of the accident; that his negro servant saw the first rent made by the water, and afterwards said, he could have stopped it with his hat full of sand, but having a grudge against his master he permitted the process to go on."], [273, ""], [274, ""], [275, "247 SOAP STONE AND IRON ORE. fish in abundance were left in the cavities, which were easily taken, and the inhabitants of the neighboring towns, as well as of Groton, came and carried off loads of them. Where the water formerly issued from the pond, a small brook now runs in, and the outlet is, at the place of disruption, called the \"gulf.\" The water finds its way into the old channel, two or three miles from the pond, in a north-westerly direction from Dunstable meet ing-house. The land left bare by this accident is now mostly woodland, on which are oaks and pines two and a half feet in diameter. The prevailing growth is white pine. Some part is cultivated and some is pasture. The artificial prospect of Groton is not inferior in its kind to the natural landscape. A view from the hills on the east side of the street, on a pleasant summer's morn ing, or from Farmers' row, when the sun is declining in the west, having in sight the whole street, three-fourths of a mile in length, handsomely studded with neat and well painted dwellings, the Lawrence Academy and three churches, with stately spires pointing heavenward, is not exceeded in beauty by any country village in the Com monwealth. In the mineral kingdom, Groton cannot be said to be rich. Granite of good quality abounds in the hills in the south part, and occasional boulders are found in most parts of the town, which can be advantageously used. A quarry of soap-stone is wrought to considerable extent, situated about one mile and a quarter northerly from the village. Iron ore is found in several parts of the town, but especially in the north part, and was formerly used by a company formed for the purpose of manufacturing it ; but the quality proved to be bad, and except for castings it has not of late been used. At Massapoag pond, there are chalybeate springs, both on the eastern and western shores, issuing from the banks near the present surface of the water. Houses have been erected on both sides of the"], [276, "248 SOIL AND PRODUCTIONS. pond, near the springs, for the accommodation of pleasure parties and occasional visitors, rather than for invalids. Peat or bog meadows, of greater or less extent, are found in all parts of the town. Two of the largest, one situated on the south-westerly side of the village, and the other on the north-easterly side, containing, perhaps, one hundred acres each, are in a state of successful cultivation, as are also some others in different parts of the town. Portions of these meadows were indispensable to every first settler's farm, as the principal or only resource for food for his cattle. They were, consequently, highly estimated, and divided out to the settlers in almost innu merable small lots ; and it is believed, that in the assess ment of taxes, these meadows were rated higher than any land of the same quantity.5 For the last century they have much depreciated in value, and have become entirely useless as mowing ground, being overgrown with weeds, bushes, brush-wood and in some instances large trees. Draining and cultivation are now necessary to render them productive. Groton has all varieties of soil, from the richest and most productive, to very poor and barren. A portion, of about nine square miles in and about the centre, is not exceeded in fertility and feasibility in cultivation by any in the Commonwealth. There are many detached farms in other parts of the town, having good land and poorer intermixed, but this tract is wholly and entirely capable of the highest state of cultivation, richly recompensing the cultivator with abundant crops. The productions are principally Indian corn, barley, oats, potatoes and rye, but hay is the chief article for the market. Hops were for merly grown in great abundance, but the uncertainty of their price, more than the failure of having good crops, has discouraged the growers. 5 On a loose leaf in the Indian roll, it is said there were more than seven hundred acres of taxable meadow in the town. This was about the year 1680."], [277, "249 POST-OFFICE. The best varieties of apples, pears, peaches, cherries, plums, &c, are more sought for and cultivated than for merly ; and a surplus of them are carried to the Lowell market. The natural growths of the forest are chestnut, the common varieties of the oak and pine, walnut, maple and birch. The chestnut aud shagbark walnut are sources of profit on many of the farms. September 29, 1800, a Post-office was established in Groton, and the Hon. Samuel Dana was appointed and commissioned the Postmaster. No mail, however, was delivered at the office until the last week in November following. For the first year, or part thereof, the mail from Boston was brought to this office by way of Leominster. This appears by a letter from the Postmaster General to the Postmaster at Groton, dated December 18, 1800, appa rently in answer to a request to have the mail brought direct from Boston. In this letter the Postmaster General says, \"It appears to me, that the arrangement which has been made for carrying the mail to Groton is sufficient for the accommodation of the inhabitants, as it gives them the opportunity of receiving their letters regularly, and with dispatch, once a week. The route from Boston, by Leominster, to Groton, is only twenty miles farther than by the direct route, and the delay of half a day, which is occasioned thereby, is not of much conse quence to the inhabitants of Groton. If it should prove that Groton produces as much postage as Lancaster and Leominster, the new contract for carrying the mail, which is to be in operation on the first of October next, will be made by Concord and Groton to Walpole, and a branch from Concord to Marlborough. \" I am respectfully, Sir, your obedient servant, Jas. Habersham.\" 32"], [278, "250 POSTMASTER AND REVENUE. What faith would James Habersham then have had in a prediction, that in less than half a century, accommoda tions not only for conveying a mail, but for an unlimited number of passengers and weight of freight, three times every day, each way between Boston and Groton, would be in operation ? The amount of postage, after deducting the Post master's percentage and necessary expenses, for the first year after the establishment of the office, was about twelve dollars, or three dollars per quarter. In the year 1802, it was thirty-six dollars, or nine dollars per quarter. During that year, the mail was conveyed once a week only, to and from Boston by stage. In July, 1804, Judge Dana resigned the office, and the Hon. William M. Richardson, since Chief Justice of the Superior Court of New Hampshire, was appointed in his stead. In January, 1812, Judge Richardson resigned, and Abraham Moore, Esq., was appointed. During Judge Richardson's term of office, the net revenue to the department rose from nine dollars to about twenty-eight dollars per quarter. August 14, 1815, A. Moore, Esq. resigned, and Mr. Eliphalet Wheeler was appointed. But as there was some misunderstanding respecting Mr. Wheeler's political creed, he was not commissioned, as was supposed, on that account, and on the twenty-ninth of January, following, James Lewis, Esq., who was orthodox in that respect, was appointed and commissioned Postmaster. The average revenue, during Mr. Moore's term of office, was about thirty-three dollars per quarter. July 1, 1826, Caleb Butler, who had been assistant in the office, and performed most of the duties for eight years, was appointed and commissioned Postmaster. During Mr. Lewis's term of office, the revenue rose to fifty dollars per quarter."], [279, "251 POSTMASTER AND REVENUE. C. Butler, Esq., was removed iu January, 1839, and Mr. Henry Woods was appointed in his stead. During this term of C. Butler's office, the revenue rose from fifty dollars to more than one hundred and ten dol lars per quarter. Mr. Woods, dying in January, 1841, Mr. George S. Boutwell was appointed and commissioned his successor. But, upon the change in the administration of the general government, C. Butler was reinstated in office, May, 1841. January 1, 1847, C. Butler, being again removed for political heresy, as was supposed, no cause being assigned, to his knowledge, for the removal, Capt. Welcome La throp, whose political creed was of the right stamp, was appointed Postmaster. During the last term of C. Butler's office, a material change was made in the rate of the postage of letters. The experiment of a cheap rate was put upon trial. From May 14, 1841, to December 31, 1844, the net revenue averaged one hundred and twenty-four dollars and seventy-one cents per quarter. Under the new law, for the first year and a half, the revenue has been one hundred and four dollars and seventy-seven cents per quarter. Had the former rates remained, the natural increase of business should have raised it to one hundred and fifty dollars per quarter. The department, which for some years before had fallen short of supporting itself, now became a heavy charge upon the treasury. Whether the present rates will eventually raise a sufficient revenue to meet the expenditures, remains to be seen. The greatest difficulty to be overcome is, evasion of the post office laws, and frauds upon the department.

This is situated in the north part of the principal village, near the site of the second meeting-house, (and perhaps of the first,) which was built in the town. Its shape is nearly a right angled parallelogram, about thirty-two by fifteen rods, and, of course, contains three acres. Tombs have been erected, within a few years past, along the whole of the north side and part of the east end. It is supposed that the first settlers buried their dead in this place, though there is no monument bearing an inscription, to tell whose dust lies there, earlier than that of James Pres cott, 1704. This is an unwrought flat stone, the name, age and time of death indented with a common pick. Compared with the numbers, whose remains lie buried here, elegant monuments, or even \" frail memorials,\" \" with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture decked,\" are few. Some of white marble, and decent workmanship, stand here and there, and others of slate, interspersed with more ordinary ones, bearing only the names, births and deaths of those whose dust lies beneath them. A handsome pyramid of granite has been erected over the family tomb of the late Samuel Lawrence, Esq. In the present year, 1847, April 10th, an association was formed and organized, according to law, for the pur pose of providing, preparing and embellishing a lot of ground for a rural cemetery. They have purchased twelve acres of land for the purpose, situated about one mile northerly of the first parish meeting-house, on the south-easterly side of the Dunstable road, enclosed it with a plain, substantial fence, and planted more than two thousand trees and shrubs upon it."], [282, "254 THAUMATURGIA.

The site is favorable for the purpose intended. It has a moderate elevation, commanding a very extensive and variegated western prospect. Should the contemplated improve ments and embellishments be successfully and tastefully made, the respect thereby paid to the memory of the dead may redound to the honor of the living. The reverend and learned Cotton Mather, D. D. and F. R. S., in his great work called his Magnolia, entitles Book VI. Thaumaturgus, i. e. Liber Memorabilium, or Book of Wonders ; and the seventh chapter of that book he calls, Thaumatographia Pneumatica, or, A Relation of the Wonderful Works of Spirits. In this chapter he gives various accounts of persons bewitched, houses haunted at sundry times and places, embracing the more general workings of Satan at Andover, Danvers and Salem, in the year 1691. Of fourteen examples, which he says are \"miranda sed credenda,\" strange but true, one has its locality in Groton, viz. \" The Second Example.\" \" In the town of Groton, one Elizabeth Knap, (October, 1671,) was taken after a very strange manner; sometimes weeping, sometimes laughing, sometimes roaring, with violent agitations, crying out money ! money ! Her tongue would be for many hours together drawn like a semicircle up to the roof of her mouth, so that no fingers applied to it could remove it. Six men were scarce able to hold her in some of her fits, but she would skip about the house, yelling and howling and looking hideously. \" On December seventeenth, her tongue being drawn out of her mouth to an extraordinary length, a d\u00e6mon began manifestly to speak in her, for many words were"], [283, "ELIZABETH KNAP. 255 distinctly uttered, wherein are the labial letters, without any motion of the lips at all ; words, also, were uttered from her throat, sometimes when her mouth was wholly shut, and sometimes words were uttered when her mouth was wide open, but no organs of speech used therein. The chief things that the d\u00e6mon spoke, were horrid railings against the godly minister of the town ; but like wise he sometimes belched out most nefarious blas phemies against the God of heaven. And one thing about this young woman was yet more particularly remarkable ; she cried out in her fits, that a certain woman in the neighborhood appeared unto her, and was the only cause of her affliction. \" The woman thus cried out upon was doubtless a holy, a devout, a virtuous person; and she, by the advice of her friends, visited the afflicted.

After this, there was no further complaint of such an one's apparition, but she said some devil, in the shape of divers, did very diversely and cruelly torment her, and then told her it was not he but they, that were her tormentors.\"6 Among other annoyances endured by the early settlers of the town, the ravages of beasts and birds of prey were 6 Had the Rev. and learned Cotton Mather lived a century and a half later, Groton would have furnished him with several more examples of"], [284, "256 MAGICAL RODS. not the least, as the votes of the town granting bounties for killing these marauders, and the sums drawn from the Tliaumaturgiu, which he might have given with the same asseveration, \" miranda scd crcdcnda,\" as he did to the fourteen mentioned in the text. For instance he might have related \" The Fifteeeth Example.\" \" It fell out at Groton that an untenanted house, belonging to one Jason Williams, was taken possession of by a d\u00e6mon or d\u00e6mons, and divers hideous noises were heard therein by sundry credible persons, who often repaired thither of a pleasant evening, to hear them. The said noises much resembled the fluttering of bats or swallows in some old hollow tree or chimney ; yet nothing was visible; and those who had designed to inhabit there were so affrighted, that they were fain to relinquish their intentions; to the great damage of the owner and disturbance of the neighborhood.\" \" The Sixteenth Example.\" \"The devil, for some unknown, but undoubtedly selfish and wicked purpose, did so endue certain persons, of whom one Nathaniel Sartell was one, with miraculous gifts and faculties, by which they were enabled to show exactly where were veins and springs of water, and where lay ores of silver and other precious metals and hidden treasures, though all far beneath the ground, and not discernible to other persons. These wonders they were wont to perform by means of rods of steel or witch-hazel, cunningly wound about with cords and prepared by diabolical incantations. And it was very remarkable, that when these gifted persons were hired by good honest people, to show them where to dig wells with an assurance of finding water, they would point out the most convenient spots for those who hired them, where in truth they could find water, though sometimes they were necessi tated to dig very deep for it. And they would also show unfrequented dismal places where ores of gold and silver abounded ; but then it was so deep in the bowels of the earth, that none could be come at, but a few specimens and fragments of no value at all. And then again these magical rods, in the hands of persons who possessed the skill and faculty to use them, would point out the deposits of pots and chests of ready coined gold and silver, hidden by Capt. Kidd and other pirates, of which the devil has the special care. But when even the most devout, pious and godly Christians, with the Bible, Prayer-book, and Pilgrim's Progress lying near them, to keep off\" infernal spirits, had dug down to within an inch or two of the treasures, a d\u00e6mon, in shape of some huge monster, with hideous yawning mouth and enormous white teeth ; or of some ugly night bird, with eyes as big as saucers, would appear, as if on purpose to mock them, and hinder them from adding wealth to their wisdom ; and upon the slightest word or whisper from one of the party, the chest, almost within their grasp, would move off with a rumbling noise, to some distant and less attainable spot."], [285, "257 BOUNTY ON WOLVES. treasury, in consequence thereof, plainly show. As a sample of the votes at various times passed, take the following, May 22, 1749 : \" Voted, That the sum of forty shillings be paid out of the town treasury, to any of the inhabitants or any other person, that shall kill any grown wolf within the town of Groton, within one year, or take the track in said town and follow the same and kill it where they will ; and the neighboring town, that will join with us, and pay to any Under such discouragements some began to think the handlers of these rods were imposed on by the devil, and were no better than conjurors and impostors.\" \"The Seventeenth Example.\" \" In the year 1797, divers persons, to outward appearance as harmless, as honest, and as godly as their neighbors, were accustomed to meet statedly, and shut themselves up in secret conclave for hours together, admitting no one, except of their own crew, to see or know what was transacted by them. And although some of the wiser sort entertained suspicions, that their assemblages were no better than those of witches, warlocks and d\u00e6mons, with Beelzebub to preside ; and although, at sundry times, superhuman noises and sulphurous fumes proceeded from the den where they met, yet these nefarious meetings were suffered to be held for more than a score of years, and their horrid machinations to spread and ripen, till both church and state came near being swallowed up in utter ruin by them. At length, it being supposed that sundry horrid murders had been committed by them, and it becoming manifest that they were all, like Dr. Faustus, leagued with the devil, under tremendous and nefarious oaths and imprecations, to take away the rights, liberties, and privileges of the people, a geneial alarm was raised, the plots and conspiracies were exposed, and the people were mar vellously enlightened concerning their perilous condition. Whereupon all who were known to have been present at those midnight orgies, or had made league with any d\u00e6mon, (except a few who voluntarily came forward and humbly confessed their guilt,) were treated as common enemies ; no aid or comfort was afforded to them, and they were deprived of all places of profit and honor both in church and state ; and the discoverers and exposers of these abominable and treasonable deeds, were promoted to supply their places, in gratitude for their meritorious services. And so it came to pass, that not only Groton, but the whole country, was wonderfully \u2014 nay, miracu lously delivered from the bondage, slavery and dominion of Satan, to which these miscreants would fain have surrendered it ; and all this was accom plished without a single punishment, (which they so richly merited,) by the hand of the public executioner.\" 33"], [286, "258 COMBINATION OF TOWNS TO KILL WOLVES. of our inhabitants in the following manner, that is to say, the town of Westford twenty shillings, the town of Littleton twenty-two shillings and sixpence, the town of Dunstable ten shillings ; then the town of Groton to pay to any of the inhabitants of the aforesaid towns the sum of forty shillings in the same manner as abovesaid ; and if the town of Harvard comes into the same method, and pays twenty shillings, Lunenburg twenty-five shillings, Townsend ten shillings, and Hollis ten shillings, to any of our inhabitants that shall kill any grown wolf, as aforesaid, then any of their inhabitants shall receive of the town of Groton the sum of forty shillings, as afore said ; and such and so many of the said towns that shall join, shall be entitled to the forty shillings, as aforesaid, provided said wolf be killed within one year, and within the bounds of any of these towns that shall join and pay as aforesaid, or take the track in any of the abovesaid towns, and follow the same until they shall kill said wolf; and the head of any wolf killed as aforesaid, and brought to the selectmen of either of the abovesaid towns that shall join as aforesaid, or to the major part of them, and the ears of the said wolf cut off by one of the constables in their presence, and the major part of the selectmen belonging to the town in which the wolf be killed, certi fying the same under their hands, shall be sufficient to entitle the person that shall kill the wolf, as aforesaid, to the aforesaid sum.\" The bounty for killing crows has, with some inter mission, been continued till within a few years. During the revolutionary war such was the scarcity of hard money, and the difficulty of collecting taxes, that no suitable person would willingly accept the office of constable and collector, the duties of which were united. Many, who were chosen- to the office, paid their fines, rather than perform the duties ; and it seems probable, that men unable to pay a fine were sometimes chosen to the"], [287, "259 FINES PAID BULLETS RUN. office with the expectation that they would so pay. In 1777, Amos Ames paid a fine. In 1778, Joseph Allen, Nathan Ames and Caleb Blood, paid fines. In 1779, Na thaniel Stone, David Green and Jacob Gragg, Jr., did the same. In 1780, Robert Ames ; and in 1782, Asahel Wy man, Ebenezer Procter, Enoch Cook and James Blood, Jr., all paid fines ; and Jonas Stone in that year consented to serve, on condition of receiving the fines of Cook and Wyman ; and Daniel Woods did the same for the fine paid by Procter. What the real value of these were, under the depreciated state of the currency, is difficult to tell. The nominal sum which Robert Ames paid in 1780, was eighty pounds. Another small source of revenue in these difficult times was, fines imposed for profane swearing, and non-attend ance on public worship. In 1779, Israel Hobart, Esq., is credited for two pounds eight shillings, being a fine by him received for the former offence ; and Gabriel Lakin paid thirty shillings for the latter offence. At the annual town meeting, May, 1777, \u2014 \" Voted, That the selectmen be directed to take the lead weights from the meeting-house windows, and cause them to be run into bullets for the town stock.\" The Court of Common Pleas sat in Groton in May, 1779 and 1780. It was in session in the meeting-house on the remarkable dark day, May 19, 1780, and candles were necessarily used.

Fitch, who lived near Nashua river. \" May 19, 1780. Then it was an exceeding dark day, such as was not known before in North America.\" The darkness of this day and of the night following, which was proportionally great, was satisfactorily ac counted for, by attentive observers of the phenomenon. There had been, a few days previous, very extensive fires between the settlements in Canada and New England. The state of the atmosphere and currents of the wind had favored the collection and preservation of the smoke over the territory involved in the darkness. The forma tion of the clouds, too, which prevailed at the time, probably had an agency in producing the result, by being in several layers and holding the smoke between them, and especially between them and the earth.

At eleven o'clock, the rain somewhat abated, but the wind veering towards the south, blew a tremendous gale. Fences, fruit trees, whole forests, chimnies and whole buildings, were sud denly prostrated, and the earth was strewed with fruits and fragments of all kinds in promiscuous confusion. It extended in great severity along the sea coast from Maine to New York, and inland, from fifty to one hundred miles. The year 1816, was a very cold and very dry season. In April, a very large macula appeared upon the sun, which was succeeded by numerous others, at no time wholly disappearing for several months. From the 6th to the 11th of June, were severe frosts. On the 9th, were squalls of snow. There were also frosts in July and August. September 27th and 28th, the frost is very se vere. Indian corn, being mostly in the milk, is destroyed, so that there is but about an eighth part of a good crop. 1818.

Notices of some of the families of the first settlers, and of distin- guished individuals, arranged in alphabetical order. Bancroft. The ancestor of the families of this name, came very early from England and settled in this country. He is supposed to have brought with him two sons, Thomas and another. The father died at Lynn, in 1637. Thomas settled in that town, and died there, August 19, 1691, aged 69 years, leaving three sons. Thomas, the eldest of these, settled in Reading, west parish, and had eight children. Thomas, the eldest of this family, and third of the name in succession, was representative of the town of Reading at the time of his death. He died November 9, 1731, aged 58 years. He left four sons, the third of whom was Benjamin, the ancestor of the families of the name in Groton, Pepperell and many other places. He lived some time in Charlestown, there married Anna Lawrence, daughter of John Lawrence, of Lexington, and afterward came to Groton, where he pur sued his occupation as a tanner, in the centre of the town. He died at Groton, July 21, 1787, aged 86 years. The number and dates of the births of his children are found in another place. Benjamin, his first son, pursued the occupation of his father in Groton, was a captain in the militia, treasurer of the town, and a deacon of the church."], [292, "264 BANCROFT BARRON. He died at the age of SO years. Edmund, his second son, removed to that part of Groton which is now Pep perell, was a husbandman, represented the town of Pep perell in the General Court, was a captain of the mil.tia, and treasurer of the town for twenty years. William Bancroft, a son of Deacon Benjamin, served several years iu the war of the Revolution, was a lieuten ant, and received a pension as such, the latter part of his life. Edmund Bancroft, eldest son of Edmund of Pepperell, was a lieutenant in the Revolutionary war, and died of the small pox at Prospect hill. Col. Jonathan Bancroft, another son of Edmund, served seven years in the Rev olutionary war, and is still living. Dr. Amos Bancroft, another son of Edmund, graduated at Harvard College in 1791 ; studied medicine under Dr. O. Prescott, Sen., of Groton ; practised in that profession at Weston ; removed to Groton in 1811, where he still lives. He has been many years a counsellor in the Mas sachusetts Medical Society. The other branches of this family are numerous, scat tered in various parts of the country, containing many men of worth and distinction. Barron. Two of the first settlers of Groton bore this name. Ellis, the possessor of a fifteen acre right, and John of a seven acre right. They both had children, but none of the name has been known here for a long time. Elias Barron, (perhaps the same name above spelt Ellis,) was one of Capt. Lovell's daring company in the expedition to Pequacket, in 1725, and was lost on his way home. Samuel Barron is gratefully remembered as a charitable donor of a small fund for the relief of the poor of the church."], [293, "265 BLOOD DANA. Blood. This name is very common in this town, and others in its vicinity, and has been so ever since the first settlement. Four of the name are among the original proprietors of Groton, viz., Richard, Robert, James, and Joseph. Richard and Robert are named as petitioners for the plantation, and Richard was one of the first board of selectmen chosen by the inhabitants. He was continued in that office several years, and in 1668 was town clerk. Of all the original proprietors, Richard Blood was the largest. He owned a sixty acre right. The next highest was a fifty acre right. Either by accident or for some cause now unknown, the lands of the Bloods are not recorded in the Indian Roll or in the book transcribed from it by John Morse, in 1683. They are for the first time described by the proprietors' committee, in 1739, and afterwards recorded. Richard lived at the place called \"Nod.\" He was son of James Blood of Concord, and from him probably descended most of the Bloods in Groton and Pepperell. He died at Groton, 7d. 10 mo., 1683, (not 1692, as stated by Farmer.) A large number of families are recorded. They resided in the north part of the town, and many of them were included in Pepperell and Dunstable, in the divisions of the town. Dana. The Rev. Samuel Dana was the settled minister of Groton, from June 3, 1761, to March, 1775. A notice of him is given in the chapter on ministers, &c. His eldest son, Luther, was an active, enterprising man, engaged in navigation, being master of the vessel in which he sailed. He was father of the distinguished doctor and chemist, Samuel L. Dana, of Lowell. 34"], [294, "266 DANA The Hon. Samuel Dana, the other son of the minister, read law, and commenced the practice of it at Groton about the year 1789. He was a popular speaker, able advocate, and successful practitioner. Being a cotem porary in practice with Hon. Timothy Bigelow, who is noticed in the Prescott family, and having the same elevated stand in public estimation with him, he was very generally engaged on the opposite side of all trials within the range of their practice, which was very extensive. Their popularity in their profession, fidelity to their clients, and adroitness in the management of cases, were nearly or quite equal, but their manners were different. In argument Mr. Dana was calm, smooth, and persuasive ; Mr. Bigelow energetic, forcible, commanding. Mr. Dana represented the town of Groton in the General Court in the years, 1802, 1803, 1825 and the two next succeeding years. He was senator for Middlesex from 1805 to 1813, and in 1817 ; president of the senate, 1807, 1811, and 1812. He was one of the delegates from Groton, in the convention for altering and amending the State constitution, in 1820-21 ; and a representative in Congress in 1814 and 1815; and finally chief justice of the Circuit Court of Common Pleas from 1811 to 1820. In the latter part of his life there seemed to be a want of fixedness of purpose in Judge Dana's pursuits. About the time of the introduction of merino sheep to this country, he purchased a flock, and also engaged in general agricultural business ; but as it commonly happens with professional men in such cases, he was not very successful. He removed from Groton to Charlestown in 1808, and returned in 1815. He again removed to Charlestown in 1835. He was occasionally subject to undue elevations and depressions of spirit, which caused instability in his undertakings and pursuits. He married Rebecca Barrett, who proved a very amiable and excellent companion and"], [295, "267 FARNSWORTH. wife. She died at Groton, May 11, 1834. He died at Charlestown, November, 1835. Gen. James Dana, of Charlestown, is their youngest son. Farnsworth.1 This name has been very common ever since the first settlement of the town. When the first of the name came to this country, or what was the place of his or their residence, has not been ascertained. A Joseph Farns worth, of Dorchester, was admitted freeman, December 14, 1638; and another of the same name, 1639, whose place of residence is not mentioned. As Joseph has been a favorite name in the Groton families, it is not impro bable that one or the other of these was the ancestor of the Farnsworths at Groton. The first at Groton was Matthias. He was an early settler, an original proprietor, and owned a twenty acre right. His house lot and uplands were situated on both sides of the present travelled road to Harvard, on the south side of James's brook, where Ephraim Sawtell and Alvah Wright now live. It appears by the county records, that he had three children born at Groton, and upon examin ing and comparing Groton records, it is evident that he had other children born probably before he came to Groton, viz., Matthias, Jr., John, Benjamin, and Joseph. If reli ance can be placed on the correct use of Jr. and Sen., Matthias Sen. died between 1681 and 1684. And as the name Matthias is not to be found on the records after 1692, till others of the name came of age, it is presumed that Matthias Jr. died young, not, however, till he had had several children, viz., Joseph, Matthias, Ebenezer, Josiah and perhaps others. Assuming all this to be correct, most of which is evidently so, there is no diffi- 1 Sometimes spelt Farnuth, at others Farmworth, and lastly Farnsworth."], [296, "268 FARNSWORTH FARWELL. culty in tracing the genealogy of the numerous families in Groton, and those who emigrated to various parts of the country, to their original stock, and common ancestor, Matthias. The most distinguished of the name in former times appears to have been John. He was an ensign in the militia, a selectman a number of years, moderator of town meetings very frequently, and representative in the General Court for four or five years. He was also chosen deacon of the church, but not without some opposition, as appears in another place. Amos Farnsworth, son of Amos Farnsworth and Lydia Longley, grandson of Benjamin Farnsworth and Mary Prescott, and great-grandson of Matthias Farnsworth, Sen., was an officer in the war of the revolution ; was in the battle of Bunker Hill and in other places of difficulty and danger. After that war he was a major of artillery in the militia. He received a pension of about one hun dred and thirteen dollars per annum, for his revolutionary services, and died October 29, 1847, \u00e6t. 93. Farwell. This has ever been a prevalent name in the south-east and south part of Groton. Two of the name, Joseph and Thomas, were chosen deacons of the church ; but it does not appear that Thomas ever officiated. Henry, the son of William Farwell, Sen., born July 21, 1724, was a soldier in the French wars, and was captain of one of the companies of minute men in Groton, at the commencement of the revolutionary war. He marched with his company, on the 19th of April, 1775, to Cam bridge ; was in the battle of Bunker Hill, and was severely wounded. A musket ball passed through his body, lodging near the spine, whence it was extracted in the evening after the battle. He engraved, upon the ball"], [297, "269 FARWELL \u2014 GILSON. the figures 1775, and kept it as a precious relic. He was a man of small stature, but very strong and athletic, and of undaunted courage. He died in 1803. Naomi Farwell, daughter of William Farwell, born August 16, 1769, sustained a character somewhat noted, on account of her solitary and unsocial habits and man ners, which gave her the title of hermitess. She lived with her father and mother, while they lived, in a poor small house, about a mile north of the village, and after their decease entirely alone, in the same place. She in herited from her father, of whom she was sole heir, a farm of about eighty acres of good land, upon and at the foot of \" Chestnut Hills,\" a large portion of which had never been stripped of its native forest trees. Of this, after the death of her father, she superintended the man agement, constantly laboring with her own hands, and hiring only in the most busy seasons of the year. It is said by her biographer, \" The seclusion of her abode, her eccentric habits, and the romantic beauty of the walks over her domain, together with her reputation for skill in palmistry, rendered a stroll through Naomi's grounds a favorite promenade for young people.\" By the dreariness of her abode and the severity of winter, she contracted a cold, which brought her to a premature death, January 1, 1838. GlLSON. Joseph Gilson was one of the original proprietors of Groton, owning a nine acre right. One of the same name from Groton was in Lovell's fight, escaped unhurt, and returned home. The name has ever prevailed in the town to the present time. Probably all are descendants from the abovementioned Joseph. They have resided in those parts of the town set off to Pepperell and Dunstable, and northerly and easterly parts as it is at present. They are not known to have been particularly distinguished"], [298, "270 GREEN. from the industrious yeomanry and the common muni cipal and military officers of the town. Green. William Green was an original proprietor, possessing a fourteen acre right. His house lot, containing seventeen acres, lay on both sides of the street or great county road, comprising the present site of the Lawrence Academy on the east side, and the house lots of C. Butler, J. Kilburn, and others, on the west, extending as far north as the road leading across Broad meadow. David Green, a son of Jonathan Green, born March 10, 1741, was in the exact sense of the word, without reserve or qualification, a miser. His father was a blacksmith, and lived in the north part of the town, near where John W. Kemp now lives, on a farm once owned by John Lakin, his maternal great-grandfather. Of his youth and early part of his manhood I am unable to speak with certainty, but have understood that he was averse to labor and extremely parsimonious. He was never married, and seemed to take little or no plea sure in friendship, society, or any of those things which constitute the principal comforts and enjoyments of a great portion of mankind. His father and brothers were all dead before or soon after he became of lawful age. His father had given him a deed of his lands, and he pur chased of his mother and sisters their shares in a deceased brother's estate ; so that he became sole proprietor of all his father once owned, supposed to be a very considerable estate. His methods of accumulating property were, leasing his lands at extravagant rents, and loaning money at usurious interest. What he acquired he preserved by parsimony in his expenditures. His unbounded avarice denied him the plainest wholesome diet, and the coarsest decent clothing. His passion for saving every trifling"], [299, "271 GREEN, THE MISER. article which fell in his way, imbibed and cherished pro bably in youth and confirmed in manhood, reached an extreme in old age. In the leases he made of his paternal mansion-house, he always reserved a room and chamber to himself. These, in the course of his life, he filled with a motley collec tion of various articles of little or no intrinsic value, till they might vie with the cabinet of the most curious anti quarian, or museum of the most whimsical virtuoso. In his excursions about the town, he seldom failed to fill his pockets with scraps of old iron, pieces of leather and cloth, which he chanced to find at the doors of houses and shops. With these materials he would patch his shoes and clothes, till his shoes were as impenetrable as the shield of Achilles, and his garments so patched and parti colored, that it was difficult to know what was their original warp or woof. His household furniture corresponded with his cor poreal appearance. A piece of wood rudely hollowed out with a knife, answered for a spoon ; the leg bone of a lamb or pig, with an old knife blade stuck into it, and another with a fork-tine, were his implements for carving. The trunk of a hollow tree, with a pine board fitted into one end, was his churn ; and the blossom-buds of burdock formed his pillow. He had in his granary, near the close of his life, corn and beans from twelve to twenty years old; and flax grown and dressed about the time of the revolutionary war. His food, when at home, was of the coarsest and sometimes of the most loathsome kind ; and at any of his debtors' or tenants' houses, which he was accustomed to frequent in order to save the expense of board, he refused to eat at table with others, but satisfied his vitiated appetite in solitude, with the crumbs and frag ments which properly belonged to the domestic animals. Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, Sacra fames auri ?\" a"], [300, "272 GREEN, THE MISER. He was not unfrequently involved in law suits, and in some cases lost large sums by having taken usury. When, either from necessity or choice, he attended the court, where he had hundreds or thousands of dollars in dispute, he would carry his food, consisting of cold pud ding and potatoes, in his pocket, on which he would sub sist for several days. Towards the close of his miserable life, he made a deed of his two principal farms, which by bad management had become of small value, except for the large quantity of wood and timber upon them, conveying them to two small boys in Vermont, sons of a relative too remote to be heir at law, and made and executed a will, devising and bequeathing all the rest of his estate to the father of these lads. At a time when he was sick, and thought not likely to recover, his mansion house, being without a tenant, was burnt in the night time, having in all probability been first plundered of its most valuable contents, and his cabinet of curiosities was, by this accident, lost to the world. During his last sickness, three or four villains procured an instrument, purporting to be his last will, to be signed with his name, sealed, and duly witnessed by themselves. After his death, this forged instrument was offered for probate in the county of Hillsborough, New Hampshire, where it was proved, allowed and might have been com pletely and finally carried into execution, but for a dis agreement among those who were to share the property, which led to a discovery of the fraud. Whereupon, an appeal was made to the superior court, the decree of probate reversed, and the genuine will was afterwards established in the probate court in Massachusetts.

William Lakin was probably the oldest man among the first generation of settlers in Groton. From his great age, ninety or ninety-one, when he died, in 1672, it ap pears that he was born about forty years before the first settlement at Plymouth. He is not named among the original proprietors of Groton. By certain old papers, it appears that Lieut. William Lakin and Sarg. John Lakin, were grandsons of William, senior ; that William, junior, father of Lieut. William and Sarg. John, died in England ; that his widow married William Martin, and that the grandfather, daughter-in-law and two grandsons came from Redington, England, to Reading, Massachusetts. The two grandsons had each a twenty acre right, as original proprietors of Groton. William's house lot was on both sides of the road leading to Hawtree-meadow, (probably Chicopee row, or somewhere in that direction,) and John's was at Nod. John also had ninety acres at the \" sledges,\" 8 afterwards the homestead of David Green.

He was an original proprietor, having a twenty acre right, his sons, Nathaniel had a ten acre, and Joseph a five acre right. It is doubtful whether his oldest son, John, resided long at Groton.

He was an ensign in the militia, a deacon in the church, and one of the first representatives of the town under the charter of William and Mary, in 1693. After this, he removed with his family to that part of Cambridge which is now Lexing ton. His son John seems to have gone there before him, as he had a son there in 1688, and his father was at Groton till after 1693. This John Lawrence lived at Lexington, and died there March 12, 1746. leaving a large number of children, of whom Thomas, William and Amos, came to Groton and there lived and died. Thomas was the great-grandfather of Deacon Curtis Lawrence of Groton, and of Hon. Asa F. Lawrence of Pepperell. Col.

On the 22d day of July, 1777, being at home on a fur lough, for the express purpose, he was married to Susanna Parker. While the marriage ceremony was being per formed, the alarm bell rung to call all officers and soldiers to their posts at Cambridge. He immediately obeyed the summons of his country ; but on his arrival at the camp, the Colonel, knowing the circumstances of the case, gave him a furlough for a few days, at the expiration of which, he joined the army at Rhode Island. Having faithfully served in the cause of his country during the term of his engagement, he returned to his native town to enjoy the peace and quiet of domestic life on his farm. He was elected by his townsmen to some of the highest offices in their gift ; he was a deacon of the church, and a justice of the peace, quorum unus. He took a deep interest in providing means for the education of youth ; particularly in establishing and supporting the Seminary in Groton, which now in gratitude to him and his sons bears the family name. Of this institution he was a trustee thirty-three years, and in its benefits and advantages he gave ample opportunities for all his children to participate.

Some of the families in the Appendix may have sprung from him. James's house lot lay on both sides of the principal street near the centre, on the south side of the brook which bears his name, comprising the farm of Dr. Amos Bancroft. Being one of the largest proprietors, and also a purchaser when lands were sold, he had many lots in all parts of the town. James Parker was a very distinguished and extraor dinary man. He was probably a petitioner, as well as a large proprietor and early settler of Groton. He was also a petitioner and proprietor of Dunstable ; and, as is be lieved, of Chelmsford and Billerica. Previous to his settling in Groton, he lived in Woburn, Chelmsford, and probably Reading. He was one of the first board of selectmen, chosen by the inhabitants of Groton in Decem ber, 1662. He is then called Deacon, next year Serjeant, and sometimes afterwards during the remainder of his life, Captain James Parker.

His chirography 5 was peculiar, and very difficult to be read at this day. He was chosen, October 30, 1693, to represent the town in the General Court in November of that year. Capt.

He was a blacksmith by occupation, and was also a builder of mills. He had in his possession, brought from England, a coat of mail, armour,9 and habiliments complete, such as were worn by field officers of that day ; whence it has been supposed, that he or some of his ancestors were warriors, and some one of them might have received the order of knighthood. John Prescott had three sons, John, Jonathan, and Jonas. The last of these only will be noticed in this sketch. Jonas Prescott was born at Lancaster, Massachusetts, June, 1648. He, or his father for him, built the mill in the south part of the town, now within the limits of Harvard, as has been stated in a former chapter; and having purchased a thirty acre right, and bought lands of 8 Of this armour and its owner the following anecdotes are told : \" John was a sturdy, strong man of a stern countenance, and whenever he had any difficulty with the Indians, he would clothe himself with his coat of mail, helmet, cuirass, and gorget, which gave him a fierce and frightful appearance. They having once stolen from him a horse, he put on his armour and pursued them ; and in a short time overtook the party. They were surprised to see him alone, and a chief approached him with uplifted tomahawk. John told him to strike, which he did, and finding the blow made no impression on his cap, he was much astonished, and asked John to let him put it on, and then strike on his head, as he had done on John's. The hel met being too small for the chief's head, the stroke settled it down to his ears, scraping off the skin on both sides of his head. They gave him up his horse, thinking him to be a supernatural being.\" \"At another time, the Indians set fire to his barn. Old John put on his armour, rushed out, drove them off, and let out his cattle and horses from the burning stable.\" \" Again, the Indians set fire to his saw-mill. The old man, armed cap-a-pie, as before, drove them off and extinguished the fire.\" \u2022' Once more, they attacked John's house. He had several muskets in the house, which his wife loaded, and he discharged upon them with fatal effect. The contest continued nearly half an hour, John all the while giving orders, as if to soldiers, so loud the Indians could hear him, to load their muskets, though he had no soldiers but his wife.

He received no devise, legacy, or inheritance from his father, who stated in his will, that he had re ceived his full proportion, in the mill and land at Mona focus, (probably the Indian name of the place where the mill stood,) still called the \"Old Mill,\" in Harvard. He married Mary,11 the only daughter of John Loker, of Sudbury, by whom he had four sons and eight daugh ters. Two of the sons died young ; all the other children married, and were blest with a numerous off spring. The eight daughters, (except Dorothy, who married John Varnum, Esq., of Dracutt,) all married into respectable families in Groton, and having many children, 10 Of one of his purchases there is a record made by himself, when town clerk, consisting of one hundred and one acres, lying \" on both sides of Stoney brook,\" for eighty acres of which he gave three thousand feet of boards, and four pounds in corn and smith-work. 11 A romantic story has come down, by family tradition, to the present generation, of the courtship of this loving pair of fruitful progenitors, and is still preserved with much accuracy, it is presumed, as a nursery tale. John Loker, of whom we have no other account than as connected with this affair, is said to have been wealthy, and he and his wife to have been somewhat aristocratic in their feelings and notions Having only one daughter, and she exceedingly fair and of good promise, they disdained to betroth her to a black smith, the son of a blacksmith, however rich and otherwise unexceptionable he might be. They had set their hearts upon Mary's marrying a lawyer. So when they found that there was a strong attachment between their idol, the fair Mary, and the young blacksmith, they remonstrated, but unwitting pur sued a direct course to foster and strengthen it. They forbade his entering their house, or having any communication whatever with their daughter; and the more effectually to prevent any intercourse, they grated the windows of her apartment in the house; and when they thought there was any danger of an interview between them, they locked her in. Jonas, however, was not to be baffled by grates and locks. He took opportunities, when the cold night wind blew, and the pelting storm raged, when no listener could over hear the soft whispering of true lovers, to place himself beneath her grated window, and there enjoy sweet communion with his dearly-beloved. Their intercourse was soon discovered by the chagrined parents ; and the next expe dient resorted to was to place Mary in some secluded spot, under the care of some watchful and faithful guardian. Chockset, now called Sterling, then a frontier settlement, was chosen as the place of her seclusion. Jonas searched"], [318, "288 PRESCOTT. their posterity soon became a multitude. His house and blacksmith's shop stood between the present residence of the Hon. Stuart J. Park and the brook. Upon the reset tlement of the town, after its destruction by the Indians, he built mills at Forge village, now in Westford, but then in Groton, as has already been stated. He was town clerk in 1691, a selectman several years, a captain of the militia, a justice of the peace, and represented the town in the General Court in 1699, and 1705. He was much employed in business of a public nature, taking a similar station in the community to that of Capt. James Parker before him. He died December 31, 1723, \u00e6t. 75 years. In his will, which in the introductory part is very similar to that of Capt. J. Parker, before recited, he gives his wife the use and improvement of all his real the country around, and made diligent inquiry to find the place of her banish ment, for some time in vain. At length, being one day in the wilds of Chockset, he made his usual inquiry of some young men he saw, if they had any pretty girls in their neighborhood. They told him there was to be a quilting that very day, where all their girls would be ; that they themselves were going in the evening to dance with them, and invited him to be one of the party, where he might see for himself. He cheerfully accepted the invitation; and on arriving at the cottage where the seamstresses of the settlement were assembled, whom should he there find, but his adored Mary Loker. This was indeed a happy adventure. Concealing, as well as they could, their former acquaintance, they took opportunities to be partners in the dance, and made assignments for future meetings. Having thus fortu nately discovered the place of her banishment, he reuewed his visits, till her parents finding it out, took her home. She was then sternly told, that she must reject the blacksmith, and receive the addresses of the lawyer. She resolutely replied, \" she would never marry to any one but Jonas Prescott.\" The rejoinder was, \" Then you shall never have a farthing of our property.\" To this there was a general demurrer; a decree for marriage without dowry followed. The consummation took place before even the most common utensils for housekeeping could be procured ; (some delay might have been made, to see if the old folks would not relent, and provide her some;) the tradition positively asserts, that her only implement for boiling was a two quart kettle, and her wash-tub, the shell of a large pumpkin.

Jonas Prescott, Jr., eldest son of the aforenamed Jonas, born October 26, 1678, lived at Forge village, taking the part of the real estate which his father had owned in that part of the town, and greatly enlarged and improved the works on Stoney brook, by erecting forges for manufac turing iron from the ore, as well as other purposes. In 1730, a part of Groton, including this village, upon the petition of him and others, was set off from Groton to Westford. See Chapter V. He married Thankful Wheeler, of Concord, October 15, 1699, by whom he had two sons and two daughters. His descendants are numerous and respectable, a number of them have received a collegiate education, and prac tised in the learned professions. He succeeded his father in the offices of captain of the militia, justice of the peace, and represented the town in the General Court in 1720. The water privilege and works on Stoney brook at Forge village, have never, since the purchase from An drew, the Indian, been entirely owned by other than Prescotts. Benjamin Prescott, the youngest son of Jonas, Sen., born January 4, 1695-6, married Abigail, the daughter of the Hon. Thomas Oliver of Cambridge, by whom he had three sons and four daughters. He built a house a little easterly of his father's, on the precise spot where the 37"], [320, "290 PRESCOTT. Hon. Stuart J. Park's now stands, where he lived till his death. He was a man of very superior talents, and sustained a character which the best of men might envy. His per sonal appearance is said to have indicated the excellence of his mental endowments, so that a '- stranger might at once perceive that he was no ordinary man. In 1717, he was appointed lieutenant of the first company of foot ; in 1724, a lieutenant of a company of \" snow-shoe men,\" raised to protect the town from Indian invasion ; in 1723, he first represented the town in the General Court, in which station he stood eight years.13 In 1724, he was commissioned a justice of the peace, and afterwards, quorum unus ; in 1732, a lieutenant colonel in a Middlesex and Worcester regiment ; in 1735, a justice of the supe rior court, to try a particular case in the county of Wor cester ; and finally, in 1735, the year of his death, he was chosen agent of the province to the court of Great Britain, which office he declined, on account of not having had the small pox, which disease was prevalent at the time. The Hon. Mr. Q.uincy, chosen in his stead, took the disease and died on his mission. This truly eminent and useful man died in the prime of life, August 3, 1735, of a surfeit, caused by great exer tion to save some hay from a shower.

He moved that it be recommitted, suggesting that the difficulty might thus be removed. A prominent leader in the house rose and said, \" I second that motion, and move that the young gentleman be the committee.\" This was said in derision, but taken in earnest, carried, and soon Mr. Prescott returned a report, which presented the whole subject in so clear a light, that his reputation was at once estab lished, as a man of uncommon good sense and sagacity."], [321, "291 PRESCOTT. whom he could trust was to be had short of Sudbury. His wife survived him twenty-seven years. Three of their daughters died without issue. Elizabeth married Abijah Willard of Lancaster. James Prescott, eldest son of the aforesaid Benjamin, born January 13, 1720-1, married his cousin, Susanna, daughter of Col. William Lawrence, by whom he had six sons and three daughters. He was much engaged during a long life in business of a public nature. In the militia he passed through all the grades of office, from ensign of a company, to colonel of a regiment. Besides being chosen to the most important offices in town affairs, he was chosen representative fourteen years, and afterwards was a member of the senate, and of the executive council many years. At the commencement of the Revolutionary war, he was a member of the Provincial Congress, and of the board of war. He was for some time sheriff of the county of Middlesex, and after the war, a judge of the court of common pleas. He was clerk of the proprietors of Groton for the last fifty years of his life, and was otherwise employed by them in the laying out and division of common lands. This gave him an opportunity to become accurately ac^ quainted with the quality, price and titles of lands, aud by purchase of unsatisfied rights, he became a very large pror prietor. Yet upon the settlement of his estate it was found insolvent. He lived in the house where Capt. Phinehas G. Prescott now lives, and there died, February 15, 1800. His wife survived him nearly six years. William Prescott, the second son of the aforesaid Ben jamin, removed from his birth-place after the death of his father, and while a minor, to that part of his father's estate which is now in Pepperell ; probably the land given by the proprietors for services in procuring the grant of Groton Gore, as has been related in a former chapter. A notice"], [322, "292 PRESCOTT. of him will more properly come in the history of Pep perell. Oliver Prescott, the youngest son of the aforesaid Ben jamin, bom April 27, 1731, married Lydia Baldwin, (of Sudbury,) by whom he had ten children, two of whom died in infancy, and four more unmarried. He was educated at Harvard College, and received his first degree in 1750, and his second in 1753. He was bred a physician ; studied his profession under 14 Dr. Robey, of East Sudbury, (now Wayland,) an eminent physician of that time, settled in his native town, had an extensive practice, and became eminent in his pro fession. He was much employed in municipal and parochial matters, sustaining the office of town clerk thirteen years, and that of selectman thirty-two years, being in that office at his decease. He also stood high as a military character, holding the respective offices of major, lieutenant colonel, colonel and brigadier general, before the Revolution. In 1778, he was appointed third major general of the militia, and in 1781, second major general, but soon after resigned on account of ill health. He was a justice throughout the Commonwealth, a member of the board of war, a member of the council of Massachusetts from 1777, till he declined the office, and in 1779, was appointed judge of probate for the county of Middlesex, which office he retained till his death, giv ing universal satisfaction by the urbanity of his manner, as well as by his impartiality and fidelity in the discharge of the duties of that office.

His wife had died six years previous. Benjamin Prescott, the eldest son of Col. James Pres cott, was killed at the battle of Bunker hill. Abijah, Abel and both Williams, his other sons, died unmarried, as did the first Sarah, his daughter. Susanna, his daughter, married Rev. Daniel Chaplin, of whom a notice is found in another chapter. The second Sarah is still living, unmarried. James Prescott, the youngest son of Col. James, born April 19, 1766, married Hannah, the daughter of the Hon. Ebenezer Champney, by whom he had three sons and seven daughters. All these are dead except Susan, the wife of John Wright, Esq., of Lowell, Lucretia, the wife of Mr. Williams, of Griggsville, Illinois, Lucy, the wife of Dr. Joseph Reynolds, of Gloucester, and Hannah Maria, wife of Charles A. Hamilton, of Worcester. He was educated at Harvard College ; graduated in 1788 ; read law and commenced practice in Westford, where he re mained about ten years, and then returned to his native town. Soon after, upon the death of his uncle, Oliver, he was appointed to his place as judge of probate, and chief justice of the court of common pleas for the county of Middlesex. The last office he held but a short time, the court being remodelled and he not reappointed, on political grounds. One, who well knew him, says, \" He"], [324, "294 PRESCOTT. possessed a strong discriminating mind, was a good classi cal scholar, a learned lawyer, and is entitled to have the credit of having reduced the proceedings in the probate court, to a system more correct than had been adopted, at that time, by any other court in the State. But, unhap pily, he had a harsh temper, which rendered him unpopu lar, and he was removed from the office in 1821. He died October 14, 1829. His wife survived him a few years. Oliver Prescott, Jr., first son of the aforenamed Dr. Oliver, born April 4, 1762, married Nancy, the daughter of Capt. Leonard Whiting, of Hollis, New Hampshire, by whom he had three sons and six daughters. He was pre pared for Harvard College under the tuition of the cele brated Master Moody, at Dummer's school in Byfield, and entered in 1779. He received the degrees of A. B., and A. M., in due course, and studied medicine with his father, and with Dr. Lloyd, of Boston. He settled in his native town, and had an extensive practice in his profes sion in that and other towns in the vicinity. He was appointed surgeon in Gen. Lincoln's army raised to sup press the Shays rebellion, and accompanied the expedition in the severe winter of 1787. In 1813, he was appointed by the Massachusetts Medi cal Society to deliver their annual dissertation. This service he performed with much credit to himself and usefulness to the faculty. His subject was the \" botanical history and medical virtues of serale cornutum.\" This dissertation being published, was soon after republished in Philadelphia and London, and being translated, published also in France and Germany, and inserted in the French dictionary, Des Sciences Medicates, word Ergot. The following year he received the degree of M. T>.,pro honoris causa, at Harvard University. In addition to his eminence as a physician, he was an agriculturalist and civilian. He was a member of the"], [325, "295 PRESCOTT. Massachusetts Agricultural Society, and president of the Western Middlesex Society of Husbandmen. In 1789, he was commissioned a Justice of the Peace, and quorum unus in 1811. He was town clerk and chairman of the selectmen from 1804 to 1811, and represented the town in the General Court in 1809 and 1810. In literary and charitable institutions, also, he was a prominent member, sustaining the highest offices in the several masonic institutions to which he belonged, and being a trustee of Groton Academy from its incorporation, till his removal from Groton, and afterwards of his alma mater, Dummer Academy. In 1811, he with his family removed to Newburyport, in order to pursue his profession in a manner more congenial to his health. His companion both in preparatory studies and in college, says of him, \" His natural parts were good. He had a quick mind, retentive memory, and sound under standing. He loved books, and had improved his mind by a rather extensive, though miscellaneous reading, out of his profession ; in it, he was considered learned and skillful in practice, a better physician than his father, though never so popular. His intentions were always right, and his conduct was open, manly, and upright. In private life he was always a faithful friend.\" September 13, 1821, died his amiable and affectionate consort. He afterwards married Elizabeth, widow of Thomas Oliver, Esq., of Boston. He died at Newbury port, September 26, 1827. Three of his children, two sons and a daughter, died before his decease ; the other six, all well educated and accomplished, still survive, and hold respectable stations in society. Lucy, a daughter of Dr. Oliver Prescott, Sen., married Hon. Timothy Bigelow, son of Col. Timothy Bigelow, of Worcester, who commanded one of the Massachusetts regiments in the revolutionary war.

Timothy Bigelow was born April 30, 1767 ; graduated at Harvard College in 1786 ; read law with Hon. Levi Lincoln, Sen. ; and opened an office in Groton in 1789. He married the abovenamed Lucy Prescott, September, 1791, by whom he had five sons and four daughters. He was eminently successful in the practice of his pro fession, a sound lawyer, and distinguished advocate and counsellor. He was chosen representative of the town in 1793, and in each of the next succeeding thirteen years, except 1803. In 1802, he was chosen one of the exe cutive council, and taken from the house of representatives to fill that station, in which he served two years. In October, 1806, he removed with his family from Groton to Medford, and opened an office for practice in Boston. He represented the town of Medford in General Court, most, if not all the years from his removal there to that of his death. He was senator for Middlesex from 1797 to 1801, and councillor again in 1821. He possessed an admirable talent for presiding in deliberative and other assemblies, and had opportunity to exercise that talent, by being speaker of the house of representatives for eleven years, as well as by presiding in numerous literary and charitable societies, of which he was a member. Law and politics were not the only sciences in which he excelled. He was a great student and general reader. Books in all the liberal arts and sciences were his familiar acquaintances. His conversation in private and social circles of his friends was highly exhilerating, and none ever spent an hour in his presence, on such occasions, without enjoying a rich feast of intellectual entertainment.

He was graduated at Harvard college in 1795, and read law ; but after admission to the bar, he left the profession, owing to a deafness, and engaged in merchandise. In this business he was unfor tunate, owing to the embargo of 1807, the non-inter course, and the war with Great Britain which ensued. He then became an acting magistrate and notary-public for Suffolk county, and now resides in the city of Boston. Mary Jackson, youngest daughter of Dr. O. Prescott, Sen. married first John Little, Esq., by whom she had a daughter, who died in infancy ; and he died about four years after marriage. She afterwards married the Hon. Lathrop Lewis, of Gorham, Maine, by whom she had two daughters and a son. One daughter and the son died young, and the other daughter, after having been twice married, died. She now resides in Gorham. The advantages which the family of Prescotts pos sessed, in wealth, talents corporeal and intellectual, aided by education, and their connection with the most respect able families by their numerous intermarriages, gave them a controlling influence in the moral, social and municipal 38"], [328, "298 SARTELL. affairs of the town. Hence, better regulations, and a more refined state of morals and manners existed in former times in Groton, than in most country towns in the vicinity. Sartell, A family of this name came from England about the beginning of the last century, and settled in Groton. The name of the father of this family was Nathaniel ; and the present Dea. Nathaniel, of Pepperell, is the fifth of that name, in regular descent from him. He lived and died where Eber Woods now lives. He had two sons and two daughters; Nathaniel, Josiah, Sarah, and Mar garet. About the time of his immigration he crossed the ocean several times ; and at one time, February 14, 1718, his vessel and crew were lost in the Bay of Bellisle. He swam, with the cabin boy on his back, to a rock, where he remained during the night ; but the boy was swept off by a wave. In the morning he was rescued, when nearly exhausted. His son Nathaniel resided in Charles town, and was a mariner. He sailed on a voyage the next day after the birth of a son, and was never after heard of. This infant was named Nathaniel, and was the late Lieut. N. Sartell, who lived in the easterly part of Groton. Josiah Sartell, second son of the first Nathaniel, was the munificent donor of three farms and other property to the town and church of Groton, the proceeds of which constitute the greater part of the ministerial fund, as is particularly stated in Chapter X. He married Mary Green, by whom he had two sons and two daughters, all of whom died in their minority.

Inhabitants of this name have resided in Groton ever since its first settlement. Three were original proprietors ; Richard and two of his sons, Jonathan and Zachariah. They came from Watertown. Richard was town clerk the three first years in which records were made. Many of his descendants have sustained offices of trust in the town, church, and militia. Nathaniel was representative in the General Court three years. Some of the name were the first settlers in that part of Groton which now constitutes Shirley. Shattuck. The ancestor of most, if not all, of this name, in New England, is William Shattuck of Watertown. At what time he came to this country is not precisely known. He was at Watertown some time about 1640, and pos sessed a large estate. He died August 14, 1672, and left a numerous family of children, as appears by his will. The first appearance of the name at Groton, is in a mutilated record, of which the following is a copy of what remains legible : \"November 27, 1664.

It does not appear, that he ever came to Groton to reside. He was drowned in crossing Charlestown ferry, September 14, 1675. He left a widow, (whose maiden name was Ruth Whitney, and who afterwards married Enosh Lawrence,) and four children, John, William, Samuel, and Ruth. All these came to Groton, and probably took the \" allotment \" made to the father, which was situated in the north part of the town. Their families (a part of them at least) appear in the Appendix. This last John, and his son John, were killed by the Indians. The next family in the catalogue at Groton is that of William15 and his two wives, Abigail Shattuck and Margaret Lund. By the first he had three sons and two daughters, and by the last, two sons and one daughter. His youngest son is the immediate ancestor of most of the Shattucks in Groton at this time, and is deserving a particular notice. Job Shattuck, born February 11, 1735-6, was some what distinguished as a military character. His first enlistment was at the age of nineteen, in a company of Col.

It is said, that being small of his age, he used a stratagem to appear tall, that he might pass muster. There is no evidence that he performed any service in the French war, other than in this campaign, which was short, but successful. February 25, 1776, he received a captain's commission from the Council of Massachusetts, for a short time only, ending on the first of April following. Under this com mission, he marched with a company of seventy-five men, exclusive of subalterns and musicians, to Boston, about the time that town was evacuated by the British troops. This service lasted only eight days. In 1776, he com manded a company raised in Groton and the neighboring towns, and marched with them to Ticonderoga and Saratoga, and returned in January, 1777. In July, 1779, he received a captain's commission from the Council of Massachusetts, of the second company in the sixth regi ment of Massachusetts militia, which office, it is sup posed, he held till the peace. He was an active and energetic agent in raising recruits for the army, during the revolutionary war. His two oldest sons enlisted and served therein for some time. He was strong and athletic, and an ardent advocate for liberty in its most extensive sense ; but being without education, and the power of discerning the best means to attain and preserve it, he hastily engaged in measures, which, if they proved unsuccessful, must be disastrous to the actors therein, and if successful, destructive to the country. This is exemplified in the part he took in Shays's rebellion, related in another chapter. He first married Sarah Hartwell, by whom he had five sons and four daughters, and afterwards Elizabeth, widow of John Gragg. His five sons all married and had families in Groton. The youngest son, Noah Shattuck, Esq., still survives."], [332, "302 STONE TARBELL. Stone. This has ever been a prevalent name in the south part of Groton. Deacon Simon Stone was an original proprietor, having an eighteen acre right. He was probably the son of Deacon Simon Stone of Watertown. The name does not appear in the records of Groton till the resettlement of the town, after it had been burnt. Simon and John, probably sons of Deacon Simon, were often chosen into town office, and Simon was representative in the year 1706. James, a descendant, was a deacon in the church. Tarbell. This was a rare name among the first settlers in New England. It does not appear in the long list of names of those who took the freeman's oath previous to 1669, nor does Farmer mention any of the name save Thomas, Sen., and Thomas, Jr. In the list of original proprietors, the name of Thomas, Sen., only appears, as an owner of a twenty acre right; but in the laying out of lands, in smaller proportions, they are set to Thomas, Thomas, Jr., and John, the two latter probably purchasers of small rights. The name, Thomas, is so frequent in the different families, that some confusion arises in tracing them all to Thomas, Sen., the original stock, from which they all undoubtedly sprung. One Thomas was town clerk in 1704, and 1705; another from 1731, to 1733, and from 1745, to 1756, inclusively. The first named was probably the father of John and Zachariah, the lads who were captured by the Indians, as related in Chapter VI., and also of William, who mar ried Mary Farnsworth. William was father of another William, who was father of Gen. John Tarbell of Cam bridge. He was also father of John, the father of Asa and Col. Abel Tarbell of Squannacook village.

Wil liam Tarbell, now of Groton, a revolutionary pensioner, is son of Benjamin, who was son of the first named William. The house lot of Thomas Tarbell, Sen., was on the west side of Broadmeadow, not far from the site of school house No. 2. Woods. This is a very common name throughout New Eng land. It is believed that all or nearly all of the name in Groton, Shirley, Pepperell and Dunstable are descendants of Samuel Woods, who owned an eleven acre right, as an original proprietor. His house lot was where the late Hon. James Prescott lived, a little south of the Lawrence Academy, described as lying on both sides of the country or bay road, between the house lots of William Green on the north, and James Fisk on the south. Two of the name from Groton, Thomas and Daniel, were in Lovell's fight, and both were killed. Henry Woods was a major under Col. William Pres cott at the battle of Bunker Hill. He served some time in the war, was promoted to the office of colonel, and after the war, was a general of the militia. He lived in that part of Groton, which upon the incorporation of Pepperell was within that town, and he represented it in the General Court two years. Samson Woods, son of the aforesaid Henry, was waiter to his father at Bunker Hill, and when the Ameri cans were retreating, he loaded himself with the knap sacks of two slain soldiers, and on getting over a rail fence, he being not fifteen years old, and small of his age, the load swung on one side of the rails and his body on the other.

That part of Groton lying west of Nashua river and north of the country road, as travelled a century ago from Groton to Townsend, was set off as a distinct precinct, or parish, in the year 1742, and called \" Groton West Parish.\" At a legal meeting of said parish, held January 17, 1742, at the house of Mr. William Spaulding, Benjamin Swal low was chosen moderator ; Eleazer Gilson, parish clerk ; Benjamin Swallow, Isaac Williams, James Lawrence, Jonathan Woods, and Joseph Whitney, committee ; Sam uel Wright, treasurer ; Jonas Varnum, Moses Woods, and Samuel Shattuck, assessors ; and William Spaulding and Jeremiah Lawrence, collectors. This was undoubtedly the first parish meeting and organization of the parish under the act of the General Court by which it was incor porated. At this meeting, the sum of ten pounds, lawful money, was voted to be assessed to defray the necessary charges arisen and arising in said parish. 39"], [336, "306 WEST PARISH. Whilst this territory remained a parish, nothing of a public nature, unconnected with Groton, except of a paro chial character, was transacted therein. Building a meet ing-house and settling a minister, were of course the first and only matters which called for action, and were put on record. The second meeting was held at the house of James Lawrence, February 16, 1742, at which the parish voted to build a meeting-house, and that it should be set at \" the most convenient place near Joseph Blood's ford way ; \" a well known place, between the paper-mills at Babbitassett and Jewett's bridge. About the same time, it was voted \"to receive the peo ple on the east side of the river, that have petitioned to be annexed to us, provided they will consent to have the meeting-house set at the most convenient place on the west side the river, near the bridge, next below Jo. Blood's ford-way, so called.\" But the momentous affairs of deciding upon a spot on which to set a public building, and choosing and settling a minister, are not usually accomplished without much strife and contention, and are sometimes attended with long and furious quarrels and expensive lawsuits. The reason of this, the Rev. Mr. Emerson, the first minister of the parish, in his sermon at the dedication of the second meeting-house, explains in this manner : \" It hath been observed,\" says he, \" that some of the hottest contentions in this land hath been about settling of ministers and building meeting-houses ; and what is the reason ? The devil is a great enemy to settling ministers and building meeting-houses ; wherefore he sets on his own children to work and make difficulties, and to the utmost of his power stirs up the corruptions of the children of God in some way to oppose or obstruct so good a work.\" If the true reason was assigned by the Rev. Mr. Emer son, it would seem that either the west parish of Groton"], [337, "307 FIRST MEETING-HOUSE. consisted of a large proportion of the devil's children at this time, or that the corruptions of the saints were too easily wrought upon by Satan. Before the expiration of a year, a parish meeting was called, a vote passed to recon sider the vote fixing the place for the meeting-house, and another passed to place it \"three fourths of a mile north east of the centre of the parish, or at the next convenient place.\" The size was fixed at forty-two feet in length, thirty feet in breadth, and twenty feet in height. A com mittee was chosen to ascertain the centre of the parish, and another to state the place for the house. The parish having been surveyed, the centre found, and the northeast line of three fourths of a mile run out, the site for the meeting-house was determined on, which was agreeable to the wishes of a majority of the parish, the north and east parts being more settled upon than the west. Some of the timber for the house was brought to the spot ; but the devil, according to the Rev. Mr. Emerson's theory, was busy setting on his own children, and stirring up the corruptions of others ; the minority, living in the centre and west part, being not well pleased with the location, with Moses Woods at their head, made such resistance to the proceedings of the majority, that the destruction of the parish was threatened. Whereupon the aid of the Great and General Court was invoked ; Peleg Lawrence and Josiah Sartell were appointed a committee to suppli cate the legislature to take measures to end the dispute. The Great and General Court, in mercy to the distracted condition of the parish, appointed a committee to survey the place and locate the meeting-house. The parish chose a committee \" to show the Court's committee the inhabitants of the place.\" It seems that the Court's com mittee promptly attended to the business assigned them, and they agreed upon the spot where the first parish meet ing-house in Pepperell now stands ; and the parish voted, February 19, 1745, \" to set the meeting-house on the"], [338, "308 MEETING-HOUSE FRAME REMOVED. place that the General Court prefixed.\" Upon this final result, the Rev. Mr. Emerson, in the sermon above quoted, remarks : \" One thing I cannot but mention, as a kind interposition of divine Providence, though considered as such by very few in the time, and that is, the fixing the place for the meeting-house, though fixed contrary to the mind and the vote of the majority of the inhabitants by a Court's committee, yet proves now to be with much more equity ; and where all seem to be universally contented with. Had it been erected in the place designed, and where even the timber was drawn to, what trouble, charge and 'tis very likely contention, we must have been exer cised with before this day ! \" The devil having been thus foiled by the Court's com mittee, but not entirely \" cast out,\" made one effort more to obstruct the building of a meeting-house. When the men, employed to remove the timber from the place where it had been deposited to the site determined upon, had assembled for the purpose, and their teams were in readiness to move with it, James Lakin, a leader in the previous minority of the parish, who were rejoiced at the decision of the Court's committee, took the lead with his team. A number of the inhabitants of the east part, greatly enraged at the decision, many of whom bore the name of Shattuck, collected on the spot ; and when the teams were put in motion, they attempted to prevent their forward movement by pricking the noses of the oxen. Lakin, being a stout, strong, athletic man, and probably somewhat excited by the outrage, soon put the whole of them to rout, and let the teams quietly pass on.1 Soon after this the meeting-house was raised, and so far finished as to be occupied in the former part of the year 1745. But, from sundry votes passed, it seems not 1 Fame says the Shattucks, on this occasion, were piled on the road-side \"six or eight deep.\""], [339, "309 MEETING-HOUSE FINISHED. to have been completed, and that occasionally work was done upon it, and improvements made for several suc ceeding years. The following are extracts from the votes about building and completing it. \" Voted, that said committee frame, raise, and board the outside and shingle the roof, lay the under floor and make suitable doors and hang the same.\" \u2014 \" To build the pulpit and the body seats below.\" \u2014 \" To seat the meeting-house.\" \u2014 \" Set off the pews (or pew ground) to the highest payers in the three last rates.\" \u2014 \" To ceil the meeting-house as high as the girths all around.\" \u2014 \"That windows be cut where needed, provided, they that cut them maintain them upon their own cost, that they be no parish charge.\" \u2014 \" To finish the building the seats in the gallery, and to ceil the meeting-house from the gallery floor up to the beams.\" \u2014 \" To glaze the public meeting-house, and to provide boards to lay loose on the floor over-head.\" \u2014 \" To seat the public meeting-house by the three last years' pay.\" \u2014 \" To give the men that are seated on the fore seats below, liberty to set a row of bannisters (balusters) with a rail-stop before the fore seats, at their own cost and charge.\" Judging from these votes, it would seem, that this first house, if it were now before us in its best state, could be called little better than a shantee. But it served for the people of the west parish in Groton, and the district of Pepperell, for about twenty-five years, and no doubt but the praises and prayers therein offered were as sincere and as acceptable to Him, \" who regardeth the heart,\" as those raised in the most magnificent temple ever constructed by human hands."], [340, "310 DISTRICT OF PEPPERELL. April 12, 1753, Groton west parish was made a district by an act of the Great and General Court, in conformity to a petition by the inhabitants, and named Pepperell. This name was adopted in honor of Sir William Pepperell of Piscataqua, who commanded an army of six thousand men raised in New England in the year 1745, for the express purpose of reducing Louisburg and subjecting the isle of Cape Breton to the possession of Great Britain, which was successfully effected. The Rev. Mr. Emerson, who was ordained the minister of Groton west parish about two years after this event, was a chaplain in that expedition, and probably suggested the name in remem brance of his commander.2 It is said that Sir William gave or intended to give a church bell to the district, that he sent to England and had one cast bearing the inscrip tion of his own name and the following couplet : \" I to the church the living call, And to the grave I summon all.\" That the bell was brought to Boston, stored there and afterwards sold to pay storage. Another tradition is, that it fell into the hands of the British during the war. May 29, 1753. At the first meeting after incorpora tion, the district \" voted to confirm and establish what was voted in Groton west parish.\" The practical use or legal effect of this vote is not perceived. 2 Tradition says, that William Prescott, afterwards Colonel Prescott, an inhabitant of the parish, was a lieutenant in that expedition, and conversed with the commander-in-chief on the contemplated incorporation of the place as a town or district, and proposed the name ; but the Prescott manuscript hereinafter noticed, makes no mention of this service, but says he was a lieutenant in the forces sent to remove the neutral French in Nova Scotia, under Col. Monkton in 1755. Besides, Prescott was but nineteen years of age at the time of the former expedition, and that about eight years before the incorporation of the district, so that neither his lieutenancy nor the con versation would seem probable."], [341, "311 SECOND MEETING-HOUSE. In the year 1767, the district took preparatory steps to build a new meeting-house. They voted to raise the sum of eighty pounds for the purpose, and that the house should be sixty feet long, forty feet wide and twenty feet high, with porches. In 1768, \"voted that the meeting house be built workman-like.\" Also \"chose William Prescott a committee to join the committees from the several towns in this Province, considering the awful frowns of divine Providence upon our land and on this Province in a particular manner, whereby our civil privi leges are greatly threatened, and considering we are en gaged in the important affair of building a new house for the worship of God, voted to set apart Thursday as a day of fasting and prayer, to confess our manifold sins, whereby we have provoked our God to frown upon us in our public affairs, and earnestly to implore the returns of his favor, and particularly to humble ourselves before God, for our unprofitableness under the means of grace we have enjoyed in the old meeting-house, and to entreat his guidance in erecting a new one.\" In 1769, a question arose whether the house should have a steeple, which was finally decided in the negative. Cornet Gilson was the undertaker to build the new house, and as part compensation he had the old one, which he removed to his farm and used as a barn. It has since been burnt. The new house was dedicated March 8, 1770, on which occasion Mr. Emerson preached the sermon, before quoted, from this text, \" Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.\" In this discourse Mr. Emerson enumerates various reasons why the people of Pepperell should set up their Ebenezer, and gratefully acknowledge that \" hitherto the Lord had helped them.\" Such as the preservation of the church, when threatened with total destruction ; that God had"], [342, "312 PRESENT MEETING-HOUSE. had his eye upon New England ever since its settlement ; that the number of the inhabitants of Pepperell since his settlement had increased from seventy-two, to one hundred and fifty-two families, and that their interest and wealth had increased in as great proportion ; that they had been able to pay the charges of becoming a parish, a district, building a house for worship, and that peace, love and harmony had prevailed in settling the gospel among them ; that they had been preserved from savage enemies while it was a frontier place, and they were under the necessity of carrying their weapons of war with them to the house of worship, as they had done since his settle ment ; that the great sickness, which had prevailed among them several years, had been stayed ; and that they had been preserved while erecting and finishing the second meeting-house, not a life having been lost or a bone broken while providing the timber, raising the frame and finishing the house ; and finally, that he himself would on this occasion set up his Ebenezer, it being the twenty third anniversary of his ordination, and acknowledge that \" hitherto the Lord had helped him,\" both in temporal and spiritual things. This second meeting-house is the same that is now owned and occupied by the first parish in Pepperell. In the year 1836, it having been in constant use for sixty six years, and being out of repair and not adapted in its form to modern taste, the parish undertook to remodel and repair it throughout. The following extracts from records show the progress of that work. \" July 31, 1836. On this day we assembled for public worship for the last time in the old meeting-house ; we, on this day, bade adieu to the old places where generation after generation had kept holy time.\" \" The parish, with a decisive energy which did them credit, took the neces sary steps in order to the work being effected.

At length, however, on the 26th of October, the work was finished, and on Thursday, the 27th, the house in its new form was sol emnly dedicated to 'the service of Almighty God.\" \"It was to us a season of heartfelt joy, of gratitude to God and of mutual congratulation. The work of our hands had been prospered. A new temple had been raised up for us, and we, who had held our religious festivals under the most uncomfortable and disheartening circumstances, were now permitted to worship God amid the beauty of the sanctuary.\" \" It is only giving honor to whom honor is due to record in this place, that by the generosity of the ladies of this parish, the pulpit was trimmed and the aisles carpeted throughout.\" \" The Bible in two volu i es was a generous donation from Mrs. E. Bass of Boston, a daughter of the Rev. Mr. Bullard, a former pastor of this church. The communion table was a present from Mrs. Thomas Bancroft of this town.\" A handsome silver goblet was presented by Madam Prescott of Boston, March, 1846. In the year 1831, a large number of the inhabitants of the town, including a great majority of the members of the church, withdrew from public worship in the meet ing-house, and held meetings for a time in a private hall. They \" signed off,\" as the phrase is, from the town, or first parish, and formed a second parish by the name of the \" Evangelical Congregational Society.\" In 1832, they built a commodious meeting-house, finished in modern style, having a steeple and clock. It was dedica ted October 31, 1832. 40"], [344, "CHAPTER XV.

Shattuck now lives, were used as places of wor ship before a meeting-house was built.

Mr. Joseph Emerson, of Maiden, a call to settle in the gospel ministry in said parish, and to give him one hundred and twenty pounds settlement, and sixty-two pounds ten shil lings salary yearly, and thirty cords of fire-wood, cut and delivered at his door.\" In January following, the parish voted to give Mr. Emerson forty acres of land within a mile of the meeting-house, and to increase his salary twelve pounds ten shillings when the parish should con tain one hundred ratable families. At that time it con tained seventy-two families. Mr. Emerson's answer to the call was in the affirmative, and he was ordained Feb ruary 25, 1746-7. The sermon on the occasion was preached by his father, the minister of Maiden, from this text : \" Thou, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.\" A church had been organized (or gathered, according to the technical phrase of the times) on the 29th of January next preceding the ordina tion, and Mr. Emerson was formally admitted a member of it on the morning of his ordination. The church at this time consisted of fifteen male members, eleven of whom had been dismissed from the church in Groton for the purpose of forming this. The number of females is not exactly known, but it is supposed there were nearly as many as males.1 Mr. Emerson's salary was regulated something in the manner of Dr. Chaplin's of Groton ; according to the price of produce, provisions, and other necessaries of life ; but with a little more propriety and justice in the quantities of articles stated, upon which to make the calculation. 1 By a paragraph in a discourse delivered by the Rev. Mr. Andrews, at Pepperell, January 29, 1847, it would seem there were no females, vid. p. 23. But the names of the wives of at least ten of the males are named in the records as original members, and not under the head of admissions. This seems to be proof positive, that there were female members at the time of organization."], [346, "316 PEPPERELL. The following lists were made out by a committee for that purpose, which were accepted by the parish and by Mr. Emerson. \" Sixty pounds upon Grain. \" Corn at 12s. per bush. Rye, 16s.

Hd. per ounce. Upon this change in his compensation Mr. Emerson remarks : \"I heartily re joice that you have seen fit to set aside the old contract, which hath been the occasion of so much trouble. As to the sum you offer me instead of it, I thankfully accept of it. All things considered, it is honorable and kind, and is a token, that after so many years, my labors are yet acceptable among you.

Im mediately upon the assembling of the army at Cambridge, he repaired thither to visit his numerous parishioners there in arms, and is said to have offered the first prayer ever made in the American camp. While there, he took a cold, which induced the disease of which he died, Octo ber 29, 1775, \u00e6t. 51. He left a widow and five children, four sons and a daughter. He appears to have been a very useful, faithful, and successful minister ; beloved, esteemed, reverenced by the church and people of his charge. His religious views and principles undoubtedly harmonized with those of most of the clergy of his time in New England ; though if we may judge from his writings, and the plain, simple, practical covenant of his church, we must suppose that he had more liberality and Christian charity, and less dogmatism and bigotry, than many of them. Ultra Calvinism had not, however, at that time been portrayed in the unscriptural and meta physical language of Edwards, Hopkins, and Emmons ; nor had the absurd and contradictory dogmas of these found their way into the creeds and covenants of so many churches, as they afterwards did. During the twenty-nine years of his ministry he bap tized eight hundred and seven persons, admitted one hundred and ninety-six to the church, and solemnized one hundred and seventy-three marriages. Eight deacons were elected by the church, and by him inducted into office, viz. : Jeremiah Lawrence, John Spafford, January 11, 1747-8; Josiah Fiske, January 18, 1754; Peleg Lawrence, August 21, 1754 ; Thomas Laughton, August 3, 1759; David Blood, April 9, 1762; Daniel Fiske, April 23, 1773 ; Edmund Parker, October 8, 1773.

The congregation was not, however, destitute of preaching for the whole of that time. Mr. Joseph Emerson, a son of the deceased pastor, and Mr. Jonathan Allen, each preached in the place for some time, and the 2 The form used by Mr. Emerson on these occasions was as follows : \u2014 \" Dear Brother : \u2014 We congratulate you upon the honor, which the Lord Jesus Christ, the Head of the church, hath been pleased to confer upon you ; for we doubt not but you had a call to this office, which under the influence of his Spirit, as we trust, you have accepted; that Spirit, which Christ hath purchased and promised to send down, not only to convince and convert the sinner, but also as a guide and teacher to his people, and hath assured us, that he should lead us into all truth. You are sensible (here is a work as well as an honor, attending the office, which you must see to it that you fulfil. I would therefore charge you in the -name of the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge both the quick and the dead, another day, before (he elect angels and this assembly, that you faithfully discharge the duties of your station, that you fulfil the ministry you have received. See to it, that you be honest andjust with respect to the treasure, which may be committed to you ; see to it, that you answer the character of the deacons in the word of God, ' Be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre, hold the mystery of the faith in a pure con science.' See to it, that you govern your children and household well, ' be blameless, be an example to believers themselves,' let your conversation be as becometh godliness, watch and pray continually, that those who seek occasion to speak evil of you, may find none; live always as under the eye of the Loid Jesus Christ, who will shortly call you to give an account of your stewardship. If you thus behave and do, ' you will purchase to your self a good degree ' of favor with God and good men, and ' great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.' And let me put you in mind, that as the Lord Jesus and this his people, expect more from you in this relation than ever, so there is strength enough in Christ for you, and he will not leave you, if you do not first forsake him. O, then, repair to him by a lively faith. Go out of yourself, trust wholly in him, so when you are weak in yourself, you will be strong in him ; so shall you fulfil your course at length with joy, and your Lord will say to you, ' Well done, good and faithful ser vant ; as you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things, enter into the joy of your Lord.'

BULLARD'S CALL AND ORDINATION. 319 latter received an invitation to settle, which was declined. At length Mr. John Bullard, of Medway, a graduate of Harvard college in 1776, was invited by the church and town to become their pastor and religious teacher, and he accepted their invitation. His ordination took place. October 18, 1779. His ministry was long, prosperous and happy. If there were not so many who made pub lic profession of religion under his ministry in proportion to the length of time and number of parishioners, as under that of his predecessor, the deficiency must be attributed to the spirit of the times, and the various important matters which agitated the public mind, and absorbed the attention of all, and prevented many from devoting their time and talents to the promotion of morality and religion. The war of the revolution, the formation and adoption of systems of general and state governments, devising the methods of administering those governments after adoption, and measures to be pursued under them during the long protracted and eventful wars in Europe, a second unnecessary and impolitic war with England, were matters unpropitious to the culture and growth of Christian principles and practices. These all happened during Mr. Bullard's ministry, and in some of them his parishioners took a deep interest. Notwith standing these discouragements and hinderances, one hundred and fifty-six members were added to his church ; he baptized five hundred and fifty-six individuals, and solemnized four hundred and twenty-nine marriages. Four deacons were elected, viz. Nathaniel Hutchinson, Nathaniel Lakin, April 23, 1789 ; Jonas Parker, Edmund Jewett, August 15, 1805. Clergymen, who were his associates and have survived him, give testimony of his urbanity, affability, love of science, respectability of talents, and manner of dis charging his parochial duties. In his theological opinions he probably differed but little from his predecessor ; a"], [350, "320 PEPPERELL. trinitarian, but on other points an Arminian rather than a Caivinist. He was much engaged in the cause of learning and instruction of youth ; was one of the first projectors and contributors to the establishment of the academy at Groton, and a trustee thereof from its incorporation till his death. Three of his sons finished their studies, pre paratory to entering college, in that institution. \" Having nearly completed the forty-second year of his ministry, he died September 18, 1821, honored and esteemed by his friends and the people of his charge in life, and truly lamented in death. \u2014 He left a widow and eight children, four sons and four daughters, to mourn the loss of an affectionate and devoted husband and father.\" In about a year after the death of Mr. Bullard, Mr. James Howe, of Jaffrey, New Hampshire, who had been graduated at Dartmouth college in 1817, and had studied theology at the institution in Andover, was chosen by the town and church their teacher and pastor. At this period a large portion of the clergy of New Engla id, assuming to themselves exclusively the title of orthodox, had begun in effect to say to their brethren of the other portion, (whether as learned, pious, humble and orthodox Christians as themselves or not, God knoweth,) \" Stand by thyself, come not near me ; for I am holier than thou.\" They had assumed the position, that those only, who believed and embraced certain polemic doc trines and articles of faith, constituted the true and only proper church, and that to hold fellowship, and exchange ministerial services with any, who did not assent to all these essentials, as they termed them, would be no better than tolerating heresy, and holding communion with heretics. They had therefore come to the determination not to exchange pulpit services with Arminians, Unita rians, and other liberal denominations of Christians,"], [351, "321 EXCLUSIVE SYSTEM. denying them even the name of Christians. To this \"exclusive system,\" /as it has been called, which, with the relaxation from all legal obligation to support any religious instruction or public worship, about that time and since,Mias rent most of the towns and territorial par ishes asunder, and set at variance, Christian friends and neighbors, the Rev. Mr. Bullard while living, and the good people of Pepperell generally, were strongly opposed. On the occasion therefore of settling a min ister, caution was taken to pursue such measures, as should prevent the town and church, hitherto remarkable for their unamimity, from division. ( In selecting a coun cil to assist in the ordination of their pastor elect, they took pastors and delegates from eleven congregations, who were in favor of the exclusive system, and from nine, who were more liberally inclined, intending, if possible to be on terms of communion and fellowship with all regular Congregational churches and societies. As Mr. Howe's education and associations had been with the party favoring exclusiveness, some fears were enter tained that he might be inclined to join with them in their measures. In order therefore to prevent all misun derstanding on that point, some of the legal voters, to the number of seventy-niue, signed a remonstrance against the ordination of Mr. Howe, solely from apprehensions respecting exchanges, and laid it before the council on the day appointed for the ordination. Whereupon the pastor elect was freely and fully interrogated on that point by the council, and he gave such assurauces of his willingness to exchange pulpits with each member of the council, and all neighboring ministers of regular standing of the Congregational order, that the remonstrants were satisfied, and withdrew all objections. Mr. Howe was accordingly ordained, October 16, 1822. For several of the first years of his ministry, there was general harmony between pastor and flock, the fulfilment 41"], [352, "322 PEPPERELL. of the promise being satisfactorily observed. But as exclusiveness became more strictly enforced by its authors and abettors, Mr. Howe was compelled either to violate his promise, or lose fellowship with the friends of that system. He chose the former alternative.3 Upon this, his parishioners became dissatisfied, and communed with him in a friendly manner, on his neglecting to exchange services with some of their favorite neighboring ministers. But he could not be prevailed with to return to his promised course in this matter. Whereupon a town meeting was held, May, 11, 1831, at which the following vote passed : \" Voted, To excuse the Rev. James Howe from preaching six Sabbaths in the course of the ensuing year, and permit the pulpit to be supplied on those Sab- baths by ministers of other denominations.\" This move- ment Mr. Howe and a minority of the town, including a large majority of the members of the church, chose to consider an expulsion from the pulpit. They therefore withdrew, and formed a separate religious society. The town became thus divided into two parishes, with less trouble and contention than has happened in many other towns in the country. The town or first parish and church proper, thus becoming destitute of a minister and pastor, on the 19th day of January, 1833, invited Mr. Charles Babbidge to 3 Whether or not Mr. Howe adopted the least objectionable course, in the \" strait betwixt two,\" into which he was driven, will, in men's judgment, probably be decided differently ; by some in the affirmative, by others in the negative, according to their different estimation of justice and expediency. But either course would, in the minds of all honest, honorable, upright men and Christians, have been preferable to the mean and contemptible position, in which his friends, (if friends they can be called,) have since his death endeavored to place him. In order to evade the reproach of being a promise-breaker, they have represented him as making a promise, which he knew would be understood according to its express terms, in one manner, and by a secret, non-committal, mental evasion, reserving to himself tbe right to interpret it in another manner.

He gave an affirmative answer to their call, and on the 13th of February, 1S33, a regular ecclesiastical council having assembled for the purpose, ordained him over the first parish in Pepperell and the church thereof. The Rev. Charles Babbidge was born at Salem, Octo ber 27, 1806 ; was graduated at Harvard University, 1828 ; and studied theology at the institution in Cam bridge. He was married to Eliza Ann Bancroft, daughter of Mr. Luther Bancroft, July 1, 1839. He continues in the ministry at Pepperell, in much peace and harmony, to the highest satisfaction of the people of his charge, and to their eminent opportunity for instruction and advance ment in Christian virtues. Dr. John Walton and Mr. Benjamin Hall, were chosen deacons of the church, September 4, 1832 ; and Mr. Nathaniel Sartell, Jr., March 22, 1837, was chosen to the same office, to supply the place of Dea. Hall, deceased. February 9, 1847, being the completion of just one hundred years since the organization of this church, was celebrated by its members and the congregation, as its first centennial anniversary. The church in Groton, from which most of the original members of this church were dismissed, in order to found this, were invited to join in the festival. The Rev. pastor made an ingenious and per tinent address on the occasion, and a sumptuous collation closed the ceremonies.4 4 While partaking of the collation, the following \"letter missive\" was read : \" Address to the first church in Pepperell, in 1947, prepared by Mr. John Bullard, son of Rev.

On the first day of February, 1831, at the call of the Rev. Mr. Howe and those who with him separated them selves from the town or first parish, an ecclesiastical council assembled, approved the proceedings of the seceders, and recognized Mr. Howe as their minister. About three years before his death, Mr. Howe's health began to decline, so that he could but partially perform the duties of his office. He continued, however, to preach occasionally, as health permitted, till within a little more than a year of his death, which event happened, July 19, 1840, in the 44th year of his age. Mr. Howe married Harriet Nason, of Harvard, October 13, 1823, by whom he had six children, four of whom still survive. His character, as portrayed in a discourse delivered at his funeral, represents him as \"courteous, kind, and gentlemanly in his conversation and deport ment,\" sound in understanding, conservative in principle, sagacious in judgment, traits that well become a minister of the religion he professed. During Mr. Howe's long and lingering sickness, he was assisted by two or three candidates for the ministry ; and on the 29th of January, 1840, the Rev. David Andrews was, by invitation of the church and society, ordained his colleague pastor. Upon Mr. Howe's decease, Mr. Andrews became principal and sole pastor of the Evan gelical Congregational Society, which office he still retains.

Fears and alarms, however, had not entirely subsided ; so that Mr. Emerson says, after his settlement in the ministry, his parishioners carried their weapons to the house of worship. Pepperell justly claims to have produced many brave officers and soldiers. A military spirit was imbibed and cherished by the encouragements and exhortations of their minister, Mr. Emerson, who having served as chap lain at Cape Breton, took a lively interest ever after in military affairs, especially at the commencement of the revolutionary war. In the spring of 1758, a company was enlisted for the French war, from Pepperell and its vicinity, of which Thomas Lawrence was captain. As the company were about to take up their march to join the army, Mr. Emer son preached a sermon on the occasion, in which he thus addressed the soldiers: \" My Friends and Brethren, \u2014 'Tis matter of rejoicing to me, that so many of you have engaged in this affair"], [357, "hr. emerson's address to soldiers. 327 with so much cheerfulness, and proffered your services for your country ; and some of you, I hope, have entered upon it with becoming seriousness. If the present expe dition should go forward, according to our present expect ation, (which God grant it may !) and not be stigmatized, as some former ones have been, by the name of a mock expedition, whereby we are become the shame of our friends and contempt of our enemies ; I say, if the army should proceed, you will doubtless be called into action, and must expect to jeopardize your lives in the high places of the field. Fix this, then, in your minds, that danger you must encounter ; imagine not that you are going out against a weak and effeminate enemy, who will be affrighted as soon as they hear of your approach, or be intimidated by the very sound of your drums, and run away as soon as you charge them, and you have nothing to do, but fall upon the prey, and load yourselves with the spoils. Far from this. You are going against an enemy who are far from being dastardly ; an enemy flushed with various and repeated successes. And as you are designed, by the present concerted scheme of opera tion, to enter the very heart of the enemy's country, you may well expect that they will not tamely resign their possessions into your hands. I say not these things to discourage you, but rather to animate you to set out with greater resolution and courage. If you alight upon dangers, this will not make them heavier when they come, and it may serve something to lessen them. You are to fight ; you are enlisted for this end ; you are paid for this purpose. Boldly, then, advance into the very heart of your enemy's country. Fear them not ; let it never be said of a New England soldier, \u2014 let it never be said of a Pepperell soldier, that he was afraid to face his enemies, or that ever he turned his back on them, and cowardly deserted the cause of his country.\""], [358, "328 PEPPERELL. Capt. Lawrence, the commander of this company, is represented as a man of gigantic stature, Herculean strength, bold and courageous, experienced in Indian warfare, aud holding in thorough contempt the valor of the savages. He often said, he would never run for an Indian or Indians, and that he would never be taken alive by them. This assertion was verified in the manner of his death. Having the command of a ranging party of about twenty men, in 1758, at a place called \" Half-way brook,\" they were suddenly surrounded by Indians. Many of the party fell by the first fire ; a few ran and escaped. Capt. Lawrence sprang to a tree, and shouted, \"To cover, to cover, boys !\" Being closely pressed on all sides, those who remained were soon all slain, except the gallaut captain, and he was mortally wounded. He finally fell by the strokes of a number of the enemy. His body, when found, was in a horribly mangled state. Sympathizing with their minister in the ardor and zeal he felt in the contention between the colonies and the British ministry, previous to the commencement of hos tilities, the inhabitants of Pepperell were among the first to notice the unconstitutional and arbitrary acts of Parlia ment, which led to the separation of the colonies from the mother country ; among the first to express emphati cally their opinion in relation to those acts ; and among the first forcibly to defend what they deemed their rights and privileges. Perhaps come of the following extracts from the district and town records were penned by Mr. Emerson. On the 25th of October, 1765, the district voted to give the following instructions to their representative in the General Court, for his conduct in this important crisis. \" To Abel Lawrence, Esq. \" Taking into consideration the measures that have been adopted by the British ministry, and acts of Parlia-"], [359, "329 STAMP ACT. ment made, which press hard upon our invaluable rights and privileges, by the royal charter granted to the first settlers of this province, the power of making laws and levying taxes invested in the General Assembly. It is certain we were not represented in Parliament, neither were the remonstrances sent by this province admitted there, when the late act, called the stamp act, by which an insupportable and unconstitutional tax is laid on the colonies, was made. We, therefore, think it our indispen sable duty to desire you by no means to join in any measures for countenancing or assisting in the execution of the said stamp act. Furthermore, as the trade of this province is greatly obstructed, and the people labor under an almost insupportable debt, we expect you will use your utmost endeavors, in the General Assembly, that the monies of the province drawn from the individuals, may not be applied to any other uses, under any pretence what ever, than what is evidently intended in the act for sup plying the province treasury.\" January 24, 1766, Mr. Emerson preached a thanksgiv ing sermon on the repeal of the stamp act. In 1768, the district chose William Prescott a commit tee to join the committees from the several towns in this province. In 1772, the following article was inserted in a warrant for a district meeting. \" To see if the district are so generally inspired with true patriotic spirit, as to propose any method in order to retrieve and recover the constitutional liberties that have been extorted from us, contrary to the royal charter, and in order to prevent any further unjust taxes, tonnage, poundage and the like, and act thereupon as shall be thought proper, and most conducive to the happiness of all the true sons of liberty, and to American subjects in general.\" At a district meeting held January 15, 1773, \" chose a 42"], [360, "330 PEPPERELL. committee of nine men to consider what is proper for this district to do, at this alarming time, respecting the en croachments that have been made upon our civil privi leges ; \" which committee reported the following commu nication to the committee of correspondence, and also a letter of instructions to their representative, both of which follow. \" To the Committee of Correspondence, Boston. \" Gentlemen, \u2014 You will be so good as to inform the town of Boston, that we have received their kind letter, together with the pamphlet setting forth our liberties as men, as Christians, as subjects, with the infringements which have been made upon them.

Present ing the above instructions to your wise consideration, we wish, that you and all true friends to the English consti tution, may be under the divine direction, that you may be led into the paths of truth, and never be driven aside from seeking the welfare of your country.\" The district unanimously voted to accept these com munications, and chose a committee to transmit them to their respective destinations. February, 1773, the district voted to add two casks of powder, and lead answerable, to their stock of ammuni tion. June 27, 1774, the district passed the following pream ble and resolutions, and voted to send a copy thereof to Boston. \" Under a deep sense of the distressing and very extra ordinary circumstances we of this land are unhappily brought into, by (as we think) a bad ministry in our pa rent country, by the innovations already made in our civil liberties, and what seems to be further threatened, we are with concern of opinion, that it behooves us and all this province, and all North America, to set up a gene ral correspondence and to cultivate harmony, that there may be a united voice with resolution throughout this land, that we may make a proper stand, and lift up our united prayers to Almighty God to pity us, and vouchsafe to us his gracious protection, and direct us into such measures as he will please to prosper and succeed for our deliverance from the great difficulties and embarrassments we are under, and secure and save us from impending ruin, with which we are further threatened by some in power, who carry on their wicked designs as if by magic"], [363, "PATRIOTIC RESOLUTIONS. 333 art assisted.

There fore, resolved, \" 1.

And we hope and pray, that the Lord of Hosts will direct us and you and all the colonies into a right way, that His blessing may be upon our united endeavors, and may success, with peace and harmony, crown the whole to the glory of God and the tranquillity of the American colonies.\" One more extract from the records of the district deserves to be remembered, as it anticipated the great and important step taken a year afterwards by the Continental Congress. It is a part of the instructions of the inhabi tants to their representative in 1775. \" We therefore instruct you, sir, that you, in our name and behalf, signify to the Great and General Court, of which you are a member, that our opinion is, that inde pendence is the only alternative for the safety of this oppressed land, and that if the honorable Congress should think it best for the safety of the United Colonies to declare them independent of Great Britain, we acquiesce heart and hand, and are determined at the risk of life and treasure to support the measure.\" Soon the time arrives, which puts to the test the valor and the courage of Pepperell soldiery. It is soon to be known, whether their patriotism consisted of words only, and whether or not, when the crisis arrives, their actions would correspond with, and make good, their promises and resolutions. The sequel shows, that their intrepidity in action was iu no wise inferior to their skill and per tinency in expressing their opinions. William Prescott, a son of the Hon. Benjamin Prescott, though born in the centre of Groton, removed to that part of it called the \" Gore,\" which formed a part of the district of Pepperell, before he arrived at the age of twenty-one years. \" He was a lieutenant in the provin cial troops, which were sent to remove the neutral French"], [365, "MINUTE MEN CALLED OUT. 335 from Nova Scotia,\" in 1755, and possibly a soldier in the expedition to Louisburg, two years before.1 After his return from the first named expedition, he was promoted to the office of Captain. \" In 1774 he was appointed Colonel of a regiment of minute men,\" enrolled in Pep perell, Groton, Hollis, and other towns in their vicinity. On the morning of the memorable 19th of April, 1775, a messenger rode from Concord to Pepperell, alarming the inhabitants on his way with the intelligence that the \" regulars \" had come out from Boston, had killed eight men at Lexington, and were fighting at Concord. He arrived at Pepperell about nine or ten o'clock, A. M. \" Col. Prescott immediately gave order to the company in Pepperell, and the company in Hollis, to march to Groton, and there join the Groton companies, and proceeded him self to Groton.\" So expeditiously were the Pepperell company armed, equipped, and on their march, that although five miles farther from the point whence the messenger started, and consequently proportionably later in receiving the alarm, than the Groton companies, they arrived at Groton parade ground before the companies were in readiness to accompany them.2 After a halt for 1 The following anecdote relating to Lieut. Prescott, when on the expedi tion to remove the French, is from good authority, and is unquestionably correct. \" He was attacked by a fever. The surgeon of the army was very negligent in his attendance on him. One day on entering his chamber he found him so ill, that he brutally exclaimed, ' It's no use of my staying here, I can do nothing ; ' and turning his back on the patient walked out of the room. Lieut. Prescott was perfectly aware of what was said, and was filled with such rage by this unfeeling conduct, that he seized his sword, which hung near him, and springing out of bed, made after the doctor, who, as it may be believed, completed his exit with greater precipitation than he commenced it. This sally of passion had a most favorable effect, as it appeared, on the fever, which was then at its crisis, and the patient mended rapidly from that day.\" 2 It is said that Dr. Oliver Prescott, a brother of the Colonel, and chairman of the selectmen of Groton, who were then together delivering out arms and ammunition to the soldiers, on hearing the martial music and seeing the"], [366, "336 PEPPERELL. a few minutes they again marched on in advance of the Groton companies.3 Col. Prescott hastened on, with as many of his regiment as he could collect, \" to Concord, and thence to Cambridge, but did not overtake the British detachment on their retreat. He and most of his officers and men enlisted for eight months, the period of the first enlistment, and which it was then hoped, would be as long as troops would be wanted.\" The patriotism of the women in those times, \" which tried men's souls,\" must not be passed over in silence. After the departure of Col. Prescott's regiment of \" min ute men,\" Mrs. David Wright of Pepperell, Mrs. Job Shattuck of Groton, and the neighboring women, col lected at what is now Jewett's bridge, over the Nashua, between Pepperell and Groton, clothed in their absent husbands' apparel, and armed with muskets, pitchforks, and such other weapons as they could find, and having elected Mrs. Wright their commander, resolutely deter mined, that no foe to freedom, foreign or domestic, should pass that bridge. For rumors were rife, that the regulars were approaching, and frightful stories of slaughter flew rapidly from place to place and from house to house. Soon there appeared one 4 on horseback, supposed lo be Pepperell company marching to the common in full ranks, exclaimed to his brethren, \" This is a disgrace to us,\" alluding to the greater promptitude of the Pepperell soldiers than of their own. 3 One of the Pepperell company, (Abel Parker, since Judge of Probate in the county of Cheshire, N. H.) ploughing in a distant field, did not re ceive the alarm in season to start with the rest ; but on hearing it, left his oxen in the field unyoked, ran home, seized his gun in one hand, his Sunday coat in the other, sat out upon a run, and slacked not till having passed the Groton companies, he overtook his fellows at Groton ridges. 4 Capt. Leonard Whiting, of Hollis, N. H., a noted tory. He was in reality the bearer of despatches from Canada to the British in Boston.

By the implicit command of Sergeant Wright, he is immediately arrested, unhorsed, searched, and the treasonable correspondence found concealed in his boots. He was detained prisoner and sent to Oliver Prescott, Esq., of Groton, and his despatches were sent to the Committee of Safety. As Pepperell has the honor of being the residence of Col. William Prescott, and he being chief in command on the American side in the first battle of any considerable consequence, that was fought in the revolutionary war, a history of that town would be unpardonably incomplete, without some account of that engagement and of that valiant officer. For the following narration, as well as for many other matters relating to Pepperell and to the Prescott family, the author is indebted to the courtesy of a distinguished descendant of the commander on Bunker Hill, for the use of a manuscript, penned at sundry times, and kept by sundry persons of that family, of the truth and correctness of which no doubt can exist. \" On the 16th of June, 1775, Gen. Ward, the com mander-in-chief, issued an order for placing three Massa chusetts regiments, (Col. Prescott's, Col. Frye's, and Col. Bridge's,) and a detachment of one hundred and twenty men from a Connecticut regiment, (under the command of Capt. Knowlton, a brave officer,) about one thousand in all, under the command of Col. Prescott, directing him to proceed to Bunker Hill, and there erect a fortification ; stating that the party should be relieved the next morning. They therefore took only a small supply of provisions with them. Col. Gridley, an experienced engineer, was ap pointed to lay out the works. The detachment was drawn up on the common iu Cambridge on the evening of that day, attended prayers by the Rev. Dr. Langdon, then President of Harvard college, and when daylight 43"], [368, "338 PEPPERELL. was gone, Col. Prescott led them silently down Charles town road over the neck, and then halted, called around him the field officers, with Col. Gridley, aud then first communicated to them his orders, and conferred with them respecting the place intended for the fortification. \"The whole height at that time was popularly called ' Bunker Hill,' although the southern part was known as ' Breed's Hill ' by the neighbors. After some discussion, the southern part, now better known as Breed's Hill, was determined on. This caused some delay. The detach ment proceeded to Breed's Hill, and Col. Gridley laid out the works, a redoubt and entrenchment, which the troops immediately commenced building. This was about eleven o'clock. Col. Prescott was anxious lest they should be discovered and attacked in the night, or too early in the morning ; and, to satisfy himself, went in person, accom panied by an officer, twice to the margin of the river, and much to his satisfaction found that they were not discov ered. The sentinels on board the ships were drowsily calling out, 'All 's well.' Daylight made the discovery. A heavy cannonade from the ships and Copp's Hill then commenced, which annoyed them, but did not materially retard their work.5 About nine o'clock it became appar ent that the British were preparing to cross the river and attack them. The officers then urged Col. Prescott to send a messenger to head quarters, and request the com mander to relieve them according to his engagement, as they had brought on no provisions for a longer time, and had worked all night. This he refused, saying, the works should be defended by those who built them ; their honor 5 \" One man was killed outside of the redoubt. Seeing the soldiers gath ering around the body, Col. Prescott ordered them to cover it with earth immediately. They inquired if they might not have prayers over it. He told them, that might be done after the battle, but it must be covered with earth immediately. Finding the men still continued round the body, regard less of the danger, he ordered the body to be thrown into the trench, and earth thrown over it.\""], [369, "339 BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL. required it, and they could do it successfully; but he would send for reinforcements aud refreshments. He accordingly despatched two messengers in the course of the morning ; the last, Major, afterwards Governor Brooks. This last message produced an order to Col. Stark and Col. Reed, of the New Hampshire troops, to march their regiments to his assistance. They arrived just at the commencement of the action, and posted their regiments at the rail fence,6 where they fought with great bravery. The Connecticut company, under Capt. Knowlton, were posted at the end of the rail fence nearest the breastwork, and the three Massachusetts 7 regiments defended the redoubt. The action began between two and three o'clock. The redoubt was the great object of attack, and the principal force was directed against it, while three regiments advanced towards the rail fence, with intent to come on the rear of the redoubt and cut off the retreat of the Americans. The British were twice repulsed with great loss from the redoubt and from the fence. \" The British officers were obliged to make great exer tions to bring up their men a third time. They however succeeded, and made a third attack, with great spirit, on the redoubt and at the fence. The redoubt was entered on the southern or southeastern side, and at the same time the enemy advanced between the breast-work and the rail fence, to the rear of the redoubt. A few men were shot down as they mounted the breast-work ; among others, 6 One rail fence was pulled up and placed parallel to another left stand ing, and the intermediate space silled with grass, mown on the spot the day previous. ' \" Gen. Warren came up to the works a short time before the action was commenced, with a musket in his hand. Col. Prescott proposed to him that he should take the command, as he understood he had been appointed a major-general the day before. Gen. Warren replied, ' 1 have no command here ; I have not received my commission. I come as a volunteer, and shall be happy to learn service from a soldier of your experience.' \""], [370, "340 PEPPERELL. Major Pitcairn ; but the ammunition of the Americans was exhausted ; a cartridge of one of the field pieces furnished powder to load the last muskets that were discharged. They had few bayonets, and were obliged to use the butts of their guns. \" The enemy had entered the redoubt on one side, and were advancing to the rear of it, when Col. Prescott or dered the retreat. He was among the last that left the redoubt, and before leaving it, was surrounded by the enemy, and had several bayonets pushed at his body, which he parried with his sword, in the use of which he had some skill ; they, however, pierced his banyan 8 and waistcoat, but he was not wounded.9 \" Col. Prescott was always confident he could have maintained his position, with the handful of men under his command, if he had been supplied with ammunition. The British staggered before they entered the redoubt, and he thought would not have rallied, if they had been again repulsed. \" On his return to Cambridge, he immediately repaired to head-quarters, where he found the commander-in-chief, Gen. Ward, in great distress, apprehensive that the enemy, encouraged by their success, might advance on Cambridge and attempt to penetrate into the country. Col. Prescott assured him, that the enemy's confidence would not be increased by the result of the action, and offered to retake the heights that night, or perish in the attempt, if the commander-in-chief would give him three regiments, with bayonets and sufficient ammunition. The com mander-in-chief thought, perhaps justly, that the charac- 8 \" Dr. Oliver Prescott, the y mnger, who relates the fact, says, that soon after the battle, he was at Pepperell, and his uncle, Col Prescott, shewed him the banyan and waistcoat, and the rents or holes made in them by the British bayonets.\" 9 Eight of the Pepperell soldiers were killed in this battle, and eight wounded.

We afterwards saw, that this battle made a lasting impression on Gen. Howe's mind, and rendered him an over-cautious commander during the remainder of his command.\" \" Col. Prescott continued in the service until the end of 1776. He was stationed at Governor's Island, New York, until the Americans were obliged to retire from the city. The good order, in which he brought off his regi ment, was noticed and publicly commended by Gen. Washington. At the end of this campaign, he returned to his farm and family in Pepperell, where he resided till his death. In the autumn of 1777, he went as a volun teer, accompanied by some of his former officers, to assist in the capture of the army under Gen. Burgoyne, which was his last military service.\" Perhaps his exertions and activity in the suppression of Shays's insurrection, and going to Concord with his side arms, to protect the courts, should be excepted in the last remark. After his retirement from the army, he served his townsmen in the municipal offices of clerk and selectman, and represented the town in the General Court three years. He was an acting magistrate for the remainder of his life. He died October 13, 1795, \u00e6t. 69. In his person he was tall, his frame large and muscular, but not corpulent, his features strong and intelligent. He possessed a strong mind, but had not the advantage of much education, a common town school being the only seminary he ever attended ; so he was self-taught. Yet he was fond of reading, especially history, in which he spent much of his time, evenings and nights. His man ners were plain but courteous ; his disposition benevolent and kind ; he was liberal even beyond his means ; and was always ready to assist others in their affairs to the neglect of his own."], [372, "342 PEPPERELL. He married Abigail Hale of Sutton, by whom he had one son, the late Hon. William Prescott of Boston. She was a kind, prudent, amiable and excellent wife, such a companion for life as such a man as Col. Prescott ought to choose. Her extraordinary care and prudence, not tinctured in the least with selfishness or parsimony, were a salutary counterpart to his liberality and negligence of his own affairs. She survived him twenty-six years, con tinuing her residence on the Prescott estate in Pepperell, respected and beloved by all her neighbors and friends, till her death, October 21, 1821, at the advanced age of 88 years. Pepperell was the birth-place, though not the constant residence, of William Prescott, the only offspring of Col. William and Abigail Prescott. A short memoir of so wise, so great, and so good a man, must not be omitted in a history of the place of his nativity, and the place of his retirement in summer for many years and until his death. He was born August 19, 1762. He lived in his father's family on the farm till he was fourteen years of age, working like other farmers' boys of his age, and attending the common district school the short time it was kept each season, and for several years visited his uncle in Groton, and attended school there a month or six weeks at a time. In the autumn of 1776, he was put to Dum mer's school at Byfield to prepare for college, under the instruction of that famous master, Samuel Moody. In July, 1779, being well fitted, according to the require ments of that day, he entered Harvard college. Having there studied the usual time, he received his first degree, and immediately, (even a little before the end of his last term in college,) commenced school keeping in Brooklyn, Connecticut. Here, however, he tarried but a few months, the school which was intended by its patrons for an Academy being discontinued for want of funds. Soon after his return home, he was recommended to a private"], [373, "343 JUDGE WILLIAM PRESCOTT. school in Beverly, where he could enjoy the advantage of reading law with an eminent counsellor, Hon. Nathan Dane. This he found a very eligible situation, both for the acquisition of knowledge aud forming valuable ac quaintances, both of which he improved to advantage, for present enjoyment and future usefulness. In 1787, he was admitted to the bar, and in the absence of Mr. Dane, he being at Congress, opened an office 'in Bev erly. But on Mr. Dane's return to resume his professional business, Mr. Prescott removed to Salem, where he prac ticed extensively and successfully nineteen years. He then removed to.Boston, where he devoted himself principally to professional business till 1828, when his health obliged him to relinquish it. Besides his practice as an advocate and counsellor, he filled many stations in the service of his country with fidelity, and to the universal acceptation of his constituents and the public. He was representa tive in the General Court for Salem in 1798, and the three next succeeding years, and served the city of Boston several years in the same capacity. He was senator for the county of Essex in 1805, but declined a re-election. He was one of the executive council in 1809, under Gov. Gore, and in the same office several years during Gov. Strong's administration. He twice had the offer of a seat on the bench of the supreme judicial court, but in both instances declined it. He was afterwards induced to accept the office of judge of the court of common pleas for the city of Boston, but having filled it about a year, and finding its duties irksome, he resigned it. In 1820, he was chosen by the citizens of Boston a delegate to the convention for altering and amending the State constitu tion. To close this account of public services, in which chro nological order has not been exactly pursued, one more must be named, which, however some may be disposed to undervalue it, was no less a mark of his patriotism to"], [374, "344 PEPPERELL. accept, than of the high estimation in which he was held by the most intelligent part of his fellow citizens. He was appointed by the Legislature of Massachusetts in 1814, a delegate to meet in convention with other delegates of the New England States at Hartford, \" the great object of which was, to convince Congress, and the administration, of the sufferings of the people of New England, the dan gers to' which they were exposed, their inability to defend their extensive sea coast at their own expense, the troops stationed along it having been withdrawn to the frontier, and to induce the government to provide for its defence during the war, and to make peace, as soon .as it could be done consistently with the honor and interest of the country.\" \" Being deeply engaged (I quote his own words) in professional business, and thinking I had devoted a full share of my time to the service of the public for several years preceding, it was with reluctance I accepted the ap pointment. My friends urged me, alleging that there was reason to fear that some rash measure might be pro posed in the convention, that I should oppose ; and enter taining some apprehension on this L\u201ead myself, and think ing I might be of some service in such an event, I yielded. I am happy to be able to state, that these apprehensions proved entirely groundless ; that no such measure was ever proposed in the convention ; nor was there a mem ber of that body, who, in my opinion, would have con sented to any act, which would have tended directly or indirectly to impair the union of the States. Their pro ceedings were thought tame, when their report first ap peared ; afterwards, as it is well known, they afforded unscrupulous demagogues a fruitful topic for declamation and calumny.\" In the year 1814, Harvard University conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws, and the same year he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences."], [375, "HON. WM. PRESCOTT. 345 In December, 1793, he married Catharine G. Hickling, daughter of Thomas Hickling, Esq., of the island of St. Michael's ; and an exceedingly happy connection it proved to be, though the untimely death of so many of their children served as an alloy to their otherwise happy allot ment. They had seven children, four of whom died in infancy. William Hickling, the well-known historian, and Elizabeth, wife of Hon. Franklin Dexter, are still living. Edward Goldsborough, who was graduated at Harvard University, in 1825, and was an ordained minister of the Episcopalian order, died in 1844. The writer of an obituary notice of Judge Prescott, truly says of him : \" The last sixteen years of his life were spent in the quietness of his home, where the original qualities of his nature, disencumbered from the care that had so long oppressed him, seemed to come forth with the freshness of youth. Not that he could be permitted to withdraw himself from all concern in private or public interests, in which he had been for forty years a part, and not unfrequently an important part. On the contrary, the troops of friends that gathered round his old age, still came to him, as they had always come before, with their own burdens, and perhaps yet oftener with the exigencies of the state. For no man in this community, during the last quarter of a century, felt himself too high, either from his position or from his talents, to ask counsel of Mr. Prescott\"s wisdom ; and we and our children shall feel the benefit of his noiseless influence, in our institu tions and affairs, as long as the present structure and tone of society shall last. Thus he walked onward in the paths of a venerable and beloved old age, with peace and cheerful ness, full of the deepest reverence for God, and overflow ing with sympathy and good will to his fellow-men.\" \" In the autumn of 1843, he had a slight attack of paralysis. On Sunday morning, December 8, 1844, he rose and went to his library, as usual, but had hardly 44"], [376, "346 PEPPERELL. reached it, when he perceived that the messenger of death was at his side. In a few moments, surrounded by the family he so much loved, in the full possession of his faculties, and with a peaceful trust in his Maker and in the blessedness of a future life, he expired without a struggle.\" At a meeting of the Suffolk Bar, December 10, 1844, a distinguished member remarked, \" The oldest member of our association has departed this life. He had lived to an extraordinary age, and though retired for many years from active life, he was known and respected by all of us, to some of us very long and intimately. No man ever lived among us of more amiable demeanor or purer char acter. He was a man whose integrity was incorruptible, and whose manners were most gentle and kind ; but whose firmness of principle, and at the same time, inde pendence of character, were never to be questioned.\" At the same meeting, the following resolution was unanimously adopted : \" Resolved, That the late William Prescott, whose sudden decease at a good old age, calls forth this tribute of respect, presented to his associates, throughout a long life, whether at the bar, or on the bench, or in the digni fied retirement of his late years, such an eminent example of modest talent, substantial learning, and unpretending wisdom, with affable manners, strong social affections, absolute fidelity in every station of life, and probity beyond the slightest suspicion of reproach, as rarely adorns even the highest walks of professional excellence. Concerning whom can it be more appropriately asked than of him \u2014 \" ' Cui pudor, et justiti\u00e6 soror, Incorrupta fides, nudaque veritas, Quando ullum invenient paremf\""], [377, "CHAPTER XVII Remarkable Providences. Under this title, in the church records made by the Rev. Mr. Emerson, are the following incidents, thought worthy of publication : \"July 28, 1748. About one o'clock, afternoon, we had a terrible hurricane, accompanied with shocking thunder. The course of the whirlwind was from south west to north-east, though often varying sometimes to the east, and sometimes to the west. It tore up a vast number of large trees by the roots, entirely demolished two or three buildings, shattered several dwelling-houses, carrying off the boards from the roof, sides, &c. It tore away a considerable part of the roof of the meeting-house. When it came with its violence, it threw down the fences, stone walls, and laid the corn even with the ground. One house, which it took in its way, was garri soned, and one part of the garrison was stove with violence against the house, the other sides thrown to the ground, part of the roof of the house carried away, and some things in the chamber were afterwards found above a mile from the place. A woman and three small chil dren being in the house, were wonderfully preserved ; and what was very remarkable, the woman, when she heard the wind, took her children to go into another building,"], [378, "348 PEPPERELL. where she thought she should be more safe, but was hindered by the door being stopped by part of the garri son drove up against it ; and the building she was going to was entirely demolished, not so much as the sills remaining in their places. The air, for a quarter of an hour, which was near the time it was passing through the parish, was full of leaves, hay, pieces of timber and boughs of trees. It went quite through the parish, and stopped or lost its impetuosity at the line between New Hamp shire and this province, which is a few rods from the bounds of the parish. Notwithstanding all this desolation, through the good ness of God there was not one life lost, either of man or beast, though several persons were in imminent danger, and many creatures so enclosed with fallen trees, that they could not extricate themselves. The damage sus tained was very considerable. One man, in the destruc tion of his buildings, corn, hay, fences, and apple-trees, hath lost above \u00a3500. \" September, 24, 1750. A child of William Spaulding drowned in a well, \u00e6t. one year three months. \" July 15, 1752.

Abiel Richardson, a man above thirty years old, assisting at the raising of Dunstable meeting house, fell and died in a moment. \"Nov. 10, 1755. About fifteen minutes past four o'clock in the morning, there was felt, through all New England, a most surprising earthquake, the most terrible that was ever known in this country. It lasted about three or four minutes. It shook down abundance of ' Probably the bursting of a meteor, like that at Weathersfieid, Connec ticut, some years since, accompanied with the fall of meteoric stones."], [379, "GREAT EARTHQUAKE \u2014 SICKNESS. 349 chimneys, in one part of the country and another, racked buildings, threw down stone walls. The shock was most terrible near the sea coast. From Boston we have the following account : ' Many chimneys, not much less than a hundred, are levelled with the roofs of the houses ; many more, not fewer than 1,200 or 1,500, are shattered and thrown down in part, so that in some places the streets are almost covered with the bricks which are fallen. Some chimneys, though not thrown down, are dislocated or broken several feet from the top, and partly turned round, as upon a swivel ; some are shoved on one side, horizontally, jutting over, and just nodding to the fall. The gable ends of several brick buildings, perhaps of twelve or fifteen, are thrown down from the roofs, and the houses to the eaves. The roofs of some houses are quite broken in by the fall of some chimneys. Some pumps (wells) are sadly dried up. Many clocks are stopped by being so violently agitated. \" About an hour after, another shock was felt, not very hard, and several smaller ones in the week, especially on Saturday evening, between eight and nine o'clock, which was harder than any, except the first. But through the goodness of God, not one life lost anywhere, as we hear. The first shock was heard in the southern provinces.2 \" In the latter part of summer and fall of 1756, we, of Pepperell, were visited with grievous sickness. From August 5, to the last of October, there were above 180 persons sick, of which number 18 died, chiefly of a burn ing ague. September 16, we kept a day of fasting and 2 The reader may be apprised, that the tremendous earthquake which sunk a great portion of the city of Lisbon, and shook all Europe, was on the first of November, seventeen days only previous to this New England earthquake. It can easily be conceived, that the same cause which pro duced the former, might be the preliminary one of the latter, or rather that the disturbance made in the interior parts of the earth by the former, might cause a further disturbance at a distant part of the earth, which, however, might not take place for several days after."], [380, "350 PEPPERELL. prayer, and December 13, as a day of thanksgiving, when the sickness seemed to be entirely removed. \" We were visited again with grievous sickness in 1757, the same illness we had last year. From the beginning of July to the middle of October, there were 219 persons sick, of which number 25 died, 17 heads of families. \"In 1758, we were again visited with the same grie vous illness we have been for two years before. From the first of August to the middle of October, there were 96 persons sick of the fever, of which number 11 died, 7 of whom were heads of families.3 3 January 3, 1760, was set apart by Mr. Emerson, his church and congre gation, as a day of thanksgiving, \" to commemorate the goodness of God to them the year past, especially in the removal of sickness and the return of so many soldiers from the army.\" In the sermon preached on this occasion, Mr. Emerson says, \" It pleased God, in the summer of 1755, to visit us with that grievous fever, by which we have suffered so much, and which hath, from its beginning with us, obtained the name of the Pepperell fever.\" The district contained about ninety families. After enumerasing its ravages in four successive years, he sums up the whole thus: \"In the four years abovementioned, there were above 540 persons sick; 103 died, of whom 16 were soldiers from home, or just after their return ; no less than 48 heads of families; 64 grown persons. How great was our distress for two years, especially in the height of the sickness, and we, notwithstanding, obliged to find our quota for the war ! I know not that we were eased more than a single man, excepting the time of the general alarm, when fort William Henry was besieged, in 1757, when our proportion was above twenty men at which time there were not so many able to bear arms in the place, besides those who were necessarily taken up in attending on the sick in their own families, the field officers were so good as not to call for any. One of the years, there were near 200 confined at the same time. Your pastor at the point of death, and then confined from the house of God for four months. And of this large number who have been sick, I know not of ten persons who have been visited with the same distemper twice. Nor should we forget the bounty we received by order of authority, namely, fifty pounds, to be distributed amongst the greatest sufferers.\" The proximate cause of this Pepperell fever has been thought to be the miasma arising from decayed vegetable matter. The swamp or meadow of John Shattuck, near Henry Jewett's, had been overgrown with bushes and various vegetables ; and in order to kill them and bring the land into a state of cultivation, a dam was built and the swamp overflowed with water."], [381, "351 ACCIDENTS. \" January 5, 1757.

On the other hand it has been said, that a similar disease had been prevalent in New Hampshire, and the adjoining parts of Massachusetts, for two or three years previous, and that its cause was not confined to a small locality.

In 1741, the town of Groton voted to have their school kept a part of the time at Nissitissit, which was probably on the west side of the river, and the first school kept on that side. After the west side had been set off as a par ish, viz. in 1749, a number of the parishioners petitioned the town of Groton for the means of supporting a school. The petition was granted on condition a school-room should be provided without expense to the town. The condition was complied with, and the town granted \u00a313 6s. 8d. In 1750, the parish voted that their committee should take some method to obtain of the town their proportion of the school money. In 1751, the parish voted to raise \u00a313 6s. 8d. to be laid out in schooling ; but in January, 1751-2, they voted not to put it into the assessment. After it had become a district, in 1753, a vote passed to raise \u00a37 10s. for schooling, and another, that the school should be kept at the nearest convenient place to the meeting-house ; and that all who lived more than two miles distant, might draw their proportion of the money, and appropriate it for schooling, as they should see fit. In 1754, it was voted, that the school should be kept in three places ; but it was afterwards altered to two.

November 2, 1778, the town voted to raise \u00a3400 for schooling, and chose a committee for each division ; by which it appears there were then six divisions, called the middle, south, southwest, west, north and east divisions. This division of the town into six squadrons, as they were usually called, continued many years, and a com mittee of three persons in each squadron, was annually chosen to see that the money was properly laid out. In 1809, the above names of the squadrons are dropped, and numerical districts are adopted in their stead. In May, 1819, a new school district, embracing Babbitasset village, was formed, and called No. 7. November, 1820, district No. 6 was divided, and district No. 8 was formed. March, 1835, No. 2 was divided, and No. 9 formed, but were after wards reunited. This division of the town into eight school districts, numerically named, remains to the present time. Each district has a school-house, seven of which are of brick. The moneys granted for the support of schools at seve ral times, were as follow.

In the foregoing history of Groton, Chapter V., it is shown that the southwest part of that town was incorpo rated a district by the name of Shirley,1 January 5, 1753. Its boundaries, as set off, were as follows : commencing at the place where Squannacook river empties into the Nashua ; thence northwesterly by Squannacook river to the westerly line of Groton ; thence southerly on said line, bounding on Townsend and Lunenburg, to the southwest corner of Groton ; thence easterly on Groton line, by that part of Stow called \" Stow Leg,\" to Nashua river ; thence northerly down said river to the mouth of the Squanna cook. By an act of the General Court, in 1765, 2 Stow-Leg 1 No reason, by tradition or otherwise, is given for this name. It was probably io honor of William Shirley, then governor of the province. 2 By accident or otherwise, the westerly line of Stow-Leg is not an exact continuance of the west line of Groton, but inclines a little to the east from Groton old corner lo Lunenburg corner.

The territory first described, with the two annexations, comprises the present town of Shirley.J At what time the first settlement upon this territory was made is not known, but from several considerations it is probable a settlement was commenced about the year 1720. There was no bridge talked of, over Nashua river, leading to that place, till 1722, and none built till 1726. The first birth of a white person, on the west side of Nashua river, is said to be that of Samuel Shattuck, Sep tember 25, 1726, and that birth was in what is now Pep perell, which is supposed to have been settled as soon as Shirley, or a little before. The first indication of the in habitants' desire to be a separate parish, or district, is the petition of John Whitney and thirty-two others, inserted in Chapter V. of Groton. The names of the petitioners were : John Williams, Jr., Jacob Williams, William Farwell, Jonas Longley, Oliver Farwell, Isaac Holden, Jerahmael Powers, Philemon Holden, Stephen Holden, Jr., William Simonds, John Whitney, John Williams, David Gould, John Kelsey, Phinehas Burt, Joseph Wilson, Thomas Laughton, James Patterson, Jonathan Gould, Robert Henry, the bound of old Groton southwest corner about five and a half rods to the west of the straight line. This error having been lately discovered, a petition for its correction is pending in the Legislature. 3 A petition was once presented to the General Court to have one mile in width taken from the easterly side of Lunenburg and annexed to Shirley, but it did not prevail."], [390, "360 SHIRLEY, Joseph Dodge, Moses Bennett, Jr., Caleb Bartlett, Francis Harris, Caleb Holden, Hezekiah Sawtell, Jr. William Preston, William Williams, Henry Farwell, Josiah Farwell, John Russell, James Park, Daniel Page, This list probably contains nearly or quite all the men of the place in 1747, the date of the petition. The town seems not to have made any objection to their being set off, but the act of the General Court for the purpose was not passed and signed by the Governor till January 5, 1753. The first district meeting was held at the house of Mr. John Whitney, (the present poor-house,) March 5, 1753, at which the district officers where chosen. The warrant for this meeting was issued by John Whitney, and served by Nathaniel Harris. Jonathan Bigelow was chosen moderator ; Joseph Longley district clerk ; Joseph Longley, Samuel Hazen, Nathaniel Harris, John Whitney and William Simons, selectmen and assessors. Upon a petition of the inhabitants of the district of Shirley, to the proprietors of common lands of Groton, for a parcel of land for a burying ground, the proprietors in serted the following article in a warrant for their meeting, to be holden March 7, 1755, viz. \"4. To see if the proprietors will give the district of Shirley a piece of land for a burying place, where their burying place now is, and say how much, he.\" At their meeting, the proprietors voted to give four acres, for \"a burying place and training field,\" and subse quently their committee reported as follows : \" Shirley, April 17, 1755. Then we, the subscribers, pursuant to the vote of the proprietors of Groton, have laid out a piece of land for a burying place and training field, in the district of Shirley, and it bounds as followeth : beginning at the northwest corner at a chestnut tree,"], [391, "FIRST MEETING-HOUSE. 361 thence the line runs southerly twenty-eight poles, to a red oak tree ; thence easterly twenty-four poles, to a red oak ; thence northerly twenty-eight poles, to a dead white oak tree ; thence westerly twenty-four poles, to the chestnut first mentioned. The same piece of land con tains four acres and sixteen poles.\" It appeals, that previous to this gift from the proprie tors, the inhabitants had selected a spot about half a mile to the north of this, and had buried a few bodies therein, which was abandoned, and the parcel above described taken for the purpose. A slate monument therein bears this inscription. \" This stone is erected in memory of the first burial in this yard, Abraham Holden, son of Lieut. Simon Holden and Sarah his wife, who died April 18, 1754, aged 11 months.\" The first proceeding recorded respecting a meeting house for the district, is under date of October 24, 1753. At a meeting held that day, at the house of Robert Henry, the inhabitants \" adjourned to the meeting-house place, and then voted to move the meeting-house place from where the committee stated it, about thirty poles west, to a white oak tree and heap of stones.\" William Simonds, Jerahmael Powers, and Samuel Walker were chosen a committee \" to move the meeting-house,\" pro bably the timber for the house. At the same meeting, the price of labor on the house was fixed, at four shillings per day for a man, and one shilling for a pair of oxen. Sometime in November following, the frame was set up. Its site is said to have been nearly opposite the present centre school-house. In December following, two district meetings were holden, at which it was voted to raise \u00a316, to provide materials for the house, that each inhabitant might find his proportion of the materials, that the house should be covered on the outside, the roof with long shingles, 46"], [392, "362 SHIRLEY. (afterwards altered to short ones,) both floors laid ; and to be done by the middle of May next. At a meeting held May 3, 1754, the time for com pleting the above mentioned work, and underpinning the house, was extended to four weeks from that day. Sub sequently this rude structure, as it must have been, was furnished with seats, both on the ground floor and gal lery ; and leave was granted to the inhabitants to pur chase and erect pews on the sides. The difficult but customary operation of \" seating the meeting-house,\" was performed annually, the rank in dignity of the seats determined, and the assignment made according to the amount of taxes paid by the inhabitants, unless some immorality degraded them. Ten years after its erection, and after a minister was settled, votes passed to repair it, put a window into the ministerial pew, and that as much light be given to the pulpit as possible. A wise provision, truly ! As the population of the district increased, this first meeting-house was found to be too small, and otherwise inconvenient, for a house of worship. The preliminary steps towards building a larger and more commodious house having been taken, a district meeting was held, June 29, 1772, when the following votes passed. \" Voted to raise the new meeting-house, which the district was then about to build. Then voted to adjourn said meeting for half an hour to the new meeting-house spot, to view and consider, whether it was best to raise said house on the spot, where the sills were framed ; and upon viewing the same, returned back at time and place aforesaid, and voted to raise said meeting-house on the spot 4 where the sills were framed. Chose a committee to appoint the day when said house shall be raised, and 4 This was upon a parcel of land purchased for the purpose, and adjoining the four acres granted by the proprietors of Groton for a burying place and training field, and whereon the first parish meeting-house now stands."], [393, "363 SECOND MEETING-HOUSE. to provide the materials for the raising said house, and provisions for those men, they shall appoint to raise said house, to the number of fifty men.\" The committee were John Ivory, Oliver Livermore, and John Longley. The house was fifty feet long and forty feet broad. The sum of \u00a3200 had been raised for the purpose of building said house, and on the first of January, 1773, it appeal's by the report of a committee, that \u00a3168 19s. lOd. 3qrs. had been then expended thereon. It was first occupied for religious worship, November 25, 1773, being the day of public thanks giving. The old meeting-house was disposed of, and removed to the farm now of Mr. Joseph Day, for a barn. The new meeting-house remained without material alteration till the year 1804, when after many trials and hard struggles, it was determined to add a porch to each end of the house, to remove the flights of stairs leading into the galleries, from the interior to the porches, and on one porch to have a belfry, cupola, vane, &c. Also to take out the body seats, and erect pews, and to underpin the house with split granite. These improvements were eventually made, and the house accommodated the people without further enlargement, until the year 1839. April 3, in that year, a committee of five persons were chosen to remodel and thoroughly repair the whole house. The committee were Hon. Leonard M. Parker, Hon. James P. Whitney, Joshua B. Fowle, Almond Morse, and Nathaniel Holden, Jr. This committee kept a journal of their proceedings, by which it appears, that they proceeded very systematically, judiciously, and legally, in discharging their duties. They expended the sum of $2,180 61, including payment for the old pews, in remodeling, repairing, and finishing the house. The last religious services performed in the house previous to these alterations, were on the 14th of July, 1839,"], [394, "364 SHIRLEY. and on the 27th of October following, the house was dedicated, in its new and more convenient shape and form. In 1772, the wife of John Hancock, of Boston, after wards Governor of Massachusetts, presented for the use of the pulpit, a handsome folio bible. In 1804, Wallis Little, Esq., a wealthy farmer of Shirley, presented a bell for the meeting-house ; and upon the remodeling, Thomas Whitney, Esq., David Livermore, Almond Morse, Hon. James P. Whitney, Nathaniel Holden, Jr., Joseph Day, Thomas Whitney, Jr., Wilder Dodge, Dr. Augustus G. Parker, and Hon. Leonard M. Parker, defrayed the ex pense of veneering the pulpit. The female members of the church provided a communion table and chairs ; and the female members of the church and society, cushions for the singers' seats. In the present year, 1847, Mrs. Henrietta Whitney, widow of the late Thomas Whitney, Esq., presented to the parish a fine toned organ, valued at $1,300. The first religious society, formed separate from the town, commenced about the year 1781, by a family in the south part of the town becoming attached to the teachings and doctrines of the noted Ann Lee, whose disciples call themselves United Believers ; but they are usually denominated \" Shakers.\" 5 With this famdy a 6 Desirous of giving a true account of this society, I applied to one of the brethren, from whom I received the following note. \" Esteemed friend : \" I visited the United Believers in Shirley, the better to answer your request, by furnishing some matter of interest relative to this branch of that secluded community so much ' wondered at.' Although not numerous in this town, they are undeniably a very prosperous and happy people. I find that the man [Elijah Wilds] who was owner of the ground now occupied by their village, and who erected the first dwelling, (the identical house once occupied by Mother Ann,) has furnished a simple, unvarnished statement of his connection with this sect ; and as it gives a fair specimen of the spirit and practice of said community, and those who crossed the ocean in the N."], [395, "365 UNITED BELIEVERS. number of the neighboring families sympathized, and soon a society of that denomination of Christians was formed, who erected a house of worship adapted to their peculiar style and form of worship. As a community, they appear to be industrious in their habits, honest in Y. Maria, 1774, to revive in this land of religious liberty, 'the faith once delivered to the saints,' I think it will interest your readers more than any thing, which could be written by \" Your friend, \" Lorenzo D. Grosvenor.\" On examining the statement of Elijah Wilds, kindly furnished me, and accompanying this note, I find it too long for insertion entire ; but the sub stance follows. Elijah Wilds, the founder of this sect in Shirley, was born in 1746. His early education was such, that he was the subject of strong religious impres sions ; and he sought among various denominations the true path to heaven. In the summer of 1781, hearing of a new sect in Harvard, he went thither, and was taught that the \" gospel required us to confess and forsake sin,\" and \" that Christ had commenced his second appearance without sin, unto salva tion to all, who were willing to believe and obey.\" On further visitations to that and other families of the same persuasion, and receiving instructions from them, he became fully convinced of the correctness of their doctrines and practices. Whereupon he and his wife, who embraced the same faith, by whom he had had four children, heartily and sincerely became members of the society of\" United Believers.\" He saysof the sect,\"they are a prudent, temperate, and charitable people; wise, chaste, and discreet in their language and deportment.\" And of his own experience he says, \" 1 can say in the uprightness and sincerity of my heart, that in obedience to the testimony of the gospel, which I first received from them, I have been saved from the power of sin and Satan, and loosed from the bands of death, under which I had before been bound.\" Mr. Wilds being a man of worldly substance, Mother Ann and the Elders, he says, often visited them, and \" greatly strengthened and comforted them.\" On one of these visits, June 1, 1783, his house was surrounded, about eight o'clock, P. M.,by a mob of about one hundred persons, mostly from Harvard, who continued there through the night, suffering none to go out, except one woman, who lived near by and had a nursing babe. By her, notice was sent to the town officers, two of whom came tardily in the morning to their relief. The mob, however, were not to be restrained from violence, either by the authority of the peace offi cers, or the entreaty of the Elders. Two of the Elders, consenting upon promise of safety, to accompany them to Harvard, after having partook of refreshment furnished by Mr. Wilds, they left the house. One of the two, however, was not permitted to return without having suffered corporeal in dignities from the treacherous mob."], [396, "366 SHIRLEY. their dealings, and sincere in their faith. They perem torily deny some absurd notions attributed to them by the \" world's people,\" such as that Mother Ann Lee pre tended that she should never die ; and that the common translation of the Bible is not freely used in their schools and families. Individuals in all sects sometimes hold opinions not sanctioned by their teachers. So it may have been with the \" United Believers.\" The next separation was effected by a number of indi viduals converted to the doctrine of universal salvation, who on the 21st of September, 1812, formed a society of that faith ; and in the year 1816, built a meeting-house in the south village, near the manufacturing establish ments, which was dedicated January 9, 1817. This house was not comely or convenient ; it answered, how ever, for a place of worship till the year 1846, when it was remodeled, as most of the churches have been, which were built half a century or more ago, and with the addition of a tower and steeple, is made more sightly and tasteful, as well as more commodious. Its aisles are carpeted, and an organ leads in the musical part of worship. Another separation from the first parish took place in 1820. A small number of the inhabitants formed a vol untary association, organized a church, and built a small meeting-house of bricks, a few rods north of the first parish house, on land given for that purpose by Miss Jenny Little. The society was duly organized in 1846, by the name of the \" Orthodox Congregational Society in Shirley.\" This small town, now consisting of a population of about one thousand inhabitants, has four distinct reli gious societies, and four houses for the public worship of God ; a natural consequence of improvident legislation on the subject of religion."], [397, "CHAPTER XX.

April 4, 1754, a com mittee was chosen to ask advice of six neighboring ministers, about settling a minister. May 2, 1754, \" Voted, To hire three months' preaching, and also voted, to try for some other minister besides what we have had.\" June 18, 1755, was appointed a fast, according to the custom of the times, as a preparation for giving a minister a call to settle in the place. A Mr. Goodhue, from Hollis, New Hampshire, preached some time as a candidate, and received two several invitations to settle ; the first of which he accepted conditionally, and the last he declined. April 30, 1760, it was again voted to take advice of the neighboring ministers, and probably another fast was kept. A Mr. Sparhawk, of Lynn, then preached some time, received a call to settle, but declined. At length, Mr. Phinehas Whitney, of Weston, a graduate at Harvard college, 1759, having preached some time as a candidate, received a unanimous invitation to become the minister of the district. To this invitation Mr. Whitney gave an affirmative answer. His ordination took place, June 23,"], [398, "368 SHIRLEY. 1762, an which day a church was duly organized, a church covenant adopted and signed by the pastor and twelve male members. July 26, 1762, a church meeting was held, when John Longley and Hezekiah Sawtell were chosen deacons. The church covenants and con fession of faith were taken from those in the church at Groton. They were plain, simple expressions of Chris tian duties and obligations, without the unscriptural and unintelligible formulas which at a later period became general in the churches. The church received a present of \u00a31 6s. 8c?. from Mr. Samuel Barron, of Groton, which was expended for a cloth and cups for the communion tables; and Capt. B. Bancroft, of Groton, presented a flagon for the church's use. John Ivory was chosen deacon, December 2, 1777 ; Joseph Brown, July 5, 1784; and John Heald, September 13, 1790. Mr. Whitney's ministry exceeded half a century. It was peaceful, harmonious, prosperous. The only contro versy he had with his people, and that seems to have been conducted with friendly feelings on both sides, was res pecting the competency of his support. His salary, at his ordination, was fixed at \u00a366 13s. id. This, at the time, Mr. Whitney acknowledged to be liberal. But as the revolutionary war soon after commenced, deranging the currency, and enhancing the price of the necessaries of life, that sum paid in paper currency, was evidently inadequate to his support. Several communications passed on the subject between the pastor and the people, and the matter was finally adjusted to the satisfaction of the parties, by some temporary grants, and a method of equalizing the salary by the price of grain. During his ministry, one hundred and thirty-seven persons were admitted to the church, in full communion ; one hundred and ten acknowledged the baptismal covenant; eight hundred and forty-one persons were baptized. No record of marriages is found."], [399, "MR. WHITNEY AND COLLEAGUE. 369 Having suffered, several years, from a paralytic affec tion, and arrived at the age of almost eighty years, he expired, December 13, IS 19. His family are named in the list of families in the Appendix. Mr. Whitney was a prudent manager of his temporal affairs; so that, notwithstanding the smallness of salary, he provided well for the education of his children, and left them some property. He was one of the trustees of Groton Academy, from its foundation till his death, and patronized science and literature. His standing among the clergymen of his time and vicinity was respectable, and he was often called to take part in ecclesiastical councils, aud to deliver occasional discourses, some of which were published. In his religious sentiments, he was liberal, as were most of the clergy with whom he associated. He was a kind parent, affectionate husband, and faithful friend. During eight or nine of the last years of Mr. Whitney's life, he was wholly unable to fulfil the duties of his office. Occasional assistance was had, and some movements made to provide for permanent preaching ; and in No vember, 1812, Mr. Whitney affectionately addressed his people on the necessity of their having another minister, and offered to release half his salary to facilitate the settlement of a colleague pastor. The town and church joined in giving a call to the Rev. William Bascom, to settle with them ; but for some cause, nothing further was done in the matter. Candidates were afterwards hired. At length, August 14, 1815, both the town and church voted to invite Mr. Samuel H. Tolman to become col league pastor with the Rev. Mr. Whitney, and proposals were made for his support. Mr. Tolman gave an affirm ative answer ; and on the 20th day of October, 1815, he was ordained. Mr. Tolman's ministry was neither long nor so accept able, as was to be desired. Being strictly Calvinistic in 47"], [400, "370 SHIRLEY. his views and doctrines, neither the senior pastor nor a majority of the people, were pleased or edified by his administration. One of the deacons, John Heald, and a daughter, left the church, and joined a Methodist church in Lunenburg. Finally, difficulties occurred in raising money to pay Mr. Tolman his salary; and on the 31st day of January, 1819, he asked the church, that his rela tion to them as pastor might be dissolved. The church assented, and an ecclesiastical council was mutually chosen, which convened on the 17th of February, 1819, and with deep expressions of regret at the necessity, and with a high recommendation of Mr. Tolman, dismissed him from his duties as pastor and minister. The Rev. Mr. Tulman was afterwards settled in the ministry at Dunstable, and subsequently at Merrimack, New Hampshire. During his short term of ministry at Shirley, fourteen persons were added to the church, thirteen children baptized, and five marriages celebrated. After Mr. Tolman's dismission and Mr. Whitney's death, the first parish and church were destitute of a settled minister for fourteen years. A due organization was, however, maintained, and occasional preaching, for a great part of the time, was hired. At length, in June, 1834, the Rev. Seth Chandler was engaged for one year; at the expiration of which, he was re-engaged for a longer period ; and on the 5th of November, 1836, he received a call from the church and parish, to become their pastor and minister. He gave an affirmative answer to the invitation, and on the 14th day of December, 1836, was regularly ordained by an ecclesiastical council, and still remains in office. The first settled minister over the Universalist society was the Rev. Mr. Jacob Wood. He was installed, January 1, 1818, and preached five or six years, when he left, and removed to Shrewsbury. A church was organ ized under Mr. Wood's administration ; but after his"], [401, "371 MESSRS. STREETER, BROWN, EATON. departure, the ordinances were discontinued. In the year 1S29, the Rev. Russell Streeter removed from Watertown to Shirley, and without any formal induction to office, preached to the society about ten years, when he removed to Portland. Since the remodeling of the meeting-house, the Rev. Isaiah A. Coolidge, from Framingham, has been their minister. Another church has been organized, or a revival of the former one has taken place, under the administration of Mr. Coolidge. The first minister ordained over the Orthodox society, was the Rev. Hope Brown. The church, of which he was pastor, was organized, February 3d, 1828, and con sisted of sixteen members ; but no legal religious society was formed, until 1846. Mr. Brown was ordained, June 22, 1830, and continued their minister till March 26, 1844, when he was dismissed. He removed to Napierville, Illinois, where he is settled over a society. July 6, 1847, Rev. Joseph M. R. Eaton was installed over this society. He had been previously ordained at Clintonville."], [402, "CHAPTER XXI.

The first inhabitants of Shirley were not lacking in the general spirit of liberty, which prevailed in their time, nor in men capable of expressing their views, in energetic language. Their instructions to their representative in the General Court, in October, 1765, were as follows: \u2014 \" Ordered, That Abel Lawrence, Esq., representative for us and others in the Great and General Court, have a copy of our views ; and he is desired to conduct accord ingly.

It is therefore thought, by your constituents, that at this critical season, you would not be unwilling to know their minds upon this important affair. We look upon said act as a burden, grievous, distressing, and insupportable, not only likely to enslave the present, but future generations.

We are far from saying or acting anything whereby we might be charged with disloyalty, as subjects to the best of kings, or that we have not a proper sense of the power of the British court; but we do think, that our charter privi leges, and natural rights, as the freeborn sons of Britain, are infringed upon by said stamp act. Our advice, instruction, and direction, therefore, to you is, that upon all proper occasions, you use and exercise your utmost endeavors and strongest efforts, in a modest, respectful, and becoming manner, to prevent said act from taking place in the government ; and that you, with a watchful eye upon every occasion, diligently guard and protect the liberties of your country, to the utmost of your power, against all encroachments and innovations whatsoever.

On the \"Boston Port Bill,\" the following action was had: \" At a town meeting holden January 18, 1775, it was voted, that we make some provisions for the suffering poor, in Boston and Charlestown, on account of the Bos ton port bill, so called, and that the same be done by subscription.

It is uncertain whether any school was kept in the territory of Shirley previous to its separation from Groton. The first record in relation to schools is under date of May 30, 1757, when it was voted to have a school three months, to begin in August or September. For many years there was but one school in the district, and that is said to have been kept at the house of Jonas Longley, now owned by Andrew J. Reed. As popula tion and wealth have increased, schools have been multi plied, aud convenient school-houses erected, so that the accommodations for common school education is at least on a par with other towns of its size and population. The town is divided into six school districts, exclusive of the United Believers, or Shakers, who manage their own school. Each district is provided with a convenient school-house, one on a new and improved plan ; seven or eight hundred dollars are annually raised for the support of schools, affording each district about three months' schooling in winter, and the same in summer. Since 1843, the whole management of the schools has been under the direction of the town, which has placed the districts more on a state of equality than formerly, when 48"], [408, "378 SHIRLEY. each district managed and paid for its own house and schooling. The following persons are known to have entered col lege from Shirley, viz., Nicholas Bowes Whitney, John Dwight, Daniel Parker, Leonard M. Parker, Rufus Long ley, John Spalding, James O. Parker, John Dwight, Thomas Edwin Whitney and John Edgarton."], [409, "CHAPTER XXIII Soil\u2014 Productions \u2014 Streams of Water\u2014 Manufactures\u2014 Provision for Paupers. Shirley contains a variety of soil, common to this part of the country. Moderately elevated hills, vales, inter vales, plains, and bog or peat meadows are interspersed, all under proper cultivation, capable of yielding abundant harvests to reward the laborer's toil. A large portion of the inhabitants subsist by industriously availing them selves of these natural advantages. Indian corn, rye, bar ley, oats, potatoes, hops, hay and garden Vegetables are the common products of the farms. Streams of water and eligible sites for mills, of various kinds, abound in Shirley. Nashua river lies partly in the territory, and forms the easterly boundary of the town for a considerable distance. Squannacook river forms the northeastern boundary of the town from Townsend line to its junction with the Nashua. Mulpus brook, (said to have had its name from a Frenchman in Lunenburg by the name of Mulipus,) rises in Lunenburg and flows into the Nashua, a little above the mouth of the Squannacook. Catacoonamug brook, or river, rises also in Lunenburg, consisting of two small streams, which unite in the south part of Shirley, and it falls into the Nashua near the southeast corner of the town. On the Nashua river, within the bounds of Shirley,"], [410, "380 SHIRLEY. there is but one mill seat. This has long been occupied by a grist-mill, saw-mill, and paper-mill. Having in no season any lack of water, and the Fitchburg railroad passing by its side, this is a valuable privilege, capable of much enlargement in business ; owned and improved at present by Mr. Eli Page. The Squannacook being the boundary line between Shirley and Groton, has several valuable mill sites ; but hitherto the improvements of them have been upon the Groton side. Mulpus, to within about half a mile of its mouth, is comparatively a dead stream, affording no advantages for mills ; thence is a continued fall to the Nashua, interrupted only by the many dams erected to make use of the water in its descent. First, it drives the wheels of the carding manufactory and fulling-mill of Mr. James Wilson ; next, the saw-mill, shingle-mill, bark-mill, and grist-mill, of Mr. Jonathan Kilburn ; then, the waggon and wheel works of Harvey, Woods h Co. ; aud, lastly, another saw-mill, now owned by Mr. Jonathan Kilburn. But on the Catacoonamug, in the south part of the town, are by far the most extensive and most valuable manu facturing establishments. First, a waterfall, in the northerly branch, near the line of Lunenburg, occupied by a saw-mill and shingle-mill, and preparations for a paper-mill are being made, is owned by Mr. Samuel Hazen. A similar privilege on the southerly branch, just above the union of the two, is occupied by a cotton factory, owned by Mr. Hiram Longley. Another privi lege, just below the junction of the two branches, had, a few years since, a batting-mill thereon, which has been destroyed by fire. Below this stands a paper-mill, wherein paper is manufactured with great rapidity, under the modern improvements in that branch of manufacture. Farther down stream are a saw-mill and grist-mill, owned by Mr. Thomas Hazen ; a cotton factory, with 864"], [411, "381 MANUFACTURES POOR FARM. spindles, owned by Mr. John Smith, of Barre. Still lower down is the Fredonia manufactory, of 1,500 spin dles, owned by Major Israel Longley & Co., where are made 400,000 yards of cloth annually. As the Fitchburg railroad passes directly through this already flourishing village, offering a passage of only about two hours to Boston, three times a-day, it seems to promise to be a permanent place of much business. Shirley, as most other towns have done, has provided a farm and comfortable buildings, at which to support such as are unable to provide for themselves the neces saries of life. Until 1837, paupers were distributed amongst such inhabitants as would provide for them at the lowest rate ; a practice in many other towns. In that year, the town purchased a farm stock and farming tools, at an expense of about $3,700, at which this unfor tunate class of persons have since been comfortably fed, clothed, and lodged."], [412, ""], [413, "APPENDIX TO THE HISTORY OF GROTON. The following family lists of marriages, births, and deaths, are compiled from the records in the clerk's office in Middlesex county, the first two books of records in Groton, with some addi tions from private sources, where correctness could be relied upon. It is not pretended that the lists are complete, or any wise nearly so. Many families are undoubtedly wholly omitted, and omissions are more or less frequent in families which might seem to be complete. The marriages are more nearly complete than the births ; and the births, than the deaths ; and yet there are no marriages found on record from 1686 to 1706, except a few from Middlesex records, about 1690. Great care has been taken to put the dates precisely as they stand in the records. There are a few apparent inconsistencies in them, and probably some mistakes will be made, owing to the change of style in 1752. The inquirer may consult that part of the Preface relating to the change of style, for the best means to avoid error in this particular. The object of the compiler in giving this long Appendix is twofold ; to assist the genealogist, or any one wishing to trace his ancestry ; and to preserve the records of the town. The first two volumes of the town records, from which these lists are principally made, are so torn and shattered, that the lapse of a few years more would place them beyond the possibility of being copied. A volume of this publication may chance to be pre served till after the original manuscripts shall be no more.

Richard Sawtell's style, in each of these particulars, was very good, and very similar to the records in the county offices, made at and about the same period. His records prove him to have been a scholar. A similarity in the records of the next four succeeding clerks to that of Richard Sawtell, is discernible; though each of them appears to be much his inferior in scholarship. John Morse was a very distinguished clerk. More of his writings and copyings remain in the clerk's office than of any other one. His chirography resembles German text. His orthography, use of capi tals, and mode of expression, were uniform, consistent, and as correct as any of his time. The laying out of lands and highways, decrees and orders of the selectmen, with the usual transactions of the town at their public meetings, during the period of his clerkship, mostly remain in legible and intelligible form, though penned one hundred and seventy years ago. Thomas Tarbell, Sen., wrote in quite a fair and legible hand ; but his use, or rather nonuser, of capitals, and his orthography, were abominable. Take a specimen, selected at random. \" grotton march 8 1704 \" at a legul townmeting the town did yot that thay wul met for the futer to chus town offesurs the fust tusday of march annuelly \" thomas tarbell dark.\" Joseph Lakin's hand-writing was intolerably bad, and his spelling as incorrect as Tarbell's. For example : \" At a leagall townmeting being met chose Capt John Sheple to sarve for and represent them in the great and generall court and aseMbeley to be conuenied, hild and capt for his majesties servis at the court house in Boston this August currant 1721. \" Joseph lakin dark.\""], [492, "462 GROTON. The town records were not made or kept in any tolerable or decent style from the time of John Morse, 1682, till Abel Lawrence was chosen clerk, in 1757. He first recorded a warrant for a town meet ing, and introduced the practice, which was afterwards pursued. A. Lawrence, the two O. Prescotts, A. Bancroft, I. Farnsworth, S. Lawrence and S. Rockwood, wrote fair and legible hands, and their style of composition was for the most part good. De vivis nil dicendum est. REPRESENTATIVES IN THE GENERAL COURT. The first mention of a representative in the records of Groton, is about the time the charter of William and Mary was received, in 1791. The choice of representatives is not then recorded ; but receipts for their pay, and some other records, show that they were chosen. Copies of the records follow. \" Groton, April 12, 1693. Know all people by these presents, that John Page, Sen. doth fully and clearly acquit the town, selectmen and constables, for serving the town as a representative at the first [session] held in Boston in the year 1692.

The town voted to petition the General Court, \"that their representative might be released from attending the session any more.\" May 15, 1693. The town voted, \" that they would not send nor choose any person nor persons for to represent them in the General Court or Assembly.\" Oct. 30, 1693. \" Capt James Parker was chosen to represent the town at the Great and General Assembly held at Boston the eighth day of November ensuing.\""], [493, "463 APPENDIX. Notwithstanding the foregoing receipt of Dea. Nathaniel Lawrence, it appears the town was threatened with a suit by him for thirty-six shillings for his services as representative ; probably for a short period of service aster the town petitioned for his release from attending. Jan. 1693-4. The town voted not to pay Dea. Lawrence, and chose a committee to defend in any suit which might be brought by him. About this time he removed with his family to that part of Cambridge which is now Lexington. Whether a suit was commenced or not does not appear ; but ten years aster, May 17, 1703, the town voted, \" that they would pay Dea. Lawrence for money that the Deacon demands for serving the town as a representative in the year 1693 ; \" and also, \" to borrow the money of Thomas Williams for four months and pay one shilling interest for it for that time.\" An indication of great embarrassment, if not extreme poverty !

The first subject which divided the people of the United States into two great political parties, aster the revolutionary war, was the expe diency of a federal union of the then thirteen separate States under a national constitution. During the progress of measures to form such a constitution and frame of government as would be accepted by the people, and to procure its acceptance, the energies of the greatest, the wisest, and the most intelligent men in the nation were unremittingly exerted, and their exertions were barely successful. The names then appropriately applied to the parties for and against the proposed consti tution and frame of government, were Federalists and Anti- Federalists. At this period a majority of the people of Groton were anti-federalists, and chose two delegates, who in convention opposed the adoption of the constitution. The majority, however, was soon reversed. These party names, though correctly applied for the time, did not long designate the character of the parties. The Federalists were content with their appellation for some twenty or more years, but their oppo nents bestowed upon them the titles of aristocrats, monarchists, tories, &c, while on the other hand the Federalists stigmatized the Anti- Federalists as anarchists, jacobins, democrats, &c. The constitution and form of government adopted being truly and strictly republican, that name ought to have been adopted by all, and all should have united in supporting it in purity. But though appropriate, it is scarce ly used at present, except by foreigners. As different subjects of legislation and different measures of admin istration have in the progress of time occupied the attention of the people, different names and appellations have been assumed and be stowed by advocates and opposers thereof. Without naming others, Whig and Democrat have for some time been, and are now the names by which the parties are distinguished. Some of the prominent measures pursued and advocated by one party, by whatever appella tion known, including federalists and whigs, have been, building and supporting a respectable navy; encouraging commerce, agriculture, manufactures, mechanical arts, and internal improvements, by granting corporate powers to companies for the accomplishment of objects beyond the power of individual exertion ; providing a convenient and safe currency, and thereby enabling capitalists to engage in enter prises, which afford constant and lucrative employment for the labor ing classes ; establishing a judicious tariff, by which the expenses of government might be raised upon foreign luxuries, and at the same time encouragement given to the domestic production of necessaries 59"], [496, "466 GROTON. and conveniences ; and finally, maintaining peace with all nations. And the party favoring these measures have opposed building gun boats for national defence ; embargoes, non-intercourses ; embarrass ing derangements and restrictions in the currency ; and especially involving the nation in unprofitable, impolitic, destructive wars. The other party uniformly opposed what this advocated, and advocated what this party opposed. The degree or amount of patriotism possessed by each party has not probably been so unequal, as that of talents, education, intelligence, integrity ; but patriotism without these is comparatively of but little estimation. And abilities, capacity and knowledge are not held in such disproportion by them, as they would have been, but for that \" ruling passion,\" thirst for office, and for the facility of gratifying it by apostacy. The sentiments of the inhabitants of Groton on these subjects, so far as they are indicated by the character of those for whom they have given their suffrages, appear in the foregoing and following lists. In the lists of representatives, senators, &.c, the names of the anti-fed eralists and democrats are in Italics. VOTES FOR GOVERNOR. Fed. or Anti-Fed. Years.
