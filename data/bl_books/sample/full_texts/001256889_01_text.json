The persons and events represented in the following tragedy exhibit to the eye and the mind of the spectator many striking features of the social and political condition of Italy towards the close of the thirteenth century. Perhaps no other age and country ever presented so singular a combination of events, institutions and charac ters, as Italy at this time ; for it afforded examples of every variety of political organization, and every phase of social Use, near neighbours too, in actual contact with each other. At this period we see the Empire and the Church struggling for the mastery, and spurring on two embittered and warring factions, the Guelfs and the Ghibelines, arrayed for generations against each other, and maintain ing by battle, by intrigue, by treachery and assassination, the one party the divine right of the Pope, the other that of the Emperor. Under these rival claimants of supreme power, Italy was parcelled out among many subordinate princes and nobles, the hereditary lords of larger or smaller estates, intermingled with numerous Republican cities holding wider or narrower territories. Some of these cities were ruled by a caste of nobles, others by an oligarchical faction, others again by the mob ; while an ever-increasing number were controlled by some petty tyrant, who, by force or fraud, or both,"], [8, "HISTORICAL PREFACE IV had raised himself from the rank of citizen to that of master of the State. Although the feudal system had been introduced into Italy, it was never as fully established there as on the other side of the Alps ; and perhaps from this cause we find it, in Italy, in the closest neighbourhood, indeed strangely intermingled with the institutions of commercial republics, and often in contact with the most licentious democracy. For many of the lesser nobles were led by necessity, expediency, or ambition to connect themselves with these republics, becoming citizens of some neighbour ing city, yet retaining their rural possessions and their feudal manners. They often wielded great power in the state, although there sprung up amongst the true burghers an intense jealousy of their lordly fellow- citizens, who indeed gave them frequent cause of offence. These republics being often at war with each other, or with some neighbouring prince, the whole militia of the city had, at times, to take the field. But the state found its most skilful leaders and best soldiers among the nobles and their retainers, whose contempt for trade and me chanical and sedentary occupations led them to cultivate the more invigorating pursuits of rural life. Their devotion to the chase, their skill in horsemanship, and in the use of weapons, their love of warlike enterprise, coupled with the improvements in the armour and equipments of the man at-arms, gave to the nobles an acknowledged superiority over the townsmen, who were yet loth to tolerate their superiority in other respects. To such a height did this jealousy rise that at Florence, Milan, and many other places, the nobles were at times banished to their castles ;"], [9, "HISTORICAL PREFACE. V and one mode adopted of disfranchising a powerful or turbulent citizen was to declare him a noble, and dis qualified from holding office in the republic. Meanwhile the more warlike and enterprising nobles, recruiting the number of their followers, organized com panies of free lances, and made contracts for military ser vice with different states that were at war with each other ; at the termination of the contract freely transferring their service from one power to another, according to the de mand for troops, and the pay offered them, and, during the short intervals of peace, often maintaining their followers at free quarters on the country around them. Nothing can better indicate the divided and troubled condition of Italy, politically and socially, than the fre quent, and, in some cases, customary choice by the citizens of these republics of some foreigner to fill the post of Podesta, or governor of the city. He was usually a noble and a soldier, but sometimes brought with him one or more learned jurists to aid him in his judicial duties. This custom originated in a deep conviction that no man but a foreigner, born and bred far from the feuds and factions that convulsed the state, could be so free from partisan bias as to deal out impartial justice to litigants of every party. Another proof of the troubled condition of Italy was furnished by the numberless exiles scattered all over the country ; citizens, and chiefly distinguished citizens, ex pelled from their native city by some hostile faction : Guelfs by Ghibelines ; Ghibelines by Guelfs ; the Bianchi by the Neri ; the Neri by the Bianchi ; or else the victims of some more local quarrel. Thus the family and adherents"], [10, "HISTORICAL PREFACE. VI of the great baronial house of Delia Torre, which had often done good service to Milan, were expelled by that member of the Visconti family, who first made himself master and tyrant of his native city, and thus founded the great duchy of Milan. Such, too, at Rome was the result of the pro longed struggle between the great families of Colonna and Orsini, in which cardinals and popes became partisans. Near the close of the century, Cardinal Benedict Caietan, a bitter enemy of the Colonna, being chosen Pope (Boni face VIII. ), not only brought to bear against them his spiritual and temporal power, but entrapping them by fraud and treacher}*, confiscated their estates, and banished them from the territories of the Church. But this warlike family were not to be put down. At the head of com panies of free lances they continued to play conspicuous parts in Italian history, and re-established themselves more firmly than ever in their old strongholds in the neighbourhood of Rome. Some of the fiercest and most lasting of the feuds which troubled Italy originated in private and even family quar rels, which, after involving the immediate neighbours, spread to adjacent cities, and convulsed whole provinces. A quarrel between two of the Cancellieri, a powerful family of Pistoia, gave rise to the parties of the Bianchi and the Neri, which soon divided that city into two hostile camps. A well-meant effort of the Florentines to reconcile the parties involved Florence and all Tuscany in the feud ; and the mischief was not allayed, but aggravated, by the interference of the Pope, Boniface VIII. He had called Charles de Valois, the brother of Philip le Bel, into Italy, to place him at the head of an expedition he meditated"], [11, "HISTORICAL PREFACE. VII against Sicily. He now charged him to pacify Tuscany on his way, and gave him to understand that in States so rich it would be easy to repay himself for his trouble. The Republic of Florence dared not refuse the mediation of Charles. It was accustomed to regard the House of France as the protector of the Church and of the Guelf party. It, however, limited in precise terms the authority allowed him, before receiving him, with eight hundred cavalry, into the city. But Charles, making no account of the engage ment he had taken, at once formed an intimate alliance with the Neri. Having agreed on his share of the booty, he gave a loose rein to their passions, permitting them for several days to pillage and bum the houses of their enemies ; to kill those who were most odious to them ; to carry off the heiresses of rich families, and marry them to their sons ; and to procure sentences of exile and confisca tion to be pronounced against all the most illustrious families of the Bianchi party by the Podesta, a creature of Charles of Valois, whom he had brought there. The French cavalry and the Guelfs of Romagna, whom he had introduced into the city, assisted at all these outrages. Charles at length quitted Florence, carrying off immense wealth. His cavalry were loaded with gold and precious stuffs ; but he carried with him the curse of the Floren tines, which seemed to follow him in his unsuccessful ex pedition against Sicily. Two generations earlier a private quarrel in Florence had given birth to similar and more lasting evils. Cases of breach of promise of marriage are apt to excite keen interest. One occurred in Florence not to be soon for gotten. A young Guelf noble of the upper vale of Arno,"], [12, "VIII HISTORICAL PREFACE. named Buondelmonte, who had been made a citizen of Florence, demanded in marriage a young lady of the Ghibeline house of Amadei, and was accepted. While the nuptials were in preparation, a noble lady of the Donati family stopped Buondelmonte as he was passing her door, and, bringing him into the room where her women were at work, raised the veil of her daughter, whose beauty was exquisite. \"Here,\" said she, \"is the wife I reserved for you. Like you she is a Guelf, while you would take one from among the enemies of your Church and your race ! \" Buondelmonte, dazzled and enamoured, instantly accepted the proffered hand. The Amadei looked upon his incon stancy as a deep affront. All the noble Ghibeline families in Florence, about twenty-four in number, met and agreed that he should atone for the offence with his life. On the morning of Easter Sunday an armed party lay in wait in the house of one of the Amadei ; and just as Buondelmonte, riding on a white horse, and thinking it as easy a matter to forget an injury as to reject an alliance, had crossed the Ponte Vecchio, they rushed out upon him, and he was killed at the foot of the statue of Mars, a relic of paganism which still stood there. Well might Dante call the blood spilt here \" a seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race.\" Forty-two families of the Guelf party met and swore to avenge this deed. Blood did, indeed, atone for blood. Every day some new murder, some new battle, alarmed Florence during the space of thirty-three years. These two parties stood opposed to each other within the walls of the same city ; and, although often reconciled, every little accident renewed their animosity, and they again flew to arms to avenge ancient wrongs."], [13, "HISTORICAL PREFACE. IX The ferment of political and social commotion in which the Italians were living, far from checking, seems to have excited mental activity, stimulating inquiry, enterprise, and industry in all human pursuits. We now look back upon the thirteenth century as a period at which Europe had not yet emerged from the darkness of the middle ages. But already towards the close of this age a strong focus of light had been thrown upon Italy. What if many various-coloured and diverging rays, tending to deceive and mislead the eye, in its search after truth, were mingled with the purer light ? What age is free from refracting media and misguiding radiance ? Has this nineteenth century got beyond all such sources of error ? The century closed upon Italy in the midst of an era of intense political, commercial, and intellectual activity. War and diplomacy have seldom been more busy ; and what is known as Machiavellian policy had already been perfected generations before Machiavelli was born. Ex amples of every conceivable form of government were to be found in the land, from theocracy, as represented by God's vice-regent the Pope, to the fierce democracies of the commercial cities.. Every experiment in the organiza tion of republican government was on trial, or had been tried, with a success perhaps quite equalling that attained to in our enlightened age. In the year 1300 Dante was composing that immortal poem which laid the foundation of all modern romantic literature. The young Giotto was already painting, carving, and designing those works, noble in conception and execution, which laid the foundation of all modern"], [14, "X HISTORICAL PREFACE. art. St. Thomas of Aquinum, the greatest of the school men, had but lately passed away, after carrying to the highest point the subtilty of the human intellect. Marco Polo, the most renowned of travellers, returning home after spending half a lifetime in observant exploration of Tartary, Thibet, and China, was revealing to his countrymen the wonders and mysteries of those vast empires, so imper fectly known to us at this day. Italian merchants had established their counting-houses in every city in Europe and Western Asia, controlling the commerce of the world, and bringing the precious commodities of the remotest East, and the skilful productions of Italian factories and workshops to every market in Christendom. Italian capitalists, who, many of them coming from Lombardy, were all known as Lombards, were then the bankers through out Germany, France, and England ; and to this day that street which is now the financial centre of the world still retains their name. Throughout the kingdoms of Europe the florin of Florence was more current than the coin of the realm. Nor was commerce the only source of wealth and influence to Italy. It was the centre of the Christian world, and its chief city the seat of- the sovereign head of the Church. From Rome the Pope's lieutenants and agents, learned, acute, adroit, and sometimes devout men, were constantly sent forth to sustain and extend the papal influence at every court, in every city, castle, cathedral and monastery in Western Europe. Rivalling in amount the gains that rewarded the enterprise and industry of the Italian merchants and manufacturers, the contributions of the faithful flowed in a constant stream into Italy, foster-"], [15, "HISTORICAL PREFACE. XI ing industry, the arts, and luxury throughout the peninsula. We have given a hasty sketch of the condition of Italy towards the close of the thirteenth century, but must say that the events in Italian history are so multitudinous and complex that many chapters of it are very imperfectly known. In vain would the inquiring reader turn over the pages of well-known Italian historians in order to find an account of the persons and events we are about to exhibit to him. One short chapter seems to have been long lost out of the annals of Florence. But luckily it has been lately disinterred from among the literary rubbish of one of those religious houses, so summarily secularized by a government which does not believe in monks, nor perhaps in anything else. A careful study of this old MS. soon disentangled an interesting chain of incidents from the garrulous and somewhat confused narrative written in monkish Latin. Unlike the stubborn materials which fill most pages of history, this new-found matter would so obviously run readily into the dramatic mould, that it at once suggested the thought of presenting it to the spec tator in the form of a drama."], [16, "CHAEACTEKS REPRESENTED.

Its gentle tones outstrip the clamorous breath Of shouting crowds, and pierce the thrilling heart. When fair Bianca from her window gazed Upon Colonna as he rode beneath, A single smile he sought to crown his triumph ; But when this wreath his throbbing temples bound, His swelling heart confessed his triumph perfect ! Bian. A paltry favour. You embolden me To lay aside the maiden's bashf'ulness, Nor blush to thank the saviour of my country. Poor, empty thanks, but from a grateful heart \u2014 Colon. Thus would I be rewarded. Have I served The cause of Florence with adventurous sword ? Her fairest daughter smiles upon my deeds, And I am well repaid \u2014 Bian. Do you love Florence ? Colon.

You view my actions with too partial eye, And paint them brighter than their native hues. Is there no Florentine, who in the field Can guide his country's arms ? Or is it but The jealous eye of faction that o'erlooks Your bravest and your best ? Bian. Such once she boasted; they are now no more. To noble sires degenerate sons succeed, To peaceful arts and sordid gain devoted. Their dainty limbs disdain the rugged steel, The soldier's vesture ; and their torpid blood Would freeze within their veins, upon a bed Of mossy turf, the hardy warrior's couch. Or are there some whose bosoms cherish yet One spark of martial fire ? To rob the weak, And wreak their vengeance on a private foe, Comprise their valiant deeds. Colon. Yet some there are, who might escape your censure.

Impossible ; what plea For pardon can you urge ?

Can you ask For such offender pardon ? Second Noble. Let me urge His youth, his injuries \u2014 Colon. You sue in vain. I stand not here to play a puppet's part, The scare-crow of the law, to fright the timid, And be the while the scoff of bolder spirits.

Colon. Nor will I ever ! Unto you, Bianca, Within whose breast a lofty spirit towers Above your sex's weakness, I unfold My inmost thoughts. Think not I lack ambition ! Lofty ambition is the soldier's spur To each adventurous deed. And did I lack, In mine own breast, the ardour to pursue Ambition's glorious path, in you, I trust To gain a Mentor who can still arouse My drooping soul to renovated vigour. Bian. Your surest Mentor you will ever find In your own valour and heroic worth. Colon. Heed me, Bianca ; unto you I owe Full half my present power. 'T would gall my pride, So much to owe to any one but you. But willingly to you I owe my power, And, dearer yet, will owe my happiness.

Not so, why should we heed The sullen murmurs of a stingless crew, For ever scoffing at the power they dread. Not fear, but coldness makes you now to pause. You love me not. Bian.

Mark then my words, and own them groundless terrors. Upon a strong foundation stands my rule : The power and authority of luw, The zealous people's love, my trusty band, Who never knew defeat, sustain my fortunes. The commons love me ; even now they prate Of humbled nobles, and defeated foes ; Of victory, of plenty, and of peace ; And, as the source of these, they bless Colonna. Bian. You know not Florence and her fickle sons! Trust not the people's favour !
