This tragedy is presented as an earnest effort to tell in dramatic form the story of a young man of gentle blood who, in our own century, laid down his life for his native land. History is not wanting in such heroes, and Ireland has furnished many, but few present so many claims on the tender affec tion and admiration of mankind. Inwoven with the story of his pure patriotism is that of a love so true and touching that all the higher dramatic ele ments are there, waiting only the hand of art to arrange them. Robert Emmet was born in Dublin, March 4, 1778 ; he died on the scaffold September 20, 1803. Thomas Moore paid poetic tribute to Emmet, the friend of his youth, in some of the finest of his Irish melodies. Washington Irving immortalized the love of Sarah Curran in his \" Sketch-Book \" under the title of \"The Broken Heart.\" The Comtesse de Haussonville told the story of Em met's life to France in an exquisite monograph. The prose form has been chosen in the present work for many reasons. Chief among them is that no maker of verse could rise to loftier heights than Emmet himself in the prose of that marvellous"], [16, "PREFACE. VI speech in the dock which has become a classic of the language. Its great periods and its arrowy sentences may not be rashly broken to suit the needs of verse. It sets high the mark for all that can be written about Robert Emmet, his purpose, his love, and his doom. The author is much indebted to Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet, of this city, a grand-nephew of Robert Emmet, for the kindness with which he allowed a thorough examination of the rare collec tion of family documents, illustrations, and price less relics which he has gathered and which he treasures with such loving care. It has thus been made possible to present with this volume absolute reproductions of the originals of all the portraits of the young hero. The frontispiece is an artotype of the Comerford miniature which was sketched on a piece of brown paper during the trial and afterward tinted. This miniature was copied on ivory many years later, and all reproductions of this likeness hitherto made have been from the copy. The autograph under the miniature is reproduced from one of Robert Emmet's books which he used at Trinity College, Dublin. Most important, perhaps, of all are the sac-simile reproductions of the pencil sketches made during the trial by Petrie, the artist, father of Ireland's greatest arch\u00e6ologist. Here in the hasty lines the artist has caught the very spirit of the thrilling moment when, baited by the fierce judge, young"], [17, "Preface. VII Emmet stood, the embodiment of calm scorn and defiance. The drawn brows, the contracted eye lids, the curling lip, the folded arms, bring the awful scene before the eye with startling reality. Many drawings and prints have been made from this original, but none have preserved its spirit. The profile outline drawn on the same paper shows the young face in repose. The three seals which are reproduced in enlarged form have each a romantic history. Suffice it to say here that the design for the beautiful seal of the United Irishmen was made by Robert Emmet in 1798. It was cut with masterly skill upon an emerald and is at present in the possession of a member of the family. The seal of Thomas Addis Emmet was cut upon a large rock crystal, and was worn by him in prison at Fort St. George. The seal of Robert Emmet, cut upon a white carnelian, with its willow tree bowed by the storm, its harp of the breaking strings, and its legend, \" Alas, my country ! \" was worn by him on the morn ing of his execution.
