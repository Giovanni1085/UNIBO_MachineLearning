Enter, from the supper room of the Emperor, the Senators Caius Mur\u00e6na and Antonius Piso. C. Mur. What think you, friend ? A. Piso. Methinks indeed 'tis strange To see the Emperor of the world belch out, Between two cups of wine, a ribald song. And, like a pitiful harper for some gain, Twanging his harp, while wanton courtesans In attitudes lascivious stand around And seek to inflame the passions of the Prince. Then strewn on couches round the banquet table Lie senators, who, fearing for their lives, Do franticly applaud the imperial song : Yea, senators of old patrician houses, At mention of whose names in reverent times The greasy mob off-capped !

The vulgar crowd Jeer unrestrained when they perceive their Prince Come, like a common player on the stage, Decked out in tinsel, with a harp in hand, Soliciting applause ! And are they wrong ? No, it doth pass endurance ; it cannot last. The time must come when at imperial crimes, Each day repeated, the public gorge will rise, And stomach them no longer. C. Mur. A change must come, And to the Emperor's profligate career A check be put ; for what man here in Rome, Of any note whatever, holds in his hands Assurance of his life ? We live in dread ; A whim that passes through the Emperor's mind May fix our deaths. The common people, too, Will bear the yoke no longer ; every morn We hear of witty tales or scurrilous jests Scrawled on the Emperor's statues in the night, That round the city fly from mouth to mouth, And all the people laugh ; and yet the Prince, Fearing the populace, seeks not to find The authors of these things. A. Piso. 'Tis even so ! But stormy clouds are gathering all around, Will shake the imperial fabric to its base. C. Alur. You've heard the news from Gaul ? A. Piso. That 'tis reported The legions there are threatening to revolt, And that the Spanish legions have displayed A discontented spirit ; if 'tis so, The imperial forces that are sent to quell"], [11, "Scene I ] THE EMPEROR'S WISH. 3 The spreading insurrection will soon find How serious is the work they have on hand. The issue is most doubtful, for 'tis known How much the natives in the provinces Abhor the imperial power. They from the hands Of cruel governors have suffered much, Who pillaged them and harrowed all the land, Seeking by every means to raise more taxes Wherewith the Roman treasury might be filled. And with this money, thus extorted from them, The Emperor gives the Roman populace Such shows of wild luxurious costliness, As turn their thoughts away, and leave him free To execute what hideous crimes he likes. C. Mur. Galba, who now commands the legions camped In Northern Italy, should be here to-night ; For by the Emperor's orders has he been Recalled to Rome. 'Tis whispered here and there That Galba is no longer to be trusted ; He waits to see what turn events will take. A. Piso. You think he'll come? 'Twere rather dangerous To place himself within the Emperor's power. C. Alnr. I think he'll come, because he feels assured His legions, who adore him, would avenge Whate'er might here befall him. 'Tis now eight years Since he incurred the Emperor's displeasure, Was sent to take command in distant parts ; And since that time he has not been in Rome. Now that the imperial power seems to be Upon the verge of changing hands again,"], [12, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH.

But look, here comes Messala, ever grave, His brow o'ercast with heavy melancholy. Enter Valerius Messala. A. Piso. Good-even to you ! What sad news bring you, That gives your features such a solemn cast ? V. Mess. 'Tis nothing, sirs ; I do not feel quite well, And when our health is dull, our spirits too Take an infection. Has the Emperor supped ? C. Mur. He still prolongs the revel. Hark, the sound Of distant music and the noisy shrieks Of drunken bacchanals ! And at this time The provinces of Gaul and Spain revolt, And, as the latest messenger brings word, Declare the Emperor traitor to his country, Depose him, and proclaim him parricide, And to be punished by the Roman law, Which says he shall be sewn up in a sack And thrown into the Tiber ; yet we see The indolent Nero gambling precious time, And scoff at fortune.

We do not know ;"], [13, "Scene I.] THE EMPEROR'S WISH. 5 But if 'tis true that he is here in Rome, 'Twill not be long ere he presents himself To ask the Emperor's orders. Is he alone ? V. Mess. I know not. But look ; who comes this way ? A Piso. Surely 'tis Galba with some officers ! 'Tis eight years since I saw him ; how he's changed ! Enter Galba and some Officers. V. Mess. Galba, my friend ! Gal. Valerius, is it thou ? Why, then, the gods look favourably on me Sith they thus send old friends to greet me first. Shake hands, Valerius ; and you, and you as well. C. Mur. We offer you our welcome back to Rome. Gal. Much thanks again ; but tell me now, friends, my Where is the Emperor? A. Piso. At supper still, In yonder room ; but when the meal is done, 'Tis probable that he will pass this way. Gal. Then here I'll wait, and when he passes by Present myself. Valerius, come aside, And while we are waiting for the imperial presence Tell me the state of feeling here in Rome. What think the people of the adverse news Come from the provinces ? I who have breathed Provincial airs for nigh upon eight years, Have but a hearsay and uncertain knowledge Of public feeling and of public talk In the imperial city. No one hears us.

If the rebellion in the provinces Meets with success, dost think the Emperor has Sufficient trusty forces here in Rome Wherewith he might reconquer Gaul and Spain ? Can he rely on the Pretorian guard ; Or could they by judicious means be brought, Together with the Senate and the people, To acclaim as Emperor of the Roman World Some conquering and successful general ? V. As ess. Galba, beware ! In the imperial palace, Walls may have ears ; 'tis wiser not to speak On subjects of so dangerous a nature. Be careful, Galba ; thou art not safe in Rome. Nero did never love thee, he fears thee now ; Be therefore on thy guard. But now no more ; The Emperor comes. We shall speak more anon. Enter Nero, dressed like Orpheus, crowned with flowers, and with a lyre in his hand, followed by Dolabella, other Women, Senators, Pomponius, Silanus and Guards, Phaon and some Slaves. Nero. You did not half applaud ; I strained my voice And played my lute with such Orphean skill, Had touched the hearts of beasts and senseless things.

Oh, that the Roman people had one neck, That I might strangle it ! Sila. The Roman people Worship their Emperor ; think not ill of them. Nero. Away, you foolish man ! It is not true. The Roman rabble hates me \u2014 yes, I know it. They by their silence urge me from the stage, And, when I drive the chariot in the circus, With coarse and grating voices loudly back The adverse party ; the senators meanwhile Sit with their vacant faces, nor make attempt To save me from this shame. What use are they ? The people scorn them ; and they trembling sit, Dreading to do their duty and protect My name from insult. Am I not still Their master and the Emperor of the world ? They let my statues in the public places Be every night soiled with the public ordure. I'll have no senators more. I'll have them thrown Into the Tiber, every one of them. What man is that ? A Sen.

This will I do. I'll show you, sirs, that I know how to rule, Know how to make my imperial power felt. Does Galba laugh ? Am I not Emperor, then ?

Nay, Dolabella, though the charms be great That lure me to thy couch, yet will I wait Till they shall bring me here these prisoners. I'll show men what I am. I've thoughts in my head.

Let him go ; Bid him be gone from here. So long he stays, So long he spoils our mirth, Nero. Galba, you hear ? My Dolabella's mirth is spoiled by you. Beware my wrath if you annoy my girl. Gal.

Bring me a cup of wine ! Be quick and bring it me, that I may drink To Galba's zeal ere it has time to cool. Gal. You doubt my words ? What proof, then, shall I give That I am well disposed ? V. Mess. Be wary, friend ; Put seal upon thy lips, if thou art wise. The Emperor's in a dangerous mood to-night. Nero. To Galba's zeal ! To Galba's zeal I drink ! May it not disappear as quickly as The wine I quaff, nor in its nature prove As worthless as this fragile bowl of glass. [Nero throws down the bowl. So much for Galba's zeal ! Here come the felons. Enter Gaolers with Prisoners. Bring me a seat ; I will now sit on judgment. Let all the felons draw up nearer to me, That I may scan their faces. I will be Severe, but just.

Off with his chains, and set him free at once. I order it ; the Emperor says the same. Nero. Well, be it so. Let him not come again Within my reach ; he'll not escape next time. Prisoner.

What crimes are there that thou hast left undone ? Murders innumerable ! To give thee sport, Hundreds have lost their lives in the arena. Thou hast murdered men that thou mightst seize their wealth. Thou hast snatched their wives from humble citizens, And turned them into strumpets ; and the cries Of their young daughters, ravished, have been heard Re-echoing through thy halls.

But I have no experience of the world ; I never had much contact with mankind. Under my father's care, away from men, I grew up as a solitary child. Ne\u00e6. Where, lady, were you born ? Von. Up in the mountains. My father from the Emperor had obtained Grant of a little farm, for he had served In many wars, and had obtained the rank Of a centurion. Ne\u00e6. And where lay this farm ? Von. In a remote and lovely wooded valley High in the Apennines. There was I born, And there my mother died ere I had reached An age to feel the loss, and so I waxed To maidenhood a solitary child. Ne\u00e6. How was it, then, your husband found you, lady ? Von. It was a lovely night like this, Ne\u00e6ra."], [33, "Scene I.] THE EMPEROR'S WISH. 25 So shone the rising moon along the vale. We heard a tramp of hoofs upon the road, A knocking at the gate. Valerius entered With his attendants ; they had been belated And sought by us a shelter for the night. 'Twas granted, and we served up what we had, The produce of the farm. As was my wont, I waited on Valerius at the table. His eyes fell upon me ; mine looked at him. I spoke no word ; he thanked me for my pains. Oh ! a strange feeling overcame me then ; I felt a different woman from that night. The morning came, Valerius still stayed on ; He did not leave that day, nor yet the next ; And when he left he did not leave alone, But we went forth together, man and wife. Look yonder, how the evening star shines bright, Outbidding his compeers. Ah, methinks It is the eye of God, that from on high Looks down upon ourselves ! Our prayers to him. Thou bright and golden star, whate'er thou art, With thy benign and precious influence Shine down on me, and listen to my prayer. Where'er my husband be, watch thou o'er him, And let not harm approach, nor yet dull care ; Let him be cheerful, but thou turn his thoughts Sometimes towards me, as mine are turned to him. Oh star ! sweet star ! send him soon back to me. Hearest thou no noise, Ne\u00e6ra ? Ne\u00e6. No, nothing, lady. The night is very still, nought stirs outside. Von. Hark ! hark ! I hear it now again. What's that ?"], [34, "26 THE EMPEROR'S WISH. [Act II. Ne\u00e6. 'Tis like the sound of hoofs upon the road. Von. Then 'tis Valerius, who returns to me. Run, girl ; call all the slaves to meet the master. It is his voice. Enter Valerius Messala and Galba. Valerius, welcome home ! How art thou, love ? What stranger hast thou brought ? I did not notice him. V. Mess. Be not afraid, Dearest Vononia ; 'tis an old friend of mine. His name is Galba. Be thou kind to him ; He comes to stay a day or two with us. Von. Whatever friends my husband has are mine, So welcome, sir, and may this house be honoured Since it now shelters such a noble guest. V. Mess. He is indeed a very noble guest, Vononia ; he commands the legions that Are stationed in the north of Italy. Von. So great a man doth come into our house ? Oh, sir ! excuse me if you think that I Did welcome you too coldly, but I lack All knowledge of the world, its manners, customs, And usages of rank ; it seems so strange To me to see a stranger in this house, For I have lived alone. Pardon me, then, If I did want in courtesy to yourself. Gal. One look so sweet, from such a noble lady, Were welcome for an emperor. Von. Come, Ne\u00e6ra, We must now go prepare a worthy room For this our noble guest So, sir, good night."], [35, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. Scene L] 27 Retain him not too long ; I love my husband. Good night, again. Come soon, right soon, Valerius. [Exeunt Vononia and Ne\u00e6ra. V. Mess. Is she not lovable, so pure, so true ? I would not lose her ; no, her gentle grace Illumines all my house : in Rome I leave What gloomy thoughts oppress me, here I am gay. Gal. Indeed she is a sweet and noble lady, Surpassing expectation. Were women all As pure and lovable as she appears, Methinks it were no folly then to love. V. Mess. Hast thou not loved, that thou art grown so cynic ? Come, Galba, now that thou hast seen my wife, Canst thou not understand why I do fear To join in a rebellion 'gainst the Emperor? Who, having such a precious thing to lose, Would run the risk to lose it ? He were mad ! Be wise, my Galba, and put up thy wrath ; Return unto thy legions now right soon : There thou art safe, the Emperor will not touch thee. But think no more to raise a civil war ; Its dangers are too great, success so doubtful. Thou underratest much the Emperor's might. We all do feel the tyrannous excess Of Nero's rule ; yet better 'tis to bear it, Than, having Nero slain, yet to ignore What will succeed him. Hast thou thought of this ? Dost know what will succeed on Nero's death ? I'll tell thee, Galba : chaos, chaos follows, Chaos and civil war, and in that chaos I Might lose Vononia."], [36, "28 THE EMPEROR'S WISH. [Act II. Gal. Thou dost instil Such hesitation into my mind that I Half dread the Emperor's power, and the thought Of unsuccessful issue weighs me down. I know not what to do. Ah, thus my plans Lag at the sight of hazards, and I lose My chance of empire ! V. Mess. Galba, be wise ; Tempt not thy fortune twice. Once thou wert saved When Nero had condemned thee unto death, Because a woman begged thy pardon of him. Then wert thou sent into honourable exile ; Thou even didst obtain commandment of Some distant legions 'cause she pleaded for thee. What woman hast thou now to plead thy cause Before the Emperor with success like this ? Be thou advised, thy project wild forswear. Remember that if failure it attends, Thou with thy life wilt pay the penalty ; And in the ruin of thy cause, likewise Thou draggest down thy partisans aud friends. Gal. What has become of Lais ? V. Mess. She lives near here, In a large villa that the Emperor gave her In her high days of fortune. Gal. Is it so ? Then I will see her. I loved that woman once. One night of love did she foretell to me I should be Emperor once. I'll go to her. V. Mess. Do so ; she is a woman of the world, and knows The Emperor's power, having been his mistress ;"], [37, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. Scene II.] 29 And having loved thee once, she will dissuade thee From enterprises rash. Thou art wearied sure ? Our ride was long ; let us retire to rest, And when the morning comes I'll point thee out The way to Lai's. Now, my friend, good-night. [Exeunt Scene II. \u2014 A room in the villa of Lais at Bai\u00e6. Lais at her toilet, attended by a Slave Girl. Lais. What weather have we got ? Is't warm or fresh ? Slave Girl. 'Tis warm and sunny, but the night was cool, Cloudless and clear ; there is much dew about. Lai's. Indeed much dew ; that is the reason why I felt it chilly in my bath this morning. I shiver still. Slave Girl. Lady, are you unwell ? Have you a touch of fever ? Fever lurks In many a villa garden here about. Were you this night perchance disturbed by dreams ? Lais. I never dream, I have no time for that ; I feel too tired, making love all day, Not to sleep well at night. How wearisome To hear the self-same men each day repeat The self-same adulations, and to watch The smiles that seem eternally the same Upon the self-same faces ! Slave Girl. But, lady, sure You need not see them if they weary you ? Lais. Not see them ! Hand me that mirror, girl ;"], [38, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. [Act II. 30 Let's see myself. Thou art not neat to-day ; Thou hast pulled my hair awry. It suits me not. Bring them thus o'er my forehead. Not see these men ! Although their presence may seem wearisome, I could not do without it ; 'tis grown a habit. How do I look this morning, tell me, girl ? Slave Girl. Most fresh and beauteous, lady ; think you not? Here is the mirror, see. Lais. I'll judge for myself. I doubt thy word, girl ; thou dost flatter me. Whenever this same question I do ask, Thine answer is the same. Mine eyes are dull. Is't weariness that makes them look like this ? Give me that stuff; I'll mark the eyebrows better, And tinge my eyelashes a deeper hue, \u2014 It makes the eyes look brilliant. 'Tis better thus. The lotion that I use to wash my face Keeps my complexion clear ; 'tis a good gift My friend Pomponius gave me. I'll thank him for 't. Ha ! there's a line that runs across my brow ! Girl, I am growing old ! Well, let age come, I dread it not ; it cannot bring much sorrow, Since youth itself has brought so little joy. That wrinkle's very marked. Ah, when I think How erst an Emperor would that forehead kiss ! Take, take this mirror from me, take it, girl ; I will not scrutinize my face too close. Go on, girl ; do my hair. Slave Girl. How shall 't be done ? Lais. Comb them well up behind, that I may show The nape of my neck ; I have it very fine,"], [39, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. Scene II.] 31 And therefore let men see it. So 'tis right. Now just a little lower o'er the forehead Let the hair droop. Enter a Slave. Slave. A stranger waits without And asks to be admitted. Lais. What his name ? I do expect some friends, but not so early. Slave. He will not tell his name. Lais. He will not tell ? Go, girl, and see who's this mysterious stranger. [Exit Slave. Slave Girl goes out and returns. Well, who is it ? Slave Girl. I do not know the man. He will not tell his name, but says he knew you, And therefore seeks admittance. Lais. He seems bold. What manner of man is he ? Slave Girl. If I may judge By his external semblance, nobly born, Imposing, valorous, of great position, Nor gay nor sad, but serious. Lais. What his age ? Slave Girl. Nor young, nor old, perhaps some fifty years. Lais. Bid him come in ; I'll see this curious man, Who's neither gay, nor sad, nor young, nor old. Enter Galba. Are you not Galba ? Gal. Ay ; eight years ago"], [40, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. [Act II 32 Thou hadst not asked that question. Lais. Oh, thou art changed ! Gal. Eight years do leave a mark where they have passed. Lais. Draw nearer, Galba ; let me look at thee. Indeed thou art changed ; erst thou wert gay, But now thou seem'st so silent, sad, careworn, And by dark thoughts oppressed. What ails thee, Galba ? Speak ; tell me ; I did ever wish thee well. Why art thou come ? I thought thee far away, Commanding distant legions ; by what chance Art thou, then, brought this way ? Gal. To see thee, Lai's ; To ask thee thy advice, which shall decide The current of my life. Lais. Go, girl, at once ; Leave us alone, and when my friends are come, Let me be warned. Galba, we are alone. [Exit Slave Girl. It was thy privilege in former days To kiss me, Galba ; but forgetfulness Slips in with years. Wilt thou forego thy right ? Gal. Not for the greatest pleasures of this world, Or the imperial crown. Lais. Come, sit by me. Thou must have much to tell, since thou hast lived So many years away in distant parts. And hast thou had adventures ? My time is thine. I die to hear thee, Galba. What is that ? A ring upon thy finger ? Whose gift is it ? I never gave thee that. Gal. No, Lais, no ;"], [41, "Scene H.] THE EMPEROR'S WISH. 33 A cunning goldsmith carved this ring for me. Two women loved me once ; this ring I wear As a memento of the love they bore me. Lais. Two women ! Who were they ? Gal. Thou knowest well : The one thyself, the other thou didst know. What good their love did bring me, I ignore. 'Twas nigh my ruin. Look at this ring; It hath a hidden meaning. Lais. And must thou keep That meaning to thyself, or may I know it ? Gal. Look at the ring while I describe it to thee. Two serpents intertwining, carved in gold, Hold in their mouths the bezel of the ring, Wherein is set a dark green emerald stone Encircled by small brilliants. The meaning this : The twisted snakes \u2014 two women, whose bright eyes Did fascinate a man ; the emerald stone Doth by its colour jealousy denote ; The little diamond circle all around, That sparkles in the light so brilliantly, Doth represent the burning fire of love, Through which all human creatures must have passed Ere they can feel the curse of jealousy ; For without love there is no jealousy. See, these two struggling serpents with their mouths Grasp for possession of the precious gem ; Like them, two women once for a man's love Did struggle hard. Now mark me, Lais, well : Thou seest the costly splendour of this ring, Wrought by the d\u00e6dal goldsmith to attract ; Well, round its inner circle, writ in Greek, D"], [42, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. [Act 34 If. A motto runs, whose general meaning is : \" However fair the external semblance be, Corruption lies within.\" Dost understand Why I do wear it ? 'Tis to think of thee. Lais. Give me that ring. Gal. How can I part with it ? It is an amulet that brings me luck. Lais. Thou cam'st to ask advice, so didst thou say ; I'll give it thee, the ring shall be my guerdon. Gal. If thou dost long for it, then take it, Lais. Looking at thee recalls such dreams of love That blur the purpose that did bring me here, And make the words still linger on my lips. Lais. And is thy purpose, then, so hard to tell ? Or is its nature secret, delicate, Not fit for women's ears ? Speak out, my friend ; I will not blame thee much e'en should it be Some love adventure thou dost fear to tell. I am not jealous, Galba. Gal. Thou hast guessed wrong ; Love is a theme that I have long forsworn. What troubles me is a more weighty matter. Lais. Ah, what a mystery thou dost make of it ! Why didst thou leave thy legions to come here ? Gal. Hast thou not heard of the revolt in Gaul, Which is supported by the Spanish legions ; How they have publicly proclaimed that Nero Unworthy is to hold the imperial power ; That he hath proved a bitter scourge to all, And therefore should be now deposed forthwith ? I now alone, with my few legions, stand A bulwark 'gainst revolt. I go to Rome,"], [43, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. Scene II.] 35 To judge the state of things ; and there I see, Ay, see the Emperor Nero, 'midst a herd Of wanton courtiers, wassailing at ease In indolent carelessness, while half the world Pants for the moment to cast off his yoke ! What shall I do ? Come, Lais, thy advice. Lais. Kill Nero. Gal. Kill Nero ? And wherefore ? Lais. To make thyself the Emperor of the world. Art thou afeard ? Gal. Think of the dangers, Lais. Can I, the unknown leader of some legions, Raise a revolt 'gainst Nero with success ? What am I but a man almost proscribed ; In danger of my life ; ay, hiding now To escape the Emperor's wrath ? Lais. Did I not once Promise thee, Galba, that thou wouldst be Emperor ? Dost wish to make my promise turn out false ? Gal. Thou hast not thought upon the subject, Lai's ; Thou dost not see what dangers lie ahead, Or what impediments are 'gainst thy plan. Lais. Nay, no more words ; 'tis useless, my dear Galba. I see thou art afraid. I had not thought It was so hard a thing to kill an Emperor. Gal. Why dost thou press so much to have him killed ? What has he done thee ? Lais. Oh, thy mind doth wander ! Has Nero got a claim upon my love ? Gal. But, Lai's, canst thou give no reason why Thou urgest me to such a deed of blood ? Lais. I have no reason."], [44, "36 THE EMPEROR'S WISH. [Act II, Gal. Art in earnest, Lais ? Nay, thou dost play with me. Lais. Oh no, my friend ! By weighty reasons am I never moved, I merely act on fancies or on whims ; And such a whim, perhaps fantastical, Moves me to think that it would give me pleasure To see thee Nero kill, to make thyself An Emperor in his stead. Dost still resist ? Gal. Thy passions and thy actions, as of yore, Are unto me a riddle hard to read. Enter a Slave Girl. Slave Girl. The strangers you expected are arrived. Lady, shall they come in ? Lais. A moment, girl. Go, Galba, hide thyself in yonder room Till I dismiss these people. Be not seen. There thou art safe, and canst at leisure think O'er all the things we've spoken. I will yet Persuade thee to my plan, be thou assured. Gal. I am not easily moved, and to succeed Thou wilt have work to do. Lais. Well, more anon. [Exit Galea. Now, girl, I'm ready to receive my friends. Enter Pomponius, Silanus, and Calpurnius. Pom. Still at the mirror, seeking to improve Thy natural beauty ? Oh ! not yet quite dressed ! Why, friends, we should have hurried on the pace, Then had we seen the beauteous Lais rise Out of her bath, like Venus from the sea."], [45, "Scene II.] THE EMPEROR'S WISH. 37 . Lais. Still at poetic phrases. Welcome all. Ah, what a sleepy look is yours, Silanus ! What revel yesternight did spoil your sleep ? Sila. No revel, Lais, but a little feast I gave some friends, where every morsel served Was by the greatest cooks in Rome prepared. You should have seen the richness of the feast \u2014 The flow of mellow wine, the wealth of fruit Brought from the Afric shore, the fishes caught Along the Spanish coast and shipped alive That they their delicate flavour might retain Lais. Spare me the rest, I am not fond to know The number of the dishes. Well, I see Your meals are heavy, judging from your girth. Cal. The splendid feasts our friend Silanus gives Have left their mark on him ; they gnaw his wits, And give him flesh he bears not easily. Pom. That lotion I did give thee answers well, If I may judge by thy complexion, Lai's. Lais. Ay, so it does. Pom. Thou shouldst have sent for me. I would have shown thee how it should be used. Lais. Pomponius, dost thou think me still so young That I know not how such things should be used ? Pom. Look at Silanus, with his mouth wide open, And starting eyes, admiring all alone The statue of the garden-god Priapus. Lais. It pleases you ? Cal. Silanus, Lais speaks. Sila. I like the quaintness of that statue much ; If I may guess, it was a lover's gift. Lais. I do not keep a record of such things."], [46, "38 THE EMPEROR'S WISH. [Act II Who gave it me I have forgotten now ; Yet, surely he was liberal of purse. Sila. So are we all. Lais. Ay, on yourselves, Silanus. When did you last make me a pretty gift ? Look at that pedestal that yonder stands : It long hath sighed that it might bear a statue ; Bring a companion to the garden-god. Sila. The cost of statues is no trifle, Lai's. Lais. Have you no wealth ? Why, even now you said That you had sent as far as Spain for fish To serve up at a meal. Sila. And so I did. When will you sup with me ? Lais. Not till I see A statue on yon naked pedestal. Sila. I promise you a statue. Lais. Go at once. Take him, Calpurnius ; there's a sculptor lives At Bai\u00e6, who has many things for sale Of strange conception, quaint, original ; See he selects one that you think will please me. Good-bye, Silanus. Sila. Must I take my leave ? Lais. Follow Calpurnius now ; come soon again. [Exeunt Silanus and Calpurnius. Pom. Thou art not gentle with Silanus, Lais. Lais. He's gross, and therefore must be grossly treated ; He's rich, and therefore he must give to others. Where hast thou been, Pomponius, all this while ? Pom. In Rome."], [47, "Scene II.] THE EMPEROR'S WISH. 39 Lais. What news is there of Nero ? What does she now, the dark-eyed passionate girl ? Pom. While Nero revels, Dolabella rules. Lais. Bringst thou no further news from Rome than this? AYere thine ears closed to rumours of revolt ? Pom. Not hear them ? Why, they are the common talk Of all the town of Rome ! They are not slight, The troubles that break out in Gaul and Spain. Lais. And what say men in Rome will be the issue ? Pom. They dare not to express their hopes and wishes, The Emperor has too many spies about. Lais. And dost thou think that Nero will be able To cope with this revolt successfully ? Pom. I hold no views on riddles of this sort, But public rumour says that Galba holds The threads of the solution, since he commands The legions, stationed in North Italy, The only bulwark left that can prevent The spread of the revolt, and therefore he Was summoned back to Rome by Nero's orders. Lais. Is Galba now in Rome ? And is it thought He is a trusty servant of the Emperor ? Pom. A trusty servant ? Nay ; 'tis even said He meditates to have the Emperor slain, Whereby he might attain imperial power. Thou shouldst have seen the meeting of the two ; The want of courtesy on Nero's part, And Galba's efforts to restrain his wrath. 'Twill not be long ere one or the other dies."], [48, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. [Act II. 40 Lais. Dost really think that Galba is in danger ? Pom. I would not be in his place should he be caught And brought before the Emperor. He's fled from Rome. Lais. Galba has fled ? And whither is he gone ? Pom. I do not know, but generally 'tis thought Back to his legions. Oh, I had forgot That long ago this Galba was thy friend, Dost thou still take an interest in him, Lai's ? Lais. Take interest in him ? Oh dear no, Pomponias ! 'Tis but curiosity upon my part Makes me inquire what news there is of him. Pom. In talking thus my memory slips the noose. I nearly had forgot to tell thee, Lai's, That Nero has left Rome, and comes to Bai\u00e6. Lais. Nero is coming here ? Pom. Why so alarmed ? Thou lookest now quite pale. Does it give thee pain To meet again thy old imperial lover ? Lais. Speak not like that, Pomponius, or I'll hate thee. What brings him here ? Pom. The evil news from Gaul, Which so disturbs him that he has no peace ; He thinks that, having fled away from Rome, He will be less pursued by evil news. That which an Emperor hears not of, nor sees, Doth not exist for him. Lais. Leave me, Pomponius ; I wish to be alone. Pom. What I have said Hath dashed thy spirits ; is 't not so, my Lai's ? Lais. Press not to know ; I have my reasons for it."], [49, "Scene II.] THE EMPEROR'S WISH. 41 Come when thou wilt again, but leave me now. Pom. I see that thou hast something on thy mind Thou wilt not tell me. I'll not seek to know. Farewell, farewell ; we shall soon meet again, And be thou then in better humour, Lai's, [Exit. Lais. Galba must not stay here now Nero comes, I see that Nero's star is sinking low ; I feel 'tis over with him. Well, 'tis good ; He shall be punished for forsaking me. But now to work ; for I have still to bring The hesitating Galba to take part In this most dangerous venture. Ah, the prize Is great \u2014 an Empire ! 'Tis well worth the try ; The Empire his, the satisfaction mine. Thou dark-eyed Dolabella, thou shalt see It is not good to slip into my place. Come forth, dear Galba ; I am now alone. Enter Galba. Well, hast thou changed thy mind ? Gal. No, I'm resolved. I will not intervene to hasten on What doom for Nero in the womb of time Lies still obscured. I will now straight return Back to my legions, where I, unconcerned, Shall watch events slide into whatever groove Chance or the gods direct. Lais. Why so oppose Thine own advancement ? Take now mine advice, And lead the coming storm against the Emperor. It is for thee to choose ; make common cause With the revolted provinces."], [50, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. [Act II. 42 Gal. Nay, nay, Plead thou no more ; however sweet thy tongue, I'm proof to all temptation. Lais. Dost thou know That Nero comes to Bai\u00e6 ? Let him but put His hand upon thee, and thy life is gone. Gal. Nero is in Rome. Who says that he comes here? Lais. My friends who left just now did tell it me. Gal. Has Nero heard perchance that I am here ? Lais. They did not say, but they assured me that The Emperor did not love thee ; that the news Latest arrived from out the provinces Now in revolt was to the Emperor's cause Most markedly adverse. Gal. Did they say so ? Lais. And that it was the common talk in Rome That Nero's prospects were not enviable. Gal. We cannot ever ride upon the wave, We needs must sink sometimes into the hollow, But then we rise again ; so Nero will, Though now his fortune runs to a low ebb. Lais. They told me, too, 'twas commonly reported That thou hadst furtively fled out of Rome, And didst intend to march upon the city With all thy legions, and depose the Emperor. Gal. Mere idle chattering of the baser sort. Lais. They likewise said the Emperor, in his wrath, When he was told how thou hadst fled away, Did publicly decree thy death, and placed A price upon thy head. Gal. It is not true."], [51, "Scene II.] THE EMPEROR'S WISH. 43 He durst not do it. Lais. Ay, he dares it, Galba, Because he knows thou art afraid of him, And thus the man who has legions at his beck Swallows the taunts of him who scarcely keeps A tottering footing on the imperial throne. Gal. A price upon my head ! Does Nero seek To drive me to revolt ? Let the man come Who ventures to, when I am 'mongst my legions, And ask them for my head : he'll not return To get his Emperor's thanks. Lais. Boast not so much, For thy security is but apparent. A Nero has a hundred secret ways Wherewith to gain his end ; thou wilt one morn Wake up and feel thyself in throes of poison, While Nero laughs securely on his throne, \u2014 Ay, laughs indeed, that one should be so weak To choose to grovel when he held so near The reach of empire. Gal. There's much truth in this. A price upon my head ! 'Tis war, not peace, They urge me to. That narrows much the choice. Between extremes the present issue lies : Or peace, and that is certain death for me ; Or war, and that must lead to desolation vast And loss to others, death perhaps for me, \u2014 Ay, death most probable, but yet not certain ; And if success attend upon my venture, Why, the reward is great, an Empire.

[Act 44 II Wilt thou, then, have great power, wealth, thy life ; Or dost thou choose ignominy and death ? I had not thought it had required so long To think o'er the selection. Gal. When I think How Piso fared with his conspiracy, And ay, Vinicius too, why, then I lose All courage to proceed. Valerius is right. The Emperor's might is rated oft too low And made too slight of, and individual plots Lead to perdition only ; to breed success, It is the nation of itself must rise To cast away the yoke of Empire. Till then, let us in silence bear the burden For better and for worse ; for why should I Have better fortune in such enterprise Than Piso, richly circumstanced in all That should success betoken \u2014 birth, position, Noble of presence, stuffed with qualities, With wealth immense, and troops of powerful friends, Loved of the soldiery \u2014 and yet he failed. Nero but breathed a word, and Piso died. Lais. He's hesitating still. He must be forced To some decision ; words are no more of use. Hark, my dear Galba ; I'll not waste my breath Or strain my voice to hoarseness any more, To point thee out the way to Empire.

It is as good a method every way As argument, when the decision turns On doubts that balance close. Ho, there, my girl ! Bring me the dice that lie in yonder box. Now leave us to ourselves. [A Slave Girl brings the dice, and retires. Gal. What wilt thou do ? Lais. I pray thee, Galba, sit ; deny me not. We'll have a game at dice. Gal. And what the points ? Art thou informed in all the strokes of hazard ? Lais. It is my frequent game ; I know it well. Gal. What are thy usual stakes? Lais. At other times I pay my loss with liberties of love ; But when I win, the plenitude of gold Fills up my purse. But we this time must play For stakes of greater value. Gal. What are they ? Lais. These are fair dice ; thou needst not look at them. They bear not at their edge the weight of lead To make them tumble on the winning points. Gal. Tell me the stakes. Lais. Well, then, we will begin.

Talk not like this, Thou mak'st me angry. Who directs the dice If not the gods ? Have I not given thee grounds Should have persuaded thee a hundred times? But now, because thou hesitatest still, I make direct appeal unto the gods. Gal. Be not thou angry, Lai's : I will do As thou dost bid me ; thou shalt direct my course For good or evil. I will now throw the dice, Let them decide my fate. What if I win ? Lais. Then I renounce all efforts to prepare Thy way to greatness ; thou needst not then revolt, But at thy leisure wait till Nero kills thee. Gal. And if I lose ? Lais.

Pom. The Emperor says he cannot sleep at night ; I have, then, a proposal that may suit.

So, if we cannot for ourselves decide, Nor have that gift of resolutions quick, Dost thou not think that it were wise to leave Decision unto chance, or make appeal To clearer-sighted unconcerned outsiders? Once doubts removed, decision being ta'en, The aim appears distinct, and we proceed With impulse unrestrained along our path, And overcome what hindrances oppose The grasp of power. V. Mess.

Rome is lost ! And after Rome the Empire will follow ! Nero. Peace, peace, my Phaon ; trouble me no more. Have I for fourteen years ruled the whole world To be afraid of Galba's noisy legions ? Oh no ! Oh no ! For empires are not lost Nor are they won in a day ; and mark you all, I am the Emperor, and so long I live"], [80, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. [Act IV. 72 There will not be another.

Thou wilt bid him hither send the wife he keeps Hidden so carefully ; I wish to see her. Into my closet go, and there thou wilt find A golden goblet carved : take it with thee ; It is my present to her. Use fair words, And let Silanus and some others keep Thee company on thy way. Do not delay. Pom. And if Messala should refuse to place His wife into our hands, what shall we do ? Nero. Refuse ! Refuse ! Didst thou, then, say refuse ? I did not think of that If he resists, Tell him it is the Emperor's wish that she Who is his wife should come along with you. He'll not resist. Pom. And shall he likewise come ? Nero. No, no ! He must not come. I will not see him. Tell him the Emperor much regrets to learn How poorly is his health ; bid him take care And not expose himself. Tell him, Pomponius, I'll send him a physician of great fame Will cure him of his ailment. Sila. (aside). Then he'll not live, And his fair spouse ere long will be a widow. Nero.

Slaves preparing a banquet Enter Galba and Messala. V. Mess. The day goes by, the midday hour is on. And yet no message from the Emperor comes. Gal. Thou hast a look of weariness about thee Makes me uneasy. Art thou unwell, Valerius ? V. Mess. My hopes and fears kept me awake night, And I to-day feel not in wonted health, But weak and spiritless. All night methought I heard the last words that the Emperor spoke Ring in my ears : \" I'll see her soon again ; Let not thy slaves play too familiar with her ; \" And so all night, between the two extremes Of great despair and hope unreasonable, My mind swayed to and fro. Hour after hour In agonizing slowness seemed to pass ; And with the dawn I rose, and found my mind Unsettled, and no resolutions fixed ; And yet to-day I must decide to take My stand with thee in thy attempt to grasp Imperial power, or here lag behind"], [82, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. 74 [Act IV. And wait in patience for the Emperor's pleasure. And thou, my Galba, at so grave an hour Art still so calm ? Gal. Because I do not let My thoughts to wander or again consider Whether 't is wise or right to raise revolt Against the Emperor ; once decision ta'en, I hold no doubts or fears but work my way Straight to mine aim. Although I know full well That death's the penalty that I must pay If failure shall attend me, yet we soldiers, Who day and night are ever facing toils, Dangers, and death, unknown to such as stay In slumbering ease at home, are not thereby Rendered morose in humour, nor do we find Less relish in our food than other men. V. Mess. Thou hast that boldness in thee will succeed ; And yet how vast and great the Emperor's power ! Galba, I must stay here, come now what may. Thy hands are free ; if thou dost lose thy life Who will stand up and blame thee ? Thy friends will mourn, But they have got no claim upon thy life. If I should die in such an enterprise When not by circumstances forced thereto, And leave Vononia here, who would protect her ? I cannot take Vononia to the wars : Here must I stay until the civil war That thou wilt raise breaks out on every side ; Then, if I see no hope, we'll die together. She shall not live alone, to be the prize Of the first passing soldier."], [83, "THE EMPEROR'S WISH. Scene II.] 75 Gal. Canst thou not flee ? V. Mess. There is no fleeing from the Emperor's power, It doth extend too far, and his great hand Fetches the compass of the civilized world ; What lies beyond, barbaric hordes inhabit ; No man who has lived in Rome could yonder live. Galba. Thou art not wise, Valerius, to stay here, How canst thou hope the Emperor will forget What passed last night ? Select some trusty slaves And bid them take Vononia to some place Where she may hide secure, and thou wilt come Along with me when I to-night must leave To join my northern legions once again. V. Mess. No place is there where I could hide Vononia Securely from the Emperor if he showed Desire to possess her ; and thy war Against the Emperor will last many years \u2014 A Roman Emperor falls not in a day, And thou wilt have much stubborn fight to win ; How could I, then, be separated from Vononia for so long ? Then there's the hope That in the turmoil of a civil war The Emperor may forget me. Gal. Thou art deceived In putting trust in Nero. Has he shown Propensity to good ? V. Mess. There is no man So sunk in evil, so depraved in thoughts But he has still an inkling of some virtue ! The day draws on, and yet no sign is there"], [84, "76 THE EMPEROR'S WISH. [Act IV.

Perhaps I'll live Still many years in happiness with Vononia, The Emperor pardoning me for hiding her. If yesternight I called him to thee cruel, Oh, I maligned him ! He is not so bad As men have thought him, and he yet may do Some good deed ere he dies. And thou, my Galba, Who art bent on wars, ere thou must leave my house, And we perhaps may never meet again, We'll have a banquet and we'll all be gay, Talk over happier times in store for us When my Vononia and myself at ease, Not fearing ought nor hiding any more, Shall keep an open house for all our friends. A Slave enters. What hast thou got to say ? Slave. We have just seen A company of men riding this way. They must be close at hand. V. Mess. Men riding hither ? Didst thou say so ? Oh, thou most heartless slave, Thou hast killed me with thy news ! All hope is gone ! Oh, Galba, Galba, condole with me, my friend ; Vononia now must die ! What help is there !

Pom. Greeting to you, Messala, from the Emperor. The Emperor holds you in such high esteem, That it hath pained him much to see that you, So notable and great a senator, Should keep your wife secluded ; therefore he Sends us upon a message to invite Your wife to Bai\u00e6.

Pomponius, oh, Pomponius, did you say That I must send Vononia to the Emperor ? Pom. It is the Emperor's wish that she should come. V. Mess. When must she come ? and must I go with her? Pom. You must not come, Messala ; for the Emperor Regrets to hear how poorly is your health. He would not put you to an inconvenience, Nor take you from your house when you are ill. You are pale, Messala ! The Emperor will send His own physician to prescribe to you. V. Mess. Am I, then, mad ! Oh, by the gods above ! What's this you tell me ? Do I look so ill ? Pom. Messala, you are moved at what we tell you. V. Mess. Oh, not a whit, Pomponius ! not a whit ! Pom. Messala, you have done a foolish thing In hiding from the Emperor your fair wife ; Had you exposed her, he had passed her by Nor noticed her perfection. V. Mess. Say no more. Fie on the wisdom of this pandering slave ! Sila. See, there's a feast preparing, excellent, We shall not fast too long. V. Mess. You are welcome to it. Sila. And where is Galba; is he still with you? V. Mess. He is gone, ay, gone ! Silanus, had he known That you did wish to see him, he had stayed.

Now in your garden will we take a turn, And wait until the banquet shall be ready. [Exeunt all but V. Messala. V. Mess. Lost ! lost ! lost ! All, all is lost for me ! Oh, now no hope remains ! How can this world Give to one man such power of doing ill, And bear with it so long? To think, to think That if I let her go, perhaps to-night The Emperor's kiss may soil Vononia's lips ! It cannot be ! It must not, will not be ! And yet I see no means, but death alone, To save Vononia from indignities. To stab her ? No. Oh, it would make me mad, To see her blood flow from some gaping wound ! 'T would work me to a rage, that I would play Havoc around me, and thereby might lose My life, and with it hope of great revenge. The Emperor shall not live, if she must die. I do remember now : I bear some poison About my person, its action swift and sure, And also without pain. What if I should Pour it into her cup, and let her drink it ? She is so young and fair ! To die so young, And have to watch her die, 'tis fearful ! I will not have the strength to do this thing ; And yet 'tis better for her it should be done. Vononia comes.

Valerius, dost thou apprehend some harm Will come to thee from the Emperor ? Tell me, love I'll bear me bravely, and not yield to tears.

To bear thee hence, his messengers are come ! Von. Thou wilt not let me go, wilt thou, Valerius ? V. Mess. Beloved Vononia, did it depend on me Thou wouldst not go. But can I oppose The Emperor's orders ? Dost thou know, Vononia, What is the power of a Roman Emperor ? 'Tis vain to oppose his wishes ; and I so weak, So impotent against him. Oh, my beloved ! One way alone remains can save thee from The passionate lust of Nero, one way alone ; And thinking of it makes my heart sink low. The thought of losing thee kills me, Vononia, Von.

Those who do love intensely have their joy, And therefore is it balanced by the pain Of losing early that which they so love ; For did our joys take an unbridled course, We'd raise our heads with childish pride, and vaunt Our own poor selves as even with the gods. Valerius, we have drained the cup of love, So now, when sorrow presses close upon The heels of our departing happiness, Let us be patient, ay, and bow our heads, Nor murmur 'gainst the gifts the gods bestow ; For they are wise, and impious and vain Is it to struggle 'gainst the inevitable.

Give them no answer, for I am thine alone ! Thou art wrong if thou dost think to yield me up, E'en at the bidding of a Roman Emperor. V. Mess. Dost thou think so ? Vononia, dost thou know What, then, must be thy fate ? To die so young ! Von. Those who die pure feel not a sting in death. V. Mess. How calmly dost thou speak of death, Vo- nonia !

Thou must be wet Where hast thou been so long Pha. It is a fearful night, and fit to presage The fall of empires. Off, mine excellent cloak ; Thou hast had to buffet stoutly 'gainst the storm To keep thy master dry. Come, Ne\u00e6ra, And sit by me ; for on such stormy nights 'Tis pleasant to be seated close together. Ne\u00e6. I am so pleased to see thee here again. Tell me, dear Phaon, what has occurred in Rome To keep thee back so long ? Pha. Galba is come, And he this day has entered into Rome. He triumphs everywhere, and Nero falls. ATe\u00e6. What has become of Nero ? Is he dead ? Pha. I could not ascertain, although I tried. Terror and death are reigning now in Rome ; The city is abandoned to a crowd Drawn from the dregs of every trade, and swilled With the coarse lees of taverns ; with wild shouts And cries for blood and vengeance do they hunt For Nero ; and his friends and partisans, When they are caught \u2014 ay, woman, man, and child Are murdered without pity. Oh, 'tis fearful When passing down a street to stumble o'er The body of some friend that one has known ! Ne\u00e6.

It is the door, whose joints rough carpentered Are rattled by the wind. Be not afraid. What man on such a night, at such an hour, Would wander past our house ? Ne\u00e6. It knocks again ! Now I hear voices speaking. Open, Phaon. Phaon opens the door, and Pomponius enters. Pha. Pomponius ! Pom. Oh, Phaon, help thy master ! Exposed to the elements, he sits outside, His garments torn, no covering to his head, Soiled with the mud splashed from the horse's hoofs. 'Twas a mad ride from Rome ! Have pity on him ; Refuse him not the shelter of your house ! We are pursued. 'Tis over with the Emperor ; Let him not die outside as would a dog ! Pha. Pomponius, bring him in. [Exit Pomponius.

'Tis my last resting-place, I will not travel further. Did you hear, In the Pretorian camp as we rode by, Rising above the storm, borne by the wind, The noisy shouts of mine own soldiery Carousing in the night, drinking the health Of their new master, Galba ? My soldiers drink, While in a peasant's house I hide to die ! Dola. Think not of them ; they are but wretched men, Not worth thy thoughts. Nero. Bring me some drink. Pha. The house is poor, and we have got no wine. But here is water, fresh drawn from the spring. Nero. Give me the cup ; not oft have Nero's lips When parched been sated by so pure a drink. Look at my dress : the bushes we crept through To get as far as here have torn it quite. With thorns the envious brambles pierced my cloak And stabbed me, to the quick ; nature and man Conspire 'gainst me, to push me to my death. Dola.

Oh, that I had one day Of power left, then not a senator Would live to make decrees ! Oh, Nero, Nero, Dost thou still live in shame and in disgrace When near thee lie the means of a quick death ? Thou point of steel, thou hast a fearful look. Come, courage man ; is it so hard to die ? Pom. Fall not alive into the hands of Galba. Pha. Oh, let the last of C\u00e6sar's line fall nobly ! Sila. Wait not, great Emperor, till it be too late. Pom. You, who have been the master of the world, Be not led forth unto a felon's death Before the ribald multitude of Rome. Nero. There is still time, my friends. Give me a cloth That I may wipe my brow . Dola. Oh, my beloved, Be brave ! What terrors dost thou see in death ? Nay, rather fear to live, for canst thou wish To lead the life of ordinary men ? Thou hast lived an Emperor's life ; now power is gone, Die as an Emperor should. Oh, dost thou fear To die alone ?

SOCIALISM v. INDIVIDUALISM is rapidly becoming the most pressing, as it is the most momentous, question of the day.

It embraces a lucid statement of the views of Marx and Lassalle, the founders of German socialism, and a graphic des cription of the wild theories of Bakunin, the apostle of Nihi lism. Mr. Orpen has largely added to the importance of the work by giving the first comprehensive account ever published of socialism in England. He accurately describes and carefully criticises the three socialistic movements conducted by the Land Nationalisers, the Christian Socialists, and the thorough-going Social Democratic Federation, respectively. The book appears opportunely at a time when all Europe is astounded at the electoral victories of the Social Democrats in Germany. \" Unique and attractive.\" \u2014 Newcastle Chronicle.
