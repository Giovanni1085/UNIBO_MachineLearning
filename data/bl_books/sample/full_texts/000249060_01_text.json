This volume is intended to meet, in part, the inquiry for information respecting Ashan tee, and the countries upon the Gold Coast, which has been excited among the friends of Christian Missions, by the publication of the Journal ofthe Rev.

In common with others who have directed their attention to the subject, the writer has experienced the difficulty presented by the unsatisfactory state of the orthography of African names. Owing to the absence of some uniform rule, the name of a place is sometimes spelt differently by every tra veller who has visited it, or had occasion to mention it, \u2014 as in the case of Fomunah, a small frontier-town of Ashantee, which is written in no fewer than six different ways by five authors. In the instances where such confusion prevails, and where he has been able to ascertain the native pronunciation, the writer has spelt the names according to the rule followed in the later works on the languages of Africa, and especially in the Vowrt?ukftes which have been prepared for the uses of the Niger Expedition.

The desirableness of a common standard of orthography being so obvious, the Mis- sionaries of the Society have been in- structed, in the formation of Grammars and Vocabularies, to adopt the Italian sound of the vowels, and to give to every consonant one unvarying sound, as in the following scheme : \u2014 a, to be sounded as in father ; e, as in there ; i, as ie in field ; o, as in more ; u, as in flute ; ai, as i in time ; au, like ow in how ; g, always hard, as in get ; j, always soft, as in jet ; ng initial, as heard in ring ; ch, as in church ; hh, marks a strong aspirate ; and ou is an initial diphthong which, when combined with i, sounds nearly as the English word we, when articulated with the lips drawn together, and pro jecth^ag though the speaker was prepar ing to whistle. It is not, however, calculated that this scale will sufficiently express all the vowel sounds used by the natives. The orthoepy of their languages undoubtedly includes A 5"], [16, "PREFACE. X also the short vowel sounds ; as heard in hat, met, pin, pot, and but ; and it will therefore be desirable, that Missionaries and others, who attempt to reduce African languages to writing, should specify at least those instances in which the use of the short vowel sounds are indispensably necessary. Such cases will occur as in ponkor, the Ashantee and Fantee word for horse. If a Missionary or other visitor were to sound the o long in this word, as in more, he would fail to make himself understood by the natives. J. B.

Africa ; and, so early as the tenth and eleventh centuries, various causes, among which war and emigration were the principal, had contributed to the establishment of many Mohammedan king doms, or States in which the Mohammedan popu lation was numerous and influential, in the regions through which the Niger rolls its course. Letters and science, which flourished among the Arabians during the dark ages of Europe, at tended their footsteps in Africa ; and some of the kingdoms which they formed there, appear to have enjoyed a considerable degree of civilization. The glory of those earlier states was, however, eclipsed by the superior splendour and power of Timbuc too (Tumbuktu). That celebrated place, the very name of which, in later times, has operated with a kind of talismanic effect on the lovers of African enterprise, was founded in the beginning of the thirteenth century; (the year 1215 is specified by the Arabian writers ;) and the military prowess of its inhabitants, and its facilities for commerce, ere long elevated it above all its competitors. After various unsuccessful struggles with its rising power, all the surrounding states and kingdoms became tributary to Tumbuktu. About this period, that portion of the pure Negro race which could not brook the Moham medan rule, took refuge in the forests of that part of Africa which lies to the south of the vast moivn-"], [31, "3 CHAPTER, I. tainous range known by the appellation of the Mountains of Kong, and has there maintained its independence to the present day. Dupuis found, on conversing with the followers of the Prophet at Coomassie, (Kumasi,) that they as cribe the check which has thus been given to the spread of their rebgion, to the want of political concert among the Mohammedan states in the interior, and the absence of that energy which distinguished the career of the Arabs. Had it not been for the operation of such causes, they are persuaded that tribes of true believers would not, as is now the case in Ashantee, (As-hanti,) and other states, have been found in subjection to Heathen princes, to whom they are obbged to pay tribute, and whose battles they are compelled to fight ; but that every nation, dowu to the sea coast itself, long ere this, would have been con verted to the service of Allah. These causes are not, however, sufficient to account for the security of the Heathen Negro nations, seeing they suc cessfully fought for and estabbshed their inde pendence when the power of the Arabs and their auxiliaries was at its height. Their forest-retreats sheltered them from the cavalry of their enemies, with which, having no similar force of their own, they were unable to cope in the open country ; and since, by means of the trade established with Europeans on the coast, they became possessed of b 2"], [32, "4 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. fire-arms, they have, without difficulty, defended themselves against Mohammedan invasion, and have kept possession of the territory whose pre cious mines have ever proved the object of most eager desire. Aware of the superiority which fire-arms confer, they have never allowed the trade in muskets and powder to extend into the interior; which is therefore limited to a very scanty supply of those articles, brought by the caravans that cross the Great Desert from the north. The precise period of the foundation of the Ashantee (As-hanti) kingdom cannot be ascer tained, partly owing to the circumstance, that the Ashantees do not possess any written records; and partly arising out of the fact, that to speak of the death of a former king, as well as to inquire concerning the successor of the reigning sove reign, is regarded by them as a treasonable offence. Bowdich mentions a tradition, that the Ashantees emigrated from a country nearer the water-side ; and states, that Osai Tutu, who is said to have conducted the emigration, built Coo massie, and founded the Ashantee monarchy, about the year 1700, the period when Bosnian and Barbot mention the Ashantees as just heard of by Europeans. Dupuis, however, who paid considerable attention to the subject, traces the traditional history of Ashantee, as a separate king-"], [33, "5 CHAPTER I. tlom, backward for, at least, two hundred years, and states that both the Heathens and Moslems are agreed tbat the tribes of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) Gaman, Denkera, and Akim, were driven by the believers from their original inheritances, in the immediate vicinity of the Kong Mountains, to the forests of Wangara, the Mohammedan name for that part of Africa which they now possess ; and that they spread over the land, down to the mar gin of the sea, peopling, as may be conjectured, some countries which heretofore lay desolate, like the forests of Fantee, (Fanti,) and Assin, (Asin,) and others, whose primitive inhabitants were not adequate to the defence of their towns. He therefore concludes, that Ashantee is the parent country, and the stock from which the early gene rations of Fantees and Denkerans sprung ; and the account which Meredith has given of the origin of the Fantee nation is much more favourable to this conclusion, than it is to the opinion of Bow dich. According to that writer, the Fantees were originally an inland people, under the government of the kings of Ashantee ; against whom having rebelled, they fled towards the sea, and became an independent state. Another tradition is mentioned by Bowdich, which deserves especial notice, as furnishing evi dence of the relationship which formerly subsisted between the Ashantees and their neighbours."], [34, "6 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. He represents it to be the popular belief, that the Ashantee, (As-hanti,) Wassaw, Fantee, (Fanti,) Akim, Asin, Aquamboe, (Aquambu,) and part of the Ashantee nations, were originally compre- hended in twelve tribes or families, \u2014 theAquonna, Abrutu, Abradi, Esonna, Annona, Yoko, Inchwa, Abadi, Apiadi, Tchweedam, Aguna, and Dumtna, in which they still class themselves, without any regard to national distinction ; and that men of different nations, belonging to the same primitive family, on meeting, salute each other as brothers. The general correctness of this account is cor- roborated by Mr. Wilham De Graft, who states, that the chiefs of the several families are distin- guished by certain significant emblems, equivalent to the heraldic signs used in European countries. He himself is of the Chudan, (Bowdich's Tchwee- dam,) or \" tiger,\" family ; and he distinctly recol- lects old Baffu, a chief of the same family at Annamaboe- (Anamabu,) whose ensign of office (his umbrella) was surmouuted by a figure of the tiger. The emblems of the other families are, in bke manner, figurative representations of the names which they respectively bear. In conse- quence of intermarriages, the distinction between tbe families must necessarily, to a great extent, be lost ; but wherever it is still preserved, or is supposed to exist, the brotherhood is uniformly recognised. De Graft bas known his own father"], [35, "7 CHAPTER I. attend the funerals of individuals for the sole rea son, that they were members of the same original or patriarchal family with himself ; and when he resided, a few years since, at Dix Cove, he was informed, that, some time previous to his going thither, the king of Apollonia sent a present of rice to the inhabitants, when they were suffering from scarcity, as an acknowledgment that he and they were all members of the Inchwa, or \" dog,\" family. This latter fact shows that the tradition extends further than Bowdich was aware, Apol lonia not being included in the bst of nations which he has given. On another occasion, De Graft, being sent by the governor to pubbsh and explain a proclamation to the natives, was received with the greatest kindness by the chiefs of the Chudan, or \" tiger,\" family, who invariably, wher ever he met with them during his journey, which occupied three months, claimed him as one of their own relatives. After a careful comparison of the various accounts which have been furnished, it may per haps be concluded, that the Ashantees and their neighbours were originally a part of that great Negro emigration which withdrew, before the Mohammedan arms, from the neighbourhood of the Mountains of Kong ; that the Ashantees remained in that part of the country where they are now estabbshed; and that other tribes, per-"], [36, "8 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. haps at different times, and impelled by various causes, retired still further south, and settled in the country between Ashantee and the sea. With this general conclusion, it may not prove impos sible to reconcile the apparently contradictory tra dition mentioned by Bowdich. Under their early sovereigns, while the Arab influence yet existed on the Jobba, Kowara or Quorra, and Ghulby rivers, the Ashantees, although firm and compact as a nation, were unsettled in their habitation ; and the seat of government was removed from place to place, until it was permanently estabbshed, by Osai Tutu, at Coomassie ; which place he enlarged, (not built, as Bowdich supposes,) and raised, from an inconsiderable town, to the rank which it now enjoys as the metropobs of the empire. Now, as Bequa, last mentioned by Dupuis as one of the places where the government had been occasion ally held, is fifty miles to the south of Coomassie, it is no great stretch of the imagination to sup pose, that Bowdich's tradition respecting the emi gration of the Ashantees, under the direction of Osai Tutu, from a place nearer the water-side, is nothing else but a confused and exaggerated account of the last emigration of the government from Bequa to Coomassie. Either in that trans action, or some other movement of the nation within the territory which bes north of Fantee, { Fanti,) the tradition most probably originated."], [37, "9 CHAPTER I. . From their earliest history, the Ashantees appear to have been distinguished by their mili tary achievements. In the former part of the seventeenth century, they, with their allies, were able to send into the field sixty thousand warriors, armed with bows and arrows, and a very few mus kets; and their courage and ferocity rendered them a terror to surrounding tribes. At that period, Ashantee (As-hanti) occasionally ruled, by its influence, over part of Akim, Asin, Qualm, and Akeyah. The warlike deeds of Osai Tutu occupy a very prominent place in the annals of Ashantee. On the eastern side he added to it Quahu, which he entirely subdued ; and a great extent of country on the west, beyond the Tando river. In the north-west, he reduced Gaman to the condition of a tributary kingdom ; northward, he carried his victorious arms beyond Banna, into the neigh- bourhood of the great mountainous range. Dupuis says, \"The auxiliary kingdom of Banna was the right arm of Ashantee in those days, and still is.\" In the south, he ravaged Asin with fire and sword, for some indignity offered by its monarch towards his person ; and conquered both Tofel and Denkera, and estabbshed over them his rule. The overthrow of Denkera was an event which excited a great sensation in the surrounding b 5"], [38, "10 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. countries. According to the Moslem records, referred to by Dupuis, the war with Denkera com menced in the year 1719, and was the first great campaign in which the believers were compeUed to unite their arms with the Heathen of Ashantee, Banna, Dwabin or Juabin, and other tributary States in the north : and Bosman, who wrote in 1721, represents the Denkeran war as having ended but a few months previous. From this writer it appears that Denkera had assumed so much on account of its power and wealth, that it had become the object of hatred to all its neighbours, who impatiently desired its downfall; although no nation was hardy enough to attack it, until it was invaded by the king of Ashantee. The occasion of this wai' illustrates the customs and manners of the people of those countries. Bosiante, the king of Denkera, a young prince who had obtained a high character for valour, sent some of his wives on an embassy to present his respects to the king of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) who honoured them with courteous treatment and many presents ; and shortly after returned the compli ment, by sending a number of his own wives to assure the king of Denkera of the great esteem which lie entertained for liis persou. One of these was seduced by Bosiante, which so incensed Osai Tutu, tbat be determined to wash out the scan dal with the blood of the offender. Bosiante"], [39, "11 \u25a0CHAPTER I. offered him several hundred marks of gold as a compensation for the injury, which he indignantly refused ; and began to make preparations for war, by raising a strong army, and purchasing large quantities of gunpowder on the coast. The Den kerans, either through fear or some other cause, allowed his agents to carry the powder through their own country. While he was thus engaged, Bosiante died ; but the preparations for war con tinued, and the king of Ashantee at length brought a powerful army into the field. Two dreadful battles, in which one hundred thousand warriors perished upon the field, decided the fate of Denkera. It took the Ashantees fifteen days to collect the spoils of the victory which they had won ; and Bosman says, \" that one of their European officers, who was sent after the battle on an embassy to the king of Ashantee, saw the immense quantity of gold which he had reserved as his own share of the treasures won from the Denkerans.\" Gold did not, however, satiate the conqueror. The body of Bosiante was disinterred, and the flesh, having been separated from the bones, was given to be devoured by serpents, while the skull and thigh-bones were preserved as tro phies. These were to be seen at the Court of Ashantee when Dupuis was there ; and, although a century had elapsed since the conquest of Den kera, still the Ashantees, on their solemn days,"], [40, "12 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. continued to repeat their insults to the rebcs of its king and principal men. The Denkerau war is only briefly adverted to by Bowdich, in his \" Historical Notice of Ashan tee;\" but he states that the king of Denkera, (Intim Dakari,) the successor of Bosiante it may be presumed, was so considerable a trader in slaves, that the Dutch governor- general paid him a \" monthly note \" from his own purse, and assisted him against the Ashantees, with two or three small cannons, and a few Europeans. The cannon were taken by the conqueror, and placed as trophies at the top of one of the streets in Coo massie, (Kumasi,) where they remained when the capital was visited by Bowdich. The Rev. Mr. Free man also saw them on his late visit to Coomassie. The death of Osai Tutu shortly followed the subjugation of Denkera. If the other States, bor dering on the coast, wished for the downfall of that haughty power, Akim seems to have had a just apprehension of the rising greatness of Ashantee, and to have been impressed with the importance of keeping back so powerful an invader, and of preserving the equilibrium of the respective na tions. It therefore joined Denkera, and lost thirty thousand men in the two fatal battles in which the latter was overthrown. But its mis fortunes did not end here. Osai Tutu led liis victorious army into the Akim country, defeated"], [41, "13 CHAPTER I. the king in a great battle near the frontier, and reduced him to the necessity of suing for peace. This was granted, on the condition that he should become a tributary to the Ashantee crown, and should also defray the expense of the war by a present of two thousand bendas (four thousand ounces) of gold ; and two Akim caboceers of high rank were compelled to take Fetish, and were debvered up as hostages for the fulfilment of these conditions. Owing either to the insincerity of the king himself, or the discontent of his principal men, the contribution was not paid; and Osai Tutu, im patient at the delay, and urged by the reiterated complaints of his rapacious captains, raised an other army, which he sent against him, pur posing to follow when he had visited the royal sepulchre at Bantama. Accordingly, having pre sented the usual offerings to his tutelary deities, at that sacred place, he followed the army, accompanied by the flower of his nobility ; but before he could join the main body, he was sud denly attacked by a superior detachment of the enemy, as he was crossing the River Prah. On the first discharge, it is said, the king was wounded in the side ; but he threw himself out of his hammock, and rallied his men, when a second volley was fired from the forest, and he fell dead upon his face in the river. In the midst of the"], [42, "14 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. confusion which ensued, the enemy issued, sword in hand, out of their concealment, and massacred the whole party, amounting to two or three hundred persons, including sixty women and children belonging either to the king or to the nobles by whom he was attended. Thus ended the life and reign of Osai Tutu, whose qualities in the cabinet and in the field secured for him the epithet of the Great. Although he did not, as Bowdich supposes, lay the founda tion of the monarchy, yet he so extended the boundaries and increased the power of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) that he may justly be considered as its second founder. Dupuis evidently regarded him in this bght ; for he says, \" He created an empire, including tributaries and albes, which was strictly of a feudal complexion, by the union of all those kingdoms and principalities between the sixth and ninth degrees of (north) latitude, and between the fourth degree of longitude west from the meridian of London and the River Volta.\" To the excellences of this monarch the Ashan tees still advert with a national satisfaction. They say, he was the Good, as well as the Great ; for, in his reign, justice was ever on the alert, and the claims of his subjects were hstened to without distinction of rank or title. After the death of Osai Tutu, the army, having taken terrible vengeance on Acromanti,"], [43, "CHAPTER I. 15 (the town which had harboured the enemy the night previous to their attack upon the king, and many of whose inhabitants were in the ambuscade which cut him off,) returned to Coomassie, without even the satisfaction of bearing with them the corpse of their lamented sovereign, for it was never recovered ; but they carried up a considerable number of prisoners, who were doomed to be immolated to his shade. Great commotion ensued in the capital : for the principal ministers of state had perished with the king; and before his successor was chosen, and new ministers were appointed, most of the conquered nations had renounced their allegiance to Ashantee. Osai Apoko, the brother of the preceding monarch, was called to the throne in the year 1731; and his victorious arms obtained for him a renown scarcely inferior to that of his illustrious predecessor. Asin, Akim, Denkera, and Bou romy, all bowed before him, and yielded to his sway. In his conquest of Akim, he first obtained possession of the celebrated \"Notes\" which after wards involved the British and Ashantees in war. He also invaded Gaman or Buntuku ; chased Abo, its king, as far as the frontiers of Kong ; there defeated him in a great battle, and reduced him to unconditional submission. In the latter part of his reign, Osai Apoko was obliged to fly from his capital before a dangerous"], [44, "ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. 16 conspiracy. He had introduced a new code of laws, and made various important regulations, which the chiefs regarded as an abridgment of their power; and, in defence of their endangered authority, many of them resorted to arms. The king, after endeavouring in vain to hold a kind of convention at Dwabin or Juabin, met, and entirely defeated, the rebels in the province of Akiah. This victory re-estabbshed his authority; but he did not long survive. He died suddenly, in the year 1742; and the dissatisfied nobles embraced the opportunity which this event afforded, to secure by pobcy the object which they had failed to accompbsh by arms. The hereditary or elective prince consented to revoke the obnoxious edicts of his predecessor, and restore the old con stitution, which guaranteed to all the principal officers of state, and generals, or captains in the army, a proportionate share of influence in the city, a political preponderance in the councils of the nation, and a princely rank in the provinces. The reign of Osai Aquasi, brother of the two preceding monarchs, was, like theirs, distinguished by war and bloodshed. The caboceers or nobles of Bouromy, Quahu, and Akim entered into a league with the king of Dahomy, who engaged to support them with an army, in order to enable them to regain the independence of their respective countries. Osai Aquasi, however, attacked and"], [45, "17 CHAPTER I. defeated them with great slaughter, in the vici nity of the Volta, which they had selected as the most suitable theatre of action, on account of its contiguity to Dahomy. The principal caboceers or vice-kings of Bouromy and Quahu were taken prisoners ; and shortly after, the vice-king of Akim, to avoid falling into the hands of the conqueror, blew up himself with gunpowder, together with many of his wives, children, and attendants. After this, the king of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) contrary to the advice of his most able coun sellors, determined to cross the Volta, and take vengeance on Dahomy. Having ravaged the country of one of the tributaries of that crown, he engaged the Dahoman army which had advanced to meet him, and one of the most sanguinary battles mentioned in the records and traditions of the country was fought be tween the two armies. On the morning of the second day, Osai Aquasi was preparing to renew the contest which the night had interrupted, but was arrested in his plan by some omens pro nounced by the priests to be unfavourable ; and when the Dahomans, who mistook the inactivity of the Ashantees for want of resolution, came on to the charge, Osai Aquasi precipitately retreated to the Volta, without attempting any defence, and had the mortification to witness the destruction of"], [46, "18 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. a great part of his army, in consequence of the want of a sufficient number of canoes to transport them across the river. The Moslems, who were the informants of Dupuis, ascribed this terrible disaster solely to the superstitious fears of the Ashantees ; being persuaded that the resources of Ashantee were quite sufficient to have crushed to atoms the whole power of Dahomy. When the news of the defeat became known, the whole kingdom was thrown into mourning ; the pro vinces were ransacked for victims to be sacrificed in the capital, in expiation of offences imagined to have been offered to the national deities, and to appease the shades of the great captains who fell in the war; and the streets of Coomassie, during the whole of the Adai custom, \u2014 which custom, with other references to rebgious observ ances, will hereafter be explained, \u2014 were drenched with blood. The reign of Osai Aquasi was terminated by a wound which he received in a war with Banna. The crown now descended to another generation. The three preceding kings were brothers ; and Osai Kujoh was their nephew. This prince assumed the government in the year 1752, and was speedily in- volved in a war, acknowledged by the Ashantees to ha\\ e been the most critical aud hazardous in which they were ever engaged. It originated in the re fusal of some of the dependent States to pay the"], [47, "19 CHAPTER I. arrears of tribute which the new monarch claimed. The king of Gaman having set the example of disobedience, Osai Kujoh twice led his army against him, but was each time defeated with im- mense slaughter. This is ascribed to two causes ; first, that the enemy were armed with muskets as well as the Ashantees themselves ; and, secondly, that they were aided by a strong cavalry force from Kong and Ghofan. After each defeat, the Ashantee sovereign returned to Coomassie to offer sacrifices, and consult the national deities ; and, encouraged by a favourable response, he advanced a third time upon Gaman, and amply revenged his two former repulses. He led back to his capital a multitude of prisoners, of whom the children were spared alive to recruit the losses which his army had sustained ; and the adults of both sexes were either sacrificed, or sent to the great slave-market at Mansu, and sold into West- Indian slavery. Wassaw, another of the rebel- lious provinces, experienced even a more terrible visitation than Gaman. The incensed king let loose the fury of his soldiers upon its northern confines, and several large districts were entirely depopulated. The principal insurgents were im molated upon the altars of the capital, and two powerful tribes were removed from their native seats, and placed in distant provinces of the empire."], [48, "20 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. The defeat of Gaman and its allies laid open the Sarem country to the conqueror, into which he advanced; and it might have enabled him, had it been fully improved, to carry his vic torious arms as far as Cape Palmas : but he con tented himself with receiving the ready submis sion of the kings and caboceers of those States which had previously sought the albance of Kong. The fame of Osai Kujoh reached other lands, and a friendly embassy was sent to his Court from Dahomy to announce the accession of a new sove reign. Only once before (namely, in the reign of Osai Tutu) had such a compliment been received from this formidable neighbour of Ashantee ; and Dupuis gives it as the opinion of the Moslems, that this latter embassy originated in the appre hension of the Dahomans, and their ally, \u2014 the sultan of Dogho, the same as Eyeo or Yarriba, to whom they are in some sense tributary, \u2014 that the king of Ashantee (As-hanti) might be disposed to carry his victorious arms into Dahomy, in revenge of the defeat which his predecessor had there experienced. The Dahoman ambassadors were received by Osai Kujoh in the most flattering manner ; public rejoicings took place on the occa sion in the capital and throughout the empire; and a splendid embassy was sent in return to the Court of Dahomy to reciprocate the feeling of"], [49, "21 CHAPTER I. kindness and good-will on the part of the king of Ashantee. According to Bowdich, this Prince was distin guished by other qualities as well as valour, having by his policy succeeded in reducing the number of the aristocracy; but the events of the latter part of his life prove what are the qualifications most esteemed in an African monarch. Being obliged, by the infirmities of age, to confine him self to his palace, his enemies circulated a report that he was dead. This at once threw the distant provinces into commotion. Asin, Akim, and Aquapim, again rushed into rebellion ; and when the king sent an embassy, enjoining them to preserve the peace, they killed the messengers, and, in contempt of the aged king, threatened to march to the capital, and place one of their female slaves upon the throne, who would be able to repress disorder and sedition, which his impo tence could not accomplish. Vigorous prepara tions for war were then made ; but -before the army took the field, the king died. Osai Quamina, who succeeded his grandfather, Osai Kujoh, in the year 1781, vowed that he would not enter the walls of his palace, or see his wives, until he had obtained possession of the heads of Akombrah and Afosu, the two principal leaders in the rebellion. The vow was strictly performed ; and the skulls of the two ill-fated"], [50, "22 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. chiefs found a place among the trophies which are preserved in the palace of Coomassie. This prince, also, was honoured with a congra tulatory embassy from Dahomy, and received similar flattering testimonies of friendship from other states ; but his reign did not terminate in harmony with the eclat of its commencement. He was deposed by his subjects, in consequence, according to Bowdich, of his absenting himself from his capital, for the purpose of enjoying the company of his favourite mistress, a daughter of the king of Dwabin. Dupuis, howeve., ascribes his dethronement to his manifest attachment to the Moslems. His innovations, it is said, alarmed the great captains, who feared that the Moham medan religion would be introduced, and that they should in consequence lose their ascendancy. The Moslems might, however, be mistaken in sup posing that the captains were so much afraid of the levelling power of the Mohammedan rebgion. As the innovations of the king consisted in the suppression of various religious customs and festi vals which had the sanction of ages, it is far more probable that his detlironemeut was suggested by the superstitious fears which those proceedings had awakened. Osai Apoko, the second of that name, the brother of the fallen monarch, was chosen as his successor. He ascended the throne in the year"], [51, "23 CHAPTER I. 1797, and reigned, Bowdich says, a few weeks; Dupuis, two years ; which latter term was short enough for the transactions in which he took a prominent part. At the instigation of Kong, the Buntukus or Gamans again took arms, professedly with the design of effecting the restoration of Osai Quamina ; and the flames of war raged most fiercely during the period of fifteen months. The entire force of Kong, and of Gaman, crossed the Tando, and gave battle to the king. As his army was not one fourth so large as that of the invaders, he was unable to resist their advance. Their cavalry spread over the open plains of Massy, but could not penetrate that intricate mass of forest in which Coomassie (Kumasi) stands. At length the king was joined by the princes and caboceers from the distant provinces; and then, ceasing to act upon the defensive, he gave battle to his enemies in the open plains. After a tremendous conflict of seve ral days, he entirely defeated them, with prodigious slaughter, and returned to his capital, laden with spoils. In this war, the Moslems resident in Ash antee (As-hanti) were compelled to join the army, and fight against their own brethren in the faith in the ranks of Kong and Gaman ; many thousands of whom were found in the multitude of captives whom the king led back to Coomassie. It is, however, worthy of remark, that the Moslem pri soners were neither sacrificed nor sold into slavery."], [52, "24 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Many of them redeemed themselves, or were ran somed by their friends ; others were set at liberty when their sultan sent an embassy to Coo massie ; and the remainder were induced, by the kind treatment of the king, to remain in Ashantee, and were incorporated with the Moslem tribes which are settled in the northern provinces of the empire. In a few months after this victory, Osai Apoko, who was regarded as one of the most promising princes who had ever been raised to the throne, died of a bngering illness, which the Ashantees regarded as the effect of sorcery, practised out of revenge by his dethroned brother. Osai Tutu Quamina, the prince whose name is so intimately identified with the history of British affairs in Guinea, now ascended the throne. He was the brother of the two pre ceding monarchs ; and commenced his reign about the year 1800, when, according to the Moslems, he was only a beardless boy. Bowdich supposes he was about seventeen years of age. Young, however, as he was in years, his deeds speedily proclaimed the manly qualities which he possessed. Soon after he assumed the government, he was cabed to take the field against the united forces of Ghofan and Ghobagho; which had defeated the tributary king of Banna, destroyed Banda, his capital, and carried off a great number of"], [53, "25 CHAPTER I. captives. The advance of the king of Ashantee (As-hanti) checked theh progress southward. After a fierce engagement, which took place between the two armies, near the town of Kaka, the invaders retreated, until they were joined by a large body of reserve ; when they again offered battle to the king, who had vigorously pursued them. The entire defeat of the invaders was the result. Beaten at all points, they fled precipitately towards the Volta ; with the loss of one hundred thousand warriors, who either perished in the field, or were taken captive by the conqueror. Among the prisoners were two kings; one of whom, the Moslem king of Ghofan, died of his wounds, in the Ashantee camp. This victory gave the conqueror possession of a considerable territory on the north of Banna, to which the crown of Ashantee (As-hanti) had previously only a slender claim. This account of Osai Tutu Quamina's first campaign, which Dupuis had from the Moslems, receives a striking confirmation, in its main fea tures, from the narrative of the captivity of Abu Bekr, as given by the Rev. G. C. Renouard, in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society. Abu Bekr was the grandson of an alkaid of Tim buctoo (Tumbuktu) ; but he removed from that city to Jenneh when he was only two years old. When about nine years of age, he went to Ghdnah, c"], [54, "26 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. to visit the burial-place of his father, who had then been dead about five years ; and he remained in that neighbourhood until he was taken prisoner in war, and sold into slavery in the West Indies : from which he was released by the kind interven tion of Dr. Madden, in the year 1834. In the following extract, Abu Bekr narrates the circum stances in which his captivity originated. Refer ring to the period when he was residing with his uncle Mohammed, in the city of Ghdnah, he says, \u2014 \" At this time we heard the news of the busi ness of Adinkarah, sultan of Buntukii, after the sultan of Bandah, or Inkoransa, who was named Afwa, had been killed. They say, Adinkarah wished to kill Kujoh, governor of Kolongzhwi; a town belonging to the sultan of Ghdnah. He wished to kill him, because of what had happened between him and Dikki, his deputy, [who had been killed by Kujoh]. Adinkarah, therefore, wished to put the latter to death by way of retaliation. Adinkarah, sultan of Buntuku, sent to Kujoh, requiring him to pay a great deal of gold as a ransom for his life, and Kujoh sent what he required; but he refused to accept it, and said to Kujdh's messenger, ' Return to thy master, and say to him, Unless thou increase it by two hundred times as much, I will not accept it ; but my 6word shall take his head from off his"], [55, "CHAPTER I. 27 neck : thou shalt die a swift death.' When this messenger came to his master, and told him these words, Kujoh stretched out his hand, took back the gold, and kept it; and, likewise, sent a messenger to the sultan of Ghdnah to tell him what had happened. \"Then was Adinkarah very wroth; and he ordered all his captains to gather aU their soldiers together, and follow him, to make war against Kujoh, and to kill him ; that they might avenge the death of his servant Dikki. When the sultan of Ghdnah heard that Adinkarah, sultan of Buntuku, and his army, had come against them to kill them, he and all his host, together with Kujoh, rose up to meet them, and marched against them as far as the town of Boldh, choos ing to attack them there : and there they fought from mid-day till evening ; then they separated, and returned to their own places. Seven days afterwards, they again gathered themselves toge ther, and engaged in battle, at the town of Amvighdh. It was a hard-fought battle, and many souls perished on that day. Thus did Adinkarah overcome the lung of Ghdnah, and take the town of Amvighdh. The people of Ghdnah fled; and some of them passed on [as far as] to the city of Kong. \" On that day was I made a slave. They tore off my clothes, bound me with ropes, laid on me a c 2"], [56, "28 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. heavy burden, and carried me to the town of Buntukii; and from thence to the town of Kumasi, the king of Ashanti's town : from thence, through Askuma and Ajimmakuh, in the land of Fanti, to Daghdh, near the Salt Sea. \" There they sold me to the Christians ; and I was bought by a certain captain of a ship at that town. He sent me to a boat, and debvered me to the people of the ship. We continued on board ship, at sea, for three months ; and then came on shore in the land of Jamaica. This was the beginning of my slavery until this day.\" On comparing this statement with the preced ing sketch of Osai Tutu Quamina's first cam paign, it will be noticed that both refer in the first instance to Banda and Coransah, or Inko ransa; and speak of an overwhelming calamity which befell the king of Banda. In the next place, both agree that something like a drawn battle was fought between the hostile parties. And, in the third place, both concur again in stating, that, after some bttle time, a second desperate battle was fought, in which the warriors of the South gained a most decisive victory over their enemies. Various considerations show that these two narratives describe one and the same campaign. Abu Bekr was right in stating, that Adinkarah (or Dinkara) was then ruler of Buntuku or"], [57, "29 CHAPTER I. Gaman ; but that prince was not an independent sovereign. Both Buntuku and Banna were, at that period, dependencies of Ashantee (As-hanti) ; and Dinkara could not have sustained any other character in this war than that of viceroy or general of the king of Ashantee. That he would take a prominent part in the war, on account of his contiguity to the theatre of the campaign, is very probable. When Odumata, the Ashantee general, conquered Banna, and reduced it to the condition of a tributary State, his army, for the same reason, was composed almost exclusively of Buntukus. Abu Bekr must, therefore, have been mistaken, in supposing that Dinkara was a principal in the war. And it is not surprising that circumstances should have combined to impress the mind of a boy, that the affair between Dinkara and the governor Kujoh was the cause of the war; when, in fact, its origin ought to be traced to the overthrow of the king of Banna by his enemies, whose ultimate object was to subvert the throne of his superior, the new king of Ashantee. The conclusion, that Abu Bekr was one of the prisoners whom Osai Tutu Quamina carried back with him through Buntuku to Coomassie, (Kumasi,) is strengthened by the further agreement of the two narratives with respect to time. The Rev. Mr. Renouard calculates, that Abu Bekr left"], [58, "30 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Africa about the year 1807 or 1808; but Dr. Madden, whose humane exertions procured Abu Bekr his bberty, supposes, that he embarked for Jamaica about 1804; which latter period agrees within two or three years with Dupuis's date of the first campaign of Osai Tutu Quamina. The war in which Abu Bekr lost his freedom cannot be fixed at a later period than that which Dupuis specifies : for it was in 1807 that Osai Tutu Quamina invaded Fantee; and, previous to that invasion, the Ashantee empire had enjoyed pro found peace during a period of five years. But when it is considered that some considerable time must necessarily have elapsed between the cap ture of Abu Bekr, and his embarkation for the West Indies, the discrepancy between Dr. Madden and Dupuis almost entirely disappears. As Abu Bekr may probably be cited as a witness in a subsequent part of this work, it will be interesting to glance at the proof of his veracity, deducible from the brief account which he gives of his journey from Coomassie to the sea side. He states, that he went through Askuma and Ajimmakuh, in the Fantee (Fanti) country, to Daghdh, where he embarked ; and the fact is, that all these three places were noted depots for slaves before the legal abobtion of the slave-trade by Great Britain. The slaves from the interior were brought down to the great slave-mart at"], [59, "CHAPTER I. 31 Mansu, and were marched from thence, in different directions, for the sea; and those who were to be embarked at Daghdh (the native name of the place, called Lago by Europeans) went from Mansu by Askuma (Asikuma) and Ajimmakuh. Wilham De Graft has visited the three places ; and has often heard his father, and other elderly persons, speak of them as having been formerly depots for slaves. Now, on no other principle can it be accounted for, that an old Negro, who had been upwards of thirty years a slave in the West Indies, should describe those places so correctly, but that their names were indehbly imprinted upon his memory, as he was dragged through them from the land of his fathers to a distant captivity. That was a period in his life which could never be forgotten ; and its attendant circumstances would naturally form the subject of his constant meditation, and become inter woven with all his liveliest recollections.* The martial prowess of Osai Tutu Quamina was next displayed in that war with Gaman which has been termed the first Buntuku war of his reign. This was occasioned by the revolt of part of the Gaman people from the govern ment of the vice-king, \u2014 the representative of the Ashantee sovereign, \u2014 who aimed at regaining * See Note A."], [60, "32 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. their national independence, under the nephew of their late monarch. This young prince had enjoyed the protection of the sultan of Ghofan, who, as has been stated, lost both his army and his life, in the attempt to overthrow the government of the new monarch of Ashantee. The rising of these brave people (for so the con queror himself characterized them to Dupuis) was speedily suppressed; and a profound peace of five years' continuance followed. During this period of tranquillity, Ashantee (As-hanti) enjoyed a higher reputation than she had ever perhaps attained at any former period ; and alliance with her illustrious sovereign was gene rally courted.

That part of the coast of Guinea which is dis tinguished by the appellation of the Gold Coast commences with Apobonia, where the Ivory Coast ends, and reaches to the River Volta, where the Slave Coast begins. It first became known to Europeans in the sixteenth century. At that period the spirit of discovery which, during the c 5"], [62, "ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. 34 middle ages, had been confined to the Arabs, manifested itself in Europe in a most remarkable manner. The Portuguese, who led the way, pro secuted their researches with enthusiastic ardour along the western coast of Africa; and from various points penetrated into the interior, in the hope of finding the far-famed Prester John,* whose empire, first supposed to be in Asia, and after wards transferred in imagination to Africa, excited the most intense curiosity, and became the ulti mate object and aim of the enterprises of the Portuguese. The great end to which all their researches in Africa were rendered subordi nate was the discovery of this mysterious kingdom. The Engbsh first commenced trading with Gui nea in the latter end of the reign of Edward VI. ; but the merchants who engaged in such commerce were exposed to considerable risk, in consequence of tbe pretensions of the Portuguese, who, having built the fort of St. George del Mina, endeavoured to enforce their claim of an exclusive right to * The origin of the name is doubtful ; but Rubruquis and others early travellers having reported that there was a Christian sovereign of that name in Asia, an ineffec tual search was made for his kingdom ; when another rumour arose, that a Cliristian monarch did actually reign somewhere on the eastern coast of Africa, from whence his dominions stretched far into the interior, and the research *,*, as in consequence renewed in that quarter of tho globe."], [63, "35 CHAPTER II. trade with the Gold Coast as well as the other parts of Western Africa. In the reign of James I. the trade began to be encouraged by the Government; and under Charles IL, in the year 1662, a chartered Com pany was formed, entitled, \"The Company of Royal Adventurers of England, trading to Africa.\" This step was taken with a view to the protection of the trade from the aggressions of the Dutch, who, having deprived the Portuguese of all their forts and settlements on the Gold Coast, at tempted in their turn to monopolize the entire commerce of Western Africa ; although the Engbsh had long had a fort at Cormantine, and had also estabbshed factories at other places on the Gold Coast, and thus enjoyed as good a right to par ticipate in the trade as themselves. A war between the English and Dutch followed ; at the end of which, in 1667, the Engbsh Company were left in possession of only one fort, that of Cabo Corso, or, as it is now called, Cape-Coast Castle, which had been taken from the Dutch. As the war had exhausted the resources of the Company, they surrendered theh' charter to the crown, and a new Company was incorporated, in the year 1672, under the name of \" The Royal African Company of England,\" with ample powers and pri vileges for the purpose of prosecuting and protect ing the trade between Africa and England. The"], [64, "ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. 36 following enumeration has been given of the estab lishments on the Gold Coast, at the time of the incorporation of this second Company. The Dutch were in possession of the strong fortress of St. George del Mina, (Elmina,) and of the fort at Cormantine, called Fort Amsterdam, which they had taken from the Engbsh during the war. And they had likewise another, named Fort Anthon}', at Axim ; a fourth, called Fort Sebastian, on the river Chamah ; a fifth, called Fort Nassau, at Mouree ; a sixth, called Crevecceur, at Accra (Akrah) ; and a seventh, named Fort Conraadsburg, at St. Jago, within gun-shot of Elmina. The Danes were in possession of one small but impregnable fort, (afterwards called Fort Royal,) on the top of a hill, within gun-shot of Cape-Coast Castle, and of another at Accra, to the eastward of the Dutch fort at the same place. And the elector of Bran- denburgh had one good fort at Cape Three Points. The second Engbsh Company, finding them selves in possession of only one fort, proceeded to strengthen their position ; and, for this purpose, they enlarged Cape-Coast Castle, and built one fort at Accra, another at Dixcove, a third at Winnebah, a fourth at Succondee, and a fifth at Commenda, and rebuilt a sixth at Annamaboe. Three of these forts were only about musket-shot distance from Dutch forts. The Company bke-"], [65, "37 CHAPTER II. wise purchased Fredericksberg, or Fort Royal, from the Danes. By these exertions the Engbsh interest was put on an equal footing with that of the Dutch, to the great mortification of the Dutch Company, who had endeavoured, by force of arms and other means, to prevent the erection of the new forts. In the year 1752 this second Company was divested of its charter by Act of Parbament ; and their forts, castles, and all their other possessions, were transferred to a third new Company which was then formed. >- \u25a0*-. The Gold Coast, which from the time of its discovery had been the cause of so much conten tion among the maritime powers of Europe, was divided into several independent States. Of these Fantee (Fanti) was the most considerable. The capi tal of the British settlements, Cape-Coast Castle, is situated in the Fetu country, formerly governed by a dey; but that State fell under the influ ence of Fantee, to the laws, regulations, and customs of which the people were obbged to sub mit. The unfortunate governor, Meredith, who himself at length became a victim to the violent conduct of the natives, in a letter to the Directors of the African Institution, written about the period when the Ashantees were beginning to make their power felt upon the Gold Coast, thus expresses himself as to the turbulent"], [66, "38 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. character, as well as influence, of the Fantee people : \u2014 \" The Asiantees are threatening to pay us another visit; and it is the current opinion, that the Fantees must be either subdued by the Asiantees, or means devised to restrain their ungovernable conduct, before the country is tran quillized, or before much improvement is effected. The Fantees are now to be considered a large body : they have brought under their subjection, either by threats or favourable promises, a number of small estates ; so that from Cape Coast to the extremity of the Agoona country may be put down as governed by the Fantees. To say that such and such places bear distinct names, is now merely to signify that they were formerly inha bited by a distinct people.\" The irruption of the Ashantees into the Fantee country first brought them into collision with the British, in the year 1807. This invasion originated in a dispute between two of the principal chiefs of Asin, a dependency of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) immediately contiguous to Fantee (Fanti) on the north. The grave of a distin guished caboceer, a subject of Amu, who ruled over the eastern half of Asin, was plundered of a quantity of gold by a near relation of Apoutai, joint ruler with Chibbu of the other half of that country ; and the offender having made his escape, Amu applied"], [67, "39 CHAPTER II. to Chibbu for redress. This was refused; and he then appealed to the court of Coomassie (Kumasi). The king delayed for a considerable time to give judgment, in the hope of effecting a reconcibation between the parties ; but being disappointed in this expectation, he at last decreed that the offender, Apoutai, should make compensation to the rela tives of the deceased, to the amount of the property which had been stolen. Apoutai refused to submit to the decree, and a war foUowed between him and Amu, in which the latter at length prevailed, and ravaged the territories of his opponent. The king now interfered, and endeavoured to reconcile the contending chiefs, by sending to each of them a present of gold; and Amu had the prudence to submit to the authority of the king, by taking up a merely defensive position in the bills of Moisi. A second embassy was then sent from Coomassie, with other presents, to both chiefs; and Amu was required to break up his camp, and leave the palaver as it stood until the next Adai custom, while Chibbu was commanded to keep the peace, and not molest Amu on his homeward march. Apoutai appeared to acquiesce, and drew off his troops ; but afterwards came upon Amu by sur prise, when he had quitted his defensive position, and completely routed him : and, in further contempt of the king's authority, he barbarously murdered the royal messengers, and a number of"], [68, "40 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. other Ashantees who were in the camp, and tauntingly suspended their mutilated bodies upon trees on the border of the province. Forbearance on the part of the king was now at an end. He immediately placed himself at the head of a powerful army, and advanced into the Asin territory. Chibbu and Apoutai having in vain attempted to impede his progress, retreated towards the Prah; but, before they could cross that river, were entirely defeated, and, according to the popular Ashantee songs, thirty thousand of their troops perished in the field. The two Asin leaders, however, effected their escape, and were cordially welcomed by the Fantees, who pledged themselves to protect them to the uttermost of their power. Apparently anxious to obtain pos- session of his enemies by friendly negotiation, the king despatched an embassy to Akum, the cabo- ceer of Asikuma, which, although a Fantee pro- vince, was in some sense dependent upon Ashantee, (As-hanti,) requiring the surrender of Chibbu and Apoutai. The hberal present which the king sent was accepted ; but the Council of Abrah, the capital of Fantee, (Fanti,) refused either to dehver up the fugitive chiefs, or to appoint deputies to go to the royal camp to assist in settbng the differences by a legal investigation. The king then sent to de mand that he might march through Fantee in pursuit of the remnant of the Asin army ; but"], [69, "CHAPTER II. 41 this application was also rejected, and his messen gers were put to death, and their bodies treated with savage indignity. The king, having waited in vain for the return of his messengers, and probably suspecting their fate, ordered his army to advance under the con- duct of two of his generals, who defeated the united forces of Asin and Fantee (Fanti) upon the frontiers; but Chibbu and Apoutai again saved themselves by flight. Another battle afterwards took place, between the retreating army which had rallied and the van of the Ashantee army, when, the king coming up with the remainder of his forces, the Ashantees gained a complete vic- tory ; and part of the survivors fled to Abrah, and others, among whom was Chibbu, towards the sea-side. Apoutai then made offers of peace, which the king accepted, acceding to aU his pro- posals ; and, as an evidence of a perfect reconciba- tion, he sent large presents to both Chibbu and Apoutai. The proposals of peace had, however, been made in duplicity, either to gain time, or accomplish some other object; which end having been obtained, the mask was thrown off, and the messengers whom the king had despatched with the presents were, bke the former, inhumanly butchered. Their hearts were reported to have been devoured by the Braffoes while yet palpitat ing; and the carcasses of the unfortunate victims"], [70, "42 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. were suspended upon the boughs of the trees, while their heads, after experiencing disgusting treatment, were placed in a row along the path on which the king would have to advance. The Asins and Fantees then retreated towards the south, persuading themselves that the king would not dare to prosecute the campaign among the large towns, and especially those placed under the guns of the British and Dutch forts; but the sequel showed how miserably they were deceived in their calculations. The king was now excited to the highest pitch of indignant feeling, and he took the \" great oath \" that he would never sheath his sword, or return to his capital, until he had obtained the heads of Chibbu and Apoutai. From this moment the war assumed the most determined character ; and nothing less than the utter extermination of the Fantees appeared likely to satisfy the infuriated monarch. Orders were given to spare neither age nor sex; and, for a time, those orders were executed to the letter. Desolation and ruin followed in the track of the Ashantee army, and the silence and sohtude of death reigned over the country through which they had passed. The king, after a sanguinary battle, having taken and destroyed Abrah, the capital, appeared to be somewhat appeased ; aud sent to several other Fantee towns, promising that, on their submission, the lives and property"], [71, "43 CHAPTER II. of the people should be protected. Among the rest, he despatched two of his sword-bearers to Emperou, with pacific proposals ; but Quasi Beni, a caboceer of Abrah, having escaped with a few troops from the destruction of the capital, per- suaded the inhabitants, who had already engaged another body of auxiliaries, to unite with him in resisting the Ashantees ; and the royal messen- gers were treated with indignity, and then mas- sacred. This outrageous proceeding again roused the king to action; and a division of the army was immediately sent against Emperou. The enemy greatly outnumbered the Ashantees, who, in the onset, were repulsed, and driven back upon the main army ; but a charge made, by the king in person, upon the flank and rear of the Fantee army, decided the contest. It is stated that, with the exception of about one hundred persons, who fled before the town was assaulted by the victo- rious Ashantees, not one of its inhabitants, of either sex, nor a single individual of the army which had bravely attempted its defence, was lest alive. Several of the caboceers of the place, after killing their own wives and children, destroyed themselves; and all the rest fell beneath the sword of the conqueror, or perished in the flames which reduced the town to a mass of ruins. When Dupuis passed this place, twelve years afterwards, portions of the waUs, which exhibited the action"], [72, "44 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. of fire, were still standing, and the surface of the earth, in various places, was whitened with ashes and bleached human bones and skulls. The king now directed his course towards Anna maboe, (Anamabu,) then the largest town upon the coast, whither Chibbu and Apoutai had fled, after the destruction of Abrah. But as it is the pohcy of the Ashantees, on invading a country, to leave no enemies in the rear while they press forward to the seat of the government, or other principal town of the enemy, he left one half of his army to destroy the remainder of the Fantee towns, and to exterminate the entire population. The king himself acknowledged to Dupuis that, at that period, none were taken prisoners, except a few principal caboceers, who were reserved for punishment at the rejoicings to be celebrated in the capital on his return. Among the towns which were then destroyed was Mankasim; which, from the extent of the ruins still visible, Mr. Freeman is of opbiion must, at least, have been half the size of Coomassie (Kumasi) itself. The advanced guard of the Ashantee (As-hanti) army, under the command of the viceroy of Den kera, first reached the sea-coast at Cormantine, three miles eastward of Annamaboe. This town they destroyed, and took possession of the Dutch fort, known by the name of Fort Amsterdam. The near approach of the Ashantees now began to"], [73, "45 CHAPTER II. excite uneasy apprehensions at Annamaboe ; and Mr. White, the governor of the castle, sent a messenger with a flag of truce, to inquire respect ing the king's intentions. An unsatisfactory answer was returned ; at which Mr. White ex pressed his regret, offering to use his influence to obtain from the Annamaboes redress for any just grievances which the king might be able to substantiate ; but stating, that unless the king could produce sufficient cause of complaint, he should afford the inhabitants protection against any hostile attack on his part. A week elapsed before anything further occurred, when a reconnoitering party of Ashan tees were discovered in possession of a point of land about a mile distant from Annamaboe (Anamabu). Almost all the inhabitants capable of bearing arms sallied forth to attack them, and succeeded in driving them from this posi tion; but while they were engaged with this small party, the king was employed in securing aU the passes leading to the town; and on the following morning advanced to attack it. The armed inhabitants were again drawn forth to meet him, but were soon put to flight, and driven towards the town in great confusion. The alarm now became general, and the aged men, women, and children crowded into the area of the castle for protection ; while one or two great guns were"], [74, "46 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. fired, with a view to deter the Ashantees from advancing. The supposition that this would inspire the Ashantees with fear, argued a great ignorance of their character. Undismayed, they pursued the flying inhabitants through the town, down to the beach, mercilessly destroying all who came in their way ; and then, in despite of the guns of the fort, the discharges from which made great havoc in their ranks, they advanced under its very walls, and carried off the women for whom room could not be found within. The fort itself was soon reduced to the utmost extremity ; for the Ashantees, advancing almost to the very muzzles of the cannon, shortly rendered them useless, by the severity of their well-directed fire ; and, at the same time, assailed the gate with such vigour, that had not night come to their aid, the little garrison would not have been able to repel the assailants. After a lapse of two or three days, the king prepared to renew his attack upon the fort. Six thousand choice men were selected, half of whom were to attempt to blow up or scale the walls, under cover of the continual fire of the other half ; but the very morning of the day on which the king had vowed, by the help of his gods, to seat himself in the governor's chair, a flag of truce was lowered from the waUs. A negotiation en sued, and the kmg deebning to go to Cape-Coast"], [75, "47 CHAPTER II. Castle, the governor-in-chief, Colonel Torrane, went to the royal camp, and concluded a treaty of peace. Chibbu and Apoutai, the originators of the war, had quitted Annamaboe (Anamabu) previous to the approach of the Ashantees, and taken refuge at Cape-Coast town; from which place, Apoutai again made his escape, but Chibbu was deb vered up to the king, and, after suffering the most exquisite tortures in the rejoicing which took place at Coomassie on the return of the army, his head became one of the principal decorations of the death-drum of the king. Of the inhabitants of Annamaboe, at least eight thousand perished in the contest ; and many of the survivors were carried off by the king as prisoners, either to suffer death in other forms, or to be consigned to slavery. The elder De Graft, the bnguist, was one of the brave defenders of the fort on that memorable occasion, and received a musket-shot, which he carries in his arm to the present day. A second invasion of Fantee (Fanti) by the Ash antees took place in the year 1811. This was occa sioned by the Fantees having determined to wreak their vengeance on the people of Elmina and Accra, (Akrah,) because they had not taken part against the Ashantees in 1807. The king having been informed, by the Dutch governor of Elmina, of the warlike proceedings of the Fantees, sent four thousand troops to protect Elmina, and another"], [76, "ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. army of twenty-five thousand more to defend Accra (in the trade of which he was interested) against that body of the Fantees who had pro ceeded to attack it. The force which was sent to aid Elmina defeated the Fantees in several en gagements ; but the army intended for Accra became involved in war with the chiefs of Aqua pim and Akim, who had thrown off their allegi ance to Ashantee : and the Fantees in that quarter thus escaped the chastisement which the king had designed to inflict. Another invasion, in the year 1817, reduced the Fantees to the greatest distress. Incalculable misery resulted from the devastation committed by the Ashantees. They swept the country before them, destroying the whole of the plantations; and famine and wretchedness attended all their movements. Wilham De Graft has a vivid recollection of that awful period. He was then only a boy, and well recollects that, on one occasion when it was expected that the Ash antees woidd force their way into Cape-Coast town, a friend of his family caught him under his arm, and ran with him into the castle for protection. The British, having interfered to protect the natives, rendered themselves obnox ious to the invaders, who sat down before Cape-Coast Castle, and continued to blockade it with such determined perseverance, that the"], [77, "49 CHAPTER II. government found it necessary, in order to avert the imminent danger with which the place was threatened, to advance a large sum of money, which the king demanded from the Fantees. With this the invader was willing to content him self, and he again returned to his own capital. These repeated irruptions produced such a feel ing of alarm and insecurity, that the local govern ment was led to prefer an earnest request to the Committee of the African Society at home, to authorize and provide for an embassy to be sent to the court of Ashantee ; with a view to conciliate its powerful monarch, and negotiate an extension of commerce. This request was acceded to ; and on the 22d of April, 1817, Mr. James, governor of the fort at British Accra, Mr. Bowdich, nephew of Mr. Smith, the go vernor-in- chief at Cape-Coast Castle, Mr. Hutchinson, and surgeon Tedlie, set out on a Mission to Coomassie. How great was the importance which the local government at tached to the establishment of friendly relations with Ashantee, (As-hanti,) will appear from an extract of a Despatch from Cape-Coast Castle, which was laid before a Parbamentary Committee in 1817. It is dated March 5th of that year, a few weeks only before the embassy was undertaken. \"From circumstances which have lately trans pired, we have reason to think that General Daendels is intriguing with the king of Ashantee, D"], [78, "ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. 50 and using every means to bring the Engbsh into disrepute; but he carries on his designs so secretly, that we cannot produce any proofs. We shall, however, use every exertion to counteract his plans ; and have full rebance in being able to succeed. To our assistance, in accomphshing this desirable object, the presents for the king of Ashantee, by the store-ship- have arrived most opportunely; and they are such as we consider will be highly gratifying to him. An Ashantee messenger, deputed by the king to the Fantees, is now at Abrah : to him we have sent an invita tion to visit Cape Coast ; and he promises to be down in the course of ten days. On his return, we purpose selecting an intelligent native to accompany him ; to whom we shall give the requi site instructions to the king, regarding the embassy which we are desirous of despatching previous to the setting in of the rains. We shall observe your instructions relative to the arrange ment of the Mission ; and we are very sanguine in our expectations, that the consequences attending the result of it will prove highly beneficial, not only in the extension of British commerce and influence with the nations of the interior, but from such information being collected as may considerably contribute to science, and be an accession to the stock of geographical knowledge. The commercial intercourse with the Ashantees"], [79, "51 CHAPTER II. has been for the last ten months extremely flou rishing, and is now evidently daily improving. The necessity of a close albance with the king of Ashantee becomes, therefore, more obvious than ever ; and it is only by cultivating and promoting this connexion that an inland trade can be thoroughly opened, and through his means inquiries may be directed to the interior, which may gradually open an extensive intercourse with the natives.\" The British embassy were favourably received by Osai Tutu Quamina ; but no sooner had they proceeded to business, than a misunderstanding arose respecting the Fantee \" Notes.\" When the African Company established itself upon the Gold Coast, it did not obtain any territory either by conquest or purchase ; but merely hired sufficient land for the erection of forts, and gave pro missory notes to the native chiefs for the regular payment of the stipulated rent. The other European Companies, also, were placed under similar obhgations for the land on which their forts were built. On the subjugation of the countries upon the coast, by the king of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) these notes feU into his hands ; and at the time of the embassy's visit, he had received the rents for the Dutch fort at Elmina, and the Engbsh, Dutch, and Danish forts at Accra (Akrah). On the same ground, the right of conquest, he d 2"], [80, "52 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. claimed the Fantee notes ; and Dupuis expressly states, that the treaty of peace which Colonel Torrane negotiated with the king at Annamaboe, in the year 1807, was a formal and solemn acknow ledgment that the whole of Fantee (Fanti) belonged to the king, to whom he paid the arrears of rent then due for the ground on which the Annamaboe (Anamabu) Fort and Cape-Coast Castle stood. The king did not, however, as it would appear, obtain at that time actual possession of the notes for these two places ; for, at a later period, Amoney, king of Annamaboe, and Adoko, chief of the Braffoes, prevailed upon Governor Smith to write other notes, engaging to pay the king of Ashantee four ackies of gold per month for the two forts ; reserving for themselves the remainder of the rent specified in the original notes, which they retained in their own hands. These were the notes concerning which the king demanded an explanation from the embassy; and the answer which Mr. James gave appears to have confirmed the suspicions of the king, that the governor-in- chief had combined with the Fantees to defraud him of his due. The conduct of the king and his captains, in consequence, became so violent, that Mr. Bowdich, in a state of alarm, interposed, ancl assured the king that the governor would do right ; and proposed that messengers should be"], [81, "CHAPTER II. 53 sent down to Cape-Coast Castle, to receive his explanation of the whole affair. The result of this appeal to the governor was, that Mr. James was recalled, Mr. Bowdich was placed in his stead at the head of the embassy, and the demands of the king respecting the notes were acceded to. The governor explained the circumstances in which he had been deceived into a compliance with the wishes of the Fantee chiefs, Amoney and Adoko, by writing the notes of which the king complained; and sent the king two other notes for four ounces of gold per month, (copies of which are given by Dupuis,) in which the governor stated, that, in consequence of the con quest of the Fantee country by the king of Ashantee, the notes for Annamaboe Fort and Cape-Coast Castle were, by consent of the former owners, transferred to the conqueror ; and, at the same time assured the king, in his accompanying letter, that the amount of these notes should thenceforth be regularly paid to his receiver, on behalf of the Company, at Cape-Coast Castle. The affair of the Fantee notes having thus been settled to the satisfaction of the king, the negotia tion proceeded, and a friendly treaty was finally concluded. By virtue of this treaty, Mr. Hutchinson was left as British resident at the court of Ashantee ; and Mr. Bowdich returned to Cape-Coast Castle."], [82, "CHAPTER III.

Mr. Dupuis, whose long residence in Barbary had contri buted to qualify him for such an office, was accordingly appointed consul; and, after being detained in England about nine months from the date of his commission, he set sail for the coast of Africa in the month of November, 1818. On his arrival, Mr. Dupuis found that the king of Ashantee was engaged in hostilities with his vassal Dinkara, king of Gaman, who had thrown off his allegiance ; and that Mr. Hutchinson had left Coomassie on the eve of this, the second Buntuku, war, and was then at Cape-Coast Castle. He learned, moreover, that a considerable trade with Ashantee had resulted from Mr. Bowdich's successful negotiations ; but that it was a matter of general complaint without the waUs of the castle, that the trade had been to a great extent monopolized by a few leading servants of the Company. He also discovered that his own appointment as consul at the Ashantee capital was viewed with much jealousy; and he persuaded"], [84, "56 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. himself that the local government was willing to risk a rupture with the king, for the purpose of defeating the objects for which that appoint ment was made by the British government. Be this as it may, a misunderstanding soon took place. Reports of doubtful origin arose, to the effect, that the king had been defeated by the Buntukus ; and these reports were joyfully received by the Cape-Coast people, who expressed their hopes that the power of Ashantee would be overthrown, and proceeded to treat with dis respect the Ashantee captain who was placed as resident among them. He reported those pro ceedings to his master; and the visits of the Ashantee traders were, in consequence, to a great extent discontinued. While things were in this critical state, two of the king's messengers visited Cape-Coast Castle, in order to complain of the conduct of the people of Commenda. They had been sent thither by their sovereign to convey some jaw-bones, as trophies of his victory over the Buntukus ; but, instead of meeting with a courteous reception, they had been treated with violence, and contemptuously turned out of the town. The messengers then repaired to Cape-Coast Castle, and claimed the protection of the British by virtue of the treaty; but the government refused to interfere in the affair, and the messengers were obbged to depart without"], [85, "57 CHAPTER III. obtaining redress. Shortly after this, another untoward event took place in the death of the Ashantee resident at Cape-Coast town; the sud denness of which excited a suspicion that he was cut off by poison secretly administered. And further provocation was given to the king, by the rejoicings of the Cape-Coast people, at the report of his defeat and death; which report, although encouraged at the castle, was treated as a mere idle rumour at all the neighbouring settlements. The arrival of a messenger, bearing a gold liilted sword, put an end to the delusion. He stated, that he had been despatched from the camp to complain of the treatment which his two messengers had received at Commenda; to claim the interference of the governor on the ground of the treaty ; and to say, that, if the governor stiU refused his friendly interposition, he should send down some troops to Commenda, and avenge his insulted dignity in another way. The messenger was moreover instructed to express the anger and regret which the conduct of the Cape-Coast people had produced in the mind of the king ; and to request the governor to exert his influ ence to prevent a recurrence of those matters of complaint. To this message the governor returned an answer which was regarded by the king as uncour teous and unfriendly ; and the elders and chiefs of d 5"], [86, "58 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. the town were encouraged to arm the people, and build a mud wall for their protection against the Ashantees. The king, however, would not bebeve that the governor had really sent the reply which was debvered to him. Having subjected his mes senger to the torture, he threw him into prison, intending to put him to a cruel death, if he discovered that he had made a false report ; and he then despatched another messenger to Cape- Coast Castle, to ascertain the exact truth of the whole affair. In the mean time, the news that the Cape-Coast people were fortifying their town, reached the royal camp in Gaman ; on which the captains instantly unsheathed their sabres, and requested permission to go down and punish them without delay. To this the king objected, on the ground that he held a \" book,\" or treaty, with the white men ; but engaged that he would apply for redress, for he was persuaded that an imposition had been practised upon the governor. In fulfilment of this promise, a third messenger, of high rank, accompanied by a large retinue, was sent down; who, at a pubbe audience in Cape- Coast Castle, recapitulated all the grievances of which lus master had cause to complain; and, producing the treaty from a box, presented it to the governor, desiring him to read it, and say whether its provisions did not authorize the king to demand satisfaction ; and telling him, in con-"], [87, "CHAPTER III. 59 elusion, that should he stiff refuse to fulfil the obbgations of the treaty, he might retain it ; for the king could not reconcile it to his views of honour and good faith to go to war so long as he kept the treaty in his own hands. The formal reading of the treaty was commenced, and was pro ceeded with to the fourth article ; * when the Ash antee messenger again arose, and, in the name of his sovereign, demanded satisfaction upon the faith of that article ; declaring that if it were not com pbed with, the natives of the town would suffer the vengeance of Ashantee ; for, although with respect to the castle, the king did not wish to make war with white men, his own people must obey him, or pay the forfeit of their disobedience. This demand was enforced by the loud clamours of the messenger's attendants; when some of the town chiefs, fuUy awakened to a sense of the impending danger, endeavoured to clear themselves from blame, by throwing the responsibility upon the government, alleging, that they had only acted at the instigation of the whites. When order was restored, the messenger desired that the remain- * \" In order to avert the -horrors of war, it is agreed, that, in any case of aggression on the part of the natives under British protection, the king shall complain thereof to the governor-in-chief, to obtain redress ; and that he will in no case resort to hostility, without endeavouring, as much as possible, to effect an amicable arrangement\""], [88, "60 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. ing clauses of the treaty might be read ; and, at the seventh article,* he again arose, and required satisfaction upon the faith of that artiele also. From the demands which the messenger made in this interview, no explanations or arguments could induce him to recede. He declared that his orders were peremptory; and that, unless the local authorities promised to do the king justice, he had no alternative but to leave the treaty at the castle. At this juncture, Mr. Dupuis requested the governor to make known to the messenger his consular appointment to Coomassie ; on the announcement of which, the messenger bowed to Mr. Dupuis, and took him by the hand in token of respect and good-will. This circum stance gave another turn to the whole affair. The messenger appeared for a time at a loss to decide whether he should give up the treaty, or take it back, and leave it to Mr. Dupuis to talk the palaver with the king ; but at length he resolved to keep possession of the treaty, and remain at Cape Coast until he could obtain fresh instructions from Coomassie, as to the course he ought to pursue. After a considerable lapse of time, the alarming * \" The governors of the respective forts shall, at all times, afford every protection in their power to the persons and property of the people of Ashantee, who may resort to the water-side.\""], [89, "CHAPTER III. 61 news was brought, that a large body of Ashantee troops was at hand ; which proved, however, to be another embassy. The king had sent one of his own nephews, with a train of twelve hundred attendants, who entered the town with a display of splendour which had not been witnessed on the coast from the time that the lring himself was there. This new ambassador formally reiterated all the grievances of which his relative had to complain; denounced the Cape-Coast people as rebels ; signified the royal displeasure at the conduct of the local authorities; and concluded by demanding sixteen hundred ounces of gold as a fine from the natives, and sixteen hundred additional from the castle. A fruitless negotiation ensued, when the ambas sador again demanded an audience in the hall ; in which he repeated the claims of the king upon the castle and the town; declaring that it was the fixed determination of the king, not to allow the aggression of the natives to pass unpunished ; and that, although he wished to live in friendship with the whites, unless the most ample satisfaction were promptly made, it would be sought by an appeal to arms. Concibatory measures were now seen to be indispensably necessary; and the governor in council at length resolved to facilitate the departure of Mr. Dupuis to Coomassie ; and, in consideration of the critical state of affairs,"], [90, "62 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. greatly to increase the number and value of the presents which Mr. Dupuis had brought with him from England, for the king of Ashantee. Thus, after having been detained upon the coast, by various causes, upwards of twelve months from the time of his landing, Mr. Dupuis set off for Coomassie, in the beginning of the month of February, 1820. At his leaving, however, another circumstance occurred, which not only furnished additional proof of the absence of cordial co operation between himself and the Cape- Coast government, but was in itself sufficient to warrant the apprehension, that his mission would not be productive of the results which its projectors so ardently desired. On opening the papers which were given to him, on the eve of his departure, he found that the governor and council had prepared copious instructions for his guidance ; and he was informed, that unless he accepted those instruc tions as his rule of conduct, the governor would withhold the presents, and send another person to convey them to the king. With such conditions, however, Mr. Dupuis judged that he could not comply, without proving faithless to the trust re posed in him by His Majesty's government, from whom he had directly received his commission; and he therefore left the instructions with a friend to be returned to the Castle, accompanied by a written protest, when he should have got"], [91, "63 CHAPTER III. so far on his journey as to be beyond the governor's reach. On his arrival at Coomassie, (Kumasi,) Mr. Dupuis was favourably received by the king, who appeared disposed to settle the existing differences without having recourse to arms. A lengthened negotiation accordingly ensued ; during which, the feelings of the king were frequently excited to fury, when adverting to the conduct of the Cape-Coast people, and the treatment which he alleged to have received from the local government. At length, when convinced, by a reference to Mr. Bowdich's treaty, that its provisions did not authorize lum to demand a fine from the governor, he gave up that claim; but no argu ment or persuasion could induce him to relinquish his demands upon the town. A second treaty was finally concluded, in which the king bound himself to receive and acknowledge Mr. Dupuis, as his Britannic Majesty's consul at Coomassie ; promised fidebty to the crown of Great Britain ; acknowledged that all differences between him self and the Engbsh were adjusted; and bound himself to support and encourage commerce between Ashantee (As-hanti) and Cape Coast and its dependencies, by all the means in his power. On the part of the British government, Mr. Dupuis again acknowledged the sovereignty asserted by the king of Ashantee over the Fantee"], [92, "64 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. territory, on the express condition, that the king agreed to allow the natives, residing under British protection, to enjoy the benefit of British laws ; and to be amenable to them only in case of any act of aggression on their part. To this treaty, supplementary articles were annexed ; by one of which the king, to eradicate, as he said, from his dominions, the seeds of disobedience and insubordination, excluded the natives of Cape-Coast town from participating in the benefits of the treaty ; but, at the same time, bound himself that, whatever plans he might see fit to adopt to bring them under subjection, he would not destroy the town, nor allow a gun to be fired into it, or suffer his troops to commit any act of hostility or depredation therein on the inhabitants or on their property. In another of those articles, the king further pledged himself to afford protec tion, in person and property, to Missionaries or others, being subjects of His Britannic Majesty, who might wish to estabhsh themselves in any part of his territory, for the purpose of propagating the Christian religion ; and at the same time formally and cordially invited to his country such well disposed men. This treaty, with the supple mentary articles, was executed on the 23d day of March, 1820. Mr. Dupuis then returned to Cape-Coast Castle, accompanied by some, Ashantees of rank, whom"], [93, "65 CHAPTER III. the king sent as ambassadors to the British court, to maintain a good understanding between the two countries, and dehver numerous presents to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent. The reception which Mr. Dupuis met with on his return was not flattering. Sir George Collier, the commander of the British squadron upon the coast, had been applied to by the local authorities to support them in their opposition to the Ashan tees ; and, encouraged by his promise of assistance, they refused to accede to the treaty which Mr. Dupuis had negotiated, on the plea that it trans ferred the sovereignty of the Fantee country to the king of Ashantee. The palaver respecting the fine which the king had imposed upon the Cape-Coast people was reserved, when the treaty was executed, for final adjustment on the spot; but the local authorities withdrew the proposal which they had previously made, to give the king one hundred and fifty ounces of gold, as a peace offering on behalf of the town; and further decided that the payment of the tribute or rent, which the king had been accustomed to receive, should be discontinued. Mr. Dupuis made a formal protest against the proceedings of the local authorities, and appbed to Sir George Collier, when he returned from his cruise, to interpose so far as to support his protest against the adoption of any rash and hostile pro-"], [94, "66 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. eeedings, until the sentiments of His Majesty's ministers, in relation to the treaty, should be known. Sir George, however, declined all inter ference, and also offered reasons for refusing to convey the Ashantee ambassadors to England ; on which Mr. Dupuis made the ambassadors acquainted with the actual state of affairs ; and, having sent a message to the king of Ashantee, entreating him to remember his oath, and main tain peace, he proceeded to England with Sir George Collier, for the purpose of laying the whole case before the government at home. At this period an important change took place in the administration of affairs on the Gold Coast. The British connexion with that part of Africa had for some time occupied the serious attention of ministers, and the whole subject had been fully investigated by Committees of the House of Commons, in the years 1816 and 1817. As the result of those inquiries, a Bill was brought into Parhament, in 1821, for abolishing the African Company, and transferring to the Crown all the Company's forts and possessions. This Bill passed into law, and the forts on the Gold Coast were placed under the authority of Sir Charles M'Carthy, who had for some years ably conducted the government of Sierra-Leone. When Sir Charles arrived at Cape-Coast Castle, in the month of March, 1822, things were found"], [95, "67 CHAPTER III. in an unsatisfactory state. Prince Adum, the Ashantee ambassador to the local government, after waiting patiently for communications from England, two months longer than the time spe cified by Mr. Dupuis, had withdrawn with his retinue to a short distance from Cape-Coast town, and placed it in a state of blockade ; and the whole of the trade with Ashantee had been trans ferred from that place to the Dutch settlements. Whether the policy which the new governor was led to adopt was, in all respects, the best, may, perhaps, be doubted. Let it be admitted, for the sake of argument, that Mr. Dupuis be- trayed great want of moderation and temper in \u25a0his disputes with the local authorities, and that his evident partiabty for the Ashantees, in many cases, blinded his judgment; still there are cer- tain well-established conclusions, the consideration of which serves to show that a warlike pobcy on the part of the British was not that which best har- monized with a due regard to the honour of theil- country. That the king of Ashantee (As-hanti) had established the right of a conqueror over the countries on the Gold Coast, and that the British had acknowledged that right from the days of Governor Torrane to the time of Governor Smith, are facts, the stubbornness of which will not yield to any sophistical arguments, or special pleading whatever. The assertion of Major Ricketts, that"], [96, "68 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. the \" natives of Cape Coast were never conquered by the Ashantees,\" and the objection made by the local authorities to Dupuis' s treaty, on the alleged ground, that it transferred the sovereignty of the Fantee country to the king of Ashantee, \u2014 cannot annihilate the pubbshed despatch of Governor Smith, in which he had previously acknowledged the sovereign rights of the king over Fantee, (Fanti,) and, with the consent of the Fantee chiefs themselves, had transferred to him the notes for Annamaboe and Cape-Coast Castle, and bound himself to pay regularly to the king the ground** rents for those places. This full and unreserved admission of the king's claims upon Fantee con stituted, in fact, the very basis upon which Mr. Bowdich's treaty was concluded. A paragraph from the letters of Captain Laing sufficiently explains the course which Sir Charles McCarthy was induced to pursue. \" The natives of the Gold Coast,\" he remarks, \" soon comprehended the nature of our pobcy, as explained by Sir Charles M'Carthy, who was looked upon by them, in a very short time, as their debverer, both from internal and foreign oppression ; they beheld with satisfaction the pri vileges that were conferred upon them by the change ; and they had full confidence in the pro mises he made to them of British protection. The name of M'Carthy rung along the coast"], [97, "69 CHAPTER III. from Cape-Apollonia to the mouth of the Volta ; and the great influence which he gained over these people \u2014 the hitherto-acknowledged subjects of the king of Ashantee \u2014 was viewed with silent and gloomy indignation by that monarch, whose pride was not only stung at the sudden revolt of his subjects, acknowledged as such by British treaty, but at the neglect of his authority and dignity on the part of the British, in not sending to him a complimentary embassy.\" In thus proceeding to widen the breach and precipitate a crisis, by setting the king of Ashan tee at defiance, and exciting revolt among those who had hitherto been acknowledged as his sub jects, by British treaty, the new governor was doubtless induced to bebeve that the claims of the king in vindication of his honour, and in main tenance of his authority, could not have been con sistently conceded; but a feeling of regret, that Sir Charles did not first try the effect of peaceful measures, is perfectly consistent with a due appre ciation of the excellences which he combined in his character. The king of Ashantee had been placed in perplexing circumstances by the un happy disputes between the Company's govern ment and Mr. Dupuis ; and it was a matter of moment, that the national character of Britain should be placed before the barbarian sovereign in its true light. Considering the desire mani-"], [98, "70 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. fested by the court of Ashantee to maintain friendly intercourse with the British, it is not altogether improbable that the adoption of a peaceful pobcy would have been attended with success ; but if this had failed, the ultima ratio regum would then have been resorted to under circumstances more honourable to the British name. Had Sir Charles understood the true position of affairs, he would probably have pur sued such a course ; but he was placed in a trying situation. The servants of the Company which had just been abobshed by Act of Parliament, it would appear, had entered into a compact, not to accept office under, or hold any communication with, him; and Mr. Dupuis had failed to meet his earnest wishes for sub information on all the points in dispute. In these circumstances, he was left to explore his way as well as he cordd, and to adopt such measures as an imperfect acquaintance with the various matters in dispute might suggest. A considerable period elapsed before bostibties actuaby commenced. The king having, as it would appear, indulged the hope, that the new governor would pursue a different line of policy from that of his predecessor, remained in inactivity until his plans should become sufficiently manifest. Pre parations were then made for war by the Ashantee monarch, with the accustomed sacrifices, and con-"], [99, "71 CHAPTER III. sultation of the national deities ; and while these things were going on, the oath-draught, it was understood, was administered to the traders coming down from other parts of the coast, enjoin ing them to entire secrecy as to what was taking place in Ashantee. A dead sdence in consequence ensued, which the governor construed as a sign that the king was over-awed, and dared not attempt to carry his warbke threats into execution. The first act of hostility on the part of the Ash antees took place at Annamaboe, (Anamabii,) from the great square of which a Negro serjeant in the British service was carried off, on the pretence that he had spoken disrespectfully of the king. The governor, who, imagining that tranquillity was estabhshed, had gone to Sierra-Leone, returned to Cape-Coast Castle ; when Captain Laing nobly offered to proceed on an embassy either to Don qua, where the serjeant was confined, or to Coo massie itself, if that should be deemed necessary. Had this offer been accepted, it is not unlikely that important results would have foUowed, as it was afterwards understood that the king had resorted to this step only to try the temper of the British, and perhaps with the hope that it would bring about a negotiation. The governor, how ever, apprehensive for the captain's safety, decbned the offer, and neglected to take any other decisive step ; when the serjeant was executed ; and the"], [100, "72 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. king sent a message to the governor, that he would shortly convert his head into one of the ornaments of the royal death-drum of Ashantee. But even then he appeared unwilling to proceed to extremities until he had made another pacific overture. The Dutch governor at Elmina was the medium of this communication ; and a state ment of grievances was debvered by the Ashantee deputies, which statement, according to Captain Laing's own admission, contained much truth: but this attempt at negotiation proved abortive, and the war then commenced in reabty. At first, s\u00abgarate detachments only of the Ashantees malfe their appearance, over which Captain Eaing gained some decided advantages ; but those reverses had no other effect upon the king than to induce liim to make a more exten sive preparation for the struggle. He caUed upon his chiefs and vassals for a further augmentation of his troops, and sacrificed several human victims daily to ensure success. At this critical juncture, Sir Charles appeared disposed to pause ; and Cap tain Laing was of opinion, that had net some fatal counsels interposed, he would have endea voured to arrest the further progress of the war by friendly negotiation. The golden opportunity was, however, unhappily neglected, and intelli gence was ere long received, that the Ashantees were rapidly advancing through Wassaw, and that"], [101, "73 CHAPTER III. the allied native forces were precipitately retreat ing before them towards the coast. The governor was at the camp at Djuquah when these tidings were announced, and he imme diately determined to cross the Prah, and meet the enemy. Without waiting for the arrival of the troops, who were with Major Chisholm, at the camp at Ampensasu, he accordingly pushed for ward with the whole of the force which he had with him at Djuquah, and a body of armed na tives under their own captains. Having crossed the Prah, he waited a few days at Assamacow, and sent his secretary, Mr. Williams, to inform the retreating Wassaws and DenJ^erans of his ad vance, and to persuade them to halt, and await his arrival. With much difficulty, the secretary pre vailed upon them to remain at a spot which he had chosen for a camp, on the bank of a small river, towards which place the governor shortly proceeded ; but before his arrival an alarm was given that the Ashantees were approaching. A messenger was immediately despatched to him ; but he had unfortunately formed too low an esti mate of the mibtary skill and courage of the Ashantees, and treated the inteUigence as an idle report. He, however, reached the camp on the morning of the following day, January 21, 1824, and the horns and drums of the advancing enemy were shortly heard. Having been induced, by i"], [102, "74 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. some information which he had received, to be lieve that many of the Ashantees were disposed to join him at the first opportunity, Sir Charles ordered the bugles to sound, and the band of the Royal African corps to play \" God save the King ; \" to which the Ashantee chiefs responded only in warlike strains, as they marched their divisions down to the opposite bank of the river. The Ashantee chiefs are distinguished in battle by their own peculiar military airs; and, on this occasion, a native from Coomassie, who was in the British camp, was able, on hearing the music, to tell the name of every chief as he advanced. The battle commenced with great spirit on both sides, and a heavy filing was kept up across the river, until the troops under the governor's imme diate command had nearly exhausted then ammu nition. The enemy then attempted to cross the river, but were received with the bayonet, and repulsed with great slaughter. A large body, how ever, having, at an earber part of the day, crossed the river higher up, for the purpose of cutting off the retreat of the governor, now attacked his forces on the flank and in the rear, and literally cut them to pieces. Sir Charles, who had himself received several wounds, seeing all was lost on his side, retired to that part of the field where the king of Denkera and his people were still bravely"], [103, "75 CHAPTER III. resisting the enemy. An attempt was then made to check the Ashantees by discharging a field piece among them ; but nothing could resist their progress; and the Denkerans were compelled to give way, while Sir Charles and some of his officers vainly endeavoured to effect their retreat through the woods. They had proceeded only a short distance, when they were assailed by a party of the enemy, by whose fire Sir Charles had an arm broken, and was wounded in the chest. Mr. Williams also, his secretary, shortly feU, stunned by a ball ; but was recovered to his senses by the application of the Ashantee knife. At this criti cal moment, when a sbght gash had actually been made in the back of his neck, a captain came up who recognised Mr. Williams as a friend from whom he had formerly experienced kindness, and gave command that his life should be spared. On looking round, Mr. Williams witnessed the appalling sight of the headless trunks of Governor M'Carthy, Mr. Buckle, and Mr. Wetherell. He remained for some time a prisoner in the Ashan tee camp ; during the whole of which period, he was regularly locked up at night in the same place with the heads of bis unfortunate com panions, which, by some peculiar process, were kept in a state of perfect preservation. Sir Charles's head presented nearly the same appear- e 2"], [104, "76 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. ance as when alive. As to his body, it is stated, that his heart was eaten by the principal Ashantee chiefs, in order that they might, as they imagined, imbibe his bravery; and his flesh, having been dried, was divided, together with his bones, among the men of consequence in the army, who kept their respective shares about their persons, as charms to inspire them with courage. Whenever they executed any of their prisoners, Mr. Wilbams was placed on one side of the great death-drum, while they decapitated the unfortu- nate victim on the other. One of the prisoners, Captain Raydon of the Cape-Coast militia, met with a peculiar fate. He had received five wounds in the action; and five being, in such cases, the sacred number, he was sacrificed to the fetish. Captain Ricketts, and Mr. De Graft, the linguist, then acting as beutenant of militia, succeeded in making their escape from the field of battle ; and, aided by a native guide, they at length reached a village, where they met Major Chisholm, who had set out from the camp at Ampensasu, with a view to reinforce the army of the governor : but having heard of his defeat, the major resolved to retire to Cape-Coast Castle, to which place he expected the victorious Ashantees would immediately urge their way. Captain Laing, who had been out in another direction, on receiving tidings of the governor's defeat, also"], [105, "CHAPTER III. 77 hastened to Cape Coast, and great exertions were made to place it in a state of defence, and collect a sufficient force to meet the enemy. But, although thirty thousand natives had taken arms in support of the common cause, the victory of the Ashantees produced such a general feeling of dismay, that only few appeared willing to enter the field against them. Instead of improving their decisive victory by an attack upoi- Cape Coast, the Ashantees mani fested a desire to renew friendly relations with the British. Although they were still fifteen thou sand strong, and were well prepared for the prosecution of the war, they halted a few miles from the field of action; and, after a little delay, they engaged the Dutch governor Last, at Elmina, to write to Cape-Coast Castle, inviting a conference for the purpose of negotiating a peace. Captain Ricketts, accordingly, proceeded to Elmina, and met the Ashantee deputies, who stated that their sovereign had not sent his army to fight with the Whites, but to bring him Kujoh Chibbu, \u2014 the vice-king of Denkera, \u2014 and the chiefs of Tueful, and Wassaw, who had revolted from him; that if these were debvered up, the army would immediately return ; but that if this condition should be rejected, they had orders to take Kujoh Chibbu, in particular, by force of arms, although he might be locked up in Cape-"], [106, "78 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Coast Castle. They also positively denied that the king had given orders to execute the British serjeant at Donqua; and declared that the act was perpetrated by those Fantees who were at that time acting in unison with the Ashantee troops. Captain Ricketts having repbed, it was agreed that hostilities should not be re-commenced while the negotiation was pend ing, and the deputies returned to the camp. Before the conference broke up, Governor Last, having learned that Mr. Wilbams was still abve, requested the deputies to inform their general that he would best evince his sincerity, in offering to make peace with the British, by sending the prisoner back to his friends. And in about a week, Mr. Wilbams was brought to Elmina in a state of nudity, with his hands tied behind his back, and debvered up to the Dutch governor. This negotiation was attended with no other practical result. Kujoh Chibbu, afraid that he should experience the fate of Asin Chibbu, and, like that unfortunate chief, be debvered up as a peace-offering to the Ashantees, although repeat edly assured that his fears were groundless, resolved upon crossing the Prah, and attacking the enemy. Arrangements were made, by the British officer in command, to support this move ment ; but it had no other effect than to arouse the Ashantees again to action, who shortly fought"], [107, "CHAPTER III. 79 their way down into the neighbourhood of Cape- Coast Castle. At this juncture, Lieutenant-Colonel Suther land arrived with a body of troops ; and prepara tions were immediately made for attacking the Ashantee army before the arrival of the king, who was understood to be on his way down from Coomassie, with a strong reinforcement. The marines were accordingly landed from the squa dron, by whom the castle and towers were garrisoned, and the whole of the mibtary, with the native allies, proceeded to attack the enemy. A hard-fought battle took place, which was not attended by any decisive advantage on either side ; and on the following day, the native forces having generally dispersed, Colonel Sutherland recalled the troops within the walls of the castle. At the same time, the king of Ashantee joined his army ; and it was then ascertained, that Osai Tutu Quamina was no more, having died a natural death, at Coomassie, shortly after the commence ment of hostilities against the British. The new king, Osai Ockoto, the brother of the deceased monarch, shortly after his arrival at the camp, having sent a message of defiance to the governor, advanced with his whole army so near to Cape-Coast Castle as to be distinctly seen on the heights. The most vigorous exertions were made to put the place in a state of defence. AU"], [108, "80 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. the male inhabitants of the town were ordered to offer the most determined resistance; and the seamen and marines from His Majesty's ship \"Vic tor,\" and the seamen from merchant-vessels in the roads, were landed to man the guns, and aid in opposing the enemy. And, in a few days, this force was strengthened, by the arrival of another ship of war, with men and officers of the Royal African corps. About five thousand armed natives from Accra, (Akrah,) besides others of the natives albes from different places, also arrived about the same time. Another general engagement took place, which was only terminated by the darkness of night. It was expected that the action would be renewed the following day ; but the dreadful ra vages of the small-pox and dysentery, and the want of provisions, had produced such a feeling of dissatisfaction in the Ashantee army, that the king deemed it prudent to withdraw. The same causes were, at the same time, producing the most fearful effects in Cape-Coast town, and in the castle, within the walls of which many thou sands of native women and children were cooped up, to preserve them from the fury of the enemy. The scene was too painful to be described; and, had it not been for the timely arrival of a partial supply of provisions from Sierra Leone, and that some vessels had been despatched from England with rice, famine must have swept off those whom"], [109, "CHAPTER III. 81 disease had spared : for the Ashantees had reduced the surrounding country to a perfect wilderness. About two years after this period, in the month of September, 1826, another, and, as it proved, decisive, battle was fought near the village of Dodowah, twenty-four miles north-east of British Accra, between ten thousand Ashantees and eleven thousand British and albed native troops. The Ashantees were the assailants, and fought with desperate bravery. About the middle of the day, they were driving back the centre of the allied army; when Colonel Purdon brought up the reserve, and met them with discharges of rockets and grape-shot. The rockets, in a great measure, decided the contest. The Ashantees, having never before witnessed the effect of those formidable engines of destruction, were thrown into confusion ; and, although they continued the battle through the day, they were not able to rally again. Many of their principal chiefs were killed ; and the whole of their camp and baggage fell into the hands of the allies. Among the trophies was a human head, enveloped in a silk handkerchief, and a paper covered with Arabic characters; and over the whole was thrown a tiger skin, the emblem of royalty. On the suppo sition that this was the head of the unfortunate Sir Charles M'Carthy, it was afterwards sent to e 5"], [110, "82 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. England by Colonel Purdon; but it was really the head of Osai Tutu Quamina, which the new king carried about with him as a charm. It is said, that, on the morning of the battle, he offered to it a hbation of rum, and invoked it to cause all the heads of the Whites to come and be near it ; and it is further stated, that, during the day, when intelligence was brought to him of the death of any of his principal officers, he immedi ately, in the heat of the battle, offered human sacrifices to their shades. After this action, the albed troops lay on their arms all night ; the king having been seen at the close of the day walking in front, as though he was meditating some desperate enterprise ; but, instead of renewing the attack, he withdrew the remainder of his army, and returned to Coo massie. The native albes of the British mani fested no disposition to pursue him, but retired to Accra (Akrah) with the booty which they had obtained. In a few days, the new governor, Sir Neil Campbell, who had succeeded General Turner, landed at Cape-Coast Castle; and one of his first acts was to send for Kujoh Chibbu, who had greatly distinguished himself in the battle, and the other principal native chiefs, to thank them for their brave and successful exertions, aud to propose to them that peace should be made with"], [111, "CHAPTER III. 83 the Ashantees. Independently of higher con siderations, this was the truest policy which he could possibly adopt ; for it was obvious, that the native albes could not be depended upoii for the continuance of the war. Major Ricketts confi dently asserts, that had the Ashantees delayed for a few weeks their attack upon the allied forces, their overthrow could not have taken place; for the native union would have melted away, and the Ashantees wotdd have been left in undisputed possession of the country. The chiefs objected to proposals of peace being made to the king of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) although the governor assured them that no treaty would be concluded, except on the condition that their safety and interests were secured. At length, he told them that the orders which he had received from the king of England to put an end to the war, were peremptory ; and, dismissing them, made arrangements to send messengers direct to Coo- massie, (Kumasi,) with a view to improve the recent victory by negotiating an honourable and lasting peace : but this conciliatory plan was de- feated by the continued opposition of the chiefs. At length, however, by a combination of favourable circumstances, Major Ricketts succeeded in open ing a negotiation; when the terms proposed to the king, with the approbation of Kujoh Chibbu and the other native leaders, were, that he should"], [112, "84 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. lodge four thousand ounces of gold in the Castle at Cape-Coast, to be appropriated in purchasing ammunition and arms for the use of the British albes, in case the Ashantees should again com mence hostibties; and that two of the royal family of Ashantee, whose names were mentioned, should be sent to Cape-Coast as hostages. To these terms the king of Ashantee, although manifesting a great desire to be at peace with the British, was evidently unwilling to accede, and the negotiation languished for years; until, at length, in the month of April, 1831, the king sent down to Cape-Coast Castle one of his own sons, named Quantamissah, and Ansah, son of the late king, as hostages, with six hundred ounces of gold to be lodged there as a security for bis future good conduct; and thus virtually abandoned the claim which, on the ground of previous conquest, he had previously urged against the natives upon the coast."], [113, "CHAPTER IV.

Meredith, in the quotation previously given, foUows Bosman and Barbot in substituting the . for the h, and writes the name \" Asiante ; \" which is a nearer approach to the true orthogra phy than Ashantee. At all events, if the aspirate be retained, it should commence the second sylla ble, and the word should be expressed as though it were written, As-hanti, the first syllable being articulated as rapidly as possible, and the last like ty in duty. The accent is on the penultimate. With respect to the first syllable, it may be added, that Bowdich, Hutton, and Dupuis, when quoting the exact language used by the king on certain occasions, altogether drop the a ; and certain it is, that in the pronunciation of the word by the two Ashantee princes, Quan tamissah and Ansah, little else is heard in the first syUable, but the hissing sound of the s. The empire of Ashantee is not so much one State placed immediately under one government, as an assemblage of States owing a kind of feudal obedience to the sovereign of Ashantee. Accord ing to Dupuis, the empire extends westward from the River Volta about four geographical degrees, and, reckoning from the neighbourhood of the coast, four degrees of latitude ; comprising an area of about sixty thousand square miles. Over the"], [115, "CHAPTER IV. 87 whole of the countries within these bmits, the king of Ashantee, he says, exercises supreme sway ; all kings, viceroys, or caboceers, being his absolute and unconditional vassals, as tributaries or not ; and most of them holding their governments by virtue of an appointment from the court. The opinion entertained by Bowdich, that Dwabin, or Juabin, only about a day's journey from Coomassie, (Ku masi,) is an independent kingdom, is repudiated by Dupuis, who states, that the king of Ashantee was greatly irritated when he (Dupuis) expressed a wish to see him, indignantly demanding whether there was any other king than himself; and declar ing, that if Bowdicb's treaty represented the chief of Dwabin as king, it was a gross imposition. Dupuis adds, that he is not even entitled by courtesy to the title of Ohen, (the Ashantee word for king,) although the tributary rulers of Banna and Gaman both use it. Whether this be correct or not, it will be seen, on reference to the signa ture of Bowdich's treaty, that his name is append ed without the royal appeUation of Osai, which is invariably used by all the kings of Ashantee. The fact, that the chief of Dwabin is united by the ties of consanguinity to the royal famfly of Ashantee, is sufficient to account for those atten tions shown him by the king, which Bowdich mistook as a recognition of his independence. In marking out the boundaries of the empire,"], [116, "88 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Dupuis does not, however, make the Volta the bmit of the king of Ashantee's influence in that direction; for Inta, or Ghunja, the capital of which is Salgha, and Dagumba, whose metropolis is Yahndi, are albed with Ashantee. Bowdich says, the kings of Inta and Dagumba are excused from attending in person at the annual yam-cus- tom celebrated in Coomassie ; but they send some of their principal caboceers to represent them on that great national occasion. He states, more- over, that the capitals, and other large towns of these two countries, pay, as an annual tribute to the king of Ashantee, five hundred slaves, two hundred cows, four hundred sheep, four hundred cotton cloths, and two hundred silk and cotton cloths; and that the smaller towns are propor- tionately taxed. In the enumeration which Dupuis gives of the tributary princes and allies to whom, on one occasion, the king was despatch- ing presents, both Inta and Dagumba are men- tioned ; and some of the subjects of the latter State are represented as being actually in at- tendance at Coomassie, who formally presented thanks to the king for a former present which he had sent to their sovereign. On the same occasion, the king told Dupuis, that he had sent to the king of Dagumba for fifty girls, and fifty boys, (some of whom had already reached Coomassie,) whom he should dress in rich clothes"], [117, "CHAPTER IV. 89 and gold, and send as a present to the king of England. And, in his chapter on the geography of Western Africa, while he says that Yahndi is not a part of the empire of Ashantee, he admits that Ashantee influence carries great weight in the councils of the sovereign of Dagumba, and expressly mentions Inta, or Ghunja, as a province, and again as a tributary, of Ashantee ; and, after giving the names of Salgha, the chief city, and several frontier towns on the Dahoman side, he explicitly maintains, that although the people of all these places are left to the government of their caboceers, and the jurisdiction of their own laws, yet are they compelled, whether Moslems or Heathens, to serve in the wars of Ashantee. Inta, or Ghunja, therefore, if not Dagumba, ought to be included within the Ashantee empire, as weU as the other dependencies, and its limits must be regarded as proportionately extended to the eastward of the Volta river. Adverting again to the pobtical constitution of the Ashantee empire, it may be remarked, that others of the dependent States, as well as Inta, or Ghunja, are left under their former laws, as administered by a native ruler. But the people have the privilege of appealing from their own tribunals, and claiming a judgment upon their respective cases, according to the laws of Ashantee ; and over every one of these States"], [118, "90 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. an Ashantee chief is placed, who is held respon sible by the king for the conduct of the native ruler. This superior chief generally resides at Coomassie, and seldom visits his province except to receive the tribute. To the oppressive conduct of the superior chiefs may be principally ascribed that spirit of dissatisfaction and revolt which so frequently manifests itself in the dependencies of the empire. The king of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) although represented as a despotic monarch, having the hves and property of his subjects at his abso lute disposal, is not, in all respects, beyond control. He is placed in a situation somewhat similar to the kings of the ancient Medes and Persians ; among whom it was a principle, that what had once passed into law, the power of the sovereign himself could not change. The impe rative mandate of Darius was quite sufficient instantaneously to consign to the jaws of the lions all the individuals, and their wives and children, who had been the occasion of procuring the decree for the ruin of the prophet Daniel ; but the ut most power of the king could not save the prophet himself from its operation.* Now, the kmg of Ashantee is under a somewhat similar obhgation * Daniel vi. 14\u2014 24."], [119, "CHAPTER IV. 91 to observe the national customs which have been handed down to the people from remote anti quity ; and a practical disregard of this obligation, in the attempt to change some of the customs of their forefathers, cost Osai Quamina his throne. The caboceers and captains, moreover, claim to be heard on all questions relating to war and foreign pobtics. Such matters are considered in a general assembly; and the king sometimes finds it prudent to yield to the views and urgent representations of the majority. Four individuals, representing the general assembly of caboceers and captains, signed Bowdich's treaty at the same time with the king himself, after it had been agreed upon at a full meeting of the caboceers, tributary princes, and captains. And Dupuis states, that the treaty which he afterwards nego tiated at Coomassie (Kumasi) was criticised and scrutinized by a full court of the principal nobles and captains, and was the subject of a most labo rious discussion, before it obtained the royal sig nature. The Ashantees advocate the participa tion of the caboceers and captains in the consi deration and management of war and foreign pohcy, on the principle, that it makes the nation more formidable to its enemies, who feel that they cannot offer provocation with impunity, where there are so many guardians of the mihtary glory. But while the caboceers and captains, in their"], [120, "92 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. collective capacity, possess considerable influence in the management of questions relating to foreign pobcy, as individuals they are subject to the most despotic authority, and frequently become the victims of the jealousy or displeasure of the king. A few cases of recent occurrence will sufficiently illustrate the temper of the chiefs, and the character of the Ashantee go vernment. When the king of Ashantee con quered Wassaw, he placed the king, or prin cipal chief of that country, under the care of Apraku, the captain of Bantama ; and the captive chief so ingratiated himself with his guardian, or keeper, that he obtained permission from him to return to his own country. It was presumed that, in the lapse of years, the captive was almost forgotten, and that his withdrawal would not even come under the notice of the king ; or that, should he become acquainted with the transaction, it would not call forth any serious expression of dissatisfaction. The event proved the fallacy of the hopes which were thus entertained. The king was immediately informed of what had hap pened, and required from Apraku an immediate explanation. But the answer of the guardian chief, so far from being deemed satisfactory, was regarded as wanting in due respect for the king's authority; and his life became the forfeiture of his two-fold offence."], [121, "CHAPTER IV. 93 Shortly after this affair, another of the most dis tinguished caboceers or nobles bkewise perished. Dampti, general of the household troops, sur named Boadaban, or \"bark-breaker,\" an appella tion figuratively descriptive of his military prowess, had become an object of the king's jealousy, partly, if not exclusively, on account of his wealth. Aware of the danger to be apprehended from falling under the suspicion or displeasure of his sovereign, he determined to strike the first blow, and formed a conspiracy to attack and burn the capital. But before this plan could be carried into effect, the whole plot was discovered to the king, and Dampti's neck was submitted to the stroke of the executioner. The chief or bashaw of the Moors was impbcated in this conspiracy, and was, in consequence, a prisoner in his own house, chained to a log of wood, at the time when the Rev. Mr. Freeman visited Coomassie. The king of Ashantee maintains such an effi cient system of espionage, that it is difficult for his subjects to speak or act in any manner derogatory to his authority without his being made acquainted with the offence. He employs a number of clever boys, trained for the purpose, who are placed as spies upon the conduct of the great men, and convey to the king a report of all they see and hear. While Mr. Freeman was at the frontier town of Fdmunah, waiting for permission to go"], [122, "94 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. up to the capital, some of those boys were ' in attendance upon him. When he was at meals, one would enter, and, placing himself at a dis tance, would silently mark all that passed; and wherever Mr. Freeman went, he had reason to bebeve that his proceedings were subject to their scrutiny. Offending or suspected chiefs are most fre- quently caUed to account when the yam-custom takes place. At that great annual festival aU the caboceers and captains, and the greater number ofthe tributary kings or chiefs, are expected to appear in the capital ; and the nobles or captains against whom the king has cause of complaint are then placed upon their trial. Often, on those and similar occasions, a chief goes up without any suspicion that he has excited the jealousy or displeasure of the king, when he is met with charges founded on the reports which have been conveyed to the palace, and degradation or death is the usual result. This was the case of a distin- guished caboceer, whose trial Bowdich witnessed. Apia Nanu, the general of an army which had been employed on distant service, returned to the capital; and a fit opportunity presenting itself, he was publicly accused of having spoken disre- spectfully of the king. He denied the charge; when he was confronted by witnesses, who had heard him, while absent with the army, complain"], [123, "95 CHAPTER IV. of the conduct of the king, and who had been kept in a secluded part of the forest in order that they might surprise and confound him by their sudden and unlooked-for appearance when he should be placed upon his trial. To speak disrespectfully of the king is a trea sonable offence, which, from the facilities pos sessed for obtaining information, seldom escapes detection; and, when discovered, is ever visited with severe punishment. A reference to the state of feeling among the Ashantees on the subject of unbecoming language used towards the sove reign, and the difficulty of committing this offence without detection, may enable the bibbcal reader to enter more fully into the meaning of the inspired preacher : \" Curse not the king ; no, not in thy thought ; and curse not the rich in thy bed-chamber ; for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.\" * Apia Nanu, not being able to rebut the evidence of his accusers, was deprived of his stool, \u2014 the emblem of his dignity, \u2014 and of the whole of his property ; but he was aUowed to retire with three wives and ten slaves. The sequel strikingly illustrates the notions of honour which are pre valent among the Ashantees. On the following * Ecclesiastes x. 20."], [124, "96 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. day, the king, who considered that none but the meanest spirits could endure to bve after severe disgrace, on hearing that the degraded caboceer still bngered in tbe capital, exclaimed that no man who was actuated by a proper feeling would bear so much shame before aU the people, rather than abandon his home ; and ordered that, as an additional punishment for this baseness, only one wife should be left to him. This was more than the high spirit of Apia Nanu was able to brook, and he immediately became his own executioner. Sometimes a chief who suspects that he has become obnoxious to the king, will not trust him self in tbe capital without the means of defence or intimidation. A powerful caboceer might be named, who, on a recent visit to Coomassie, (Kumasi,) impressed with the critical circum stances in which he was placed, as an object of the king's jealousy, deemed it prudent to take with him three thousand armed attendants. The king bas the property, as well as the fives, of his people within his power. He is the legal heir of all his subjects, whose gold he can claim at their death. Bowdich's story of Aga recognises this pecuharity in Ashantee law, and shows too that the king is not always patient enough to wait for the natural death of his rich subjects. On one occasion, it appears, Osai Tutu Quamina"], [125, "CHAPTER IV. 97 acknowledged that he entertained a prejudice against a wealthy captain; when his principal linguists, always inchned to support him, said, \" If you wish to take his stool from him, we will make the palaver.\" But Aga, who had singu larly gained the king's confidence, immediately sprung up and exclaimed, \"No, king, that is not good. That man never did you any wrong. You know, ab the gold of your subjects is yours at their death ; but if you get all now, strangers wib go away and say, ' Only the king has gold ; ' and that wdl not be good. But let them say, ' The king has gold, ab his captams have gold, and all his people have gold ; ' then your country will look handsome, and the bush people wiU fear you.\" It is recorded to the honour of Osai Tutu Qua mina, who, whatever might be his faults, possessed some noble quabties, that this individual, Aga, had secured his confidence by his fearless honesty. He was a poor boy who earned salt from Aquomo to Coomassie for sale ; and, being taken into the service of the caboceer of that place, he was present when his master was brought before the king on a charge wrongfully preferred against him at the instance of the government. The caboceer being confused by the misrepresentations of the king's officers, the boy Aga suddenly started up and said, \" King, you have people to F"], [126, "98 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. wash you, to feed you, to serve you ; but you have no people to speak the truth to you, and tell you when God does not like your palaver.\" Immediately an unanimous cry arose in the assembly, that he ought to be carried out, and have his bead struck off; but the king com- manded him to proceed ; and Aga, in a speech of three hours, convinced the king of the innocence of his master, and obtained his acquittal. The king then took Aga into his own service ; and, baring had further proof of his abibty and inte- grity, appointed him to the office of linguist, and presented liim with wives and slaves, a house, and gold to support his estabbshment. And as an addi tional reward for his honesty in the case first men tioned, the king raised him to the rank of second linguist, and greatly increased his property. Mr. Hutchinson had an opportunity of witnessing the boldness of this individual. The king having detected the misconduct of one of his captains, wrought himself up to such a height of passion, that none of the chiefs dared to arise in his presence, till Aga stood up, and, in his usual energetic manner, requested His Majesty to remember that an Engbshman was the witness of his conduct. To return from this digression : It is stated that the king usuaby takes a considerable por tion of the gold which a deceased caboceer has"], [127, "99 CHAPTER IV. left behind him in dust ; leaving to his suc cessor only a small amount. Sometimes a chief will attempt to defraud the king of his claim, by presenting to his children large sums of gold, when he imagines himself to be near death ; aud Bowdich mentions the son of one who dis played, with impunity, the property which he had thus acquired ; but this, it may be presumed, was a somewhat hazardous experiment. The rich nobles, however, convert a consider able portion of their gold into ornaments, which usually descend to theh successors ; \u2014 although not invariably, for even these, whether manu factured or otherwise, are occasionally taken away. The principal matter of which Apia Nanu had complained against the king, was, that on the death of his brother, to whose stool he had suc ceeded, the king had claimed some rock-gold, which belonged to the inheritance, and had doubtless been worn among the ornaments of the family; for on state occasions, many of the nobles appear with rude lumps of rock-gold suspended from their left wrists. But, it is to be remarked, that if the ornaments of the chiefs are generally allowed to descend to their heirs, the king has a check upon his subjects to prevent them from multiplying such articles so as whoby to defraud him of his claims at their decease. On every occasion, when a chief adds to f 2"], [128, "100 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. his stock of ornaments, he has to pay a tax to the king, amounting, as appears from an instance quoted by Bowdich, to one-fifth of the value of the gold thus appropriated. Once in their life-time those caboceers and principal men who are favourites of the king, and bebeve themselves to be free from palavers, make a pubbe exhibition of their riches, in a noisy procession through the pubbe places of the capital. Mr. Hutchinson had the opportunity of witness ing the display which Apdko made on such an occasion. Among the articles which he noticed were gold chains for the neck, arms, and legs ; ornaments of all descriptions for the ankles, con sisting of manacles with keys, beUs, chains, and padlocks; armlets and various ornaments for his numerous family of wives, children, and captains ; a superb war-cap of eagles' feathers, fetishes, (which will be hereafter explained,) Moorish charms, caps, and sflk dresses ; purses, bags, and other articles made of monkey-skin; fans, with ivory handles, made of tiger-skin, and decorated with silk; gold swords, and figures of birds, beasts, and fishes, of the same metal; ivory arrows and bows, covered with silk and skin ; drums, and various instruments of music, covered with tiger-skin, and having red belts ; aud many other weapons of war, and articles .suited to the taste of the owner. The orna-"], [129, "101 CHAPTER IV. ments made of gold weighed upwards of sixteen hundred ounces. The income of the king must be very large, for the produce of the gold mines is not private pro perty, but belongs to the Crown ; although this would be much greater were the mines better worked. The customs paid by those who engage in trade, the taxes from the provinces, and tribute received from conquered nations, are a further augmentation of the royal revenue. The gold contained in the soil of the market-place of Coo massie is also the property of the king. On two occasions, in the reign of Osai Tutu' Quamina, the washing of the soil yielded about sixteen hundred ounces of gold. Frequently after a heavy rain, lumps of gold are laid bare, but they are carefully covered up again, as the person who should take any would expose himself to the penalty of death. While Bowdich was at the capital, an individual was actuaUy beheaded for picking up a piece of gold in the market-place. The court of Ashantee (As-hanti) affords a more striking display of barbarous splendour than any of the principal courts in the interior. Those of Eyeo, or Yarriba, Sackatoo, (Sakatu,) and Bornou, as they are described by travebers, are far less imposing in appearance. The court of Ashantee is seen to advantage on the pubbe reception of"], [130, "102 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. visitors at the capital. The king is magnificently attired in silk, with necklaces, bracelets, knee bands and ankle-strings of gold and beads, and many other ornaments, some of which are in mas sive gold, and others are ingenious devices and representations debcately wrought in the same metal. With these a variety of charms are inter mingled. His fingers are covered with gold rings, and he has been seen to wear on his finger and thumb a pair of gold castanets, by the clap ping of which he enforced sdence. The manners of all the Ashantee kings known to Europeans have been uniformly represented as dignified yet courteous. The royal throne, or \" stool,\" is bterally covered with plates of gold. Behind the king are his guards, with belts encased in gold, having orna ments of the same metal representing jaw-bones ; and the muskets of the guards are also covered with gold. There too are placed the royal mes sengers, with breast-plates of gold, koldnig in a reversed position their large crooked sabres, so as to render conspicuous the golden hilts. The prin cipal officers of the king's household display a splendour in accordance with their rank. The keeper of the treasury is known by the blow-pan, boxes, scales, and weights, all of sobd gold, which are exhibited in his retinue. Gold canes, tied in bundles bke fasces, and elevated in all directions"], [131, "103 CHAPTER IV. by their numerous attendants, distinguish the four linguists. The chamberlain, the gold-horn blower, the captain of the messengers, the captain for royal executions, the captain of the market, the keeper of the royal burial-ground, all sit sur rounded by the emblems of their respective offices, and attended by a large retinue. The royal cook also displays a number of table-services, punch bowls, tankards, waiters, and other utensils of massive silver plate. The okras, slaves peculiarly devoted to the king, and various other officers, are adorned with large stars, crescents, and gossa mer wings of sobd gold. And, to complete the bst of persons in immediate attendance upon the sovereign, as well as to exhibit the union of bar barism and magnificence, must be mentioned the royal chief-executioner, a man of gigantic size, bearing a massive golden hatchet, and having exhibited before him the execution-stool, clotted with human blood, and partly covered with a cawl of fat. The appearance of the caboceers and their principal captains and attendants is imposing. Many of them wear Ashantee cloths of great value, manufactured from costly foreign silks, which have been unravelled, in order to weave them anew with every variety of colour and figure. These robes are of great size and weight, and are thrown over the shoulder like the Roman toga."], [132, "104 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. A profusion of gold necklaces, and other orna ments, mixed with charms, are also worn by the nobles ; and to their left wrists are attached rude lumps of rock-gold which, on account of their weight, are supported on the heads of their hand somest boys, who are selected for this office. Like the sovereign, they wear sandals of leather, of various colours. They are also surrounded by a great number of attendants, some bearing gold headed canes, and others swords with gold han dles, from which are suspended representations of the beads of wolves and rams, as large as life, cast in gold. And their stools, the emblems of their dignity, which descend to their successors, made of wood, elaborately carved, from each of which two beUs are suspended, are on these occasions con spicuously exhibited on the heads of confidential officers, around whom are seated crowds of boys flourishing elephants' tails curiously mounted. The tails of elephants are ensigns of distinction, which are sometimes borne by sons of the king before the principal caboceers. Osai Tutu Quamina had, when a boy, carried an elephant's tail before Apdko. The elephants' tails waved before the sovereign are spangled with golden ornaments. The captains attend in then war dresses, each of which consists of a cap with gilded horns projecting in front, and adorned with im mense plumes of ostrich feathers; a vest of red"], [133, "105 CHAPTER IV. cloth covered with fetishes, charms, aud various ornaments; and loose cotton trousers, with im mense boots of dull red leather, reaching half-way up the thigh, aud fastened by small chains to their cartouch or belt. The caboceers, as well as the king, are shaded by immense umbrebas, many of which are large enough to cover twenty or thirty persons. These are made of the most showy cloths and silks, and are crowned at the top with emblematical representations of birds and beasts, either gilt or of sobd gold. The interest on pubbe occasions is not unfre quently heightened by the presence of some of the tributary kings and princes. Bowdich saw the court of the king of Dwabin, or Juabin, when on a visit at Coomassie, and represents it as almost equally crowded with that of the king of Ashan tee. And when Dupuis made his pubbe entrance into the capital, he witnessed the king of Banna, surrounded by a numerous and splendid retinue, seated near to his bege lord. The stool of this monarch was covered with sdver plates, none being permitted to sit enthroned in gold but the sove reign prince of the whole empire. Every caboceer or noble has his band of music, and, as the visitant approaches, it plays his own peculiar air or tune, by which he is distinguished from bis compeers ; and in these bands are drums adorned with thigh-bones, teeth, and other human f 5"], [134, "106 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. rebcs. Each of these drums is carried on the head of one man, and beaten by two others. The simultaneous playing of such a number of bands, accompanied with discharges of musketry and other sounds, produces an almost deafening noise. After the visitant has performed the laborious task of saluting in succession all the distinguished personages present, and last of all the king, he is then conducted to a distance, and placed in a convenient situation to receive their salutations in return. Another scene then takes place, baffling all adequate description. The caboceers pass, according to their respective ranks, fobowed by their captains and retinue. Each noble is at tended by his flatterers, who proclaim, in boister ous songs, the \" strong names \" of their master, while his band plays in warbke strains, and various dances are performed. The chiefs courteously salute the stranger as they pass. On the occasion alluded to, when the king of Banna was present, as that monarch approached Dupuis, having com manded silence by an authoritative wave of the baud, he snatched a scimitar from one of his attendants, and, commencing a violent dance, in which he wrought himself up to a height of fury, he loudly dwelt upon the warlike achievements of his sovereign lord. Women sang of the thousands and tens of thousands slain in battle by Saul and"], [135, "107 CHAPTER IV. David;* but the military glory of Ashantee's king was thus proclaimed by a monarch only inferior to himself. The king and his attendants close the proces sion. AU his officers of state display their re spective insignia as they pass along; among which are prominent the executioners, with then blood-stained stools, and the great death-drum, decorated with jaw-bones and skulls of vanquished foes. This drum is beaten at the moment when a human victim is beheaded. The people web under stand its sound. On one occasion, when Mr. Free man was in a distant part of the capital, the drum was heard ; on which his interpreter said, \" Hark ! do you hear the drum ? A sacrifice has just been made, and the drum says, ' King, I have killed him.' \" A circumstance occurred on Mr. Free man's pubbe reception, which forcibly illustrates Ashantee manners. The king had saluted Mr. Freeman with great courteousness as he passed ; but he had not proceeded many paces, when he suddenly snatched a sabre from one of his attend ants, and aimed a violent blow at an individual who was beating a drum. The drummer, terri fied, ran and placed himself under the protection of a powerful caboceer, who, as Mr. Freeman afterwards learned, pleaded for him; when the * 1 Samuel xviii. 7."], [136, "108 \u2022ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. king consented to spare his life, but sentenced him to lose an ear, saying, \" The drum ought to have been played properly, in honour of the Engbshman wbo had paid him a visit ! \" At those state-exhibitions, the market-place, which is about a mile in circumference, is gene raby crowded. Mr. Freeman calculated that forty thousand persons, half of whom were soldiers, were present at bis pubbe reception. Such a length of time is* occupied with the formalities which etiquette prescribes on those occasions, that the day sometimes closes before they are con cluded ; and the glare of torches, winch are fed by oil contained in vessels of gold, and the brilbant glow of the stars in an African sky, throw a new interest over the extraordinary scene. That the king should be able to parade so large a body of troops on pubbe occasions, will not cause surprise, when it is remembered that the Ashantees are a nation of warriors ; all the males being trained to arms from their youth. Bowdich calculates that Ashantee Proper can alone send two hundred and four thousand soldiers into the field ; and its cbsposable force, since the Ashantee invasions, has been estimated by old residents at upwards of one hundred and fifty thousand. The discipbne of the Ashantee army has ever been spoken of with commendation by the Engbsh, as"], [137, "109 CHAPTER IV. often as they have had opportunity to witness it. When the Ashantees first came down to the sea, in the year 1807, the governor and his officers, on entering into negotiation with the king at Anna maboe, (Anamabii,) were surprised to find, not only that the king himself was pobte and weU behaved, but tbat he and his troops understood and observed the rules of war as they are main tained among civibzed people. And Mr. Wil bams, the secretary of the unfortunate Sir Charles M'Carthy, who was for some time a prisoner in the enemy's camp, stated, on his return, that he was astonished at the discipline of the Ashantee armj', and at the regularity with which the officers and soldiers performed then respective duties. The Ashantee monarchy is hereditary ; but the order of succession is peculiar. The crown does not descend from father to son, but passes from brother to brother. This arrangement most pro bably originated in the necessities of a military government, which would not abow the sceptre to be placed in tbe hands of infancy ; an event that doubtless would have been of frequent occur rence, had the lineal order been preserved amongst a people whose principal occupation is war. A female cannot ascend the throne ; but if, when the last of the line of brothers dies, his sister has a son, the crown descends to him. The"], [138, "110 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. heir-apparent, it woidd appear, is generally marked out during the life-time of the reigning sovereign. When Bowdich was at Coomassie, Ockoto, the brother of the king, who actuaby succeeded him at his death, was then acknow ledged as his heir; and Quako Kujoh, son of the sister of the present king, is at this time recog nised as the future sovereign of Ashantee. The native term used as the title of the hen-apparent, and indeed of all the princes of the blood, is Ossu. The government of Fantee appears to have been formed, at the commencement of its independence, on a different model from that of Ashantee. According to Meredith, when the Fantees resisted the authority, and fled out of the dominions, of Ashantee, they proceeded to elect an individual to act as governor among them. But as they were afraid, that, for a reward, or on a promise of favour, he might be induced to betray them to their old masters, they resolved to prove his devotedness to then interests by a severe test, and required from the successful candidate for the government, that he should lose his left hand. While he hesitated to give this proof of his attach ment to their cause, a general murmur arose among the people ; and his cane-bearer, stepping forward, declared that he was willing to sacri-"], [139, "111 CHAPTER IV. sice a hand for their good, although his master was not. His offer was immediately accepted, and, his left hand having been taken off, he was con stituted the Braffo, that is, captain or leader of the people; and his family was provided for by the State. At length bis descendants and family-con nexions formed themselves into a separate State or community ; and the district in which they resided acquired, in consequence, the name of the Braffo country, of which Abrah was the capital, and became the source of ab the laws and customs of the Fantee country. The power of the Braffo does not appear to have been absolute in the first instance. Bosnian, who wrote at the beginning of the last century, repre sents tne Braffo, although the chief governor, and having greater power than any other person in the whole land, as somewhat closely restrained by the old men, who were a sort of national counseUors, \" not unbke,\" he remarks, \" some European Par liaments ; acting perfectly according to their own inclinations, without consulting the Braffo.\" He further states, that \" every part of Fantee had also its own particular chief, who would sometimes scarcely acknowledge himself subject to the Braffo, who had only the ineffectual name of the supreme power.\" In process of time the Braffoes extended their power and authority, until they became so ob-"], [140, "112 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. noxious to the people, that when Add, who had reigned very tyrannicaby, died, his family was rejected, and Adoku was caUed to the stool, which he occupied, with more bmited authority, during the Ashantee invasions. He was assisted in the administration of pubbe affairs by twelve officers, whose dignity was hereditary in as many families. These state-officers, when they went abroad, lived at the pubbe expense, and took for themselves whatever they pleased of the property of others. With regard to the Fantees it may, however, be generaby remarked, that, although they have long been the most powerful people upon the coast, they were never so united as to form one compact pobtical body. They have been classed in distinct communities, with their respective chiefs, and held together only by general ties, under a nominal head. At present there are two principal Fantee chiefs^dignified with the name of king; Agri, who resides at Cape-Coast town, and Otii, whose authority is exercised in the Braffo country. There are several inferior chiefs, each of whom exerts a rubng influence in his own bmited dis trict. In all the towns there are native magis trates, called pynims, to whom, under the chiefs, is committed the administration of justice. The principal chiefs, on public occasions, make a some what imposing appearance. Otu, for instance, at such times, is dressed in silk, with gold orna-"], [141, "113 CHAPTER IV- ments, and seated on a stool with cushion and bebs. Behind him an attendant stands, with a large umbreba ; and on each hand are placed officers with swords under their arms, the gold handles of which project in front ; and others, with gold and silver-headed canes. In the other countries on the coast, the forms of government vary. Westward of Fantee, in Apobonia, the government is an absolute monarchy ; and in the Ahanta country, it is a kind of aristocracy. At Accra, (Akrah,) east ward, the aristocracy is checked by a democratic influence."], [142, "CHAPTER V. DOMESTIC SLAVERY, STATE OF THE FEMALE SEX, POPULATION, AND AGRICULTURE.

The absence of enlightened freedom is one of the most striking characteristics of African society. In the nations of Western and Central Africa, the few are despots, and the great mass of the people slaves. Although the foUowers of \" the Prophet\" are forbidden by their religion to enthral those who are their brethren in the same faith, yet, in the principal Mahommedan States, the num-"], [143, "115 CHAPTER V. ber of Pagan Negroes held in a state of slavery is far greater than that of the free population. Clapperton found that in Kano, one of the prin cipal towns in Hausa, under the dominion of the sultan of the Felatahs, the proportion of slaves to freemen was as thirty to one ; and he also incidentaby mentions a village in the immediate vicinity of Sackatoo (Sakatii) where only one in seventy was free. In the Pagan States, however, slavery prevails still more extensively. Every caboceer or noble of Ashantee (As-hanti) is the possessor of thou sands of slaves, and the inferior chieftains and captains own a lesser number. The bves and services of the slaves are at the disposal of their masters. A person may take away the life of his own slave with impunity ; and if he kill the slave of another, he can only be required to pay the market-value of his victim. The slaves are employed in cultivating the plantations of then masters, or in trading for them ; and have such an abowance for their support, as their owners may deem sufficient. A caboceer, or principal chief, derives an indi rect benefit from the slaves of his captains. Every captain or subordinate chief gives up, in the form of a tax, a certain portion of his income to his superior ; and he, again, pays a tax to the king. While Mr. Freeman was detained at Fdmunah,"], [144, "116 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. he frequently saw the captains of Korinchi bring their respective quotas, amounting from one toku, value five-pence, to four tokus; but by what rule those payments were regulated, he did not ascertain. The superior chief, however, on some occasions, at least, acts as though all the property of his captains was his. When Mr. Freeman first arrived at Fdmunah, Korinchi sent him and his attendants to the house of one of his captains, who hospitably entertained them during the whole of their stay in that place ; but when Mr. Freeman was about to make a suitable acknowledgment to his attentive host, he was given to understand that Korinchi was the person to whom he ought to express his gratitude, as the captain was only Korinchi's slave. A similar fact is mentioned by Clapperton. On one occasion he asked the king of Yarriba to furnish him with some food in return for certain presents ; when the king told him to go to the caboceers, and they would provide him with suppbes. To this, however, Clapperton objected, saying, he had not visited Katunga in tbe character of a beggar ; but he was corrected by the king, who informed him that the caboceers were ab his own slaves, and that whatever they possessed was bis property. Humibating as is that state of dependence in which the life and services of an 'individual are at the absolute disposal of another, the treatment of"], [145, "117 CHAPTER V. slaves in Africa is not uniformly harsh and severe. In Ashantee, (As-hanti,) a slave sometimes suc ceeds to the stool and property of his deceased master ; which custom may serve to illustrate the circumstances of Abraham previous to the birth of his son Isaac. \" Behold,\" says the patriarch, \" to me thou hast given no seed ; and lo, one born in my house is mine heir.\" * Was not this presumptive heir of Abraham the son of one of his own domestics, and may it not be concluded that the As-hantee custom has thus descended from remote antiquity? In many instances, slaves rise to power and office. The case of Barka Gana, mentioned by Denham, affords an apt illustration. This indivi dual was the general of the sheikh of Bornou, and governor of six large districts. He had a considerable number of slaves of his own, and enjoyed, in a high degree, the favour of his master. This, however, he forfeited, by an act of disrespect. The sheikh, having inadvert ently presented liim with a horse which he had promised to some one else, sent for the animal back, which so offended Barka Gana, that he returned ab the horses previously given to him by the sheikh ; declaring, that in future, he would either walk, or ride his own horses. On receiving * Genesis xv. 3."], [146, "118 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. this message, the sheikh immediately summoned him to appear, and, reminding him that he was only a slave, caused him to be stripped in his pre sence, and ordered that he should be immediately sold to the Tibbu merchants. That this order was not ultimately carried into effect, was solely owing to the returning kindness of the sheikh. Sometimes slaves acquire such power as to become tbe objects of the sovereign's jealousy. The king of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) in conversing with Mr. Hutchinson, advocated the slave-trade, for the reason, that the slave-population in the country was too numerous for the pubbe safety ; and to show that his apprehensions were not groundless, he instanced the conduct of a number of slaves who rose against him in the Buntuku war, and joined the standard of his enemies. He said, he had at that time one slave who had a thousand fobowers at arms, and expressed his fears that he might disturb tbe pubbe peace bke Kujoh Kuma, who was a slave of his when he revolted, and who, independent of run-aways, had at his command a force of ten thousand men. When Clapperton was passing through Yarriba, he found that there had been a servile war in that country. The Hausa slaves, encouraged by the Felatah invaders, had risen against and murdered their masters; and, after a severe struggle, had secured their independence."], [147, "119 CHAPTER V. A careful investigation of the state of African society wdl serve to show, that the foreign slave trade is valued by the native princes, not only on account of its pecuniary advantages, but also as an outlet for what they deem a redundant slave population. In many eases the slave-trade is the immediate cause of the internal wars by which Africa is ravaged ; and the horrors of such wars as are promoted by the slave-dealer for the purpose of supplying the foreign market with human flesh and sinews, are affectingly ibus trated in the autobiography of a captured Negro from the neighbouring Slave-Coast, which will be inserted in the Appendix.* But were the slave trade to be immediately extinguished, peace would not, as a necessary consequence, be restored to Africa. There are other causes of war besides that inhuman traffic. On examining the historic sketch which has been given of the wars of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) it will be seen that the obtaining of slaves was not their primary object : they were undertaken in resistance to aggression, to revenge some insult, or in maintenance of abeged rights. The suppression of the foreign slave-trade, however desirable, would not, there fore, of itself, remove such causes of internal com motions. Unless remedial measures be intro- * See Appendix I."], [148, "120 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. duced into Africa herself, the endless disputes which take place among her savage or semi barbarous tribes wib still prove the occasion of frequent wars; and those wars will probably become more sanguinary in their results, should not the slave-trade enable the conquerors to avoid the apprehended danger of placing their prisoners among their own people. Ten thousand of the prisoners taken in the Gaman or Buntuku war were put to death by the Ashantees in cold blood, in a way most revolting to humanity ; and the motives which dictated this horrible massacre were thus explained to Dupuis by the king himself: \u2014 \" When I fought Gaman, I did not make war for slaves, but because Dinkara (the king) sent me an arrogant message, and kiUed my people, and refused to pay me gold, as his father did. Then my fetish made me strong, bke my ancestors; and I kibed' Dinkara, and took his gold, and brought more than twenty thousand slaves to Coomassie. Some of these people being bad men, I washed my stool** in their blood for the fetish. But then some, were good people, and these I sold or gave to/afe captains: many, more over, died, because this cjpuntry does not grow too much corn, like Safem; and what can I do? Unless I kib or seU them, they wib grow strong, and kill my people.\" Under the influence of similar views, when Mr."], [149, "121 CHAPTER V. Norris refused to purchase from the king of Dahomy, the prisoners whom he had taken in a recent war, and recommended that he should make them boilers of salt, as they came from a country winch suppbed them with that article, or that he should employ them in some other occupation which he might deem preferable ; the king utterly refused to bsten to any such proposal. He said it would not be safe to keep people in his country who might utter seditious language, and set a bad example ; for that his was a peculiar government, and those strangers might prejudice his own people against it, and infect them with sentiments incompatible with its principles and requirements. For these reasons, the king declared he should put the prisoners to death. Such was the con clusion of another despot, who dreaded an increase of the slave-population of his own country, and had not an opportunity to rebeve himself, in another way, of the captives whom he had taken in war. And unless, during the process by which the foreign slave-trade shab be extinguished, suitable \u25a0 means be simultaneously used to en bghten the pubbe mind of Africa, and to con struct society there upon a new principle, not only wib wars continue to prevail, but those wars will either prove more bloody in the field, or wib serve to add new horrors to the national superstitions, by furnishing a greater number of human sacri- G"], [150, "122 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. fices for the annual customs and other festival occasions; for it is a settled principle of the popular superstition, as explained by the king of Ashantee, in vindication of his inhuman butcheries, that \" the fetish makes war for strong men every where, because then they can pay plenty of gold, and proper sacrifice.\" Polygamy is another of the distinguishing features of society in Africa. The kings and prin cipal persons have usuaby a great number of wives. It is stated that the law allows the king of Ashan tee (As-hanti) to possess three thousand three hundred and thirty-three ; but in what consists the charm of this mystic number, which is carefully kept up, does not appear. The king has seldom a greater number than six with him in the palace at the same time ; the rest bve at the country residence of the king, and in the capital, where two streets are devoted to their use. No persons are permitted to approach them but their own female relatives, or the king's messengers ; and these only communicate with them at the en trances, which are closed at each end with bamboo doors, where a guard is placed. When they go abroad, which is not often the case, they are attended by a great number of bttle boys with whips of elephants' hide, with which they lash severely ab who do not immediately turn aside"], [151, "123 CHAPTER V. into another path, or throw themselves into the bush with their hands before their eyes. Some times the offenders are also visited with a fine. It is stated, that their appearance in the more public parts of the city occasions great confusion. Caboceers and captains, as web as slaves and chil dren, are seen tumbling one over another, to avoid their approach. When the king of Ashantee signed Bowdich' s treaty, three hundred of his wives, however, were present as witnesses of the transaction; and at a pubbe entertainment given by the king of Dahomy, Mr. Norris saw seven hundred and thirty of the wives of that monarch, who marched in file, bearing bquors and provisions upon their heads ; and these were fobowed by many hundreds more, classed in troops of seventy each, who walked in greater state. In Yarriba, even a cabo ceer has been known to possess two thousand wives ; while the king of that country told Clap perton that he did not know how many wives and children he had ; but he was sure that his wives alone, hand to hand, would reach from Katunga, the capital, to Jannah, \u2014 a distance, as appears from the maps, of considerably more than one hundred miles ! On one occasion, he actuaby visited the traveber in company with five hun dred wives. This latter sovereign makes the services of his g 2"], [152, "124 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. wives subservient to his pecuniary interests; for\" Clapperton remarks that, in their journey from Badagry to Katunga, they found in every place some of his wives trading for him, and, bke other women of the common class, carrying large loads upon then* heads from town to town. The wives of the king of Ashantee, it appears, are not thus degraded ; but bve in a state more in accordance with their dignity. Bowdich says that the three hundred whom he saw at the signing of the treaty, were arrayed in all the magnificence which a pro fusion of gold and silk could furnish. According to Dupuis, however, their influence is not great. Their mediation is considered unavailing in state affairs, and they are not permitted, nor do they expect, to receive presents from foreign ambassa dors. Whereas in Barbary, as in the East, it is of the first importance to secure female mediation ; for the determination of the sultan is generaby formed under the influence of the harem or seragbo. The number of wives which caboceers and other persons possess depends partly on their rank, and partly on their abdity to purchase them ; for the practice which prevailed in the remote ages of patriarchal antiquity, is perpetuated among the \u2022descendants of Ham. With them also, it is the rule that the parent receives a sum for his daugh ter, instead of giving a fortune with her, as is"], [153, "125 CHAPTER V. the practice in European countries ; and it con sequently fobows, that a large famby of daughters is a source of wealth to an African father. Nor has the husband cause to complain, that he is required to pay for every wife; for in Fantee, (Fanti,) and the countries near the coast, if a man can only obtain six or ten wives, the fruits of theii* labour are sufficient to enable him to lead a life of indolence. In the affair of courtship the wishes of the female are but bttle consulted ; the business being chiefly settled between the suitor and her parents. No Ashantee, however, compels his daughter to become the wife of one whom she dislikes : but if she refuse to receive as her husband one of whom her father approves, he instantly withdraws from her his support and protection, and prohibits her mother also from affording her any aid or coun tenance whatever. It is not unfrequently the case that infants are married to each other, to promote the connexion of families; and infants are also frequently wedded to adults, and even to elderly men. In such cases, the husband sends a present to the mother, who brings up the chbd for him, until she is old enough to be removed to his own house. The Ashantee caboceers speak of this as a good plan for a man who wishes to get gold; for the most innocent freedom, when the girl becomes ten or eleven years old,"], [154, "126 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. proves the occasion of a serious palaver with the husband; and as these marriages are not gene rally known, it happens that such palavers fre quently occur, and a person has to make compen sation for taking bberty with a wife when he supposed that he was only playing with a child. It is, moreover, a custom in Ashantee, (As-hanti,) to contract for a child before it is born. When a man takes a fancy to the wife of a caboceer in a state of pregnancy, be consaws the infant in the womb, by the payment of a sum, varying from two to ten ounces of gold; and should the clnld prove to be a girl, she is brought up for him as his wife. The domestic arrangements, in places where polygamy prevails, are formed on a different prin ciple from that which regulates an Engbsh domi cde. In Ashantee, (As-hanti,) Fantee, (Fanti,) and the neighbouring countries, the husband bves separate from his wives, who dweb in houses or sheds built contiguous to each other, in the form of a square ; and in some cases they continue with their mothers. They cook and carry food to their husband, but are not abowed to partake of a meal in his presence. Sometimes his children eat with him, but more frequently he eats alone. On one occasion, when Mr. Hutchinson paid a visit to the croom of Apdko, one of the greatest men in Ashantee, he had the opportunity of witness-"], [155, "CHAPTER V. 127 ing a domestic scene. About the middle of the day, a large pot of yams, and another of boded fish, were placed in a side room, whither Apdko repaired and dined; after which he divided the remaining yams and fish into a given number of portions, when the door opened, and about twenty of his sons and daughters received then respective shares in calabashes with which they came fur nished. In the after-part of the day, four of his wives arrived from Coomassie, a distance of about three miles, with some prepared food; but as he was disposed to sleep, he sent them word that they were not to enter the room, but leave the meat, and go back again to town. The chbdren are left chiefly to the care of their mothers, and grow up without correction, until at length, when the perverseness of a boy can no longer be endured, the Ashantee father punishes him by cutting off an ear. Some of the Ashantees, however, appeared to admit the force of Mr. Freeman's arguments in favour of early and moderate correction. Unfaithfulness on the part of the wife is treated with severity. Death is sometimes the penalty which both the guflty parties have to pay; but more frequently the injured husband is satisfied with a fine from the parents of bis offending wife, and another from her paramour. Sometimes he cuts off her nose, if her famby are too powerful"], [156, "128 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. to be provoked with safety by putting her to death* It is not uncommon, however, that the wives and daughters of even men in power are employed by their husbands and fathers to abure the other sex into crime, in order to involve their victims in a palaver, which has ended in their being sold into slavery, when they have not been rich enough to pay the required fine. In Ashantee, (As-hanti,) a peculiar provision is made with reference to the female sex. One of the king's sisters is constituted the governess of the empire, or queen over the females. When this personage, on a certain occasion, honoured Dupuis with a cab, she was accompanied by about one hundred and fifty women and girls, many of whom were described as the wives and daughters of men of high rank. Ab the females in the em pire are said to be placed under her direction and control ; but whatever may be the nature and object of the training to which she subjects them, it is certain that it is not intended to make the wife the rational companion and confidential friend of her husband; for if an Ashantee wife is detected in hstening to a private conversa tion of her husband, her curiosity is sure to cost her an ear ; and if she betrays a secret with which she has by any means become acquainted, her incensed husband punishes her by cutting off her upper lip. The sight of women who"], [157, "129 CHAPTER V. have suffered such inflictions is as common at this day in Coomassie as it was in the time of Bowdich. With regard to the employment of the female sex, it may be remarked, that the weightiest duties generaby devolve upon the wife, who is to be found \" grinding at the mill,\" * transact- ing business in tbe market, or cultivating the plantation. The females of the higher classes in Ashantee (As-hanti) may be exempt from such drudgery; but the condition of Fantee (Fanti) wives, in general, is similar to that in which Clap perton found the wives of the king of Yarriba. In countries where polygamy prevails, it might be presumed, that either there is a great disparity between the sexes, or that ab do not marry. Ac- cording to Bosnian, the number of women among the natives on the coast, in his day, was much greater than that of the men ; but it is supposed that the proportion of women to men in Ashantee, is not two to one; and it is the fact, that the majority of the males bve without wives. Some- times a caboceer will give his daughter to a con- fidential slave; but cebbacy is the condition of far the greater proportion of the slave population, which principally constitutes the mibtary force of Ashantee. From this unequal state of things, the * Matthew xxiv. 41. G 5"], [158, "130 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. grossest irregularities naturaby fobow. In despite of the penalties with which incontinence is visited, the violation of the marriage-contract is notori ously common; and prostitution is openly coun tenanced. In some instances, females are provided by the State, and are set apartf to their office by pubbe formalities and rebgious ceremonies. As many as two hundred and fifty females of this description have been seen together on state-occa sions at the court of Dahomy. But scarcely any single circumstance tends to show so clearly the demorabzation of Negro society, as the fact that wealthy females on their death-bed regard it as one of tbe most meritorious acts which they can perform, to bequeath to the pubbe a few female slaves. What must be the moral condition of a people, where the State lends its authority to legalize crime, and the sanctions of rebgion are employed to invest vice with the attributes of virtue ! The large towns of Ashantee (As-hanti) contain a considerable population. The inhabitants of the capital have been variously estimated. This has partly resulted from the circumstance, that the towns of this part of Africa are surrounded by a number of plantations belonging to the inha bitants ; and the natives always include the slaves on those plantations in their estimates of"], [159, "131 CHAPTER V. the population of the towns to which they are attached. Bowdich fixed the resident population of Coomassie (Kumasi) at fifteen thousand; but says, the Ashantees persisted bi asserting that, when it was collected, it was upwards of one hundred thousand ; and he himseff admits, that, including the slaves in the suburban plantations, the population is probably much greater than that of Sego, which was estimated by Park at thirty thousand. Dupuis does not expressly specify the population of the capital ; but he compares it with other towns in reference to their size ; as, for instance, he states that Juabin \" is to be reckoned about one-third the size of Coomassie, (Kumasi,) and its popu lation is estimated at seventy thousand souls;\" and that Salgha, the great emporium of Inta or Ghunja, \"is reported to be twice the size of Coomassie, and its population (of whom one sixth part are Moslems) to be about four hundred thousand.\" H the writer is to be understood as intimatiig that the population of these towns is proportionate to the number of houses which they contain, and the ground they respectively cover, it fobows, that Coomassie, according to his calcu lation, contains two hundred thousand, or two hundred and ten thousand inhabitants. This estimate is, doubtless, too high; but Mr. Free man is of opinion that Bowdich's is too low;"], [160, "132 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. and Mr. M'Queen, in his recent work, has judiciously avoided both extremes, and, following the Ashantee census, has fixed the population of Coomassie at one hundred thousand souls. The total number of considerable towns in Ashantee (As-hanti) is unknown to Europeans. The capital is \" environed by numerous large and smab towns;\" and it has been ascertained that many others are situated within the track of the great roads or pathways, eight of which, named after the kings in whose reigns they were formed, are cut through the immense forest in which Coomassie is embosomed, and extend from the capital to the most distant parts of the empire ; these again being intersected by numerous cross paths in various parts of the provinces. Dupuis gives the population of several towns which he saw on the pathway leading from Coomassie (Kumasi) to Cape-Coast Castle ; among which may be instanced Akrofrum, with eighteen thou sand inhabitants ; Dumpasi, with fifteen thou sand ; Majuri, with ten thousand ; Amoafo, with seven thousand; Asiminia, with seven or eight thousand-; Abointem, with three thousand; and Sarasu, with eight thousand. Dwabin, or Juabin, already referred to as being one-third the size of Coomassie, (Kumasi,) is situated about sixteen miles from the capital, on another pathway, in a south-easterly direction. The same writer also"], [161, "133 CHAPTER V. gives the names of sixteen principal towns, acces sible by the pathway leading from the capital to the northern boundaries of the empire; of four teen others, on the pathway to Salgha; and of several others, in various directions. Yahndi, the capital of Dagumba, is represented as much larger than Salgha; which town is said to be twice tbe size of Coomassie. The two pathways leading to Dagumba and to Salgha are cabed the \"old roads,\" from their antiquity and pre eminence. Taking Bowdich's estimate of one milhon as the amount of the population of Ashantee Proper, Murray calculates that the empire of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) including all its subjects and vassals, must contain more than four millions of people.* To those who look fuby and fairly at the subject, this calculation probably will not appear extra vagant. A person, travelling direct from the coast to Coomassie, without diverging on either hand into the forest, through which the main track bes, is in danger of underrating the popu lation. Mr. Freeman remarks, that, when he first went to Fdmunah, he had not the sbghtest idea of the extent to which the neighbourhood was inhabited; and was afterwards surprised, in his perambulations around the town, to find many * Encyc. of Geography."], [162, "134 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. crooms or vibages, containing a considerable popu lation, situated in places where he bad supposed there was nothing but a dense forest. The most populous provinces, however, if the testimony of the natives is to be depended upon, lie northward of Coomassie, where the country is much more open than in the vicinity of the capital and towards the south; and the district around the large trading town of Salgha is reported to be thickly inhabited. The general conclusion adopted by Mr. M 'Queen is, that, with the exception of a small portion of the sea-coast, this part of Africa is ex ceedingly populous ; that it \" swarms with popu lation;\" which conclusion is supported by a consi deration of the scale on which the wars of the Ash antees and their neighbours bave been conducted. In the war between Ashantee (As-hanti) and Denkera, one hundred thousand men perished in a single engagement ; and in the battle in which Abu Bekr was made captive, the king of Ashan tee destroyed upon the field, or made prisoners, one hundred thousand of his enemies. Admit ting that ab the males are trained to arms, yet it is impossible to conclude otherwise than that nations which can conduct war on so large a scale, and sacrifice such multitudes in a single conflict, must undoubtedly have great resources. The countries of Asin and Fantee, (Fanti,)"], [163, "135 CHAPTER V. supposed to have contained at one period between three and four millions of inhabitants, had suffered so greatly from the wars which have been partly described, that their population, inclusive of the large towns of Fantee, did not, at the time when Bowdich and Dupuis went to Coo massie, amount to more than three or four hundred thousand. Since the peace, however, the population of Fantee has rapidly increased; in evidence of which Mr. Freeman states, that, during the three years immediately preceding his visit to England last year, not more than ten of the native converts attached to the Wesleyan Mis sion had died, but that two hundred and fifty of then chddren had been admitted into the Chris tian church by baptism. It is not perhaps too much to assume, that Mr. Freeman, owing to the system of regular itinerancy on which he acts in prosecuting his Missionary labours, is more inti mately acquainted with Fantee than any other European ; and it is his opinion, that the tract of country included within the curvature of the river Prah, the borders of Akim and Aquapim, and the sea, has, at the present time, a population of eight hundred thousand or a milhon of souls. Immense forests (which, from the gigantic size of many of the trees, the flowering shrubs and cbmbers with which they are intermingled, and"], [164, "136 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. the exquisite parasitical plants with which they are covered, exhibit a combination of magnificence and beauty equaby novel and surprising to an European eye) luxuriate in Ashantee (As-hanti) from about the seventh degree of north latitude down to the neighbourhood of the coast. The rich and fertde sod produces cotton, indigo, coffee, rice, sugar-cane, maize or Indian corn, yams, plantains, bananas, and most kinds of tropical fruit. Pine-apples are so plentiful, that they may be bought on the coast for a penny each. A remarkable fruit grows spontaneously inland, which has obtained the appehation of \" the miraculous berry.\" It leaves such an effect upon the palate, for an hour or two after it is eaten, that the most acid bme tastes bke a luscious orange, and vinegar may be mistaken for sweet wine. Cabbages, peas, turnips, carrots, cucumbers, melons, various salads, and other esculents, can be produced in any quantity, at a moderate distance from the coast. The native mode of agriculture is very imper fect. When a suitable spot has been selected for cultivation, the slaves are employed to clear away the thicket, and to lop or cut down the large trees, excepting those which are regarded with super stitious veneration, and others of a useful kind, as the high and low pabn, bamboo, tamarind,, papa, cocoa, and some which bear valuable nuts. The"], [165, "137 CHAPTER V. trees, branches, and brushwood, which have thus undergone the operation of the bib-hook, are spread upon the surface until dried by the heat of the sun, when the whole is burned, and the ashes are scattered over the field as manure. Holes are then made in the ground, with a smab hoe, at regular distances ; in which the grain is deposited, and left to germinate without much further care or attention. As the traveber from the coast advances into Ashantee, (As-hanti,) the plantations become more flourishing and extensive ; and on ap- proaching the capital, they are seen placed with much regularity in triangular beds, each sur- rounded by a smab drain, and carefuhy cleared from weeds. Leaving Coomassie (Kumasi) again for Salgha, the road bes through a beautiful country, and the crooms through which it passes are all environed by extensive plantations. Some of the districts of Ashantee are more open and cultivated than others. Yomoho in Akim, for instance, bas a large agricultural popu- lation, and suppbes the markets of Dwabin, or Juabin, Bequa, Sarasu, Dumpasi, and other towns, with corn and yams. Quahu is also repre- sented as a very fruitful province ; in many parts of which the land is clear and open, even down to the Volta, where there is a valuable fishery, that gives employment to many thousands of the"], [166, "138 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. natives. The northern provinces, generaUy, are much more open than those in the south. The palm-tree is in some places cultivated by the natives, for the sake of the wine which it yields, and also for its nuts, from which the od is expressed. When a tree is seven years old, it is then mature enough to produce wine. There are two methods for obtaining it. Sometimes the tree is left standing, and the branches are cut off nearly to the bole. An orifice is then made iu the bole, near the top, from which the bquor begins to ooze out. But it is preferred to cut the tree down ; and, after lopping off the branches, to burn a few dry leaves under it before it is tapped. The juice continues to flow for a fortnight, at the rate of a gabon in twenty-four hours. The wine drawn in the morning is fresh for about four hours. By the middle of the day it begins to ferment, and is then intoxicating. After the fermentation is over, (say, on the fobowing morn ing,) it is good vinegar. The wine of some of the trees is too sweet for the taste of the men, and is chiefly drunk by females. Some attempts to introduce an improved me thod of cultivation into this part of Africa, deserve especial notice. In the year 1792 the Danish government, having arranged for the final rebn quishment of its share in the slave-trade in ten years from that time, resolved, as a preparatory"], [167, "139 CHAPTER V. measure, to form an agricultural settlement in the vicinity of their forts, near tbe river Volta. Dr. Isert, having travebed in that part of Africa, and cobected much valuable information, was ap pointed by the government to proceed thither again, and select a suitable locabty. In the first instance, he fixed upon a large and beautiful island in the Volta; but the natives, under the influence of the white slave-dealers, opposing his design, he finally established a settlement among the mountains of Aquapim, fifty miles from Accra, (Akrah,) the same distance from the Volta, and about thirty mbes from the Pom, a smab stream, navigable by boats. The native caboceer, or chief, granted as much land as was necessary for the purpose, at a monthly rate of eight rix-doUars, about sixteen shillings sterling. At this spot a number of the Negroes, who were first enfran chised by the Danish government, were cobected ; and some European agriculturists were sent, who introduced the use of the plough. The early efforts of the settlers were attended by an encou raging measure of success ; especiaby in the culti vation of Guinea corn, millet, and cotton ; and the Danish government expressed its sense of the services of Dr, Isert, by raising him to the rank of captain. The phdanthropic exertions of that gentleman, however, shortly terminated by his death; and"], [168, "140 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Lieutenant-Colonel Roer, who had paid much attention to botany, and had, moreover, great experience in West-Indian cultivation, was ap pointed to take the management of the new settlement. He was accompanied by his sister, who laudably exerted herseb in instructing the Negro women in spinning cotton, and other domestic occupations. The state of the settle ment in the year 1795, about three years after its formation, is thus described in a letter from Mr. Moe, pubbshed by Wadstrom, in the appendix to bis work: \u2014 \" I have the satisfaction of acquainting you, that I have been in Aquapim, and have seen the late Captain Isert's colonial establishment at that place. It is situated on a high and mountainous tract of land j but so distant from navigation, that it appears to me very inconvenient for commerce. But, for the rest, I have good reason to think that the sob, air, and water are all very good. There are but few Europeans ; but they were in the best state of health during my stay among them. Mr. Flint, who, tib the arrival of Lieutenant- Colonel Roer, takes care of this infant colony, has estabbshed another similar one at the foot of the mountains, nearer to Accra ; and I saw growing, at both places, a considerable quantity of cotton trees and maize, ab of which flourished and throve very web. The dry and wet seasons are not so"], [169, "141 CHAPTER V. distinct at Aquapim as near the coast; for rains fab there in ab the other months of the year, as web as in the rainy season. \" I observed that, near the Danish forts at Rio Volta, Printzenstein, and Quitta, the commanders of those places and a certain merchant have begun to plant cotton, sugar-canes, and different kinds of garden-stuffs, such as greens and sweet peas. \" In the neighbourhood of Christiansburg, at Accra, an old respectable Negro, a native of Dunko, at a considerable distance up in the inte rior part, has estabbshed himself on a sobtary spot, and has planted large fields with cotton, maize, and various kinds of provisions and garden-stuffs. By his intebigent and laborious cultivation he has distinguished himself so much, that he is now come into great repute. He raises such quantities of provisions, that he suppbes not only Chris tiansburg, but also most of the neighbouring Negro vibages.\" The Danish government, in further prosecution of its design, in the year 1798, sent out Mr. P. Thonning, to investigate the capabilities of tbe country, and make botanical researches ; and shortly after Mr. H. Schmidt was sent on the same service. The latter gentleman did not long survive ; but Mr. Thonning made a survey of the country from Accra to the Volta, and returned to"], [170, "142 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Europe with forty-two new genera, and two hun dred and four species, of plants. Ab who have visited Aquapim represent it as web adapted for agriculture. Mr. Schionning, the governor of Christiansburg Castle, at Danish Accra, says, \" As to beauty of prospect, pleasing variety, and local advantages, I never saw any thing equal ; nor can I compare any part of the world where I have been to it ; in short, you may compare it to what poets describe when they depict nature in ab her elegance.\" He further expresses the opinion, that wheat would grow well in Aquapim ; and remarks, that ab European garden-productions thrive as web there as in Europe. The sugar-cane grows to an immense size inland, out of the reach of the ants. Mr. Schionning himself had an extensive plan tation, about fifteen mbes from Accra, (Akrah,) which promised an abundant increase previous to the Ashantee war. His proceedings and pros pects are thus described by himself : \u2014 \" In October, 1808, I put some coffee-berries in the ground; and in the following June I trans planted about sixteen thousand young trees. I have every year added to this stock; and in November last (1810) I had growing thirty-six thousand five hundred healthy coffee-trees, of different ages. Last year I had a nice crop ; and I am sure that I should have had from sixteen to"], [171, "143 CHAPTER V. twenty thousand pounds' weight of coffee this year, had not the Ashantee war put a stop to my exer tions. I calculate upon a pound and a half annu ally, (from each tree,) when the trees are four years old. To keep my plantation in good order, one person is necessary to one thousand trees. On high land the coffee-tree thrives much better than on level or marshy ground. High-land coffee is far superior in flavour, but not so advan tageous as the low-land coffee, which, being much larger, is, of course, much heavier.\" The writer is not possessed of information as to the present state and prospects of these establish ments; but the success attending the earber efforts of the Danish government is sufficient to show what might be accompbshed by the appbca tion of suitable means."], [172, "CHAPTER VI.

H"], [174, "146 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. The Ashantees and Fantees are ingenious art ists in the precious metal which their country produces. Among the specimens of native manu facture which the writer has had the opportunity of examining, were chains and rings, executed in a very creditable manner. The writer has been told, by an artist in London, that a valuable gold-chain of Engbsh manufacture, which had been repaired by a native of the Gold Coast, was put into his hands by the owner, and that he was not able, after a careful examination, to point out the new links which had been added. Some of the rings are of sobd gold, ornamented with various devices ; others are formed of a hoop, entwined with net-work ; and others, again, are composed entirely of gold net-work, which enlarge or contract, according to the size of the finger. The Ashantee artists are expert in moulding gold into the form of birds, fishes, and various animals. Iron is also manufactured to a considerable extent; and some of the swords made by the Ashantees are said to show very fine workman ship. The native carpenters' work is not despicable. The writer has before him a stool, made of a white, soft wood, neatly carved ; and a low chair, brought by Mr. Freeman from the interior, which displays considerable taste : it is also made of"], [175, "147 CHAPTER VI. white wood, and carved, and is studded ab over with brass nabs : the bottom is of strong leather. The chair shuts up like a camp-stool, and has, on the whole, a somewhat elegant appearance. The tanning of leather is also understood. The writer has in his possession a large, round cushion, made of red-coloured leather, ingeniously orna mented with various devices cut in the substance with a knife. The cushion is stuffed with the cotton produced by the suk-cotton tree. Various specimens of pipe-heads, bought by Mr. Freeman in the market of Coomassie, (Kumasi,) similar to those sent by Bowdich, with one of the above-mentioned cushions, to the British Museum, support the favourable opinion which that traveber has given of Ashantee pottery. The art of weaving has made considerable pro- gress among the Ashantees. The principle of their looms is the same as that of the hand-loom of the Engbsh; but the web which they manu- facture never exceeds four inches in breadth. They purchase the richest silks, in order to un- ravel and interweave them with their own thread ; and their best cloths are extobed for their fine- ness, variety, brilbance, and size. The colours used by them in dyeing are, red, blue, and yebow, and a green produced by a union of the two last-mentioned colours. h 2"], [176, "148 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. In Ashantee, (As-hanti,) the several arts and manufactures are, in some cases, carried on in the same town. Dumpasi, for instance, is men tioned by Bowdich as a very industrious town, where cloth, beads, and pottery were manufac tured in ab directions ; and the blacksmiths' bebows were always at work. At other places, only one kind of manufacture is found, as at Datiasu, the inhabitants of which are exclusively employed in potteries, and at Asiminia, where almost the entire population is engaged in weaving. The spirit of commercial enterprise does not prevail to so great an extent among the Ashantees as in some of the adjoining countries. When Dupuis endeavoured to impress the king with the importance of making his capital a depot of British manufactured goods, and of African produce, and explained to him that, were he to adopt the principle on which commerce is con ducted in Europe, where every article pays a relative custom to the officers of the state, in support of the government, he would derive a great revenue from the encouragement of trade ; the king repbed, that the people who bved nigher to the great water \u2014 the Niger \u2014 understood these things better than the Ashantees ; that they were a nation of warriors; and that, according"], [177, "CHAPTER VI. 149 to their fashion, only the king and great men \u25a0engaged in trade. The king, the caboceers, and captains, are, in fact, the only merchants; and it is principaby by trading that the great men -of Ashantee acquire their wealth. It may be remarked, in passing, that Ashantee trading furnishes a striking illustration of the web known scriptural parable of the talents.* The king wib frequently lend, for a period of two or three years, a few ounces of gold to a subor dinate captain, for the purpose of testing his qualifications ; and if, on rendering his account, it is found that he has made considerable gain by the use of the gold, he is raised by the king to a station of superior dignity and more extensive authority. Dupuis was present on one occasion when the unfaithfulness of a captain, who was thus on probation, was brought to bght ; on which the king indignantly ordered the loan of gold to be returned. But although the commerce of Ashantee (As hanti) is confined to the king and great men, an -extensive trading intercourse is kept up with the countries in the interior, as web as with the towns upon the coast. Upwards of half a cen tury ago, Mr. Lucas learned from the sherif at Tripob, that there was a commercial commu- * Luke xix. 13."], [178, "150 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. nication between that place and Ashantee; and the sherif, with the utmost cheerfulness and confidence of safety, offered to conduct him by the way of Fezzan and Kashna, across the Niger, to the latter country. He appeared quite fami liar with the neighbourhood of that river, and mentioned a fact which he could scarcely have known but from personal observation; namely, that fire-arms are not found in any of the countries south of the Niger, (which he professed to have visited,) because the kings nearer to the coast would not ahow the populous inland States to obtain possession of those powerful instruments of war. It has undoubtedly ever beeu the pobcy of the kings of Ashantee to prevent communication between the Gold Coast and the interior. Mr. Swanzy, in his examination before a Parbamentary Committee in 1816, stated, that he had never known any people come down to Cape Coast from Hausa, or any other country beyond Ashantee ; although traders, natives of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) very frequently came down to the forts upon the coast. Many Fantee traders, in return, go to Coomassie, (Kumasi,) but they are not allowed to advance beyond it. Dupuis found that many Moors from the interior frequently visited Coomassie; and that, occasionaby, Tunisian and Tripobtan merchants,"], [179, "151 CHAPTER VI. and natives of Cairo, of the Great Desert, and of Medina and Mecca, travebed as far as that capital. Three of the imperial sherfa,* who are regarded as descendants of the Prophet's famby, were at Coomassie during the reign of Osai Tutu Quamina ; and one of these, the sherif Ibrahim, who was there at the same time with Bowdich, returned to Cairo, with a large caravan of pflgrims under his care. That the intercourse between Ashantee (As hanti) and the countries in the interior, lying in an easterly or north-easterly direction, has been long estabbshed, may be presumed from the fact previously noticed, that the two path ways from Coomassie (Kumasi) which, on account of antiquity and pre-eminence, are cabed the old roads, are those leading to tbe Volta, opposite to Salgha, the great emporium of Ghunja, and Yahndi, the capital of Dagumba. The extent of the traffic carried on between Ashantee, and the countries in this direction, appears from the notices given by Clapperton. He states that caravans travel regularly between Bornou, Hausa, Ghunja, and Ashantee. The Bornou caravans come no further than Kuifu ; but several of the Bornou traders proceed from that place, with the Hausa caravans, to the borders of * The plural of the Arabic word sherif."], [180, "152 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Ashantee. On his journey from Badagry to Boussa, (Busah,) he met with one of those caravans at Kiama, a town through which they regularly pass, and found, accompanying it, a trader from Bornou, with whom he was ac quainted on his former visit to that country. The caravan was on its way from Ghunja and Ashantee ; and the taya, or head man, told Clapperton that they had been detained in Ghunja twelve months on account of the wars, and also, that the king of Ashantee (As-hanti) was dead. The substantial correctness of this statement \u2014 for the war between the Ashantees and Engbsh was then raging, and Osai Tutu Quamina had not long been dead \u2014 is evidence of their acquaintance with Ashantee. This caravan consisted of one thousand men and women, and beasts of burden. Clapperton thus graphicahy describes its appearance as he overtook it again on the road, after leaving Kiama. \" At ten o'clock,\" he says, \" we feb in with the Hausa caravans. They occupied a long line of march: bubocks, asses, horses, women, and men, to the amount of a thousand, ab in a line, after one another, forming a very curious sight ; a motley group, from the nearly naked girls and men carrying loads, to the ridiculously and gaudily dressed Ghunja traders riding on horseback; some of these animals being lame,"], [181, "CHAPTER VI. 153 and going with a halt, and ab in very bad con dition. The poor girls, their slaves, are compebed to travel with a heavy load on their heads ; yet are as cheerful and good-natured as if they were at home, grinding corn in their own native country.\" In this description it will be noticed, that traders from Ghunja were accompanying this caravan into the interior. Clapperton elsewhere remarks, that Ashantee merchants visit Kano, the great emporium of Hausa. On reaching Komi, or the king's ferry, represented by our traveber as the great ferry to and from Hausa, and the countries already mentioned, they met another caravan going to Ghunja; and a scene of great animation presented itself. \"The vil- lage,\" Clapperton remarks, \"is buflt on the high ground, the bank shelving gradually down to the river side, where there is a second tem- porary town composed of the huts of the mer- chants ; here and in the vibage ab was bustle and confusion. A caravan going to Ghunja was halted on the eastern bank ; on the western the kafilah from Ghunja, with koba nuts, &c. The vibage was fibed with horses and men dressed out in their gayest trappings : here merchants were offering horses for sale; there their slaves, with gay glass beads, cords of silk, unwrought sdk, and tobes, and turkadoes for sale; some h 5"], [182, "154 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. dancing and drumming; whbe others, more wicked, were drinking and rioting.\" At this ferry the Quorra, or Niger, is about a quarter of a mbe in width, and runs at the rate of two mbes an hour. On the 10th of April, the day when Clapperton went over, the water was ten or twelve feet deep in the middle. The ferry is crossed by canoes of about twenty feet long and two broad. Cattle are occasionaby made to swim over. By crossing this ferry, it may be remarked, tbe caravans from Hausa to Ghunja and Ashan tee avoid the town of Busah, and proceed to Kuifu, the great trading town of Nufi, where they meet caravans from Bornou, and halt a considerable time. It would appear that gold is not exported in any considerable quantity from Ashantee into the interior eastward, unless, however, it be carried by way of Hausa, through Fezzan, to Tripob. Clapperton expressly says, gold is neither found in Bornou, nor is brought into it ; and adds, that a smab brass basin tinned to drink out of, is there esteemed as a present for a sultan. Four or five dobars, or a Soudan tobe, wdl scarcely purchase such an article. In the Kano market, he remarks, a few sbver trinkets are to be found, but none of gold ; and in the enumeration which he gives of the mer-"], [183, "155 CHAPTER VI. chandise carried by the Hausa merchants from Ghunja and the neighbouring countries to Kuifu, the first great mart after crossing the Niger, he specifies only \"a little gold.\" The gora or koba nut is the principal export from Ashantee (As-hanti) in this direction. This was one of the articles in great request in the tune of Mr. Lucas. The sherif described the taste of this nut as that of a pleasant bitter, and spoke of it as so \" grateful to those who are accus tomed to its use, and so important a corrective to the unpalatable or unwholesome waters of Fezzan, and of the other kingdoms that border on the vast Sahara, as to be deemed of importance to the happiness of life.\" The nut, he stated, grows on a large and broad-leafed tree, that bears a pod of about eighteen inches in length, in which are enclosed from seven to nine nuts. Their colour is a yebowish green, they are about the size of a chesnut, and are also covered with a husk bke that fruit. The Fezzan merchants at that time purchased these nuts at the rate of twelve shb lings for one hundred pods. The account which the Ashantees give of the nut is, that it grows spontaneously, and does not require cultivation. Clapperton says that the Hausa merchants deal in gora nuts, the produce of Ashantee and its vicinity ; and that they are chewed by ab people of consequence, on account of their agree-"], [184, "156 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. able bitter taste, not unbke that of strong coffee, and their supposed virtue in curing a common complaint. Among the imports of Sackatoo, (Sakatu,) he enumerates gora nuts brought from the borders of Ashantee ; and in the narrative of his journey to that town from Bornou, he very frequently speaks of those nuts as the presents which he gave and received. The extent to which the trade in this article is prosecuted, may be inferred from the fact, that the large caravan which Clapperton met with at Kiama was chiefly laden with it. His own words are : \" The princi pal part of the cargo of these Hausa merchants consists in gora or koba nuts, which they receive in exchange for natron, red glass beads, and a few slaves, principally refractory ones whom they cannot manage.\" Lander also states, that, when leaving Kuifu, after the death of his master, he met with a company of merchants going to Ghunja for gora nuts. It may be remarked, in passing, that it is not very improbable that the first intebigence re specting the expedition to the Niger, after it shall have passed through the Delta of that river, may be received by way of Ashantee. From the accounts which have been pubbshed of the recent voyage of Captain Becroft up the Niger, it appears that he reached, within a very few mbes, the ferry of Komi ; and should any of"], [185, "157 CHAPTER VI. the caravans, at the time of the arrival of the expedition in that neighbourhood, be met \u2022with proceeding from Bornou and Hausa to the bor*** ders of Ashantee, a good opportunity wib be afforded of forwarding letters to Coomassie, (Kumasi,) from which place a messenger would take them to Cape-Coast Castle in a few days. The principal export of Ashantee (As-hanti) is, the precious metal from which the neighbouring coast takes its name. It is partly obtained by washing the soil. Mr. Swanzy, in his evidence, speaking of the Gold Coast, says, the gold is procured \"from every part of that country; it appears more bke an impregnation of the sod than a mine.\" . At that time, in the year 1816, he supposed, that the Gold Coast produced one hundred thousand ounces of gold annually. In like manner the sob of Ashantee yields a large amount, and one stream is mentioned, (the Barra,) on which alone eight or ten thousand slaves are employed, for two months in the year, in washing for gold. The gold is also contained in mines ; the richest of which are said to be in the province of Gaman, about nine feet from the sur face. The gold from these pits is of a very deep colour, mixed with red gravel and pieces of white granite. It is sometimes carried to Coo massie in sobd lumps, imbedded in loam and granite, weighing together probably fourteen or"], [186, "158 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. fifteen pounds ; of which mass, one pound or one pound and a half is gold. The gold obtained from the mines is denominated rock-gold; and Mr. Dupuis is of opinion, that some of the lumps which he has seen suspended as ornaments at the wrists of the caboceers, would weigh as much as four pounds each. The Rev. Mr. Freeman also speaks of the large size of several of the masses of pure gold worn in the same way by caboceers when he was first introduced to the king. The amount of the precious metal which might be ob tabled is, however, incalculable; for many of the richest mines are dedicated to the national deities, and are thus protected from violation, by the powerful influence of the popular super stition. A small portion of the gold obtained in Ash antee (As-hanti) is sent down to the coast, and exchanged there for European manufactures. Another part is exported to Yahndi and Kong, and other neighbouring places, where it is manu factured into trinkets. The artists of Dagumba are especially celebrated for their workmanship. The remainder is sent to Jenneh and Timbuctoo, (Tumbuktu,) and from thence it is transported across the Great Desert to the countries on the shores of the Mediterranean. Between Ashantee and Tumbuktu there ap pears to be considerable intercourse maintained"], [187, "CHAPTER VI. 159 by means of the traders. Bowdich expressly states, that most of the sojourners, who were at Coomassie (Kumasi) during his mission to that capital, had visited Tumbuktu. And a Moor from that place gave a rircumstantial account of Mungo Park's death at Busah, of which himself had been witness. The narrative of Abu Bekr, more over, clearly shows that there is a constant com munication between Tumbuktu, Jenneh, Kong, and the borders of Ashantee. The exports of Ashantee to Dagumba are not confined to gold, but include iron, and a smab quantity of European merchandise ob tained from the coast. Many thousands of the Ashantees also obtain a bvebhood by catching fish in the lake Biiro, and drying it, for sale in the markets of Dagumba. Fishes of a large size, and of debcious flavour, are said to be conveyed abve from this lake to Salgha. The northern provinces of Ashantee (As-hanti) abound in elephants, the hunting of which is one of the chief occupations of the people. The natives of Yobati are said to be such expert hunters, that they alone, if required, could furnish the market of Coomassie with one hundred loads of ivory in the space of a month. The native productions exported from the Gold Coast are gold-dust, ivory, and palm-od. A"], [188, "160 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. species of ground-nut, which grows spontaneously, is at present attracting the attention of the merchants ; it being found to yield an excebent od for the table, which also burns beautifully in the lamp. This nut is a common product in ab that part of Africa, and is now extensively culti vated in the neighbourhood of the Gambia. In adverting to the languages or dialects of Ashantee (As-hanti) and the Gold Coast, it may be remarked, that language is a subject of inter esting scientific inquiry as web as of practical utihty. It is one of the most satisfactoiy indi cations ofthe affinities and relations of a people to other tribes and nations ; and a valuable guide in the attempt to trace the streams of human emigration, in their various meander ings, to their common source or head. The knowledge which Europeans have obtained of the languages of Africa, is very bmited and im perfect ; but Dr. J. C. Prichard, in his researches into the physical ethnography of the African races, is of opinion, that such data are extant as render it extremely probable that ab the idioms of Africa, including the language of the ancient Egyptians, are so albed \u2014 not, however, ni the manner or degree in which Semitic idioms re semble each other, but by strong analogies in their general principle of structure \u2014 as will go"], [189, "161 CHAPTER VI. far towards the proof of a common origin. Such a common source is also indicated by the traditionary notion prevalent in Ashantee, as web as in the northern parts of the African continent, that the original influx of population into Africa came from the east, some time after Misraim, the son of Ham, founded the empire of Egypt. By the aid of the Rev. W. B. Boyce's Kafir Grammar,* Dr. P. bebeves that he has dis covered one of the analogies to which he refers between that language and the Coptic, or ancient Egyptian. Tbe general conclusion to which he leans respecting the affinity of the African lan guages, and their derivation from a common source, is not materiaby affected by the fact, that \u2014 as appears from a brief outline furnished by the Rev. Mr. Isenberg, of the Church Mission ary Society \u2014 the language of the Gabas, a people dwelling in Shoa, or the southern part of Abys sinia, is, whbe partaking of the Semitic, evidently of Japhetic origin. Nor wib it considerably alter the question, should the theory of Mr. D'Eichtal, respecting the Malayan origin of the language of the Foulahs,t be estabbshed. Ab general rules admit of exceptions ; and although intermixtures of races have taken place, it may nevertheless be true, that the languages of Africa in general are t See Note C. * See Note B."], [190, "162 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. related to each other, and may truly claim a common parentage. The idioms of Western Africa, from Sene gambia to the Delta of the Niger, are divided by Dr. Prichard into ten classifications of lan guage. The Ashantee (As-hanti) and Fantee (Fanti) are of the Inta race; and are so nearly abke, that they can hardly be considered as two distinct dialects. Natives of these two countries, as the writer has had the opportunity of observ ing, converse together Avithout any apparent diffi culty. One difference between the two lan guages appears to consist in the substitution of one letter, or letters, for others, in the orthography of certain words, as for instance, the sybable ti in Ashantee is sometimes chi in Fantee. On examining the grammatical structure of the Fantee language, it wib be perceived that it has not the articles a and the. Neither has it any terminational variations, bke the Greek and Latin languages, to express the accusative, voca tive, and ablative cases of nouns. The nomi native and accusative, or objective, cases are abke; and the possessive is distinguished by an abbreviation of the relative pronoun affixed to it, or by placing first the word implying possession. The Fantees would not say, \" The queen of England ; \" \"A leaf of a tree ; \" \" The shining of"], [191, "163 CHAPTER VI. the moon;\" but, Abrukil hima, \"England's queen ; \" Idwia ahatau, \" Tree's leaf ; \" Busum efb, \" Moon's shining.\" The plural is formed by prefixing im or in to the singular; and in this respect the Fantee (Fanti) also exhibits a degree of simflarity to the Coptic, which abounds in prefixes. The fobowing are examples : \u2014 Benin Man. Im-benin...Men. Tabu Board. In- tabu ...Boards. Sometimes, however, changes take place in the initial letter of the singular, for the sake of euphony or brevity ; thus, im-benin is often pro nounced im-menin ; and idu, \" a tree,\" is in-dua in the plural, instead of in-idua. It may be remarked, that there are two words in Fantee for man, benin and berima, nearly equivalent in meaning to the Latin homo and vir, berima, like vir, being only used to dis tinguish a brave and ibustrious man. The adjective is placed after the noun ; as, Edan kesi House large. It is compared thus : \u2014 Edan awsurcsin House larger. Edan awsuwsin nin&ra ...House larger than all others."], [192, "164 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. The personal pronouns are declined thus : \u2014 FIRST PERSON Singular. Plural. I Emi We E-yen. Mine Midia Ours Ye-re-di-a. Me Mada Us I-yen-a-da. SECOND PERSON. Thou Ewu .. Thine Wu-dia Thee Wada.. Ye or you.E-won. Yours ...Wu-re-di-a. .You E-won\u2014 a-da. PERSON THIRD He and she ...Aw-nu They Won. His and hers. .Nidia Him and her .Nada .Theirs ...W6n-di-a. .Them W6n-a-da. The personal pronouns are used somewhat spar- ingly, the noun being often repeated where, in Engbsh, the pronoun would be introduced. Like the adjective, the demonstrative pronoun fobows the noun ; as, \u2014 Benin i-yi Man this. Benin awnu ...Man that. The conjugation of verbs, as in the Mandingo,* is effected principaby by means of pronouns, and by the use of particles which are affixed to the root of the verb. The pronouns undergo certain changes to express the several tenses. Thus, \u2014 * See Note D."], [193, "165 CHAPTER VI. I love is Emi daw, or mi daw. I loved Emi daw yi, or mi daw yi. I shall love Maw daw. In each of these instances it wib be perceived that the verb itself, daw, (\"to love,\") remains unchanged. In Fantee (Fanti) construction, the object does not, as in the Mandingo, precede the verb, but fobows it. The Fantee has some adverbs, although not so many as in the Engbsh language. It has the preposition from, but not to. Thus the Fantees say, Mi re kor Mansu, \"I going Mansu ; \" but when leaving, they say, \" Mi re fi Mansu, \" I going from Mansu.\" A peculiarity in Fantee construction may here be noticed. In the latter instance only, the particle re, which contains the force of the participle, is expressed, and the verb kor (\"to go\") is omitted, in order to introduce it before the name of the place to which the individual is removing. Thus, Mi re fi Mansu kor Kumasi : \" I going from Mansu to Kumasi.\" It may be added, that the Fantee has conjunc tions both conjunctive and disjunctive ; as, orb, \"and,\" andna, \"but.\" In this brief outbne of the Fantee language, the vowels and diphthongs are to be sounded according to the scheme given in the Preface."], [194, "166 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. With regard to the general character of the language, it may be remarked, that, owing to the great number of vowels and bquid letters which it contains, it is soft and harmonious in its expres sion. But it is deficient in synonymes, and in words conveying various shades of meaning, whbe agreeing in one general idea. Thus a person, in denying the correctness of a statement made by another, has no feebler mode of expressing his dissent than to teb him that he lies. It has been a topic of general remark by writers on the subject, that a considerable number of dialects are spoken on the Gold Coast; but Wilbam De Graft, whose vernacular tongue is the Fanti, observes, that he was able to make out, to a great extent, the meaning of the people in their own tongues, at ab the places which he has visited, from Dix Cove to Accra (Akrah). He understood less of the Accra dialect than any other. Possibly that dialect, and perhaps some of the others, may have been derived from an ear lier race of settlers than the emigration whose descendants now people that part of Africa. He at the same time confirms the remark of Meredith, that the Fantee language is gene raby known by the inhabitants, as web as their own dialects. Although he understood but bttle of the dialect of Accra, the people of that place understood him, when he preached to them in"], [195, "167 CHAPTER VI. Fantee. Owing to the ascendancy of Fantee, and the intercourse kept up with it by means of its traders, its language has become the general medium of communication along the coast. A Vocabulary of Fantee (Fanti) words, obtained from Mr. Wilbam De Graft, and printed in the bst of African Vocabularies, compbed for the use of the Niger Expedition, wdl be given in the Appendix.* The natives of this part of Africa are remark able for oratoiy, and wib discourse fluently on a given subject for hours. When Aga, whose his tory has been given in an earber part of the volume, was first brought to the notice of the king of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) the speech which he made in defence of his master occupied three hours in the debvery. Bowdich says, (but the statement is ridiculed by Dupuis,) that the water of a smab stream cabed the Bohmen is supposed to instil eloquence, and that a number of Ashan tees annually visit it to drink the inspiring draught. Whatever virtues may be ascribed to this water, oratory is certainly an accompbshment of that people. A taste for music is also extensively cultivated. * See Appendix II."], [196, "168 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Various kinds of instruments are used. The large drum is made out of part of a tree, which is bobowed, and covered at one end with a skin. This instrument is carried on the head of one man, and beaten with sticks by another. The smaller drums are hung round the neck of the performer, or placed on the ground, and played with the fingers. The most martial instrument is the large horn, made of the tusk of the elephant. The sound of this is powerful; and as every caboceer has his own peculiar air, which is uni versally known, the respective positions of ab the chiefs in the heat of battle are easby ascertained. Gong-gongs, made of iron, castanets, and rattles, are also in request. Among the most musical of the instruments is their flute, which is much larger than the kind used in Europe. The natives profess to be able to hold conversation through it with each other. The sanku, a speci men of winch bes before the writer, consists of a hobow wooden box, perforated with holes, and covered with a skin, to which is attached a long stick or neck; and it has eight strings, in two rows, supported perpendicularly by a bridge. This instrument, though somewhat resemhbng a viohn, is played with the fingers bke a guitar, and produces a soft and soothing tone. Some of the native songs are a kind of dialogue; and the parts are sung by individuals of each sex,"], [197, "169 CHAPTER VI. alternately rising from the ranks of the perform ers, who are ranged, with their sankus and other instruments, in opposite lines.

Were this important consideration to be overlooked in the effort of philanthropy to ele vate a dark and barbarous nation, painful dis appointment would be the inevitable result. It would be found that many of the irrational and inhuman customs which were expected to disap pear, on being contrasted with the enlightened practices and pursuits of civibzed strangers, are too firmly interwoven with the religious system of the people to yield to any other means than the introduction of a purer faith. Under the impression of these views, it wib be attempted to describe the prevalent superstitious practices of the natives of the Gold Coast, and of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) and, at the same time, to trace them to the principles on which they rest for support. Aud it may be observed, that a delineation of the rebgious system of these people wib afford a view of the superstitions which, under various modifi cations, extensively prevail among the other Negro tribes and nations of Western and Central Africa. It is a remarkable fact, that the notion of a Supreme Being bes at the very foundation of the rebgious system which it is proposed to describe. He is cabed Yankumpon,* from yanku, \"friend,\" * His name in the dialect of Accra is Numbo. \u2014 Isert. t 2"], [200, "172 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. and pon, \" great,\" or rather, \" very great ; \" for the word is used in a superlative sense. The meaning of the appebation thus appears to be \"very great,\" or \"greatest friend.\" To this name the Fantees sometimes prefix Nanah, that is, \" grandfather,\" or \" father of us ab.\" Another name used by the Fantees, recog nises this Supreme Deity as the creator of man. It is Yehmi, compounded of yeh, \" to make,\" and emi, \" me ; \" and the idea intended to be con veyed by it is, \" He made me.\" The Ashantees, moreover, ascribe to him everlasting existence, by giving him a title, written by Prince Wilham Quantamissah, Titiquarfrarmuah, which bteraby signifies, \" He endures for ever.\" How the polytheism of the natives is engrafted upon this doctrine of a Supreme Being, wib best appear from the tradition respecting the creation, which has prevabed among them, with some variations, from the earbest period of their history. It is bebeved that, in the beginning of the world, God, having created three white and three black men, with an equal number of women, of each colour, resolved, in order that they might be left without complaint, to allow them to fix their own destiny, by giving them the choice of good and evfl. A large box or calabash was, in consequence, placed upon the ground, together with a sealed paper or letter."], [201, "173 CHAPTER VII. The black men had the first choice, who took the calabash, expecting that it contained ab that was desirable ; but, upon opening it, they found only a piece of gold, some iron, and several other metals, of which they did not know the use. The white men opened the paper or letter, and it told them everything. Ab this is supposed to have happened in Africa, in which country, it is be beved, God left the Blacks, with the choice which their avarice had prompted them to make, under the care of inferior or subordinate deities; but conducted the Whites to the water-side, where he communicated with them every night, and taught them to bubd a smab vessel which car ried them to another country; from whence, after a long period, they returned with various kinds of merchandise to barter with the Blacks, whose perverse choice of gold, in preference to the knowledge of letters, had doomed them to inferiority. Is this notion of the judicial degra dation of the Blacks traceable to the curse pro nounced upon Ham? And is this again con founded with the result of man's probation in Paradise ? These are interesting questions ; but, however they may be decided, it is certain that in this tradition is to be found the source of those superstitions which enthral millions of the Negro race. The appebation which has been given by"], [202, "174 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Europeans to the divinities of tbe Blacks is Fetish, or Fetische, from the Portuguese word for witch craft; but the native name, used by the Ashantees and Fantees, is Bosum, or Suman, implying sacrecbiess ; and the Ashantees employ the word Tano also in the same sense. Juju, it appears, is the corresponding term in the languages spoken in the Delta of the Niger. These deities are identified with many of the most striking objects of nature. They are supposed to inhabit rivers. The river Tando is a favourite fetish among the Ashantees. So is the Adirai. Thus, one of the Ashantee warriors, while extobing the power of the king, and showing how difficult it was for his enemies to escape his vengeance, exclaimed, \" If they run to Adirai river, it is the kmg's fetish, and wib kib them. They cannot pass Tando river.\" The Prah is another of their divinities, and is denominated Bosumprah, or the sacred river. This river issues from a large gaping rock about half-way up the side of a mountain, near a little croom, called Samtasu. There the special presence of the god is supposed to abide; and sacrifices are consequently offered. On the northern bank of the river, at the place where it is crossed on the path leading to Cape- Coast Castle, there is a fetish-house or temple, where the Ashantee travebers make oblations"], [203, "175 CHAPTER VII. to the deity of the river, before they venture to plunge into the stream. The Sakum, a small river about four mbes westward from Accra, (Akrah,) is regarded, by the inhabitants of that place, as a great fetish. Its name is ever upon their bps, and to it the praise is ascribed when benefits are obtained, or eril averted. So greatly is this fetish esteemed at Accra, that it would be dangerous to speak disrespectfully of it in the hearing of the inhabitants. Lakes, as web as rivers, have a share of the public veneration. Thus the lake Echui is worshipped as the guardian-deity of the capital of Ashantee (As-hanti). At Cape-Coast town, two ponds, cahed Papratah and Buakiin, enjoy the honour of deification. The former is espe cially esteemed, because it has not faded to supply the inhabitants with water when besieged by their enemies. Remarkable mountains and rocks are also regarded with rebgious veneration. The cbff on which Cape-Coast Castle stands is the supposed residence of a great fetish, cabed Tahbil ; and, when the sea breaks loudly against it, the natives say, \" The god is firing.\" Some kinds of trees are also esteemed as fetishes, and are always left untouched when the ground on which they stand is cleared for cultivation. The animate creation, moreover, furnishes other"], [204, "176 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. objects of superstitious veneration. Some ani mals (as leopards, panthers, and wolves) and dangerous reptbes (as serpents) are bebeved to be the messengers of the gods; and others are worshipped as the bving incarnations of certain deities. At Dix Cove, the crocodbe has obtained divine honours. It is kept in a large pond near the fort; and any person, going ashore at that place, may obtain a sight of it at the expense of a white fowl and a bottle of ardent spirits. The fetishman takes the fowl and the bquor, and, proceeding to the pond, makes a pecubar noise with his mouth, on which the crocodbe comes forth, and receives the fowl as his share of the present. When Mr. Wibiam De Graft resided at Dix Cove, he frequently witnessed the fetish man calling the crocodbe out of the pond, to gratify the curiosity of Europeans. On leaving the water, the animal would run to the fetishman, who, as it approached within two or three feet, would throw the white fowl into its mouth, and then pour out a httle of the rum upon the ground. And he has frequently ob served, that when there was any delay on the part of the fetishman in presenting the fowl, the crocodbe would immediately make towards any person or persons present who were dressed in white, and pursue them until the fowl was thrown in his way. Some years ago, Mr. Hutchinson"], [205, "177 CHAPTER VII. and Captain Leavens were exposed to consider able risk ; for the fowl having escaped out of the hand of the fetishman into the bush, the croco dbe pressed them so closely, that had not a dog crossed the path, of which the animal made a repast, one of them would, most probably, have fallen a victim to its rapacity. The voracious creature frequently carries off sheep and dogs from the neighbourhood of the pond, and will also attack chbdren. On his first going to Dix Cove, Wilham De Graft was cautioned by a native merchant to beware of approaching the crocodbe, which had recently seized his daugh ter, and would undoubtedly have devoured her, had not the means of rescue been at hand. The crocodbe which formerly received cbvine honours at Dix Cove was much larger than the present one; but he grew so tame, that he was accustomed to leave the water of his own accord, and proceed to the houses of the fetish man and the king, to receive his offering of a white fowl. In Fantee, (Fanti,) there is a place called Embrotan, whose inhabitants might be imagined to have descended from the ancient worshippers of Baalzebub ; for they carefuhy preserve a num ber of flies in a smab temple, and honour them as fetishes. To the various deities, furnished by the i 5"], [206, "178 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. animate and inanimate creation, artificial repre sentations are added. Some of the images, to which rebgious offerings are presented, are made of wood, rudely carved, so as to resemble the human form, birds, and certain beasts, and covered with red ochre and eggs. Others are made of various materials, and of arbitrary forms. This vast assemblage of objects of worship is capable of a regular classification. Some may be regarded as tbe tutelar deities of the nation at large. Such is the great fetish at Abrah, in the Braffo country, which from time immemorial has been venerated in this character. Others have under their care particular towns. The inhabitants of Cape-Coast town congratulate themselves that they enjoy the protection of seventy-seven fetishes. Every town has one fetish-house or temple, often more, bubt of mud or swish, in a square or oblong form, and thatched over ; or constructed of sticks or poles placed in the ground in a circular form, and then tied together at the top and thatched. In these tem ples several images are generaby placed. Like the ancient Canaanites, the people always plant a grove, where they build a place of idol-worship ; under the shade of which grove their supersti tious rites are celebrated. Every fetishman or priest, moreover, has his private fetishes in his"], [207, "179 CHAPTER VII. \u2022own house. Wilham De Graft describes one of those private cobections which he had the oppor tunity of examining, as consisting of images of men, one of a bb'd, stones encircled with strings, large lumps of cinders from an iron furnace, calabashes, and bundles of sticks tied together with strings. Ab these were stained with red ochre, and rubbed over with eggs. They were placed on a square platform, and shrouded by a curtain from the vulgar gaze. Then there are the domestic fetishes ; for, like the Romans, the natives have their penates, or household gods. These are, in some cases, small images, in others a stone, about a foot square, with a bamboo string tied round it, or a calabash containing a string of beads. And, whatever may be the form or the materials, red ochre and eggs are invariably the covering. These household fetishes are sometimes placed on the outside of a house, by the door, but most frequently in a corner of the room within, covered by a curtain. Whde contemplating this extensive pantheon, it must, however, be noticed that the natives do not appear to regard the material objects them selves as deities. The fetishes are bebeved to he spiritual, intelligent beings, who make the remark able objects of nature their residence, or enter occasionaby into the images and other artificial representations, which have been duly conse-"], [208, "180 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. crated by certain ceremonies. It is the belief of the people, that the fetishes not unfrequently render themselves visible to mortals. Thus the great fetish of the rock on which Cape-Coast Castle stands, is said to come forth in the night in human form, but of superhuman size, and to proceed through the town, dressed in white, to chase away the evb spirits. This serves to explahi the fear manifested by the king of Ashantee when, supposing the moving figures of the magic lanthorn to be fetishes, he laid hold of Dupuis, and appeared afraid to be left alone with them in the dark. Further, evidence wib be subsequently given on this point ; but it may here be remarked, that the notions entertained by the natives of spiritual beings are, after ab, very incongruous. They bebeve that these fetishes are of both sexes, aud that they require food, as though they pos sessed au animal nature. The notion of a future state uuiversahy prevafls. It is bebeved that, at death, the soul passes into another world, where it exists in a state of con sciousness and activity. And it is worthy of remark, that although the native term for ghost or soul \u2014 sunsum or saman \u2014 does not, bke the Hebrew word for the spirit or soul of man, \u2014 ruach, \u2014 in its primary meaning, denote the air or wind, yet the natives conceive of the soul under that simihtude. They say it is like the wind, and"], [209, "CHAPTER VII. 181 that it can come into a room when the doors are closed, and there is no visible entrance. They firmly bebeve that the spirits of dead persons frequently appear to the bring. The Rev. Mr. Thompson, a clergyman, who spent some time on the Gold Coast nearly a century ago, although evidently not disposed to be over credulous upon the subject, mentions the fol lowing circumstance, which he had from good authority. \"A caboceer, walking one day to a neighbouring croom or town along the sea-sands, saw a man before him coming forward in great haste, whom he was web acquainted with ; and as he drew near, being stib intent upon his speed, he called to him to stop a bttle. The other, making signs that he was in a hurry, ran past him, and continued his pace. When he came to the town, finding a concourse of people in the market-place, he asked the reason of it, and was told, that sueh a man's head had just then been taken off. He said, it could not be, for he had met him in the way, and spoken to him. But the answer was made, that it was so; and if he questioned the truth of it, he might see the parts of him, and be convinced by his own eyes.\" The people bebeve that the spirits of their departed relatives exercise a guardian care over them; and they wib frequently stand over the graves of their deceased friends, and invoke their"], [210, "182 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. spirits to protect them and their chddren from barm. It is imagined that the spirit lingers about the house some time after death. If the children be ib, the blness is ascribed to the spirit of the deceased mother having embraced them. Elderly women are often heard to offer a kind of prayer to the spirit of a departed parent, begging it either to go to its rest, or, at least, to protect the famby, by keeping off eril spirits, instead of injuring the chddren or other members of the family by its touch. The ghosts of departed enemies are considered by the people as bad spirits, which have power to injure them. The gloom of the forest is supposed to be the haunt or abode of the eril spirits ; and tra vebers into the interior have mentioned, that, when overtaken on their journey by the night, then* native attendants have manb'ested great fear, and have made the forest resound again with their shouts and yebs, uttered with the intent to drive the evil spbits away. But although the natives have some notion of the spirituality of the soul, they have other opi nions, utterly incompatible with a correct idea of its immateriabty. They suppose that their friends live over again, in the other world, the bves which they led on earth ; and that they eat and drink, live in the same state, and engage in the same pursuits, as when they were in the present world."], [211, "183 CHAPTER VII. This belief exerts a powerful influence upon the minds of the natives, and leads to the most tragic results. If then friends are to resume in another world the state they maintained in this, then it is deemed necessary to send after them their wives and attendants ; and thus the death of an individual becomes the signal for the whole sale murder of his household. It may be further remarked, that whbe the natives entertain notions inconsistent with a cor rect idea of the spirituality of the soul, they do not appear to have a just conception of its immor tality. Wibiam De Graft says that, when he resided at Winnebah, he witnessed several in stances of the Heathen digging up the bones of persons who had long been dead, and burning them ; under the idea, that so long as any of the bones were left in an undecayed state, the spirits of the former possessors of the bodies were able to injure them, but that when the bones were con sumed, there was an end of them and their power. The existence of the devb is also an article of Negro hebef. He is cabed by the Fantees and Ashantees, Abonsum, or Aiyen. This eril being is supposed to be ever at hand for purposes of mischief; for when a person rises from his seat, his attendants are accustomed immediately to be down upon their side, to prevent the deril from sbpping into their master's place. Whatever may"], [212, "184 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. be the case in other parts of Africa, it does not appear that the devil is worshipped by the Fantees and Ashantees ; on the contrary, he is annuaby driven away on the Gold Coast, with great form and ceremony. This custom is observed at Cape- Coast town, about the end of August. Prepara tion is made for the ceremony in the course of the day ; as the hour of eight o'clock in the evening draws nigh, the people are seen cobecting in groups in the streets, armed with sticks, muskets, and other weapons ; at the instant when the eight o'clock gun is fired from the castle, a tremendous shouting, accompanied with the firing of muskets, breaks forth from ab parts of the town ; and the people rush into their houses, and beat about with their sticks in every corner, shouting and haboo ing with ab their strength. This sudden outburst of ab kinds of noises often alarms Europeans who have recently arrived, inducing them to suppose that an enemy has attacked the place. When it is imagined that the deril is excluded from ab the houses, a simultaneous rush is then made out of the town, and the people in a body pursue the invisible enemy, with lighted flambeaux, shouts, and the firing of muskets, until it is concluded that he is completely routed and put to flight. After this achievement, they return ; and, in some of the towns, the women proceed to wash and purify their wooden and earthen ves-"], [213, "185 CHAPTER VII. sels, to prevent the deril from returning to their houses. To cab another \" deril,\" is a very great insult ; and should the person who has thus been abused shortly after die, his death is ascribed to the influ ence of the eril spirit in the person who insulted him. When such a circumstance occurs, painful results generaby fobow; for the friends of the deceased do not fab to seek satisfaction. Some traces of the sabbath are found in this part of Africa. The natives reckon time by moons; and the arbitrary division of weeks, which can only be satisfactorily accounted for by the original institution of the sabbath, was evidently known among them before they had an opportunity to learn it from Europeans. The names of the days in the week, in the several branches of the Inta or Ashantee (As hanti) language, are native terms ; and may he traced in the national customs backward to re mote antiquity. The same day of the week is not, however, universahy observed as the sab bath. When Mr. Freeman preached at Fomu nah, and explained the Decalogue, Korinchi after wards referred to the Fourth Commandment, and said he had entertained the bebef, that God had appointed for each nation its own sacred day; \u2014 that he had set apart one day for the Ashantees, another for the Fantees, a different one for the"], [214, "186 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Wassaws, and others for other people. He could not, of course, support his bebef by any show of argument : he had received it by tradition ; and referred Mr. Freeman for proof to the wonderful old fetishman in the interior, who is supposed to know ab things, and to be able to do ab things. But the apprehensions expressed by several who were present at the discussion, that they would expose themselves to great danger, should they substitute the Christian sabbath for their own weekly fetish-day, is evidence of the influence which their superstitions exert on their minds. In all the countries along the coast, the regular fetish-day is Tuesday, the day which is observed by the king of Ashantee (As-hanti). Other days in the week are held sacred in the bush. On this weekly sabbath, or fetish-day, the people generaby dress themselves in white garments, and mark their faces, and sometimes their arms, with white clay. They also rest from labour. The fishermen would expect, that were they to go out on that day, the fetish would be angry, and spob their fishing ; and, in the interior, should a man go into his plantation on the sabbath, and by chance see a panther or leopard there, it would be concluded, that the fetish, who knew his inten tion to labour, had sent its messenger, to prevent him from carrying his purpose into effect. The people, moreover, regard their natal day"], [215, "187 CHAPTER VII. with a kind of religious veneration ; and honour the day of the week on which they were born with some of the observances practised on the fetish-day, or sabbath. Time is further distributed into lucky and un- lucky days and weeks ; but every nation appears to have its own peculiar mode of division. In Ahanta, they divide time into periods of three weeks. The first week, named Adai, is regarded as the \"good week ;\" and in this week much work is done. Traders then visit the market more fre- quently than at any other time ; bebeving that every thing they do during its continuance must assuredly prosper. The second is Ajamfo, or \" the bad week,\" in which no trade is carried on ; as the natives are persuaded, that whatever is under- taken in that week wib certainly fab. The third is the \" little-good week,\" cabed Adim, in which they both work and trade, but not so much as in the first, or Adai, week. In some countries, the great fortunate time lasts nineteen days, and the lesser, seven days. Between these two periods, is an interval of seven eril or inauspicious days, on which they neither travel, tbl their land, nor engage in any business of importance. The people of Aquambii, it has been said, would not so much as accept any presents on those days, but either returned them to the owner, or left them in a separate place, untd the"], [216, "188 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. arrival of the fortunate days, before they made use of them. In Ashantee, (As-hanti,) the number of good or lucky days, it has been estimated, is about one hundred and fifty or sixty in the year; and, during the eril days, councds cannot be held, nor can troops either march, or engage the enemy. Incredible time is thus spent before any national concern can be undertaken; for, ab the prepa ratory rebgious mysteries can only be celebrated on the particular days of the week or month which are deemed auspicious. Some months con tain a greater number of fortunate days than others. September, for instance, is a more highly favoured month in this respect than the pre ceding. Ashantee couriers, travelbng with despatches in September, will go from Coo massie (Kumasi) to Cape-Coast Castle in twelve days ; but they have been known to spend thirty days of the month of August in this journey, in consequence of the interruption occasioned by the more frequent recurrence of inauspicious days. The priests and priestesses of the national superstition \u2014 the fetish-men and fetish-women \u2014 constitute a numerous order. One class are attached to the public fetish-houses or temples, at some of which a very considerable number are placed. At the house or temple of the prin-"], [217, "189 CHAPTER VII. cipal fetish of the Ahanta country, upwards of fifty superior priests are said to be resident ; and the great fetish at Abrah also, it is known, has a numerous attendance. Another class of fetishmen itinerate through the country, remaining six or twelve months at a place, according as their services may be in demand by the inhabitants. The priestly office may, in some cases, be here ditary, but it is not uniformly so ; for the chdd ren of fetishmen sometimes refuse to devote themselves to the pursuits of their parents, and engage in other occupations. Any one may enter the office after suitable training ; and parents who desire that their chddren may be instructed in its mysteries, place them with a fetishman, who receives a premium for each. The order of fetishmen is further augmented by persons who declare, that the fetish has suddenly seized, or come upon, them. A series of convul sive and unnatural bodfly distortions estabbshes their claims. The revenue of the fetishmen is derived from the bberabty of the people. A moiety of the offerings which are presented to the fetish belongs to the priests ; and this is very consider able in amount. The king of Ashantee's offering is said to be generally ten ounces of gold ; and that of his subjects in proportion to their respect-"], [218, "190 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. ive ranks. The denial of protection to run-away slaves is another source of emolument. It is the acknowledged privilege of a slave to forsake his master, and devote himself to the service of the fetish ; and, in Ahanta, when a slave has once reached the fetish-house he is safe ; for his pro prietor would consider that the death of ab his famby would be inevitable, were he to take him back from the sanctuary. But in Ashantee (As-hanti) and other places, the priests have relaxed the strictness of this ride ; and, on receiv ing a fee of two ounces of gold and four sheep, they wib debver up tbe fugitive slaves to their master, and absolve him from ab the eril conse quences which might be apprehended from their return into his family. The income of the fetish men varies according to the dignity and reputa tion of the fetishes to whose service they are devoted. It has been remarked by Meredith, that the great oracle at Abrah was inaccessible to the poor and indigent. In consequence of it acknowledged superiority, the required amount of offerings was so great, that it could only be ap proached by the more opulent classes of society. The influence of the fetishmen rests upon the universaby-received principle, that whatever erils afflict men are produced by supernatural means, and can only be counteracted or removed by supernatural agency , \u2014 in other words, that evils"], [219, "191 CHAPTER VII. can only be removed, and desired benefits con ferred, by the fetishes ; and that then* friendly interposition must be sought through the medium of their servants or ministers. This doctrine, it wib be perceived, puts the people completely into the power of the priesthood, and whoby abandons them as victims to its rapacity. To keep up the delusion, and maintain their influence, the fetishmen bave recourse to a variety of means. They exert themselves to obtain ab kinds of information. With this view, they employ agents in various parts of the country, who make them acquainted with ab that is passing within the range of their observation. The fetishmen themselves, also, when on their travels, industriously cobect the news as they pass along ; and when one of them enters a town, with a view to practise his profes sion there for a time, his first business is, to shut himself up for a few days, until he ascertains by secret inquiries what subjects are engaging the pubbe attention, who are sick, and what is the private history of the principal inhabitants. In these ways, the fetishmen acquire such an amount of information as serves to astonish then dupes, and to strengthen the popular bebef in their supernatural powers. The success of the fetishmen is further pro moted by their acting in concert. They commu-"], [220, "192 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. nicate to each other the information they respect ively cobect, and agree upon the line of operations which they shab pursue. A short time since, a person residing at a croom, in the neighbourhood of Salt Pond, was hunting in a very secluded part of the bush, when he came upon a company of about twenty fetishmen; who had retired thither, to lay their plans for promoting the interests of then craft, at the public expense- He bstened for some time to their conversation, unperceived, and might probably have kept then secret, had not his superstitious fears been partly dissipated by the subsequent appbcation of the truths of the Gospel to his mind. At Djuquah, likewise, two fetishmen were lately overheard in a violent dispute, when one threatened, that unless the other would lend him a sum of money, he would make an exposure of the plans by which he had assisted him to deceive and fleece the people. The fetishmen apply themselves, moreover, to the study of medicine ; and the knowledge which they acquire of the properties of herbs and plants, it wib be seen hereafter, powerfuby contributes to strengthen their influence with the people."], [221, "CHAPTER VIII.

The daily household-worship of the people, in itself, furnishes no mean proof of the constant pressure from their superstitious notions under which they act. In the morning, the master of the house wbl take water in a calabash, and, pouring it upon the ground, before the door of his house, wbl pray to the fetish, to the effect that he (the fetish) is to wash his face, that he may be better prepared to watch over the household on that day, and may discern more clearly what wib be the best for them. Sometimes an offering of a fowl is made. When Mr. Dupuis was on his journey to Coo massie, (Kumasi,) he was aroused from sleep one morning at an early hour, at the place where he had stopped for the night, by the entrance of a man, whom he discovered to be the master of the house, with a present for his tutelary god, which in this case happened to be a tree, growing at the door of the apartment where he (Dupuis) lodged. The offering, which consisted of a white and speckled fowl, and a smab calabash containing a little corn and plantain, steeped in a fluid looking bke blood, was, in the first instance, placed on the ground, close by the tree; but afterwards, the"], [223, "195 CHAPTER VIII. members of the fowl were severed from each other, and suspended by a piece of cotton-yarn upon one of the lowest branches. A blackish fluid, contained in another calabash, was then poured out at the root of the tree as a bbation, during the recital of a prayer which Dupuis did not understand. The washing of the stem of the tree, with a colouring made from grey and white clay, concluded the ceremony. Previous to going abroad in the morning, it is not unusual that a person endeavours to fortify himself from some special evil, by having recourse to other fetish practices. One morning, when Mr. Hutchinson cabed on Apdko, this distinguished caboceer began to consult his fetish, by a number of strings, having various ornaments on one end, to denote then good or evil quahties. These were mixed promiscuously together; and, taking them in his right hand, he put them behind his back, and drew out one by one with his left. This was repeated about twenty times. A wicker-basket was then brought, on a smab stool, covered with a silk cloth. It contained two lumps, bke pin cushions, made of eggs, palm-ofl, and other ingredients. Taking the stool, he turned it upside down, and, making three holes in it with an instrument resembling a shoemaker's awl, he drove in an equal number of pegs with a stone, muttering to himself ab the time, and waving __ 2"], [224, "196 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. each string round his right ear. An egg was then brought in, broken at one end, which, having been placed alternately on the lumps in the basket, was crushed upon the stool where the pegs had been inserted. The whole of this ceremony, Apdko said, he repeated every morn ing, for the express purpose of keeping him out of bad palavers ab the day. With such superstitious ceremonies and prac tices the day begins ; and during its progress, no food is taken without a recognition of the claims of rebgion. Before eating and drinking, a bttle of the bquid, and a portion of the food, are thrown upon the ground for the fetish, and the spirits of departed relatives. Appbcation is made to the fetishes for counsel and aid in every domestic and pubbe emergency. When persons find occasion to consult a private fetishman, they take a present of rum and gold-dust, and proceed to his house. He receives the present, and either puts a little of the rum on the head of every image, or pours a smab quantity upon the ground before the platform, as an offering to the whole pantheon : then taking a brass pan with water in it, he sits down with the pan between himself and the fetishes ; and the inquirers also seat themselves to await the result. Having made these preparatory arrangements, looking earnestly into the water, he begins to"], [225, "197 CHAPTER VIII. snap his fingers, and, addressing the fetish, extols his power ; tebing him that people have arrived to consult him, and requesting him to come and give the desired answer. After a time he is wrought up, bke Virgb's Sibyl, into a state of fury ; he shakes violently, and foams at the mouth. Tins is to intimate that the fetish has come upon him ; and that he himself is no longer the speaker, but the fetish, who uses his mouth, and speaks by him. He now growls bke a tiger, and asks the people if they have brought rum, requiring them, at the same time, to present it to him. He drinks, and then inquires, why they have come, and for what purpose they have sent for him. If a relative is ib, they reply that such a member of their famby is sick ; that they have tried ab the means they could devise to restore him, but without success ; and that, knowing he is a great fetish, they have come to ask his aid, and beg him to teach them what they should do. He then speaks kindly to them, expresses a hope that he shah be able to help them, and says, \" I go up to see.\" It is imagined that the fetish then quits the priest ; and after a sbence of a few minutes, he is supposed to return, and gives his response to the inquiry. But what is this \"going up to see?\" The people believe, that the fetish has four eyes, and conclude that, therefore, he can see better than"], [226, "198 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. mortals, who have only two ; and some understand that the fetish goes up to the sky to look around for the cause of the disease, and for the cure. But the fetishmen themselves, when arguing with Wilham De Graft in defence of their system, have insisted, that the fetish goes up to Yankumpon, the Supreme Being ; and they have urged this as a reason for refusing to embrace Christianity. Their argument has been : \" As the fetishes derive ab their power and wisdom from God, why forsake them ? \" Latterly, however, as they perceive that the people, under the teaching of the missionaries, are disposed to reject this mode of reasoning, and go to God at once, the priests do not appear to admit so freely the dependence of their deities upon a higher power. When a principal chief is ib, or when any pubbe calamity has taken place, the inhabitants of the town repair to the pubbe temple, or fetish house, to propitiate the fetish, who is supposed to be angry because his offerings have not been duly presented; and who has therefore either himself appomted the afflictive visitation, or has abowed some eril spirit to inflict it upon them. The illness of the chief, however, is shrewdly traced up by the priests to his neglect of the prescribed customs for a departed relative, or some other simbar offence. On these occasions, the drums belonffhisr to the \u25a0**\u00bb c- D"], [227, "199 CHAPTER VIII. temple are brought forth. These are made of large calabashes, one end being cut off, covered with goat-skin. The persons who play them sit upon the ground under the shade of the grove, and beat them with their hands. Ab thmgs being ready, the priest selects and commences a fetish song, which the people sing ; wlibe they beat the drums, and the attendant fetishmen dance with ab their might. Wlibe thus engaged, the priests are often excited into a state of frenzy, which is regarded as evidence that the fetish himself has entered into them ; and at the end of the song the fetish is supposed to speak in the priest, and give intimations of his wib to the people. Previous to his beginning to speak, the priest lays his hand upon the drums, and sflence ensues. Having ended his communication, he commences another song, and the former scene is renewed. After a length of time, perhaps when fatigued, the priest dances very slowly, and debvers his oracles to the people as he passes softly by them. On some of these occasions he wbl rush out of the circle, and run into the house of a principal person, to teb him what to do in order to avert some eril which he foresees is coming upon the famby ; and for such intima tions he does not fab to receive the usual pre sent. It has been stated, that some of the fetish-"], [228, "200 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. houses are buflt in a conical form, with long sticks or poles placed in the ground, tied together at the top, and thatched. When a fetish dance takes place before one of these, a priest places himself at the entrance, to prevent the people from looking in. They are told, that when the fetish comes down to his temple, they wbl see it move. And verily they do. As the drum ming, singing, and dancing proceed, the temple begins to rock backward and forward, which the people are led to bebeve is effected by the fetish, who has descended, and is dancing upon the temple. This deception is managed by a fetish man, who, before the people come together, places himself on a cross-seat in the building, near the top, where he is able to shake with ease the whole fabric. The stationing of another fetishman before the door, is to prevent the people from discovering the true cause of the phenomenon which they witness. Sometimes the town-fetish does not wait to be consulted, but summons the inhabitants to his temple. On such occasions, the priests profess that the fetish has come upon them. They run about the town bke frantic persons, eating raw eggs, using the most extravagant gestures, and tebbig the people that the fetish has a communi cation to make to them. On this, the inhabitants take the accustomed presents, and hasten to the"], [229, "CHAPTER Vill. 201 fetish-house; and the usual scene of drumming, singing, and dancing, is exhibited. In cases of great difficulty, the oracle at Abrah is the last resort of the Fantees. This has always been held in the highest estimation. Previous to the Ashantee (As-hanti) war, there was in the neighbourhood a deep and almost impervious deb, inhabited by a number of aged fetishmen, whom the people bebeved to be immortal, and to have bved there beyond ab memory, in intimate converse with the fetish, and with the departed spirits of the aged and the wise. Adoko, the chief of the Braffoes, fre- quently consulted them, either in his own person, or through his head fetishman ; and the Fantees afterwards attributed the success of the Ashan- tees, and their own defeats and misfortunes, to their disregard of the injunctions of the oracle. Abrah is now in ruins ; but the fetish maintains his reputation; partly by the influence of the fetishmen in the country, who advise the people to go thither in cases of great emergency, and partly by means of the information conveyed to Abrah by the agents of the oracle. Frequently, when inquirers go from a distance, they are sur-. prised to find that the fetishmen are already acquainted with many of then\" own private affairs; and often it happens, that, on the strength of the secret information which they k 5"], [230, "202 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. have obtained, the priests send such messages to persons living in remote places as tend to cherish and confirm the popular impression, that they possess supernatural means of obtaining knowledge. The people throughout the country would be afraid, were they disposed, to speak disrespectfully of the Abrah fetish ; for they bebeve that he would hear them, catch them up into the sky, and make them drawers of water, or would inflict upon them some other severe punishment. This notable oracle is always consulted at night. It is not allowed to visit, during the day, the sacred thicket from which the response is given. Any of the natives, rambling within the precincts of the enclosure, would be severely fined; and if an European were seen approach ing, the fetishmen would endeavour to dis suade him from entering it. When the inquirers arrive at night, they find a large fire made upon the ground ; and the presents which they have brought they place in .he hands of the priests, who are in attendance. But sometimes they are told, that they shall have the honour of giving them to the fetish himself. They are then directed to elevate their presents above then' beads, and to fix their eyes steadfastly upon the ground j for should they look up, the fetish, it is said, would inflict blindness upon them, for then sacri-"], [231, "203 CHAPTER VIII. legious gaze. Who or what it is, in the over hanging branches of the trees, that receives the presents, wbl be readby conjectured. The visit ants are then instructed to sit down, and look into the fire, without turning their heads aside, or speaking to each other ; and two or three priests go round the company, and receive their applica tions. After a time, the oracle gives a response, in a smab, shrill voice, intended to convey the idea, that it proceeds from an unearthly source ; and the inquirers, having attained the end of their visit, then depart. All possible precautions are used to inspire the people with awe and fear, in order to deter any persons from visiting this oracle from motives of mere curiosity. It is inculcated, that, should any one go thither who is not a devoted bebever in the fetish, he would he immediately discovered, and summarily punished; and the fate of one unbebering and irreverent visitant is dweff upon with great solemnity. It is stated, that when he arrived, and sat down by the fire, a chain came down from the thicket, and dragged him up to the skies,, where he is now employed in drawing up water from the sea, which the fetishes send back to the earth, in answer to the appbcations made to them for rain. What are the remedies prescribed by the fetish ? \u25a0or what are the means which the inquirers are"], [232, "204 ASHANTEE- AND THE GOLD COAST. directed to use for the attainment of their object ? \u25a0becomes now a subject for inquiry. In cases of bodily affliction, a medical prepara tion is ordered for the patient. It has already been noticed, that the fetish men and women apply themselves assiduously to the study of the healing art, and acquire such a knowledge of the properties of herbs and plants as enables them to effect the cure of many complaints. And this knowledge is artfuhy employed to foster the pub be superstition. In administering medicine, they invariably teb the patient, that it has not been found out by their own skib, but that the fetish has taught them how to make it strong, so as to meet his case. It is backed, moreover, during the healing process, by occasional fetish practices ; such as the binding of strings round the knees and other joints of the patient, the ends of the strings which hang down after the knots are tied being covered -with a red vegetable appbeation. And the professed object of this is, to strengthen the operation of the medicine, and, at the same time, prevent the eril spirits from handling the sick person, and increasing his complaint by their injurious touch. If the malady of the patient does not appeal* to yield to such appbeations, the fetish is again consulted ; and, in some cases, as a further expe dient, the priest takes a fowl or cat, and ties"], [233, "205 CHAPTER VIII. it to a stick, by which operation it is barbarously squeezed to death. The stick is then placed in the path leading to the house, for the purpose of deterring or hindering the eril spirits from approaching it. When the patient is known to be a rich man, a present of gold-dust is required, and sheep are directed to be offered. Mr. Bowdich states, that during the ibness of his native guide at Coomassie, (Kumasi,) several sheep were sacri ficed, and that he was fetished until the last mo ment, and died amidst the howls of a number of old fetish-women, who continued to besmear, with eggs, and other ingredients, the wabs, door-posts, and everything about him, untb he had ceased to breathe. The sickness of persons of the highest order is frequently attended with more serious consequences than the slaughter of sheep and fowls. During the ibness of Osai Tutu Quamina, it is stated that young virgins were regularly sacrificed to the fetish on certain days in the week, for the recovery of his health. For the purpose of fortifying the appbcant against any apprehended eril, some kind of fetish preparation is made, which he is directed to wear about his person ; and should it fab to accom pbsh the desfred end, the blame is invariably thrown upon the wearer. It is abeged that he has neglected some necessaiy condition, or in some way or other offended the fetish ; and the"], [234, "..\u25a0IK\".

A few years previous to that period, when enter- ing upon the Gaman or Buntuku war, in 1817, he was employed in rebgious preparations during a period of several weeks. Not only in the capital, but at several other places, the king presented fetish offerings in furtherance of the undertaking. According to the account of those transactions which Dupuis received from a native, it appears, that the monarch, in the first instance, cobected together his priests, and proceeded to consult the gods by a succession of human sacrifices. After fifty persons \u2014 thirty-two males, and eighteen females \u2014 had perished, the royal councd decided that the answers returned by the priests were unsatisfactory. The king was then directed to make a custom at the sepulchres of his ancestors ; and when the blood of many hundreds of human victims had been shed, the priests announced that the wrath of the adverse deities was appeased, and that they were at length disposed to favour the arms of the king. A certain composition was then prepared by the priests, which they debvered to the king, with a strict injunction to burn it daby in a consecrated fire-pot within the palace. On no account was the fire to become extinct in consequence of neglect; for, so long as the sacred flame should continue to destroy the com-"], [236, "ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. 208 position, the king, it was abeged, would not fail to triumph over his enemies. Encouraged by the assurances which he re ceived, the king prepared to join his army, and committed to his eldest sister, at that time the governess of the empire, or queen of the females, the task of watching over the sacred mystery ; informing her that both his crown and his life depended upon her vigflance. To assist her, he selected three of his favourite wives, who were to attend by turns, and prevent the fire from being extinguished. To this trust, however, the sister proved unfaithful. After the king had been some time absent, she formed a con nexion with a chief of Bouromy, whose ambition led him to aspire to the throne of Ashantee (As-hanti). Seventeen of the king's wives and their fambies are said to have joined in the con spiracy; when the mysterious flame was extin guished, the fire-pot was broken to pieces; and the rebelbous chief openly began to arm his fol- lowers in maintenance of his claims. With this state of things, the king, it was bebeved, became acquainted by supernatural means. Surprised at the severe checks which he received in the early part of the war, he caused an incantation to be performed over a certain talisman, for the purpose of ascertaining why the results of the campaign proved so contrary to"], [237, "CHAPTER VIII. 209 those winch he had been encouraged to expect ; when he is said to have obtained an insight into what was going on in his own capital. The fetishmen who were with him in the camp, had doubtless received private information from Coo- massie, (Kumasi,) which they communicated to the king as though it had been revealed by the oracle. The sequel may be briefly stated. The king immediately despatched Ossu Kujoh, with a body of troops, who speedby and effectually crushed the rebellion. When the king himself returned victorious, at the end of the war, he summoned a councd to dehberate upon the pun- ishment to be inflicted upon the offenders; and it was finaby decreed, that the offending wives should suffer death by decapitation; but, to avoid the profanation of spihing royal blood, the sister of the king was ordered to be strangled, (her younger sister being elevated to her office of governess of the females,) and the chief, her paramour, and ab his party, were doomed to undergo the most cruel deaths, at the grave of the king's mother. By the execution of these sentences, which were promptly carried into effect, it is said, seven hundred individuals perished. In their preparations for war, the Ashantees have recourse to the Moors, who visit or reside at the capital, as web as to their own fetishmen."], [238, "210 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Enormous prices are sometimes paid for the fetishes or charms, manufactured by those fol lowers of the Prophet. The king, it is stated, gave for the fetish- or war-coat of Apoko, the value of thirty-seven slaves ; and he paid, accord ing to the same scale, for the war-dresses of several other chiefs, varied only with respect to the rank which they respectively sustained. For a smab fetish, consisting of six lines of writing, enclosed in red cloth only, whieh the king pre sented to Mr. Bowdich's bnguist, he gave six ackies * of gold. Sometimes the fetish is cased in gold instead of cloth. A single, sheet of writing paper is sufficient for a great number of charms; as a very smab sbp only wbl contain the mystical sentence. To these cabalistic preparations the most extraordinary virtues are ascribed. The Ashan tees firmly bebeve, that they greatly contribute to make them invulnerable in war; that they paralyze the hand, and shiver the weapons, of the enemy, and divert the course of the babs. Seve ral of the Ashantee (As-hanti) captains seriously offered to allow Mr. Bowdich to fire at them; and such is the confidence which the warriors of that nation generahy repose in these mystical defences, that they rush fearlessly and headlong * Sixteen ackies make an ounce."], [239, "211 CHAPTER VIII. into the midst of the greatest dangers. In the praises of one of the great captains, proclaimed on a pubbe occasion by the hards, this was the climax of the song: \"He is invulnerable; his fetish no man can look upon, and bve.\" In the course of a war, the Ashantees use additional means to fortify themselves against evil, and to obtain fresh inspirations of vigour and courage. Several of the hearts of the slain enemy are taken out by the fetishmen who attend the army; and, having been cut to pieces, are mixed with blood and various consecrated herbs, while the accustomed ceremonies and incanta- tions are performed. Ab who have never before kibed an enemy, eat of the preparation ; it being bebeved, that if they did not, their energy would be secretly wasted by the haunting spirits of their deceased foes. The smaher joints, bones, and teeth of the most distinguished among the slain, are worn by the victors about their persons. It has abeady been shown, in the narrative of the war in which he fob, that such was the end of the unfortunate Sir Charles M'Carthy. His heart was eaten, and his bones were worn as fetishes or charms, by his savage conquerors. It serves to place in a strong light the character of the national deities, that, in ordinary or every day life, an individual as easby obtains their aid to injure his neighbours, as to avert erils from"], [240, "212 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. himself and his family. If a revengeful or mali cious design is formed, recourse is had to the fetish, for the purpose of carrying it into effect. During Mr. Hutchinson's stay at Coomassie, (Kumasi,) a person was executed for an attempt upon the bfe of bis brother, who was a caboceer, or nobleman. The criminal was presumptive heir to the property, and his object was to obtain possession of it, by the removal of his brother. To effect this, however, he did not use any personal violence, but only employed the fetish incantations which are resorted to for such pur poses. On another occasion, the keeper of the royal cemetery having been imprisoned for some offence, his wife was shortly after charged by the council with using fetish to turn the king's head. In her defence, she admitted that she had had recourse to fetish ; but abeged that she meant no more than to dispose the king to think better of her husband. If this was reaby her motive, she was only imitating the king himself; for he made fetish with the view that the heart of the king of England might be favourably disposed towards him; and to attain tins object, he sacrificed six men and nine women to his household gods. Her explanation, however, was not admitted. She was condemned for having invoked the fetish to make the king mad; and she paid"], [241, "213 CHAPTER VIII. the penalty of the alleged offence with her life. Such facts as these sufficiently explain the alarm which the Rev. Mr. Freeman's presence excited on one occasion. He had obtained per mission to visit Bantama, a smab town connected with the capital by a street, about a mile in length. This town is regarded as sacred, because it contains the fetish-house, which is the mauso leum of the kings of Ashantee (As-hanti). Euro peans are very rarely abowed to visit it ; and Mr. Freeman was informed, that he was the only white man who has been there during the reign of the present king. Even the inhabitants of Coomassie are prohibited from going there except when the king is present, who regularly visits the tombs of his ancestors every forty days. The conduct of Mr. Freeman, it appeared, was narrowly watched on the occasion ; for, after he had passed, on his return, under the magnificent banyan trees which grow in this place, three men, belonging to the chief of Bantama, ran after him, and requested him to stop. Mr. Freeman had looked atten tively at some beautiful parasite plants which grew upon one of the trees; his interpreter, moreover, had raised his hand, to protect his face from the twigs and leaves, as he passed beneath the trees in lbs palanquin ; and it was concluded, that some leaves had been plucked, by Mr."], [242, "214 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Freeman's direction, for the purpose of poisoning the king. The three men appeared satisfied with the explanations which Mr. Freeman offered; but immediately after he had got back to his quarters at Coomassie, (Kumasi,) he deemed it proper to communicate to Apdko what had happened, expressing at the same time his regret, that he had been the object of unworthy sus- picions. Now, as Mr. Freeman was regarded at Coo massie as a great fetishman, it was doubtless supposed that he intended to make a fetish pre paration of the leaves, for the purpose of effecting his supposed malevolent object, \u2014 the destruction of the king. It is not improbable, that one rea son why such dread is entertained of the fetish practices which are made to injure others is, that they are often followed by the death, or serious injury, of the individuals marked out thereby for destruction. Secret poisoning is practised exten sively among the Negroes of Guinea, as one of the most recent pubbcations on that part of Africa (Laird and Oldfield's Narrative) sufficiently shows; aud, by means of this fatal science, the fetishmen can effcctuaby ensure the success of their mystical preparations. The invocation of the aid of the fetish to kill or injure others, appears to be considered as a different offence from what is more strictly cabed"], [243, "215 CHAPTER VIII. witchcraft. If any one in angry contention with another is heard to wish he were dead, and that person shortly after dies or becomes seriously 01, the person who uttered the eril wish is accused of bewitching the sufferer. It is imagined, that when the wish is uttered, the eril spirit, or deril, goes out of the speaker, and, seizing upon the victim, inflicts upon him sickness and death. In such cases, the mischief is supposed to be pro duced not by the fetish, but by the deril. These offences are generally visited with severe punish ment. On one occasion, Wilham De Graft, and others who accompanied him, were instrumental in rescuing a poor old woman, whom they dis covered secretly confined in irons, and who most probably, but for their interference, would have lost her bfe on a charge of witchcraft. The practice of appealing to the fetishes by taking oaths is a striking feature of the national superstition. The common \"oath-draught,\" consisting of water poured into a brass pan, containing a bead, or some other material possessed of fetish influence, is administered on various occasions. Sometimes an individual is thereby sworn to maintain silence on a given subject; at other times, to teb ab he knows. During the Ga man or Buntuku war, the Ashantee (As-hanti) traders, before they set out from Coomassie,"], [244, "216 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. were laid under the obbgation of this oath, not to divulge anything which might be prejudicial to their sovereign, while they should remain at the settlements on the coast ; and, on their return to the capital, the oath was again administered to them for the purpose of binding them faith fully to report every circumstance of a pobtical character which had come within their knowledge whbe they were absent. It appears to be the usual practice, before any important negotiation is commenced, to adminis ter the oath to the linguists and interpreters, enjoining them, under tbe penalty of death, and the vengeance of the gods, to give a faithful interpretation of the words and sentiments of the speakers. In the negotiations between the Ashantees and the British, this was invariably attended to as a necessary prebminary to the commencement of the business ; and the bind ing character of the oath, and the dread which it inspires, may be inferred from the fact, that Dupuis's interpreters were so terrified at the thought of taking the oath-draught, that they urged him, by the most moving entreaties, to prevaO upon the king to exempt them from compbance. The oath is administered also at the con clusion of a negotiation, in ratification of engagements which have been entered into."], [245, "217 CHAPTER VIII, Wilham De Graft has heard his father state, that when the surrounding people deserted from the Ashantees, and joined the British under Sh\" Charles M'Carthy, the Fantee (Fanti) chiefs required them ab to drink the oath-draught, binding themselves utterly to renounce their allegiance to the king of Ashantee, and be faith ful to their new albes. Oaths are also administered to criminals on pubhc trials. In Ashantee (As-hanti) these are of various kinds. There are the oath by the king's foot; the oath by his father; and the oath \" by Acromanti and Saturday.\" The latter is the great oath of Ashantee, and originated in the calamitous death of Osai Tutu the Great. It has already been stated, that this monarch, and his principal ministers and officers, were sur prised and destroyed by a detachment of the enemy, as they were proceeding to join the Ashan tee army which had gone against Asin. Many of the enemy who made the fatal attack were natives of a town cabed Acromanti, and the whole detachment had been sheltered there dur ing the preceding night. The consequence was, that the town was doomed to utter destruction by the main body of the Ashantee army, and was burned to the ground; wlule ab the living creatures which it contained, men, women, cattle, and fowls, except such as were consc- L"], [246, "218 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. crated to the fetish, bled in expiation of the great offence. This work of extermination took place on a Saturday ; and, ever since, that day has been placed, in the calendar, in the bst of days stig matized by the Ashantees as days which forebode eril, and which are consequently . dedicated to expiatory and propitiatory sacrifices ; and no man wbl commence on Saturday the most trivial undertaking. From that tune also, the phrase which, in the native language, awakens the recol lection of \" Acromanti and Saturday,\" has been regarded as an oath of the most fearful import. The words themselves are deemed too sacred to be uttered, unless in a whisper between friends ; and this terrible oath is most commonly taken by inference only in the use of some such expres sion as, \"The dreadful day,\" or, \"The day of God's chastisement.\" Dupuis states that he has had the opportunity of observing at court, that the mere utterance of these expressions has instantly clouded every brow, and stamped the expression of woe on every countenance, from that of the king himself to that of the slave ; that some who were not men of influence at court, or who were involved in btigious palavers, and had especial cause to dread the royal dis pleasure, bave immediately rushed out ; and that others, who have remained, have covered their"], [247, "219 CHAPTER VIII. faces with both hands, uttering, at the same time, an invocation to the patron gods to protect them from the ominous import of those words, and the direful effects of the king's wrath or sorrow. The oath chiefly administered in criminal cases is Adum. The draught is an infusion of the bark of a tree, called by that name, in about half-a gabon of water. The person charged with crime is required to drink the nauseous mixture ; and it is bebeved, that if he be innocent, his stomach wib reject it, but if gubty, it wib not make him sick. But let the reader mark the principle which is here involved. It is supposed that the fetish goes down with the water into the man's stomach, and looks about in his heart for the gubt; that if he discovers the prisoner to be innocent, he comes back with the draught which is vomited up again ; hut that if he finds the alleged gubt, he remains in the stomach with the water to inflict upon the culprit the merited punishment. Bos man remarks that the draught, under the sup posed influence of the fetish, was expected to cause the criminal to burst, especiaby when the offender was a woman who had been required to take it as the test of her gubt or innocence on a charge of adultery. Has this custom originated in the Jewish law for trying suspected wives ? When the innocence of the accused has been l 2"], [248, "220 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. estabbshed by the vomiting up of the water, powdered chalk is put upon bis head, shoulders, breast, and back ; he is clothed in a white dress, and led round the town in triumph. In this procession, muskets are fired, and proclamation is made that the innocence of their friend, who was charged with crime, had been established by the fetish. To administer Adum is the most valued mode of trial. Witnesses may be cabed to substantiate the charge; but this is regarded as a tedious mode of proceeding. It is deemed better to make the prisoner drink Adum at once, because then the fetish himself goes into the man, and is sure to find out the truth ! The binding character of oaths, and the extent to which they are used, may be further proved by an occurrence which took place whfle Mr. Hut chinson was resident at Coomassie (Kumasi). One morning, a slave, belonging to the house-master, swore, by the king's head, that the king must kill him that day. A great uproar immediately ensued. Some put the man in irons, and others hastily brought out the family - stools ; fowls and sheep were sacrificed, and the blood was poured upon the stools to turn away the wrath of the king from the famOy ; and a formal notification was then made to the king of what had happened. The person who took the rash oath had been"], [249, "221 CHAPTER VIII. gubty of an offence, and apprehended that he should be put to the torture ; to avoid which, and to ensure speedy death, he swore that the king must shoot him with eight muskets. According to Ashantee (As-hanti) custom, the king was bound to perform the oath ; but he determined that the man should not have the benefit which he anti cipated from that mode of execution, and ordered that smab shot should be put into the musket so that he might not he kihed outright, but left to die a bngering death. As the oath, however, happened to be taken on the fetish-day of the king, he had it in his power to postpone the execution, and some weeks elapsed before it actually took place. This delay was the occasion of fresh troubles and alarms. One day, a nephew of the king cabed to see Mr. Hutchinson : but he was afraid to pass the man in irons, lest he should swear that, when the king kihed him, he must kib his own nephew also; and had the man sworn to that effect, the king would have been under obbgation to put him to death. To enable the prince to avoid the presence of the criminal, Mr. Hutchinson let him out of the house by a private door; and, on a subsequent day, he afforded the same friendly pririlege to Apdko, who had cabed upon him for some medicine ; and who also dreaded a sight of the man in irons."], [250, "222 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. At length, as the king resolved to reserve the criminal for execution at the Adai custom, he was removed to a more retired place of con finement, as very few persons of rank dared to visit Mr. Hutchinson so long as he remained upon the premises. One of the revolting barbarities inflicted upon human victims, previously to their being sacri ficed, results from the dread which is entertained of oaths. In the descriptions which have been given of the great Ashantee festivals, the vic tims are represented as appearing in the proces sion with knives thrust through their cheeks and lips; and this is a precaution to prevent them from uttering rash oaths. When a person is selected for execution, he is suddenly thrown down, and his mouth is at once skewered up with a knife to hinder him from swearing the death of any person or persons whom he might be disposed to mark out for destruction."], [251, "CHAPTER IX.

The great Rebgious Customs, which are to be classed among the darkest features of the national superstition, yet remabi for consideration. The immolation of prisoners taken in war is one of those revolting practices; for it is presented to our notice, not as the effect of the ungovernable passions of the conquerors, breaking loose from"], [252, "224 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. the restraints and obbgations of rebgion, but as an expression of pious zeal and devotion. It results from the principle recognised by the king of Ash antee, (As-hanti,) in a conversation to which refer ence has been previously made : that \" the fetish makes war for strong men, because they can then pay plenty of gold, and proper sacrifice.\" To obtain a supply of victims for their altars, is thus a principal end for which the national deities are supposed to promote war ; and the sacrifice of their prisoners consequently becomes a rebgious obbgation on the part of the people. Dreadful are the scenes of barbarity which are exhibited after a victorious campaign. After the Gaman war, sub two thousand prisoners were destroyed, by the most refined tortures, over the royal death stool in Coomassie, (Kumasi,) in honour of the fetish, and of the shades of departed kings and heroes ; and at the commencement of the war winch brought the Ashantees into hostbe collision with the British, when the Asins were overthrown near the Prah, the horrid work of sacrificing the prisoners went on at the bttle temple on the banks of the river, by night as web as by day, until thousands had perished. In the national songs which celebrated the latter victory, the principle winch requires the sacrifice of prisoners was distinctly recognised; and the bards exultingly sang that \" a river of perjured blood flowed from"], [253, "225 CHAPTER IX. Miasa to the Prah, and propitiated the wrath of the river-god.\" The customs for the dead may be prefaced by an account of the practices which are resorted to on the birth of chddren ; for the purpose of connecting, in one view, the influences which superstition exerts upon the Negro, from his entrance into the world to the time of his leaving it. In some places, as soon as a chdd is born, the fetishman is sent for, who hinds certain fetish preparations around his limbs, using, at the same time, a form of incantation or prayer. This is done to fortify the infaiit against ab kinds of eril. Circumcision is practised by some people ; but if inquiry is made respecting the origin or design of the custom, they are unable to assign any other reason for it, than that it has come down to them from then* ancestors. In Fantee, (Fanti,) the chdd usuaby receives his name at the time prescribed by the Levitical law for the practice of circumcision. On the eighth day after the birth, the father of the chbd, accompanied by a number of friends, proceeds to the house of the mother. If he be a rich man, he takes with him a gabon of ardent spirits, to be used on the festive occasion. On arriving at the house, the friends form a circle around the father, who delivers a kind of address, in which he acknowledges the kindness of the gods for giving l 5"], [254, "226 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. to him the chdd, and cabs upon those present also to thank the fetishes on his account. Then, taking the chdd in his arms, he squirts upon him from his mouth a bttle of the ardent spirits, and pronounces the name by which he is to be cabed, \u2014 usually the name of some relative or friend, \u2014 at the same time offering a prayer that he may bve to be old, and become a stay and support to the famby, and may have the protection of the departed spirit of him after whom he is named ; or, if the friend be stih bring, that he may prove worthy of the name winch has been given to him ; upon which, the friend referred to advances towards his infant name-sake, and hangs round his neck a trinket of gold, or a valuable bead ; and continues afterwards to manifest a peculiar inter est in the chdd, by sending him occasional pre sents, and showing him other special attentions. A second name which the chdd usually takes, is that of the day of the week on which he was born. The fobowing are the names of the days in the Fantee (Fanti) language, varied in then orthography according to the sex of the chdd : \u2014 MALES. FEMALES.

It is frequently the case that chddren are speciaby devoted to the service of the fetish before they are born ; and even death is not an immediate debverance from fetish practices and ceremonies. When a native departs this life, inquiry is instituted as to the cause of his decease, and particularly if it were somewhat sudden and unbooked for. To ascertain this point, the dead person is himself biterrogated. According to Bosman, persons are appointed to take the corpse upon their shoulders, when the priest enumerates the supposed causes of his death, and requires to know which was the real one; it being bebeved, that when that is men tioned, the persons supporting the corpse wbl be constrained, by some secret power, to bend forwards towards the priest. The object of this examination is not to ascertain whether the individual has died of natural disease, and what was the malady ; but whether he has not been poisoned by the secret practices of some one ; or whether his friends have not neglected, during his ibness, to make suitable offerings to the fetish for his recovery; or whether he himself had not been gubty of neglect of his duty to the fetish. The answer obtained is always that which is best calculated to promote the designs of the priest, or to further the plans which he had previously arranged with some of the friends of the deceased."], [256, "228 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Such serious palavers, however, frequently resulted from these post-mortem interrogations, that the British authorities have endeavoured to discoun tenance them among those of the natives who, since the Ashantee war, have been led to depend upon England for protection. In Fantee (Fanti) the preparations for a funeral commence by washing the corpse, array ing the dead person in his best garments, and adorning him -with his trinkets and beads. He is then laid on a sofa, in a room, the walls of which are covered, either whoby or in part, with red cloth. A silk umbreba is fastened to the wall over the head of the corpse, and a table is placed near it, covered with viands and wine for the use of the departed spirit. The famfly then com mence a loud wading, which attracts the neigh bours to the house, and the females generaby join in the lamentation. Every party of relatives or friends coming from a distance to join in the Custom, bring a suitable present, and arc accompanied with drums and muskets. On their arrival, they give their presents to the individual having the charge or direction of the funeral, who is usually one of the principal persons of the famby of the deceased. They then fire their muskets, and begin to beat their drums. The director of the funeral custom takes a regular account of the presents"], [257, "229 CHAPTER IX. received, in order that a similar compliment may be returned, when the head of the family of the donors may be removed by death. After a few days, the dead person is buried in his own house, or, if he be a young man, in the house of his father. And on the principle that individuals assume, in another world, the state which they maintained in this, the head of a family is interred in bis best clothes and orna ments; gold-dust is also put into his grave; and sheep and cattle, at least, are slain on the occasion. Drumming, firing, dancing, waibngs, shoutings, and other extravagant proceedings, take place when the sob is thrown upon the corpse ; and food and drink are placed upon the grave. If the deceased was rich, the Custom is con tinued, perhaps for a month, until the family are nearly reduced to want ; as they are obliged to support ab the parties who attended the funeral from a distance, so long as they remain. A funeral is usuaby absolute ruin to a poor famby. Whether they can afford it or not, the Custom must be observed ; and the survivors are obbged to find money to meet the expenses. The practice of persons borrowing money of others, and engaging to remunerate the lender by their future services, (a practice which cannot be regarded without suspicion, as babie to great"], [258, "230 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. abuse,) is very much promoted by funeral-cus toms. Many poor persons, on the death of the head of then- famby, have been obbged to become \"pawns\" to others, in order to obtain sufficient money to meet the unavoidable expense. The funeral-custom is renewed at the end of twelve months, when sheep and cattle are kihed in honour of the deceased. Every year, after this, a bttle rum and food is placed upon the grave by the relatives ; and even if the house has gone to decay, or has been puhed down, they wib not fab to repair to the spot with the accustomed annual offering. Up to a comparatively late period, human sacrifices were pubbcly offered at funeral-customs in the immediate neighbourhood of the coast. Bosman mentions one at which he himself wit- nessed eleven persons put to death ; among whom was an individual who, having endured exquisite torture, was then debvered up to a chbd of six years of age, by whom his head was, after much difficulty, finally sawed from bis body. Mere- dith states, that, in the year 1800, when a king of Apobonia died, one or two human beings were sacrificed every Saturday, untb the great- custom took place, which did not happen untb six months after his decease ; when upwards of fifty persons were sacrificed, and two of his youngest wives were put alive with his corpse into the"], [259, "231 CHAPTER IX. grave, wherein was deposited a considerable quan tity of gold, and several rich cloths. The bd of the coffin was covered with human blood, on which gold-dust was sprinkled. And Dupuis says that he himself has known many unhappy victims sacrificed in the last few years, within gun-shot of the castles. He mentions expressly the case of two men and two women, who were butchered, with the greatest barbarity, under the very wabs of the fort at Accra ; and adds, that at Tantum, Apobonia, Dix Cove, Succondee, ancl Chamah, the same class of murders was perpe trated with impunity. In a recent letter the Rev. Mr. Brooking mentions, that a person had just perished under the sacrificial knife at Dutch Accra. Since the Ashantee invasions, the power of the Fantees has been so greatly broken, and their numbers are so much reduced, that the British government, to which they are obbged to look for protection, has been enabled to put down these inhuman practices within the sphere of its immediate influence. In the independent States in the interior, the funeral-customs of the rich and great exhibit spectacles of the most horrifying barbarity. In some cases many of the wives, and in others a great number of slaves, are, on these occasions, sent after the deceased, to enable him to maintain his proper rank in another world. At the instant"], [260, "232 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. when a king of Dahomy dies, a dreadful scene takes place in the palace. The wives of the deceased monarch begin to break and destroy his ornaments, and everything valuable belong ing to themselves, and then to kib each other. When Adahunzun died, two hundred and eighty of his wives thus perished, before his successor could arrive at the palace and put a stop to the carnage; and, at the funeral of the deceased king, ab these victims were buried in the same grave, with six of the remaining bring wives. In Ashantee, (As-hanti,) when a person of dis tinction dies, the slaves immediately rush out of the house, to hide themselves in the bush ; as a slave or two are instantly sacrificed in order to attend upon the spirit of the deceased until the custom shah take place. It has been stated, that the king of Ashantee, in his last battle with the British at Dodowah, whenever it was announced to him that any of his captains had been kihed, immediately caused slaves to be immo lated to accompany them into the other world. When Mr. Bowdich was at Coomassie, (Ku masi,) he had the opportunity of witnessing a funeral-custom for the mother of one of the principal caboceers ; and he states, that, as soon as she had breathed her last, the king, her son, and another of the nobles, each sacrificed a young girl, that the deceased might not be alto-"], [261, "233 CHAPTER IX. gether without attendants, until the Custom should take place. The relatives and adherents of the famdy then presented contributions of gold, powder, rum, and cloth, to be expended at the funeral; but the king, as the hen* of ab his subjects, sent a larger present than any other, except the nearest relative who succeeded to the stool and the slaves. He also sent a sum of gold, and some valuable cloths, to be buried with the deceased. On the day of the funeral, an extraordinary scene presented itself. Walking out about noon, Mr. Bowdich and his friends saw the vultures hoveling over two headless trunks, scarcely cold ; and were passed by several troops of women, from fifty to a hundred each, who danced along in a movement resembling skaiting, lauding and bewabing the deceased in the most dismal strains. Other women carried on their heads rich cloths aud silks, and other valuables which had belonged to her. All these women were profusely daubed with red earth, in barbarous imitation of those who had succeeded in besmearing themselves with the blood of the victims. The rush of the crowd was most tumultuous; and the noise of the horns, drums, and muskets, with the yells, groans, and screechings, which were heard in every direction, produced a stunning effect. Now and then a victim was hurried along"], [262, "234 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. at sub speed, by persons, the savage dehght of whose countenances gave them a fiend-like appearance; and the chiefs and captains arrived in rapid succession, then\" approach being an nounced by the peculiar flourishes of their horns, and the firing of muskets. Presently the king's arrival in the market-place was made known ; and the crowd rolled impetuously towards it; but the sabres of the soldiers, which were freely used, hewed a way for the procession. The son of the deceased led the van, dancing from side to side bke a bacchanal, and appearing as though he was intoxicated with the adulatory praises which were bebowed forth by his attendants. He looked upon the victims, who had large knives passed through their cheeks, with a savage joy, bordering on frenzy; whbe they regarded him with indifference or apathy. The other chiefs and captains, adorned in all the splendour of their fetish dresses, fobowed bi the train. On arriving at the market-place, the king was seen seated with his usual attendants and state display. Thirteen victims, surrounded by then executioners, in black shaggy caps and vests, were pressed together by the crowd at his left hand. The troops of women already described, paraded on the outside of the circle, voci ferating the dirge, and the utmost powers of the horns and drums were called forth. A discharge"], [263, "CHAPTER IX. 235 of musketry then took place near the king, which spread round the circle, and was continued with out intermission for an hour. The soldiers kept then stations; but the chiefs, after firing their muskets, bounded once round the area with the gesture and extravagant behaviour of maniacs, fobowed by their sycophants, who waved flags over their heads and roared forth their \" strong names.\" The head fetishwoman of the famfly was at the same time observed rushing through the ranks as the muskets were fired, and scream ing as though in the greatest agonies. The firing having somewhat subsided, rum and palm wine were copiously drunk; and the principal females of the famfly, many of whom were described as being very handsome, and of elegant figures, came forward to dance. A present of sheep and rum having been exchanged between the king and the son of the deceased, the drums announced the sacrifice of the victims, who were visited by ab the chiefs in turn. The executioners struggled with each other for the bloody office, the victims looking on, meanwhbe, with marvebous apathy. At length an executioner, snatching a sword, lopped off the right hand of one of the victims, who was then thrown down and had his head sawed, rather than cut, from the body. The remaining twelve were, in bke manner, mangled and butchered"], [264, "236 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. upon the spot; and others, principaby females were provided, to be sacrificed in the bush where the body was interred. Slaves, however, are not the only victims on such occasions ; for it is usual to \"wet the grave\" with the blood of at least one respectable freeman. The heads of ab the slaves who have perished having been placed in the grave, several of the retainers of the family are cabed in a hurry to assist in lowering the coffin; when, just as it touches the heads which pave the bottom of the grave, one of the free men is stunned by a violent blow, a deep gash is cut in the back part of his neck, he is rolled in upon the body, and the grave is instantly fibed up. After this, the firing, drinking, singing, and dancing were kept up during several days; and it was understood that, had not the approach ing war with Gaman enforced the necessity of economizing powder, there would have been eight Great Customs for the deceased, instead of this one; at the last of which the king him self would have fired. On the last day of the Custom, ab the females connected with the family paraded round the town, singing a kind of grate ful acknowledgment of the services of those who had assisted at the Custom. The funeral-customs for kings and members of the royal famby are conducted on a scale cor-"], [265, "237 CHAPTER IX. responding with the rank of the deceased. The okras, who are slaves peculiarly devoted to the king, and distinguished by a large circle of gold suspended from the neck, amounting in number to more than a hundred, are always sacrificed, with many women, on the tomb of the king. When Osai Quamina died, the funeral-custom was repeated every week for three months, two hundred slaves being sacrificed, and twenty-five barrels of powder being fired on each occasion ; but when the king's brother died, during the invasion of Fantee, the king devoted three thou sand victims, two thousand of whom were Fantee prisoners, and nearly one thousand more were furnished by various towns; making, in the whole, about four thousand human beings who perished at the grave of this royal personage. When the king dies, Ashantee is, in fact, one vast Aceldama; for ab the customs which have been made for deceased subjects during his reign, must be repeated by their fambies, simultaneously with the custom which is celebrated, in ab the excess of extravagance and barbarity, for the departed monarch himself During the first two or three days after the death of the king, scarcely any one is safe; for the relatives of the king, bursting forth with their muskets, carry havock and death around ; and few persons, even of the highest rank, dare, for a time, to stir from"], [266, "238 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. their houses. The funeral-customs of the kings of Ashantee are frequently repeated; and Ban tama, the royal sepulchre, is ever and anon made to reek with the blood of newly-slain victims. The annual Yam-Custom furnishes another exhi bition of the true character of the national super stitions. This festival is celebrated about the end of the month of August, or the beginning of Sep tember, when the yam is ready for use ; aud the feast is intended as a pubbe acknowledgment, on the part of the people, of the kindness of the fetishes in preserving them through another year, and permitting them to see the new yam. In Fantee, (Fanti,) ab the inhabitants of the towns assemble under the shade of the grove adjoining the fetish-house or temple ; when a sheep or a number of fowls are kflled; part of the flesh of which is mixed with boded yams and palm-oil, and a portion of this mixture being placed upon the heads of the images, the remainder is thrown about before the temple, as a heave-offering to the deities. When the heave offering has been presented, the fetishmen receive from the people the offerings of rum which they have brought ; and, after placing a bttle upon the heads of the images, and pouring out a smab quan tity upon the ground before the temple, they invite all the fetishes to come and partake of it, say ing, \" When people eat, they need to drink also.\""], [267, "239 CHAPTER IX. In this invitation, ab the fetishes of the place are mentioned by name, which, as in the case of Cape-Coast town, where there are seventy-seven guardian- deities, is sometimes a tedious enumera tion. And it is worthy of special remark, that the name of Yankumpon is, occasionally at least, placed at the head of the bst. The remainder of the sheep and fowls, not used in the offering to the fetishes, is made into a kind of soup, of which no persons but the priests and priestesses are allowed to eat ; but the people also partake of the residue of the rum. When the priests have finished their repast, the people begin to beat the drums, and sing fetish songs, to which the priests dance ; and the festivity is often prolonged throughout the night. The celebration of the Yam-Custom at Win nebah is attended with one peculiarity. The principal fetish at that place, it is bebeved, wib not be satisfied with sheep, but he must have a deer brought abve to bis temple, and there sacrificed. Accordingly, on the appointed day, every year, when the Custom is to be cele brated, almost the whole of the inhabitants, except the aged and infirm, go out into the adjoining countiy, which, studded with clumps of trees and bushes, has a park-like appearance ; and, whbe the women and chddren look on, the men proceed to strike the thicket with sticks, at"], [268, "240 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. the same time beating drums, and hahooing with ab their might. Whbe thus engaged, sometimes a leopard or panther starts forth ; but it is usuaby so frightened with the noise and confusion, that it scampers off in one direction as fast as the people run from it in another. When a deer bursts out, the chace begins, and the people attempt to run it down. At length it is perhaps tumbled upon the ground, by the sticks which are thrown at its legs, when the people seize it, and exultingly carry it off to the town, with shouting and drum ming. On entering, they are met by the aged persons with staves; and, having gone in pro cession round the town, they proceed to the fetish-house, where the animal is sacrificed, and partly offered to the fetish, and partly eaten by the priests. The catching of the deer is described as an animated scene ; and European gentlemen not unfrequently go from Annamaboe (Anamabii) to witness it. In 1839, the people succeeded in catching two deer, which were both offered to the fetish. The annual Yam-Custom is continued during several days; and is fobowed or closed by what the Engbsh have termed the \" Black-Christmas,\" when the people put on their best clothes, and visit each other. On entering the house, they shake hands with ab the inmates, congratulating them, and wishing they may bve to see another"], [269, "CHAPTER IX. 241 year. On this occasion, the chiefs bring out their large umbrehas, and ab make the best display which their circumstances wib afford. In about three weeks after this, the ceremony of turning the deril out of the towns takes place, and the people conclude that they have then made a promising commencement of the year. At the time of the Yam-Custom in Ashantee, (As-hanti,) there is a great national assembly in the capital. Ab the caboceers, and the tributary sovereigns, or their representatives, are required to be present, except those who have been sent to a distance on urgent pubbe business; and it is at this annual festival that suspected chiefs are usuaby placed upon their trial. During the whole of the festival, the greatest beentiousness and immorality prevail, and both sexes abandon themselves to their passions without restraint. At a Yam-Custom which Mr. Bowdich saw, there was a display of the same barbarous splendour which is witnessed on ab state-occa sions; and this was made on the largest possi ble scale, seeing that there was present a ftdl representation of ab the power and wealth of the empire. Spectacles the most appalling were also exhibited on the occasion. Every caboceer, as he arrived, sacrificed a slave at the gate of the capital by which he entered; and, in the procession of the first day, ab the heads of the kings and H"], [270, "242 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. caboceers who had been conquered, from the reign of Osai Tutu down to that time, with those who had been executed for rebebion, were carried by two parties of executioners, each consisting of upwards of a hundred individuals. In the skubs were inserted sprigs of thyme, to prevent the spirits of the deceased from troubling the king ; and as the bearers of those horrid trophies passed along in an impassioned dance, they clashed their knives upon the skubs either with the most frightful gestures, or with an expression of inde scribable irony and ridicule. The festivity was kept up during the greater part of the night ; and on the fobowing morning, which happened to be the Christian sabbath, the king ordered a large quan tity of rum to be poured into brass pans, for the use of the people, in various parts of the town. A most beastly scene resulted; for, in less than an hour, excepting the principal men, not a sober individual was to be seen. Towards the evening, another splendid procession took place. The third day was chiefly occupied with state-palavers ; and on the day after, (Tuesday,) the assembly broke up, and the caboceers took their leave. In the course of these proceedings, about one hundred persons were kihed at various places in the capital. Several slaves were also sacrificed at the royal, sepulchre of Bantama, over the enormous brass pan which is used there for"], [271, "243 CHAPTER IX. sacrificial purposes; and the streaming blood of the victims was mingled with various vegetable and animal matter, partly fresh and partly putre fied, for the purpose of making the most power fid fetish. All the chiefs, likewise, kihed several slaves, and caused their blood to flow into the holes from which the new yams were taken ; and those who could not afford to kib slaves, took the head of one already sacrificed, and placed it upon the hole. In about ten days after the Custom, the king attends in the market-place, and the whole of the royal household eat new yams for the first time. On the day after, the king and his principal cap tains, fobowed by almost ab the inhabitants of the capital, set out early, for Sarasu, to perform their annual ablutions in the river Dah. The king is attended by his suite at the river; but he laves the water with his hands over his own person, his chafrs, stools, gold and sbver plate, and the various articles of furniture used especiaby by himself. One sheep and one goat are sacrificed at the time ; and several brass pans, with various fetish preparations under them, are placed on the ground, covered with white cloth. Twenty sheep are also dipped in the water, and reserved to be sacrificed on the return to the palace. Their blood is poured upon the door-posts and the stools ; and ab the doors, windows, and arcades of the palace, m 2"], [272, "244 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. as well as the stools of the several tribes and fami lies, are profusely besmeared with a mixture of eggs and palm-od. On entering the palace, the fetishmen walk first, with attendants, carrying basins of sacred water, into which they dip branches of trees, and sprinkle the water over the chiefs and principal persons, some of whom run to have a bttle poured upon their heads, and also upon their tongues. The king and ab his attendants wear white clothes on the occasion; and three white lambs are led before him, intended to be sacrificed at his bed-chamber.. It has already been shown, that, in the interior, time is divided into periods of three weeks, and that the first of the three is regarded as the good week, and is cabed Adai. The Ashantees honour its return by a rebgious festival, termed \"the Adai-Custom ;\" and this is distinguished again as \" great \" or \" bttle,\" for reasons which have not been fuby ascertained. The great and the bttle Customs, however, appear to alternate with regu larity, so that one of each is celebrated every three weeks. At the setting of the sun on the evening previous to the Custom, the great death drum, which stands at the gate of the palace, is struck with much force; on hearing which signal, ab the persons connected with the royal household shout, and then\" exclamations are"], [273, "245 CHAPTER IX. echoed by the people throughout the capital. Music and firing are continued through the night ; and on the next morning, the king proceeds to the fetish-house, opposite to the palace, and offers in sacrifice several sheep, whose blood is poured on the golden stool, which is regarded as the palla dium of the kingdom. There is then a numerous assemblage of ab ranks in the palace-yard. A great display takes place ; and it has been calcu lated, that the king, on every such occasion, makes presents to the superior captains and others, amounting in value to the sum of four hundred pounds sterling. This Custom, also, is frequently accompanied by scenes most revolting to humanity. Mr. Hutchinson remarks, that the greatest sacrifice of human life which took place whfle he resided at Coomassie, (Kumasi,) occurred on the eve of the bttle Adai-Custom. He had a friendly caution given him respecting it, from a quarter winch he did not feel himself at bberty to name. \" Chris tian,\" said his kind monitor, \" take care and watch over your famfly : the angel of death has drawn his sword, and wfll strike on the neck of many Ashantees. When the drum is struck on Adai-eve, it wbl be the death-signal of many. Shun the king if you can, but fear not.\" As the time approached to beat the drum, and Mr. Hutehinson sat meditating on the horrors of the"], [274, "246 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. ensuing night, he suddenly received a message to attend the king. This was a somewhat startling summons, as obnoxious caboceers are frequently thus sent for on such occasions, ostensibly to talk a palaver, but, on entering the palace, they are seized and led to execution. Mr. Hutchinson, however, waited upon the king; and, whfle he remained with him, the officers appointed to attend the sacrifices came in with then\" knives, and other weapons of destruction. The design of this sacrifice was, to propitiate the fetish, and secure its assistance in the ap proaching war with Buntuku. The bones of the king's mother and sisters were, in the first place, taken out of their coffins, and bathed in rum and water; and after having been wiped with silks, they were rolled in gold-dust, and wrapped in strings of rock-gold, aggry beads, and other most costly materials. Those against whom the lung had any cause of complaint, were then sent for in succession, and immolated as they entered, in order that \" their blood might water the graves \" of the royal personages, whose bones had been exhumed. During the whole of the night, the king's executioners traversed the city, and ab whom they met were dragged away for execution ; but the intended massacre having by some means become known, the king was disappointed in securing many of the most distinguished indivi-"], [275, "247 CHAPTER IX. duals, who had been marked out as victims. Next morning desolation seemed to reign over the capital, and no persons appeared in the market place, but the king and his attendants. When the day closed, the human sacrifices were again renewed ; and during the night, the bones of the. royal deceased were removed to the sacred tomb at Bantama, accompanied by a splendid proces sion. The chiefs and their attendants were all habited in their military costume ; the stools, and ab the ornaments used on great occasions, were borne by the proper officers ; the human rictbnsy in chains, with their hands tied behind them, pre ceded the bones; whOe at intervals, the chant ing of the war-song indicated the eagerness which pr evaded to march against the enemy. When the procession returned, on the fobowing day, the king proceeded to the market-place ; his horns sounded the web-known \"wow, wow, wow,\" interpreted, \" death, death, death ; \" and the work of sacrifice was at once resumed. The king sat with a goblet of palm-wine in his hand, and every time the executioners cut off a head, he imitated a dancing motion in his chair. The terrors of the day ended when the king returned to his palace ; and the chiefs, issuing from their places of concealment, paraded the streets, rejoicing that they had, for that time, escaped death."], [276, "248 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. A similar description is given of the bttle Adai- Custom, by Dupuis. The city, he remarks, exhi bited tbe most deplorable sobtude ; and the few human beings who were courageous enough to* show themselves in the streets, fled at the approach of a captain, and barricadoed their doors, to avoid being shot, or dragged to sacrifice. The doleful cries of the women vibrated from* various parts of the city ; and the death-horns and drums seemed to stupify the obnoxious prisoners and foreign slaves with terror, as clearly indi cating the dangers to which they were exposed. It is a curious fact, that a number of elderly Negroes in Jamaica, when they heard the journal of the Rev. Mr. Freeman read to them by a Mis sionary, immediately recognised the names of places at which they had formerly been, and appeared to retain a most vivid recobection of the fear-inspiring sound of the great death-drum at Coomassie. The second day of the Custom exhi bited a similar train of horrors ; and human blood again flowed in torrents, at the dictate of this san guinary superstition. It would be an easy task to enlarge this horri fying picture. The rebgious customs of the neighbouring country of Dahomy, whose bar barous monarch paves the approaches to his resi dence, and ornaments the battlements of his palace, with the skubs of his victims, \u2014 and tho"], [277, "CHAPTER IX. 249 gigantic fetish-tree at Badagry, the wide-spread- ing branches of which are laden with human carcases and limbs, \u2014 would alone furnish abun- dant matter for amplification. But further re- search is unnecessary. The reader wib now be able to form a tolerably correct estimate of the nature and tendency of the popular superstition. The range of its influence, it is seen, is almost without bmit. It holds its votaries in a state of perpetual thraldom. They cannot eat or drink without recognising its authority. They cannot cultivate then\" ground, undertake a jour- ney, enter into any negotiation, or engage in any business, but in obedience to its requirements. And both the practice of medicine, and the admi- nistration of justice, being under its control, it regulates the proceedings in ab questions affecting property, and life, and health. The baneful effect which such a system must have upon pubbe morals, especiaby demands attention. What, indeed, must be the morals of a people where unchastity in unmarried women is no disgrace ; where prostitution is even regarded as a virtue ; where the priesthood is employed in promoting and concealing the intrigues of faithless wives ; and where rebgion sanctions instead of discountenancing crime, and even lends the aid of its influence to him who cherishes injurious intentions against the property and life m 5"], [278, "250 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. of another ! Bosman, an accurate observer of men and things, remarks that \" murder, adultery, thieving, and ab other such-bke crimes, are here accounted no sins.\" And Meredith, whose testi mony and opinion are equaby deserving of respect, says, \" The rebgious system of the natives has no tendency whatever to improve their morality. It consists almost entirely in a superstitious dread of suffering from some mabgn influence, and in the faith they repose in the fetishes or charms which are furnished by the fetishmen, or priests, for the purpose of warding off the dreaded eril.\" This is a correct view of the case. The practical religion of the people does not consist in the exercise of the moral virtues, but in a careful performance of fetish practices and ceremonies. According as a person attends to or neglects these, he is regarded either as a good or a bad man; and it fobows, that so far as the natives refrain from the grossest acts of immorality, they are influenced by other motives than those which their rebgion furnishes. A careful examination of the national rebgion unfolds the true source of the barbarous prac tices which so extensively prevab. Was nothing known of the superstitions of the people, it might remain a matter of doubt, whether in the whole sale butcheiy of their enemies, they were not merely indulging their own savage instincts, bke"], [279, "251 CHAPTER IX. the wbd beasts of the forest. In the absence of information on that subject, the interpretation of the fohowing passages from Dupuis would be attended with difficulty. \" The wars of the king,\" says the writer, \" were shortly after introduced as a subject of general discussion. That of Gaman was the favourite subject ; and the king occasionahy took up the thread of the narrative, or elucidated such events as were perhaps not generaby known. As he caused the linguists to interpret to me the particular feats of himself, the king of Banna, and Apoko, his eyes sparkled with fiery animation; and at one period, he threw himself into a sort of theatrical attitude, which appeared to be unpre meditated and unaffected. He then seemed to be wrapped up within himself in debghtful cogi tations; and at this crisis, some of the auditors, like the bards of olden time, rose to the hum of the war-song, and recited their parts in a pleasing mellifluous strain. The king enjoyed the scene in ecstasy, and frequently motioned with his body and feet, in cadence with the metre of the verse. This reverie and the recitation occupied many minutes, and were ultimately succeeded by irony and satire cast upon the memory of his faben enemy. 'His skub was broken,' said the king, 'but I would not lose the trophy, and now I have made a simflar skub of gold. This is for"], [280, "252 ASHANTEE ANn THE GOLD COAST. my great Customs, that ab the people may know I am the king.' \"A slave was deputed to one of the apart ments of the palace ; and as he returned, he depo sited a chair which, His Majesty said, was the regal seat of Dinkara. This piece of workman ship was studded ab over with gold and sflver* ornaments, and sflver coin of different European States. The slave again disappeared, and re turned, bringing under his escort a son of that unfortunate monarch, one of the few male sur vivors of the race of Dinkara. A pallid hue, if so it may be termed, overspread the jetty features of the youth, as he bowed trembling before the king. The angry glance which marked his reception excited the most painful apprehensions, and the countenance of the young man spoke woful agony, as he endeavoured to scan the purport of the summons. \" ' Your father,' said the king, addressing him self to the prince, 'was a rebel; he was sub of pride, and wanted to be a great king ; he forgot when he was my slave. Is not this true ? Then he wanted Sarem to help him, and sent gold to make friends. Is not that true, too ? He forgot I was his master; he kihed my sword-bearers, and sent me an insulting message. Now I have his skub, and the jaw-bones of his captains. His wives, and you, and ab the people, are my slaves ;"], [281, "253 CHAPTER IX. and when I teb you to die, you shall die as your brother did ; but now you shall serve me.' \"The king then desired him to strip off his robe, and show me the wounds he had received in battle. The unhappy youth did as he was' instructed, pointing to five or six honourable scars upon his breast, arms, and thighs, which had the1 appearance of gun-shot wounds. ' Now,' said the king to him, with a stern, sarcastic apathy, ' you know your father was a fool, and that I am' the king ; you did not know that before ; and so now go home untb I send for you again.' \" It is added that this unfortunate youth had been compebed, in the presence of the king, to join a chorus in the cruel epicedium, or \" death song,\" which preceded his brother's sacrifice : \u2014 ' an execution which was performed in his presence, with torture, and amidst the mockery and deri sion of the whole court. The inquiry naturally arises, On what principle could such a character as that described in the preceding quotations be formed? What had produced the feeling which, from its settledness and malignity, indicated the demon rather than the man, and made the monarch appear as the very personification of infernal revenge ? Was he remarkable for his natural ferocity and savageness of disposition? The reverse was the case. He was pobte and affable in his general"], [282, "254 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. manners; and especially characterized by his tender and affectionate treatment of his chddren. To his religion this fearful trait in his character must be traced. That taught him to regard his captive as an implacable foe, who would carry his enmity beyond the grave, and of whom, as an eril spirit, even after death he would have to beware. That instructed him, moreover, to be beve that the torture and sacrifice of an enemy are peculiarly acceptable to the deities whom he worshipped. \" A Negro,\" says Dupuis, \" can hardly be persuaded that an enemy might be converted into a friend ; and, as he naturahy thirsts after his gold, if he is so far successful, nothing can satiate him short of his opponent's blood, which is esteemed the portion of the spoO due to the tutelar gods, (and accept able to the shades of his ancestors,) whose service it is incumbent on him not to neglect, lest their wrath should overwhelm him on a future day.\" This solves the difficulty, and shows on what prin ciple the most diabobcal revenge is sometimes combined in the same individual with great natural affection. When once it is ascertained that a people are thoroughly bnbued with the persuasion, that the deities, whom they regard as the arbiters of their own fate, require human sacrifices as the most acceptable offerings which their votaries can possibly present; that those"], [283, "255 CHAPTER IX. deities, in fact, employ themselves in promoting and fomenting war, in order that their altars may continuaby reek with blood; \u2014 when once it is found that such a persuasion is the governing principle, the dreadful scenes which occur in Ashantee (As-hanti) cease to create surprise, as it is evident that such practices must naturahy result from such deep-rooted and prevalent principles. The popular superstition, it is moreover evident, gives an intensity of expression even to those fea tures in the social state of the Ashantees and their neighbours which it may not have originated. To whatever cause domestic slavery and polygamy may be traced, rebgion has laid hold of both institutions, and stamped them with its sanction.

One of the youths, of the name of Quaque, was afterwards sent to the University of Oxford, and having completed his education there, he received ordination, and returned to exercise the Christian ministry in his native country. He was chaplain at Cape-Coast Castle for more than fifty years; but does not appear to have been instrumental in turning any of his countrymen to Christianity.

It yields no support to the plausible theory of Christianizing Pagan lands, primarily or chiefly, by bringbig natives to this country for educa tion with a view to their becoming the prin- cipal instructors of their countrymen ; and shows that if, on their return, they are left to their own resources, it is more likely that they wib sink down again to the level of their former state than that they wib prove the regenerators of their country.

Some Engbsh chaplains, who were sent after the decease of Quaque, successively died soon after then\" arrival at Cape-Coast Castle. About ten years since, a mission was com menced by the Basle Missionary Society at Danish Accra, (Akrah,) and in the adjoining country of Aquapim ; but this truly phdanthropic undertaking does not .appear to have been attended with the desired success. The Mis sionaries encountered opposition in quarters where they ought to have received encou ragement and support; several of them were removed by death ; and the last survivor of their number, the Rev. Mr. Rbs, returned to Europe for the benefit of his health, in the same ship by which the Rev. Mr. Freeman came on a visit to England in the spring of last year. It was in the autumn of the year 1834, that the Committee of the Wesleyan Missionary Society were induced to send a Missionary on a visit of observation to the Gold Coast.

He was surprised at receiving such an appli cation from a native young man, and became so greatly interested by the information which his questions ebcited, that he was led to ask whe ther the instructions of a Missionary would not be highly appreciated by those native inquirers after the true rebgion. De Graft repbed in the affirmative, but appeared doubtful whether so high a pririlege was attainable. Cap tain Potter next proceeded to Cape Coast, where he saw the members of the Meeting ; and, having consulted President Maclean, he returned to Eng land, resolved to exert himself, in order that, on his next voyage, he might, together with copies of the Scriptures, take out a Christian minister who should \" preach the word \" to those who were already united in seeking \"the way to eternal salvation,\" and proclaim the Gospel of Christ to other portions of the Heathenish native population of the Gold Coast. Immediately after his arrival at Bristol, Captain Potter communicated to the Wesleyan Mission ary Committee in London his views as to the promising opening for Missionary exertion in that part of Africa, and generously offered to take a Missionary with him on his next voyage,"], [290, "262 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. who might make personal observation and inquiry upon the spot ; and, should he conclude that the prospect was not such as to warrant his conti nuance for the purpose of commencing a mission, Captain Potter engaged that he would bring him back to England without any expense to the Missionary Society. This noble offer met with acceptance on the part of the Missionary Com mittee, and the Rev. Joseph Dunweh was selected for the interesting service. This devoted Missionary embarked with Cap tain Potter at Bristol, on the 17th of October, 1834. The entries in his private journal suffi ciently indicate the views with which he entered upon his arduous undertaking. Impressed with the responsibility which attached to him, and fearing lest the important mission might fail through bis incapacity, he studied daily, on his voyage, the lives of eminent missionaries, espe cially those of Brainerd and Martyn, in order that he might catch a larger measure of their spirit, and propose to himself as an example the zeal and self-denial by which they were charac terized. On the 6th of December, the ship came within sight of land near Cape Palmas ; and a few extracts from the journal of Mr. Dunwell, ibustrative of the character and manners of the natives, at the several places where they touched, as web as of his own feehngs whfle contem-"], [291, "263 CHAPTER X. plating their moral state, wdl be read with interest : \u2014 \"December 7th, 1834. At daylight we were seen by the natives; and in half an hour upwards of fifty men were on deck, the first of whom recognised Captain Potter, and appeared glad to see him. I observed immediately that they were most rapacious beggars. We shortly weighed anchor, it being Sunday, in order to secure greater quietness and tranquillity; but although we had a good breeze, a great number of canoes came off to us in the course of the day. These people are the most athletic and web-proportioned men I ever saw, and have most animated countenances. They seem exceedingly fond of Engbshmen, and say they would be glad if I would stay and bve with them, as there is no 'white man' at Sesters, Garraway, or Cape Palmas ; ab which places we passed to-day. The inhabitants appear numerous ; but Christ has not been named among them. What Christian can witness their numbers, and their degradation, without deep feeling ? I noticed that nearly aU we saw could speak broken Engbsh. The coun try appears almost like a paradise, though every thing springs spontaneously. At dusk we anchored off Cape Town, (an American settle ment,) which I intend to visit to-morrow, God willing."], [292, "264 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. ''Monday 8th. At day-break I saw many canoes coming off. Numbers of people were soon upon deck, with rice, fowls, and ivory, which they exchanged for articles of Engbsh manufacture. About nine o'clock, the king, whose name is Freeman, came, with several attendants. He was dressed in a coat and trowsers of coarse blue cloth, and wore a three-cornered hat, with a red cockade. A coloured sflk umbrella covered him from the rays of the sun. Epon entering the cabin, his attendants presented the treaty lately made between the Americans and himself, respecting the colony, (which is about twenty miles square,) in behalf of the Colonization Soci ety. Having received a note from Dr. Hah, the governor, Captain Potter accompanied me on shore, and we were pobtely received by the doctor, and his secretary, Mr. Thompson. \" While I was there, I was introduced to a man who told me that he was a member of the Wesleyan-Methodist society, and that there are sixteen persons who meet together in Christian fellowship on a Sunday morning.

No sooner were we seated, than a great number of natives assembled round us, in a state of perfect nudity ; and when we took our departure for the boat, we were escorted by scores of them to the shore. Mr. Thompson, the governor's secretary, told me that the people were astonished at me, and said among themselves, that I was a 'god man,' come to talk ' great palaver.' \" Tuesday, December 9th. To-day we have been visited by three kings, who ab appear to be great men in their way. They have many under their control. Kavaby seems to be next in importance to Cape Palmas. The news of a ' god-man ' (as they term me) having come, appears to have gone like bghtning down the coast. Cape Coast seems to be much envied, as these people also desfre to have a Missionary. We asked one of their chiefs last night if he would wish me to come and bve with him ; and, to express his meaning, he laid himself down, and extended his arms at full length, and said, 'You be my father, my brother.' Several chiefs have brought their sons to me, and wished me to take them, and teach them ' sensen.'

When I told him, he seemed utterly astonished, and said, ' That be great palaver indeed;' and, striking his head, he added, ' Wib keep that there good semen.' Ano ther came, and wrote on a slate, 'You come.' Upon examination, I found he could write his name, and read the alphabet ; another could read words of one and two sybables. The quickness with which they learn is amazing.

When I arose in the morn ing, I found that we were opposite the land of Drewin. The country still assumes the same appearance; but, to my surprise, I learned that few ships touch here, as the people are savage, and speak another language. Not many years ago, Captain Thomas Feebin, of the ship ' Union,' from Bristol, stopped here for the purposes of trade ; but, for some reason or other, the natives murdered the captain and the whole of the crew. They ransacked and plundered the vessel; and shortly after, Captain Potter passed, and caught"], [295, "267 CHAPTER X. some of the natives on the wreck ; but he was obbged to abandon it, in order to save his own life, and those of his crew. In the evening, as we passed along, we came in sight of a vibage named Kutro. Here the natives kindled a fire on the beach, as a signal for us to anchor ; but as we did not stop, two canoes came off, with some plan tains, bananas, and fowls, which we bought. These natives had a very different appearance from those we saw last, having nothing round their waists but a mere strap of cloth, instead of the Manchester cloths I observed round the others ; and they were afraid to come on deck, and seemed distrustful of ab of us in the extreme. \"Friday, 12th. Early this morning, we were opposite Pikanani Lahu, or Long-Jack's Place. Here the inhabitants appear exceedingly ignorant of rebgion or letters. If possible, they are worse beggars than I have seen before, as nothing seems to satisfy them. About one o'clock we arrived at Cape Lahu, and anchored. As usual, we had the decks soon fided with natives ; among these were kings, chiefs, and counsebors, who ab appeared exceedingly kind and famibar. They are athletic and web-proportioned ; and their cos tume is nothing but a belt round then\" waist. Some wear their hah\" in large tufts, others curled, plaited, and braided. \"Saturday, December 13th. At five o'clock n 2"], [296, "268 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. this morning, or soon after, I could perceive the canoes making to the vessel. In a short time the decks were covered from end to end. To-day I embraced the opportunity of making some inquiries about this people and the place, as it is acknowledged to ' be one of great importance. The town appears to be divided into two dis tricts, governed by two kings, namely, Peter and Antonio, both of whom I saw. Of the extent of these places I cannot speak positively; but the number of inhabitants certainly amounts to many thousands. The people appear to be possessed of gold; and I saw vast quantities of ivory. The country is low, but very fertile and pleasant, pro- ducing spontaneously every kind of vegetation necessary for its inhabitants. I very much wished to visit this people in then\" town, as they gave me several pressing invitations. King Peter told me he would budd me a house, if I would go; and one of his sons made me a present of half an ackie of gold, patted me on the face, and said, ' Me bke you face ; black man do.' My friend, Cap tain Potter, told me, that if they got me there, most likely they would keep me several days, tbl they had ab seen me. I felt a longing desire for the salvation of these people, and could have freely stayed with them, and given myself up into their hands, and spent my strength and life amongst them, for the glory of God."], [297, "CHAPTER X. 269 \" December 15th. I arose early this morning, and found we were opposite Pikanani Bassam. Here is a large population, exceedingly igno rant, and, at this time, engaged in war witli what are cabed the Bush-men. This is also the case with two large towns which we have passed, namely, Jack Lahu, and Jack Jaques ; so that we considered it best not to cab here. In the evening we came to anchor at Grand Bassam, one of the prettiest-looking places I ever saw. The town stands about six mbes up a noble river of the same name. It is a place of considerable importance. Old Kwosia, the king, is the greatest man we have seen. He possesses much wealth, and has a great number of wives. His influence is such, that nothing is done without his consent and approbation. We had not been here an hour, before he came on board. I was struck with his appearance; for although he is low in stature, there is something noble and dignified in his person. He is a complete man of business, and carries a large box of gold at his side, of no bttle value ; yet he wears a mean cloth round his waist, and assists occasionaby in rowing his canoe. If we have an opportunity of visiting his town, it is our intention so to do ; and I bebeve I shab be the first Christian Missionary that ever set foot in this place. \"December 16th. About nine o'clock this"], [298, "270 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. \u25a0morning, the king sent messengers to say, that he could not visit us for ten days, as one of his wives, and a brother, had died last night. Upon inquiry, the messengers told us, that they had been bewitched ; and that two persons would be sacrificed, as web as a thousand guns fired at the same time. \"December 17th. The roar of the guns, fired on account of the death of the king's wife, although at seven mbes' distance, was bke that of distant thunder. In the evening we took the boat, in order to ascertain whether we could land on the beach ; but as we found that it was nearly perpendicular, and the sweb very great, we did not attempt it ; so I fear that our intended visit to Grand Bassam wib be frustrated. \"December 20th. Another day has been on my part almost whoby unemployed. I cannot read for the continual noise on deck, much less think closely. The Africans are indeed a noisy people ; but this is not ab: they are ignorant in the extreme. To-day, whfle conversing with one of them, I introduced rebgion ; but, alas ! he was as ignorant as a brute ; he neither knew who made him, nor anything else. Ab I could get from him was, ' Great deril talk angry : ' signifying, that when it thundered, the deril was angry. \" December 23d.

This place seems to have sprung up from one of the same name, destroyed by the king of Apollonia; who is a dreadful tyrant, carrying terror and destruction wherever he comes. Although the people at this place are poor in comparison with some of their neighbours, yet they are industrious. One young man who came on board, and cabs himself 'Tom Coffee,' says he has been at Liverpool, and went to church. He appeared much surprised at what he saw and heard.\" Leaving this place, they cabed at Dix Cove and Commenda, both which towns have since become mission-stations ; and on the 29th of December, the vessel anchored off the Dutch fort of Elmina. At this place, within sight of Cape- Coast Castle, Mr. Dunweb wrote in his journal as fobows : \" What my feehngs have been this day, I cannot describe. The place of my future residence is in view : it may prove the spot where I shall finish my earthly existence ; and there the name of Jesus Christ may be honoured, or dishonoured, by me. But, in the strength of grace, I trust that whether my days may be many, or soon numbered, they wib be spent in the service of God. All things appear to me to sink into nothingness, compared with the great work of my Divine Lord and Master.\" While at anchor off Elmina, Mr. Dunweb"], [300, "272 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. wrote a letter to President Maclean, at Cape- Coast Castle, respectfully informing him of his arrival on the coast, and stating the objects con templated by the Wesleyan Missionary Com mittee, in sending him as a Missionary to that part of Africa. On his arrival a day or two afterwards at Cape-Coast Castle, he met with a kind reception from the President, who invited him to remain at the castle until he could pro vide himself with a suitable residence; and expressed his opinion, that there was a very favourable opening among the natives for Mis sionary exertions. By the native young men who formed the Society or Meeting for reading the holy Scrip- tures, Mr. Dunweb was received with the warm- est expressions of gratitude and debght. When the tidings reached Cape-Coast Castle, that there was a Missionary on board a vessel from Eng- land lying off Elmina, they hardly dared to give credit to such welcome intelligence; and one of them immediately proceeded to Elmina to satisfy himself by ocular demonstration that the report was true. They placed themselves at once under the care of Mr. Dunweb, who commenced his pubbe ministry at Cape-Coast town on the first sabbath after he landed ; which, from the entry in his journal, appears to have been January 4th, 1835. Speaking of the congregation to which"], [301, "CHAPTER X. 273 he preached his first sermon, composed of the members of the Meeting, and a few others, Mr. Dunweb remarks: \"The deepest attention was manifested ; joy beamed on every countenance ; \" and adds, \"Their gratitude is without bounds, and they say, ' We did never think of the Mis sionary's coming to teach black man.' \" One class of persons, however, the fetishmen, speedfly took the alarm, and used their influence to prevent the people from attending pubbe Christian worship; and many of their steadfast votaries employed ridicule and threats, for the purpose of deterring their friends and neighbours from bstening to the truths of the Gospel; meeting them on their return from the public service, and saying, \"What, you turn White? You know not, that God gave the Bible to White man, and fetish to Black man ? How dare you go and forsake the rebgion of your forefathers?\" But, in spite of such opposition, the people flocked to the ministry of Mr. Dunweb at Cape- Coast Castle, Annamaboe, and other places which he visited; and, under the divine blessing, the great doctrines of Christianity produced a salu tary effect on many minds; and the number of those who were united together in church - febowship steadby increased. Mr. Dunweb, in his correspondence at the time, mentioned, with much satisfaction, a striking instance of decision n 5"], [302, "274 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. in the case of a woman, who brought out her household gods into the open air, and pubbcly burned them in the presence of her Heathen neighbours. The mission soon assumed a most promising appearance. The large room in which pubhc service had been held at Cape-Coast town proved too smab; and a subscription was commenced among the natives for the erection of a suitable chapel. Mr. Dunweb had secured general respect among ab classes of society, and was receiving appbcations to afford the benefit of his labours to distant places. But in the midst of the anticipa- tions which this hopeful state of things inspired, he was attacked by fever, under which he sunk in a few days ; and left the societies winch he had been instrumental in forming, as sheep without a shepherd. The last entries in his own journal, and the notices furnished by Mr. Joseph Smith, the native master of the school at the castle, show with what feelings this useful Missionary met his death; far from his father's home, uncheered by the presence of mother, or sister, or other relative, and attended only by those to whom his generous quabties had endeared him in the land of strangers.- On Sunday, the 14th of June, 1835, having mentioned that he had preached twice, although unwell, he added: \"After the evening-service I had"], [303, "275 CHAPTER X. a most violent head-ache, with some fever and sickness, which continued till I retired to rest. There appeared every symptom of what is cabed the ' seasoning,' which so frequently proves fatal ; stib I cannot describe the peace of mind I felt. I feel that I am a most worthless sinner ; and have no hope, no plea beside, but that Jesus died for me : were it not for this, I should be lost for ever.\" The day after, he used his pen for the last time, and wrote : \" I passed an exceedingly restless night, having great pain of body, so that I rested very bttle. Yet, 0 the composure of mind ! I bebeve I can say, ' In life or in death I am the Lord's.' \" \"On the 24th instant,\" Mr. Smith says, \"Mr. Dunweb sent for me this morning; and, to my great sorrow, I found him worse than I expected. On my first entering the room, he called me by name, and, having conversed with me for a considerable time on various subjects, desired me to pray for him. I knelt by the side of his bed, and engaged in prayer for about a quarter of an hour : he also prayed himself. He besought the Lord to let the cup pass from him, as the sons of this part of Africa would be left to grope in darkness, if he were removed away by death. At this I was uncommonly sorry; but he encouraged me to hope in the"], [304, "276 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Lord ; for the debt of nature must be paid. He repeated the fourth verse of the twenty-third psalm : ' Though I walk through the vabey of the shadow of death, I wib fear no eril ; for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.' If I may use the expression, I would say, ' Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be bke his.' When it was now time to leave him, and attend the school, he said, with tears, ' Brother Smith, we have passed many agreeable evenings in conversing ou instructive subjects j but I have to teb you I shah soon be absent from you, and be present with the Lord. I am going hence, and shah be no more seen; but watch over the flock, and strengthen them in the Lord, when I am gone.' About four o'clock in the afternoon I visited him again. He was quite insensible; the pangs of death had seized him, and every hope of his recovery was then lost : between eight and nhie o'clock he expired.\" Thus died the Rev. Joseph Dunwell. No words of disappointment or regret escaped his bps, on account of his having so early sacrificed his life in the Missionary enterprise; but a quenchless zeal for the cause of his Divine Master sustained him to the last, and ab the solicitude which he manifested was sor the bifant church formed by his instrumentality. Tins afflictive dispensation produced the deepest"], [305, "CHAPTER X. 277 feehng among ab who took any interest in the mission. On the fobowing morning, a native wrote, \"Sad news in the town; the shepherd is away ! The poor Missionary is reported dead.\" Great numbers of the native people, and the resi dent Engbsh gentlemen, attended his funeral; and the governor having read the funeral-service, that beautiful and appropriate hymn which is numbered fifty-one in the Wesleyan Hymn-Book was sung over the grave by the members of the -society. On the day after the funeral, the bereaved society met, to take into consideration the cir cumstances in which they were placed by the afflictive dispensation which had overtaken them. The artless manner in which a record of this meeting was made in the minute-book of the society, wib best explain the conclusion which was adopted : \" I met the class on purpose to know whether they would continue in the profession they had recently entered into, or desire to return to their former ways, in consequence of the death of their Missionary. They said, they would remain in the new profession; for though the Missionary was dead, God hves. We commended our souls in prayer to- God, and separated at ten o'clock.\" A respectful letter was then addressed to John Jackson and John Barr, Esquhes, who had kindly"], [306, "278 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. undertaken the administration of Mr. Dunweb's affairs, preferring a request that they would use their influence for the purpose of inducing the Wesleyan Missionary Committee to appoint an other Missionary to Cape-Coast Castle ; and those gentlemen obbgingly communicated to the Committee in London the particulars respecting Mr. Dunweb's lamented death, and the earnest wish of the native members of the society respecting the mission. The Committee, unable to reconcile to their conviction of duty the abandonment of a work which had been so auspiciously begun, resolved to more than meet the appbcation, by sending two Missionaries, on the principle that the interests of a mission ia such a climate as that of Western Africa ought not to be left to the care of only one individual. It was further agreed, that the two Missionaries to be sent should be married men, in order that their wives might attend to the improvement of the native females. The communication of the intentions of the Committee was received with unbounded satis- faction by the members at Cape Coast, who continued to hold their religious meetings with regularity, and were exerting themselves to raise subscriptions for the erection of a suitable chapel. When the Rev. G. O. Wrigley landed there, on the 15th of September, 1836, he found that the"], [307, "279 CHAPTER X. society had increased in numbers, and that the influence of Christianity was felt to a considerable distance inland. This was so manifestly the case, that the fetishmen at Abrah, in the Braffo country, had taken the alarm, and used means to counteract the spread of a system by which then\" own \" craft \" was so greatly endangered. It was announced, that the great fetish, Nanah Num, was highly offended with the caboceers in the bush, for allowing their people to renounce the gods of their fathers ; and a man was sent to say, that he had been caught up by the fetish into the air, and bad received a message for the people, to the effect, that if they did not immediately reject the new rebgion, the fetish would not send any more rain. By such means, Afo, the caboceer of Donasi, was so alarmed, that he abandoned a school which had been estabbshed among his people. But another school, formed by George Amisa, son of the caboceer at Domonasi, was stih continued, in spite of the threats of the great fetish. Mr. Wrigley commenced his varied labours with zeal ; and a suitable place of worship having become indispensably necessary, he undertook, without delay, the erection of a commodious budding, including a chapel and school-rooms; the expense of which was estimated at five hun dred pounds sterhng. Mrs. Wrigley also evinced"], [308, "280 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. her pity for her degraded sex by opening a school for native girls, where she instructed them in the Engbsh language, sewing, and other useful branches of learning; but they were deprived by death, in a few months, of then\" disinter ested benefactress. Mr. and Mrs. Harrop, who had also been appointed by the Committee to the Cape-Coast Mission, landed there in January,: 1837; when, owing to the injurious exposure of themselves to the effects of the sun in the middle of the day, they were almost immediately attacked by fever, which proved fatal to them both ; and Mrs. Wrigley sunk under the fatigue which she experienced, whfle attending, with affectionate anxiety, by night and by day, to her suffering friends. The shock which Mr. Wrigley received from this compbcated bereavement was the more severely felt, as he himself was only just recover ing from a bibous fever; but he soou applied himself anew to his various ministerial and pastoral duties, at the same time superintending the erection of the new chapel, and prosecuting the study of the native language, untb the month of November, when he was taken ib as he was returning by water from Annamaboe, (Anamabu,) and in a few days died in the sub triumph of Christian faith. The death of this truly excebent Missionary produced a great sensa-"], [309, "281 CHAPTER X. tion; and his funeral was one of the most affecting scenes which had for a long time been witnessed. The arrival of the Rev. Thomas B. Freeman, with Mrs. Freeman, early in January, 1838, once more revived the drooping spirits of the native society, who came from various parts to welcome their new friends. Mr. Freeman had zealously entered upon the duties of his mission, When he was attacked with the seasoning-fever; and whfle watching with sobcitude his sick-bed, Mrs. Freeman was seized with a violent inflammatory complaint, which terminated her life in a few hours. The death of this valuable woman was a great loss to the native females, for whose benefit she had made some important arrangements ; and her funeral furnished evidence of the respect which she had secured for herself from ab classes of society. Mr. Freeman graduaby recov- ered his health; and from that period, untb the time of his visit to England in 1840, he was engaged in the execution of plans which have contributed greatly, under the divine blessing, to the enlargement and estabbshment of the Mission at the Gold Coast. The completion of the new chapel was effected shortly after Mr. Freeman's recovery. In this work, the zeal of the natives had been strikingly manifested. During the rains, a large part of the"], [310, "282 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. wab, which had been built of swish, was washed down ; but the native people and chOdren carried no fewer than four thousand pieces of stone from the distance of a mbe, for the purpose of repair ing the breach; and they fetched four thousand bundles of a particular kind of grass from a place six mbes distant, for the purpose of thatching the roof, which had been sent from England. On the 10th of June, 1838, Mr. Freeman had the satisfaction of conducting the opening-service, in a substantial place of worship, large enough to accommodate from seven hundred to one thou sand persons on the ground-floor. Two com modious vestries are also attached to the chapel. The first service was attended by President Maclean and several other Europeans, and by at least twelve hundred natives; for, those who were not able to obtain admission within the edifice crowded round the door and windows, and there participated in the sacred service. The President and other Engbsh residents contributed handsomely towards defraying the expenses of the erection. In noticing the several places to which this mission has extended, Annamaboe (Anamabu) first claims attention. This place, the name of which has been rendered famibar by the attack of the Ashantees, enjoyed the benefit of Mr. Dunweb's labours, aud of those of his successor,"], [311, "283 CHAPTER X. Mr. Wrigley. A chapel was commenced here also ; but the walls having been brought down by the rains, another was bubt, on a larger scale, and opened for pubbe worship on the 26th of May, 1839. The natives at this place emulated the zeal of the Cape-Coast people in their exertions to provide themselves with a suitable place of worship. The inhabitants of Winnebah had their atten tion first cabed to the claims of Christianity by Mr. Wilham De Graft, who went to reside there, and soon prevaded upon some of the natives to unite with him in rebgious meetings. The people of this place had unhappdy acquired an infamous notoriety, by their violence and rapacity, and especiaby by their murder of Governor Meredith, in the year 1812. Whfle walking in the garden of the fort, he was suddenly siezed by a num ber of persons, who hurried him away into the \" bush,\" and there charged him with detaining a quantity of gold, the property of a native, which, as they abeged, a serjeant had debvered to him at the time when the Ashantees visited the neigh bourhood ; at the same time declaring, that they would not bberate him until he gave up the gold. The serjeant had forgotten to whose care he had committed the property, untd he consulted the great fetish at Abrah, and was told by the oracle, that he had consigned it to Mr. Meredith ; and,"], [312, "284 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. after this authoritative announcement, it was in vain that the unfortunate governor maintained the groundlessness of the charge, and that he knew nothing of the gold. On being informed of the seizure of the go vernor, Mr. Smith, who had the care of the Tantum Fort, hastened to Winnebah, when he was immediately seized by a body of natives, and conducted to the place where Mr. Meredith was confined ; and as it serves to indicate the obstacles which the character of such a people necessarily presents to the introduction of Christianity, Mr. Smith shah describe what he saw in his own words : \u2014 \" After walking a mbe and a half in the interior, escorted by a numerous body of people, I met with an assembly of the Pynims, seated on the ground. I was cabed, and desbed to take my place in the centre ; which after doing, I made inquiry into the cause of such outrageous conduct, and urged them to produce Mr. Mere dith. After waiting half an hour, he was brought in, on a man's back ; for so wearied was he, from the cruel usage he had received, as to be unable to walk. The situation he was first introduced in was a lamentable sight, and the wound it gave my feelings it is impossible to describe : so much affected was he, that tears would force their way. His face and clothes were covered with dirt, and his clothes were torn in half. He said, the treat-"], [313, "CHAPTER X. 285 ment he had experienced from these savages the day before was so inhuman, that he had offered them an order on the fort for the whole of the property he was possessed of, in order to get hberated from them ; but this they refused, and insisted on detaining him until he debvered up the gold he was unjustly accused of having received. He therefore requested that I would do ab in my power to compromise the business, and release him from such a miserable situation. Some time after, the mob retiring a short dis tance from us, he recited the particulars of the treatment he had suffered. Whilst taking his usual morning's walk in the garden, he was surrounded by a number of the town's-people,* and hurried away as fast as possible. They obbged him to walk some miles in the heat of the sun ; during which, they were guilty of many outrages against him. The dried grass was set on fire, and he was forced to walk close to the flame. His shoes he was obbged to take off and put on alternately, as it suited their caprice, and to walk without them on the sharp stubble of the grass which had been just burnt. He received blows with a stick ; and they twice made an attempt to cut his stockings off, and put him in irons. They extended his arms, by tying them to a stake, which pressed hard on his throat; and at this time, he said, he fully expected that they were"], [314, "286 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. about to put a period to his existence. Indeed, the cruelty with which he had been used was such as to make him covet death, and he was perfectly resigned to his fate; they however spared him, to inflict more miseries upon him. After remain ing a short time in one part of the bush, he was taken to another, and so on tfll night, when it was with great difficulty that he could prevail on them to allow a mattress to be brought him. He was obbged to sleep in the open air, surrounded by a number of his tormentors, who continued their abuse with noise and riot throughout the night, during which they forced him to send to the fort for tobacco and ankers of bquor, just as they thought proper to demand them. At day-break they carried him off again to some distance from the place where he had slept; and, on my arrival, he was brought back to the spot where I met the Pynims.\" From the effect of these sufferings, Mr. Mere dith died before any effectual means could be taken to extricate him from the hands of the natives ; and his successor, Mr. James, having been blockaded in the fort, by the natives, for three months, appbcation was then made to the Honourable Captain Irby, of His Majesty's sjnp \" Ameba,\" who proceeded to Winnebah ; aud, the fort having been blown up, the place was altogether abandoned as a British settlement."], [315, "CHAPTER X. 287 On the very spot where the Winnebah Fort once stood, a mission-chapel was commenced, chiefly through the exertions of Wilham De Graft, bi the month of July, 1838, which was opened for divine worship on the 2d of June fobowing. A school has also been estabbshed, and a number of natives are united together in church febowship. The formation of a school at Domonasi, by the son of the chief, has already been mentioned. The people at that place have erected, at their own expense, a smab chapel, in which pubbe worship was celebrated for the first time on the 25th of November, 1839. The commencement of a chapel at Salt Pond occasioned considerable alarm to the fetishmen. Mr. Freeman, having obtained a piece of land from the chief of the place, had caused the ground to be excavated for the foundation ; but when he accompanied the workmen to the place on the fobowing morning, he found that a fetishman had placed in the hole, where the foundation stone was to be laid, an idol image, for the pur pose of deterring the people from proceeding with the work. Mr. Freeman, aware of the pre judices with which he had to contend, appbed to the chief, requesting him to remove the image ; but he declined to interfere, Mr. Freeman then appealed to him whether he had not bought the"], [316, "288 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. land, and whether it was fair or honest to attempt to deprive him of his purchase. The chief admit ted, without hesitation, his claims, but stib shrunk from the task of dislodging the new occupant of the property. At length, however, the Missionary gained his point; the image was removed; and the chapel which was then commenced has since been opened for pubhc worship under favourable circumstances. When the first rebgious service was held in the chapel, a large number of the inhabitants, who were unable to obtain admission within the wabs, on account of the crowd, brought then\" native stools and sat on the outside. The school which has been commenced excites much interest ; and the people tell the Missionary, that they send their children to him for instruction because they bebeve that he has come among them to do them good : and whbe the Mission is thus rising in the pubbe estimation, the cause of superstition is rapidly declining. At the date of a recent letter, the people were much amused with the embarrassment of the priest, because some one had stolen a brass pan consecrated to the fetish, and the oracle was unable to name the thief. At Commenda, and Abasa, chapels have also been erected. At British Accra, (Akrah,) a pro mising society has been formed; and a school has been undertaken. At Mansu, also, a pros perous school has been estabbshed."], [317, "289 CHAPTER X. For the purpose of enabling the Missionaries to prosecute their labours among the natives with greater regularity and effect, three Dis tricts or Circuits have been formed; in each of which, one or more Engbsh Missionaries are placed, with native agents as then\" assistants. The first of these Circuits is that of Cape-Coast town, the principal places connected with which are Commenda and Dix Cove; the second is that of Annamaboe, (Anamabu,) including Salt Pond, Domonasi, Mansu, and Abasa; the third is that of British Accra (Akrah) and Win nebah. To various other places, where there are openings for usefulness, \u2014 one of which is Djuquah, where Kujoh Chibbu, who took so prominent a part in the Ashantee war, and fifteen thousand of his people, are now located, \u2014 the Missionaries wib direct their attention as time and opportunity serve. At the several stations which have been enumerated, between six and seven hundred natives have renounced the idolatry of their ancestors, and are now united together as members of the Wesleyan society; ancl nearly three hundred chddren are receiving a rebgious education in the mission schools. Two schools, one at Annamaboe, and the other at Accra, were estabbshed by the assistance of President Maclean; and the Committee in Lon- o"], [318, "290 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. don, by whom, under tbe Imperial Government, the affairs of the Gold Coast are conducted, laud ably anxious to promote the sound instruction of the rising generation, kindly made a grant for the purpose of defraying half the expense. A few anecdotes, ibustrative of the process by which the native mind has been disenthralled to so great an extent from the influence of the superstition of ages, wib not, perhaps, be unac ceptable to the reader. Shortly after the commencement of the Wes leyan mission, a fetishman, named Akwah, came from the interior to Cape-Coast town, who pro fessed to be able, when he had bruised a bead to powder, to unite the particles together again, and make it what it was before. Several persons put his skib to the test, and he contrived so adroitly to sbp other beads into the places of the powdered ones, that the spectators were led to bebeve that he had ready restored the broken beads to their former state. He professed, more over, that he could thrust his finger through a stone, and produced one with a hole in it, which hole he said was made by his finger; and he managed to obtain credit with the peo ple for having done it, although they did not see the abeged feat performed. He stated, moreover, that he had sufficient influence to cab apes from the bush, and make them talk with"], [319, "291 CHAPTER X. the people; but he could not do this in the day-time, because he said the apes were timid, and shunned the bght. He therefore took his dupes into the bush after dark, and they returned into the town perfectly satisfied that they had conversed with apes. By such exploits, he gained great renown, and considerable profit; and then proceeded to Elmina, and Commenda, and hav ing convinced the people there of the great powers of his fetish, he returned to Cape-Coast town. After his return, a native trader, possessed of some wealth, was taken ib, and consulted Akwah, who engaged speedfly to restore him to health. The trader then expressed a wish to witness some of the great feats, of which he had heard so much, and especially desired to hear the apes talk. Akwah was quite ready to comply with his request ; but, as the apes were stib averse to the light, it was arranged that the meeting should be deferred until eight o'clock in the evening. The bght of the gospel was, however, just be ginning to exert sufficient influence upon the mind of the trader to awaken some doubt as to the powers of the fetishman ; and he resolved to use every precaution to prevent himself from being imposed upon. He accordingly instructed his servant boys, who were to accompany him with a present of rum, to take care to ascertain o 2"], [320, "292 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. who or what it was to whom they gave it ; and, at the appointed time, taking four flasks of rum, containing about one gahon, he proceeded to the appointed place, near to the spot where the mis sion-house now stands. Ab things being ready, Akwah began to cab for the apes, tebing them that a man of distinction had come to hear them, and begging them to honour his fetish by obeying the summons. At length, a rushing noise was heard in the bush, and a smab voice proceeded from it, saying, \" We have come : give us some rum.\" The trader immediately sprung forward, saying, \" I wib give it to them ; \" but Akwah interposed, tebing him, that it would be more consistent with his dignity to sit down, and abow his servants to perform the duty. Little, however, did Akwah suspect that the boys had been previously instructed as to the part which they should act, or anticipate the result which fobowed. The boys took the flasks, and tlnust them into the bush whence the voices pro ceeded ; and each, as he extended a flask in one hand, stretched out also the other, that he might be able to ascertain by feebng what was the reci pient. It being quite dark, this man\u0153uvre could not be perceived; and immediately one of the boys cabed out to his master, \"My father, my father! it is not an ape; I have caught a boy's hand.\" \" Hold it fast,\" repbed the trader, \" until"], [321, "L-n.vr-n .

When Wilham De Graft resided at Winnebah, a circumstance occurred, which tended to impress many of the people in favour of the new rebgion which he taught. A great scarcity of fish having occurred, it was proposed to send messengers to the great fetish at Abrah to \"buy fish,\" that is, to prevab upon the gods to give them a good fishing-season. De Graft ridiculed the idea of their going into the\" country to buy fish, when they had only to put off into the sea in their canoes, and catch it for themselves. However, it was determined that the influence of the fetish should be sought ; and the messengers carried up to Abrah a present for the fetish, amounting ia value to _S4 sterbng. A promise of help was obtained ; but two unfavourable seasons fobowed, in which bttle fish was caught ; and the people were, in consequence, reduced to great straits. The cause of the failure then became the subject of much discussion. Some were of opinion, that the messengers had slept on their way back from Abrah, and that another fetish, who was angry that he had not been apphed to, had embraced the opportunity of stealing away the fish which they had bought ; but others acknow ledged to De Graft, that their faith in the power of the fetish was greatly shaken."], [323, "295 CHAPTER X. \"On another occasion, a fire had taken place at Winnebah, and De Graft asked some of the Heathen inhabitants, who laughed when they met him in the street, why it was that they were so cheerful ; they told him to go with them and see. He accompanied them to the ruins ; found that the fire had burned down a fetish-house; and saw the fetish images lying in a half-consumed state. The people then said : \" We laughed when we saw you, because we knew that you would tell us that we had better forsake the worship of gods which could not save themselves from the fire.\" De Graft embraced the opportunity of deepening the impression which he perceived was made upon then minds, and exhorted them to turn to the true God, who was alone worthy of their con fidence. They admitted that it would be better to serve the God of the Christians ; but they said they were not able, at once, to break off their customs. Several natives, however, from that time, became regular in then\" attendance at the pubbe worship in the mission-chapel. One more anecdote shah suffice : When Wilham De Graft, and other native Christians, first visited some smab crooms at the foot of a large hib, generally known by the name of the Deril's Hib, (although the natives cab it Mankoh,) about five miles from Winnebah, they preached to the inhabitants on the goodness of God, and the"], [324, "296 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. freeness of the salvation of the Gospel; assur ing them that they needed not take money and goods to the true God, as they did to the fetish. At length the people expressed a wish that they had heard those doctrines sooner; and gave the fobowing account. They said that they had for two or three successive seasons employed themselves in clearing away the bush on the side of the hib, and forming planta tions for the support of their famibes, when the priests at Abrah sent down messengers to inform them, that the fetish of the hib, Mankoh, had been to Abrah, and complained to the fetish there, that the people had cleared away, or burned up, the bush which had covered the hib ; and that he was suffering much pain in consequence. The people were therefore required to send back by the messengers, two ounces of gold as a peace offering, or the superior fetish would inflict upon them some terrible punishment for their offence ; and as they had recently seeu a number of wolves in the neighbourhood, whom they regarded as the messengers of the great fetish, they immediately paid the gold, to prevent the consequences which they seriously anticipated."], [325, "CHAPTER XI.

But the writer is fuby aware of the debcacy and difficulty of the task of furnishing such evidence ; and how easfly, without the exercise of much caution, he might subject himself to the charge of exaggeration. It is a fact, that travebers and others, who have opportunity of personally observing the proceedings of Missionaries in Heathen lands, do not always sufficiently appre ciate the effects of their teaching. An unfair cri terion is frequently adopted ; either the attain ments of the native converts are compared with the acquirements of Christians in enlightened and civilized countries, or, in some other way, the disadvantages of their condition are overlooked ;"], [327, "CHAPTER XI. 299 and, as a natural result, ab the benefits which have actuaby resulted from the instructions of the Missionaries are not perceived and acknow ledged. Duly to estimate the change which has been effected by Missionary labours, the present state of the people whose benefit has been sought, should be contrasted with their former Heathen condition; and the comparison ought to be instituted under the sub impression of the truth, that the elevation of a people from the depths of barbarism is not the work of a day. The writer is persuaded, that if this mode of investigation be adopted, the candid inquirer wib find, that a very considerable amount of benefit has been produced by the instrumentality of the Wesleyan Mission at the Gold Coast. The new class of rebgious observances which has been introduced, cannot fab to arrest the attention of the truly enlightened Christian observer. Instead of the superstitious fetish practices to which they formerly resorted at the beginning of the day, the natives attached to the mission now regularly assemble at the early hour of five in the morning, for the purpose of prayer, and of singing the praises of the true God. Every sabbath morning at six o'clock, pubbe worship is celebrated in the chapel at Cape-Coast town, when the hturgy of the Estabbshed Church is read ; and the decorum which is observed by the"], [328, "300 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. natives, who repeat the responses with an impres siveness superior, as Wilham De Graft remarked, to what he has witnessed in any congregation in England, appears in striking opposition to the wdd and irrational service which they formerly offered at the temples of the fetish. The scenes which the death-beds and funerals of the Chris tian natives present, are altogether new. In his last hours, the native convert is not now surrounded by fetish priests, practising their incantations for his recovery ; but, freed from superstitious fears, he commends, with calm con fidence, his departing spirit into the hands of bis Lord and Saviour : and the funeral pro cession which accompanies his corpse to the grave stands out in such pleasing contrast to the revolting scenes which Heathen funerals exhibit, that many of the idolaters are led to acknowledge the superiority of the Christian rebgion over then- degrading and inhuman superstitions. An improvement in the morals of the native converts is equaby observable. The case of one who was employed in conveying goods to an Engbsh vessel may be mentioned in ibustration. Having returned to the shore, he found that he had accidentaby overlooked a quantity of ivory, amounting in value to thirty pounds sterling ; and be immediately put off again in his canoe, with"], [329, "301 CHAPTER XI. the intention of giving it to the captain. The vessel, however, had proceeded so far, that he waa not able to overtake it : and on his return he went immediately to the castle, and placed the property in the keeping of the President of the Councd, to be restored to the captain on his next voyage. The change of conduct in many of the native converts is so manifest, that Heathen parents are heard to say, \" How is this ? Our chddren, who were formerly unkind and disobe dient, now treat us with respect and attention, and take care of us in sickness and old age. Surely the Missionaries have come amongst us to do us good.\" And Heathen masters, seeing that then domestics are now dibgent and attentive to their duties, adopt, in many cases, the same conclusion as to the tendency of Missionary instruction. The change effected in domestic life is espe ciaby deserving of notice. Polygamy, one of the greatest evils in African society, yields to the influence of the Gospel. The Missionaries do not abow any natives to become members of their rebgious societies until they renounce polygamy and concubinage. When this point is gained, and a native has agreed to be the faithful husband of the one wife whom he retains, a difficulty occurs on the point of Christian marriage. Engbsh ladies wib smfle at the reasoning of the African"], [330, "302 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. husband on this subject: he is sometimes heard to argue, that, should he be united to his wife by a tie which nothing but death can sever, he would not be able to keep her in due subjection ; because he could no longer employ the threat, once so avaibng, that if she does not please him he would put her away. Encouraged, how- ever, by the Missionaries to hope, that rebgious motives wib operate more beneficiahy upon the mind of the female than threats and menaces, the husband, in numerous instances, has ventured to unite himself, in the bonds of an indissoluble union, to the wife to whom Heathenism so loosely attached him. Many domestic rircles now pleasingly exhibit the change which Christianity effects. The husband no longer bves alone, and sends to the wife her meals in a separate house, when he has finished his own repast; but both now dweb in the same habitation, and, with their children, eat together at the same table. The husband does not now devolve upon the wife the heaviest burden; but himself labours for the support of the famfly, and she devotes her attention to domestic duties. A taste for the decencies and comforts of European life has been introduced ; and many native famibes have adopted the Engbsh mode of dress, and furnish their houses in Engbsh style. Whfle on this point, the want of female schools"], [331, "CHAPTER XI. 303 may be properly noticed. Many of the other sex are obtaining a decent education j and when this is completed, the untaught and degraded females are whoby unfit to make them suitable com panions for life. The wives of the Missionaries, it is true, have exerted themselves with laudable industry to instruct the youth of then* own sex ; and the mission-school at this tune contains several interesting girls, who are making considerable proficiency in useful attainments; but the want of a more extensive provision is greatly felt, and the writer ventures to express his deep conviction, that there are few works of greater charity to which British females could extend their aid, than the promotion of a comprehensive plan for the education of the females of the Gold Coast. The spirit of industry, and desire for general improvement, winch have been excited, are strik ingly evidenced by the fact, that many of the Christian natives appbed to Mr. Freeman to obtain for them, whfle he was in England, the means of introducing an improved method of agri culture, and such other assistance as would enable them to advance more rapidly towards a state of civilization. An extract from a Report on this subject, drawn up by Mr. Freeman during his visit to this country, wib be read with interest. After expressing a decided opinion of the practicability of Sir T. Foweb Buxton's plans for the instruc-"], [332, "304 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. tion and elevation of the natives of Africa, he proceeds : \u2014 \" It is with great pleasure I state, that many of the natives of Fantee, with whom I have had frequent intercourse, and who have already laid aside their Heathen errors, and embraced Chris tianity, are very anxious to engage in agricultural pursuits ; and have requested me to render them some assistance, by taking out for them, on my return to Africa, a supply of seeds, implements of husbandry, and anything that would be useful to them in cultivating their native soil. At Domonasi, a smab Fantee town, about twenty five mbes in the interior, there is a bttle band of Christians', about sixty in number, with the young Chief of the district at their head, who are now anxiously awaiting my return with a supply of the above-mentioned things. There are also many of the natives of Cape Coast and Annamaboe, (Anamabu,) who have smab plantations in the bush, at a distance of from three to ten miles from these towns, who are now turning their attention, more fuby than they have ever before done, to the cultivation of the soil. These requests on the part of the natives have impressed our minds with the importance of estabbshing, at the earbest opportunity, two model-farms in the interior of Fantee (Fanti) ; that we may thereby have the means of teaching"], [333, "305 CHAPTER XI. them the best methods of culture, and of showing them the very great capabilities of the sob. One of these farms wih be estabbshed at Domonasi, and the other at Mansu, formerly the great slave -mart, and stib a considerable town and dis trict, about fifty mfles on the road to Ashantee (As-hanti). In each of these places, a residence sor a Missionary is now being prepared ; and we hope that, in the course of a few months, both these posts wib be occupied ; when one of the great objects of the Missionaries wib be, that of instructing in the practical science of agri culture ab those natives, whether Christians or Heathens, who may feel disposed to turn their attention to it. \u25a0 \"The moral improvement which has already taken place in Domonasi, is beginning to have a powerful bearing on the social condition of the people. Their houses are kept more clean and decent than those of the Heathens ; and they are imbibing a taste for those many domestic com forts and conveniences, which are to be found in an European cottage. Several of them are also beginning to wear European clothes, and have requested me to take them out a fresh supply, on my return from England. The effects produced in the mind of the Heathen in the surrounding neighbourhood, by these salutary changes, are also becoming strikingly manifest. They begin"], [334, "306 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. to admire the improved social condition of their Domonasi neighbours, often calling their town a ' white man's croom ; ' and, as a natural conse quence, they are now feehng, in some measure, at least, a respect for that rebgion which has been the cause of such a beneficial change.\" The fobowing fact is illustrative of the frankness with which the Heathen generahy ac knowledge the good effects of the mission. A native, who had married the daughter of a chief, having become a Christian, soon mani fested a desire to improve his condition; and carefuby hoarded the fruits of his industry, until he was able to purchase European clothing for his wife and himself. The first day on which they arrayed themselves in their new attire, they paid a visit to their Heathen father, who was so much surprised at their appearance, that he rose up to receive them; and expressed his wishes, that the God in whose service they had become so respectable would continue to bless them, and do them good. The testimony of the principal chief on the coast, who is dignified with the title of king, may also be adduced. When Mr. Freeman, on the eve of his embarkation for England, cabed upon Agri to bid him fareweb, he acknowledged, as he had frequently done before, that Christianity was effecting a great deal of good in the country."], [335, "307 CHAPTER XI. On Mr. Freeman's expressing his regret that he should not be able to inform his friends in Eng land, that Agri had embraced Christianity, the chief rephed, that although that was not the case, many of his people had become Christians ; and he hoped that Mr. Freeman could give a better account of the people on the coast than many travebers had done, who had generaby described them as turbulent and unmanageable. He hoped that the Missionaries could testify, that they were not so now. Evidence more conclusive, as to the salutary effects of Missionary instruction, cannot, however, be brought forward than the fact, that instances are not wanting of fetish priests having embraced Christianity, and apphed themselves to honest and industrious pursuits. The case of Domonasi having been submitted to Sir Thomas Foweb Buxton, Baronet, and by him to the Committee for the Society for the Extinc- tion of the Slave-Trade, and for the Civilization of Africa, that Committee liberally met the request pf the chief, by voting the sum of One Hundred Pounds, to be laid out in the purchase of various agricultural implements for the use of himself and his people, Mr. Freeman engaging to employ his influence and personal exertions for securing the right appropriation of the grant. Matthew Foster, Esq., generously added to the grant"], [336, "308 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. of the Committee another sum, for the pur chase of ploughs and of harness for oxen. Thus furnished, Mr. Freeman returned, with the con fident hope, that a very great improvement wfll ere long be effected in the social condition of the people at Domonasi. His expectation is, that the chief wib be persuaded to let out the land in small farms, for a fixed annual rent; and, this principle once admitted, the independ ence of the people wib be secured, and domestic slavery wbl entirely pass away. The influence of the mission, it may be ob served, is steadily exerted in promoting the cause of rational freedom. The Missionaries constantly inculcate on the chiefs the Christian doctrine, that ab souls are of equal value in the sight of God; and that a subordinate station in society does not stamp him who fibs it with an essential inferiority. When Mr. Freeman has heard, that any chief to whom he has become known has ill treated a slave, he has not failed to send a mes senger to expostulate with him, and to enforce the great principles of rebgion and justice; or, if the chief was within a moderate distance, he has personahy visited and reasoned with him; and these appeals have generaby produced the desired effect. A sbigle case may serve as an ibustration. A native, whose services Mr. Free man had hired, complained to liim, that he had"], [337, "309 CHAPTER XI. received some ih-treatnient from an old chief. Mr. Freeman immediately sent for him, and reasoned with him on account of his conduct; hut for some time he remained unmoved, and asked, \" What did it matter ? the man was only a slave.\" At length, however, he admitted the force of Mr. Freeman's arguments, and acknow ledged that he was wrong; and Mr. Freeman remarked, that he was at a loss to say which most dehghted him, the becoming manner in which the chief offered an apology, or the truly Chris tian spirit in which it was accepted by the complainant. By pursuing such a course, the Missionaries have the gratification to perceive, that juster views are finding their way into the pubbe mind on the relations which one man sustains to another in society. And it is only in this way that any effectual change can be accomphshed in the social condition of the peo ple. It is due to President Maclean to remark, that so far as British influence extends, it is employed by him in protecting the weak against the strong; but beyond the range of that influence, none but moral means can produce the desned improvement in the condition, as web as in the character, of the natives. Interesting as this mission appears, when viewed in its beneficial effects upon the natives of the"], [338, "310 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Gold Coast, it, however, rises in importance when regarded as the means by which a way has been opened, it is hoped, for the introduction of the Gospel into Ashantee (As-hanti). Its establish ment has served to excite more particular attention to the circumstances and spnitual wants of the people of that country; and has created facilities for bringing the claims of Chris tianity under the consideration of their sove reign. In contemplating the commencement of a mission to Ashantee, the attention is arrested by one of those coincidences which it may not be presumption to regard as arrangements of Divine Providence in preparation for the spread of the Gospel in Heathen countries. The mission to the Gold Coast was undertaken, after a long and desolating war, or rather succession of wars, when peaceful intercourse had but recently been restored between that coast and Ashantee ; and two youths of the royal famfly, Quantamissah and Ansah, whom the king had sent as hos- tages to Cape-Coast Castle, were among the first who enjoyed the advantages of Missionary instruction. Under the faithful ministry of Mr. Dunweb, they both became convinced of the truth and excebence of the Christian rebgion; the pubbe profession of which they have since assumed in England; \u2014 Quantamissah receiving"], [339, "311 CHAPTER XI. in baptism the name of Wilham, and Ansah, that of John. These two interesting youths \u2014 - having completed their education, under the direction of the African Committee, by whom the British Government now conducts the affairs of the Gold Coast ; and having visited the principal places in Great Britain and Ireland, under the care of the Rev. Mr. Pyne, a clergyman of the Estabbshed Church \u2014 are now returning to the Gold Coast, with the Niger Expedition, fobowed by the best wishes of ab who are interested in the cause of Africa. Shortly after the formation of the Cape-Coast mission, Christian worship was introduced into the capital of Ashantee, by some of the na tive Christians from the coast ; and one indi vidual, especiahy, obtained the favourable notice of the king himself. On the 17th of October, 1836, Mr. Wrigley, in writing to the Wesley an Committee, remarked : \u2014 \"The present king of the Ashantee nation, I have learned, is a far more tolerant man than his predecessor ; and a Missionary might, with perfect safety, reside at Coomassie, the capital of his kingdom. A young man is now resident there as the king's writer, or secretary, under the direction of the President of Cape-Coast, who formerly was a member of our society here ; and who continues, as far as I can learn, to maintain"], [340, "312 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. a moral and steady character, and is steadfast in his rebgious attachments.\" On the 11th of January fobowing, Mr. Wrigley again wrote as fobows : \u2014 \" I have just seen, at our preaching this even ing, one of our members, who has resided at Coomassie for some time past. He states to me, that in the house where he dwelt, he has several times bad the sons of the king of Ashantee (As-hanti) with him at prayers ; and that, on Christmas-day, the king requested their attend ance at the palace, when he, in conjunction with one or two others, had singing and prayer in the presence of the monarch.\" To this important field for Missionary enter prise the attention of Mr. Freeman was naturally directed; and he resolved to embrace the first favourable opportunity for exploring it. At length, having completed the erection of a chapel at Cape- Coast, and made the necessary arrange ments for the arduous undertaking, he placed the mission-house and societies under the care of Mr. Wilham De Graft, and on the 29th of January, 1839, set out for Coomassie, (Kumasi,) with his interpreter and attendants ; among whom were two native soldiers, provided by President Maclean, to whose kindness he was also indebted for a letter of introduction to the king of Ash antee (As-hanti). The zeal manifested by the"], [341, "CHAPTER XI. 313 native converts on this occasion deserves especial notice. As Mr. Freeman was the only Engbsh Missionary on the coast, it was no ordinary sacrifice on their part to relinquish the benefit of his sendees for a period of several months ; but, in addition to this, they bberaby contri buted nearly sixty pounds sterling, to meet in part the expenses of his journey. This noble instance of self-denial and bberabty, in behalf of the people who had for a length of years been the bitterest foes of their own country, is striking evidence, that an element altogether new had been introduced by Christianity into the African character, in which a feeling of kindness and compassion for enemies had not previously had a place. The day after crossing the river Prah, Mr. Freeman reached Quisah, the first town in Ashantee Proper ; and here he was informed, that he could not proceed any further without the consent of the chief of Adansi, who resided about a mile distant, at a neat little town cabed Fomunah. As it was then evening, and he had the unexpected pleasure of meeting with several Fantee traders there, who were members of the Wesleyan society at Cape Coast, he resolved to take up his quarters at Quisah for the night, and proceed to Fomunah in the morning. On the fobowing day, the chief Korinchi received p"], [342, "314 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. him with the etiquette generally observed on such occasions ; \u2014 sitting under his large umbrella, in the front of his house, sup. ported by his captains on the right hand and on the left. After the usual salutations had been exchanged, the chief inquired what object Mr. Freeman had in view, in visiting Coomassie; to which he repbed, that he had nothing to do with any palavers, nor was he engaged in any kind of trade ; but that his sole object was to explain and recommend the Christian rebgion, as the best means of promoting the highest interests of both the king and his people. The chief then expressed a desire to hear the Gospel for himself; and Mr. Freeman, in compbance with his wish, explained to him the scriptural doctrine of the One true God, and gave a summary of the leading truths of Christianity. On the fobowing day, which was the sabbath, Mr. Freeman, accompanied by the chief of Qui sah, again visited Fomunah, at the request of Korinchi, who wished to have further information ou the subject of the new rebgion. About five hundred persons assembled, and a regular reli gious service was held; during which the native members of the mission from Cape Coast, who were then on a trading excursion in the neighbourhood, united in shiging the praises of"], [343, "CHAPTER XI. 315 Almighty God. Great seriousness was manifested while Mr. Freeman discoursed on an appropriate passage of Scripture ; and frequently the truths which he debvered were assented to by an audible \" Yes \" from many of his hearers. At the conclu sion, the clues and the captains said it was \"a good palaver ; \" and Korinchi said he was anxious to hear more; and wished to be particularly informed what Yankumpon (\"God\") liked, and what he disliked. He appeared much pleased, when Mr. Freeman expressed his readiness to preach to him again; and both he and his cap tains were evidently disposed to infer the excel lence of the Christian rebgion, from the zeal which had prompted the Missionary to make such great sacrifices, merely for the purpose of doing them good. In a day or two, the Chief sent for him again ; and an officer arrived from Coomassie, (Kumasi,) with a present for him from the king, of nine ackies of gold, in value two pounds, five shillings, and a friendly message, informing him, that he should be invited to proceed in a few days, during which time the messenger would remain with him. Mr. Freeman then accepted the offer of Korinchi, to remove to Fomunah, and await there the final determination of the king ; and he was once more strictly interrogated as to the object of his visit, in order that the king p 2"], [344, "316 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. might have the fullest possible information upon the subject. A messenger was immediately des patched to Coomassie, with the answers which were obtained ; and Mr. Freeman embraced the opportunity of sending by him to the king the introductory letter which he had received from President Maclean. Whfle Mr. Freeman remained at Fomunah, he had opportunities of witnessing the effects of the popular superstitions. The fetishmen took the alarm at his coming, and attempted to excite the apprehension of impending eril ; and on one occasion, he noticed, that the path leading from Quisah to Fomunah was strewed with a fetish preparation of eggs and other materials, for the aheged purpose of preventing the town from destruction by fire. The occurrence of two deaths about the same time was also the occa sion of manifesting the sanguinary character of the false religion which enthrals the minds of the natives. On each of those events, a human being was sacrificed, with the usual ceremonies ; and the entire indifference manifested by the people at the sight of the mangled victims lying in the streets, strikingly evidenced their fami liarity with such scenes of horror. Mr. Freeman did not fail to remonstrate with the chief, on account of those proceedings ; and the answer which he received, in extenuation of the drunk-"], [345, "CHAPTER XI. 317 \u2022enness and riothig which took place at the funeral custom, afforded a striking verification of the apostohc description of those who \" sorrow \" for the dead as persons \" which have no hope.\" Korinchi said, that they felt very unhappy when they lost then\" relatives and friends, and were then glad to have recourse to drunkenness, or anything which would drive away their gloomy thoughts. On the fobowing sabbath, he and his captains manifested much excitement when Mr. Freeman discoursed to them on the Ten Com mandments; and appeared to be painfully affected, on being assured, in answer to one of their questions, that the offering of human sacri fices is murder in the sight of God. Six weeks having elapsed from the time of his arrival at Quisah, Mr. Freeman began to be very uneasy on account of his detention. The Chris tian societies on the coast needed his services ; the rainy season was so nearly approaching, as to leave bttle more than the necessary time for the journey to Coomassie, (Kumasi,) and back again to Cape Coast ; and there was no fairer prospect of his being allowed to proceed, than on the first day of his arrival. Korinchi met ab his inquiries with evasive answers, or fair promises which were not performed; and he at length packed up his luggage, and set out on his return. When the chief found, that the Missionary was really"], [346, "318 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. gone, he became greatly alarmed; and sent two or three persons after him, to assure him, that if he would go back to Fomunah, he would with out delay provide messengers to accompany him to Coomassie. Not being satisfied as to the sin cerity of the chief, he continued his homeward course ; when Korinchi apphed to a Fantee trader, then resident at Quisah, with whom Mr. Freeman was web acquainted, begging him to fobow the Missionary, and entreat him to return. He, however, still deemed it advisable to proceed, tib he came to a smab croom, about nine mdes from Fomunah, and there remain tfll the fobowing morning. Scarcely had he halted, when several other messengers arrived, stating that Korinchi was very unhappy, and that their hves would be in danger, should the Missionary leave the coun try. And it was the fact, that Korinchi was thrown into such a state of apprehension, that he made a \" custom,\" and spent the whole of that night in drinking and dancing, in order to banish gloomy apprehensions from his mind. The messengers, moreover, skOfuby urged the benevolent object of his visit ; and told him, that his kind intentions to promote the welfare of their countrymen would be defeated, should he now abandon his undertaking, and go back to the coast. Mr. Freeman was at length convinced, that the"], [347, "319 CHAPTER XI. chief did seriously intend to send him forward, without further delay, into the immediate vicinity of the capital, where he might remain untb he received the king's permission to tint him. In in the morning, therefore, he returned to Fomu nah ; which place he had scarcely entered, when a messenger arrived from the capital, accom panied by two or three persons whom Korinchi had sent in haste, to inform the king that the Missionary would not wait any longer, but was determined to return home, unless he might immediately go forward to Coomassie (Kumasi). The messenger brought a request from the king, that Mr. Freeman would proceed at once to the capital; and on the fobowing day he com menced his journey. The principal cause of the tedious delay which he experienced at Fomunah, was not the caprice or unwillingness of Korinchi, but the apprehensions of the king himself. Spies were placed at Fomunah, to watch his conduct ; and messengers were frequently sent up to report his daby proceedings. The fobowing dialogue between the king and one of the messengers, on his return to the capital, wib sufficiently indi cate the anxious fears which the barbarian monarch entertained : \u2014 The King.\u2014 -You have seen the fetishman? (meaning Mr. Freeman.)"], [348, "320 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST, Messenger. \u2014 Yes. King. \u2014 Had he plenty of drums with him? Messenger. \u2014 I saw no drums. King. \u2014 Why ! he is a fetishman : he must have drums with him. Messenger. \u2014 I saw no drums. He has plenty of boxes ; but I cannot say what they contain. King. \u2014 Why did you not endeavour to learn whether the boxes contained drums or not ? At another tune the king said, \" Never since the world began has there been an Engbsh Missionary in Ashantee before. What can he want?\" \u2014 What an affecting scene is disclosed by such inquiries and remarks ! In the ineffec tual endeavours of the king to comprehend the object of the missionary's visit, a striking proof is afforded that the human mind may be so darkened and depraved by the practice of idol atry, as to appear utterly unable, at first, even to form a conception of the disinterested compas sion of the Gospel. To obtain time for the sub consideration of the question respecting the probable object and tendency of a visit unpa ralleled in the annals of the country, was, doubt less, the principal reason for the delay which took place. The king was not wflhng to treat the white fetishman with discourtesy by send ing him away; for who could teb the power of his wraths and, on the other hand, he did not"], [349, "321 CHAPTER XI. dare to abow him to advance to the capital until he had pondered web the probable consequences of his approach. A somewhat simbar feeling of anxious curiosity was manifested by the peo ple generahy; for, as Mr. Freeman passed along the path, ab the inhabitants of the towns and crooms crowded together to gaze at him; but, whenever they saw him engaged with his attend ants in rebgious worship, they immediately ran away evidently in great alarm. When he arrived at Esargu, about nine miles from the capital, he waited until he should receive another message inviting him to proceed. He spent the sabbath there with out any summons, for the king had been made aware that the Christian missionary did not travel on that sacred day. Parties of soldiers, however, were seen passing towards the capital ; and, during the whole of the ensuing night, the tinkling of the bttle bells, attached to the dress of the military, announced the approach of successive detachments of troops, who were to take part in the formabties of Mr. Freeman's pub be reception. On Monday morning, about eight o'clock, he reached Franfraham, a bttle croom which had been buflt for the accommodation of persons travelling to Coomassie (Kumasi); and, whbe waiting there, under the influence of feelings which none can fully comprehend p 5"], [350, "322 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. but the faithful minister of Christ, and oppressed by a sense of the solemn responsibility which attached to him, as the first herald of the gos pel who had ever entered the dark and blood stained capital of Ashantee for the purpose of offering to its monarch and his people the rebgion of purity and peace, \u2014 he united with bis Christian native attendants in fervent prayer, that the blessing of the God of missions might prosper bis pious enterprise. About two o'clock in the afternoon a royal messenger arrived, requesting him to proceed; and, almost immediately after, three other officers, bearing gold-hflted swords, fobowed, for the pur pose of hastening hint. Preceded by the mes sengers, and by a party of soldiers carrying arms, he advanced nearly to the entrance of the capital ; and there, in accordance with African etiquette, waited, under a large tree, for a further invitation from the sovereign. In a short time Apoko, the king's chief bnguist, one of the most influential men in the kingdom, came bi his palanquin, shaded by au immense umbreba, and attended by several officers, bearing gold-headed canes, who took charge of the travelbng luggage, and conveyed it to the place provided for the tem porary residence of the stranger. Another messenger, accompanied by an escort of troops, and by men bearing large umbrebas, then arrived,"], [351, "CHAPTER XI. 323 with an invitation to the visitant to meet the king in the market-place. As they en tered the capital, Mr. Freeman noticed that he passed between two heaps of earth, newly thrown up, one on each side of the road ; but it was web for him that he did not learn, at that exciting moment, what those heaps concealed; for they were the graves of two human beings who had been just buried alive, as fetish victims, with a view to avert any eril that might, without such precaution, result from his visit. This appalling fact, afterwards ascertained by his interpreter, a Christian native, whose veracity was above suspicion, tends to throw fresh bght upon the cause of Mr. Freeman's long detention on the frontier; at the same time that it exhi bits, in a striking point of view, the feaiful character of those superstitions with which the Christian Missionary in Ashantee wbl have to contend. On arriving at the market-place, the imposing scene which the court of Ashantee (As-hanti) pre sents, burst sub upon his view. There sat the king, surrounded by his officers of state, his cabo ceers, and captains, and attended by a veiy large body of nblitary, and many thousands of other persons without arms. The whole number pre sent was estimated at forty thousand. A narrow path leading to the king was kept open, and Mr,"], [352, "324 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. Freeman was occupied half an hour in saluting the caboceers as he passed along, before he reached the royal presence. Having paid his respects to the king, by whom he was graciously received, it then became Mr. Freeman's privilege, or rather task, to receive the salutations of the sovereign and his court in return. Attended by his own people, and by some respectable Fantee traders who happened at that time to be in Coomassie, he accordingly placed himself in a convenient situation, at a little distance. The caboceers successively greeted him, as they passed with their bands of music, umbrebas, and every variety of fantastic ornament. The king, whose immediate suite made an astonishing display of gold, followed by the war-captains, and the troops, closed this striking exhibition of barbarous splen dour. It was a sub hour and a half before the gorgeous pageant passed away, and left the Missionary to his meditations. What his* reflections were, his own language wib best declare : \u2014 \" I gazed on this concourse of Heathens with feelings of sorrow and joy. I sorrowed in the reflection, that most (perhaps ab) of them were totaby ignorant of the. great Author of their being, without oue ray of divine consolation to cheer them amid the changing scenes of this visionary world. Are they laid on a bed of Ian-"], [353, "CHAPTER XI. 325 guishing? They have nothing to comfort them, or buoy up then drooping spirits. Does death, which stalks through the land in horrid forms, rob them of their friends ? Alas for them ! they must sorrow as men without hope. They never hear the shouts of departing Christian friends, as they ascend the steep of the heavenly Zion, to join the church triumphant above. Neither do they see, with the eye of faith, the blood-bought throng standing in the presence of God, 'clothed with white robes and palms in their hands.' Does death stare themselves in the face, and ask the panting breath ? Alas for them ! they have no Christian hope beyond the grave, bloom ing with immortahty ! Is it not so ? Teb it, ye murdered human victims, whose blood dis figures the streets, and whose putrefying bodies taint the air ! Teb it, ye midnight revebers, who vainly strive to draw the anguish from your hearts by the fumes of intoxication ! Teb it, ye carnivorous birds, and ye wbd beasts of the forest, that feed on the mangled corpses of the thousands of victims of superstitious cruelty ! And, lastly, teb it, ye human bones, that be bleaching in tbe open day ! \" On tbe third day after his arrival, Mr. Free man was visited by the royal linguists, some of whom were heavily laden with golden orna ments. They had been sent by the king to"], [354, "326 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. obtain from the Missionary sub information as to the object of his visit. \" I gave them,\" says Mr. Freeman, \" ab necessary information ; but found much difficulty in making them under stand me. And no wonder; for how can those who are buried in superstition, and who witness scarcely anything but scenes of cruelty arising from that superstition, form any just idea of the motives which stimulate the Christian Missionary to visit them ? \" The important negotiation was now suspended by one of those painful events which are ever and anon interrupting the course of affairs, and putting a stop to ab business among these unhappy people. On the morning after this visit from the linguists, Mr. Freeman learned that one of the king's relatives was dead, and that already four human victims had been sacri ficed, whose mangled carcases were lying in the streets ; and, in the course of the day, he received a message from the king, through Apoko, who had intimated the Missionary's anxiety to return as soon as possible to Cape Coast, requesting him not to go out into the town that day, as he was making a \" custom \" for a deceased relative, and he knew that Europeans did not bke to witness human sacrifices. Apoko was attended by two officers, one of whom carried an immense golden sword, to which was fastened a decanter"], [355, "CHAPTER XI. 327 of the same precious metal, winch would contain about a pint. He was, however, assured, that the king was now fully satisfied that the object of bis visit was only to do good, and would see him upon the subject as soon as the custom was over. In the course of that day, twenty-five human victims were sacrificed in tbe capital and surrounding vibages; the heads of those who were kbled in the suburbs were brought into the town in baskets ; and the work of slaughter was renewed, at the sound of the death-drum, on the fobowing day, when about fifteen more unfortunate creatures perished. The carcases, after having been exposed for some tune in the streets, were thrown into a deep deb on one side of the market-place, from which a most intolerable stench proceeded, as Mr. Free man passed the place on a subsequent day. In the midst of these scenes of horror, Mr. Freeman sanctified the Christian sabbath by conducting pubbe rebgious worship at his own quarters, which was attended by many Ashantees, some of whom manifested deep attention. Having received a handsome present from the king, consisting of a cow, a sheep, a pig, a quan tity of palm-nuts, yams, and plantains, and one ounce and five ackies of gold-dust, (\u00a35 currency,) with three ackies for his interpreter, and five for his other attendants, Mr. Freeman went to"], [356, "328 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. the palace to return his thanks for the present; but the business of his visit could not be entered upon until the funeral \"custom\" was over. In the meantime he employed himself in examining the capital, and visiting Bantama. His being per mitted to see the royal sepulchre at the latter place, must be regarded as a decided proof of the favourable impression which the king had received respecting him ; for the standing rule is, that no persons shah be allowed to go to Bantama, save when the king himself visits the tombs of his ancestors. The \" custom \" continued for a whole week, at the expiration of which, Mr. Freeman, having walked out for recreation, passed the end of a street where a great number of persons were assembled, and a band of music was playing ; and the horri fying exhibition of another human victim, welter ing in its gore, presented itself to his view. Turning from the affecting sight, he passed on to the further end of the same street, where he also found a large concourse of people, among whom, seated under his umbreba, was the king, who had come out to drink palm-wine publicly with his chiefs, previously to a week's partial seclusion in the palace after the \"custom\" had ended. In the course of this day, Mr. Freeman reminded Apoko of his anxiety to obtain an"], [357, "CHAPTER XI. 329 answer from the king respecting the estabbsh ment of schools, and other contemplated arrange ments for the benefit of the Ashantee people; when Apoko said, \"The king wib speedby give you an answer; and we hope you wib come to Coomassie (Kumasi) again, and pay us another visit, and we shab be always glad to see you. The king beheves that you wish to do him and the people good.\" On the second day after this conversation, Mr. Freeman, when in com pany with Apoko, adverted again to the ap proaching rains, which would render his speedy departure necessary ; and Apoko, who is the only subject that possesses the privilege of visiting the king whenever he pleases, went immediately to the palace, and returned with a message to the effect, that the monarch had been so busby engaged throughout the morning, that he could not see him shut day, but would make arrangements with him for his departure, on the morrow. The fobowing day, however, was the sabbath, on which Mr. Freeman again conducted divine service at his quarters ; and a most encouraging scene was exhibited. A native of the interior, who had received instruction from some of the Christian Fantee traders, had appbed for baptism, and was found to be so web acquainted with the doctrines of the Gospel, and manifested such a"], [358, "330 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. desire to become a disciple of Christ, that Mr. Freeman felt justified in admitting him into the Christian church by that sacred ordinance, which he did in the presence of many Ashantees. On the morning of Monday, Apoko, who had gone to the palace to remind the king, that it was necessary for Mr. Freeman to set out on his journey home, returned, accompanied by a great number of linguists and other attendants, with a present for the Missionary of two ounces and four ackies of gold-dust, (nine pounds cur rency,) and of a slave ; and with two pounds currency for his interpreter, and other attend ants. Apoko, at the same time, debvered the fol lowing message : \u2014 \" His Majesty knows that you cannot stop longer, on account of the rains ; and as the thing which you have mentioned to him reqinres much consideration, he cannot answer you in so short a time : but if you wib come up again, or send a messenger, after the rains are over, he wbl be prepared to answer you.\" In reply, Mr. Freeman engaged that either himself would return to Coomassie, or send a messenger at the time appointed ; and he then repaired to the palace to take leave of the king, who sat surrounded by a great number of attend ants ; and who, on parting with him, pobtely requested him to present his (the king's) com pliments to lbs Excebency, President Maclcan."], [359, "CHAPTER XI. 331 About noon the same day, after an affectionate fareweb from Apoko, who had acted throughout a most friendly part, he left Coomassie, preceded by an escort of soldiers, who accompanied him as far as Franfraham. At this place, Mr. Freeman halted awhile to perform what he felt to be a pleasing duty, namely, to emancipate the slave which had been presented to him by the king. The history of this poor creature, though brief, was eventful. He had been sent down from the interior to Coomassie, and was placed among the slaves, about one thousand ia number, whom the king keeps in irons to be ready for sacrifice. During the \" custom \" which had just taken place he had been twice brought out for execution, but as often his fetters had been placed upon him again, and he had been sent back into confinement ; and on that morning, on which he was taken out to be presented to Mr. Freeman, he fuhy expected that the fatal day had at length arrived, and that he should then be sacrificed. Mr. Freeman is of opinion, that, as he was a web-proportioned, good- looking man, the king had reserved him as a more worthy present than a mean and ib-looking person would have been. After the joyous scene of his emancipation had taken place, the Missionary pursued his journey to Fomunah, where Korinchi, overjoyed to see him, threw his arms round his"], [360, "332 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. neck, and gave him the most affectionate wel come ; and when, on parting again, Mr. Freeman told him that he should need his assistance in forwarding messengers to Coomassie, or in fur nishing himself with aid on a second visit, he readily promised to do everything for him which might be in his power, and afforded at once a substantial proof of bis kindness, by providing four strong men to assist him across the hihs of Adansi, on his homeward road. On the evening of the 23d of April, Mr. Freeman arrived at Cape-Coast Castle, after an absence of nearly three months.* The results of this important journey were as encouraging as could have been reasonably anti cipated. The long delay of Mr. Freeman at * Mr. Freeman's own Journal of his visit was published at length in the Missionary Notices of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, for the month of January, 1840 ; and also in the General Report of that Society for the same year. To that most interesting Document the Reader is respectfully referred for full particulars. The preceding abridgment of its contents it was deemed expedient to introduce into this volume, in order to furnish a brief, but complete and connected, view of the religious state and prospects of Ashantee, as well as to secure the sympathies, the prayers, and the continued and persevering liberality of the Christian and benevolent Public of this country, in behalf of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, which has had the truly apostolical honour of making the fikst move ment towards the establishment of one of the most needed, but most difficult and perilous, Missions of modern times."], [361, "CHAPTER XI. 333 Fomunah, however perplexing at the time, was doubtless productive of very beneficial effects. It tended to make him well known on the borders of Ashantee, (As-hanti,) and afforded him the opportunity of attaching to himself a considerable number of friends, among whom he can place himseb with confidence, when he shall again go up to the capital. Fomunah will be a kind of advanced post, which wib facilitate his future missionary arrangements with respect to the interior. It was at that place tbat he par tiaby succeeded in producing a favourable im pression upon tbe mind of the king himself, who was encouraged, by the frequent reports which he received as to his spirit and conduct, so far to renounce his superstitious apprehensions, as to give him a cordial welcome to the capital. The sovereign's personal intercourse with Mr. Free man there, strengthened the good opinion of him which he had formed, and even produced a wish to detain him much longer than it would have been convenient for him to stay ; for Mr. Free man is of opinion, that the king would not have parted with him so soon, had it not been for the considerate kindness of President Maclean, who wrote to explain to him the danger to which the health and bfe of the Missionary would be exposed, should he not leave before the rains set in, as he had not made the necessary precau-"], [362, "334 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. tionary arrangements for spending the rainy sea son in Coomassie. That Mr. Freeman was not deceived in his opinion, as to the good effect of his visit, was rendered apparent in a few weeks after his return to the coast ; for he received a communication, stating, that the king was waiting to see him again, and was anxious that he should estabbsh a school at. Coomassie (Kumasi). And his hope, as to the success of his future under taking, was greatly strengthened by the cir cumstance that several Ashantees, who came down on business to Cape-Coast Castle, cabed at the mission-house to see him, and recognised him as an old friend. Among these was a brother of Korinchi, who presented to him that Chief's regards, and told him, that they should ab be happy to receive from him another visit. The impression of Mr. Freeman as to the character of the favourable opening into Ash antee, was considerably confirmed by the opinion of a very competent judge of African temper and character. Having submitted the journal of his torn\" to President Maclean, his Excebency, on sending it back, thus expressed his views : \u2014 \" I herewith return your narrative of your journey to Ashantee, (As-hanti,) which I have perused with very great interest. \" I would fain hope that, from the manner in"], [363, "335 CHAPTER XI. which you were received in your avowed character as a Missionary, throughout the whole of your arduous journey, there wib not exist many obsta cles to the accompbshment of the first object, \u2014 getting a locus standi in the country. Certainly I think there wib be no insuperable obstacle. \" I hope and trust that the Wesleyan Mission ary Committee wib be satisfied, that there is such an Opening as wbl justify them in pushing the advantage gained by your indefatigable zeal. I would almost go so far as to say, that, if they have the means, a serious responsibility wib rest upon them, and on Christian England, if so glorious an opening into interior Africa, if so rich a har vest, be neglected. But I hope better things. And I do not despair of yet witnessing the peace ful triumph of the Cross, even in that stronghold of Satan, Coomassie. \" I expect that considerable advantages will arise from the Christian education of the two Ashantee Princes, now in England. If well sup ported, for ab depends upon that, then- influence in Ashantee wib aid the good cause much. I shah not fab to take care that they be introduced to the Wesleyan Missionary Committee.\" It is due to J. G. Nichobs, and W. M. Hutton, Esquires, leading members of the Committee for managing the affairs of the Settlements at the Gold Coast, to state that they had already kindly"], [364, "336 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. introduced members of the Wesleyan Missionary Society to the acquaintance of the Princes, and that they have ever taken a hvely interest in the Society's Mission at the Gold Coast, as an important means, in their' judgment, for pro moting the improvement of that part of Africa. On the receipt of Mr. Freeman's Journal in England, the question, \" What shah be done ? \" became the subject of grave consideration on the part of the Wesleyan Missionary Committee, under whose direction Mr. Freeman acted. The ordinary annual income of the Society was already pledged for the support of existing missions ; and yet the Committee dared not to take upon them selves the responsibility of refusing to attempt, at least, the establishment of a mission in Ashan tee. It was at length resolved, that Mr. Freeman should be allowed to return home for a time, partly for the purpose of recruiting his health, but more particularly with a view to a special effort being made, in order to raise the funds necessary for the new undertaking ; and two Mis sionaries were immediately sent to relieve him, for a time, from his laborious duties at the Gold Coast. On the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Mycock, and Mr. Brooking, Mr. Freeman, therefore, came to England, accompanied by Mr. Wilham De Graft, and was the bearer of a message from the king of Ashantee, who requested that his"], [365, "CHAPTER XI. 337 two nephews might be immediately sent home, \u2014 the contemplated establishment of a Christian school at Coomassie having rendered him very anxious to see them. The results of Mr. Freeman's visit to several of the principal towns in Great Britain and Ireland have been of the most gratifying descrip tion. Members of the Church of England, some of whom are in the higher walks of life, and Christians of other religious denominations, as web as the members of the Wesleyan community, responded to the novel and deeply-interesting appeal; and, by these united exertions, the pro posed sum of j65,000 was placed at the disposal of the Wesleyan Committee, to enable them to send with Mr. Freeman, on his return, Six addi tional Missionaries, in order to strengthen the existing estabbshments at the Gold Coast, and to commence a new mission in the kingdom of Ashantee. Arrangements were made in due season for their outfit and departure ; and, at Mr. Freeman's suggestion, the Committee agreed so far to comply with the estabbshed African cus tom of offering presents, as to send for the king's acceptance and use a suitable carriage, which was noticed with approbation by Her Most Gra cious Majesty and His Royal Highness Prince Albert, to whose inspection it was submitted by Mr. Sims, the bmlder. In the month of Decem- Q"], [366, "338 ASHANTEE. AND THE GOLD COAST. ber, Mr. and Mrs. Freeman embarked at Graves end, on board the \" Osborne,\" accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Hesk, Mr. and Mrs. Shipman, Messrs. Watson, Walden, and Thackwray, and Mr. Wilham De Graft, whom the Committee had received as a regular agent of the Society, to be hereafter whoby employed in the work of the Mission ; and, after a few days, the party left the Channel, fobowed by the best wishes and ardent prayers of thousands who have become deeply interested in their arduous enterprise. CONCLUSION. In adverting to the probable results of the projected Mission in Ashantee, it may be fairly anticipated, that, should the Divine blessing crown it with success, it wib have an important bearing on the work of the moral illumination and social elevation of Africa ; an object to which the pubbe attention is now so especiaby directed, and for whose attainment such a combination of ener gies have been cabed forth, and so many ardent prayers have been offered, by *>those who have. learned from the volume of inspiration, that, without the benediction of God, \" nothing is> wise, or strong, or good.\" It is presumed that the preceding pages fur-"], [367, "339 CHAPTER XI. nish evidence in support of the views so strongly expressed by that enlightened phbanthropist, Sir T. Foweb Buxton, on the primary importance of Christianity. Great as is the stress which he lays on the application of subordinate means, such as the promotion of agriculture, and the intro duction of a lawful and healthful commerce ; yet one of the principles, to which most prominence is given in his spirit-stirring volume, is, that the Gospel is the great civibzer of barbarous men, and that the exertions of the Missionary are therefore of indispensable necessity.* And can any one, possessed of a competent knowledge of the super stitions of Ashantee, hesitate to adopt this con clusion? Is an improved system of agriculture to be introduced? The risible representatives of the gods of the people are growing upon the very spot where the experiment is to be at tempted. Are the natives to be taught to work the invaluable mines with which then\" coun try abounds? It wbl be found that the hills which contain the precious treasures are the imaginary residences of the national deities, and that superstition wib deprecate the sacrilegious touch. Are the advantages of an innocent com merce to be recommended ? Yes ; but the inter vention ofthe numerous \"unlucky days,\" and the * \" The African Slave-Trade and its Remedy,\" p. 502. Q 2"], [368, "340 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. time necessary for the consultation of the Heathen oracles, before any important business can be undertaken, wib retard, and often entirely defeat, the best-concerted arrangements. Are remon strances to be addressed to the people, on account of their inhuman practices? The sacri fice of human victims is not inhumanity, in their estimation; but an act of piety most acceptable to then\" gods, and one of the best proofs which they can afford of their affection for departed relatives and friends. Even Osai Quamina, who lost his throne because he had ventured to abolish several other superstitious customs, did not dare to abandon the practice of human sacri fices at the graves of his relatives. Nor was such a reluctance an uncommon feeling. Very recently, the neighbouring king of Dahomy repbed, to a gentleman from Cape-Coast Castle,* (who expostulated with him on the occasion of a pubbe sacrifice,) that then* rebgious customs ren dered such offerings imperative, and that were he to forbid them, the dissatisfaction of the peo ple would place his own bfe in jeopardy. It may, therefore, be considered as certain, that, whatever may be done by other means in the way of faci litating the introduction of the Gospel, the work of civbization wib not be advanced to any consi- * Thomas Hutton, Esq."], [369, "CHAPTER XI. 341 derable extent, untb the superstitious speb by which the people are bound shab be broken by Christianity itself. When that, however, shab be once accompbshed, tbe happiest results may then be expected to fobow. The influence which a successful evangelical mission in Ashantee (As-hanti) cannot fail to exert in promoting peaceful relations between that country and the British settlements on the coast, deserves especial notice. However it may be regretted that, in the former war of the coast, greater exertions were not made to meet those demands of the Ashantee king which possessed something of the character of jus- tice, it must yet be obvious, that it wib ever prove a most difficult task to prevent misun- derstandings with a people whose views and principles of action are so remote from those which prevail in civilized society ; and it may be concluded, that, unless a revolution be effected in the Ashantee character, bttle hope can be enter- tained of the continuance of peace. That such a conclusion is not to be regarded as a mere theo- retic opinion, unsupported by experience, wib appear from the fobowing extract of a letter addressed to the Rev. Mr. Mycock, on the 9th of April last, by President Maclean : \u2014 \"I am truly glad,\" bis Excebency remarks, \" that your Committee have taken up the subject"], [370, "342 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. of a mission to Ashantee as they have done. The experience of every succeeding year convinces me more and more, that, even in a pobtical point of view, the estabbshment of a mission, and of schools, in Ashantee, would be of infinite value; for these would eventuaby prove our truest and best safeguard against the revival of those quar rels and wars, betwixt the Ashantee and Fantee tribes, which, as matters at present stand, a very smab spark might rekindle. Although our rela tions with Ashantee have certainly been, for the last nine years, on a better footing than during any former period in the history of the colony ; yet they have been a constant subject of anxiety to me, knowing, as I do, the people with whom I have had to deal. I only hope, that as neither Mr. Freeman nor myself have ever attempted to undervalue or understate the difficulties which must be encountered in carrying Christianity and education into the ulterior, the Wesleyan Mission ary Committee wib not abow their zeal to be quenched, or their endeavours to slacken, when those obstacles come to be felt, and fought against.\" Assuredly the Committee did not resolve upon attempting the formation of a mission in Ashantee, but under the deep and solemn conviction of the arduous nature of the under taking. The formidable obstacle which an insalu-"], [371, "343 CHAPTER XI. brious climate opposes to Missionary labours in every part of Western Africa, wib prevail also in Ashantee to a great extent ; but that wib not be the worst feature of the case. Moral difficulties, of the most appabing character, must be en countered. Let the situation of the Mission aries be contemplated, when, far from civilized society, the almost every-day scenes with which they must become awfully familiar wib be those tragedies of barbarity and horror, at the bare recital of which the heart sickens ; and when frequently they must witness those outbursts of superstitious fury, during which scarcely any life is safe, \u2014 with the conviction, too, that them selves are peculiarly obnoxious to the priests, the demons who direct the storm, \u2014 let these circumstances be kept in view, and then it wib be understood how great an amount of moral courage and of divine support they wib require to sustain them at the post of duty. And who can tell to what an extent the indulgence of a bar barous caprice may not frustrate their exertions, and for a whfle disappoint their hopes? Mr. Freeman congratulated himself on having found a friend in Korinchi, the chief of Fomunah ; but his aid cannot be anticipated ; for Korinchi, having given some cause of offence, bas been destroyed with debberate cruelty, \u2014 the king having ordered a certain stream to be diverted from its channel,"], [372, "344 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. until a hole should be dug in its bed, in which that unfortunate chief was placed, and then left to perish in the returning waters of the rivulet. In debberating upon the formation of a mission in Ashantee, (As-hanti,) the Wesleyan Commit tee, the writer repeats, had a distinct conception of the formidable character of the undertaking. But unless they had renounced the first principles of our most holy rebgion, they could not avoid the conclusion, that it is the imperative duty of some section or other of the Christian church to send the Gospel even to Ashantee ; nor did they dare to deny that the indications of Provi dence imposed upon the particular Society which they represent, a special obbgation to make the attempt. Viewing the encouragement to exertion afforded in the success winch had been vouchsafed to the labours of their Missionaries on the coast, where, in the short space of five years, upwards of Six Hundred natives had been united together in Christian societies, and several Coloured Teachers had been raised up, a specimen of whom they had before them in the person of Mr. William De Graft; \u2014 considering what faci lities such a mission was calculated to afford for extending the gospel into the interior; \u2014 taking into account the fact, that the way had been partiaby opened by the successful visit of Mr."], [373, "CHAPTER XI. 345 Freeman to Ashantee, and that the king had expressed a wish that he should return and estab bsh a Christian school in the capital ; \u2014 and aware, moreover, that the Society had Missionaries at its disposal, who would not shrink from the peril of even such an undertaking ; \u2014 the Committee could not have justified themselves, nor would they, as the writer is persuaded, have been acquitted by the Christian pubbe of Britain, had they resolved that they would not \" at least attempt \" to estab lish a mission in Ashantee. In the prosecution of tins great work, the most strenuous and persevering exertions wib doubtless be necessary; for it is not to be expected, that the strong-hold of Heathenish darkness and supersti tion which the Missionaries have gone to assail, wbl be won in a day. Perhaps a long period may elapse before much visible impression may be pro duced. But if the necessary efforts be made and continued, in the spirit of prayer, and of humble dependence upon the Divine blessing, the pro mises of Holy Writ warrant the expectation of eventual success. In that regenerated world which is contemplated in the bright vision of prophecy, even Ashantee must be included ; and faith stead fastly anticipates the time when that vision shall become a debghtful reabty : \u2014 \" For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\" d 5"], [374, "NOTES.

Abu Bekr, having obtained his liberty by the kind intervention of Dr. Madden, accompanied Mr. Davidson to Africa ; when the caravan by which they were travelling from Wad-i-Nun to Tumbuktu, was attacked and plun dered by a party of Arabs, and Mr. Davidson lost his life and property together. Since that catastrophe, which occurred in December, 1836, Abu Bekr has not been heard of; but his former benefactor, Dr. Madden, has prepared an advertisement to be sent into the interior by the Niger Expedition, generously offering a reward of one hundred dollars, to any individual who may give such information respecting him, as may lead to his liberation, should he have been reduced a second time to slavery.

The reduction of the Kafir language to a written form, was a work of considerable labour ; and the first grammati cal sketches of it were so imperfect, that in some cases the exceptions to the rules were almost as numerous as the instances in which the rules applied. The Rev. William Shaw, the principal Wesleyan Missionary in Southern Africa, at length obtained the clue which enabled his col league, the Rev. W. B. Boyce, to trace out the principle on which the language is constructed. This has been termed the \" Euphonic or Alliteral Concord ; \" and it operates so extensively, and with such regularity, as to secure the greatest precision, while effectually promoting the harmony of the language. Whether or not the analogy- 's between it and the Coptic by Dr. Prichard, may be considered as a satisfactory indication of the origin of the"], [375, "NOTES, 347 people by whom it is used ; it will be obvious to all who examine carefully the structure of the Kafir language, tbat. it must originally have been the medium of communication among a people, who were possessed of a refinement and civilization altogether unknown in the extensive regions of Southern Africa, where the language, in its various dialects, is now spoken. A second and enlarged edition of Mr. Boyce's Grammar, prepared by the Rev. J. W. Davis, is now in the press ; and the Rev. H. Dugmore is compiling a Dictionary of the language. The Rev. James Archbell has also published a Grammar of the Sichuana, a kindred dialect. The Mis sionaries of the Society have translated into the Kafir language, and printed at the mission press in Graham's Town, nearly the whole of the sacred Scriptures ; and the agents of the London and Glasgow Missionary Societies have also diligently applied themselves to the work of translation in both languages. NOTE C\u2014 See page 161. That the Fiilahs of Senegambia were of a different origin from that of the Negro race, is not a novel opinion ; that they are identically the same people with the Fela tahs of central Africa, has been shown by Professor Vater, who, on comparing the Felatah Vocabulary which he obtained from Seetzen, with the list of Fulah words given by Barbot, found that they were the same language ; and recently M. Gustave D'Eichtal, in a paper whioh he read before the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in Paris, has endeavoured to prove, that all these tribes are of Malayan origin. His opinion is founded on a comparison of the Fulah language with the group of languages spoken in the Archipelago, to all of which it was found to bear many obvious affinities ; while it most closely resembles the Java tongue, from which source he supposes, that the Fulah derived a certain number of Sanscrit words, which it is said to contain. Their name Fulah, signifies \" white, in the Rotte dialect of the Archipelago ; and M. D'Eich tal supposes, that they may have adopted that name in"], [376, "348 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. confirmation of the tradition which they cherish, that they are descended from a race of white men. With this opinion respecting the Malayan origin of the Fulahs, the learned gentleman, however, appears to hold another, which is contradictory. He traces the settlement of the Fulahs in Africa to a very remote antiquity, and suggests that they may be the same people, who are designated in the ethnological table of the Book of Genesis, \" Phut,\" and placed after \" Kush\" and \" Misraim ;\" but if they are the descendants of Phut, then they are not of Shemitic origin, for Phut was the third son of Ham. (Gen. x. 6.) NOTE D.\u2014 See page 164, In prosecution of the philanthropic designs of Dr. Lindoe and his friends, in behalf of the Fulah tribes in the vicinity of the Gambia, the Wesleyan Missionary Society sent the Rev. Robert M. Macbrair to M'Carthy's Island, for the purpose of reducing to grammatical form, one or more of the principal languages of that part of Western Africa. Finding that the Fulahs generally understood the Mandingo tongue as well as their own, he prepared a Grammar of the Mandingo, and also made translations into that language, of the four Gospels, one of which transla tions \u2014 that of St. Matthew \u2014 has been printed by the liberality of the Committee of the British and Foreign Bible Society. With the view of giving further effect to the benevolent plans of Dr. Lindoe, the buildings of an Institution more especially designed for the education of the sons of native kings and chiefs, are now in the course of erection at M'Carthy's Island."], [377, "APPENDIX. 1. DESCRIPTION OF A SLAVE WAR. (See page 119.) This narrative was written by Joseph Wright, a member of the Wesleyan society at Sierra Leone. He cabs himself an Aku, the name by which natives of Eyeo, or Yarriba, are generaby known. The Document was received by tbe writer from the Rev. Thomas Edwards, a Mis sionary of the Society, on his return from Sierra Leone ; and no hberties have been taken with it except to expunge a few redundant expressions, and to introduce such sbght grammatical cor rections as may serve to make the meaning more apparent. I was horn Heathen in a Heathen land, and was trained up in my youth to the fashion and customs of that hea thenish country ; but the Lord, who will not have me to live to be old in that unhappy country, brought among us war and confusion as the wages of our sins. I was bom of respectable parents ; but they were not very rich. My father was a member of council, and he had two wives, besides those of his father, which he left to him at his death, according to the law of our country."], [378, "350 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. My mother was the first wife my father had, and she bore five children unto my father. We were all boys except one, and we all were with our parents until this last tumultuous war, which is the cause of our separation. The war had been heard of long ago ; but, at the time we heard of that war in a far distant land, we confidently thought, they will not come to us ; but, alas ! in space of about seven years after, they come to us unexpectedly, and besieged us round about. These people that raised up this war are not ano ther nation. We are all one nation, speaking one language. The war shut us up from all business ; our enemies fighting us with all their strength, and we fighting against them with all our might, but not with hope of escape. In this miserable state we lived for about seven months, almost destitute of food. We had nothing to eat, in order to have strength to fight our enemies. In this hard case of ours, we had no real God to go to for help, but we were constantly sacrificing. There is a god which we call the public god ; it is the god of man, and not of woman. No woman is ever allowed to go or pass by the mountain where they place that god. The name of that god was Korowah. To this we were all looking for help ; and to another, by name Turbertaru. This is woman's god ; the females often killing pigeons, fowls, and sometime bullocks, as sacrifice for their god. And these were to overcome the war which had besieged our city, besides thousands of private gods which the people kept in their houses. At last the famine overcame us, so that the chosen men of war could not forbear ; and one night, in about seven months after the war had besieged us, they consulted together to go to another place, in order to buy us some food, to preserve us children of the lqnd. And so they did ; and in this hand were my father and mother. They went to get us some food, too ; for they pitied us, when they saw us perishing with hun ger. At the time they left me and all my brethren, they knew not that they would never see us again in the flesh, or else they would never have left us, or they would have given us a final kiss, as dear children ; but they knew not what would take place after they left us. Short time after, they were gone, with all the mighty men of war. May be,"], [379, "APPENDIX. 351 the enemies knew this ; bo they got ready to take the city, before the people, who gone for food, should come back. The town had become very poor, for want of people to fight ; because the greater part of the people determined to go to seek food. The city was in danger of being taken every day, because there remained but women, and young men, and boys, in town. In the night, before the city was taken, the people were trying to make their escape ; and many did escape. When I heard of this, I took my brethren with me, and we came to the gate of the city, to make our escape, if possible. The gate was quite crowded, so that the strong were treading upon the feeble. Doubtless, there were many trodden upon to death ; and had I and my brethren attempted to go over the wall, we should have been trodden upon, and we should have died, the wall builded round the city was so high and strong ; and besides, there was a large and very deep ditch dig round behind the wall ; so that there was no way to pass, except through the gate ; and we obliged to come back, to our fathers house, there to remain, to see what would take place in the morning. 0 sorrowful, sorrowful morning ! When the morning come, I and my brethren took a walk about in the town, to see what the people were doing. We found the city in sorrowful silence ; for many had fled, and many of the aged men had put an end to their lives. Among these was one in our house, \u2014 my father's near and very dear relation : he had put an end to his life, too. His name was Ahkarlah : but since he became the chief priest of Korowah, the public god of man, his name was changed to Aboreh ; for so they call the chief priest of the city. His manner of dressing was remarkable : the day when he was going to officiate, he would put on all white, white garment, white cap, he would put on all white. He would be attended by all the other ministers, and all those whose office was to attend the ministers of the said god ; and when they were about to come out from the closet of the priest, warning would be given to the women in the yard, to hide ; and also warning would be given to the market-women, to hide themselves,"], [380, "352 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. or bow down their heads beneath their knees, or cover their faces with their handkerchief ; for they were not allowed to see the priest in his ministerial dress ; for if they did, they would die for it. They always remained very long when they carried the bull to sacrifice. And when they were coming, in the night, one would go before, giving warning, as perhaps there might be some women remaining in the streets. When this elderly relation of our father, whom we should have looked to for some guidance, had put an end to his life, of course, there remained no hope in ourselves. I brought my brethren back home. The enemy had fully taken the city. When I saw none of them pass by my father's house to take us for slaves, I then took my bre thren with me. We came out into the street ; and when we had walked about fifty fathoms from our house, we saw the city on fire, and before us were the enemies coming in the street. We met with them, and they caught us sepa rately. They separated me from all my brethren, except one of my father's children, born to him by his second wife ; I and this were caught together by one man. By the time we left the house of our father, I saw my father's mother pass the other gate : she and I had no hope of seeing her again in this flesh, because she was an old woman : doubtless, they would kill her. Many were killed. They killed our captain, Jargunor, by the river side. And they killed Barlah, in his gate. He was second to the king : he was a very high man in the city : nothing can be decided without his presence. The city was taken about nine o'clock in the morning. There were two cities beside our own, that those enemies had besieged. The same day our city was taken in the morning, and the other two were taken in the afternoon, about two o'clock. The enemies satisfied themselves with little children, little girls, young men, and young women. They did not care for the elderly, and old people : they killed them without mercy ; and then father knew not the son, and the son knew not the father ; pity had departed from the face of mothers. Abundant heaps of dead bodies were"], [381, "APPENDIX. 353 in the streets, and there was none to bury them ; suckling babes crying at the point of death, and there was none to take them up : the mothers looked upon them with neg lect. These three cities were consumed in one day, and many of the inhabitants were taken as slaves by the enemies. One of our chief men of war they punished severely ; his name was Ofersapu. In this manner they punished him. They first cut him in tender parts ; and after that, they put rope on his neck ; and then they dragged him about a quarter of mile, and put an end to his life. They took revenge on him, because he was valiant in fighting them. Very many of the chief men of war they punished more severely than I can mention. I was brought, the same day the city was taken, to Imodo, the place which they make their residence. When I came to that place, the man who seized me in the city, took me, and made a present of me to the chief man of war, which commanded the band which he belong to ; for the custom was, when any one of their company went with bands to war, if he catch slaves, half of the slaves he would give to his captain. I was with them in the camp about ten days ; during the time, they used to send me for fire wood. In one of the cities they took the same day they took our own, there I saw some people burned in the streets. They dug out many dead bodies from their graves, in order to take off their grave-clothes to sell for money ; for the manner of dressing the dead in that part of the world quite differs from this country. In this manner they dress the dead. If the dead person has been a man of fortune, the council would take all his valuable clothes, and dress him carefully, with all costly apparel ; the dress would make him about four feet high from the ground. Perhaps there would be about twenty large pieces of costly cloths, besides those that he lived in. And then they would make a large coffin, about five feet high, and about four feet wide, and properly dressed with all fine and costly cloths. After that, they would send for king's drum, or band ; and about twelve or fourteen men would take the coffin upon their shoulders, and one"], [382, "354 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. would stand before, giving out country hymn, and followed by thousands of people, singing after them. They would go round the city with the coffin, and then come back to the place where the dead person lay. After all this, the relations of the dead person would give warning to the council when the body should be buried ; and in the night, when the body was to be buried, the council's drum would beat. The market would be broken up in the evening, and they would come to the place where the body laid ; and abundant of apparel would be prepared to line the bottom of the tomb, and plenty of money would be laid in bottom of the grave ; and then they would lay the body of the dead upon these things, and cover him with dust. This is the way they bury the dead. We do not bury the dead out of the house, as they do in this country ; we bury a person in his own room ; but if the person has been a slave, we bury him in the square. The house where dead person is buried is not to be forsaken, but to be taken pos session of by another person. A dead body may remain for many years and not spoil. This is the cause why the enemy dug out dead bodies in order to take the money, and the fine clothes with which the bodies were dressed ; but this cannot be done unless the city is taken by the enemies. While I was with these enemies in the camp, I saw many wonderful instances, all which I cannot now mention. I saw a child of about eighteen months old, which was cast out of the camp because the child was too young, that nobody would buy him ; and that poor orphan was there crying, at the point of death, for about two days, and none to pity or take him up. Another time I took a walk about in the camp, when I saw my own brother. I was not allowed to speak to him, although they knew him to be my own brother. Few days after this, the person whom I then belonged to sent me home to his wife for sale ; and I was with his wife one day aud a half. She sent for a trade-man to examine me. They stripped me naked. The man examined me all over. They then went aside from me to make a bargain ; and in a few hours after tbat, tiie man came again, and my mistress told me to go with the man and fetch some rum. Just as I went out of"], [383, "APPENDIX. 355 her sight, the man stripped me of my clothes, and sent them to my mistress. Then I know that they only deceived me, by telling me to go with the man and fetch some rum. Then I went with this man, who had just bought me from my mistress. The man tried to feed me and make me clean as possible, for the next market-day ; one day out of six is generally market-day. One morning, at the cock crow, the man started me, for the following day would be market-day ; and when we come to the village near the place where the market was to be held the day after, we there slept ; it was then a late hour. Early in the morning we came to the market, where many hundreds of slaves. We were put in rows, so that we all could be seen at one view by the buyers ; and in about five hours another trade-man came and bought me, and put me in a canoe at once, and we were sailing all that night. Next morning we come to another slaves' market, by name Krodu, and there we remained the whole day ; for the man wanted to buy more slaves. At the time of the evening, the canoe was quite loaded with slaves, and we sailed for his home directly ; we arrived about twelve o'clock in the night. The town that we arrived at is Ikko, by name, the place where the Portuguese traded. Early in the morning we were brought to white Portu guese for sale ; after strict examination, the white man put me and some others aside ; after that, they then bargained how much he would take for each one of us. After they were well agreed, the white man sent us to the slave-fold ; and when we enter into it, the slaves shouted for joy for having seen another of their countryman in the fold. The articles which the Portuguese paid for slaves, were tobacco, rum, clothes, powder, gun, cutlasses, brass, iron-rod, and jaki, \u2014 that is our country money. The inhabitants of Ikko are very cruel people ; they would even sell the children of their own bosom. May God Almighty make bare his holy arm, in sending the Gospel to this benighted land ! I was there in the fold for about two months, with a rope on my neck. All the young boys have ropes on their"], [384, "356 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. necks in a row ; and all the men with chains in a long row, for about fifty persons in row ; so that no one could make escape without the other. At once the town took fire, and about fifty slaves were consumed ; because the entry was so crowded that these slaves could not get out. During the time I was in that cruel place, their king was very sick ; and the business of his attendants is to ask the diviner ; and whatsoever he commands to be done, for the recovery of the king's health, is immediately attended to. During the time of the king's sickness, the slaves often met with a goat or a sheep sacrificed, and money put on the top of the sacrificed beasts, to appease the god of their land. This money the slaves always took as good luck ; for the money generally amounted to two thousand jakis. This large sum of jakis they used to put upon the top of the sacrificed beasts ; and this one jaki is worth as much as English halfpenny. Alas ! the worthless prophets, with all their Ododowor and Obahtahlah, (for so they call their gods,) were not able to do any good for the king in regard to his recovery. Three days after his death, we came away over the river to prepare for shipping ; for their custom was, when the king died, to sacrifice about one thousand slaves for the celebration of the king's death ; for we sup posed at that time, if we still remained in that cruel town, and if the king's slaves should not be enough for the celebration of the king's death, doubtless, they would ask our master for some slaves to make up the number. We all believed this was what induced our master to bring us over the river in haste for shipping. The place that they brought us to it is Igayi, and we were all naked, both men and women ; so that we hardly had any rest in the night, for we were very cold. Next day, early in the morning, we were all brought down close to the salt water for to be put in canoes. We all were heavy and sorrowful in heart, because we were going to leave our land for another which we never knew ; and not only so, but when we saw the waves of the salt water on which we were just to enter, it discouraged us the more ; for we had heard that the Portuguese were going to eat us when we got to their country. This put us more to despair ; and"], [385, "APPENDIX. 357 when they began to place in canoes to bring us to the brig, one of the canoes sunk, and half of the slaves died. After they had done loading the brig, they stowed all the men at the bottom under the deck ; the boys and women were left on the deck. The brig sailed in the evening ; and one morning we saw an English man-of-war coming. When these Portuguese saw this, it put them to disquietness and confusion. They then told us, thai these are the people which would eat us, if we suffered them to prize us ; and they also enticed us, if they should ask us how long it was since we sailed, we must say it was more than a month ; and they also gave us long oars, and set us to pull, (about ten men set on one oar,) and we tried to pull as we were able ; but it was of no avail. Next day, the English vessel overtook us. and they took charge of the slaves. We were very poor for water ; we were only allowed one glass of water a day ; and we were allowed only breakfast, no dinner. Many of the slaves were dead for want of water, and many were dead through confinement. One day, as I sat by the fire-side, where they were cook ing, boiling water was thrown on my head, and my head all peeled, and this pained me very much. All the slaves thought I should have died. But the Lord nourished me in that painful time, and I am not dead. Thanks be to his name for his tender care over a poor wretch like me ! We landed at Sierra Leone in about a month after we sailed from Igayi. It was great joy among the slaves that day ; for we had supposed we should never see land any more. After we landed at Freetown, they sent us boys to York, in order that we might be instructed. There we were placed at school. We began at once to learn to read Eng lish books ; which books I have cause to praise God for, while I have life and breath ; for through the reading of those books, I came to know that high and glorious name of Jesus Christ the Saviour. But I have to acknowledge, that, although I read these books which taught me to know Jesus Christ the Saviour, I did not then believe in him as I ought to have believed. In five or six yeare after I came to this country, I began"], [386, "358 ASHANTEE AND THE GOLD COAST. to learn to pray morning and even ; although I did it not from the heart, for I did not know the nature of prayer at the time. In the year 1834, I began to attend the Methodist chapel. I praise God, and I will have to praise him if I be faithful to the end, that I have joined the Methodists' society ; for they are not careless about my soul ; they do not only tell me that heaven is a happy place, but they do teach me the way to it. May God bless this body, and may the work of God prosper in this land ! When I joined with them, I begin to seek the Lord ; and from the time I obtained the peace of God, I go among my friends, telling them that the Lord is good ; inviting them to come and taste for themselves how good the Lord is. The Lord has blessed my endeavours ; and many of them do come, having found what I said to be true, and they are enabled to tell others of the Saviour they have found I find the work of God to be good work, and it hath been the delight of my soul. I pray God to assist me in doing this work, as saith the wise man, in the book of Ecclesiastes, \" Whatsoever thy hand find eth to do, do it with thy might ; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou goest.\""], [387, "359 APPENDIX.
