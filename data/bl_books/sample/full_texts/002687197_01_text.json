The first white person who was buried within the limits of the city of Syracuse, and probably within the bounds of On ondaga, was undoubtedly Benjamin Nukerk, who came into the country as an Indian trader, with Ephraim Webster, in 1 .56, before any settlements were made on the Military Res ervation, and who died here on the 7th day of December, 1787. He was buried on a pleasant little eminence, which over looks the Onondaga Lake and its shores, now embraced in Farm Lot No. 298 or 310, and lying directly in the rear of the residence of William Judson, on West Genesee Street, aud one or two hundred feet east of Geddes Street. The head and foot stones are both still standing aud in excellent preservation, and the inscription is quite legible. It is as fol lows : \u2014 BENJAMIN NUKERK, Died Dec. 7th, 1787, Aged 37 years. He is undoubtedly the same person who is called Selkirk in Mr. Clark's History of Onondaga, (Vol. 1st, p. 338). Mr. Clark is also in an error in supposing he succeeded Mr. Web ster in 1793, (Vol. 2d, p. S3). The grave is probably on Farm Lot No. 310, which is in the town of Geddes. About the year 1845, Joseph Savage, Esq., who owns the ground occupied by this grave \u2014 had occasion to dig a trench two or three feet below the surface, and while doing so struck"], [14, "6 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. upon a line of graves. On examination they proved to be placed in a direct line for some twenty or thirty feet, and consisted of quite a number of bodies. The bones were most ly decomposed, except the skulls, and among them were found quite a number of bullets. Probably the ground was never used as a permanent burial place, but these bodies fell in some battle, of which perhaps we have no record, and were hastily buried here in the sandy loam of this beautiful little eminence. But it may be otherwise, as he at other times found other remains in different places on the same little hillock \u2014 one\u2014 the skull of which had evidently been cleft by a tomahawk. A gun, brass kettle, flints and pipes were also found from time to time. The bodies were found mostly near the southeast corner of the knoll, about two hundred feet east of the large pine tree now standing. Origi nally there was quite a bluff at this point, which has been levelled down by carrying away loam and sand. The first burials in the village of Salina were made on ground now known as Lot No. 8 in Block No. 15, near the intersection of Spring and Free Streets. They however ceas ed to bury there before 1794, .aid began to make interments on the ground now embraced in Washington Park, and near to the spot where the Presbyterian Church, (recently remov ed ) was afterwards built. Mrs. Nancy T. Gilchrist, the mo ther of the present Ira A. Gilchrist, and several members of the families of Dexter and Herring, were buried here. \u2014 Mrs. Gilchrist in 1794. Burials were made here also but fir a few years, when find ing the location too near the dwellings, they began to bury upon the ridge which runs through Block No. 40, in the rear of the residence of James Lynch, Esq., and in the immedi-"], [15, "7 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. ate vicinity of that formerly occupied by the late Alfred Northam, Esq. This, too, was abandoned in 1801, when Sheldon Logan, at that time Superintendent of the Onondaga Salt Springs, laid out a piece of ground, then owned by the State for a public burial ground. It was used as such until the year 1829, and a few of the bodies buried on Washington Park, including that of Mrs. Gilchrist, and perhaps some from Block No. 40, were removed to the new grounds. Block No. 59, in the First Ward, covers the site of the grounds laid out by Mr. Logan. In the year 1829, the Legislature passed an Act, (Chap. 243,) vesting said Block No. 59 tn the Trustees of the village of Salina, authorizing the sale of Block No. 43 to said Trus tees for the purpose of a public cemetery, and directing said Trustees to prepare said Block No. 43 for the purposes in tended, to remove all the bodies from Block 59, and to sell the same at public auction. All the expenses of the pur chase, the preparation and improvement of the ground, and the removal of the bodies, were to be paid from the proceeds of the sale of Block No. 59. This law was immediately carried out in all its parts. \u2014 Block 59 was sold, after the removal of the bodies, and Block No. 43 has been used as a cemetery from that time till the present; and now nearly or quite all the lots have been ta ken up and occupied. Perhaps it may not be amiss to state in this connection that Isaac Van Vleck, Esq , the father of the late Matthew Van Vleck, formerly Inspector of the Salt Springs, and of the present Abraham Van Vleck, the first male child born within the limits of the city, and also of Mrs. George O'Blen-"], [16, "8 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. nis, was buried on Lot No. 8, Block No. 13, on what was then and is still known as the Schouten Lot. In the year 1834, previous to the Act of the Legislature (Chapter 160 of the Laws of 1835) incorporating Lodi with the village of Syracuse, the inhabitants of that locality established a small cemetery on Beach Street, on the top of the hill south of East Genesee Street, on Farm Lot No. 197. The late Oliver Teall, Esq., who then held a contract for the lot, furnished the land and offered an acre of ground or more if desired, on con dition that the people in that vicinity would clear and fence. They hired a Mr. Bates to do the clearing and fencing. But about half an acre has ever been enclosed and that is now most ly occupied. Few interments have been made there of late years. Some bodies have been removed, and the place has been much neglected, and, if not already, will soon be abandoned. The first burials within the limits of the late village of Syracuse, were made on land now enclosed in Block No. 105, near the intersection of Clinton and Fayette streets. They probably did not exceed twenty or thirty in number, and the citizens ceased to bury there previous to the year 1819. When Messrs. Owen. Forman, and John Wilkinson laid out the village of Milan, in 1819, and made a map of the same, no spot of ground seems to have been set apart for a cemetery, but the recent loss of that map precludes entire certainty on that point. At least, from that time till the year 1824, all burials were made at Salina, Onondaga Hiil, or Onondaga Hollow. The first person buried in what is now designated as the \"Old Cemetery\" (being the east end of Block No. 98), was Mrs. Eliza Spencer, the first wife of the present Thomas Spencer, Esq., who died on the 2nd day of April, 1824. After the village passed into the hands of"], [17, "9 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. the late Syracuse Company, they probably set apart this piece of ground for a cemetery; and it continued to be used as such until the year 1841. At a meeting of the Trustees of the village, held on the 10th day of May, 1841, Hiram Putnam, Esq., being Presi dent, a resolution was adopted, to call a public meeting, to be held on the 18th day of May, then instant, \" To take \" into consideration the propriety of raising money for a \" public cemetery for said village.\" On the 11th day of May, the President and Clerk of the village published a call for \"a meeting of the taxable inhab \" itants of the village of Syracuse.\" The meeting was held on the lStli ; adjourned from tho Mansion House to the fourth story of the Neio Banking House \u2014 over the Onondaga County Bank and Bank of Syr acuse. Elihu L. Phillips, Esq., offered a resolution for the purchase of parts of Farm Lots Nos. 128 and 242 \u2014 the same premises recently embraced in Rose Hill Cemetery \u2014 con taining 22T{Hb acres. It was very well understood, in advance, that it was in tended to purchase this property, and there was a very strong opposition to it. The soil was considered unfavorable and the location undesirable. The purchase was strongly urged by Philo N. Rust, Andrew N. Van Patten, John H. Johnson, Amos P. Granger, and others. It was resisted equally stren uously by Aaron Burt, Lyman Clary, Henry Gifford, Wm. B. Kirk, Thos. Rose, John Wilkinson, and others. The resolution was discussed at great length \u2014 various amendments were offered and rejected, and the original resolu tion finally passed. On the 27th of the same month, in compliance with a peti-"], [18, "10 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. tion signed by many citizens, the Trustees ordered another meeting of the taxable inhabitants, at the same place, on the 4th day of June, then next, \" to consider the business in \" regard to a new cemetery.\" At the meeting of June 4th Thos. Rose, Esq., offered a resolution to rescind all the proceedings of May 18th in regard to the new cemetery. The subject had excited a deep interest in the village, and had called together the great body of the leading citizens. The resolution to rescind was de bated at great length, and finally rejected by a vote of 79 to 57. The names of those voting and the way they voted will be found in Appendix \" F.\" On motion of Gen. Granger, two hundred dollars were voted at the same meeting for the improvement ofthe grounds. This property was conveyed to the Trustees of the village by George F. Leitch and Catharine K. his wife, under date of July 1st, 1841, (Book No. 78 of Deeds, page 452), and the Trustees proceeded at once to the improvement of the grounds. Ambrose S. Townsend, who died on the 24th day of August, 1841, was the first person buried at Rose Hill. He was the oldest son of John Townsend, Esq., of Albany, and grandson of the late Ambrose Spencer. This ground has been occupied till the present time, but has never been satisfactory to a large portion of our citizens. It has always been evident that, owing to the proximity of the ground to the city, it ought never to have been used for the purpose <*f a cemetery. The subsoil, which is a firm, tenacious clay, and full of water in the Spring and Fall, constituted' another very serious, and, to many, insuperable objection. And, in addition to this, the surface of the ground was"], [19, "11 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. unfavorable, more than one-half of it being a steep side hill, and not easily accessible, and the whole of it was devoid ot Trees and Shrubs, and incapable of being ever made beauti ful or attractive. Our citizens had never manifested any great interest in the grounds. They were never a source either of pride or pleasure. Little effort was ever made to adorn or improve them. They were by many deemed incapable of those high adornments which the public taste now demands. No doubt the city officials have often, if not generally, sympathized in those views and feelings. \u00b0 t For these, and perhaps other reasons, an early desire was manifested by many of our citizens to procure grounds for a cemetery more in conformity to the higher cultivation of modern taste on this subject. \u00a7 As early as the years 1852-3 a number of meetings were held by a few prominent citizens, and the subject of a new Cemetery fully discussed and considered. Committees were appointed for the purpose of thoroughly examining the vicin ity of the city, in all directions, and finding the locality best adapted in all respects for the purposes of a rural cemetery. Those committees carefully performed their dut}*, and after a most critical examination of the vicinity of the town for the distance of several miles in all directions, they came unanimously to the conclusion that the hundred acres of land best fitted for all the purposes desired, was that now embraced within the limits of Oakwood. But our hopes were not then destined to be realized. No one seemed willing to put himself at the head of the enter prise, and assume all the labor and responsibility which that position necessarily imposes. Winter came on soon after"], [20, "12 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. the final conclusion was ai rived at, in regard to the grounds , and before the following Spring it was for the time forgotten in the pursuit of other objects of more pressing personal interest. The persons who most particularly interested themselves in the effort of 1852-3, were Messrs. Henry A. Dillaye, Charles B. Sedgwick, John B. Burnet, Robert B. Raymond, Charles Pope, Hamilton White, A. C. Powell, C. Tyler Longstreet, Israel Hall, John Wilkinson, Allen Munroe, and E. W. Leavenworth. The subject was again revived in the Summer of 1857, by Messrs. Hamilton White, James L. Bagg, Lewis H. Red field, C. Tyler Longstreet, A. C. Powell, John Wilkinson and Henry A. Dillaye. The papers were drawn up prepar atory to the organization of an Association \u2014 the terms of the purchase of the grounds above referred to were verbally agreed upon, when the whole subject was suddenly put to rest by the great pecuniary revulsion of that year. A final and eventually successful effort was again made in the Summer of 1858, principally by Messrs. White and Leavenworth. This was continued with little interruption till the Summer of 1859. Having arranged with Chas. A. Baker, Esq., for the pur chase of the front twenty acres, and with Henry Raynor, Esq., for the balance of the ground, the first object to which attention was directed, was the removal of the Jamesville Plank Road from the bounds of the proposed cemetery. It became necessary to procure the consent of a majority of the stockholders, and then of a majority of the directors \u2014 afterwards of a majority of the inhabitants residing on the East and West Road, crossing the said Plank Road near its"], [21, "13 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. first gate, to which the road was to be changed \u2014 next of the Supervisor and Commissioners of Highways of the Town of Onondaga, in which Town the road is situated \u2014 and finally, to procure a right of way for said Plank Road across the lands of Chas. A. Baker, Esq., and Dr. David S. Colvin. After a year of laborious effort, and with the benefit of much aid from Mr. Baker, these several objects were succes sively attained, and all serious obstacles to the final accom plishment of our object seemed to be removed, except the raising of the necessary funds for the purchase. To that important service A. C. Powell, Esq., for weeks, devoted a large portion of his time, and with such aid as he had from Messrs. Hawley, White and Leavenworth, succeeded early in August in raising the necessary amount in subscriptions, payable equally in one, two and three years, with interest. [See copy of Subscription, Appendix E.] On the 15th day of August, 1859, the subscribers to the fund, in pursuance of a circular addressed to them severally, met at the Mayor's office and organized the Association of Oakwood, and elected the following Trustees : Allen Munroe, Hamilton White, J. P. Haskins, Timothy R. Porter, Robert G. Wynkoop, J. Dean Hawley, Thomas G. Alvord, E. W. Leavenworth. John Crouse, John Wilkinson, Archibald C. Powell, Austin Myers, [See Articles of Association in Appendix, letter D.] On the day following a meeting of the Trustees was held at the office of E. W. Leavenworth, and the following offi cers were chosen :"], [22, "14 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. E. W. Leavenworth, President. A. C. Powell, Vice Hamilton White, Treasurer. Allen Munroe, Secretary. At the same meeting, a resolution was adopted on motion of Mr. Alvord, instructing the officers of the Association to purchase of Messrs. Baker & Raynor the lands now embraced in Oakwood on the terms theretofore agreed upon, viz. : 89,500 for the twenty acres in front bought of Mr. Baker, aud $15,000 for the 72TW acres, bought of Mr. Raynor, in the rear. Agreeably to such resolution, the purchase was made and papers exchanged on the fifth day of September thereafter. All the lots in Rose Hill Cemetery, and also in that at Salina, having been sold, and the Common Council having resolved t:> sell the north eight acres of the former, the Trus tees made immediate preparations for the improvement of the grounds, and early in October, Howard Daniels, Esq., an accomplished landscape gardener from the city of New York, with the aid of fifty or sixty men, commenced the work, and continued it till the month of December. The first person buried at Oakwood was Mrs. Nellie G. Williamson, who died on the 6th, and was buried on Tuesday, the 8th day of November, 1859. The first monument of any kind erected within the bounds ofthe cemetery, was that of James Crouse, Esq., on Section No. 13, put up during the winter of 1859-60. On the 14th day of November the first public sale of Lots took place, and from that d\u00a3.y to the first day of February following, more than seven thousand dollars' worth of Lots"], [23, "15 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. were selected, and but a small part, even of the subscribers, had then made their selections. Thus, at length, after nearly ten years of delays and diffi culties and disappointments, after the project had been more than once abandoned, and our hopes all but extinguished, this lovely spot of ground was secured for the final repose of our dead : to be visited, admired, and hallowed in our mem ories, while we live, by a thousand sacred and tender recol lections, and to be the beautiful resting place of our bodies when summoned to our final homes."], [24, "DEDICATION. On Thursday, the 3rd day of November, the grounds were dedicated, with appropriate ceremonies, to the sacred pur poses of a resting place for the dead. The Hon. Wm. J. Bacon, of Utica, kindly consented to deliver the Address, Alfred B. Street, the Poem, and the Rev. John Pierpont, of Boston, and Mrs. Thos. T. Davis, to furnish each an Ode. The occasion was one of deep interest to the citizens of Syracuse, and many thousands testified their appreciation of the importance of the object attained, by their presence on the ground. The day, which was lowery and threatening in the morning, became bright and beautiful, and one of the pleasantest of the season. The following was the Order of Exercises published on the occasion : DEDICATION OF OAKWOOD CEMETERY. The Trustees of \"Oakwood\" have the pleasure of announcing to the citizens of Syracuse, that Thursday, November 3rd, 1859, has been desig nated as the day for the opening of Oakwood Cemetery. The Military, Fire Department, and Civic Associations, have been invited to participate in the ceremonies of the ocaasion. The procession will be formed at 10\u00a3 o'clock a. m., under the direction of Gen. Robt. M. Richardson, assisted by the 24th Brigade Staff, in the following order: Gen. R. M. Richardson, Chief Marshal; miller's regimental band ; 51st Regiment N. Y. S. M., under command of Col. Walrath;"], [25, "OAKWOOD CEMETERY. 17 samsel's band; Fire Department, under direction of B. L.

George Morgan Hills. After the services at Oakwood Cemetery, the procession will again form under the direction of the Chief Marshal, and march to Ciinton Square, where it will be dismissed. The procession was formed about 11 A. M.. on Salina street, in front of the Syracuse House, under the direction of (ien'l Rob't M. Richardson, and immediately took up the line of march for Oakwood. A spacious platform had been erected for the occasion, for the accommodation of the Ora tors, Poet, Clergy, Trustees, and other gentlemen, in Dedi cation Valley, directly north of the west end of Section No. 13, and seats for the audience on the side of the hill directly north of the platform. 2"], [26, "18 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. The exercises were opened by Miller's Regimental Band. with the \"Dead March\" in Saul. At the conclusion, the Rev. M. E. Strieby offered the following PRAYER: Almighty God, thou author of our existence, and in who;e hands is the breath of our lives, we come together this morning to dedicate and to consecrate these grounds to a sacred purpose. The natures which thou hast implanted within us prompt us to a kind care, and suitable burial of the bodies of our departed friends, and Thy Holy Word sanctifies and sanctions these desires ; for thou didst approve the anointing which Mary gave for Thy burial, and the embalming and interment which sorrowing friends gave to Thy body. So in this consecrated spot, we can bring our -friendsi, from time to time, to lay them here, and at length we shall all be borne to the earth in this holy sepulchre, or some other resting place of the dead. Grant that in the dedication we make of this consecrated ground, we may be accepted ; and finally, when the trumpet of the Archangel shall sound, and this ground shall give up its dead, aud all the earth shall open up her receptacles, do thou then grant, Heavenly Father, to take us to that resting place where there shall be no more sorrow, no more tears, and no more death ; and to the Eternal God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, shall be the praise and the glory forever more. Amen. The Rev. Mr. Fillmore was here introduced and read the following beautiful Hymn, written for the occasion by Mrs. Thomas T. Davis, of this city."], [27, "19 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. HYMN. BY MRS. TnOMAS T. DAVIS. Air \u2014 PleyeVs Hymn. Life and Love with tender hand Guard and deck this Silent Land ; Cypress arch and willow wreath Shade the sacred sod beneath ; Sun and starlight gild the shrine, Flow'ry chaplets fondly twine ; Angel hosts, your vigils keep Where our loved and lost shall sleep. Loved, not lost ! No fear nor gloom Shrouds the portal of the tomb ; Death revealed immortal day When the Rock was rolled away. Grave and crypt and pallid stone Mark not the realm of Death alone ; Life but sleeps, while Death survives, \u2014 Death shall die, and Life arise. Shed not then the frenzied tear ; Robe in light the pall, the bier ; Yonder see the shining shore Where our loved have gone before; Rear the marble o'er the dead, Crown with flowers the dreamless head ; Calmly wait till Life shall be Blended with eternity. This Hymn was then sung by the members of the Syra cuse Musical Institute, under the leadership of H. N. White, Esq. The Hon. E. W. Leavenworth, President of the Cemetery Association, then came forward and delivered the introduc tory address, as follows: Ladies and Fellow Citizens: \u2014 We arc assembled here this day upon an occasion of absorbing interest. Our long cherished hopes, so often"], [28, "20 QAKWOOD CEMETERY. overclouded, so often deferred, are this day realized. Our highest anticipations are more than fulfilled. We are convened here this morning that with appropriate ceremonies, and with becoming solemnity, we may set apart the loveliest spot upon the Banks of the Onondaga, as the final resting-place of our beloved and honored dead. We have come together to consecrate for ourselves, a dwelling for these mortal bodies, when the labors and cares, and trials of life are over, and the spirit has ascended to God who gave it. How long, with anxious eyes, has this day been looked for ! Through how many years of hope and doubt, and fear \u2014 of efforts and disappointments, have we struggled on, that at length we might enter upon this promised land ! But hope is now fruition, and this occasion is the joyful evi dence of our full success. An ample, permanent and attractive resting place for our dead, seems to be the last great necessity of our city. Water and gas\u2014 railroads and canals \u2014 a salubrious climate \u2014 a fer tile soil \u2014 prosperous agriculture, commerce and manufac tures, have supplied the great wants of our town \u2014 filled our laps with plenty and made our homes the abodes of happi ness and peace. But while laboring so diligently and suc cessfully for the wants of the living, we had forgotten what was due to the dying and the dead. No adequate, suitable or permanent provision had been made for their repose. All our present cemeteries are inadequate in their dimen sions, entirely unsuitable in their location and the character of their soils, and it is perhaps not too much to say, that when the friends of those who now rest in them have passed away, they must yield to the onward and irresistible pro-"], [29, "21 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. gress of population and improvement. The fate of those similarly situated in other cities, and even in our own, warn us of the inevitable result. But fortunately, our long delay has not, in this instance, proved our ruin. Fortunately, almost providentially, we have been able to secure the spot of ground which nature seems to have intended for the purpose to which we now dedicate it. Although but a mile and a half from the cen tre of our city, looking down from each successive elevation upon the town, the lake and the lovely valley of the Onon daga, happily the hand of improvement, till now, had never reached it. A variety of circumstances had preserved it in all the loveliness of nature, for the final home of many gen erations yet unborn. Within its one hundred acres is embraced a combination of attractions which, if anywhere equalled, are no where surpassed. Placed most fortunately, not too near the city, nor too remote from it, mostly covered with young and thrifty woods of the second growth, so abundant as to allow great opportunity for selection \u2014 its surface diversified by the most beautiful and varied elevations and depressions. presenting views unrivalled in their extent and their mag nificence \u2014 rendered already attractive by natural lawns, and the most picturesque scenery, it is all that the highest judg ment and taste can demand, or the liveliest fancy paint. \u2014 And the careful hand of improvement will, each successive year, develop and heighten the charms with which nature has so liberally adorned it. Each loved form, committed by pious hands to its sacred dust, will invest its quiet vales and hill-sides with a yearly increasing interest, until each one of us shall have some"], [30, "22 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. tender tie to lead us often hither, and until we ourselves, now in the vigor of health, shall be permitted, beneath these lovely shades, to return to our kindred dust. From this day these grounds will be annually improved by graded and graveled walks and avenues \u2014 by smiling lawns and quiet winding paths beneath the shadows of the toweling oaks \u2014 enriched and adorned by sculptured mar bles, and the various testimonials which wealth and affection will yearly consecrate to virtue and loveliness \u2014 hallowed more and more as years speed on in their tireless course, by the holiest feelings of the soul, by memories and emotions which find a home in every human heart. Soon The mortal remains of thousands among us, who are now walking our streets, arrayed in the beauty of health, shall slumber be neath her holy, quiet breast. Increasing thousands will an nually seek the silence of this holy ground. Hither the busy, struggling world will often come to enjoy, for a time, the balmy breath of Heaven \u2014 to commune with nature in her loveliest forms, and in these secluded retreats to forg-et for an hour the toils and cares of life. Hither the stran\"-er o will direct his course, to mark the evidence and the standard of our civilization. Hither age, with tottering steps, will sometimes come to view the spot where he must shortly lie. Here, too, at evening's silent hour \u2014 wrapped in sable weeds \u2014quiet and alone, the widow, the mother \u2014 the desolate and bereaved of every name\u2014 will wend their way with slow and solemn tread and saddened hearts, to drop another tear over the graves of those they loved. From whatever point of view we regard this enterprise, we are compelled to contemplate it as one of surpassing in terest and importance to the citizens of Syracuse, and well"], [31, "OAKWOOD CEMETERY. 23 may we who are here assembled this day, congratulate our selves, if in any humble degree, even, we have contributed to the accomplishment of an object so desirable to the living, so respectful to the dead. The first serious efforts for the establishment of a Rural Cemetery in this city, were made in the years 1852-3. Sev eral meetings were held and were well attended. Commit tees were appointed to view the adjacent country and find suitable grounds. After a very thorough examination, those \u2022committees reported, and it was generally, if not unani mously conceded, that the grounds we now occupy were the most desirable in the vicinity of the city. But after reach ing this point, the enterprise was permitted to sleep \u2014 mainly, I think, for the reason that no one seemed willing to put himself at the head of the effort necessary to accomplish the result. It was again revived in 1857 with renewed zeal. The price of the land was agreed upon, all the necessary papers were drawn, preparatory to a final organization, when the great financial revulsion of that year arrested the enterprise. Fifteen months since, in the summer of 155S, a few of the gentlemen who had heretofore interested themselves in this matter again met, and resolved to renew the effort. Num berless difficulties seemed to surround them. Several months were consumed before we obtained a sat isfactory offer for the sale of the lands. The Plank Road, passing through the grounds, was con sidered, and very properly, an insuperable objection, and one which must be removed before the purchase was con summated. Much delay and some difficulty was experi enced in procuring the consent of tho stockholders and di-"], [32, "24 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. rectors of said road \u2014 in obtaining the sanction of such removal from the Town Officers of the Town of Onondaga \u2014 in procuring the new right of way which said removal made necessary, and more than all, in raising the $25,000 which was required to make the purchase. But patience and perseverance met with their accustomed reward. The enterprise was regarded with favor and liberally treated by the bulk of our citizens, and I am happy here, in this public manner, to acknowledge our obligations to the stockholders and directors of the Jamesville Plank Road Company, and to the Supervisor and Commissioners of the Town of Onon daga, as well as to many other gentlemen, who fully appre ciated the value of the object which we had in view, and contributed to its accomplishment. Fifteen months have seen every obstacle removed ; the association organized, the lands purchased, and the work of improvement moving rapidly forward, under the guidance and direction of Mr. Howard Daniels, of the city of New York, an accomplished landscape gardener, whose large ex perience and cultivated taste will develope all its beauties, and render Oakwood the pride and the pleasure of every citizen of Syracuse. At the conclusion of Mayor Leavenworth's address, Alfred B. Street, Esq., of Albany, pronounced the following exqui sitely beautiful and appropriate POEM: O'er life's fresh springtide, when the blithesome hours Dance to glad music through perennial flowers \u2022 O'er bounding youth, when hope points ever on, No blossom scentless, and no. color wan ;"], [33, "25 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. O'er stately manhood, when the mounting tread Seeks the far prize that stars the crag o'erhead ; O'er trembling age, when, worn with toil and woe, It turns from light above to gloom below ; Darkens a shade, mysterious, cold and black, Mantling the flowery as the wintry track ; Brooding where joy its diamond goblet quaffs ; Where daring, loud at every danger laughs ; Where strength securely rests on future years ; Where fame, wealth, pleasure, each its votary cheers ; Death is that shade, inexorable Death, With ever lifted dart at all of mortal breath. But though the soul that lights the frame depart, The darkened dust is sacred to the heart. Around the spot that wraps the dead from sight, Lingers thought's tenderest, love's divinest light ; Hallowed by suffering, it remains a shrine Where oft sad memory wends, its fairest flowers to twine. The land that trod through Deluge-ooze its way, Gave to the pyramid its mummied clay. The purple skies of Art and Song inurned The sacred ashes sacred fires had burned. The Parsee offered to his God, the sun, On the grand crag the heart whose course was run. And the red roamer of the prairie sea Yields to the air his wrecked mortality. But not to pyramid, though mocking Time, The urn funereal, nor the sun sublime, Nor boundless air, nor yet the waste of waves, That stateliest, mightiest, most august of graves \u2014 But yet in such drear weltering vastness spread Should Christian hands consign the Christian dead. But to the earth, the warm, the steadfast earth, That, touched by God's own finger, gave us birth ; Where to the resurrecting sun and rain The seed but perishes to live again ; Where Nature hides her life in Winter's gloom For warbling Spring to sing it into bloom ; Home of the tree that sheds its leafy showers For the new garland wreathed by vernal hours !"], [34, "26 OAKWOOD CEMETERY.

Within the glen, as murmurings fill the tree, A voice shall seem to whisper, \" Come with me !\" And the green hill top \u2014 whence the sight is fraught, With the rich painting Nature's hand hath wrought ; Woodland and slope, mount, meadow and ravine, The city's white, the water's purple sheen, Aud the dim mountain tops, until the gaze Pierces where distance hangs its tender haze \u2014 Tell that the soul, with onward pointed eye, Finds its far limit only in the sky. The grassy dingle and the leafy dell Shall tremble sadly to the tolling bell ; Where now wide solitude wraps slope and glade For winds to pipe to dancing sun and shade, Shall carved memorials of the dead be found Breathing their solemn eloquence around. Here, shall the son, in some prone trunk, descry The sire he saw in life's completeness die ; Here, shall the sire, in some green pine, survey The stately son, ere death had claimed its prey ; Here, in the flower, the mother again shall see The laughing child that perished at her knee; Here, the weird wind shall with long, melting moan, Mingle its sadness with the mourner's own, And the drear cloud, low brooding, seem a part Of the dark sorrow hanging on his heart ; Here, too, the joyful splendor of the sun Shall tell the life, the loved and lost hath wod, And warblings sweet, the landscape's ear that sill Of those glad strains the sounding heavens that thrill, Summer shall here hold green and leafy time, Emblem of those that perished in their prime ; Autumn shall shower its wreaths upon the air,"], [35, "OAKWOOD CEMETERY\". 27 Sign to the living also to prepare ; Winter shall spread in fierce and frowning might, Great type of death, its chilling robes of white ; But oh, glad thought ! in Spring's triumphant reign Nature shall bound in radiant joy again, Bid with her rapturous life Death's horrors flee, Type of that glorious truth \u2014 Man's Immortality. Music by Sutherland's Band. The Hon. Wm. J. Bacon, of Utica, was now introduced, and delivered the ORATION We have assembled this day, my friends, to perform a grateful and pious duty. It is to consecrate, by fitting cere monies, and appropriate memorials, a new place of burial for the dead, another abode where the wearied spirit and the exanimate body may lie down and rest. To the living it should be a grateful duty, for thereby our hearts become chastened and purified, and our eager chase after the things that perish modified, if not arrested. It is pious toward the dead, in the preparation we make for their secure and pleas ant repose, when the storms of life have ceased to beat, and by 'garnishing their sepulchres,\" we bring back to our re membrance the forms and characters of those loved aud de parted ones whom we expect to deposit here. Care of, and respect for the dead, would seem to be a nat ural and spontaneous instinct of the human heart, but its manifestations are by no means uniform. In its higher de velopments it is the out-growth of civilization and refine ment, aided or repressed by the view a community is accus tomed to take of the sanctity of life, the solemnity of death, and the things that follow after that last mortal change."], [36, "28 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. Perhaps the earliest record we have of a transaction by which the ashes of the dead were secure of a resting place. and the title thereto assured in perpetuity to the purchaser and his descendants, is derived from the narrative of the sacred historian in Genesis. It was while Abraham yet dwelt as a stranger and sojourner in the land which was subse quently confirmed to his posterity as the promised inheritance, that he lost the wife of his youth, the honored mother of that son in whom his seed was to be called. They had dwelt long and lovingly together. In all his wanderings \u2014 when, obeying the Divine command, he departed from his country, and his kindred, and his father's house, \u2014 she had been his faithful and constant companion, and now, at the age of one hundred and twenty-seven years, she had reached her ultimate earthly pilgrimage; and at Hebron, in the land of Canaan, she laid down to die, and Abraham came to \" mourn for Sarah, and \" to weep for her.\" And then occurred the transaction recorded in the 23rd Chapter of Genesis, by which, for the sum of \"four hundred shekels of silver, current money with \" the merchant,\" the desired burial place was forever secured, even \"the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, and \" the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in \" the field, and that were in all the borders round about.\" How fondly in after years the memory of Abraham recurred to this sacred spot, we hardly needed any narrative to inform us ; but that it was so remembered by him and his family, for at least three generations, we are abundantly assured by the fact that there his own remains were deposited, there Jacob changed his sons to bury him, for there, he adds with pious recognition of his honored ancestry and love for his kindred, \" there they buried Abraham, and Sarah his wife ;"], [37, "29 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. \"there Isaac was buried, and Rebekah his wife, and there I \" buried Leah ;\" and when Joseph died he took an oath of the children of Israel that they should carry up his bones from the land of Egypt, beyond all doubt that he, likewise, might be gathered to his fathers, and rest in the same hallowed and secure inclosure. It seems a little difficult to assign an aderp.ate reason for the exceeding care and costliness displayed by the ancient Egyptians in the disposition they made of the remains of the dead. That something inspired this, beyond mere respect for the memory of departed friends and kindred, would appear to be indicated by the existence of those vast catacombs, the mighty cities of the dead, preserved by the process of embalming, for an apparently interminable duration, and the erection of pyramids, for the existence of which no reason so satisfactory has been given as that which assigns to them the office of sepulchres of their lulers, so aptly described by Job when he speaks of \" Kings and Counsellors of the earth \" which built desolate places for themselves.\" Desolate and dreary, indeed, are those towering aud shapeless masses, standing, as they do, amid arid wastes of ever-shifting sand, the very names of the builders unknown, and their ashes undistinguished from the common dust that, in mummied preservation, still mocks at death and wears the semblance of a hideous life. Who, in contrast with these, as he con templates his last resting place, would not, with fervent aspi rations, breathe the wish of the Christian poet, \" Mine be the breezy hill that skirts the down, Where a green grassy turf is all I crave, With here and there a violet bestrown, Fast by a brook or fountain's murmuring wave, And may an evening sun shine sweetly on my grave."], [38, "30 OAKWOOD CEMETERY*. Among the Hebrews there existed a strong feeling of respect for the remains of the dead, and their places of burial were selected with great care and preserved with solicitous regard. They excavated caves in their ornamented gardens, hewed out rocky sepulchres in the sides of mountain decliv ities, and sought equally the sequestered valley, the open hill*\u00bbp, and the leafy forest. In contradistinction from most, if not all, of the anc*ent nations, they called the grave the \" House of the Living,\" indicating thereby their belief that it was not the \"be-all and the end-all\" here or hereafter, but was only the portal of that vista that opened up into another and a larger and a nobler bfe, \u2014 and thus, when Our Savior declared that \" God is not the God of the dead, but of tho \u2022'living,\" he uttered a truism, which, by the Jewish mind \u2014 acquainted with their own history, the traditional usages and language of the common people, not to speak of the teachings of their prophets and wise men\u2014 should have been instantly recognized, and as familiar to their thoughts as household words. With the Greeks and Romans, and especially with the former, the feeling that prompted costly memorials and votive offerings to the dead, was more \u00e6sthetic than religious : for, as they recognized no assured hope of life beyond the tomb, they had no especial lessoDs to draw from the grave, save those which might animate the living to emulate the deeds which in this life had made the departed illustrious. To the momentous question propounded more than three thousand years ago, \"Isa man die, shall he live again?\" the most cul tivated and learned Heathenism had no answer save the dim foreshadowings on the bright ethereal mind of Plato, and the speculations which in a later age employed the leisure"], [39, "31 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. and engaged the imperial mind of Tully. But how meagre and unsatisfactory were their highest views and noblest aspi rations, is indicated by the fact that, in that dimly descried future, that land afar off, that \" diem pr\u0153olaretri\" which the great Roman orator hoped might in some unknown region break upon his eyesight, his highest visions of happiness were connected not with the presence of Him who is tin fountain of all that is pure, and holy, and good, but with dwelling in classic abodes, mingling in the councils of the wise and the learned, and communing with men illustrious in arts and arms, celebrated in song and renowned in storv. To the common people the future life, if any there was, presented no recognized system of reward or of retribution. Only the illustrious, by a divine apotheosis, were raised to the gods, whom it required no great stretch of virtue to equal or excel ; while the punishments of the impious, the incestuous, and the cruel, could only be made palpable to the sense by such material torments, as the water soliciting the taste, and forever eluding the grasp of Tantalus, the iron wheel of Ixion, and the ever rolling and ceaselessly rebound ing stone of Sisyphus. But what mythology by its fanciful and empty creations, and fphilosophy in its highest reach of thought and most earnest yearnings of spirit, could never attain, \u2014 a ray of light from the throne of the invisible has now revealed to us. When Jesus of Nazareth through mortal lips proclaimed to the weeping sisters of Bethany, \" I am the resurrection and the life,\" the darkness of the tomb fled away, and henceforth and evermore it was that \"Life, and warmth, and joyous light, And sorrow's softened tone, Were round the pleasant path which seemed To lead to heaven alone.\""], [40, "32 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. How imiw'ediately and beautifully was the power of this new revelation manifested in the life and death, the cheerful burial places, and the monumental emblems and inscriptions of the early Christians. They adopted the Greek word Koimeteria \u2014 cemeteries \u2014 literally, places of sleep \u2014 as the appropriate and characteristic designation of the spots they devoted to the repose of the dead. When, in the language of the Scriptures, their brethren \"fell asleep,\" devout men carried them to their burial, and, though lamentations and tears were not restrained, they laid them down in hope, con fident that the sleep of the good and the holy would be fol lowed by a sure and blissful waking. They carved no such emblems on their tombstones as inverted torches, to intimate that when the light of life went out it was never to be rekindled: but the star of faith, the anchor of hope, and the rainbow of promise, garnished and flamed out as well 'on humble stone as on towering shaft or commemorative cenotaph ; while such inscriptions as \" A father to his son \" borne away by angels,\" \" To him who now lives among the \" innocent ones,\" \" He is not dead, but sleepeth,\" marked, in the strongest contrast with heathen hopelessness, their abid ing trust in the life of joy and blessedness, \" Whose portal they called Death.\" It is in full accordance with these glorious hopes, and somewhat in imitation of the spirit that animated those early disciples of our common faith, that we come this day to ded icate this Cemetery, this sleeping-place, this house of repose, for some that have gone before and many that shall follow after us. I am not sufficiently familiar with your local his tory to bo acquainted with the varied steps of progress throno-h"], [41, "33 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. which you have passed, until you have reached the culmina ting point which has secured the quiet glades, the leafy nooks, and the lovely outlooking hilltops of \"Oakwood,\" as a \"pos \" sesgion of a burial-place\" to you and to your children for ever. I may, doubtless, assume that yours has been the usual history of all the early settlements in our country, from the day when the pilgrims at Plymouth hurried their dear departed ones to undistinguished graves. They buried them in silence and in fear, and raised not even a mound over their resting places, lest tho ever watchful foe should discover their diminished numbers, and know how few of those brave and manly hearts were left to shelter the weak and helpless that still looked up to them for succor. You passed through no such unhappy experience as this ; and yet it is quite possible, so marvellous has been your growth and development, that there are those yet living and moving among you, \u2014 perchance standing amid the witnesses of the cerempnies of this day, \u2014 who also witnessed here the first burial, heard the first wail of sadness that went up from stricken hearts, and listened to the first prayer that broke the solitude of the sorest primeval, where now stands this fair and prosperous eity, teeming with life and energy and hope. The day that marked that first visitation of the angel of death in this new settlement, whenever it occurred, and whether the visit came to smiling infancy in its opening dawn of beau ty, to woman in her confiding weakness and faithful love, or to man in his stalwart strength, was a sad and memorable day. No slowly tolling bell sent the news to distant households that a spirit was passing to the unseen world ; no gathered crowds, attracted by curiosity or by sympathy, thronged the streets ; no sable hearse or nodding plumes were there to 3"], [42, "34 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. attend the dead to his resting-place, but grief, though simple, was sincere, and mourning, though it had no outward show, was heartfelt and universal. Then was the virgin soil first pierced to receive that earliest tenant, where the great reaper, Death, subsequently gathered in his victims with such fre quency that the little spot of earth thus dedicated to his dominion became too limited to receive the increasing multi tude. Then did you, or your fathers, seek larger fields and wider boundaries, where humble affection planted flowers and ample wealth erected marble obelisks, until, in time, that teeming ground became too straight for its occupants, and taste and large-hearted beneficence, no less than imperative necessity, guided your footsteps to this pleasant spot. In the early days of New England, the place most com monly selected for a burial ground was an enclosure adjacent to, and, indeed, surrounding, their houses of worship, so that from the open window the living could look out upon the mansions ofthe dead, and read the names of tlje fathers and mothers of the hamlet, and ponder the lessons suggested by the holy texts that \" tanght the rustic moralist to die.\" These places were frequently indicated by a name which Long fellow very happily commemorates when he says I like that ancient Saxon phrase which calls The burial-place \"God's acre\" \u2014 it is just; It consecrates each grave within its walls, And breathes a benison o'er the sleeping dust.\" You may have had no such places of repose around or in the neighborhood of your churches ; yet have I seen in my walks about your city a spot where tottering and moss-grown stones and half-decayed enclosures are yet visible. The busy hand of enterprise has almost entirely surrounded it, and, ere"], [43, "35 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. 'ong. yielding to the inevitable march of improvement, the ashes of the few yet sleeping there must be mingled with and undistinguishable from the common earth, or blown with restless violence by the winds of heaven to far-distant regions. Each of them had a history in his day, and, as each one was laid in the narrow house, weary feet and aching hearts went back to desolate hearthstones, and sadly took up again the burden of life which the lost had aided them to bear. And now the busy throng of the living sweeps by them, and they heed it not. Rushing railroad trains, with thundering tread, jar and shake the solid earth above them, but their repose is not broken. Like the long separated, but in death united, lovers in \" Evangeline \" \u2014 \" In the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed ; Daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them ; Thousands of throbbing hearts, while theirs are at rest, and forever ; Thousands of aching brains, while theirs no longer are busy ; Thousands of toiling hands, while theirs have ceased from their labors ; Thousands of weary feet, while theirs have completed their journey.\" If there be, my friends, no kindred left to care for and protect their remains, and the hand of improvement must invade their rest, gather up, I beseech you, the poor dust, ere it be borne away beyond recovery, and make room for these relics in your new and beautiful grounds, that there they may, if possible, enjoy that repose that shall not be again broken until the voice of the archangel and the trump of God shall call the dead to judgment. A burial place in a crowded city is ever a heartless and repulsive object. Pressed upon by the habitations of the living, and only preserved from intrusive familiarity or unhal lowed desecration by high and forbidding walls, it presents no scenery to attract, no quietness and peace to allure to"], [44, "36 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. meditation. But rural cemeteries, at a pleasant and yet accessible remove from the dwellings of men, with waving trees and sweet-scented flowers, the emblems and symbols of the heart, with \"yellow sunshine and flowing air,\" vocal with song of birds and sighing winds and murmuring streams, these are fitted to soothe at the same time that they elevate the spirit, and, while they teach us no forgetfulness, make us less repining and disconsolate. The graves of all the dead have myriad voices, that speak to the living with more than the eloquence of human lips. They tell us of man's frailty \u2014 they arrest the swift current of thoughtless, worldly life \u2014 they bring us near the confines of the unseen and the better land, and teach us, if we will but listen, how to live with wisdom and to die with hope. But the burial place of those we love is always invested with far deeper interest. It is here that the heart has gar nered up its treasures, and will not let them die. And in future years, upon this now untrodden ground, will many bitter tears be shed, and many an unavailing sigh be breathed, and many trembling footsteps come and go, until the keen ness of a first great sorrow has been shaded down into a quiet grief, and we shall learn to love the place where they repose who have passed us by only a few stages in the great journey of life. Hither shall come the strong, stern man, whose heart has been so encased in the adamantine walls of world liness that only a wrench that tears his life-strings asunder can make him feel ; and here gentle and long-suffering woman, bending like the ozier beneath the great blow that bows her to the dust; and manly and ingenuous youth, struggling to hide a grief it cannot quite repress; and prattling childhood,"], [45, "37 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. all unconscious of its loss, shall come, and with loving and united labor they \" Here shall dress a sweeter sod Than fancy's feet have ever trod.\" I congratulate you, my friends, that you have at length been able to secure so appropriate, so desirable a resting place for yourselves and your children. It is honorable alike to the public spirit and the private enterprise that have been engaged in its acquisition. Nature has done much, but taste, and skill, and affection, will do still more in the future years of its history to make it a very Mecca of the mind and heart. It is fitting that it should be consecrated by public and solemn acts of devotion to Almighty God, by the voice of prayer and the swelling tide of sacred song, for here in after years is to be gathered a great congre gation of your loved and honored ones. We stand here today, surrounded by the emblems and memorials of the fading year, and legibly written around us is the inscription \" Passing away.\" The sighing wind and the deciduous leaf of autumn are the harbingers and witnesses of that temporary death that falls upon the natural world. Bud and leaf and flower and fruit have alike yielded to the inev itable law by which death follows life, and suspended ani mation the freshness and glory as well of nature as of sentient existence. These emblems are not unfitting accompaniments of this day and this occasion, reminding us, as they do, of our own mortality, and of the change that will come to us as it has to the millions that have gone before and will succeed us, \u2014 \" for we all do fade as a leaf.\" But over all this scene another change shall pass.

But Spring, with its balmy breath and softly distilling showers, shall come again. Suspended nature shall hear its voice and listen to its footsteps, and leap up and sing rejoicingly. And, in like manner, the lifeless re mains that may in after years be deposited here, shall be awakened and re-animated, for \" Spring shall re-visit the mouldering urn, And day dawn again on the night of the grave. Upon all these now denuded oaks \u2014 upon dying flower and shrub, and upon every withered blade of grass, is written the inscription \u2014 \u25a0\" TResurgimus\" And upon every monu mental stone or tablet to be erected here, may also be en graved the same blessed word of promise and of hope. And still another day shall come in the far future, and yet another spectacle shall be witnessed here, transcending all that earth has yet seen of fearful interest or glorious gran deur. A great assembly shall stand, once more, and for the last time, upon this ground. \"The leaves will have ceased to fall. Then the grass will no more fade. Memorials will have done their work.

ARTICLE in. INTERMENTS, Section 1. \u2014 Graves shall not be less than six feet deep, and sliall be dug only by persons in the employ of the Asso ciation and under the direction of the Superintendent of the grounds. The Trustees suggest that a four inch brick wall be built entirely around the coffin, and a stone slab laid over it, and the earth packed above. When parties desire this, notice must be given to the Superintendent, and the same will be done at reasonable charge. Sec 2. \u2014 Whenever interments are to be made, at least eight hours previous notice thereof must be given to the Su perintendent, and at the same time the size of the coffin, measured on the top ; or, if in a case, the size of the case should be mentioned. And when interments are to be made in private lots, the location of the grave in the lot should be stated. In case the above notice is not given, an extra charge may be made for digging the grave. Sec. 3.\u2014 It is proposed to erect a Receiving Tomb for the"], [57, "OAKWOOD CEMETERY. 49 purpose of depositing bodies therein during the winter months, and for the accommodation of those who intend to purchase lots. Thirty days from the time of deposit in the Tomb will be allowed for making the selection of lot and re moving the remains.

Three dollars shall be paid for depositing and retaining a body in the Receiving Tomb for the space of thirty days ; three dollars for an additional term of six months, and three dollars for each month thereafter. Sec 5. \u2014 Single graves may be procured in public lots ap propriated for that purpose, at eight dollars each, for an adult, and five dollars for a child ; which price will include the opening, closing and sodding the grave. If lots should af terwards be purchased, and the bodies removed, the full cost of the graves located will be allowed, after deducting the ex penses for the original interment and for the disinterment of the remains. ARTICLE IV. CONCERNING VISITORS. [A map is being prepared. By examining this, and giv ing due attention to the guide boards, visitors will find no difficulty in passing through the grounds.] 4"], [58, "50 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. Section 1.\u2014 Each proprietor of a lot will be entitled to a ticket of admission into the Cemetery with a vehicle, under the following regulations, the violation of which, or a loan of the ticket, involves a forfeiture of the privilege. Sec 2. \u2014 No vehicle will be admitted unless accompanied by a proprietor, or member of his or her household, with his or her ticket, or unless presenting a special ticket of admis sion obtained at the office of the Cemetery, or of a Trustee. Sec. 3. \u2014 On Sundays and holydays the gates will be closed. Proprietors of lots, however, will be admitted, on foot, by applying to the Keeper at the lodge. Sec 4. \u2014 Fast driving will be especially prohibited, and no vehicle will be allowed to pass through the grounds at a rate exceeding three miles an hour. Sec 5. \u2014 No persons or parties having refreshments to sell, will be permitted to come within the grounds, nor will any smoking be allowed. Sec 6. \u2014 No horse may be left by the driver in the grounds unfastened. Hitching posts are provided for that purpose. Any person violating the above rule, or fastening his horse to a tree, will be required by the Superintendent to leave the grounds forthwith. Sec. 7. \u2014 All persons are prohibited from writing upon, defacing, or otherwise injuring any monument, fence, or other structure in or belonging to the Cemetery, or from picking any flowers, either wild or cultivated, or injuring any tree, shrub or plant. Sec. 8. \u2014 Any person disturbing the quiet and good order ofthe place, by noise or other improper conduct, will be compelled instantly to leave the grounds. Sec 9.\u2014 The gates will be opened at sunrise, and closed for entrance) at sunset."], [59, "51 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. Visitors are reminded that these grounds are appropriated exclusively to the interment of the dead. It is therefore in dispensable that there should be a strict observance of all the proprieties due to the place. The Superintendent, being clothed with the powers of a special policeman, will be re quired to arrest disorderly persons. SUGGESTIONS TO LOT OWNERS. Durability of Improvements. \u2014 When it is borne in mind that the design of this Association is to provide family burial, not merely for the present, or succeeding, but for many, and for all future generations, too much importance cannot be attached to the form and manner of the improvements made by the proprietors of lots. To render the grounds increas ingly attractive, not only should good taste pervade every improvement and embellishment, but the materials used for enclosures and monumental structures should be of such a nature, and the mode of construction of such a kind, as to secure the greatest possible degree of durability and perma nency. Unless great care is exercised in these particulars, the lapse of a few years will give to the grounds the appear ance of dilapidation and decay. If, however, proper care and attention be exercised in designing, ordering, and exe cuting the improvements to be made, and especially if lot owners will avail themselves of the wise provisions of the general law, for the repair, preservation and renewal of the"], [60, "52 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. various enclosures, monuments and tombs which are or may be erected, they will ensure to themselves and their succes sors for many generations, not only a permanent, but a de cent and tasteful place of repose for the dead. Monuments. \u2014 In regard to monuments, too much care and attention cannot be bestowed, if by such attention, perma nency be secured. The foundation should be laid strongly in cement, and be not less than six feet deep \u2014 the usual depth of graves. The stone of which the structure is made, should in all cases be solid, and made to lie on a natural bed. Monuments built up, faced with thin slabs of marble or stone, and filled in with common masonry, will not last. It is a species of veneering and mantle-piece work, that will not long abide the exposure to which it is subjected- nor will stone, if solid, long endure, unless it be made to lie on what is termed its natural bed. Most kinds of stone and marble are composed of different strata, or layers, like the leaves of a book. If the stones are placed edgewise, or ver tically, so as to expose the strata to the action of the weather and the frost, they will, in time, split asunder and the whole structure will fall into ruin and decay. Tombs. \u2014 The same remarks will apply with equal if not greater force, in respect to tombs built in part or wholly above ground. In such structures great care is needed in the plan and construction which may be adopted. The stones should be of sufficient size to extend frequently through the wall, not mere slabs set up on the edge, forming no bond of union between the outer and inner surface. Where angles occur, each alternate course should unite the walls by means of solid stones cut to the angle required, so"], [61, "53 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. as to render a separation of the walls impossible, unless by a general destruction of the whole. When placed in the hill side, the parts above the natural surface should be of cut stone, the sides as well as the front, so as to avoid all artificial em bankments and sodding. In this way the natural form of the hill will be preserved, unseemly, artificial mounds will be prevented, and, ultimately, much expense will be saved in being free from the necessity, which will otherwise exist, of frequently renewing and repairing the embankments which are made. The roof should always be of stone tiles, or of flagging, the former being more tasteful, is to be preferred. Tombs faithfully built in this way, may safely be depended upon for centuries. Vaults. \u2014 Vaults under ground should be built of stone walls at least 18 inches thick, with arch of hard brick 12 inches thick, and all laid in the best of cement ; lime should not be used for work under ground ; nor is it well to use it any way for monumental purposes when good fresh cement can be procured. Variety in Monuments. \u2014 As the permanency of monu ments and their enclosures is essential to the decent appear ance of the grounds, so are the character and variety of the structures essential to a permanently pleasing effect on the mind. On this subject, also, too much thought can hardly be bestowed. The experience of other similar institutions appeals strongly and opportunely on this point to the lot owners. They have it in their power, at this early period in the history of the institution, to avoid an error of which the others so justly complain. In a recent publication of the"], [62, "54 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. Laurel Hill Cemetery Association, of Philadelphia, occurs the following passage : \"There is another suggestion which the managers feel it their duty to make to lot owners ; they trust it will be re ceived as an evidence that they are anxious to unite in car rying out the original intention of creating at Laurel Hill a toute ensemble which shall evince that, with superior facili ties, there is growing up an improved taste in monumental sculpture. It has been the frequent remark of visitors\u2014 our own citizens as well as strangers \u2014 that a monotony already begins to be apparent in the style and form of the improve ments ; obelisk succeeds obelisk, etc., with only slight varia tions, and if this is continued, we shall see, in time, too dull a uniformity to strike the mind with agreeable sentiments. This may be obviated by a little more enquiry before order ing a monument, and by not always taking the advice of the stone-mason, often himself willing to suggest the greatest bulk for the least money, and thus allowing marble to usurp the place of good taste.\" * * * * # \"A correct idea, expressed in marble, may be very beau tiful, so long as it is unique; but by too frequent imitation, and in too close proximity with its original, it may destroy the charm of the first, and ultimately raise feelings in the beholder the reverse of those desired.\" It can hardly be doubted that these remarks, so forcibly expressive ot true criticism and correct taste, will exercise a favorable and justly controlling influence on the future improvements erected by the proprietors of Oakwood. Inscriptions on Monuments. \u2014 A suggestion on this sub ject is ventured with diffidence, yet not without hope that it"], [63, "55 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. may be of some use. While good taste proscribes, in all cases, fulsome eulogies of the departed, it does not forbid all notice of their virtues. The best feelings of our nature seem to demand something more than a mere record of name and birth and death. A simple, brief and appropriate epitaph proves not less interesting and instructive to the casual pas ser by, than to those who mourn more deeply the loss of those whom it coinmemmorates. Nor will it be one of the least objects of interest to those who in after times visit these grounds, to read the records which friendship and affection place here upon the monumental stone. Shrubbery. \u2014 In regard to shrubbery it will be well to re member that only certain kinds will do well in the shade. In ordering plants, therefore, satisfactory information on this point ought to be obtained before designating such as are to be placed under the foliage of the forest. Aid to Proprietors. \u2014 Proprietors contemplating making improvements will have every facility extended to them by the Superintendent, who will furnish information, and, if de. sired, superintend the execution of work. Importance of Improvements. \u2014 It is much to be wished that lot-owners generally would make their improvements as early as their convenience will permit. Every improvement made, adds, in a greater or less degree, to the appearance and interest of the grounds. Care of Lots.\u2014 It is very desirable, as well for the general appearance of the Cemetery, as for the satisfaction of propri etors, that such lots as are improved should be kept in proper"], [64, "56 OAKWOOD CEMETERY. order, the grass cut, the weeds eradicated and the shrubbery carefully attended to. Those who wish their lots taken care of in this way, may have it done for the sum of two dollars each lot per annum, it being understood that it is optional with with them to make this arrangement or not, as they may desire."], [65, "APPENDIX A.
