ROMANTICALLY situated on the fertile banks of the river Avon, an antique mansion, formerly the private residence of the famous Sir Guy of Warwick, rears its turretted roof amid the dense foliage of the trees which surround it, while a small part of its gothic looking front is seen from the high road leading from Warwick to Kenil worth, as you look down an avenue of old Scotch firs, blending their boughs closely together at the top, which in a great measure exclude the light penetrating through them, and cast around a solemn gloom on the grass walk beneath. Upon a nearer approach to the mansion, which is of unique structure, in the old monastic style, it is perceived that it is built upon a rock, part of whicb, facing the Avon, rears itself in the form of a cliff, partially overgrown with brambles, and crowned with overhanging beech and chestnut tiees ; beneath which a green sloping bank,"], [8, "4 GUY's-CLIFF, OR THE planted here and there with low shrubs \u2014 laurestinus and junipers \u2014 extends down to the river, whose glassy stream picturesquely meanders ulon<; the boundary, occasionally under llie shades of ancient ash trees that grow on (lie margin, spreading their wide branches across the rippling water.

Still winding along the path, on the margin ofthe Avon, with the cliff ris ing above your head on the right, you arrive at the entrance of a gloomy excavation in the cliff, and proceeding down a narrow passage, you soon be hold a dark vaulted cave, into which a transparent rill gushing from a mossy crevice of the rock, empties its limpid stream, and is said to be the bath in which Sir Guy used to refresh himself evpry morning. Several other excavations in the cliff are also worthy of observation, particularly the one in which we are told that Sir Guy pined himself away in gloomy solitude, having alone the bats and owls for his nocturnal companions, flitting around the entrance of his darksome abode, or singing tlieir mournful dirge in the dark cedars"], [9, "5 CAVERN OF DESPAIR. hard by; while the silent moon, in brightest splen dour, shad her silvery beams upon the rippling Avon, whose glittering surface shone as bright as gold, save where a solitary cypress cast its sombre shadow on the water. Now proceeding along a narrow walk, winding its serpentine course up the cliff, with wild flowers, bushes, and trees growing on each side of the way, and banging over at in tervals, it is pleasant to look down from tbe emi nence upon the lawn and river below, through the openings of the trees which occasionally present themselves from abrupt declivities, giving you a beautiful view of the adjoining grounds, the an cient mill, with the waterfall and bridge across it. And as you higher still ascend, you meet with a rugged rampart, formed by Nature in the rock, which commands a limited but picturesque pros pect ofthe scenery beneath, giving a slight glimpse at the fertile meadows beyond the Avon, bedecked with mantle green, enamelled over with yellow flowers; and upon which rampart you may easily fancy Sir Guy look delight in keeping his mid night vigils, clad in all the warlike accoutrements of feudal chivalry ; while, as the turret clock tolled the solemn hour of twelve, a beautiful lady, dressed in flowing robe of purest white, with face of pensive loveliness, walked with graceful step upon the dewy lawn below, ever and anon casting upraised eyes of heaven's blue towards the dark some knight, as on his gleaming spear he leant his"], [10, "6 guy's-cliff, or the stately form ; and then perchance she might have serenaded him with a song, not very unlike the following: \u2014 Why watch you on that rampart there, So lonely and so sad ; Within thy breast must dark despair Ne'er let thy soul be glad ? Say, noble knight, what bids thee mourn And midnight vigils keep ? Hath blighted love left thee to mourn In sorrow dark and deep : Oh ! say not so, \u2014 for Zarah loyes Her fond and faithful knight, And to his gloomy cave she roves Her sacred vows to plight. Yes, she adores her good Sir Guy, And ever true will be : For pleasure in her beaming eye No other youth shall Bee. Then come aod place the hallow'd ring Upon my finger now, And wreaths of blushing roses bring To crown my pearly brow; For I'll be thine 'till death shall part,\u2014 Thy fair and lovely bride ; To thee I'll give my life\u2014 my heart,\u2014 And never, never chide! At which encouraging song the gloomy Sir Guy, seeming nothing comforted, probably gave the following reply : \u2014 Oh, Zarah ! thou art false and fair As ever maid can he ; Could 1 believe that still you are So faithful unto n%?

Which song Sir Guy having sung in a deep sc-puU chral tone of voice, instantly disappeared from the fair Zarah's view, and was lost among the dense foliage of the trees which hung over the cliff whereon he stood ; so here we will leave him alone to indulge in his gloomy solitude; for the beautiful Zarah, being quite hopeless of ever changing his melancholy mood, retired to a convent far away, and remained a nun all the rest of her days.

Some years ago I was much struck with the sight of this picture, and learnt from the housekeeper who attended me to point out the va rious objects most worthy of notice about the man sion, that it was painted by a handsome youth Ofa very romantic turn of mind, during an excursion in Italy, who would have inherited Guy's Cliff and the estate belonging to it had he survived his father; but alas! he died in the prime of youth, leaving his disconsolate parents to weep in vain over his untimely loss; and his portrait, a truly elegant one, hung in the drawing-room at the time 1 was there. The story I ara going to tell, relating to the subject of the picture, is as follows: \u2014 Upon the borders of Lake Locarno, in the duchy of Milan, is an antique chateau, formerly belonging to Count Rinaldo, an Italian nobleman of high and ancient desefent. It stands on a beautiful romantic emi nence, commanding from its terraced gardens a"], [14, "10 guy's-cliff, or the full view of the wide azure lake below, and tbe sublime scenery of the towering hills around, clothed on all sides with fruitful vineyards and umbrageous olive groves, beyond whicli the hoary summits of the surrounding mountains majestically rise through the atmosphere at a distance. Count Umaldo had an only daughter, whose name was Antoinette. She was a perfect Italian beauty, wilh most exquisitely formed features and symmetry ; while her dark auburn hair flowed in a profusion of glossy ringlets each side of her glowing cheeks, and seemed to revel with luxurious ecstacy upon her heaving bosom. Her eyes were large and as black as jet, brightly sparkling beneath beautifully fringed eyelashes and finely arched eyebrows, while they shed their smiling beams over her ex pressive face, as soft as twilight on the bloom ofthe damask rose ! Aud to heighten the loveliness of these fascinating charms, she was a most amiable disposition, possessing a sensitive heart, warmed with all tbe finest and softest feelings belonj>in<i to her endearing sex. A young cavalier, named Francisco, who was the youngest son of a German family of distinction fell desperately in love with Antoinette, as he chanced to see her one beautiful summer's evening playing on her guitar, while she sung a plaintive strain to its modulated chords, as she sat before a fountain beneath an alcove clustered over with myrtles and roses on a balustraded terrace in her"], [15, "11 CAVERN OF DESPAIR. garden near the lake, upon which Francisco was being rowed in a gondola, enjoying the salubrity of the air, and the charming prospect of the ro mantic scenery around, while he listened with en raptured ear to the sweet song of the fair Antoi nette, which was as follows : \u2014 How lovely is Locarno's lake, Upon a tranquil summer's night, When not a breeze appears to break The Bmoothness of its mirror bright! 'Tis sweet to watch the setting sun Sink o'er the distant mountains far, Just as the glorious day is done, And beams iu heav'u the evening star. Fair Italy, thou land of love, Of olive proves, and fruitful vines. With cloudless sky so blue above, Whose canopy in splendour shines; Thy valleys aud thy rivers are All beautiful unto my view, Displaying prospects wond'rous fair, Of Nature's freshest living hue ! Oh ! let me pass my life away On Lake Locarno's peaceful shore, Which looks so bright when Cynthia'** ray The azure water silvers o'er; While gondolas that glide along, Kow'd by the tuneful gondolier, Re-echo with the plaintive song Which tells of plighted love sincere.

Like fairy music ou the gale It sweetly dies away ; Soft as the note of nightingale At close of summer's day. When Cynthia smiles upon the lake, And gilds the water bright, As o'er the waves my course I take Amid her flood of light, Oh! then I love to gaze on thee Beneath the rosy bow'r, Aud listen te thy melody, Which charms the silent hour. Then fairest maiden do not frown Upon the strain I breathe, And o'er thy lovely brow a crown Of roses 1 will wreathe. My heart is true\u2014 my vow sincere\u2014 Thee I adore alone! Thou hast no cause my love to fear, Although my name's unknown. Francisco not long after this obtained an in troduction to the fair Anlionette at a grand masked ball, given by a wealthy old baron, who lived at"], [17, "13 CAVERN OF DESPAIR, a splendid chateau in the neighbourhood ; and there he took an early opportunity of further com municating his ardent attachment to her as he led her to the dance, or promenaded through the lofty saloons, tastefully decorated with ftstoons of beau tiful flowers, and brilliantly illuminated with va riegated lamps for lhe occasion. His enraptured feelings were very soon re turned by the blushing Antionette with mutual ardour, as Francisco was a particularly handsome and graceful person, combined with the most elegant manners and address. This led to their having repeated stolen meetings together on the terrace in her garden near the lake, which was a strictly retired spot, luxuriantly wooded with palm, orange, lemon, citron, olive, and a variety of other blossoming trees, beneath whose umbra geous foliage serpentine walks wound in various directions through blooming rosiaries, terminating occasionally in Venetian alcoves, or artificial cas cades, and iu every way adapted to the secrecy that their intercourse lequired ; as Count Rinaldo was of a most ambitious disposition, haughtily proud of his ancestral dignity, and had already in his mind's eye fixed upon a matrimonial alliance for the lovely Antionette, who was just ripening into the fascinating perfection of womanhood. The last lime Francisco and Antionette met upon the wonted terrace, it was a serene summer's evening, when the sun had sunk beneath the high"], [18, "14 GUYS-CLIFF, OR THE range ofthe distant mountains, and the full moon, rising in majestic splendour over their dark sum mits, shed a brond stream of glittering light upon the smooth surface of Lake Locarno, in whose lucid mirror a thousand stars and the romantic scenery around were clearly reflected ; and on this occasion Francisco sung, with more than usual pathos, the following song : \u2014 How lovely the moon o'er the monntain is beaming. Which sheds her bright lustre upon the clear lake ! While sweet flow'ry valleys around us are gleaming, And blossoms are smiling which bloom in the brake; Delightful it is when all Nature is sleeping, To breathe forth my love to my fair Antoinette, As on the lone terrace our vigils we're keeping. And plight those fond vows that we'll never forget. Oh ! the glorious heavens so -ofilv are shining With thousands of stars that beam brightly on high, Which come forth like lovers when daylight's declining, Aud bashfully smile in the azure blue skv ! Oh! this is the hour, when young hearts with warm feeling Pour forth from their bosoms their burthen of love, As unto each other they'ie fondly revealing Joy that would be priz'd by the angels above. I sigh not for splendour while I am possessing The pride of my bosom who sits by my side, For sweet is the life that is spent in caressing Thebeautifnl maiden I woo for my bride; Let mercen'ry loverg still seek after money, I'd care not though fortune should grant me no more, If from thy pure lips I might sip virgin honey, And bask in thy smiles till my days had pass'd o'er. Francisco had finished his harmonious strain, and they were now sitting together beneath an"], [19, "CAVERN OF DESPAIR. 15 alcove in view of the lake; Antoinette's blushing cheek fondly resting on the throbbing bosom of Francisco, while they were enjoying thesweetest and purest conversation that young enthusiastic lovers delight in, as the nightingale warbled her melodious strain among the blossoming boughs of the fragrant pomegranate, which gracefully spread its lightsome foliage hard by ; and they had al ready settled their plans for an elopement on the following night, when Count Rinaldo, (who had just discovered the whole affair through the vigi lance of a trusty old servant,) with a numerous retinue of attendants, in an instant rushed out of a grove of orange trees upon them, and bore the sainting Antoinette from the distracted arms of her desperate and struggling lover, who, like a fu rious lion overpowered by superior numbers, was forced, at length to yield up his valued prize. In vain did Francisco seek for an interview with the unhappy Antoinette after this unfortu nate occurrence; but could not get even the least titlings of her, until one fine summer's morning as he was rambling alone through the olive groves, in the neighbourhood of Count Rinaldo's chateau, (hoping to get a slight glimpse ofhis adored An toinette in the balcony of her own boudoir, where he thought that she might possibly be permitted to perambulate for the benefit of the fresh air,) when he was attracted by a group of Italian peasants, who were flocking round a small chapel not far"], [20, "GUY's-CLIFF, OR THE 16 distant from the chateau, as if they were wait ing to witness some procession about to pass by. Francisco drew near with a palpitating heart, and learned from one of the bystanders that the nup tials of a wealthy old Baron to a beautiful young heiress were being performed within, which tidings greatly agitated Francisco's feelings. But now the ceremony was over, and lhe company began to issue from the chapel, and proceeded to the splendid equipages awaiting the reception of the united couple; and after a numerous train of at tendants had made their appearance, then came the bridegroom, an old decrepid-looking man about sixty ye;<rs osage, with his elegantly attiretl bride, who seemed to be a beautiful young crea ture just blooming iuto the maturity of woman hood, but a long white flowing veil partially screened her lovely features from the vulgar gaze ofthe crowd. Francisco fixed his eyes intensely upon her, and she, raising up her silvery veil with her slender white hand, discovered the tearful face of the fair Antionette ; \u2014 then gazing piteously upon him she uttered a piercing shriek, aud sunk in a swoon upon the ground. At which sight Francisco, being worked up to the greatest fit of madness and despair, hastily drew a dagger from his breast, and plunged it into the heart of the un natural old bridegroom, who instantly fell dead at his feet, which unpremeditated revenge being accom plished, Francisco, in a fit of frenzy, immediately"], [21, "17 CAVEISN OF DESPAIR. fled to the mountains, where he was discovered by some hunters a few weeks afterwards, entirely de ranged in a dark gloomy cave, in the miserable state the wretched vi ctim of woe is described in \" The Cavern of Despair.\" Upon being made prisoner by the hunters, he gave a desperate convulsive struggle and springing from their grasp, was precipitated over a deep precipice, whose fearful gulf can tell the rest of his mournful tale.
